                                                  Chapter 1

                                        GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.1. Responsibilities of The Judge Advocate General (TJAG). TJAG responsibilities are as written in
this instruction and must be consistent with Secretary of the Air Force Orders 111.1, Functions and Duties
of the General Counsel, April 26, 1999, and 111.5, Delineation of Responsibilities of the General Counsel
and the Judge Advocate General, October 30, 1997. Those acting on behalf of TJAG (such as the various
civil litigation divisions in the Air Force Legal Services Agency [AFLSA] and the International and Oper-
ations Law Division [HQ USAF/JAI]) may perform the functions detailed in paragraph 1.1.3. Addition-
ally:
    1.1.1. Commands subordinate to HQ USAF and AFLSA must not initiate or take any action pertain-
    ing to these responsibilities unless TJAG specifically authorizes them.
    1.1.2. Commands and judge advocates should make every effort to identify causes of action in favor
    of the United States and promptly notify the proper division in the office of TJAG or AFLSA.
    1.1.3. The Judge Advocate General, in coordination with the Office of the Air Force General Counsel
    (SAF/GC):
       1.1.3.1. Protects the interests of the United States Air Force in legal and administrative proceed-
       ings in the United States and foreign countries.
       1.1.3.2. Maintains close liaison with the Department of Justice (DoJ) to:
           1.1.3.2.1. Obtain evidence to support the government's position.
           1.1.3.2.2. Prepare pleadings and briefs.
           1.1.3.2.3. Compile and evaluate evidence.
           1.1.3.2.4. Litigate or assist in the litigation of civil cases.
       1.1.3.3. Makes Air Force recommendations about:
           1.1.3.3.1. Initiating legal actions and appeals in domestic and foreign courts in significant Air
           Force cases. (Except for appeals involving Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals cases).
           1.1.3.3.2. Accepting proposed compromises or settlements of pending litigation or controver-
           sies in significant Air Force cases, including those in foreign countries.
       1.1.3.4. Coordinates closely with other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, the General
       Accounting Office (GAO), and other federal agencies in procuring evidence to support the gov-
       ernment's position.
       1.1.3.5. Negotiates and presents evidence, pleadings, and briefs to federal, state, and municipal
       regulatory bodies in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.
    1.1.4. The appropriate civil litigation division of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI, on behalf of TJAG, ordi-
    narily determines who may appear as an attorney or counsel for the Air Force in a civil judicial or
    administrative action (foreign or domestic). As a matter of written Air Force legal policy, as estab-
    lished by TJAG or SAF/GC, there may already be existing delegation for installation level judge
    advocates and attorneys to appear on behalf of the Air Force before certain administrative bodies. In
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                              9


   cases where direct representation of the United States before a state, federal or foreign court is
   involved, the concurrence of DoJ may be required.
   1.1.4. (USAFE) This does not preclude the appearance or presence, without such authorization, of
   judge advocates or Department of the Air Force civilian attorneys before such courts, administrative
   boards, government agencies as: Observers, Liaison officers, Amicus curiae, or to assist counsel
   employed by the Department of Justice, a foreign government, or an Air Force contractor concerned
   in conducting the case.
   1.1.5. No person on active duty with the Air Force, or employed in a civilian or reserve capacity by
   the Air Force, may appear or represent any individual, corporation, association, or other outside entity
   as their attorney or counsel in a civil judicial or administrative action (foreign or domestic) without the
   written permission of TJAG or TJAG’s designee.

1.2. Representing the Air Force and Air Force Officials Sued in Their Official Capacities. DoJ has
the statutory responsibility to represent the Air Force and Air Force officials who are being sued in their
official capacities (Title 28, United States Code, Sections 516-519). This responsibility extends to litiga-
tion in foreign courts. (However, see Title 10, United States Code, Section 1037 and AR 27-50/SEC-
NAVINST 5820.4G/AFJI 51-706, Status Of Forces Policies, Procedures, And Information, 15 December
1989.)
   1.2.1. Occasionally, this responsibility is delegated entirely to TJAG.
   1.2.2. When the Attorney General is served a copy of a complaint, DoJ formally requests that the
   appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division send a litigation report to the attorney defending the Air
   Force official.
   1.2.3. Installation staff judge advocates (SJAs) or other Air Force officials gather the specific infor-
   mation and documents to comply with DoJ requests, and forward such information and documents to
   the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI.

1.3. Requests by Air Force Officials for Representation by DoJ. Past or present Air Force personnel
or employees who are named as individual defendants for personal liability in civil or criminal proceed-
ings for acts or omissions arising from the performance of their official Air Force duties may request rep-
resentation by DoJ (see Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 50.15, and 50.16). NOTE:
Because personnel sued in their personal capacity may have as little as twenty (20) days to respond
to a complaint, time is of the essence in processing these requests.
   1.3.1. DoJ will not defend an individual against a federal criminal action.
   1.3.2. Under certain circumstances, Air Force contractors being sued by third parties may also
   request government representation.
   1.3.3. An individual who wants government representation:
       1.3.3.1. Writes a request (see Figure 1.1. for the request format) and sends it through the SJA or
       the official designated in paragraph 1.5.to HQ USAF/JAI or the appropriate AFLSA litigation
       division (see Chapter 2 through Chapter 7).
NOTE: Officials in the Secretariat send requests through SAF/GC.
10                                                                  AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


        1.3.3.2. Submits an affidavit or declaration (see Figure 1.2.) showing that the matter arose out of
        the performance of official Air Force duties.
        1.3.3.3. Submits an affidavit or declaration (see Figure 1.3.) from the requester’s commander or
        supervisor stating that:
            1.3.3.3.1. He or she has read the complaint and the requester's affidavit or declaration.
            1.3.3.3.2. The matter arose out of the performance of official Air Force duties.
     1.3.4. Air Force personnel may request, from the nearest installation SJA, the assistance of Air Force
     legal counsel in preparing their request for representation. If such counsel is provided, an attorney-cli-
     ent relationship will exist between the Air Force counsel and the requesting Air Force employee until
     a decision on the representation request is reached, or the assistance is voluntarily terminated by one
     or more of the parties involved. Communications and confidences shared between the Air Force coun-
     sel and the requesting Air Force employee for purposes of the provided legal assistance shall be priv-
     ileged. Air Force personnel who are required to have access to such privileged information for the
     purpose of processing the request are also required to maintain the privilege. Given this privilege, and
     because of the SJA’s inherent duties to administer military justice and investigate claims or potential
     claims against the Air Force, SJAs should exercise caution in the assignment of personnel to process
     these requests. Any subsequent representation of the employee by DoJ attorney or US Attorney per-
     sonnel shall also be considered to be covered by the attorney-client privilege.
     1.3.5. Requests for representation of Air Force personnel shall be forwarded to the appropriate civil
     law division (JACL, JACN, JACE, or JACT) of the Air Force Legal Services Agency, or to HQ
     USAF/JAI, if foreign criminal or civil proceedings are involved. (Note: See Chapter 2 through
     Chapter 7 for more information on the litigation subject matter coverage of these various divisions
     and offices.) Requests for representation of Air Force contractors should be forwarded to SAF/GCQ.
     Attorney-client privileged information should not be forwarded with the request unless absolutely
     necessary to the processing of the request. In such instance, SJAs should only forward privileged
     information with the written consent of the requester, and the prior approval and knowledge of the
     receiving AFLSA civil litigation division, HQ USAF/JAI, or SAF/GCQ, as applicable.
     1.3.6. Provision of representation and continuation of the representation is within the sole discretion
     of the Attorney General or appropriate designee. Representation of Air Force personnel will be based
     upon the following criteria:
        1.3.6.1. That the actions or omissions of the Air Force personnel being complained of occurred
        within the scope of employment;
        1.3.6.2. That the representation is in the interest of the United States; and
        1.3.6.3. That there is no unresolved conflict of interest between the United States and the Air
        Force personnel to be represented as to their relative legal positions.
     1.3.7. Representation of Air Force personnel by private counsel at federal expense, or with reim-
     bursement of the private counsel fees, may be provided at the discretion of the Attorney General, and
     under the same criteria as in paragraph 1.3.6. (The amount of reimbursement is determined through
     fee schedules set by the Civil Division of DoJ. For information on current fee schedules, please con-
     tact the Director, Constitutional Torts Staff, Civil Division, at (202) 616-4140.) Such defense repre-
     sentation may be provided under the following circumstances:
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                           11


      1.3.7.1. In some rare federal criminal proceedings where it is in the interest of the United States
      and in accordance with the limitations of 28 CFR 50.16;
      1.3.7.2. In subject matter-related civil, congressional or state criminal proceedings where federal
      criminal proceedings prohibit representation by DoJ or US Attorney personnel;
      1.3.7.3. In cases involving the representation of multiple Air Force personnel with conflicting or
      potentially conflicting legal or factual positions that make representation by one attorney inappro-
      priate;
      1.3.7.4. In cases where the Solicitor General declines to authorize seeking further appellate
      review by the United States; or
      1.3.7.5. In cases when DoJ personnel involved become aware that continued representation of the
      Air Force personnel could involve the assertion of a position that conflicts with the interests of the
      United States.
   1.3.8. The government will not be responsible for the expenses of individuals who hire private coun-
   sel without express prior authorization except in circumstances beyond the individual's control, such
   as government dilatoriness or inaction, in which it then becomes necessary to hire private counsel in
   order to protect the individual's interests. Ordinarily, the government will not be responsible for any
   judgments made against individuals in their personal capacities.

1.4. Indemnification Requests.
   1.4.1. The Air Force usually cannot indemnify Air Force members or employees for any verdict,
   judgment, settlement, or other monetary award entered against them in their personal capacities. The
   Air Force considers a request for indemnification if:
      1.4.1.1. The conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment, settlement, or award was within the
      member's or employee's scope of employment; and
      1.4.1.2. It is in the interest of the United States to indemnify the individual.
   1.4.2. The Air Force member or employee seeking indemnification must submit a signed, written
   request to his or her servicing SJA and include:
      1.4.2.1. Copies of all documents proving liability.
      1.4.2.2. An explanation of how the conduct that created the liability was within the requester's
      scope of employment or official duties.
      1.4.2.3. An explanation of how indemnification would be in the interest of the United States.
      1.4.2.4. A statement indicating if the requester has insurance or any other source of indemnifica-
      tion, and whether the requester has sought indemnification from such source.
      1.4.2.5. This declaration:

         "I understand that the Air Force's acceptance of this request for indemnification for processing
      in accordance with AFI 51-301 does not constitute an acceptance of any obligation by the Air
      Force to make such indemnification. Any indemnification that the Air Force might make is a per-
      missive action taken solely in the interest of the United States and not for my personal benefit."
12                                                                 AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


     1.4.3. Requesters must include with the request a recommendation by the servicing SJA specifically
     addressing each requirement of paragraph 1.4.2.Send the request and recommendation through SJA
     channels with recommendations from each level to the chief of the appropriate litigation division.
     Comments from the SJA at major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA), or direct
     reporting unit (DRU) are particularly important.
     1.4.4. Before forwarding a recommendation in favor of indemnification to the appropriate AFLSA
     civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU SJA coordinates the recom-
     mendation with that level FM.
        1.4.4.1. The chief of the responsible litigation division sends the request and recommendations,
        through channels, to the appropriate Secretarial designee for a decision.
        1.4.4.2. If there is insufficient time to submit an indemnification request through normal chan-
        nels, submit the request directly to the Chief, General Litigation Division, who coordinates with
        the appropriate SJAs.
     1.4.5. The requester must include all documents or information necessary to process the indemnifica-
     tion request.
     1.4.6. The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU pays indemnification from their funds unless SAF/FM decides to
     use other funds.
     1.4.7. Indemnity decisions by the Secretarial designee are final and not subject to appeal of any kind.

Force or any of its instrumentalities is a defendant (including cases where the United States is a defendant
and there is Air Force involvement) or Air Force officials are being personally sued for actions within
their official capacity. Report new litigation by immediately telephoning the civil litigation division that
normally handles such cases. Follow the directions of the assigned action officer with regard to forward-
ing the complaint to the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI, and as to whether
or not a litigation report is required. Installation level staff judge advocates or, in accordance with para-
graph 1.6., other responsible officials should also notify the relevant, responsible numbered air force legal
office (NAF/JA) and major command legal office (MAJCOM/JA) of new litigation. All are encouraged to
call the appropriate office with any questions they may have about the preparation, content, or submission
of a litigation report.
   1.8.1. If a formal litigation report is required:
       1.8.1.1. Submit it in letter form to the appropriate civil litigation division as soon as possible after
       telephonic notification of the litigation. (See Figure 1.4. for a suggested format.)

       tion report to the relevant MAJCOM. (See Chapter 2 for information on FTCA cases). This report
       gives the litigation division enough information to formulate responses to the factual allegations in
       the complaint.
       1.8.1.3. Include a detailed statement of the relevant facts and a summary of the procedural his-
       tory.
       1.8.1.4. Prepare, identify, handle and safeguard the litigation report to preserve its character as

       5, United States Code, Section 552a, is often, by necessity, included in the litigation report. Fur-
       ther, the case file records to be forwarded with the litigation report may be from a Privacy Act sys-
       tem of records or contain Privacy Act information. If so, the litigation report, the records, or both
14                                                                AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006

                                                   Chapter 2

                             FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT LITIGATION

2.1. Litigation Responsibility.
     2.1.1. DoJ, through the local US Attorney or the Civil Division at DoJ, handles tort litigation involv-
     ing the US as a plaintiff or a defendant.
     2.1.2. The Tort Claims and Litigation Division (AFLSA/JACT) assists DoJ with Air Force cases
     involving the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The Environmental Law and Litigation Division
     (AFLSA/JACE) assists DoJ with environmental cases involving the FTCA. AFLSA/JACT or /JACE
     normally retains litigation responsibility for all FTCA cases. However, AFLSA/JACT or /JACE may
     delegate litigation responsibility of a particular case to a installation while retaining overall control of
     litigation assistance. Delegations will be in writing from the chief of the division.

2.2. Handling Complaints Received at Installation Level.
     2.2.1. When you receive a complaint under the FTCA, immediately telephone AFLSA/JACT or /
     JACE with: the names of all parties to the litigation; the court involved; the case's docket number; the
     amount of damages requested; the nature of the litigation; and complete information regarding service
     of process, pleading suspense dates, and any information about other government agencies involved.
     2.2.2. Send the complaint to AFLSA/JACT or /JACE as soon as possible, by datafax and first class
     mail.
     2.2.3. If AFLSA/JACT or /JACE delegates the litigation support in a particular case to the installa-
     tion, prepare the litigation report (see paragraph 1.8.), then send it along with the complete original
     administrative claim file to the local defending US Attorney, and if requested by DoJ, send a copy of
     the litigation report to the Torts Branch, Civil Division, DoJ.
        2.2.3.1. Send litigation reports to the US Attorney or DoJ no later than 14 days before the answer
        is due.
        2.2.3.2. At the same time, send a copy of the complete claim file, pleadings, correspondence, and
        the litigation report to AFLSA/JACT or /JACE.

2.3. Handling Discovery Requests at Installation Level. In all cases, except when litigation support is
delegated to the installation on a particular case, AFLSA/JACT or /JACE will respond to all discovery
requests (interrogatories, document production, admissions) on behalf of the Air Force. However, the
installation may be tasked to assist in responding to the discovery request. When tasked to assist during
discovery, promptly respond in accordance with the specific guidance received from AFLSA/JACT or /
JACE.

2.4. Handling Personal Negligence Complaints Against Air Force Employees at Installation Level
-- Substitution.
     2.4.1. When a Complaint alleges common law negligence against an Air Force employee being sued
     in the employee’s personal capacity, substitution of the United States for the employee may be appro-
     priate under the FTCA.
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                        25


     2.4.1.1. Where substitution may be the appropriate remedy, the employee makes a request for
     representation under paragraph 1.3.Claims personnel investigate incidents within their geographic
     area of responsibility to ascertain the facts and circumstances. SJAs forward requests for represen-
     tation to AFLSA/JACT or /JACE with a recommendation as to whether or not the United States
     should be substituted for the employee. The SJA’s forwarding documents must include the appli-
     cable state law on scope of employment, and an analysis of whether the employee was acting in
     the scope of employment at the time of the incident giving rise to the lawsuit.
     2.4.1.2. The Air Force (i.e., AFLSAJACT or /JACE) forwards a recommendation to DoJ or the
     US Attorney whether or not substitution is appropriate.
     2.4.1.3. The decision to seek substitution of the United States for the employee resides with DoJ
     or the local US Attorney. Whether or not DoJ or the local US Attorney seeks substitution is based
     strictly upon whether or not the employee was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the
     incident. Scope of employment is determined by the applicable state law.
26                                                                 AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006

Section 3B—Civilian Personnel Litigation

3.3. General Information. The US Court of Federal Claims or federal district courts hear cases brought
by present or former civilian employees. These courts may permit trial de novo in Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) cases. Most other civilian personnel cases involve appeals based wholly or in part on
administrative records. (See Figure 3.1. for checklist items for the preparation of an administrative
record.)
     3.3.1. Civilian employees may appeal adverse decisions by the MSPB, and arbitrator decisions where
     the grievance involved a personnel action appealable to the MSPB, to the Court of Appeals for the
     Federal Circuit.
     3.3.2. The types of administrative records and litigation support at the beginning of litigation may
     vary widely. The litigation support requirements in paragraphs 3.3.3.through 3.3.5. are the minimum
     for each type of case. AFLSA/JACL may require additional support in certain cases.
     3.3.3. EEO Cases. Although employees may usually get a trial de novo, administrative records fre-
     quently play a central role in these cases. Accordingly, SJAs should promptly obtain these records,
     including a transcript of the administrative hearing, from the custodian and submit five copies with a
     litigation report per paragraph 1.8.
     3.3.4. MSPB Appeals. These appeals are based solely upon facts developed during MSPB adminis-
     trative hearings or arbitrations.
        3.3.4.1. The MSPB provides official copies of the record only to DoJ, not the agency involved.
        3.3.4.2. AFLSA/JACL usually encounters a lengthy delay before receiving a copy of this record.
            3.3.4.2.1. In these cases, SJAs must provide a detailed procedural history of the case and a
            description of issues raised in the administrative hearings instead of the formal litigation
            report.
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                          29


          3.3.4.2.2. Refer to and attach copies of relevant documents, including a transcript of the
          administrative hearing.
   3.3.5. Other Civilian Personnel Court Litigation. SJAs provide formal litigation reports with five cop-
   ies of the administrative records according to paragraph 1.8., unless AFLSA/JACL directs otherwise.

3.4. Administrative Cases. See Section 3Cfor litigation support requirements and responsibilities for
cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Labor Relations Authority, or Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.

   Materiel Command before the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Staff Judge Advocate, HQ
   AFMC, may delegate this authority to installation staff judge advocates within AFMC.
   3.5.3. What to Report. You must report:
       3.5.3.1. Unfair labor practice charges and complaints.

     CLLO or NGB/JA attorney for the case.

3.7. Requesting Representation and Assistance.
     3.7.1. The CLLO’s primary mission is to represent the interests of the Air Force in litigation before
     the Federal Labor Relations Authority. Resources permitting, CLLO representation is available for
     EEO, MSPB, or arbitration matters. An initial request for representation may be made by telephone.
     Oral requests for assistance must be followed up with a written request for representation within one
     workday. The written request for representation should include the reason for requesting assistance
     and a fund citation which the CLLO can use to cover its costs associated with the representation. Send
     the litigation report (prepared according to paragraph 1.8.) as soon as possible. (See paragraph 3.6.3.)
     3.7.2. CLLO provides legal advice and assistance in labor relations and other civilian personnel mat-
     ters. Air Force attorneys are encouraged to call the CLLO for assistance.

   corpus, even when that person has not yet filed suit.
   3.9.3. Send a copy of the complaint or petition and any allied papers to AFLSA/JACL as quickly as
   possible. You must assemble all pertinent documents as quickly as possible or as directed by the
   responsible attorney in AFLSA/JACL. (See paragraph 1.8.2.)
   3.9.4. For cases involving injunctive relief or habeas corpus, AFLSA/JACL sometimes permits direct
   contact between the office of the SJA and the US Attorney's Office. SJAs must nonetheless remember
   that litigation decisions and advice to the US Attorney's Office must come from AFLSA/JACL. The
   SJA must never agree to any form of injunctive relief or other legal restraints against the United States
   (see paragraph 1.1.). After responding expeditiously, you must prepare a formal litigation report (see
   paragraph 1.8.), unless AFLSA/JACL directs otherwise.

Section 3E—Utilities Litigation

3.10. Utility Litigation.
     3.10.1. Report any administrative proceedings before independent regulatory bodies involving utility
     rate changes that could result in annual rate increases for the installation of more than:
         3.10.1.1. $200,000 for electric, natural gas, water, or wastewater (sewage) service.
         3.10.1.2. $75,000 for telephone service.
         3.10.1.3. Increases which appear unreasonable , unjustified, or discriminatory (for example, an
         increase of 15%)
     3.10.2. Installations may also elect to report rate increases other than those they must report.
     3.10.3. Report other substantive utility issues that may affect mission accomplishment regardless of
     their immediate dollar value.
     3.10.4. To report electric, gas, water, and sewage disposal rate cases, telephone or mail the report to
     AFLSA/JACL (ULT). Use the telephone to avoid delay in getting the information to AFLSA/JACL
     (ULT). Use the format in paragraph 1.8.For follow-on reporting (under AFI 32-1061, Providing Util-
     ities To US Air Force Installations) of electric, gas, water, and sewage disposal rate cases, send infor-
     mation copies to MAJCOM SJA offices and the installation civil engineer. Installation and MAJCOM
     judge advocate representatives should ask their civil engineering counterparts to obtain copies of civil
     engineering rate increase reports for AFI 32-1061.
     3.10.5. To report telephone rate cases, telephone or mail the report to the appropriate installation
     communications officer and 38 EIW/JA, Tinker AFB, OK.
     3.10.6. The Utility Litigation Team, working with the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency, is
     the center of expertise for all utility matters, including utility rate interventions, utility privatization,
     and energy conservation. Judge advocates should contact the Utility Litigation Team in any action
     that may impact utility service to the installation.

Section 3F—Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) Litigation

3.11. General Information. In FOIA litigation, the Government has 30 days to answer a complaint, not
the normal 60-day period allowed for other litigation. (Note: Those unfamiliar with FOIA litigation
often incorrectly indicate the 60-day period on the summons.) Prompt reporting of both PA and FOIA
issues is imperative since a single complaint may include both.

3.12. Reporting Requirements. You must notify AFLSA/JACL by telephone on the duty day that you
receive a complaint. Immediately send the summons, complaint, and other available materials to AFLSA/
JACL by fax, express mail, or similar means pending the complete litigation report. Contact the appropri-
ate US Attorney’s office to verify the effective date of service and identify the Assistant US Attorney han-
dling the case.
     3.12.1. After making initial contact with AFLSA/JACL, send a formal litigation report that includes:
         3.12.1.1. A redacted and an unredacted copy of the records at issue in the litigation.
         3.12.1.2. A chronology reflecting the processing of the underlying FOIA/PA request.
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                           33


       3.12.1.3. The name, address, commercial, and DSN phone numbers of the responsible FOIA/PA
       officer.
   3.12.2. For Privacy Act lawsuits, the litigation report must include a statement indicating if the plain-
   tiff filed a request for amendment to the record. If such a request was filed, include a copy of the
   request and the agency's response.
   3.12.3. If the record includes photographs, send photographic prints rather than photocopies. Index
   and separately certify the redacted and unredacted records.
   3.12.4. The record custodian should use AF Form 44, Certificate of Records.

Section 3G—Tax Litigation

3.13. Tax Disputes.
   3.13.1. Whether in litigation or not, report all disputes about:
       3.13.1.1. The validity or refund of taxes against property belonging to the Air Force or its instru-
       mentalities.
       3.13.1.2. The validity or refund of taxes against property belonging to contractors who use the
       property to perform their work for the Air Force or its instrumentalities.
       3.13.1.3. Taxes imposed on Air Force personnel that raise issues under Section 574, Soldiers’ and
       Sailors’ Civil Relief Act (Title 50 Appendix, United States Code, Section 574).

   cases involving Government contractors, report disputes to SAF/GCQ. Use the format in paragraph
   1.8.
   3.13.3. Do not negotiate the Air Force's position on any tax dispute with officials of a political entity
   or state without prior authorization by AFLSA/JACL, or, in cases involving Government contractors,
   do not negotiate without prior authorization from SAF/GCQ.

Section 3H—Right To Financial Privacy Act Litigation

3.14. General Information. From time to time, the Air Force needs to seek information, for a legitimate
law enforcement purpose, contained in the records of a bank or other financial institution regarding an Air
Force employee or military member. When this happens, the Air Force and its subordinate organizations
are required to comply with the requirements of the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA), Title 12,
United States Code, Sections 3401-3422. The RFPA gives individual customers of financial institutions
certain rights to notice, to object to release, or to sue federal agencies for violations of the RFPA. Ques-
tions about how to comply with the requirements of the RFPA should be directed, via the organizational
SJA, to the IL Branch.

3.15. Reporting Requirements. Whenever the Air Force or subordinate organization is named in or a
party to litigation under the RFPA, the IL Branch should be notified by telephone as soon as possible,
preferably on the duty day you receive notice of such action. Also, you will need to provide AFLSA/
JACL, by fax, express mail, or similar means, pending a complete litigation report:
34                                                                  AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


     3.15.1. Copies of the summons, complaint, motion to quash, or other documentation filed with the
     court in the pending litigation;
     3.15.2. A copy of the customer authorization, subpoena, judicial order, formal written request, or
     other paperwork used by the Air Force to request the financial information or records in question;
     3.15.3. A copy of all notices provided to the Air Force member or employee whose records were
     sought;
     3.15.4. A copy of any motion to quash, application to enjoin, completed motion form, or other written
     customer objections filed in an attempt to prevent release of the financial information;
     3.15.5. A copy, if any, of all judicial orders or decisions already issued regarding release of the finan-
     cial information in question; and
     3.15.6. A copy of any released financial information that is the subject of the litigation.

Section 3I—Constitutional Torts and Personal Tort Suits Not Brought Under the Federal Tort Claims
Act

3.16. Reporting Requirements. Whenever litigation names individual defendants who were acting
within the scope of their employment, you must act quickly to process representation requests (see para-
graph 1.3.) and, when necessary, to effect removal to federal court.
     3.16.1. Notify AFLSA/JACL by telephone on the duty day that you receive notice of such action:
        3.16.1.1. Send the summons, complaint, and other available materials to AFLSA/JACL by fax,
        express mail, or similar means, pending the complete litigation report.
        3.16.1.2. Send all material received by each individual, including copies and the envelope.
        3.16.1.3. Make copies for the individual.
        3.16.1.4. Contact the US Attorney's office to verify the effective date of service and identify the
        Assistant US Attorney handling the case.
     3.16.2. Follow initial contacts with a complete litigation report. In unusual situations, after getting
     telephone approval by AFLSA/JACL, you may send a copy of the report directly to the Assistant US
     Attorney. Use the format in paragraph 1.8.
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                            35


Figure 3.1. Checklist Items for Preparation of an Administrative Record.

                CHECKLIST ITEMS FOR PREPARATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

1. Obtain ALL documentation related to the lawsuit.
2. Safeguard records of others (personnel records, IG Reports, promotion profiles) to prevent routine
retirement or destruction.
3. Keep the originals and make copies for the administrative record. Copies of two-sided documents
should be made single-sided.
4. Arrange documents into chronological order.
5. When practical, delete duplicates from the administrative record.
6. Bind records at top using Acco prong fasteners and pasteboard covers. Remember, this document will
likely be a court exhibit; professionalism counts!
7. Divide bulky records into volumes 1-1½ inches thick.
8. Prepare a master index and an index for each volume and insert behind the AF Form 44.
9. Paginate records at the lower right corner BEFORE making copies of the record. Continue numbering
consecutively in each volume (e.g., Vol. I—pages 1-100; Vol. II—pages 101-200; Vol. III—pages
201-266).
10. Reduce oversize pages to 8½” x 11”.
11. Have the appropriate records custodian certify the volumes on AF Forms 44. (See paragraph 8.3. for
information on procedures for the certification and authentication of records using the AF Form 44.)
12. Send one original AF Form 44 for each volume of the record. Attach each such form to the front of the
volume it is meant to authenticate.
13. Ensure that the description of the records on the AF Form 44 accurately describes the records (“This
is Volume II of III, pages 101-200”).
14. Do not fill in the bottom of the AF Form 44 or attach a seal—that will be accomplished at the Secre-
tary of the Air Force’s office.
15. Do not include any privileged material (including your litigation report) in the administrative record.
16. Retain a complete copy of the administrative record along with your litigation report to facilitate
future work on the case.
17. Send the original (the copy with the originally signed AF Form 44) and three copies of the administra-
tive record to JACL.
Final Points:
18. Keep the JACL action attorney advised of all local developments.
19. Remember that JACL is the focal point for all contact between the Air Force and the Assistant
US Attorney defending the case.

   4.1.5. Patent, Copyright and Trademark cases. See Chapter 7.

4.2. Reporting Requirements. Fax or telephone AFLSA/JACN immediately when you learn of contract
litigation involving or arising out of activities of the Air Force or its instrumentalities, whether or not the
Air Force is a party to the litigation. Follow the initial contact with a litigation report in accordance with
paragraph 1.8., unless AFLSA/JACN directs otherwise.
   4.2.1. Title 28, United States Code 520(b) gives the information requirements for suits brought in the
   US Court of Federal Claims or the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a contract, agree-
   ment, or transaction with any executive or military department. Make sure to fulfill these require-
   ments when handling such suits. If you have any questions about including particular information,
   contact AFLSA/JACN immediately. Note: You must adhere to AFLSA/JACN suspense dates to
   meet litigation deadlines imposed by court rules or DoJ direction.

4.3. Third Party Litigation. Contract litigation may require compliance with discovery requests for
actions in which the Air Force is not a named party, such as prime contractor or subcontractor suits. These
actions routinely seek information from the Air Force regarding an underlying contract.
   4.3.1. Unless it appears that this action might result in liability for the Air Force, you need not prepare
   a litigation report.
   4.3.2. Do notify AFLSA/JACN of these cases to ensure a consistent Air Force response.
   4.3.3. The SJA of the installation or unit or other individual responsible for litigation reporting must
   handle the subpoena or information request in accordance with DoD Directive 5405.2, Release of
   Official Information in Litigation and Testimony by DoD Personnel as Witnesses, and Chapter 9 of
   this instruction.

                    ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE LAW LITIGATION

5.1. Who Is Responsible . The Air Force Environmental Law and Litigation Division (AFLSA/JACE) is
primarily responsible for managing environmental and land use litigation involving the Department of the
Air Force. AFLSA/JACE works closely with DoJ and US Attorneys nationwide to deal with civil litiga-
tion concerning Air Force installations and various environmental protection statutes. AFLSA/JACE also
works closely with MAJCOM SJAs to deal with administrative litigation concerning Air Force installa-
tions and arising under the various environmental protection statutes. Installation SJAs must report all
actual or potential environmental or land use litigation to AFLSA/JACE, the appropriate MAJCOM SJA,
and the appropriate regional environmental counsel.

5.2. Reportable Environmental and Land Use Litigation . In addition to the reporting requirements
set forth in AFI 32-7047, Compliance Tracking And Reporting, reportable litigation includes, but is not
limited to:

        or control over Air Force property (see paragraph 5.5.)
        5.2.2.6. Any other litigation including quiet title and ejectment suits affecting Air Force real prop-
        erty interests. Report these actions informally through the MAJCOM SJA to AFLSA/JACE to
        determine if a substantive, formal litigation report is necessary.

5.3. Affirmative Litigation. Although the kinds of litigation in paragraph 5.2. are mainly defensive,
SJAs must report circumstances under which the Air Force may want to initiate litigation or join as an
intervenor or third party in litigation where the Air Force is not named as a party.
     5.3.1. Examples of civil cases would include:
        5.3.1.1. Proposals to establish landfills or waterfowl habitats near operational runways that might

5.4. Disputes of Environmental Fees (e.g. Fee/Tax) Issues. Generally, Air Force facilities are required
to pay environmental compliance and administrative fees. However, occasionally, such “fees” may in fact
be nonpayable taxes. When an SJA believes an environmental fee is not payable, the SJA should request
advice from AFLSA/JACE through the appropriate MAJCOM on whether or not the fee should be paid.
In general, an environmental fee is not payable when the fee is:
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                            41

5.5. Reporting Environmental Litigation. SJAs must immediately report by telephone or electronic
mail any actual or possible environmental or land use litigation (including, but not limited to, notices of
intent to sue, notices of violation or other adverse documentation that could be resolved administratively
by any federal, state or local environmental authority, and FOIA requests pertaining to environmental
matters.) If electronic mail is used for reporting, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure receipt.
   5.5.1. SJAs should report prospective litigation promptly, even if formal documentation, including,
   but not limited to, a complaint, process, or notice has not been received. Such reports should be made
   to AFLSA/JACE, the appropriate MAJCOM, and the appropriate regional environmental counsel.
   Typically, SJAs become aware of deficiencies that are likely to result in administrative action or liti-
   gation following inspections by state or local inspectors.
   5.5.2. Formal Litigation Reports.
       5.5.2.1. SJAs will prepare a formal litigation report in accordance with paragraph 1.8., when it
       appears AFLSA/JACE will have to defend Air Force interests in state or federal litigation or when
       otherwise directed by AFLSA/JACE.
       5.5.2.2. In addition to other materials required under paragraph 1.8., SJAs should be prepared to
       provide the following documentation, if relevant to the litigation:

           ment.
           5.5.2.2.5. One copy of any documents relating to consultations with other federal agencies
           (i.e., biological assessments and requests for consultation under the ESA).
           5.5.2.2.6. As many copies of all records pertaining to the litigation, such as correspondence,
           records, photography, or reports, as the particular case may require. AFLSA/JACE determines
           the quantity of such documents in each case.
           5.5.2.2.7. Electronic versions of the aforementioned documentation may be provided in lieu
           of paper documentation, unless otherwise directed by AFLSA/JACE. If electronic mail is used
           to deliver such documents, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure receipt.
   5.5.3. Other litigation reporting requirements.
42                                                                   AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


        5.5.3.1. Administrative actions. SJAs must report to AFLSA/JACE, the servicing MAJCOM, and
        the appropriate regional environmental counsel any time a federal, state or local regulatory author-
        ity seeks a fine or penalty for a violation of an environmental law. This will usually occur when
        the federal, state or local regulatory agency issues adverse documentation (including, but not lim-
        ited to, an NOV, NON or field citation) informing the Air Force installation a fine is a possible
        consequence for the resolution of the alleged violation set forth in the adverse documentation.
        5.5.3.2. Settlement of Administrative actions.
            5.5.3.2.1. AFLSA/JACE must give approval before settlement of any administrative action
            where the terms of the settlement include provisions for the payment of fines (this includes set-
            tlement agreements that accept terms for stipulated penalties or suspended fines) or supple-
            mental environmental projects (SEP).
            5.5.3.2.2. SJAs requesting authority to settle administrative actions should forward such
            requests through the MAJCOM SJA to AFLSA/JACE for approval.
        5.5.3.3. SJAs must report to AFLSA/JACE, the servicing MAJCOM, and the appropriate regional
        environmental counsel whenever a federal, state or local regulatory authority initiates criminal
        action against an Air Force member or employee. (NOTE: Special interest case reporting proce-
        dures to AFLSA/JAJM would also apply to these cases. See AFI 51-201, Administration of Mili-
        tary Justice, paragraph 12.8., especially subparagraph 12.8.2.3.)
     5.5.4. SJAs must report the actual payment of any fines or penalties paid under environmental stat-
     utes to AFLSA/JACE through the MAJCOM SJA within 30 days of payment to the appropriate fed-
     eral, state or local environmental authority.

5.6. Annexation Proposals.
     5.6.1. DoD Directive 4165.6, Real Property Acquisition, Management, And Disposal, September 1,
     1987, at paragraph (F)(2)(g), sets forth DoD policy on annexations of military installations by local
     communities or political entities. This directive states:

           “Annexation. It is DoD policy to be neutral relative to annexation by a municipality or political
           subdivision in accordance with State law, unless the Secretary of the Military Department
           concerned determines that such action would not be in the best interest of the Federal
           Government, or it is opposed by another local jurisdiction.”
     5.6.2. The installation SJA sends a report analyzing the potential impact of a proposed annexation
     that specifically addresses the impact of annexation on the right of the installation to contract for util-
     ity and waste disposal services to AFLSA/JACE and to AFLSA/JACL (ULT). If the right of the
     installation to contract for telephone services is impacted, a copy of the report should also be sent to
     38 EIW/JA, Tinker AFB, OK. [See paragraph 3.10.] Figure 5.1. outlines information that usually
     applies to annexation proceedings.

5.7. Rule-making Proceedings. Installation SJAs may submit comments on proposed state and local
rules after approval by the Division Chief, AFLSA/JACE. SJAs shall submit proposed comments to the
appropriate regional counsel office of AFLSA/JACE for obtaining such approval.

     6.2.3. Legal actions arising out of Air Force contracts, subcontracts and purchase orders, bankruptcy,
     receivership, assignment, and probate proceedings that affect the interests of the United States.
     6.2.3. (USAFE) This includes insolvency proceedings instituted by insolvent debtors to avert bank-
     ruptcy by accomplishment of a judicial composition of their creditors.

     eign government or agency that may affect the Air Force mission.
     6.2.5. Legal process of foreign courts affecting the Air Force or Air Force personnel in their official
     capacity.
     6.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Some legal actions not reportable above may nonetheless be of interest to the
     USAFE Staff Judge Advocate (HQ USAFE/JA). These cases include otherwise minor labor cases
     (including cases involving base maintenance contractors or their employees) which may be politically
     sensitive, and those that have unusual legal issues which are of special interest to the command.
     Whenever a staff judge advocate (SJA) has notice of a case not reportable under the basic regulation,
     the SJA will contact HQ USAFE/JAI by electronic mail (USAFE.JAI@ramstein.af.mil) or tele-
     phone (DSN 480-6593/6594). If HQ USAFE/JAI determines that the case should be monitored, the
     basic information will be taken by electronic mail, over the phone and/or faxed and a file started. This
     reporting requirement also includes administrative proceedings that may end up in court (e.g., fines,
     labor inspections, etc.).
     6.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Improper Service of Process. When service of process is attempted by deliv-
     ery of court papers to the commander, SJA, or in some other improper manner, the SJA should return
     such papers to the court or process server with a brief explanation of the proper method of service
     upon the US (see AFI 51-301, Figure 6., as a guide). Prior to returning the court papers, the SJA
     should photocopy the documents. Mail copies to International Law (HQ USAFE/JAI), Unit 3050 Box
     100, APO AE 09094-0100. If the documents are not in English, include a translation. Coordinate the
     letter returning the court papers with HQ USAFE/JAI, DoJ and DoJ local counsel, if appropriate.

     member,” for purposes of this publication only, include local wage rate (LWR) and local nation (LN)
     personnel.

6.3. Reporting Methods.
     6.3.1. Electronic Reporting. The reporting authority submits an initial message, datafax or electronic
     mail to HQ USAF/JAI, with an information copy to the MAJCOM, immediately on receiving notice
     of the start of a foreign suit, action, or proceeding that requires reporting. (See paragraph 6.2.) If
     datafax or electronic mail is used, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure its receipt. This initial
     report precedes the formal litigation report (see paragraph 1.8.) and explains the subject of the action.
     Both reports should be identified as attorney work product. For the European theater, HQ USAFE/JA
     is responsible for advising DoJ’s European Office of all initiated suits.
     6.3.1. (USAFE) Immediately contact HQ USAFE/JAI by telephone whenever litigation or an admin-
     istrative proceeding concerning an organization or individual of this command requires action.

48                                                                  AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


     tion by the LN staff attorney regarding the selection of the DoJ-retained counsel is strongly encour-
     aged.
     6.4.4. (Added-USAFE) In a suit or other proceeding brought in a foreign country, include specific
     information on the possibility of any counterclaims under the procedural rules of the foreign country
     involved, and data on the financial status of prospective local defendants where such information is
     readily available from the nearest United States foreign service post (embassy or consulate) in the
     country involved, or other US Government agency.
     6.4.5. (Added-USAFE) If the litigation or proceeding is pre-contractual or relates to pre-contractual
     matters, include copies of the relevant Request for Proposal (RFP) and file documentation or corre-
     spondence relating to the subject matter of the litigation. If the litigation or proceeding is filed after

     6.5.2. Send HQ USAF/JAI two copies of all pertinent correspondence and documents.
     6.5.3. Send information copies to the MAJCOM/JA and NAF/JA (see paragraph 6.3.)

6.6. Commencement of Proceedings.
     6.6.1. Foreign Jurisdiction. The defense of sovereign immunity or a lack of jurisdiction of a foreign
     court may be proper only when the United States or one of its agencies or instrumentalities is a named
     party defendant, and in such event may be asserted only with the prior approval of DoJ and TJAG.
     6.6.2. Suits Against the United States. Send to the SJA any writ, summons, notice of legal proceed-
     ings, or other foreign civil process delivered to an Air Force officer, employee, or activity immedi-
     ately on receipt.
        6.6.2.1. The SJA then returns the document to the issuing authority, with a suitable statement
        respectfully and tactfully explaining the lack of authority of the person or activity to accept service
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                        49


     on behalf of the United States, and suggesting that service or delivery be made on the US Embassy
     through established channels, or on the Department of Justice, Washington, DC, under the 1965
     Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
     Commercial Matters. Their address is Office of International Judicial Assistance, Civil Division,
     Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. SJAs should also forward courtesy copies of these
     documents, including their written statement, to this DoJ office.
     6.6.2.2. No exceptions to this procedure exist except with prior approval from TJAG and DoJ,
     and clearance from the chief of the US diplomatic mission in the country. (See Figure 6.1. for a
     model letter returning such a process).
     6.6.2.3. Refer questions concerning this policy to HQ USAF/JAI.
  6.6.3. Suits Against United States Government Agencies and Instrumentalities.
     6.6.3.1. United States Government agencies and instrumentalities in foreign countries, such as
     military units and installations, installation exchanges, open messes, and military missions, lack
     juridical personality under United States law. Such government activities of the United States gen-
     erally are not subject to civil proceedings or service of process in foreign countries. Claims nomi-
     nally against such activities are in law suits against the United States.
     6.6.3.2. Except for proceedings against US personnel arising outside of performance of official
     duties, the United States is the only proper party defendant or respondent in any foreign civil pro-
     ceedings.
     6.6.3.3. The US embassy in that country is the only United States activity that may receive and
     accept service of foreign process.
     6.6.3.4. In suits against United States Government agencies and instrumentalities, the SJA returns
     the foreign process to the issuing authority with a suitable statement respectfully and tactfully
     explaining the lack of juridical personality on the part of the United States Government agency or
     instrumentality involved. (See Figure 6.1. for model letter returning process).
     6.6.3.5. (Added-USAFE) Procedures for Italy:
         6.6.3.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Under Italian law, the plaintiff must first attempt a conciliation
         proceeding before the Province Labor Directorate and only if this attempt fails, he/she may
         start a lawsuit in court. DoJ’s position is that nobody should appear for the mandatory attempt
         of conciliation, unless the Service concerned wants to settle the case.
            6.6.3.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) In such case, the cognizant local SJA must send a proposal
            to DoJ with indication of who will pay for the settlement, if any payment will have to be
            made. This proposal must be forwarded to DoJ through HQ USAFE/JAI for HQ USAFE/
            JAI final recommendation. DoJ will give power of attorney to a person appointed by HQ
            USAFE/JAI to represent the US Government in the settlement proceedings and sign the
            settlement documents.
            6.6.3.5.1.2. (Added-USAFE) If the attempt of conciliation has already taken place with
            no appearance of the US Government but it is deemed that it would be in the best interest
            of the US Government to negotiate a settlement with the plaintiff before the commence-
            ment of the case in court, the cognizant local SJA must follow the same procedure outlined
50                                                                  AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


                under paragraph 6.6.3.5.1.1. (Added) above. The settlement will be done on condition
                that the plaintiff abandons the lawsuit.
            6.6.3.5.2. (Added-USAFE) DoJ normally requests the Service position on proposals for court
            settlements that may be made at any stage of the lawsuit. DoJ should request HQ USAFE/
            JAI’s position on Air Force cases. HQ USAFE/JAI will draft the Air Force position after con-
            sulting with the cognizant local SJA if necessary. HQ USAFE/JAI recommendation will
            include a statement on availability of Air Force funds for payment of the settlement.
            6.6.3.5.3. (Added-USAFE) DoJ normally requests the Service position on the opportunity to
            continue a case with an appeal. DoJ should request HQ USAFE/JAI’s position on Air Force
            cases. HQ USAFE/JAI will draft the Air Force position after consulting with the cognizant
            local SJA if necessary.
     6.6.4. Suits Against Individuals Acting in an Official Capacity.
        6.6.4.1. These guidelines apply to civil suits, actions, and proceedings in foreign countries against
        individual members or employees of the Air Force for acts or omissions arising out of the perfor-
        mance of their official duties.
            6.6.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) In North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations, pursuant
            to paragraph 8, Article VIII, NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), if a dispute arises
            over whether a tortious act or omission of a member of a force, or civilian component was
            done in the performance of official duty, the question, upon concurrence of HQ USAFE/JA,
            may be submitted to an arbitrator appointed according to paragraph 2(b), Article VIII. The
            arbitrator’s decision is final and conclusive.
        6.6.4.2. The guidelines on returning process to issuing authorities do not apply if TJAG decides
        that applying them is inconsistent with pertinent provisions of a status of forces or similar agree-
        ment, or that applying them may adversely affect the defense of such suits in that country.
        6.6.4.3. When a process on its face establishes that the act or omission complained of is patently
        a governmental act:
            6.6.4.3.1. Return it to the issuing authorities with a letter signed by the SJA explaining that the
            act or omission complained of was performed by the subject while acting as an official of the
            Air Force or an agency of the United States Government, and in the performance of official
            duties under superior orders.
                6.6.4.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Handle in an analogous manner proceedings similar to gar-
                nishment and attachment (such as those involving court orders in receivership cases, bank-
                ruptcy, and insolvency proceedings that require payment to a court-appointed
                administrator). This includes US deposits in escrow with local courts of money owed to an
                unknown clainant or competing claimants. In case of garnishment or attachment of mon-
                ies due LWR personnel employed by the receiving state and serving the US Forces (indi-
                rect hire system), the proper garnishee is the employing receiving state (in Germany,
                Defense Cost Office; in most other countries, the Ministry of Finance).
            6.6.4.3.2. Further state that in legal effect the subject is not the proper party defendant. The
            letter should not contain any express statement that suit should be brought against the United
            States, as this is an improper invitation of suits against the United States.
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                        51


     6.6.4.4. When a process does not on its face establish that the act was governmental:
         6.6.4.4.1. Return it with a similar letter of explanation to that described above.
         6.6.4.4.2. Attach a certified statement from the member’s immediate commander attesting to
         the employment or military status of the individual and indicating that the individual was per-
         forming official duties at the time and place when the alleged act occurred.
         6.6.4.4.3. If the issuing authority rejects the return of process:
             6.6.4.4.3.1. Allow the service of the process according to applicable international agree-
             ment and local law and procedures.
                6.6.4.4.3.1.1. If proper service is obtained, the defendant must defend the suit, and the
                defendant must prove during the trial that the occurrence was part of his or her official
                duties.
  6.6.5. Garnishment and Attachment Proceedings. As a general rule, the United States and its agencies
  and instrumentalities are not subject to garnishment orders or money attachment proceedings in for-
  eign countries aimed at wages or other funds due and payable by the United States to alleged or adju-
  dicated debtors of the parties on whose behalf garnishment or attachment is attempted.
     6.6.5.1. An exception to this rule exists in the Federal Republic of Germany. Under Article 34(3),
     German Supplementary Agreement to the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, the United States
     must (see Public Law 93-647, Social Services Amendments of 1974, January 4, 1975) honor writs
     of garnishment issued by German courts against members of US forces or civilian component sta-
     tioned in the Federal Republic of Germany for child support or alimony obligations. Consult the
     DoD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual, paragraph 70710.
     6.6.5.1. (USAFE) Procedures for Germany:
         6.6.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The USAFE Special Assistant for NATO Legal Affairs (HQ
         USAFE/JAS) forwards the following documentation to Director, Defense Financial and
         Accounting Service (DFAS)-Cleveland Center, Garnishment Operations Directorate
         (DFAS-CL/L), P.O. Box 998002, Cleveland, Ohio 44199-8002. In all cases of garnishment of
         military members for child and spousal support arising in the Federal Republic of Germany.

             6.6.5.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Certification that the process is legally sufficient. Such cer-
             tification shall include, but not to be limited to, a determination that:
                6.6.5.1.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The writ complies with German law.
                6.6.5.1.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The member was served notice of the prior German
                court proceeding which resulted in an order obligating the member to pay the child
                support or alimony, and.
                6.6.5.1.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) The certification of service of this notice was issued
                as provided in Article 32 of the German Supplementary Agreement.
             6.6.5.1.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Exact name and address of the garnishment recipient.
             Additionally, send a copy of the writ and its English translation, together with an explana-
             tory letter to the garnishee (courtesy copy to DFAS), to the cognizant local SJA for service
             on the garnishee.

                6.6.5.1.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) In cases of appropriated fund civilian employees sta-
                tioned in Germany, HQ USAFE/JAS forwards the writ of garnishment to Director,
                DFAS-Charleston Operating Location, P.O. Box 118056, Charleston, SC 29423-8056,
                with information copy to DFAS Center at Cleveland, Ohio, including the same infor-
                mation required for military garnishees described in paragraph 6.6.5.1.1. (Added).
                DFAS provides the appropriate Civilian Payroll Office with necessary instructions for
                pay withholding and for mailing payments to the appropriate addressee.
                6.6.5.1.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) In cases of non-appropriated fund civilian employees,
                HQ USAFE/JAI forwards the writ of garnishment to HQ AFSVA/SVX, 10100
                Reunion Place, Suite 503, San Antonio, Texas 78216-4138, including the same infor-
                mation required for military garnishees described in paragraph 6.6.5.1.1. (Added). An
                information copy is sent to the applicable servicing base legal non-appropriated fund
                financial management office (NAFFMO). Contact Resource Management Division
                (HQ USAFE/A7VF), DSN 496-6202 to obtain the identity (Non-appropriated Funds
                Instrumentality (NAFI) number) of the applicable NAFFMO and provide the NAFI
                number to HQ AFSVA/SVXCC. HQ AFSVA provides the NAFFMO with instruc-
                tions for pay withholding and for mailing payments to the appropriate addressee.
                6.6.5.1.1.3.3. (Added-USAFE) In cases of Army and Air Force Exchange Service
                (AAFES) employees, HQ USAFE/JAS refers the writ of garnishment to General
                Counsel, Army and Air Force Exchange Service Europe, Unit 24580, APO AE 09245,
                requesting AAFES to notify the court in writing that service has been made. Provide
                HQ USAFE/JAS with an info copy.
                6.6.5.1.1.3.4. (Added-USAFE) In all of the foregoing instances, serve the writ of gar-
                nishment upon the garnishee and furnish the German court issuing the writ with the
                required USAFE Form 170, Certificate of Service - Zustellungsnachweis. Also, pro-
                vide the German court with a courtesy copy of the HQ USAFE/JAS letter, forwarding
                the garnishment order to the appropriate payroll office. In cases of AAFES employees,
                notify court of referral.
     6.6.5.2. In all other cases, the United States cannot honor garnishment orders or money attach-
     ments. You may cooperate with the foreign judicial and administrative authorities and advise of
     the date, time, and place of payment to the debtor. The creditor can exercise legal rights directly
     against the debtor without submitting the United States or its activities to the jurisdiction of the
     foreign court or agency. Upon receipt of any writ, order, or petition for garnishment or money
     attachment served on, or otherwise delivered to an Air Force officer, employee, or activity, refer
     such document to the SJA.
     6.6.5.3. If the United States cannot honor the garnishment or money attachment request, per para-
     graph 6.6.5.2., the SJA returns it to the issuing authority.
        6.6.5.3.1. The SJA advises the foreign court or other agency that the US military authorities
        will cooperate with the local authorities to allow the creditor to pursue remedies under local
        law directly against the debtor. (See Figure 6.1. for a model letter.)
        6.6.5.3.2. If the debtor is a United States citizen or resident alien, release only information
        authorized under the Privacy Act (see AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program).
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                          53


         6.6.5.3.3. Send full electronic report of each case immediately to the NAF/JA, MAJCOM/JA,
         and HQ USAF/JAI.
     6.6.5.4. If the United States can honor the garnishment or money attachment request, per para-
     graph 6.6.5.1., the MAJCOM SJA will implement procedures for processing such requests. Send
     a full report of each case immediately to the NAF/JA, MAJCOM/JA, and HQ USAF/JAI.
  6.6.6. (Added-USAFE) Suits Against or by Individuals in a Private Capacity:
     6.6.6.1. (Added-USAFE) The Liaison Agency (HQ USAFE/JAS) handles documents in
     non-criminal matters issued by German civil courts of authorities pertaining to members of the US
     Air Forces, its civilian component and their dependents stationed in Germany. [See Article 32,
     FRG Supplementary Agreement to the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SA)]. HQ USAFE/
     JAS may either be requested by German courts or authorities to serve these documents upon the
     members concerned or shall be notified by the German courts or authorities if they intend to serve
     documents directly (through the German system) upon members concerned.
     6.6.6.2. (Added-USAFE) In cases where HQ USAFE/JAS receives requests for service of pro-
     cess, documents are forwarded to the SJA servicing the organization of the member or dependent
     concerned. The document must be served on the member within 21 days of the date of the
     USAFE/JAS letter of transmittal. German authorities will be notified of the service using USAFE
     Form 170. Prepare this form in three copies. The servicing SJA forwards the original to the cog-
     nizant court, sends a copy to HQ USAFE/JAS, Unit 3050 Box 100, APO AE 09094-0100, and
     retains a copy. In cases where service of process cannot be effected prior to the expiration of 21
     days, an interim reply to the German court or authority is required, according to Art 32(1)(c)(i) of
     the SA. If the member has been transferred to or placed on temporary duty with another unit
     within Germany, or is hospitalized in Germany, contact HQ USAFE/JAS for further instructions.
     In the case of a member or dependent transferred to a location outside of Germany, the SJA returns
     the process and related correspondence to the German court or authority, with an information copy
     to HQ USAFE/JAS.
         6.6.6.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Release of Information for the Purpose of Locating Individuals.
         In order for the SJA and legal office staff to locate and notify individuals of pending court doc-
         uments, it is necessary to obtain the assistance of agencies such as the Military Post Office,
         Military Housing Office, Military and Civilian Personnel Offices, Vehicle Registration, or
         other offices where pertinent records are kept.
            6.6.6.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Release of information to legal office staff having a need
            for the record in the performance of their duties relevant to this publication is authorized
            without obtaining prior consent. Do not release information obtained by legal office per-
            sonnel from other military agencies to German authorities. Use such information solely
            for identification purposes.
     6.6.6.3. (Added-USAFE) Upon receipt of notification from a German court or authority that a
     document will be served directly through the German system (German mail), HQ USAFE/JAS
     will notify the member concerned by the most effective means (e.g., military members through
     their commanders), and instruct that person to take the documents served upon him or her to the
     servicing base legal office to have it explained and seek legal assistance to avoid negative conse-
     quences.
54                                                                 AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


        6.6.6.4. (Added-USAFE) Make USAFE Form 177, Objection to Payment Order, available for
        the convenience of members. The form (in both English and German languages) applies only to
        writs of payment and may not be used to file an objection against any other order or instrument by
        a German court or authority. When used, prepare the form in three copies. Forward the original
        and one copy to the cognizant court; the individual retains the remaining copy. The local SJA
        does not retain a copy.
        6.6.6.5. (Added-USAFE) Air Force personnel who serve process will ensure that recipients
        understand the meaning and effect of the document served, as well as their rights and responsibil-
        ities in connection therewith. If Air Force personnel making service are not judge advocates,
        civilian attorneys or other persons capable of adequately explaining the document involved to the
        recipient, refer the individual being served to the SJA for this advice.

6.7. Defending Against Foreign Suits and Proceedings.
     6.7.1. DoJ prosecutes and defends in all foreign courts all civil suits by or against the United States,
     US agencies, US instrumentalities, or officials and employees whose official conduct is involved. The
     information contained in reports made under this chapter constitutes the basis for a report by HQ
     USAF to DoJ and for an Air Force recommendation to that Department as to the action to be taken in
     the case. DoJ, in turn, takes action to ensure that steps are taken to institute or defend the suit.
     6.7.2. United States Government Representation of an Individual. DoJ represents military personnel
     and civilian employees of the Air Force being sued in foreign courts because of actions they took in
     the line of duty in the performance of their official duties.
        6.7.2.1. DoJ decides for each case if it will provide representation or permit the Air Force to do
        so.
        6.7.2.2. Submit requests for United States Government representation in foreign courts (see para-
        graph 1.3.) in writing through HQ USAF/JAI.
        6.7.2.3. The United States Government does not pay for private counsel that individuals hire
        without specific authorization and will not pay any judgment against the individual (see para-
        graphs 1.3.and 1.4.).
     6.7.3. United States Government Representation of an Air Force Contractor. If an Air Force contrac-
     tor requests United States Government representation before a foreign civil court, contact HQ USAF/
     JAI for guidance and follow the procedures in paragraph 1.3.
     6.7.4. Obtaining a Continuance. If the date set for a hearing does not allow enough time to retain
     United States Government counsel, the SJA, in consultation with DoJ, may be instructed to attempt to
     get a continuance.
        6.7.4.1. In attempting to obtain such continuance, the SJA does not appear in court or do anything
        else that can be construed as a defense or a legal appearance.
        6.7.4.2. Advise HQ USAF/JAI electronically of all such attempts.
     6.7.5. Cooperating with Foreign Counsel. SJAs will give information and evidence to foreign counsel
     that DoJ retains to represent US interests.
     6.7.6. Communicating with DoJ. DoJ retains, instructs, and pays foreign counsel.
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                           55


      6.7.6.1. The retained counsel keeps in touch with DoJ.
      6.7.6.2. SJAs are encouraged, as the need arises, to communicate directly with DoJ and, where
      necessary, their retained counsel. Back brief NAF/JA and MAJCOM/JA, as appropriate.
   6.7.7. Handling Administrative Legal Problems in Civil Litigation. Do not consult with foreign coun-
   sel retained by DoJ on administrative legal problems collateral to the civil litigation. When the local
   SJA cannot resolve such problems, refer them to the next higher command.

6.8. Suing in a Foreign Court.
   6.8.1. The United States may:
      6.8.1.1. Sue for money damages.
      6.8.1.2. Petition for injunctive relief.
      6.8.1.3. Sue for the return of personal or real property.
      6.8.1.4. Sue for the specific performance of a contract.
   6.8.2. DoJ prosecutes civil suits for the United States. The DoJ will:
      6.8.2.1. Quickly identify the basis for any legal action.
      6.8.2.2. Notify HQ USAF/JAI promptly.
   6.8.3. If a contractor is facing criminal proceedings based on an activity or transaction for which the
   United States may sue in civil court, the SJA shall notify HQ USAF/JAI immediately. When such
   action serves the interest of the United States, DoJ can intervene as a complainant in the criminal case.
   6.8.4. After you identify a wrong and deem action proper, the SJA shall alert DoJ immediately by
   message to HQ USAF/JAI. Include:
      6.8.4.1. A description of the facts of the case.
      6.8.4.2. A discussion of the local law that applies to the dispute.
      6.8.4.3. An analysis of why a suit is appropriate.
      6.8.4.4. Date at which the applicable statute of limitations will run.
      6.8.4.5. Amount of claim or relief sought.
      6.8.4.6. Nature of anticipated defenses or counterclaims.
      6.8.4.7. Other interested parties or possible intervenors.
      6.8.4.8. Efforts made to collect the debt or seek other relief before filing suit.
      6.8.4.9. Recommendation for selection of local counsel, with cost and fee estimate.
      6.8.4.10. Statement of availability of witnesses and evidence.
56                                                                 AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006

ment and Attachment Proceedings.
FORMAT FOR LETTER RETURNING FOREIGN PROCESS AND TENDERING ASSIS-
TANCE IN GARNISHMENT AND ATTACHMENT PROCEEDINGS
SUBJECT: (Identification of process)
TO: (Court or other authority from which process issued)
     1. Enclosed is the (identification of process) which was delivered by (mode of delivery, for example,
        mail or personal tender) to (individual or unit by which process was received) at (place of deliv-
        ery) on (date of delivery).
     2. Under the law of the United States, the (unit or activity to which process is directed) is a govern-
        ment agency or instrumentality that possesses no independent juridical personality, and thus is not
        itself amenable to civil process. The claim asserted in the present proceeding is a claim against the
        United States, and the only agency empowered to receive service of foreign process in such cases
        is the United States Embassy or Diplomatic Mission within the country concerned. Usually, ser-
        vice of process upon the Embassy or Diplomatic Mission is accomplished through diplomatic
        channels. Alternatively, service may also be possible on the United States Department of Justice,
        Washington D.C., under the 1965 Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
        Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters. Their address is Office of International
        Judicial Assistance, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530.
     3. Although circumstances outlined above require the return of this (identification of process), and
        without prejudice to the immunities enjoyed by the United States as sovereign, I can furnish you
        the date, time, and place of payments to be made to the debtor so that the creditor may pursue
        remedies under local law directly against the debtor. In this regard, the sum of (amount of pay-
        ment, expressed in local currency) will be paid to (name of debtor) at (place of payment) on (date
        of payment) at (time of payment). (If the debtor is an employee, include statement of future pay-
        ment schedule.)

      AUTHENTICATING OFFICIAL AIR FORCE RECORDS FOR ADMISSION INTO
                                EVIDENCE

8.1. Terms.
   8.1.1. Official Air Force Records. All documents, records, or papers which are required by the
   Department of the Air Force to be prepared or processed and retained.
   8.1.2. Custodian. A person in charge of an office in which official Air Force records are filed by law,
   regulation, or custom, or a person whom proper authority so designates; and for certain purposes, a
   person who has physical possession of official Air Force records for use in official duties.

8.2. Rules of Evidence. The rules of evidence at common law and various statutes specify how to
authenticate documents and records for use as evidence. Methods include:
   8.2.1. Oral testimony.
   8.2.2. Authenticated copies of public records.
   8.2.3. Other authorized methods. The method of authenticating official Air Force records specified in
   this chapter does not prevent proof of genuineness by any other authorized method.

8.3. Authenticating Official Records. Custodians must authenticate official Air Force records.
   8.3.1. Civilian Judicial or Quasi-Judicial Proceedings:
       8.3.1.1. An official Air Force record or an entry in it may be evidenced by an official publication
       thereof in the Federal Register, or the record custodian may authenticate a copy and certify that he
       or she has lawful custody of that record.
          8.3.1.1.1. Use AF Form 44 to authenticate official Air Force records and copies or extracts
          from them.
          8.3.1.1.2. Prepare the first certificate (the top part of AF Form 44) and forward it to the HQ
          USAF or AFLSA division handling the case together with the documents being authenticated.
          (See Figure 8.1.)
          8.3.1.1.3. Submit only the copies that have been requested for certification.
       8.3.1.2. Charge individuals requesting documents who are not from federal agencies for:
          8.3.1.2.1. Search time.
          8.3.1.2.2. Document reproduction.
          8.3.1.2.3. Certifying and validating the document.
       8.3.1.3. Send a letter to the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI indicat-
       ing that you:
          8.3.1.3.1. Billed the requester, and
          8.3.1.3.2. For records subject to the Privacy Act, that you worked within its guidelines, with a
          description of your reasons for releasing the records.
60                                                                     AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


         8.3.1.4. The Secretary of the Air Force or designee signs under the second certificate (the bottom
         part of the form) and affixes the Air Force seal to the AF Form 44. This procedure satisfies FRCP,
         Rule 44, for admitting official Air Force records as evidence and usually satisfies state jurisdiction
         requirements too.
     8.3.2. Getting Assistance from the SJA. Custodians of official Air Force records should consult their
     SJA or the responsible AFLSA/JAC litigation division on preparing AF Form 44.
     8.3.3. Voluminous Records. Divide voluminous records at logical points and put a covering AF Form
     44 on each section. Unless otherwise specified by court rules, each section should be no more than
     1½” thick.
     8.3.4. Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, and Chapter 9. When releasing official Air Force
     records to other than federal agencies, ensure the material is releasable under the Freedom of Informa-
     tion Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, that the privacy of individuals, under the requirements of the Privacy Act, 5
     U.S.C. 552a, has been satisfied, and Chapter 9 of this instruction has been followed. When respond-
     ing to requests from other non-DoD federal agencies, comply with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
     and systems notices made pursuant to the Privacy Act.

8.4. Offering Records into Evidence.
     8.4.1. Do not offer official Air Force records physically into evidence unless they can be withdrawn
     and a copy substituted for the original. Copies of Air Force records, authenticated as provided in this
     chapter, are usually admissible in evidence instead of the actual records.
     8.4.2. If the custodian of official Air Force records certifies that after diligent search no record or
     entry of a specified matter exists in the records of his or her office, that certificate is admissible as evi-
     dence of such fact.
         8.4.2.1. See Figure 8.2. for instructions and exact wording to use when you cannot find records.
         8.4.2.2. Forward AF Form 44 for completion.

  definition. Generally, official information includes, but is not limited to:
      9.2.6.1. Classified information of any kind;
      9.2.6.2. Paper, photographic or computer records about the acquisition, construction, operation,

Section 9B—Release of Official Information

9.3. Release Authorities for Official Information. The following personnel are the release authorities
for official Air Force information in the following litigation situations:
     9.3.1. SJAs are the release authorities for official, unclassified factual information in private litigation
     cases. In lieu of an available SJA, Secretariat personnel should consult with SAF/GC.
     9.3.2. Likewise, Medical Law Consultants (MLCs) are the release authorities for official, unclassi-
     fied factual information in private litigation, to the extent it involves the release of medical and other
     records and information within the custody, control or knowledge of their permanent station hospital
     and its personnel.
     9.3.3. For official information to be used in litigation before the Armed Services Board of Contract
     Appeals, contracting officers, in consultation with the appropriate servicing SJA, are authorized to
     release such information per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subpart 5.4., and applicable
     DoD directives and Air Force instructions. Responses to such requests must be coordinated with the
     assigned trial attorney at the AFMC LO/JAB, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5000.
     9.3.4. The responsible AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI (for official information to
     be released to, or used in, foreign courts) releases all official, unclassified Air Force information in
     cases in which the United States is a party or has a direct or indirect interest; they also make all such
     release decisions for cases in which the information could be used in a claim or litigation against the
     United States.

9.4. Applicability to Former and Retired Air Force Personnel. Former and retired Air Force person-
nel who have possession of or access to official Air Force information, including classified information,
are also required to follow the procedures in this section to obtain permission from the Air Force to
release such information.

9.5. Factors in Releasing Official Information or Testimony. Release authorities ensure requesters
state in writing the nature and relevance of the official information they want and include as much detail
as possible. The appropriate release authority then uses this information to evaluate the request in light of
DoDD 5405.2 (32 C.F.R., Part 97) and United States, ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). Before
releasing official information, release authorities consider these questions:
     9.5.1. Is the demand or request unduly burdensome or otherwise irrelevant?
     9.5.2. Does the demand or request specify remedial information that is inadmissible under the rules of
     evidence, or is the information otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules?
     9.5.3. Would disclosing this information (including release in camera) be appropriate under the rules
     of procedure governing the case and under the relevant substantive law concerning the appropriate
     privilege?
     9.5.4. Would disclosing the information violate any statute, executive order, regulation, or directive?
     Release documents subject to the Privacy Act only with consent of the individual or under a court
     order or subpoena specifically signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. Because an
     order against the United States is an order against the sovereign, what is considered to be a court of
     competent jurisdiction under the Privacy Act is subject to interpretation. [See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11);
     Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir 1985); Bosaw v. NTEU, 887 F. Supp. 1199 (S.D. Ind. 1995);
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                            67


   and Boron Oil Co. v. Downie, 873 F. 2d 67 (4th Cir. 1989).] Please refer any questions to the appropri-
   ate civil litigation division.
   9.5.5. Would disclosing the information, except in camera to assert a claim of privilege, reveal classi-
   fied or other restricted information? Particularly, would it reveal:
       9.5.5.1. Data under DoD 5200-1-R, Information Security Program, January 1997 or AFI 31-401,
       Information Security Program Management?
       9.5.5.2. Unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to DoD Directive
       5230.25, Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data From Public Disclosure, November 6, 1984
       (including Change 1, August 18, 1995)?
       9.5.5.3. Privileged safety information or documents contained in safety investigation board (SIB)
       reports conducted under AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations And Reports, and restricted from pub-
       lic release by DoD Instruction 6055.7, Accident Investigation, Reporting and Recordkeeping,
       October 3, 2000?
       9.5.5.4. Other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure?
   9.5.6. Would disclosure interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional
   rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or
   similarly confidential commercial or financial information, or otherwise be inappropriate under the
   circumstances?

9.6. Classified Information. No one, including release authorities, shall release classified official infor-
mation to courts or unauthorized persons under any circumstances, unless proper authority first declassi-
fies the material.
   9.6.1. When requesters ask for classified information that classification authorities cannot declassify
   at lower levels, Air Force personnel, through their SJAs, shall notify the appropriate civil litigation
   division of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI (if a foreign court is involved).
   9.6.2. Pending a final decision, the servicing SJA (or SAF/GC) shall ensure the requester, court, or
   other authority is furnished with a copy of Title 32, C.F.R., Part 97 (DoD Directive 5405.2) and this
   chapter and shall inform the requester that the request is under review. If necessary, SJAs will work to
   obtain a stay of the request or demand pending a final determination.

9.7. Defending Denials. For decisions denying official information within the authority of SJAs, SJAs
are authorized to consult directly with local United States attorneys or DoJ litigation attorneys to defend
such decisions from subpoenas, court orders, or other legal challenges before local, state or federal courts,
administrative bodies or other tribunals. Before any such consultation, however, SJAs are first required to
notify the appropriate civil litigation division of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI of the need to consult, provid-
ing a brief factual background of the case and giving the reasons for such consultation.

9.8. Releasing Official Information to DoJ. DoJ and its US Attorneys represent the government's inter-
est in judicial proceedings involving the Air Force.
   9.8.1. SJAs may release unclassified official information that is not privileged to DoJ or the US
   Attorney on request.
68                                                                  AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


     9.8.2. SJAs must send DOJ or US Attorney requests for classified information that cannot be declas-
     sified at lower levels, or for other privileged official information, to the responsible AFLSA civil liti-
     gation division or HQ USAF/JAI for a decision.

9.9. Fees. Persons releasing copies of records and other documentary material collect fees from the
requester according to the fee schedule in Chapter 6 of DoD 5400.7-R/AF Supplement, DOD Freedom of
Information Act Program, or 32 C.F.R. 97. 6(d).

9.10. Sending Requests. When an SJA requests a decision on releasing official information from an
AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI, he or she should provide the following information:
     9.10.1. Name of litigation and parties.
     9.10.2. Name and location of the court or tribunal.
     9.10.3. Date the litigation began and date of requested appearance.
     9.10.4. Name and address of requester and of party who has the requested official information.
     9.10.5. Type of action, subject matter, and a statement of the relevancy of the requested information.
     9.10.6. Copies of documents requested, or a complete description of them if they are bulky or numer-
     ous.
     9.10.7. Recommendations on release and any other pertinent information.

9.11. Complying With Subpoenas.
     9.11.1. SJAs give legal advice to Air Force personnel under subpoena to appear and testify concern-
     ing official information.
        9.11.1.1. When the proper release authority prohibits releasing the subpoenaed information, and
        the information does not include Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) material, the person receiving the
        subpoena, with the assistance of the appropriate legal office, attempts to resolve the matter with
        the attorney requesting the information or issuing the subpoena, or appears and explains the matter
        to the court. When Privacy Act material is involved, the SJA's office should assist the subpoenaed
        person to:
            9.11.1.1.1. Determine if a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction personally issued the sub-
            poena; and
            9.11.1.1.2. Make or negotiate an adequate response, or appear before the court, as appropri-
            ate.
            9.11.1.1.3. Where another release authority has been involved, SJAs should also consult with
            that authority, as necessary or appropriate.
        9.11.1.2. If the court or requesting attorney is not satisfied and persists in requesting the informa-
        tion, the witness respectfully asks for time to send the request to the appropriate AFLSA civil liti-
        gation division or HQ USAF/JAI for a final Air Force decision and possible assistance from DoJ.
        9.11.1.3. Judge advocates may accompany and advise the witness concerning a problem on
        release of official information.
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                             69


   9.11.2. When a subpoena calls for classified or otherwise unreleasable information outside of their
   release authority, SJAs, after the approval of the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ
   USAF/JAI, may:
       9.11.2.1. Communicate with the counsel requesting the subpoena.
       9.11.2.2. Explain the restrictions on release.
       9.11.2.3. Give the attorney releasable information.
       9.11.2.4. Suggest withdrawing the subpoena.
   9.11.3. Promptly report any subpoenas from foreign courts requiring records, files, or documents to
   HQ USAF/JAI.

9.12. Authenticating Documents. Authenticate official Air Force documents for civil litigation, rather
than requiring the custodian to personally appear and testify. The authentication procedure in Chapter 8
meets the requirements of federal courts and of most state courts and administrative bodies. Use the sim-
plest authentication procedure permissible.

Section 9C—Witness Testimony by Former and Current Air Force Personnel

9.13. Release Authorities for Witness Testimony. The following personnel are the release authorities
to allow witness testimony by former, retired and current Air Force personnel in the following litigation
situations:
   9.13.1. SJAs are the release authorities for individuals who may appear for witness testimony, depo-
   sitions, or interviews or make declarations on factual matters within their personal knowledge when it
   involves private litigation. In lieu of an available SJA, Secretariat personnel should consult with SAF/
   GC.
   9.13.2. MLCs are the release authorities for medical providers and other hospital personnel assigned
   to the MLC’s permanent station hospital who may appear for witness testimony, depositions, or inter-
   views or make declarations on factual matters within their personal knowledge when it involves pri-
   vate litigation.
   9.13.3. The chief of the appropriate civil litigation division of AFLSA or the chief of HQ USAF/JAI,
   in coordination with DoJ litigation attorneys, decides if Air Force personnel may appear and testify as
   witnesses in contemplated or pending litigation where the United States is a party or has a direct or
   indirect interest. They also determine what conditions to impose on such appearance or testimony, or
   on the release of official information related to it.
   9.13.4. The chief of the responsible AFLSA civil litigation division or the chief of HQ USAF/JAI (for
   cases in foreign courts) are denial authorities for expert or opinion testimony. AFLSA/JAC is the
   release authority for expert or opinion testimony. (See paragraph 9.20. below.)

9.14. Voluntariness of Testimony in Private Litigation. When a release authority grants permission to
Air Force personnel to provide statements or testify for prospective or actual private litigation, such state-
ments and depositions are voluntary with the individual concerned, unless required by valid legal process
or the order of competent military authority.
70                                                                     AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


9.15. Limitations After the Testimony of Air Force Personnel Is Approved. When the release of
official information is involved, Air Force personnel may produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or
testify concerning only those matters that the requester specifies in writing and which the Air Force spe-
cifically approves, except under court order, by a court of competent jurisdiction. Air Force personnel do
not give opinion or expert testimony without specific approval (see paragraph 9.20.).

9.16. Witnesses in Private Litigation.
     9.16.1. Air Force personnel may appear and testify in their nonofficial capacity in private litigation in
     which the United States has no interest if:
         9.16.1.1. This chapter does not prohibit releasing the requested information.
         9.16.1.2. The government incurs no expense.
     9.16.2. Except as noted below, Air Force personnel testifying in their nonofficial capacity in private
     litigation may do so only in other than a duty status. Examples of such status during what would oth-
     erwise be official duty hours include:
         9.16.2.1. Air Force military personnel receive a leave or a pass from their commanders.
         9.16.2.2. Air Force civilian personnel take annual leave or leave without pay, or receive court
         leave in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6322 and DOD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 8,
         Chapter 5, § 0513.
     9.16.3. Air Force military personnel testifying in a nonofficial or private capacity shall not wear their

         9.16.4.2. The witness must turn over any payment by requester for attendance and expenses to
         their Accounting and Finance Office.

9.17. Witnesses in Civilian Criminal Proceedings.
     9.17.1. Air Force military personnel under subpoena to appear and testify in state criminal proceed-
     ings that do not directly involve the Air Force or its interests may receive permissive temporary duty
     per AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, at no expense to the government.
     9.17.2. Military personnel returning from an overseas area to appear as a witness may use space
     available military transportation per DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, November 1994.
     9.17.3. Air Force military personnel who must appear and testify in criminal proceedings that are
     directly related in some way to the Air Force or the member, and in which the Air Force has a partic-
     ularly strong compelling and genuine interest may receive a temporary duty status per JFTR, para-
     graph U7062.
         9.17.3.1. Installations receiving such requests should report the request to AFLSA/JACL.
         9.17.3.2. In addition to those items in paragraph 9.9., the report should include these items of
         information:
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                           71

9.18. Witnesses in Litigation Involving the United States.
   9.18.1. When DoJ attorneys, including US Attorneys and DoJ counsel request witnesses, honor the
   request if the appearance requires no temporary duty. Advise the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation
   division or HQ USAF/JAI of all such requests.
   9.18.2. When DoJ attorneys request witnesses and the appearance requires temporary duty, the attor-
   ney must request the witness directly through DoJ Management Division's Special Authorizations
   Unit to ensure proper funding according to Title 28, C.F.R., Section 21.1. AFLSA/JACL or JACT
   directs travel, preferably by priority message or fax, with a telephone or other follow-up. The message
   or other documentation directing the travel should:
       9.18.2.1. Give the name and social security number of the witness.
       9.18.2.2. Indicate that the witness is essential.
       9.18.2.3. Explain the witness’ role and why the witness is essential.
       9.18.2.4. Provide the necessary travel and reporting instructions.
       9.18.2.5. Provide the regulatory authority for the direction.

       the relevant AFLSA civil litigation division. Use of e-mail or other communications are autho-
       rized to the extent any necessary privileges can be maintained.
   9.18.3. In hospital recovery litigation, honor requests by counsel when the request requires no tempo-
   rary duty. Otherwise, comply with AFI 51-502, Personnel and Government Recovery Claims, para-
   graph 5.18.
   9.18.4. When DoJ foreign counsel request witnesses in foreign litigation and the request requires
   temporary duty, refer the request to HQ USAF/JAI.
   9.18.5. When a private party in litigation with the United States requests or subpoenas Air Force per-
   sonnel to testify, promptly report it to the SJA.
       9.18.5.1. Before the witness testifies, the SJA advises HQ USAF/JAI or the appropriate AFLSA
       civil litigation division.
       9.18.5.2. When the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeal requests or subpoenas Air Force
       personnel to testify, report it to the AFMC LO/JAB, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5000.
72                                                                 AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


        9.18.5.3. Air Force military personnel testifying in a nonofficial capacity must ensure they are not
        in a duty status while appearing and testifying.
        9.18.5.4. Air Force civilian personnel testifying in a judicial proceeding in a nonofficial capacity
        may receive court leave per 5 U.S.C. 6322 and DOD Financial Management Regulation, Volume
        8, Chapter 5, § 0513. Otherwise, they must use annual leave or leave without pay.

9.19. Appearing at State or Local Legislative Hearings. Air Force personnel appearing or testifying,
personally or in writing, before state and local legislative bodies for the Air Force on legislative issues
must obtain prior approval from Headquarters United States Air Force, General Law Division (HQ
USAF/JAG), 1420 Air Force Pentagon Rm 5E409, Washington DC 20330-1420, telephone (703)
614-4075 or (DSN) 224-4075.
     9.19.1. Submit approval requests through command channels. Detail the proposed testimony. HQ
     USAF/JAG normally approves this type of request only:
        9.19.1.1. To serve a significant Air Force interest.
        9.19.1.2. When no conflict of interest exists.
     9.19.2. Unless serving an Air Force or DoD objective, the witness and the legislative body will pay
     the expenses.

9.20. Expert or Opinion Testimony of Air Force Personnel.
     9.20.1. Air Force personnel do not provide opinion or expert testimony concerning official Air Force
     or DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or for a party that
     DoJ represents.
        9.20.1.1. Under unique circumstances and when testimony will not adversely affect the interests
        of the Air Force or the United States, special authorization for Air Force personnel to appear and
        testify as an expert witness in private litigation at no expense to the United States may be granted.
        Requests for such special authorization must be coordinated, via the appropriate organization SJA,
        with the responsible AFLSA civil litigation division (including JACC for hospital recovery
        actions) or, in foreign jurisdiction cases, HQ USAF/JAI. The responsible AFLSA civil litigation
        division or HQ USAF/JAI or may deny the request, or forward it with a recommendation for
        approval, through AFLSA/JACL, to AFLSA/JAC. AFLSA/JAC is the approval authority for
        requests for special authorization to provide expert or opinion testimony.
        9.20.1.2. If, despite a negative final determination by AFLSA/JAC, judicial or other appropriate
        governmental authorities order Air Force personnel to appear and testify, notify AFLSA/JAC.
            9.20.1.2.1. If AFLSA/JAC decides not to seek further legal review or challenge to the court's
            order, Air Force personnel comply.
            9.20.1.2.2. The Air Force may direct Air Force personnel not to testify, in which case affected
            Air Force personnel must respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States
            ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).
        9.20.1.3. The Air Force must maintain strict impartiality in private litigation. If Air Force person-
        nel provide expert or opinion testimony in private litigation, such testimony frequently requires
        discussing their current position and duty experience. This can easily create the impression that
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                           73


       the Air Force favors a particular finding, even though it has no official interest in the outcome of
       the litigation. Furthermore, the efforts of the litigants to obtain such testimony may interfere with
       the normal functions of Air Force personnel.
   9.20.2. Civilian counsel who want Air Force personnel to give expert or opinion testimony submit
   requests to the servicing SJA.
       9.20.2.1. The SJA reviews the request and sends it with a recommendation for approval or disap-
       proval to the responsible AFLSA civil litigation division or, in foreign jurisdiction cases, HQ
       USAF/JAI. For hospital recovery actions, coordinate the request with AFLSA/JACC. The respon-
       sible AFLSA civil litigation division, AFLSA/JACC, or HQ USAF/JAI may deny the request, or
       forward it with a recommendation for approval, through AFLSA/JACL, to AFLSA/JAC. AFLSA/
       JAC is the approval authority for these requests.
       9.20.2.2. The request should include:
           9.20.2.2.1. Name of litigation and parties.
           9.20.2.2.2. Name and location of the court or tribunal.
           9.20.2.2.3. Date the litigation began and date of the requested appearance.
           9.20.2.2.4. Party for whom the request is made.
           9.20.2.2.5. Name, grade, position, and organization of the witness.
           9.20.2.2.6. Type of action, subject matter, and nature of testimony.
           9.20.2.2.7. Detailed statement showing why the Air Force should grant an exception.
   9.20.3. Air Force personnel in a nonofficial capacity may not provide expert review of evidence in
   private litigation where one of the parties in the litigation may request expert or opinion testimony
   from Air Force personnel.
       9.20.3.1. SJAs will keep Air Force personnel aware of this provision.
       9.20.3.2. After receiving approval of AFLSA/JAC to testify as an expert, Air Force personnel
       may then engage in such expert review.
   9.20.4. The Air Force does not usually consider course of treatment testimony by a treating physician
   to be expert or opinion testimony. A treating physician may testify as to his or her examination, treat-
   ment, and prognosis for a patient. However, if the scope or direction of the physician’s testimony is
   expected or likely to go beyond these areas into others involving the physician’s professional opinion
   or specialized knowledge, the physician must be treated as providing expert or opinion testimony that
   would require permission per the requirements of paragraph 9.20.1. and 9.20.2.

9.21. Expert or Opinion Testimony by Former Air Force Personnel. Former Air Force personnel
may not provide expert or opinion testimony about any matter in which they had a direct involvement
while employed by the government or serving on active duty, unless they first obtain special authorization
via the procedures outlined in paragraph 9.20.

9.22. Travel of Witnesses to Overseas Areas. Report requests for travel of witnesses to overseas areas
to testify in foreign criminal cases to HQ USAF/JAI.
   9.22.1. The Air Force does not usually fund such travel.
74                                                                  AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


     9.22.2. The requester must prove that the trip serves official purposes.
     9.22.3. The requesting command usually funds necessary official travel of witnesses in foreign crim-
     inal courts.

9.23. Travel Expenses for Witnesses.
     9.23.1. 28 U.S.C. 1821 and the JFTR/JTR govern travel allowances for Air Force personnel appear-
     ing as witnesses in litigation.
     9.23.2. JFTR paragraphs U7060 and U7061 apply to military personnel, and JTR paragraph C4502
     applies to Air Force civilian personnel employed by appropriated fund activities.
     9.23.3. The Air Force pays travel expenses for Air Force personnel assigned to Air Force activities
     who are appearing as witnesses for the United States. The unit issuing orders funds travel.
     9.23.4. Air Force personnel appearing as necessary witnesses for a party asserting the government’s
     claim for medical care expenses are witnesses for the United States if the government’s claim is large
     enough to justify the expenditure, as determined by the responsible SJA.
     9.23.5. When Air Force personnel appear as witnesses for the United States, but the Air Force is not
     involved in the litigation, AFLSA/JACL, or JACT (in cases arising under AFI 51-501), instructs the
     unit issuing the orders on how to obtain travel reimbursement.
     9.23.6. When Air Force military personnel are under subpoena to appear as witnesses for a committee
     of the Congress, private individual, or a corporation, they do not receive any allowances for travel
     from the Air Force. The party requesting testimony arranges payment in advance.
     9.23.7. When Air Force civilian personnel employed by appropriated fund activities must testify in
     their official capacity or produce official records on behalf of a party other than the United States, the
     other party pays allowable travel expenses.
     9.23.8. Since trials are frequently postponed or canceled after a witness receives orders, a witness
     must not begin travel (except when common carrier scheduling requires it) more than 1 day before the
     date on which the witness must report to the requesting US Attorney. Similarly, witnesses may not
     take temporary duty leave immediately before testifying.
     9.23.9. Civilian employees under subpoena to testify in civilian criminal proceedings or on behalf of
     a private party in connection with any judicial proceeding to which the United States, a state, or local
     government is a party, may receive court leave per 5 U.S.C. 6322. They may not receive government
     travel expenses.
     9.23.10. Witnesses frequently receive payment (witness fee) for testifying and reimbursement for
     expenses. Air Force personnel on active duty and civilians on court leave must turn in any witness
     fees to their Accounting and Finance Office.
        9.23.10.1. They may keep any reimbursements that they receive from a court or party, unless they
        are on temporary duty and are receiving government travel expenses, in which case they must turn
        in reimbursements to their accounting and finance office.
AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006                                                                             75


Section 9D—Serving on State and Local Juries by Members of the Air Force

9.24. Terms.
   9.24.1. State. Includes the 50 United States, US Territories, the District of Columbia, and the Com-
   monwealth of Puerto Rico.
   9.24.2. Active Duty. Full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. This includes:
       9.24.2.1. Full-time training duty.
       9.24.2.2. Annual training duty.
       9.24.2.3. Active duty for training.
       9.24.2.4. Attending a service school while on active military service.
   9.24.3. Operating Forces. Forces whose primary missions are participating in and supporting combat.

9.25. Legal Authority for Exemption. Under 10 U.S.C. 982, Air Force members are exempt from jury
duty under certain circumstances. In implementing 10 U.S.C. 982, DOD Directive 5525.8, Service By
Members of the Armed Forces on State and Local Juries, June 13, 1988, paragraph 6.3. categorically
exempts all general officers, commanders, operating forces personnel in training, and personnel stationed
outside the United States from serving on a state or local jury. Also, 10 U.S.C. 982 generally exempts mil-
itary members from jury duty when:
   9.25.1. Such duty unreasonably interferes with their military duties; or
   9.25.2. Adversely affects the readiness of a unit, command, or activity to which the member is
   assigned.

9.26. Delegation of Decision Authority. The Secretary of the Air Force has delegated the authority
under 10 U.S.C. 982 to determine such exemptions to commanders. Exemption denial authority has been
delegated to immediate or higher level commanders. Exemption approval authority has been delegated to
special court-martial convening authority or higher level commanders. The approval decision of the spe-
cial court-martial convening authority acting as the designee of the Secretary is final. Additionally, notifi-
cation authority to state and local officials of exemption from jury duty pursuant to DODD 5525.8,
paragraph 6.3. has been further delegated to immediate commanders or their designees.

9.27. Procedures For Obtaining an Exemption From Jury Duty. When an Air Force member on
active duty receives a summons to state or local jury duty, the member immediately informs his or her
immediate commander.
   9.27.1. If the member is categorically exempt under DODD 5525.8, paragraph 6.3., the immediate
   commander or designee notifies the issuing state or local official.
   9.27.2. If the member is not categorically exempt under DODD 5525.8, paragraph 6.3., the immedi-
   ate commander decides if the exemption under 10 U.S.C. 982 applies. If the immediate commander
   decides that exemption is inappropriate, the member must serve jury duty.
   9.27.3. If the immediate commander decides the 10 U.S.C. 982 exemption applies to the member, the
   immediate commander forwards a request for approval of such exemption to the special court-martial
   convening authority, who makes the decision using the statutory criteria outlined in paragraph 9.25. A
76                                                                 AFI51-301_USAFE_I 21 JUNE 2006


     special court-martial convening authority may request the advice and assistance of her or his servicing
     SJA in making decisions about these requests.
        9.27.3.1. The special court-martial convening authority may decide that:
            9.27.3.1.1. Exemption is inappropriate and instructs the member to comply with the jury duty
            summons.
            9.27.3.1.2. Exemption is appropriate and tells the immediate commander to send a written
            notice of the exemption to the issuing state or local official.
     9.27.4. Include these items of information in a written notice of exemption:
             "(Grade and Name), a member of the United States Air Force on active duty, has been
             summoned to perform jury duty (when, where, and on what jury). Under 10 U.S.C. 982,
             DoDD 5525.8, and Air Force Instruction 51-301, this member has been determined by the
             Secretary of the Air Force or an authorized designee as exempt from duty on the jury in
             question because such jury service would unreasonably interfere with the performance of the
             member's military duties or would adversely affect the readiness of the unit, command, or
             activity to which the member is assigned. Under 10 U.S.C. 982(b), this determination is
             conclusive."
     9.27.5. Do not charge jury duty service against leave or deduct pay or entitlements for the period of
     service.
     9.27.6. All fees to members for jury service are payable to the US Treasury.
     9.27.7. Members may receive, and keep, reimbursement from the state or local jury authority for
     expenses incurred in the performance of jury duty, such as transportation costs or parking fees.
