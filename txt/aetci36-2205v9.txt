                             TRAINING ADMINISTRATION

1.1. General. This volume in conjunction with AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, outlines
responsibilities and procedures for conducting AETC battle management training.
1.2. Responsibilities. Assigned and gained organizations will institute procedures to ensure
training documentation, practices, and procedures are accomplished in accordance with (IAW)
this instruction. Specific responsibilities are as follows:
   1.2.1. HQ AETC/A3ZA is the command manager for battle management training syllabuses.
   HQ AETC/A3ZA coordinates air battle manager (ABM), weapons director (WD) and
   weapons technician syllabuses with AETC functional offices and other command offices as
   required, develops policy, and provides student management oversight. HQ AETC/A3ZA
   edits, coordinates, and gains HQ AETC/A2/3/10 approval for all training syllabuses.
   1.2.2. Assigned and gained units conducting AETC battle management training will draft
   syllabuses and submit them to HQ AETC/A3ZA. Unit subject matter specialists or training
   development shops will use combat air forces-approved training task lists to develop each
   syllabus based on templates provided by HQ AETC/A3ZA.
   1.2.3. Assigned unit commanders will establish responsibilities and procedures for planning,
   developing, preparing, implementing, reviewing, and evaluating AETC battle management
   training at the execution level. Assigned unit commanders will also:
       1.2.3.1. Conduct battle management training IAW approved syllabuses.
       1.2.3.2. Ensure guidance for battle management training course attendance found in HQ
       AETC’s      education     and    training     course   announcements     (ETCA)     at
       https://rso.my.af.mil/etcacourses/ is current and adhered to.
       1.2.3.3. (107 ACS and 325 ACS Only) Establish a registrar function to oversee student
       administrative duties for formal battle management courses.
       1.2.3.4. Develop training courseware to support student learning outcomes, which
       include instructor guides, student handouts, instructor handouts, computer-based
       instruction, and instructional media (electronic imagery, video productions, etc.) as
       needed.

                                           Chapter 2

                               STUDENT ADMINISTRATION

2.1. Course Entry Administration. Units review incoming student records to verify they are
complete. Students must meet course entry prerequisites established in the ETCA. If a student
does not meet the course entry prerequisites, contact HQ AETC/A3ZA before entering the
student into training. As a minimum, units review the following student records (or their
equivalent) prior to any formal training:
    2.1.1. Training     Summaries       (AETC      Form      1122    Series)     and    Student
    Biographies. Documentation of academic and positional training accomplishments provides
    a current record of a student’s training progression. The operations officer (SQ/DO),
    operations training officer, class or flight commander or supervisor (Class CC, FLT/CC,
    class or FLT supervisor), or designated representative should review all training summaries
    and student biographies included in the student training record. Refer to AETCI 13-103,
    Battle Management Training Program, for specifics on establishing permanent training
    records.
    2.1.2. Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Records. Where applicable, these records
    are maintained in the flight evaluation folder as detailed in AETCI 13-104, Battle
    Management Standardization and Evaluation Program. Evaluation folders (EF) are designed
    to maintain those basic source documents that provide a history of an individual’s
    qualifications. Students hand-carry EFs (if previously established) IAW the ETCA course
    requirements. If required, forward applicable stan/eval records and documents to the
    student’s home or gaining unit upon completion of training.
    2.1.3. Individual Flight Records. See the appropriate weapon system training documents
    for flight record requirements.
    2.1.4. Medical Qualifications (107 ACS Only). If medical qualifications (AF IMT 1042,
    Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty) for a student cannot be
    determined in 10 workdays or if the parent organization takes no corrective action within the
    prescribed number of days, the registrar will notify the student’s parent organization, HQ
    AETC/A3ZA, 19AF/DOG, or NGB/A3T (as appropriate) of the reason for disqualification
    (prerequisite elimination), and return the student to the home unit. (AF IMT 1042 is
    prescribed by AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. Refer to that publication
    for guidance on filling out the form.)
2.2. Quota Management. The programmed flying training (PFT) document establishes the
baseline for student quota management. HQ AETC/A3RA maintains the quota management
worksheets, which reflect real-time changes and are the AETC aircrew training primary source
documents for class entry, student load, and production schedule information, and is available on
the       Community          of       Practice       (CoP)        website       located         at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AE-57.
    2.2.1. Units should obtain class entry rosters in the Military Personnel Data System/Oracle
    Training Administration (MilPDS/OTA) not later than 2 weeks before class entry. Rosters
    should be obtained as early as possible to allow identification of excess capacity.
AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 7


   2.2.2. Units report class entry roster discrepancies as soon as they are discovered, but no
   later than 3 days following the class start date. Report changes, discrepancies, and graduation
   delays to HQ AETC/A3RA, HQ AFPC/DPPAO or DPAOT, and 19 AF/DO.
2.3. Class Quotas. HQ AETC provides yearly class quotas via electronic PFT pages published
on the AETC PFT/flying hours/metrics program CoP (paragraph 2.2). HQ AETC offices of
primary responsibility (OPR) notify affected units of quota changes.
2.4. Production Metrics Report. HQ AETC/A3RA is the point of contact for flying training
production metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, HQ AETC/A3RA uploads the PFT
document to the Flying Training Production Analysis (FTPA) web-based input tool. The unit
student accounting and registrar (SAR) updates the FTPA with actual entries, gains, losses,
attritions, graduate numbers and notes, if applicable.
2.5. Special Reporting Procedures for ANG and AFRC Students. SQ/CCs ensure the
following actions are taken: (Note: This reporting is exempt from report control symbol (RCS)
reporting according to AFI 33324, The Information Collections and Reports Management
Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.)
   2.5.1. For ANG or AFRC Students Experiencing Difficulty. Training units will notify 19
   AF/DOG as well as 19 AF/CCR or 19 AF/CCG, as appropriate, via message (19 AF
   RANDOLPH AFB TX//CCR/CCG//) or electronic mail (email) when an ANG or AFRC
   student requires a progress check (PC) or an elimination check (EC), enters the commander’s
   review (CR) process, is placed on administrative or medical hold, or is eliminated from or
   reinstated in training. In addition, notify 19 AF/CCR or 19 AF/CCG, as appropriate, when
   there is reasonable doubt about a student’s potential to complete a training syllabus. Include
   the student’s home unit and NGB/A1DF/A3T or HQ AFRC/A3T, as applicable, as
   addressees on these messages or E-mails.
   2.5.2. Graduation Notification. When the PFT graduation date changes, units notify the
   student’s home unit and NGB/A1DF or HQ AFRC/A1MB, as appropriate. Notify by
   message or E-mail of the student’s new graduation date no later than 30 days before the new
   date, or immediately if within 30 days of graduation. When it appears that a student may
   graduate late, notify the student’s home unit as soon as possible. Send an information copy to
   19 AF/CCR or 19 AF/CCG, as appropriate.
2.6. Fitness Standards (Undergraduate Air Battle Manager Training [UABMT] only):
   2.6.1. Students participate in a scheduled physical training (PT) program IAW the
   appropriate syllabus and HQ AETC guidance.
   2.6.2. US Air Force UABMT students must take and pass the Air Force physical fitness test
   prior to starting simulator mission training. If a student has not met fitness standards by the
   beginning of simulator mission training, they will be placed on administrative hold status
   until passing the Air Force fitness standards, at which point they will be entered back into
   training. If the student has not met the minimum fitness standards after 90 days of being on
   administrative hold, contact HQ AETC/A3F to determine follow-on actions.
2.7. Administrative Hold. Place students whose training has been suspended for other than
medical reasons for more than 7 calendar days on administrative hold. Administrative hold
should be used judiciously for extenuating circumstances to include family serious illness or
8                                                     AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010


death, or other personal problems beyond the individual’s control. If a permanent change of
station (PCS) status student is on administrative hold for more than 30 calendar days (10 days for
temporary duty [TDY] students), or may reach this threshold, notify HQ AETC/A3Z.
2.8. Students in Transition Status (325 ACS Only). Commanders assign students awaiting
PCS training, eliminees, and those on medical or administrative hold, etc., to duties
commensurate with their background, training, and grade.
    2.8.1. Students Awaiting UABMT. Students awaiting the start of UABMT may be
    assigned to duties outside the 325 ACS. The 325 ACS Registrar manages this program and
    tracks students.
       2.8.1.1. Students awaiting the start of UABMT may voluntarily observe missions as
       available on a non-interference basis.
       2.8.1.2. Under no circumstances will students awaiting UABM training receive any
       instruction outside the normal syllabus flow.
    2.8.2. Graduates of UABMT. Students who have graduated the undergraduate air battle
    manager (UABM) program but are awaiting follow-on training will be provided the
    opportunity to observe and control missions on a space available/non-interference basis. This
    opportunity is voluntary, and is provided to help maintain proficiency of controlling and
    airmanship skills between assignments.
       2.8.2.1. Observation Missions. Post graduate students will be allowed to observe
       missions on an unlimited basis. During these missions the student is NOT an active
       participant in the mission event. The student is encouraged to attend all mission events
       (briefing, execution, and debriefing) to enhance the learning opportunity. If mission
       equipment is available (UABMT System console), the student is encouraged to use the
       equipment to practice radar scope interpretation skills.
       2.8.2.2. Break-in-Training (BIT) Missions. BIT missions are designed to allow the
       students an opportunity to control missions and/or receive airmanship sorties following
       graduation from the UABM course. Instructors are highly encouraged to be assigned to
       simulation missions to provide feedback to the students to ensure students receiving BIT
       missions do not develop poor skills/habits prior to attending follow-on courses. Post-
       graduate students controlling any live event must have a dedicated instructor since they
       are not qualified ABMs.
       2.8.2.3. Post Graduate Students Awaiting Training. Post graduate students awaiting
       permanent change of station (PCS) training for an extended period of time may be
       entered into the 325 ACS IQT program to obtain an MU-2 only qualification. Enter the
       student into IQT and manage IAW AETCI 13-103 and 13-104. Students gaining MU-2
       only qualification will be allowed to control missions; but an instructor must be present,
       either as an adversary controller or working with a student on the same mission event.

                                STUDENT MANAGEMENT

3.1. Commander’s Awareness Program (CAP):
   3.1.1. Objective. The objective of CAP is to focus supervisory attention on a student’s
   progress in training, specific deficiencies, and potential to complete the program. CAP may
   also be used to monitor personal or disciplinary issues requiring supervisory attention.
   3.1.2. Categories. CAP is divided into the following categories:
      3.1.2.1. Positional. Students demonstrating deficiencies in an aircrew training
      device/weapons control training device, in live or simulated missions.
      3.1.2.2. Academic. Students exhibiting substandard academic performance (test failure).
      Units may use additional local procedures to monitor students who demonstrate marginal
      academic performance (example: an academic average less than 90 percent). See
      paragraph 3.1.3 below.
      3.1.2.3. Professional. Students exhibiting substandard military or professional behavior.
      3.1.2.4. Other. Students with personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
   3.1.3. Local Guidance. Units develop specific CAP guidance as it relates to the unit’s
   mission. This guidance should address such topics as criteria for different CAP categories,
   student or training activity restrictions, and instructor continuity requirements.
   3.1.4. SQ/CC Responsibilities. The SQ/CC administers CAP. Note: CAP administration
   may be delegated to the SQ/DO, squadron assistant operations officer (SQ/ADO), class or
   flight/CC, or supervisor; but the SQ/CC maintains overall authority and responsibility.
   3.1.5. CAP Procedures. The class/flight/CC/supervisor, SQ/DO, or SQ/CC places the
   student on CAP, and the SQ/CC removes the student from CAP when sustained normal
   progress is demonstrated or when personal issues are resolved. Although CAP is intended to
   be a short-term program, removal should not be strictly event based (i.e., passing a category
   check) if the student’s weak areas can carry over into the next unit/category. A student
   requiring an extended period of increased supervision or repeated placement on CAP should
   be considered for a PC, EC or Commander’s Review.
      3.1.5.1. Generate an AETC Form 101, Student Performance Summary, for any student
      placed on CAP for non-progression of a positional event, an academic test, or for an
      officership or airmanship problem. AETC Form 101 is a permanent part of the student’s
      training record. Document the activity on the AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record,
      brief the student, and have the student initial/sign the AF Form 4293. (AETC Form 101 is
      prescribed by AETCI 36-2205, Volume 4, Formal Flying Training Administration and
      Management—T-1, T-6, T-37, T-38, T-43, and UH/TH/1H. AF Form 4293 is prescribed
      by AFI 11-2T-1V1, T-1A Aircrew Training. Refer to those publications for guidance on
      filling out the forms.)
      3.1.5.2. While the student is in CAP, tailor training to address the student’s particular
      situation within the limits of the syllabus. Contractor-provided training is conducted IAW
10                                                    AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010


        the training contract. The class/flight/CC closely monitors instructor continuity and
        ensures proficiency standards are not being compromised to permit CAP students to
        progress in training.
        3.1.5.3. The class/flight/CC/supervisor or designated representative counsels the student
        when placed on and removed from CAP. Initial counseling covers CAP objectives,
        student training plan, instructor continuity, and CAP removal goals. Additional
        counseling is done at the discretion of the class/flight/CC/supervisor or designated
        representative but is required if the student fails to meet the CAP removal goals.
        Document all counseling in the student’s training folder.
        3.1.5.4. The student’s class or flight/CC or course manager briefs squadron leadership
        weekly on the student’s progress. As a minimum, this briefing includes the student’s
        strong and weak areas, additional training (AT) details, and anticipated removal date
        from CAP.
3.2. Progress Checks and Elimination Checks. PCs and ECs are key events in the CR
process. Triggers for these events are defined in the applicable syllabus.
3.3. Commanders Review (CR) Process:
     3.3.1. Overview. The CR process recommends the student’s elimination or retention in
     training. It must be completed within 10 duty days (24 duty days for international students)
     from the date the initiating authority (IA) signs the AETC Form 143, Record of
     Commander’s Review Action (ABM/CSO), or AETC Form 144, Record of Commander’s
     Review Action (Weapons Director).
     3.3.2. Entry. Enter students failing to progress in the normal syllabus flow into the CR
     process. The FLT/CC, SQ/DO, or SQ/CC enters the student in the CR process as outlined in
     each syllabus.
     3.3.3. IA. The SQ/CC with administrative control of the student is the IA. This is normally
     the SQ/CC conducting the student’s syllabus training. The IA:
        3.3.3.1. Notifies students in writing of their consideration for elimination (Attachment
        2). For international students, also notify the local base international military student
        office (IMSO).
        3.3.3.2. Briefs the student on the CR process (Attachment 3).
        3.3.3.3. Removes the student from training. The IA may elect to continue the student in
        academic training with reviewing authority (RA) concurrence. 325 ACS only: The IA
        should instruct the undergraduate student not to wear the flight suit.
        3.3.3.4. Completes Section I of AETC Form 143 or 144 and ensures the student
        completes Section II.
        3.3.3.5. Advises the student to submit a ―show cause‖ memorandum within 2 work days,
        identifying any factors that may have affected training.
        3.3.3.6. Sends the completed AETC Form 143 or 144 with the student’s memorandum,
        training records, and any attachments to the RA.
AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              11


   3.3.4. RA. The operations group commander (OG/CC) is the RA. (Note: 107 ACS RA is
   the Arizona ANG/CC.) The RA:
      3.3.4.1. Reviews the undergraduate student’s training and recommends elimination from
      or retention in training. The RA may delegate this authority to the operations group
      deputy commander (OG/CD), or in the absence of either the OG/CC or OG/CD to the
      operations support SQ/CC, or any flying training SQ/CC (not to include the student’s
      SQ/CC). The RA examines the student’s training records and, as deemed necessary,
      interviews the student and FLT/CC/supervisor or SQ/CC. For a battle management
      instructor training (BMIT) or IQT student, the OG/CC reviews the student’s training and
      either reinstates the student in training or recommends elimination. The OG/CC may
      delegate this authority to the OG/CD.
      3.3.4.2. Completes Sections III and IV of AETC Form 143 or 144 and forwards the form
      with all applicable records to the approving authority (AA) for final review. These
      records include a written summary of the significant facts and specific rationale used to
      arrive at the recommendations.
      3.3.4.3. Terminates the CR process if it becomes apparent that circumstances require
      convening an investigation under the provisions of AFI 51602, Boards of Officers, or
      when information arises that would cause the student to be medically disqualified.
   3.3.5. AA. The wing commander (WG/CC) is the AA. (Note: 107 ACS AA is 19 AF/DO.)
   The AA:
      3.3.5.1. Eliminates or reinstates the student.
      3.3.5.2. Completes Section V of AETC Form 143 or 144. Do not recommend UABMT
      eliminees for entry into undergraduate pilot training. Do not recommend students
      eliminated for manifestation of apprehension (MOA) or drop-on-request (DOR) for any
      other flying training.
      3.3.5.3. For BMIT/IQT, completes section IV of AETC Form 143 or 144.
      3.3.5.4. For medical eliminees, provides a statement in Section IV of AETC Form 143 or
      144 evaluating the student’s ability to complete training if medically requalified.
3.4. Student Eliminations:
   3.4.1. Students should be eliminated if they:
      3.4.1.1. Exhibit lack of adaptability (LOA), which is the inability to complete the course
      because of physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an
      evaluation from both medical and operational personnel. This category includes MOA.
      Annotate specific deficiencies in the remarks section of AETC Form 143 or 144.
      3.4.1.2. Fail to meet proficiency standards of the syllabus in flying, academics, or
      procedures.
      3.4.1.3. Fail to demonstrate the potential to complete the course within syllabus
      constraints.
12                                                       AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010


        3.4.1.4. Receive punitive action under the articles of the Uniform Code of Military
        Justice. Note: Students being eliminated for punitive actions are entitled legal assistance
        from the Area Defense Counsel.
        3.4.1.5. Fail to meet standards prescribed in AFI 10248, Fitness Program.
     3.4.2. Eliminate students if they:
        3.4.2.1. DOR. Note: Only UABMT students are eligible to DOR.
        3.4.2.2. UABMTs when they become medically disqualified. However, if a flight
        surgeon determines the disqualification may resolve within 12 months of the initial
        disqualification, place the student in medical hold status.
        3.4.2.3. Because of the temporary duty status of undergraduate WD students, make a
        decision to eliminate within 10 duty days of entry into the program. If the flight surgeon
        determines the disqualification may resolve within another 10 duty days, forward the
        request to 19AF/DOG, HQ AETC/A3ZA, and the student’s home unit to decide if
        elimination or course continuation is warranted. Note: UABM students placed in duties
        not involving flying (DNIF) or duties not involving controlling (DNIC) status for more
        than 30 days are either placed in medical hold status or considered for medical
        disqualification. In general, medical conditions expected to resolve within 12 months and
        assessed as likely to permit the individual to return to Flying Class III (or ground-based
        controller) duties should result in a determination to place the individual on medical hold.
        All other medical disqualifications should result in disenrollment, medical elimination,
        and reassignment or processing for separation. For detailed information, refer to AETCI
        48102, Medical Management of Undergraduate Flying Training Students, and Chapter 4
        of this publication.
        3.4.2.4. Initiate action to separate from the service.
        3.4.2.5. Are recalled from their home units. Units will notify HQ AETC/A3Z and 19
        AF/DOG when a student recall is needed. In the event the commander deems an
        immediate emergency situation, then the notification can occur after the recall.
        3.4.2.6. Are involved in drug abuse substantiated by reliable evidence.
        3.4.2.7. Are adjudicated absent without leave, are confined, or have deserted
        3.4.2.8. Are hospitalized for an extended period (as the WG/CC determines). Student
        may be considered for reinstatement at a later date.
        3.4.2.9. Demonstrate improper attitude or lack of responsibility toward assigned duties or
        obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt about the student’s
        fitness for training.
     3.4.3. 325 FW/CC acts as the authority to determine if an officer should be eliminated from
     UABMT for misconduct which results in, or warrants, nonjudicial punishment. Based on the
     totality of the circumstances, the respective subordinate commander recommends whether an
     officer should be eliminated from training. When the misconduct is serious enough to
     warrant discharge from service under AFI 363206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for
     Commissioned Officers, the responsible AETC show-cause authority initiates discharge
AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               13


   action. Otherwise, 19 AF/CC makes recommendations to the Air Force Personnel Center
   (HQ AFPC) concerning reclassification and discharge of these officers.
   3.4.4. The HQ AETC/A2/3/10 monitors elimination of female and minority students from
   flying training in order to identify any trends in female/minority performance in flying
   training.
       3.4.4.1. HQ AETC/A3R collects female and minority elimination data for undergraduate
       flying training to include undergraduate pilot, navigator, and ABM training.
       3.4.4.2. Generate the data from information each flying unit provides as part of the
       FPTA web based.
       3.4.4.3. The 19 AF/DO provides specific elimination case data as requested by HQ
       AETC.
3.5. Student Dispositions:
   3.5.1. Students reinstated into training after a CR complete an EC following completion of
   any additional training. Students reinstated after academic deficiencies repeat the exam after
   appropriate additional training.
   3.5.2. After completing Section V of AETC Form 143 or 144, process eliminated students
   under AFI 363206; AFI 363207, Separating Commissioned Officers; AFI 362110,
   Assignments; or the ETCA. Process international students IAW AFI 16105, Joint Security
   Assistance Training (JSAT). Process pipeline or PCS students through appropriate personnel
   channels.
   3.5.3. WD students and NGB/AFRC ABM students eliminated from their respective courses
   are returned to their home unit (or gaining unit in the case of training conducted during a
   PCS move).
3.6. CR Records Distribution:
   3.6.1. The school registrar or similarly designated authority maintains original CR records
   according to the RDS and distributes them within 12 duty days of completion of the CR.
   These records must be available for review.
   3.6.2. The unit SAR office distributes eliminated officers’ CR records as outlined in Table
   3.1 and maintain IAW the RDS.
   3.6.3. The course registrar ensures each elimination case is updated in the training
   management database with an elimination code.

                                            Chapter 4

                                  MEDICAL HOLD STATUS

4.1. Initial Medical Hold Status. The WG/CC authorizes initial medical hold status. SQ/CCs,
with attending flight surgeon concurrence, make recommendations to the OG/CC and WG/CC in
medical hold cases.
4.2. PCS and TDY Status Students. PCS status students placed in DNIF/DNIC status that
affects training (academics, simulators, or aircraft) for more than 30 days should either be placed
in medical hold status or be considered for medical disqualification. In general, students should
be placed in medical hold if their medical condition is expected to be resolved within 12 months
and permits a return to Flying Class III, or ground-based controller duties. TDY status students
(example: WD students) should be processed as quickly as possible. If the TDY status student
experiences a delay beyond 5 training days, contact 19AF/DOG for assistance. All other
disqualifications should result in disenrollment, elimination, and reassignment or processing for
separation. (Notify the NGB/A3 or HQ AFRC/A3, as applicable, when medical hold or
disqualification is warranted for NGB and AFRC students.) For further information, see AETCI
48102, Medical Management of Undergraduate Flying Training Students.
4.3. Students with Medical Condition. Place students in medical hold status only when a
medical condition does not resolve after 30 days. In such cases, medical hold status is effective
on the 31st day of DNIF or DNIC. IAW AETCI 48102, the WG/CC may authorize medical hold
status for up to 3 months for students with remedial or temporarily disqualifying conditions. On
the written recommendation of the WG/CC and attending flight surgeon, HQ AETC/SGPS may
extend a student’s medical hold up to a total of 6 months. Submit an aeromedical summary with
the documentation requesting an extension of medical hold status.
4.4. Students on Medical Hold from 6 to 12 Months. Students who must remain on medical
hold from 6 to 12 months must be approved by the 19 AF/DO. Prior approval by HQ
AETC/SGPS is required for an extension of up to 6 months, but approval may be requested
simultaneously by concurrent coordination. Continue to report students approved for up to 12
months of medical hold IAW AETCI 48102. When a student extended beyond 6 months is
returned to or eliminated from training, notify both HQ AETC/SGPS and 19 AF/DO. The
NGB/A3 or HQ AFRC/A3, as applicable, must approve medical hold status for NGB or AFRC
students.
4.5. Documentation. Units process medical hold actions using appropriately routed
memorandums, supporting documentation (AF Form 4293, grade sheet, etc.), and AETC Form
125A. If the medical hold does not resolve, initiate elimination for medical disqualification
according to normal procedures.

awards may be presented for ties. AETCI 362801, AETC Recognition Program, governs
appropriations for such awards.
5.2. Awards:
   5.2.1. Procedures. The 325 ACS/CC may select students from each class as distinguished
   graduates (DG) and present them an award. For each class, the 325 ACS/CC is the final
   approving authority for all awards presented. As a minimum, a DG award requires a student
   to be in the upper 10 percent of the graduating class. (Round fractional numbers to the next
   nearest whole number.) If a DG is an NGB or AFRC member, notify the home unit as soon
   as possible to ensure unit officials are aware and invited to the award presentation.
   5.2.2. Mementoes. Purchase plaques or trophies from appropriated funds using
   specifications outlined in AFI 65601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.

                          STUDENT TRAINING INFORMATION

6.1. Introduction. Training information is maintained by either an electronic or paper copy of
documents used to compile and track information related to each student’s progress. Training
and personal information folders contain confidential information about the progress of each
student and must be maintained accordingly. Class or FLT/CCs, supervisors, and staff instructors
maintain the folders on a daily basis. A backup version may be maintained at the unit’s
discretion. Specify procedures in local unit guidance. Students may only access their specific
student training folder. Note: Refer to AETCI 13-103 for permanent party students.
6.2. Contents:
   6.2.1. Personal Information. Personal information must be maintained separately from the
   actual training folder. Units may use personal information files (PIF), or class, FLT/CC, or
   supervisor books to keep personal and/or sensitive information separate from specific
   training information. This information may also be kept in electronic form. This information
   must be secured to prevent inadvertent or deliberate access by unauthorized personnel.
   Examples of personal information to be maintained separate from training folders are:
       6.2.1.1. AF IMT 174.
       6.2.1.2. AF IMT 1042.
       6.2.1.3. .AETC Form 101.
       6.2.1.4. AETC Form 904.
       6.2.1.5. Student biographies (ABM only).
   6.2.2. Training Folders. Training folders contain information specific to the student’s
   training history and performance. The student training folder will contain:
       6.2.2.1. AETC Form 186.
       6.2.2.2. AF Form 4293.
       6.2.2.3. AETC Form 6, Waiver Request. (AETC Form 6 is prescribed by AETCI 362205,
       Volume 4. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
       6.2.2.4. AETC Form 902 (or Graduate Training Information Management System
       [GTIMS]).
6.3. Documentation. Document student training issues on AF Form 4293. Instructors provide a
concise summary of the student’s training and ensure entries clarify any training action. Begin
each entry with date of the event, subject or syllabus lesson numbers, overall lesson grade, and
lesson duration (if applicable). End the entry with the signature, printed name, grade, and duty
title of the instructor making the entry. The student, student’s assigned instructor and class or
FLT/CC/supervisor initials all AF Form 4293 entries. Documentation is required for the
following:
   6.3.1. Administrative hold.
   6.3.2. Temporary medical disqualification (DNIF/DNIC status).

     6.3.3. Failure of any academic test, category check, flight evaluation, PC, or EC. (Update
     AETC Form 101, if used.)
     6.3.4. Counseling sessions concerning training progress. Note: If the counseling involves
     sensitive personal problems, document the session on AF IMT 174, and keep the form in the
     student’s personal information folders. Annotate on an AF Form 4293 in the student’s
     training folder that a counseling session was conducted.
     6.3.5. Assignment to and removal from CAP.
     6.3.6. Training folder review prior to a PC, EC, or CR. Document any training anomalies,
     syllabus deviations, etc.
     6.3.7. Incomplete lessons or items deferred to next mission.
     6.3.8. Authorization for AT. The authorization authority identifies the reasons for the AT
     sortie and signs or initials the entry.
     6.3.9. Accomplishment of AT mission or simulator. Document any substandard
     performance.
     6.3.10. Removal from or reinstatement into training.
     6.3.11. Syllabus deviations or training waivers.
     6.3.12. Unusual occurrences that could affect the student’s progress.
     6.3.13. Lessons graded overall unsatisfactory. Use the cause and effect format to document
     substandard performance and identify the root cause.
6.4. Student Training Records Disposition. Student training records are forwarded to the
student’s unit via certified mail. The PIF will be sent directly to the student. Use appropriate E-
mail encryption features to properly safeguard information sent electronically. Upon completion
of training or disenrollment, the SAR office forwards training folder, which contains all AF
IMTs 4293 and information pertinent for future reviews, to 19AF/DOG for archiving. The SAR
also retains a copy of training documentation (minus the AETC Form 186), for 1 year from
completion of training. The copy can be in either hard copy or electronic format , which includes
portable document format (.pdf), Include student résumés, all category grade sheets, and all AF
IMTs 4293. Table 6.1 describes distribution of training documents, including forms, records, and
reports.

7.1. Class Commander/Supervisor Responsibilities. The class CC or supervisor is the first
echelon of command responsible for safely and efficiently scheduling people, mission, and
operations training. The class CC and supervisor must know the capabilities and experience
levels of all flight members and ensure they are matched to the right mission at the right time
according to applicable syllabuses and directives. Safety must remain paramount. Class CCs or
supervisors keep the operations supervisors informed of the training plan and any changes. Class
CC and supervisor responsibilities include:
   7.1.1. Conduct class orientation.
   7.1.2. Supervise and monitor student training.
   7.1.3. Assist students and supervisors with the training review process and provide for
   discipline, physical and mental well-being, and general welfare of students. The class CC and
   supervisor must be aware of each student’s progress in all areas, including the potential effect
   of external factors (personal problems, etc.). Class CCs and supervisors:
       7.1.3.1. Perform student counseling in close coordination with squadron leadership
       (performance, personal, or disciplinary).
       7.1.3.2. Counsel students when they are determined to be marginal performers or are
       placed on CAP. Conduct followup counseling as often thereafter as necessary.
       7.1.3.3. Counsel students as necessary on appropriate management issues, including
       personal problems and disciplinary matters. Refer students to appropriate base support
       agencies (Chaplain, legal office, etc.) for further assistance, if necessary.
       7.1.3.4. Conduct safety briefings before long weekends or extended holiday          breaks.
       (Have all students fill out AETC Form 29B, Predeparture Safety Briefing, and        give to
       course registrar to be filed in the student’s PIF.) (AETC Form 29B is prescribed    by AFI
       91-202/AETC Sup 1, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. Refer                to that
       publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
   7.1.4. Maintain student training folders IAW Chapter 6, local guidance, and the applicable
   syllabus. Review student grade books at least twice each month for accuracy (grade sheets,
   signatures, initials, AETC Form 902, etc.).
   7.1.5. Ensure proper management of the physical training (PT) program as applicable.
   (Optional: permanent party instructor, class CC, or supervisor responsibility).
   7.1.6. Coordinate with academic supervisors, subject matter experts, and squadron
   leadership on individual student performance.
   7.1.7. Ensure students are briefed on assignment opportunities as applicable.
   7.1.8. Brief student leaders (class leaders) on the scope and limits of their responsibilities.
   (Optional: Class CC or supervisor responsibility).

24                                                      AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010


        7.1.8.2. Meet regularly with student and class leaders to discuss possible flight issues.
     7.1.9. Designate (and make public) an alternate class CC and supervisor when not available.
     If no alternates are available, the course manager will assume the duties of the class CC or
     supervisor.
     7.1.10. Assist in syllabus-directed functions.
        7.1.10.1. Ensure block subject matter experts (SMEs) complete ―end-of-block student
        reports‖ (as applicable).
        7.1.10.2. Oversee PCs and ECs when accomplished.
     7.1.11. Prepare graduation or elimination packages IAW AETC guidelines.
     7.1.12. Assist and/or conduct student graduations (depending on course).
7.2. Student Scheduling. Units place students removed from training for more than 5 duty days
(holiday standdown, breaks in pipeline training courses, etc.) in a pass, leave, DNIF, or
administrative hold status until their training resumes.
7.3. Student Leave. Ordinary leave is not normally authorized for students participating in
UABMT or WD training. Emergency leave is permitted when the emergency is confirmed by the
Red Cross or home unit leadership. The class CC or supervisor will record student absences on a
memorandum for record filed with the student’s training records. Student leave approval rests
with the SQ/CC or DO and is based on the individual circumstances surrounding the request.
7.4. Additional Training. AT provides extra training to students in specific circumstances to
include category check failure, break-in-training, CR reinstatement, syllabus waiver, OG/CC
corrective actions, or as otherwise specifically authorized by the syllabus. Refer to the applicable
syllabus for authorized AT and specific guidelines.
     7.4.1. BIT. A BIT occurs when a specified lapse in time exists between live controlling
     events within a specific phase or block of training (MU-2, high performance, air-to-air
     refueling, etc.) and may require an additional (ADD) mission to ensure the student is
     prepared to proceed to the next live control event in the syllabus.
        7.4.1.1. Seven Calendar Days BIT. The squadron DO will assess the student’s training
        progress prior to proceeding to the next graded event and determine if an ADD mission is
        justified. Justification will be based on training events the student has accomplished since
        last live event (simulation, chalk talks, etc). The ADD event may be a simulated or live
        mission.
        7.4.1.2. Fourteen Calendar Days BIT. The student will control a live event ADD
        mission prior to proceeding to the next graded event.
        7.4.1.3. Training Event Documentation. Training events will be documented as an
        ADD mission on the student activity log and student grade sheet (AETC Form 186). The
        grade sheet will document, at a minimum, student feedback and ADD mission
        justification. The student will be monitored by an approved instructor for the block of
        training.
AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 25


       7.4.1.4. Example. Student last controlled a live mission on Monday. Student has until
       the close of flying operations on the following Monday to control another live mission.
       On Tuesday, the student would be in a BIT scenario.
   7.4.2. Reinstatement by CR. AT may be authorized for students reinstated into training
   after a CR.
   7.4.3. International Students. These sorties or training events are authorized as outlined in
   the individual syllabus for international students who may not be able to meet standards
   because of such factors as language or cultural differences. Whenever possible, these sorties
   or training events should be scheduled so a PC or EC is not required.
7.5. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Briefings. AFI 11290, Cockpit/Crew Resource
Management Training Program, and its AETC Sup 1 outline requirements for the CRM training
program. CRM briefings discuss human-factor causes in aircraft mishaps. While in live flying
training, instructors will brief and debrief to CRM contracts and concepts.
7.6. Mission Briefings. These briefings set the tone for the mission and cover specific
objectives and mission accomplishment. Discuss techniques and procedures for flying the
mission before or after the mission briefing. An instructor briefs undergraduate students prior to
all missions. Post-mission debriefings measure the success in accomplishing the mission
objectives.
7.7. Incomplete Sorties:
   7.7.1. FLT/CC or supervisor (based on the recommendation of the instructor) determines if a
   sortie is incomplete. Evaluate each situation on an individual basis. If a student has had
   ample opportunity to learn a task and subsequently accomplishes a short mission; do not
   consider the mission incomplete solely to provide unwarranted additional training. Do not
   consider the mission incomplete solely based on an individual lesson that can be
   accomplished on the next mission without degrading accomplishment of future training
   objectives.
   7.7.2. Consider the effect of the mission on the quality of the student’s training and each
   student’s prior training opportunities as well as the remaining sorties available to accomplish
   training objectives. The syllabus provides a means for AT for students who do not progress
   to the end of unit proficiency requirements. Above-average students are entitled to the same
   training opportunities to refine their skills as below-average students.
7.8. Grading Procedures. There are two methods of grading student performance—an absolute
grading scale for rating individual items and a relative grading scale for assessing overall sortie
performance. Grading criteria will be IAW the applicable syllabus. Refer to the applicable
syllabus for further guidance.
7.9. Academic Examinations. HQ AETC/A3Z is the OPR for flying training academic course
examinations. The minimum passing score is 85 percent unless otherwise noted. A course-
qualified academic instructor administers all examinations. During examinations, instructors
only answer questions to clarify the meaning of questions on the exam. Instructors should avoid
answering in a manner that changes students’ confidence in an answer or directs a path for
problem resolution. Anything said to one student should be shared with the entire class.

7.10. Wash Back. Students may wash back from one class to another based on medical issues
or extenuating circumstances. When a student washes back for these purposes, the SQ/CC is the
approving authority for determining the appropriate class in the syllabus to continue the student’s
training. Wash-backs are not a corrective tool for performance based student deficiencies.
Students experiencing difficulty progressing in the training syllabus will be handled IAW the
commander’s review process (CRP). Reinstatement resides with the CRP approval authority.
AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               27


                                           Chapter 8

                   UNDERGRADUATE INTERNATIONAL TRAINING

8.1. International Military Student (IMS) Training. IMSs receive Air Force formal course
training under the International Military Education and Training Program, a foreign military
sales case, a counter-drug program, or as part of a presidential drawdown initiative. These
activities are part of the Department of Defense (DoD) SATP. The administration of SATP
students generally adheres to the procedures outlined in the preceding chapters, but there are
certain exceptions. This chapter addresses only those areas where SATP student administration
differs from Air Force student administration. See Chapter 1 through Chapter 7 for procedures
for areas not covered in this chapter. Follow guidance in AFI 16-501 for the requirements in
paragraph 8.2 through paragraph 8.8.
8.2. International Military Student Officer (IMSO). Each Air Force installation appoints an
IMSO to handle administrative affairs. Training units conducting security assistance training, to
include orientations, must maintain a close liaison with their installation IMSO.
8.3. Training Administration. AFSAT administers all international technical, flying,
professional military education, and BMT within AETC. Units send questions about
administrative procedures to the installation IMSO who, in turn, notifies the appropriate AFSAT
country manager. Refer to AFI 16105 for terms, references, and additional information about
SATP.
8.4. Student Data Screening. Training units screen student records as outlined in AFI 16105.
The installation IMSO conducts a thorough review of the student’s invitational travel order
(ITO) and appropriate amendments.
8.5. Substandard Performance:
   8.5.1. 19 AF/DO and the AFSAT country manager must approve AT sorties required beyond
   the syllabus limit. The unit IMSO should contact the appropriate AFSAT country manager to
   obtain country approval.
   8.5.2. If a student’s actual flying abilities do not meet standards and elimination is
   recommended, the unit OG/CC notifies the installation IMSO, AFSAT/TO, and 19 AF/DO.
8.6. Student Training Records. The 325 ACS IMSO maintains international controller student
training records.
8.7. Completion of Forms. The US Security Assistance Office (SAO) from the IMS’s country
assigns a student training number, also called the worksheet control number (WCN). This
student training number (or WCN) is the last four digits of the student’s ITO number, and is
student specific. Reference this number in correspondence with the student’s country, AFSAT,
IMSOs, and SAOs.
8.8. Training Summary:
   8.8.1. DD Form 2496, International Student Academic Report, is used for the training
   summary. Note: The base IMSO assists training units to complete required forms.
28                                                   AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010


     8.8.2. Record awards, special certificates, or other achievements after the course summary
     section. The training unit attaches a copy of award citations, letters of appreciation,
     certificates, etc., to the training summary. The installation IMSO is responsible for
     complying with AFI 16105. The training unit ensures the IMSO is aware when special
     awards of citations accompany the training summary.
8.9. Holiday Scheduling. All international military students may be authorized an additional 2
days each year to observe national and/or religious holidays. Coordinate specific days for each
country through AFSAT and the IMSO.
AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                29

                      UABMT STUDENT ASSIGNMENT PROCESS

9.1. Overview:
   9.1.1. Students receive assignments based on their class ranking measured against their peers
   in the area of academics, positional performance, and leadership.
   9.1.2. The 325 ACS/CC is the final approving authority for assignment distribution among
   the UABMT available bases.
9.2. Career Information:
   9.2.1. The 325 ACS provides students with specific career information. This information
   should help students make informed choices when requesting specific weapon systems
   and/or base preferences. Specific information should include mission duties, career path,
   advancement opportunities, and average TDY commitments.
   9.2.2. UABMT students make their career requests on AF IMT 3849,
   PME/AFIT/RTFB/Officer Worksheet, or suitable substitute. Attachment 4 is a sample AF
   IMT 3849. (AF IMT 3849 is prescribed by AFI 362611, Officer Professional Development.
   Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.) Note: Direct students with
   special-need dependents or circumstances to make these situations known to their chain of
   command.
9.3. Merit Assignment Selection System:
   9.3.1. At the beginning of each class, instructors or appropriate squadron representatives will
   present an overall assignment system briefing. All students in the class should be present at
   this briefing to ensure they understand the MASS methodology and can subsequently brief
   any student who is unavoidably absent.
   9.3.2. A rating is assigned to each student using MASS criteria. This rating is an overall
   assessment of the student’s airmanship, capability, officership, and potential. It includes the
   class CC assessment of a student’s ability to complete follow-on training, positional
   performance, officership, leadership, teamwork, and attitude. Class CCs consider every facet
   of a student’s training when assigning ratings; officership (bearing, discipline, punctuality,
   etc.) is not the sole basis for assigning this rating.
9.4. UABMT Student Assignment Process:
   9.4.1. Merit Order Calculation. Each class CC computes the academic and positional
   performance merit order for all students using the assignment matrix provided by the 325
   ACS Registrar. Each class commander also ranks assigned students using the class CC
   ranking matrix included in the assignment matrix. Merge academic and positional
   performance merit order and Class CC ranking matrix, producing a class standing by total
   point score (no ties).
   9.4.2. Assignment Procedures:
30                                                   AETCI36-2205V9 23 FEBRUARY 2010


       9.4.2.1. Prior to assignment, each student completes AF IMT 3849, Part II, to indicate a
       preference order of available assignments. Class CCs should make notes regarding
       student performance or other factors which may affect their assignment.
       9.4.2.2. Class CC completes and forwards student assignment recommendations up the
       chain for 325 ACS/CC approval. Class CC:
          9.4.2.2.1. Ranks students in merit order utilizing the assignment matrix.
          9.4.2.2.2. Ensures the top 10 percent of graduates receive their first choice, if
          available. For example, in a class of 15 students, the top 10 percent would be 1.5
          students. Round fractional numbers to the next highest whole number, making the top
          10 percent (in this example) 2 students.
          9.4.2.2.3. Continues with the rank order listing using the student’s AF IMT 3849, and
          provides the best match of the student’s skills, potential, desires, and available
          assignment quotas. Students receive their first choice of an assignment if it is
          available.
          9.4.2.2.4. Goes to the second (third, etc.) choice if the student’s first choice is not
          available or the student is not recommended for that track by the 325 ACS/CC. If that
          assignment is available and the student is recommended, places the student in that
          assignment.
       9.4.2.3. The 325 ACS Registrar will send the commander’s assignment recommendation
       to HQ AFPC/DPAOT within 10 duty days after final approval.

9.5. Prescribed Forms:
