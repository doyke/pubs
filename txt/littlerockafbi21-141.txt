This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. This instruction applies to
all 19th Airlift Wing (19 AW) aircraft maintenance organizations. This instruction also applies
to 314 Airlift Wing (314 AW) units whose aircraft are inducted into the 19th Equipment
Maintenance Squadron (19 EMS) isochronal inspection flow cycle. This instruction does not
apply to Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve Units. This instruction establishes guidelines,
procedures, and responsibilities for control, development, and use of locally developed
forms/lists, preprints, and job flow packages used to record maintenance tasks. NOTE: 314
Airlift Wing units will utilize AFI 21-101_AETCSUP1, Maintenance Management Policy with
the following exception: 314 AW units whose aircraft are inducted into the 19 EMS isochronal
inspection flow cycle, will utilize 19 AW work packages. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

No significant changes from LRAFBI 21-141, dated 22 April 11.


1. General. This plan was developed using Air Force principles to ensure compliance with
applicable directives AFI 33-360, Volume 2, AFI 21-101_AMCSUP1, and TO 00-20-1.
2. Quality Process. Quality process ensures whatever is produced meets or exceeds all
technical specifications, local policies, and other written directives.
3. Terms Explained. The following terms are defined as they apply to this instruction.
     3.1. Locally Developed Forms/Lists. Forms or lists produced locally to record recurring
     maintenance tasks or collect maintenance data and information. Examples may include:
     access panel sheets and inspection discrepancy sheets used during scheduled inspections,
     time compliance technical orders, or extensive recurring maintenance.
     3.2. Pre-prints These are existing aircraft, trainer, or support equipment (SE) forms
     overprinted to record recurring maintenance tasks. Preprinted manual aircraft forms are not
     authorized for use in units with an available automated management system (i.e., CAMS or
     G081); however, units may create job flow packages in the automated management system.
     When an automated system is not available, manual methods will be used in conjunction
     with manuals or directives to the greatest extent possible. Data collected manually should be
     in such detail that automated systems may be updated, when practical.
     3.3. Job Flow Packages. Job flow packages developed using the automated management
     system and loaded are printed when needed to automate required documentation of repetitive
     complex tasks; such as, engine change, isochronal inspection, and flight control maintenance.
     As a minimum, any Red X symbol condition generated during the performance of an
     inspection will be entered into the automated maintenance management system.
4. Responsibilities.
     4.1. Initiator will:
         4.1.1. Submit all proposed locally developed preprints, forms/lists, and job flow
         packages to the 19 MXG Quality Assurance (QA) office using locally developed
         preprints, forms/list, and Preprint Authorization Letter (Attachment 2) for coordination
         and approval. Proposals must be properly coordinated within the initiator’s squadron and
         routed through maintenance supervision. 314th units will utilize their quality assurance
         office to submit locally developed preprints, forms/lists, and job flow packages for
         approval and control.
         4.1.2. Submit all change proposals on a 19 MXG/QA Form 114, Recommended
         Changes To Work Package (Attachment 3), and include a copy of current work package
         with pen and ink changes.
     4.2. Squadron Maintenance Supervision will:
         4.2.1. Ensure locally developed preprints, forms/lists, and job flow packages have been
         reviewed for content, accuracy, necessity, and compliance with applicable directives.
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-141 3 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                        3


     4.2.2. Ensure locally developed preprints, forms/lists, and job flow packages are used for
     their intended purpose, documented in accordance with applicable directives filed, or
     disposed of as required.
     4.2.3. Coordinate with the applicable 19 MXG/QA for deletion of any locally developed
     preprints, forms/lists, and job flow packages.
  4.3. 19 MXG/QA Office will:
     4.3.1. Ensure submitting squadron maintenance supervision has reviewed all proposals.
     4.3.2. Ensure proposed locally developed preprints, forms/lists, and job flow packages
     do not duplicate or replace existing preprints, forms/lists, or job flow packages.
     4.3.3. Ensure locally developed preprints and forms/lists have a date on each page so the
     previous version can be easily identified and purged.
     4.3.4. Approve/disapprove and assign control numbers to each approved locally
     developed preprint and forms/lists.
     4.3.5. Route and coordinate with 19 MOS Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation
     (P,S&D) to have the most current and approved job flow packages updated in the G081
     database.
     4.3.6. Maintain a master file copy of approved locally developed preprints and
     forms/lists used within the maintenance complex until the next review.
     4.3.7. Coordinate annual reviews with squadrons and update or delete preprints,
     forms/lists, and job flow packages as required.
  4.4. 19 MOS PS&D will:
     4.4.1. Ensure QA and initiating squadron supervision review proposed changes and
     deletions to job flow packages before they are loaded into G081.
     4.4.2. Combine like packages used by multiple AMUs whenever possible.
     4.4.3. As a minimum, coordinate with all AMUs, Debrief and QA annually for review of
     all 19 AW work packages.
     4.4.4. Upon completion of the annual review, make updates and changes as needed in
     G081.
     4.4.5. Ensure approved changes to work packages are input into G081 within 7 duty days
     of receipt of approval.
     4.4.6. Limit access to G081 screen 9004 to schedulers only.
