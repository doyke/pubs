                               VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The vehicle categories described in the following
paragraphs align with DoD and recognized national and consensus standards. The intent of this
chapter is to assist commanders in developing local traffic codes and to identify minimum safety
standards for government and non-government motor vehicles and motorized transportation
devices. Transportation of munitions/explosives must comply with AFMAN 91-201, Explosives
Safety Standards.
2.2. Government Owned, Leased, and Rented Vehicles.
   2.2.1. Government Motor Vehicles (GMV). Commercial design vehicles which are
   purchased, leased or rented by the Air Force for use in the United States and U.S. territories
   and possessions shall meet all applicable requirements of 49 CFR 571, Federal Motor
   Vehicle Safety Standards (latest edition), and Public Law No 99-570, Commercial Motor
   Vehicle Safety Act of 1986.
       2.2.1.1. Commercial design vehicles of foreign manufacture purchased, leased or rented
       for use outside the United States and U.S. territories and possessions shall meet all
       applicable safety requirements of the country in which they are to be used. Every effort
       shall be made to procure or lease vehicles equipped with air bags (preferably for both
       driver and passenger).
       2.2.1.2. Where available, as a procurement option, equip government-owned or leased
       commercial design vehicles at high risk of mishaps, mechanical failure or abuse with
       safety monitoring devices (e.g., remote tracking and diagnostic monitoring systems) to

     requirements when authorized to be used off installations. Additional requirements for
     these vehicles are contained in AFI 23-302, Vehicle Management.
  2.2.4. Government Motorcycles and All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV). Mandatory safety
  equipment and training are addressed in paragraphs 3.4 and 4.5.8; additional requirements
  are listed in paragraph 2.2.5 for off-road motorcycles or ATVs.
  2.2.5. Government Off-Road Vehicles. This includes Government Owned Recreational
  Motor Vehicles (GORMVs) also known as Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances
  (OGMVC). Commanders will limit use of these vehicles to off-road areas and tactical
  operations as much as possible. The installation commander may authorize the use of these
  vehicles in traffic, industrial or pedestrian environments by type, design and authorized
  operating areas. Additional related requirements are located in AFI 23-302.
     2.2.5.1. The use of seatbelts, ROPS and other safety features are necessary for the safety
     of operators, passengers, bystanders, and preservation of the equipment. Purchasing
     authorities and end-users of government off-road vehicles will ensure applicable safety
     devices and features are installed, maintained and used.
     2.2.5.2. Government Off-Road Motorcycles and All-Terrain Vehicles. Mandatory safety
     requirements are addressed in paragraph 3.4.2
     2.2.5.3. Risk Management (RM) Evaluation. When government off-road vehicles are
     authorized to be used in traffic, industrial, or pedestrian environments, owning
     organizations will complete a written RM evaluation, unless time critical, before
     authorizing any on-installation use of government owned or privately owned RMV in
     traffic, industrial, or pedestrian environments.            Applicable manufacturer
     recommendations, manuals, local, state, or host nation requirements will be considered

                                           Chapter 3

                   PROGRAM AND INDIVIDUAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Overview. The following paragraphs describe safety requirements applicable to vehicle
operators, passengers, bicyclists, and pedestrians. This includes those operating all motorized
and non-motorized transportation unless otherwise exempted elsewhere in this Instruction.
3.2. Operator Distractions.
   3.2.1. The use of headphones, earphones and cellular telephones hinders or prevents
   recognition of emergency signals, alarms, announcements, approach of vehicles, human
   speech and the ability to determine the direction from which sounds are coming. Vehicle
   operators must comply with applicable federal, state, local and host nation laws that are more
   stringent than this guidance regarding distractions while driving (e.g., using cellular phones,
   text messaging).
   3.2.2. All persons listed in paragraphs 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, while operating a government motor
   vehicle, operating a PMV on official government business or utilizing a government owned
   electronic device are prohibited from text messaging on or off a DOD installation. Using cell
   phones, any listening device or other hand-held electronic devices, that takes attention away
   from driving is discouraged unless the vehicle is safely parked, off the roadway or they are
   using a single ear bud or voice-activated hands-free device, where allowed by law. Use of
   hands-free devices is also discouraged as they create significant distractions from safe
   driving performance.
       3.2.2.1. Exceptions are motorcycle operator/passenger intercom devices, where allowed
       by law and for receiving or placing calls in the performance of duties from tactical or
       emergency vehicles or other mission critical duties, to include law enforcement use of in-
       car mobile data terminals and other in-car electronic devices.
       3.2.2.2. A Land Mobile Radio (LMR) is primarily a listening device and is not restricted.
       Cellular phones and other devices, used only in push-to-talk (walkie-talkie, direct
       connection) mode are considered LMR, if required and issued for the performance of
       official duties.
   3.2.3. All persons while driving any vehicle are prohibited from using Government-supplied
   electronic equipment for text messaging or other hand-held uses unless the vehicle is safely
   parked or they are using a single ear bud or voice-activated hands-free device, except as
   outlined in paragraph 3.2.2
   3.2.4. Cellular Phone Free School Zone. All installations having school and child
   development centers are highly encouraged to establish a cellular phone free (including
   hands free devices) school zone IAW applicable federal, state, local and host nation laws.
3.3. Duty Related Operator Driving Time.
   3.3.1. Duty Hour Limits. Commanders will establish and enforce duty hour limits for
   operators of motor vehicles to reduce the potential for traffic mishaps caused by operator
   fatigue.

   3.3.2. Directed Travel. Follow the guidance for directed travel contained in the Joint Federal
   Travel Regulation (JFTR), Volume 1. Additional information on official travel distances can
   be found in Joint Federal Travel Regulations (https://dtod.sddc.army.mil/default.aspx).
   3.3.3. Risk Management. To reduce the potential for traffic mishaps caused by operator
   fatigue; commanders, supervisors and all personnel listed in paragraph 1.1.1 through 1.1.3
   will apply a written RM evaluation (see Attachment 3), unless time critical, to assess the
   risks, establish operating procedures, applying supervision, and other controls to mitigate
   risks. This applies to missions exceeding a singular shift or duty day, risk assessments
   include, but not limited to, time on duty, operator’s physical condition, driving conditions,
   and length of travel. Recommended guidelines are contained in Attachment 3.
3.4. Operator and Passenger Protection.
   3.4.1. Seat Belts and Occupant Restraints.
      3.4.1.1. All persons listed in paragraph 1.1 while operating or riding in or on motor
      vehicles, shall properly use installed seat belts, child restraint system or booster seat as
      prescribed by the manufacturer. Child restraint seat systems/booster seats should be
      placed in the back seat and center of vehicle when possible. Individuals shall not ride in
      seating positions where safety belts have not been installed, have been removed or have
      been rendered inoperative.
          3.4.1.1.1. This does not apply to vehicles not designed for seat belts such as buses,
          some off-road motor vehicles, combat/tactical vehicles not designed with belts, or
          vehicles with a manufactured year of 1966 or earlier. Nothing in this section will
          require seatbelt installation into these vehicles unless mandated by applicable host
          nation, state, or territory laws. Occupants are required to wear seatbelts if they have
          been installed in the vehicle.
          3.4.1.1.2. Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) on-duty agents and
          augmentees to the AFOSI, not driving, but performing protective services operations
          (see glossary) are exempt and will use seat belts at their discretion.
      3.4.1.2. To the maximum extent possible, vehicle occupants shall not ride in areas of a
      vehicle without fixed seats. Upon completion of a written RM evaluation, unless time
      critical, and approval by the unit commander, for duty operations only, personnel may be
      transported in vehicles without fixed seats. Transport is limited to short distances on DoD
      installations only, if each passenger remains seated wholly within the body of the vehicle
      all installed seat belts are in use, the vehicle cargo area has no open sides, and no person
      is resting against a side area or gate that may open.
      3.4.1.3. Government Vehicles. A vehicle seat belt retrofit kit will be purchased and
      installed if the vehicle manufacturer develops one for a government vehicle which
      originally did not have seat belts or where seat belts were erroneously removed. Seatbelts
      will be installed in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. Exempt from this rule are
      combat/tactical vehicles where a DoD component has decided occupant protection
      requirements are not appropriate in designated occupant positions, and vehicles that do
      not require seat belts such as the passenger seats in buses.

     3.4.1.4. The operator of any vehicle is responsible for informing all passengers of
     applicable seat belt, child safety seat and PPE requirements of this Instruction. It is the
     senior occupant's responsibility to ensure enforcement of occupant restraints; all persons
     are to be properly secured prior to placing the vehicle in motion. If the senior occupant
     cannot be determined, the driver shall be responsible for enforcement.
     3.4.1.5. Seat belts shall be maintained in a serviceable condition and shall be readily
     available for driver and passenger(s) use.
  3.4.2. Requirements for Motorcycle and ATV Operation. The following requirements apply
  to all persons as listed in paragraph 1.1 while operating or riding as a passenger on a
  motorcycle, ATV or three-wheeled vehicle. When military mission tactics, techniques and
  procedures conflict with these requirements, a user developed RM analysis will be used to
  determine the most appropriate balance of mission and safety. When non-compliance is
  found necessary due to military mission, these actions will be documented and approved by
  the center, wing, installation or equivalent commander. Installation/MAJCOM specific PPE
  requirements may not be used as criterion to deny access to any visiting person whose
  equipment meets the requirements of this section. AF specific PPE requirements mandated
  by this Instruction may not be used as a criterion for limiting access to an AF installation for
  any other military component member or visitor who’s PPE meets the requirements of DoDI
  6055.04.
     3.4.2.1. Headlights (when equipped). All motorcycles, mopeds, motor scooters, three
     wheeled vehicles and ATVs will have headlights turned on at all times when operating on
     a DoD installation on or off road, except where prohibited during military mission or by
     state, local or host nation law.
     3.4.2.2. Passengers. Passengers are not authorized on government owned motorcycles,
     ATVs or three-wheeled vehicles unless they are specifically designed (as determined by
     the manufacturer) to carry a passenger and there is a valid operational need for the
     passenger to ride with the operator.
     3.4.2.3. Personal Protective Equipment. Motorcycle, ATV and Three-Wheeled vehicle
     riders will wear:
         3.4.2.3.1. Head Protection. A helmet, certified to meet current Federal Motor Vehicle

         (UNECE) Standard 22.05, British Standard 6658 or Snell Standard M2005 shall be
         worn and properly fastened under the chin. For personnel riding motorcycles and
         ATVs outside the United States, helmets must meet the host nation standards. In
         those instances where the host has no standard, helmets must, at a minimum, meet the
         Federal Motor Vehicle Safety standard. Commanders may authorize use of combat
         helmets for operating tactical vehicles (e.g., motorcycles and ATVs) during
         operations and training based on a RM evaluation.
         3.4.2.3.2. Eye Protection. Goggles, wrap around glasses, or a full-face shield
         (properly attached to helmet) designed to meet or exceed American National
         Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z87.1, or UNECE 22.05 or BS6658 for impact
         and shatter resistance will be worn and properly used. A windshield does not

        requirements may dictate limited compliance.
     3.4.2.4. Garment and Motorcycle Visibility. A motorcycle rider who is conspicuous to
     other vehicle operators is less likely to be involved in a vehicle to vehicle collision.
     Motorcycle riders will choose riding apparel as upper garments that incorporate high
     visibility colors (e.g. fluorescent yellow-green, fluorescent orange-red or fluorescent red,
     etc.) during the day and a retro-reflective upper garment during the night. Outer upper
     garment shall be visible and not covered. Wearing a backpack is authorized if it has high
     visibility colors/high visibility reflective properties or does not obscure the high visibility
     and reflectivity of the rider’s upper garment. Additionally, riders are encouraged to use
     other methods of increasing conspicuity such as headlight and brake light modulators,
     auxiliary running lights, reflective tape to the sides of your motorcycle and installation of
     position/marker lights.
     3.4.2.5. Off-Road Vehicle Ranges. If an installation has an off-road vehicle range open
     to the public, operators of privately owned motorcycles, ATVs or three-wheelers must

           GUIDELINES FOR CREW REST AND OPERATOR DUTY TIME

A3.1. DUTY HOUR LIMITS. Establish and enforce duty hour limits for GMV operators to
reduce the potential for traffic mishaps caused by operator fatigue.
A3.2. DIRECTED TRAVEL. Follow the guidance for directed travel contained in the Joint
Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Volume 1 (Reference (ac)).
   A3.2.1. The JFTR generally allows 1 day of travel time by motor vehicle for each 350 miles
   of official distance of ordered travel.
   A3.2.2. Drivers shall take rest breaks of at least 15 minutes every 2 to 3 hours of driving or
   every 100 to 150 miles, whichever occurs first. These breaks are in addition to regular meal
   breaks.
A3.3. RISK MANAGEMENT. Apply risk management principles to assessing the risks,
establishing operating procedures, and applying supervision and other controls to enforce risk
controls. Risk assessments include consideration of such risk factors as time on duty, the
operator’s physical condition, driving conditions, and length of travel. The following are
guidelines for reducing the risk of mishaps from fatigue.
   A3.3.1. Rest. Provide operators the opportunity for 8 consecutive hours of rest during any
   24-hour period.
   A3.3.2. Pre-Travel. Preceding a prolonged work or duty period, provide operators a 12-hour
   period that is as free of duties as possible and, ideally, have it spent sleeping.
   A3.3.3. Duty Period. Limit operators to driving no more than 10 hours in a duty period.
   A3.3.4. Alternative Considerations. Provide fatigued personnel alternate means of
   transportation or designated rest stops until they are sufficiently rested to operate a motor
   vehicle or plan for relief drivers.
   A3.3.5. Driving at Night. To the maximum extent possible, schedule driving for daylight
   periods. When traveling during hours of darkness, consider providing a second awake person
   in the vehicle cab or reducing the scheduled driving time.
