                   CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN

Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support
resources and minimum core task requirements for this special duty identifier (SDI). The CFETP
will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of special
duty training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan,
manage and control training within the SDI.

2.1Part I provides information necessary for overall management of training in the SDI. Section
A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies SDI progression information,
duties and responsibilities, training strategies and SDI path; Section C illustrates SDI training
requirements; Section D indicates resource constraints such as funding, manpower, equipment
and facilities.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS)
and includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support training. Sections B, C and D are
not used.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this SDI receive effective
and efficient training. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and
conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.




                                                   1
                               Abbreviations/Terms Explained

Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM) - Individual on the Air Staff charged with the
responsibility for overseeing all training and career field management aspects of an Air Force
specialty or group of specialties.

Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) - A combination of numbers and alpha characters used to
identify an Air Force specialty. Enlisted AFSCs consist of five characters.

Career Field Education Training Plan (CFETP) - A CFETP is a comprehensive, multipurpose
document encapsulating the entire spectrum of training for a career field or SDI. It outlines a
logical growth plan that includes training resources and is designed to make career field or SDI
training identifiable, to eliminate duplication, and to ensure this training is budget defensible.

Core Task - Tasks the AFCFM identifies as a minimum qualification requirement within an
AFSC, regardless of duty position.

Facility Manager OJT Instructor - Instructor who provides qualification, recurring and
remedial training of management tasks.

Group Superintendent MAF Management - Responsible to the group commander for ensuring
quality MAF management, training and evaluation programs.

Initial Training - Required for performing FM duties; normally completed on base.

Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) - Minuteman III missile weapon system.

Missile Alert Facility (MAF) - Provides lodging, protection, and a controlled environment for
launch control operation personnel and equipment.

Missile Alert Facility Manager (FM) - SDI personnel who manage the MAF. Directly
responsible to the MAF NCOIC and flight commander for the effective performance of the MAF
management tasks.

Missile Squadron - Unit FMs are assigned to.

Noncommissioned Officer in Charge MAF (NCOIC) - FM responsible for the effective
management, supervision and training of assigned MAF managers.

On-The-Job Training (OJT) - Hands-on, over-the-shoulder training conducted to certify
personnel in job qualification (duty position certification) training.

Operations Group (OG) - Group missile squadrons are assigned to.




                                                2
Operations Support Squadron (OSS) - The unit the missile alert facility manager training
instructor is assigned to.

Qualification Training - Task training provided through OJT at the MAF.

Resource Constraints - Resource deficiencies, such as money, facilities, time, manpower and
equipment that preclude training from being delivered.

Special Duty Identifier (SDI) - A four or five-digit code and title used to identify manpower
positions and persons performing duties not clearly within a specific career field.

Specialty Training Standard (STS) - An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force
specialty/SDI in terms of task and knowledge which an individual in that specialty may be
expected to perform or to know how on the job, and identifies the training provided to achieve a
3-, 5-, and 7-skill level with an enlisted AFS. It further serves as a contract between AETC and
the functional user to show which of the overall training requirements for an Air Force specialty
code (AFSC) are taught in formal schools and correspondence courses.

Squadron Superintendent - Person assigned as single point of contact within each missile
squadron concerning MAF management issues.

Standard - An exact value, a physical entity, or an abstract concept, established and defined by
authority, custom, or common consent to serve as a reference, model, or rule in measuring
quantities or qualities, establishing practices or procedures, evaluating results. A fixed quantity
or quality.

Trainer - A trained, certified person who teaches personnel to perform certain tasks through
OJT methods or equipment that the trainer uses to teach personnel specified tasks.


Training Business Area (TBA) - an AF Portal-driven automated tool used to manage, track, and
document training. TBA replaces traditional paper-based training records (AF Form 623) for
logistics AFSCs and the Integrated Maintenance Data System (for communications AFSCs
only), as the standard tool to track and manage training.

Training/Technical Reference (TR) - Any documentation used to support training.




                                                 3
Section A – GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Purpose.

1.1. This CFETP provides information that SDI functional managers, training managers,
commanders, supervisors and trainers use to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and
efficient SDI training program. The plan standardizes training for all facility managers. This
CFETP accurately reflects what is necessary for facility manager (FM) qualification training to
prepare for missile alert facility duties. This plan does not address ancillary training. The CFETP
has several purposes:

1.1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage and conduct a SDI training
program. Establishes baseline training requirements for initial qualification for SDI 8S000
duties.

1.1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for performing facility manager and
support duties.

1.1.3. Identifies progression opportunities within the FM SDI and describes the duty
requirements for each major position within the SDI.

1.1.4. Identifies the requirements for attending professional development.

1.1.5. Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired SDI
program.

2. Uses.

2.1. This plan is used by managers in all FM programs to ensure comprehensive, standardized
training programs which develop qualified FMs able to meet the unique requirements of each
facility manager and support position.

2.2. Group Superintendent MAF Management, OSS FM Instructors, and Missile Squadron
Superintendents will ensure their training programs compliment the mandatory facility manager
qualification training requirements.

2.3. OSS FM Instructors will use the CFETP to program training requirements for personnel
engaged in FM OJT training and evaluating facility managers.

2.4. Individual must ensure he/she completes mandatory training requirements specified in this
plan. Part II identifies mandatory training requirements and identifies sources for the required
training.


3. Coordination and Approval.



                                                 4
3.1. 20 AF/A3NV must conduct an annual review of the CFETP and report inadequacies to the
AFCFM through AFGSC/A3I no later than 45 days prior to the anniversary date of the CFETP
(as printed in the upper right corner of the CFETP). Negative replies are required. AFGSC/A3I
will consolidate inputs for submission to the AFCFM.

3.2. AFCFM will serve as the OPR for the CFETP. 20 AF/A3NV will host U&TW as directed by
the AFCFM, to determine 8S000 training requirements and revise and/or develop an effective
CFETP. AFGSC/A3I will maintain the CFETP, suggest necessary revisions and submit new or
revised CFETP versions to the AFCFM for action. AFGSC/A3I will conduct an annual review
within 45 days of the anniversary date of the CFETP to ensure accuracy and relevancy and to
incorporate any changes provided by the Facility Manager community.

3.3. The AFCFM, by letter, has delegated the authority to review and coordinate the CFETP to
AFGSC/A3I. The AFCFM will request AFGSC/A3I conduct a U&TW when it appears major
revision or replacement of the CFETP is necessary to meet mission requirements. Upon approval
by the AFCFM, AFGSC/A3I will publish, issue, announce and index the CFETP in accordance
with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.




                                               5
Section B – Facility Manager Opportunities and Information

4. Specialty Descriptions.

4.1. The purpose of this section is to identify opportunities and duty positions within the Facility
Manager SDI 8S000. By evaluation of what is available and the specific demands of each
position, NCOs can decide: (1) if they want to apply for FM duty and/or (2) where they would
like to be assigned.

4.2. Unlike “typical” career fields such as security forces, maintenance or supply, a career
progression ladder does not exist for the FM SDI 8S000. Since individual’s perceptions and
values control how we see a particular move within facility management, rather than a
systematic evolution of training and experience, it is impossible to identify a standardized or
typical career path an 8S000 might follow as they progress within the SDI. “Opportunities” are
functionally organized in three basic areas: management, facility managers and support.

4.3. FM positions (management, facility managers, and support) are controlled duty tours. Tour
length is standardized at 4 years. Special duty tour extensions are requested and approved on a
case-by-case basis by AFGSC/A3I.

4.4. FM Duty Titles and Job Descriptions. Note: The duty titles Operations Superintendent,
Superintendent MAF Operations and Group Superintendent MAF Management are reserved for
specific positions and are not authorized for general use as optional duty titles. The following
duty titles and their accompanying job descriptions are intended to describe positions available
throughout the 8S000 SDI for those performing like duties. The duty description, not the title,
may be modified to meet the unique local conditions and/or additional duties. These examples
are provided merely as illustrations and are not intended to limit a commander’s/superintendent’s
authority to clearly identify duty requirements within an operational group.

5. Community College of the Air Force. A degree program does not exist for the 8S000 SDI,
however, individuals are highly encouraged to complete their secondary AFSC degree if not
previously awarded.




                                                7
Section C – 8S000 Training Requirements

6. Facility Manager Training Requirements.

6.1. Although the 8S000 SDI is awarded upon entry into FM special duty, certain training
requirements must be met by all 8S000 personnel to be considered fully qualified. To ensure
individuals are properly prepared for MAF management duty they are required to complete a
two-phase training program. The first phase is indoctrination training and the second phase is
task qualification training. The first phase is normally provided by the OSS FM instructor (i.e.,
MAF safety, CPR) or an outside agency (i.e., fuels management, weather) and includes ancillary
training. The second phase provides OJT on MAF management tasks listed in the STS.
Indoctrination and task qualification training are two separate, yet simultaneous requirements
each FM must successfully complete. Indoctrination training will normally be completed before
task qualification training is started. Facility managers may not perform unsupervised MAF
management duties until they have completed both phases of training.

6.2. A detailed list of initial and qualification training requirements can be found in AFGSCI 10-
204, Missile Alert Facility Management.

6.3. Selection Criteria

6.3.1. This section establishes broad policy guidelines for those involved in recruiting and
selecting individuals for Facility Manager duty. Its purpose is to ensure that only the highest
quality candidates, who meet mission essential criteria, are selected for FM duty. It identifies
mandatory requirements for 8S000 duties and desirable qualifications, which should be
considered when screening FM applicants.

6.3.2. The mandatory hiring practices apply to all 8S000 managers engaged in recruiting,
screening, and selecting personnel for FM duties. The qualifications specified apply to all
potential 8S000s, not just those slated for full-time facility manager positions.

6.3.3. The selection criteria may not be waived locally. Any requests for waivers/deviations from
this policy must be submitted by the unit commander to AFGSC/A3I and approved by AFCFM
or AFPC/DPPAC IAW AFI 36-2101.

6.3.4. Individuals selected for FM duties must meet the following qualifications for entry, award
and retention of the SDI.

6.3.4.1. Must be in the grade of SSgt through MSgt.

6.3.4.2. Must have a skill level commensurate with grade in current AFSC.

6.3.4.3. Must not possess a record of emotional instability disciplinary action or financial
irresponsibility.




                                                 8
6.3.4.4. Must meet requirements for 8S000 SDI entry per Air Force Enlisted Classification
Directory.

6.3.4.4.1. Aptitude - Mechanical 40

6.3.4.4.2. Strength Aptitude Test – 50 lbs

6.3.4.4.3. Physical Profile

6.3.4.5. Must meet PCS eligibility requirements.

6.3.4.6. Must meet current fitness standards.

6.3.4.7. Overall rating of 4 or higher on last five performance reports.

6.3.4.8. Ability to obtain 48 months retainability as of the reporting month.

6.3.4.9. Must be a US citizen and possess a current Secret security clearance.

6.4. Core Task Requirements. SDI 8S000 currently does not have any core or critical tasks.




                                                 9
Section D – Resource Constraints

7. Purpose. This section identifies known resource constraints, which preclude optimal desired
training from being developed or conducted, including information such as funding, manpower,
equipment and facilities. A narrative explanation of resource constraints and an impact statement
describing what effect each constraint has on training is included. Resource constraints will be
reviewed and updated annually.

7.1. General Information: FM duty is a selectively manned special duty requiring 4-year
controlled tours and mandatory training requirements to gain proficiency to be fully qualified.
All training requirements are outlined in this CFETP.

7.2. Constraints:

7.2.1. One limiting factor affecting 8S000 qualification training is manpower availability. Even
though entry into the 8S000 SDI is similar to retraining, currently there is no formal “pipeline”
manning process which allows newly hired facility managers to complete training prior to the
date they are required to begin FM duties. Therefore, unit manning suffers as 8S000s are treated,
for manpower purposes, as fully qualified the day they are assigned. As a result, FM training is
expedited to enable units to meet MAF manning requirements.

7.2.2. AFGSC/A3I must ensure this constraint is a priority with the SDI AFCFM to establish a
“facility manager pipeline” allowing unit manning levels to accommodate facility manager
training. This pipeline must also assign FMs to gaining units far enough in advance of the date
they are required to allow for near completion of training. As a minimum, new FMs should not
be counted against unit manning levels and should be assigned to the gaining unit a minimum of
four weeks prior to their required date of availability. This would allow for completion of initial
and minimal qualification training. The Group Superintendent MAF Management shall ensure
AFGSC/A3I is aware of unit needs. Group Superintendent MAF Management must prepare for
personnel losses well in advance by reviewing manning documents and forwarding projected
losses to AFGSC/A3I.




                                                10
Part II

Section A – Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This Specialty Training Standard (STS) is for use by personnel who possess
SDI 8S000 and is mandatory for those performing MAF FM duties.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

2.1. Provides documented certification for OJT.

2.1.1. Column 1 (Task and Technical Reference) lists the most common tasks and technical
references (TR) necessary for individuals to perform duties in the 8S000 SDI. To identify
additional 8S000 requirements, create an entry or entries in TBA or on an AF Form 797.

2.1.2. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies specific core tasks. SDI 8S000 currently does not have
any core tasks. Column 8 (Certifying Official Initials) is also not used, as only core tasks require
certification.

2.1.3. Column 3 is used to record the date tasks are begun. Column 4 is used to record the date
task training is completed. Column 5 and 6 are where the trainee and trainer initial once task is
completed.

2.2. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form
623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. When used as a JQS, the
following requirements apply:

2.2.1. Documentation. Document and certify training IAW AFI 36-2201.

2.2.1.1. Converting from Old Document to New CFETP. Follow transcription procedures in
the Training Business Area (TBA) Users Guide.

2.2.1.2. Decertification and Recertification. Follow procedures provided in AFI36-2201.

2.2.2. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the GO/NO GO level. GO means
the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy,
timeliness and correct use of procedures.
