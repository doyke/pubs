SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision clarifies verbiage and updates procedures for group and wing leadership informing
the command post of duty status to ensure timely and efficient notifications.
1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. The Chief, 552 ACW/CP will ensure compliance with this instruction.
   1.2. The 552 ACW/CC, 552 ACW/CV, 552 OG/CC/CD, 552 MXG/CC/CD and 552
   ACG/CC/CD will provide contact and current duty status information to the CP as required
   by this instruction.

     1.3. CP will utilize the information provided to maintain current availability status of the
     wing commander, vice wing commander, group commanders and group deputies.
     1.4. CP will submit ACC Commanders Availability Reports IAW AFI 10-206, ACC Sup 1.
2. Status Reporting Procedures.
     2.1. The Wing Commander’s office will provide the CP a projected schedule of availability
     (leave, TDY, etc.) and information as required by AFI 10-206, ACC Sup 1 for Commanders
     Availability Reports (CAR) for the 552 ACW/CC/CV. Group Commanders off
     station/planned availability status should be emailed to the “552 ACW/CP Command Post”
     552acw.cp2@us.af.mil or 552acw.cp@tinker.af.milorganizational account to ensure
     accurate and rapid notification when required.
     2.2. Commanders will ensure CP is promptly notified upon the passing and resumption of
     command of their units to and from another person.
     2.3. Dual Absences. Simultaneous absences of both group commander and deputy group
     commander require wing commander approval. Dual absences are discouraged and should
     not be planned unless absolutely necessary. When unavoidable, the period of overlapping
     absence will be as brief as possible.
3. Notification Procedures.
     3.1. During duty hours, CP will attempt to establish contact with a commander using the
     following devices: mobile phone, duty phone, and then home phone. During non-duty hours,
     CP will attempt to establish contact using mobile and home phones.
     3.2. If necessary, the 552 ACW/CC/CV may direct the CP to maintain rapid two-way
     communication, location, and status of group commanders/deputy commanders. Upon
     initiation, CP will notify all commanders to be “ON BRICK” to establish and maintain
     required connectivity. Commanders are required to maintain a posture that allows CP to
     contact them in one call attempt. When on base, commanders and their deputies will utilize
     Land Mobile Radios (LMR). When changing communications means, such as transitioning
     from LMR to a mobile phone or a home phone, commanders will notify CP prior to the
     change. If LMRs are unavailable, commanders will carry cell phones and provide CP with a
     land- line backup number when possible.
4. LMR Procedures.
     4.1. Primary LMR working frequency for wing and group commanders is the 552 ACW/CC
     net. Use 72 ABW/CC net as a backup when directed by CP. Use Data Encryption Standard
     (DES) to the maximum extent possible unless specifically directed otherwise by 552
     ACW/CC. The 552 ACNS will key all radios required for DES.
     4.2. Call Signs. Use the following call signs for the 552 ACW leadership on both 552
     ACW/CC net and 72 ABW/CC net unless specifically instructed otherwise.
        4.2.1. 552 ACW/CC – SENTRY 1.
        4.2.2. 552 ACW/CV – SENTRY 2.
        4.2.3. 552 OG/CC – SENTRY 3.
        4.2.4. 552 MXG/CC – SENTRY 4.
552ACWI10-301 5 AUGUST 2014                                                               3


     4.2.5. 552 ACG/CC – SEN TRY 5.
     4.2.6. Senior Flying Supervisor (normally 552 OG/CDF) – FOXTROT.
     4.2.7. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) – RAMROD.
     4.2.8. 552 ACW Command Post – COMMAND POST.
  4.3. Call sign suffixes. Use the following call sign suffixes to commander call signs as
  applicable. Groups will set an order of precedence for deputy commander(s). Primary deputy
  commander will use ALPHA suffix (for example, 552 OG/CD will be “SENTRY 3A”).
  Further acting commanders or other positions on the LMR will be followed by additional
  suffixes B,C, etc., to denote order of precedence for the acting commander.
