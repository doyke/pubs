(HAZMART) as well as addressing local purchase procedures. Identifies customer support
sections within the LRS to include accessing customer reports. Addresses procedures for
handling property.
1.3.5.1. Customer Support Section, 20 LRS/LGRMC, is part of the Materiel Management Flight,
20 LRS/LGRM, 321 Cullen St., Room 205, 895-5363/5316/9477/5247. The Customer Support
Section’s duty hours are 0700-1600, Monday through Friday.
1.3.5.2. Retail Sales (Base Service Store, Tool Issue Center, and Individual Equipment) and the
retail portion of HAZMART have been privatized with Lions Club Industries, Inc. (LCI).
Government-Wide Purchase (GPC), formerly referred to as International Merchants Purchase
Authorization Card (IMPAC), cardholders may purchase retail sales and HAZMART items at
the LCI Base Service Center, 321 Cullen St. All hazardous material (HAZMAT) must first be
coordinated through HAZMART, 895-9931/9932/9933, for authorization check to see if the
requested asset is in their free-issue reuse, and redistribution program. Once issued, customers
will coordinate their issue with HAZMART for product bar-coding and entry in the Enterprise
Environmental Safety and Occupational Health – Management Information System (EESOH-
MIS).
1.3.5.3. Demand Processing is part of the Customer Support Section, 20 LRS/LGRMC, 321
Cullen St., Room 205, and is the primary point of contact (POC) to order supplies for non-
aircraft support organizations and items that cannot be procured at LCI. Supply requests for
maintenance activities using Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) are submitted IAW
ACCI 23-251, Combat Oriented Supply Organization (COSO) Policy, Chapter 5. After-hours
support (non-fuel related) is provided by Aircraft Parts Store (APS), 20 LRS/LGRMSA, 895-
1027/1025, from 2300 Sunday through 0700 Monday, 1600 through 0700 Monday through

unused hazardous material to the HAZMART for inclusion in this program. Customers will
coordinate with HAZMART prior to submitting a requisition to LCI or Customer Support
Section for National Stock Numbers (NSNs) identified in Federal Logistics Record (FEDLOG)
with a Hazardous Material Indicator Code (HMIC) of Y which requires the procuring activity to
acquire a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).
1.4. Customer and Logistics Readiness Squadron/Supply Activity Relationships. LRS
customer training is coordinated through LRS Training, 20 LRS/LGLOT, 321 Cullen St., Room

organization refusals that, after research, are not determined to be the fault of the customer or
LRS (i.e., misidentified concealed property, incomplete items, incorrect property, etc.).
Organization refusals determined after research to be in the customer’s fault will not be RVPd.
