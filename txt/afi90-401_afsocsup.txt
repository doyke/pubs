                                RELEASING INFORMATION

1.1. Classified Information. Air Force personnel must properly safeguard classified
information in the interests of national defense (according to DoD 5200.1-R, Department of
Defense Information Security Program Regulation, with Change 1 and AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program Management). In accordance with DoDI 5230.29 and DoDI 5400.04,
Prepared Statements, Transcripts, QFRs, IFRs, Advance Policy Questions, Selected Acquisition
Reports, and Budget Documents will be submitted to the DoD Office of Security Review for
security and policy review with the consent of the Secretary of the Air Force before going to
Congress. The Secretary has designated the Security and Policy Review office (SAF/PA) as the
approval authority for release of Air Force classified information to the Congress. Refer
congressional requests for classified information to SAF/PA through SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL.
Air Force officials may not disclose classified information to the Congress for release to a
congressional constituent.
1.2. "For Official Use Only" Information. According to DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302,
Freedom of Information Act Program, Air Force officials may generally not disclose For Official
Use Only (FOUO) information to the public that falls within exemptions 2 through 9 of the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). However, the Air Force may release such information to
chairpersons or ranking members of congressional committees or subcommittees if the
information relates to matters within their jurisdiction. An Air Force official who decides the
information should not be released to the congressional committee must staff the congressional
request for information with a recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force through
SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL as appropriate. Requests from Members of Congress not seeking
records on behalf of a Congressional Committee, Subcommittee, either House sitting as a whole,
or made on behalf of their constituents shall be considered the same as any other requester.
1.3. Privacy Act Information. Air Force officials must protect personal information about
military and civilian employees according to the guidelines of the Privacy Act. Without an
individual’s written consent to release information, Air Force officials may provide only general
information according to the provisions of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program which sets
forth the Privacy Act procedures. The Air Force may, however, disclose an individual’s records
without the individual’s consent when requested by a chairperson or ranking member of a
congressional committee or subcommittee if the information relates to matters within their
jurisdiction. When making such a disclosure, the Air Force should tell the committee or
subcommittee members about any sensitive information and the need to safeguard it.
1.4. Information for Air Force Personnel. Air Force personnel have the legal right to petition,
furnish information to, or communicate with Congress (Title 5, United States Code, Section 7102
and Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034).
1.5. Locally Sensitive Information. Information on significant changes in the status of Air
Force units, installations, and industrial facilities may have an impact on states and congressional
districts. Therefore, Air Force officials must not release any information governed by AFI 10-
503, Strategic Basing, September 27, 2010, without the proper authorization. For any other
information not governed by AFI-10-503 basing actions concerning changes in status of AF
units, installations, and industrial facilities that might have an impact (positive or negative) on
 6                                              AFI90-401_AFSOCSUP 7 NOVEMBER 2013


the local community/congressional district; local commanders should check with SAF/LL or
SAF/FMBL prior to release.
1.6. Congressional Security Clearances and Special Access. Per OSD Policy, Congressional
Member clearances are automatic once the Member is elected into their current position in the
United States Senate or U.S. House of Representatives. Once a Member is elected as a seated
member of Congress, the Member is automatically read into SCI and any other classification
needed. To verify the security clearance and special access information of congressional staff
members, contact the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Legislative Affairs Security Office
(OSD/LA), or SAF/LL Security for proper direction.
     1.6.1. In accordance with Hamre, John, J., Memo to the Honorable Jerry Lewis, United
     States House of Representatives, Washington D.C., 22 June 1999, “Members of Congress
     assigned to the defense committees (and to the intelligence committees only for intelligence
     SAPs) are accessed to all DoD SAPs, except for a limited number of programs judged to be
     of extreme sensitivity, referred to as waived SAPs.
     1.6.2. Acting on behalf of the Chairman and the Ranking Member, only the Majority and
     Minority Staff Directors will granted access to waived SAPs. Chairmen and Ranking
     Members may request the Deputy Secretary of Defense to grant exception to this restriction
     on a case by case basis.
     1.6.3. Access to non-waived SAPs by professional staff members of the defense and
     intelligence committees will be determined by the Staff Director and the Minority Staff
     Director, respectively, on behalf of the Chairman and Ranking Member. Accesses will be
     coordinated with the Defense Department’s Special Access Program Coordination Office
     (SAPCO) to ensure compliance with personnel security requirements.
     1.6.4. Members of Congress not assigned to the defense committees (and to the intelligence
     committees only for intelligence SAPs) will be granted access to DoD SAPs (non-waived
     SAPs only) with the concurrence of the DoD after consultation with the Chairman and
     Ranking Member of the defense committees.
     1.6.5. The personal staff of a Member of Congress shall not be granted access to DoD SAPs.
1.7. Industry and Contract Information. Information concerning contractor proprietary
information must be safe-guarded. Special care must be exercised when releasing information
during the source selection process. Proper use of non-disclosure statements must be exercised.

SAF/FMBL action officer that an interim letter is needed. The OPR is responsible for writing the
interim response.
3.3. Inquiries. Inquiries are received and tasked to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff
office, or Air Force Agency. That office or agency may subsequently send the inquiry to another
coordinating office (OCR) or MAJCOM. The proposed response is sent back to SAF/LLI who
sends the response to the constituent. The entire process should take 30 days or less.
   3.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Information. Any inquiry, regardless of the source (written,
   electronic, or telephonic) that might ultimately provide information to a Member of Congress
   or the Executive Branch will be coordinated with HQ AFSOC/IGQ to ensure SAF/LL has
   knowledge of the inquiry. Receiving office may begin or continue work to prepare the
   response while awaiting acknowledgement from and/or approval from SAF/LL to prepare an
   appropriate response.
3.4. Congressional Inquiries to Commanders.

                                             TRAVEL

4.1. Invitation to Travel. The Secretary of Defense or Secretaries of the Military Departments
may extend invitations for sponsored travel within the United States to Members and employees
of Congress. DoD 4515.12 assigns the responsibility for approving and coordinating requests for
transportation from the Congress to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs
(OSD/LA). DoD 4515.12 also describes the procedures for travel at the invitation of the
SECDEF or Service Secretaries.
4.2. Visiting Bases. Members of Congress and their staffs may need to visit Air Force
activities. The Air Force fully supports and encourages these visits. With Secretary of the Air
Force (SECAF) approval, the Air Force may provide transportation for congressional visits.
   4.2.1. Requests for travel by SECAF invitation should be based on significant
   interest/benefit to the Air Force. Examples of valid requests would be to visit a base to
   assess the capabilities of a Composite Wing or to visit HQ Air Combat Command for updates
   on fighter upgrades. Travel to joint organizations or locations of interest to other services
   may not be completed under SECAF invitation.
4.3. Travel Support. Congress may request DoD support for worldwide travel under the
auspices of public law (31 USC 1108 (g)).
4.4. Transportation Approval. Do not commit the Air Force to providing transportation until
SAF/LLO provides notification transportation is approved. SAF/LLO will issue invitational
travel orders authorizing travel and expenditure of funds related to congressional travel.
4.5. Trip Progress. Escorts will email or call SAF/LLO on a regular basis to provide updates
on trip progress and receive any message traffic from home station.
4.6. Schedule Changes. Escorts will coordinate each schedule change with SAF/LLO (and
SAF/FMBL, if applicable) and with all affected facilities, activities, and personnel to avoid
unannounced arrivals. Cancellations should be reported immediately to SAF/LLO.
4.7. Government Funds. Through coordination with SAF/LLO, escorts will be issued
government funds to be used in support of congressional travel. For CONUS travel, member and
staffer expenses directly related to official trips (meals, hotels, airline tickets, etc.) will be paid
by the escort. Base support agencies or private organizations that provide meals or other
authorized services must be reimbursed for those expenses. Expenses related to travel (or
Congressional Visits) completed without invitational travel orders will not be paid using funds
issued through SAF/LL.
4.8. Unescorted Trips. Unescorted trips completed under invitational travel orders will be by
exception only. For unescorted trips, the host commander notifies SAF/LL or SAF/FMBL of
pending visits, itinerary changes, and any new or changed requests. The host will coordinate
directly with all affected facilities, activities, and personnel regarding briefings, transportation,
quarters, or other support.
