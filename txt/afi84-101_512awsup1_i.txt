            years, and support for training and education opportunities available through AFHRA, CAFH,
            Historian Civilian Career Program, and other sources.
        •Monitor and coordinate manpower and personnel status of subordinate history offices.
        •Coordinate on historical property and museum matters. See AFI 84-103, USAF Museum System,
            for guidance.
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                        7


   1.5.3. Numbered Air Forces (NAF), Independent Groups, Squadrons Reporting Directly to
   MAJCOM, and Comparable Units. MAJCOM/HOs establish requirements and procedures for the
   historical services and documentation at these organizations. In conjunction with MAJCOM man-
   power officals, MAJCOM/HOs with determine if these organizations need full-time historians
   assigned. If required, they will submit requests through manpower channels as described in Air Force
   Manpower Standard (AFMS) 101A.
   1.5.4. Direct Reporting Units (DRU) and Field Operating Agencies (FOA) Reporting Directly to
   Headquarters USAF:
       •DRUs and the largest, most independent, historic, or diverse FOAs establish and maintain history
          offices as separate, special staff agencies with qualified personnel who have direct access to
          commanders or directors.
       •A DRU or FOA with subordinate history offices has MAJCOM-like responsibilities for its field
          program. See 1.5.2.
       •Smaller, less significant, FOAs without full time historians establish historical documentation
           requirements, in coordination with HQ USAF/HO, based on mission and available resources.
       •All FOAs with part-time or additional duty historians send names, office addresses, and phone
           numbers of these individuals to HQ USAF/HO.

1.6. Air Force Historians (All Levels).
    •Collect, organize, analyze, and interpret primary documents.
    •Maintain a collection of historical documents and references, including a complete file of your orga-
        nization's periodic histories.
    •Prepare papers and provide historical services that meet the needs of commanders and staffs. Give
        your highest priority to work requested by your commander.
    •Answer historical questions, including those on unit emblems, lineage, and honors.
    •Write periodic histories, heritage pamphlets, studies, and monographs. Full-time historians must
        annually produce at least one monograph, study, essay, or comparable project on a topic of value
        to the Air Force.
    •Process requests for new or revised emblems and organizational flags.
    •Keep the senior leadership in your organization informed about the USAF History Program's pur-
        pose and primary services through briefings and similar tools.
    •Routinely communicate with other historians to promote the free flow of information and ideas.
    •Enlisted historians must possess a top secret clearance to hold the 3H0X1 AFSC. If you are unable
        to acquire a top secret clearance within one year of your retraining date or permanently retain this
        clearance during your career, HQ USAF/HO will request AFMPC to withdraw the AFSC and
        retrain or separate you. Officer and civilian historians should also possess a top secret clearance.
1.6. (512AW) Air Force Historians (All Levels). (Added) Group and Squadron Historians gather perti-
nent information about the organization and compile a semi-annual history in statistical and narrative for-
mat using AFI 84-101 and this supplement (Attachment 22 (Added)) as a guide.

    1.6.1. (Added-512AW) Group and Squadron Historians ensure historical submissions contain sup-
    porting documents, to include end-of-tour reports, photographs, exercise and inspection reports, main-
    tenance summaries, recruiting and manning reports, active duty and special mission reports.
    1.6.2. (Added-512AW) Submission procedures will be as follows:
       1.6.2.1. (Added-512AW) Staff Agency, Group, and Squadron Historians submit computer-gener-
       ated histories via electronic mail to the 512 AW/HO office. (Send courtesy copy to approving offi-
       cial, in lieu of a signature).
       1.6.2.2. (Added-512AW) Staff Agency, Group, and Squadron Historians submit histories with
       non-computer-generated supporting documents (original reports) via electronic mail to the 512
       AW/HO office. (Send courtesy copy to approving official, in lieu of signature). Send original
       report through distribution with copies of supporting documents and original signatures. Electron-
       ically mailed histories should bear final statement: “Copies of supporting documents to follow.”
    1.6.3. (Added-512AW) Group and Squadron Historians use the Wing file under History Program
    located on the wing share (S) drive to obtain a copy of a sample format and published history reports.
    Completed reports will be sent via electronic mail to the Wing Historian.

                        HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND PROJECTS

2.1. Products. Historians prepare several types of publications, papers, and other products and support
projects like historical exhibits and displays. These products:
    •Preserve an official record of Air Force mission accomplishment.
    •Make valuable information available to decision-makers and action officers.
    •Support professional military education.
    •Promote awareness of Air Force heritage.
    •Provide reference material for researchers.
Section A--Periodic Histories

2.2. Periodic Histories (RCS: HAF-HO(A&SA)7101). Consist of narrative accounts of significant
events amplified by collections of supporting documents. They are essential to the corporate memory of
Air Force organizations because they systematically preserve information for research and reference.
   2.2.1. Each organization with a full-time historian prepares a periodic history according to instruc-
   tions in Chapter 3. Additional duty or part-time historians follow guidance in Attachment 2 unless
   directed otherwise by higher headquarters.
   2.2.2. Standard coverage periods and due dtes for periodic histories are:
       •1 calendar year for organizations above wing level. Complete them by the last day of the 7th
           month following the end of the coverage period.
       •6 months for organizations at wing level and lower. Complete them by the last day of the 4th
           month following the coverage period.
   NOTE: A history is complete once the commander reviews and signs it.
   2.2.2. (512AW) Periodic Histories (RCS: HAF-HO(A&SA)7101). Histories should be submitted
   according to the following schedule:
       2.2.2.1. (Added-512AW) 1 October through 31 March (Current FY): NLT May (Current FY)
       2.2.2.2. (Added-512AW) 1 April through 30 September (Current FY): NLT November (Subse-
       quent FY)
   2.2.3. HQ USAF/HO may adjust the coverage period and due date of periodic histories for MAJ-
   COMs, HQ USAF DRUs, and FOAs. MAJCOM/HOs may adjust the coverage period and due date of
   periodic histories for their subordinate organizations based on command or individual needs. Inform
   HQ USAF/HO of such changes.
   2.2.4. Print and distribute your periodic history within 15 calendar days of the completion date.
   2.2.5. Periodic histories (RCS: HAF-HO(A&SA)7101) are designated emergency status code C-2;
   continue normal reporting during emergency conditions.

Section B--Heritage Pamphlets

2.3. Historical Pamphlets. Assigned personnel are the primary audience for these brief, unclassified
historical accounts of an organization and any predecessor or related organizations. Clear the pamphlet
through Public Affairs for distribution outside the organization.
     2.3.1. Organizations with full-time historians prepare and publish these pamphlets for widespread
     internal distribution. Additionally, send copies to:
         •MAJCOM/HO.
         •HQ USAF/HO.
         •AFHRA/ISA and AFHRA/RS (to accompany lineage and honors folders).
         •CAFH/HOR.
     2.3.2. The Heritage Pamphlet normally consists of a narrative plus tables with key lineage, honors,
     and mission data.
        2.3.2.1. Include a short history of the installation in the pamphlet of a base host unit.
     2.3.3. The pamphlet is a living document. With each new edition, work to improve the content and
     style. Use an attractive cover design and well-chosen illustrations if they can be reproduced clearly
     and economically. Update it:
         •Annually.
         •After major changes in mission, organization, leadership, or accomplishments.
Section C--Historical Studies

2.4. Historical Studies. Air Force Historians at all levels research and write a variety of historical prod-
ucts--both classified and unclassified--studying significant issues, policies, operations, programs, devel-
opments, doctrine, procedures, or comparable topics.
     2.4.1. These products can vary widely in length and format depending on the topic covered and
     intended audience. In-depth narrative studies of significant topics should provide thorough source
     citations for the information presented and present many of the same features and components used in
     the preparation of periodic histories (see Chapter 3). These include forewords, prefaces, contents,
     photographs, illustrations, tables, charts, appendices, glossaries, indexes, bibliographies, and support-
     ing documents. Titles and subtitles should be descriptive, and covers should be attractive. In some
     cases, extensive studies on topics of general interest may, if unclassified and cleared for public
     release, be published as books. In addition to lengthy and fully documented narrative examinations of
     a topic (sometimes referred to as “monographs”), historical studies can also take the form of chronol-
     ogies, study reports, technical reports, statistical analyses, bibliographical essays, and annotated doc-
     ument collections.
     2.4.2. Historians at wings, centers, and other subordinate organizations must coordinate proposed
     studies and final drafts with MAJCOM/HOs. Historians at MAJCOM headquarters, FOAs, and DRUs
     will inform HQ USAF/HO of proposed topics of potential Air Force-wide interest and may circulate
     drafts to HQ USAF/HO for review and comment.
     2.4.3. Distribute final products as widely as possible contingent on the subject and, for classified
     studies, the “need-to-know” principle. MAJCOM/HOs must approve distribution outside of originat-
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                    11


   ing wings and centers. Always send at least two copies to AFHRA/ISA, HQ USAF/HO, and AFHSO/
   HOR. As appropriate, provide copies to other history offices in the Air Force, unified commands,
   other services, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff that might be interested in the topic. Provide copies to
   functional offices at HQ USAF as appropriate to the topic. Send studies and reports to the Air Univer-
   sity Library as required by AFI 36-2303, Documents and Publications for AU Library, and other ref-
   erence libraries and document repositories as appropriate. Submit studies on technical subjects to the
   Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) in accordance with AFI 61-202, USAF Technical Pub-
   lications Program. Before distribution or release to members of the public, submit final manuscripts
   to Public Affairs offices in accordance with AFI 35-205, Air Force Security and Policy Review Pro-
   gram.
Section D--Other Historical Projects

2.5. Oral History Interviews. Edit, publish, and distribute especially informative oral history inter-
views in the same manner as studies. Add topic headings, explanatory footnotes, and appropriate appen-
dices. You may also add historical photographs. See paragraph 3.4.3.9. for guidance on conducting
interviews.
   2.5.1. Include oral history interview transcripts or summaries as supporting documents in periodic
   histories.
   2.5.2. Send transcripts and audiocassettes to AFHRA/RS for the Air Force Oral History collection.

2.6. Books. Historians (normally from the CAFH or AFHRA) publish these major projects through the
Government Printing Office after a thorough review process and professional editing. In some cases,
field historians may publish books locally, usually in cooperation with nonprofit organizations.
   2.6.1. Coordinate proposals for all such projects with HQ USAF/HO.

2.7. Articles and Essays. Historians who know about airpower or related topics are encouraged to write
articles and essays (including book reviews) for publication.
   2.7.1. Submit material for security and policy review prior to publication. Follow the instructions in
   AFI 35-205, Air Force Security and Policy Review Program.
   2.7.2. Send an advance copy to the Air Force Historian (HQ USAF/HO).

2.8. Papers. Use every opportunity to prepare background papers, point papers, talking papers, and
similar products on the historical aspects of issues that interest your commanders and directors.
   2.8.1. For formats, see AF Handbook (AFH) 37-137, The Tongue and Quill.

2.9. Briefings and Visual Information. Prepare slide briefings and work with Visual Information and
Combat Camera personnel in preparing video documentaries and other historical audiovisual projects of
interest to your organization or the Air Force.

2.10. Exhibits. Help research and gather photographs, artifacts, and other memorabilia for exhibits that
foster an appreciation of the United States Air Force's heritage and your organization's history. A
well-done, professional exhibit is a multi-media equivalent to a monograph or study. See AFI 84-103,
USAF Museum System, for further guidance.

        WRITING PERIODIC HISTORIES AND OTHER HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS

3.1. Using the Historical Method. The principles and procedures in this section apply primarily to the
preparation of periodic histories, but you may also adapt and use them when preparing other types of pub-
lications.
     3.1.1. Historical Perspective. Use historical perspective to determine what information is worthy of
     record based on your organization's mission, your professional judgment, and suggestions by your
     commander and staff.
     3.1.2. Impartiality. Be an impartial observer. Never distort history by omitting information that
     reflects negatively on your organization or by including information that inaccurately portrays its suc-
     cesses.
     3.1.3. Facts:
         •Carefully and methodically collect, assemble, verify, and present factual data as the basis for
            conclusions and interpretations.
         •Evaluate data to determine relative importance.
         •Be specific in presenting the facts.
         •Remain alert to gaps and inaccuracies in official documents and reports.
     3.1.4. Emphasis. In the narrative and your supporting documents, emphasize events affecting:
         •Your organization's mission performance.
         •Its leaders' decision-making.
         •Outside agencies' actions that influenced your organization's activities.
         •Your organization's execution of higher headquarters policies and directives.
     3.1.5. Topics. All manner of topics and events come under the purview of historians, but only signif-
     icant activities affecting mission accomplishment merit discussion. Especially consider information
     that will be useful to future planners. The list below, while neither inclusive nor exclusive, indicates
     topics generally worthy of consideration for historical coverage.
         •Mission.
         •Organization.
         •Relationships with other organizations.
         •Planning.
         •Operations.
         •Training.
         •Logistics.
         •Maintenance.
         •Communications and electronics.
         •Environment.

       •Facilities.
       •Community and host nation relations.
Section A--Preparing Periodic Histories

3.2. Focus. Preparing periodic histories of an Air Force organization requires you to apply historical
methodology and discipline to current and recent events to systematically preserve significant informa-
tion for the future.

3.3. Research Methodology. Conducting timely, continuing, systematic, and thorough research is essen-
tial to preparing useful periodic histories. Such research is a never-ending process.
   3.3.1. Begin with an outline:
       •Use the table of contents of the previous history and your research file plan to develop a prelimi-
          nary outline of potential subjects. Revise the outline as you discover new topics and discard
          old ones.
       •Review the narrative of the previous history to help determine topics for research. Various activ-
          ities may overlap reporting periods.
       •Solicit recommendations from the commander, staff, and unit members.
   3.3.2. Follow these general guidelines:
       •Conduct systematic research in the files of key offices in the organization.
       •Continually monitor key offices that destroy their records on a short cycle or rely on electroni-
           cally stored data. Include in your research the electronic mail (E-mail) accounts and comput-
           erized databases of key offices.
       •Watch for key words when screening documents to detect important information about the unit's
           mission.
       •Take notes, make extracts, or copy documents completely for reference or use as supporting doc-
           uments.
       •Review material (including E-mail) obtained through automatic distribution and the recurring
           reports index prepared by Information Management offices.
       •Subscribe to those Report Control Symbol (RCS) products you use repeatedly as well as to pol-
           icy letters, bulletins, and other potential sources of useful information.
       •Obtain or have easy access to the directives pertaining to the unit's mission and weapons sys-
           tems. AFIND 2, Numerical Index of Standard and Recurring Air Force Publications, lists all
           Air Force publications.
       •Establish a systematic method of filing and referencing research material. Historians commonly
           use a topical filing system. Add or delete topics as your research and writing progress.
           Besides using the files as the basis for your historical reporting, you'll find them to be handy
           reference tools for answering inquiries about recent events.

3.4. Historical Sources. Categorize as either primary or secondary:
    •Primary sources are original documents or first records of facts or events, for example, after-action
        reports and trip reports.
14                                                          AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004


     •Secondary sources are other writers' discussions, interpretations, or analyses of primary material.
     3.4.1. Historians depend on primary sources to provide historical facts and rely on secondary sources
     for interpretation and perspective. Assure the authenticity of all primary sources against the following
     criteria:
         •A signed, dated copy of a memo or letter on letterhead stationery.
         •A document certified by the office of origin.
         •Orders and other directives.
     3.4.2. Critically examine information and opinions contained in one primary source by comparing it
     with other sources. Information collated from a number of sources usually presents a more accurate
     version of an event than data you get from a single source.
     3.4.3. Some of a historian's most important sources include:
        3.4.3.1. Publications. Policy and mission directives (AFPD and AFMD), instructions (AFI),
        doctrine documents (AFDD), and supplements affect the structure and mission of a organization.
        Review them frequently for changes.
        3.4.3.2. Orders. Military headquarters direct and authenticate changes, actions, or procedures
        through various types of orders. Review all orders for possible use. These include movement,
        alert, warning, deployment, execution, tasking, operations, technical, and special orders.
        3.4.3.3. Correspondence:
            •Obtain letters, memoranda, messages, and comparable communications within and between
                organizations and key personnel that are important to documenting developments of his-
                torical significance.
            •Include material transmitted via facsimile (fax) or E-mail.
        3.4.3.4. Reports and Studies:
            •Carefully consider preserving such documents, prepared by or about an organization, in the
                 periodic history.
            •Include unit assessments and reports of inspections, tests, audits, major exercises, and opera-
                 tions.
            •Judge the significance of less formal reports, such as trip reports, on their subject and con-
                 tent.
            •A staff study analyzes an issue and establishes the central concern and all related facts. It
                 considers various options and offers recommendations. Staff studies are of special interest
                 to historians because they often precede and form the basis for significant decisions.
            •If their topics warrant, preserve studies and reports that are presented as briefings, position
                 papers, talking papers, and other less formal documentation.
            •Include as a supporting document in the periodic history an end-of-tour report prepared by a
                 departing commander (1.4.1.). It relates a unique perspective on the commander's major
                 challenges, issues, accomplishments, problems, and lessons learned.
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                                        15


     3.4.3.5. Statistical and Graphic Matter. I n c l u d e o rg a n i z a t i o n a l c h a r t s , s t a t i o n l i s t s ,
     order-of-battle information, maps, manning documents, sortie data, and so on. They are indispens-
     able components of periodic histories. Put them within the narrative or in its appendices.
     3.4.3.6. Combat Data. Collect and record detailed data and comprehensive documentation dur-
     ing wartime and contingency operations. Such research is the highest priority for historians in
     operational units and headquarters. Commanders and staffs must provide full support to this
     effort, which is critical to later historical analysis, research, and writing. See AFI 84-102, Histor-
     ical Operations in Contingency and War, for guidance on wartime and contingency historical
     requirements.
     3.4.3.7. Personnel Data. People make history; consequently unit histories and historical studies
     reflect the activity of personnel, en masse and individually.
         •Obtain information on key individuals from interviews or unit records.
         •Include biographies of the unit's high-ranking officials as supporting documents.
     3.4.3.8. Meetings. Historians will attend staff meetings, briefings, and other policy-making gath-
     erings. These important sources of perspective and information are essential to preparing the peri-
     odic history.
     3.4.3.9. Interviews. Personal interviews may be your only source regarding exchanges of infor-
     mation and decisions made by telephone or another undocumented means.
         •Conduct interviews with the commander and senior staff members at least once during each
             reporting period.
         •Conduct interviews as soon as possible after key events take place, while the facts are still
             clear in the interviewee's mind.
         •Attempt to verify information from interviews by consulting validated primary and second-
             ary documents because opinions and memories differ and may, on occasion, diverge from
             the actual facts. In general, data contained in documents is more trustworthy than details
             obtained in an interview.
         •Before the interview, prepare a list of questions based on thorough research of important
             issues confronting the unit. Phrase your questions to encourage elaboration (not merely
             "Yes" or "No" answers). Focus questions on information unavailable from other sources
             and on confirming questionable information collected from other sources.
         •Use a tape recorder or take thorough notes during interviews to ensure accurate information.
             Ask the interviewee for permission to use a tape recorder.
         •Give the interviewee a transcript or summarized version of the interview for review, correc-
             tion, and authentication.
         •Use transcripts or summaries of significant interviews as supporting documents in periodic
             histories. Authenticated interviews are "official" documents and thus primary sources.
     3.4.3.10. Questionnaires. Use only when other methods are not practical since questionnaires
     usually elicit only short answers.
     3.4.3.11. Accident Information. When covering accidents, do not cite mishap messages or
     safety investigation board reports as sources or use as supporting documents. See AFI 91-204,
     Investigation and Reporting of US Air Force Mishaps (formerly AFR 127-4) for restrictions on
16                                                        AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004


        privileged safety information. Never mention any formal findings, conclusions, causes, or recom-
        mendations. You may cover the basic facts about an accident (presented in Part I of an investiga-
        tion board's report) in accordance with AFI 51-503, Aircraft, Missile, Nuclear, and Space Accident
        Investigations (formerly AFR 110-14).

3.5. Security and Administrative Markings. Mark and handle historical publications according to the
references listed below. Achieve a working familiarity with these directives.
    •DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program Regulation, and AFI 31-401 (formerly AFR 205-1),
       Information Security Program Management, and other pertinent directives covering classified
       information.
    •AFI 37-131 (formerly AFR 4-33), Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program, For Official Use
       Only (FOUO) material.
    •AFI 90-201 (formerly AFR 123-1), Inspector General Activities, for inspection-related privileged
       information (PV) material.
     •AFI 61-204 (formerly AFR 80-30, 80-34, and 83-3), Controlling the Distribution of Classified and
        Unclassified Scientific and Technical Information, for scientific and technical information with a
        distribution limitation (DL).
     •Other directives as required.

3.6. Components of Periodic Histories. Unless a part is identified here as optional, you must use all of
these components, in this order, in a periodic history. You may also add other components that enhance
the usefulness of the product.
     3.6.1. Covers. Use preprinted blue covers until stocks are exhausted. Then use standard red-brown
     pressboard covers.
         •Red-brown covers available from base supply:
                        - NSN 7510-00-286-7794 for left-bind covers without ACCO fasteners.
                       - NSN 7510-00-281-4309 for top-bind covers.
        •Follow Attachment 3 for Front-cover, use an appropriately sized adhesive label
        •Be sure information from the title page appears on the front of the history. For a blue cover, be
            sure the information shows through a die-cut window. For a pressboard cover, use an appro-
            priately sized adhesive label.
        •The full name of the unit.
        •Inclusive dates of the period covered.
        •(U) if the volume is classified
        •The volume number.
     3.6.2. Title Page. Follow Attachment 3 for title page information and layout requirements.
     3.6.3. Security Notice and Administrative Controls Page. This page summarizes information
     about the sources used to prepare the volume. This page is required in every volume of a periodic his-
     tory (see Attachment 4 for further guidelines) unless it contains no classified or controlled informa-
     tion.
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                      17


     •State the highest classification of the volume.
     •List any special notations that apply to the data in the report or to the supporting documents.
     •List all applicable directives, manuals, and classification guides.
  3.6.4. Frontispiece (Optional). Use a relevant illustration that will reproduce clearly. .
  3.6.5. Foreword (Optional). A statement written by someone other than the author.
  3.6.6. Preface (Optional). An explanatory statement by the author or the chief historian.
  3.6.7. Table of Contents. This is an information-finding aid. Keep the reader in mind as you com-
  pile it:
      •Make it specific and accurate.
      •List, by page number, all chapters, sections, subsections, and appendices.
      •List all supporting document volumes and indicate the document numbers in each volume.
      •Avoid "canned" section and subsection headings in favor of short, descriptive headings.
      •Use the format in Attachment 5.
  3.6.8. List of Illustrations. List, by page number, all tables, charts, photographs, and maps. Use the
  format in Attachment 6.
  3.6.9. Chronology. List events in chronological order. For this part:
      •Determine what to include primarily by gauging the significance of the information to the unit.
      •Cross-reference each entry by page number to related narrative discussion if it exists. When an
          entry does not relate to the narrative, prepare a footnote that identifies the entry's sources.
          Identify appropriate sources as supporting documents according to instructions in 3.6.22.1.
      •If classified, you should consider preparing an unclassified edition of the chronology as a sepa-
          rate document for distribution throughout the unit's staff.
      •Use format in Attachment 7.
  3.6.10. Executive Summary (Optional). A brief overview of the major events and topics covered in
  the periodic history, their significance, and the author's perspectives or conclusions. If done, consider
  publishing the summary separately for wide distribution in the organization.
  3.6.11. Narrative. As the major component of a periodic history, the narrative relates important
  events in an organized, interesting, and concise manner. Use the typing and layout instructions in 3.7.
  See the samples in Attachment 8.
     3.6.11.1. .Long, expansive narratives do not equate to a high quality or useful periodic history.
     Do not fill your product with excessive background information from previous editions or discus-
     sions not directly relevant to your organization's mission.
         •For example, the typical wing-level periodic history should not exceed:
                     -100 pages of narrative for a semiannual edition.
                     -175 pages of narrative for an annual edition.
         •Above the wing-level, strive for a concise, useable product focused on major issues and
            events.
18                                                       AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004


     3.6.11.2. Select topics of potential long-term interest. Treat each topic in the narrative according
     to its importance, especially its effect on the unit's ability to accomplish its mission. Detailed data
     on many topics--especially dealing with resources and support--could be needed for future refer-
     ence and research, even though these topics may not warrant discussion in the narrative. Preserve
     sufficient information about such topics in the appendices and supporting documents.
     3.6.11.3. The narrative must be original writing, not copied from source documents or previous
     periodic histories. A narrative history is not just a summary of dates, places, personnel, and statis-
     tics, nor is it mere statements of fact in outline form. When covering significant topics, provide
     facts, reasons, background, discussion, interpretation, and analysis. Avoid verbosity and exhaus-
     tive detail.
     3.6.11.4. Write clearly and accurately in simple, direct, and grammatically correct language.
     Write mostly in the past tense using the active voice as much as possible. Avoid military jargon
     and words not commonly known. Define or explain scientific and technical terms. Limit your use
     of abbreviations and acronyms in the narrative, explaining them when first used in the text and
     listing them in the glossary. Do not use only office symbols in the narrative because they tend to
     change over time.
     3.6.11.5. Provide complete dates in the narrative, that is, day, month, and year. Example: 30
     April 1995.
     3.6.11.6. Spell out the full given name (first name, middle initial, and surname) when first men-
     tioning a person in the narrative or the roster of key personnel. Abbreviate military titles only
     when followed by initials or given names. Example: Brig Gen Sidney R. Smith. In later refer-
     ences, omit the qualifying part of the military title, spell out the rank, and use only the last name.
     Example: General Smith. Use the full title of civilian office holders without abbreviation in the
     text. Example: Secretary of Defense Jerry B. Lathrop. You may abbreviate titles in the notes for
     conciseness. Don't substitute pay grades (civilian or military) for position titles.
     3.6.11.7. Give definite geographical locations rather than post office numbers, grids, or general
     areas. Relate a relatively unknown place to a better-known one. Example: Moody AFB is 10
     miles northeast of Valdosta, GA. Include all geographical names in the gazetteer, if used (see
     3.6.18.). Abbreviate state names only when they follow the name of a town or city.
     3.6.11.8. Place lengthy statistics in charts, tables, or appendices; explain their significance and
     meaning in the narrative.
     3.6.11.9. Spell out numbers in the narrative when they begin a sentence and when they are less
     than 10. Use Arabic numbers to express units of time, weight, and measurement. Example: 8
     hours, 2,000 pounds, 20 feet.
     3.6.11.10. Use the 24-hour clock when referring to time, making clear whether the time is local
     (L) or Greenwich Mean Time, which is known in military terminology as Zulu (Z). Example:
     2130L or 2130Z.
     3.6.11.11. Single-space all quotations of five or more typed lines and indent them five spaces
     from both margins. Do not use long quotations, except where meaning would be lost or the value
     reduced significantly by paraphrasing or summarizing. Use an ellipsis, that is, three spaced dots
     (. . .), to indicate when you omit any words from a direct quotation. Use an ellipsis and a period
     (. . . .), i.e., four spaced dots, to indicate when you omit the end of a sentence. Omissions must not
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                         19


     change the meaning of the passage. Give every direct quotation a citation, that is, an acknowledg-
     ment of your source. Put note reference number at end of quotation in the text.
  3.6.12. Graphics. Use diagrams, illustrations, photographs, maps, tables, and similar materials to
  add clarity, interest, and conciseness to your narrative descriptions. Caption all graphics with dates,
  subjects, classification, downgrade and declassification instructions, administrative or special han-
  dling caveats. Indicate sources used. Do not use color legends in graphic presentations; when the
  periodic history is reproduced or microfilmed in black and white, the legend will lose any meaning
  implied by the color.
  3.6.13. Photographs. Use only photographs of historical value. Follow these guidelines:
      •In your captions, fully identify the who, what, when, and where of the photograph.
      •Use glossy 8- by 10-inch prints when your product will not be printed by a means that assures
          high resolution reproduction of photographs with the narrative.
      •For a product being reproduced by high resolution means, incorporate smaller photographs or
          properly adjusted digital images into the layout of the manuscript.
      •When available, place original prints and negatives of key photographs in an envelope at the
          back of volume one of the copy you send to AFHRA. Place identifying captions and classifi-
          cation data on the back of each print in a way that does not damage the picture.
  3.6.14. Deleted.
  3.6.15. Appendices. Appropriate items for appendices include charts, tables, graphs, statistical sum-
  maries, and compilations of details. Follow these guidelines:
      •An appendix must be able to stand as an independent document when extracted from the history.
          It will list all sources used for its data and, if classified, it will contain downgrade and declas-
          sification instructions.
      •Identify each appendix by a capital letter.
      •Appendix A is always Lineage and Honors data (see Attachment 10).
      •Appendix B is always the Roster of Key Personnel (see Attachment 11).
      •Appendix C is always Personnel Statistics (authorized and assigned).
      •Appendix D is always Organizational Structure Charts.
      •MAJCOMs may establish other mandatory appendices based on their missions.
  3.6.16. Notes. Cite sources of information in footnotes or endnotes. See Attachment 8 and Attach-
  ment 12.
  3.6.17. Glossary. List, in alphabetical order, frequently used abbreviations, acronyms, terms, and
  symbols, with a definition or explanation of each. Use the format in Attachment 13.
  3.6.18. Gazetteer (Optional). An alphabetical list of geographical place names with their locations
  is especially useful for organizations that are active overseas . Use the format in Attachment 14.
  3.6.19. List of Supporting Documents. In the narrative volume, list all supporting documents in
  numerical order, giving essentially the same identifying information and classification data required
  for a note. In each supporting document volume, list only the documents contained in that volume,
  giving the same information required above. Use the format in Attachment 15.
20                                                           AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004


     3.6.20. Index. An index is a valuable information-finding aid consisting of an alphabetical list of
     names and subjects from the text and the page numbers where they appear. Use the format in Attach-
     ment 16.
        3.6.20.1. Prepare an index for all of these products that have more than 100 pages of narrative:
            •Periodic histories.
            •Monographs.
            •Books.
        3.6.20.2. Prepare an index for any publication featuring an extensive chronology that describes
        events not covered in a narrative.
     3.6.21. Distribution List. Put a complete distribution list in the narrative volume. Include:
         •The total number of volumes and copies produced.
         •The organization and office symbols for those you are sending copies.
         •The number of copies sent to each office.
         •Use the format in Attachment 17.
     3.6.22. Supporting Documents. In the long term, a solid collection of supporting documents forms
     an organized database that may be the most valuable aspect of a periodic history. Select supporting
     documents that amplify the narrative or provide additional information likely to be needed for future
     reference and research.
        3.6.22.1. Organize and identify supporting documents consecutively by major portions of the
        product. Keep the numbering scheme consistent throughout all volumes of supporting documents.
        Include all G-series special orders (in numerical sequence) issued by or for the organization during
        the period covered as the first supporting document in every periodic history.
        3.6.22.2. In the volumes sent to AFHRA, use black ink to mark the supporting document number
        in the lower right corner of each page of every document to permit efficient identification on
        microfilm copies. For supporting document volumes retained at the unit, you need only number
        the first page of each document.
        3.6.22.3. Prepare a front cover and title page for each supporting document volume according to
        the instructions in 3.6.1. and 3.6.2. Each volume must contain a Security Notice and Administra-
        tive Controls page and a List of Supporting Documents prepared according to the instructions in
        3.6.3. and 3.6.19.
        3.6.22.4. Be sure that all supporting documents are legible for microfilming. If not, create a "true
        copy," that is, a , retyped, verbatim duplicate or extract with a signature certifying its authenticity.
        3.6.22.5. Do not remove from files the record copies of documents coded for transfer to staging
        areas or permanent retention. Make copies of such documents to use in your history.
        3.6.22.6. You may organize a collection of well-chosen documents on a specific topic, normally
        in chronological order, to maintain the integrity of the collection, and to simplify document iden-
        tification. You can cite the entire collection in the footnotes rather than each individual document.
        Example: "See SD 101 - SD 121, info used is FOUO." The periodic history's List of Supporting
        Documents will include a complete listing of every supporting document to help researchers find
        specific documents.
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                     21


      3.6.22.7. Reduce larger-than-standard paper, such as legal-sized documents, maps, and charts, to
      8.5- by 11-inch paper. If you can't maintain quality and readability, bind odd-sized documents sep-
      arately as a legal-sized volume, folding the documents carefully. Use the least number of folds
      possible.
      3.6.22.8. Copy documents that are smaller than standard size onto standard-sized paper. When
      you can't, and the document is printed or written on only one side of the paper, tape all sides to a
      standard-sized sheet of bond paper with Magic Mending Tape. Don't use cellophane tape because
      it deteriorates. Don't cover information with the tape, even if it means leaving a side untaped.
      Don't use staples or glue because staples rust and glue may damage the document.
      3.6.22.9. Bind bulky or oversized documents together in a separate volume, making sure that they
      can be read without disassembling the volume. If the margins are too small to permit reading
      without disassembling, extend the document's cover by taping it to a piece of plain heavy paper
      that is similar in strength to the cover of a paperback book.
      3.6.22.10. Historical information is often not on paper. Examples: video and audio tapes, com-
      puter databases, microfilm and microfiche, slides, and other material. Convert essential audio and
      computerized information to paper products if possible. Include other forms of media as support-
      ing documents only if they are of major historical value and only after checking with MAJCOM/
      HO and AFHRA.
      3.6.22.11. Place microfiche, flat film, transparencies, slides, and the like in a sturdy envelope
      made from acid-free paper. Then attach the envelope to a page as if it were a small document (see
      3.12.3.8.). Place the envelope flap to keep the contents from falling out. Items larger than stan-
      dard size go in an oversize volume (see 3.6.22.9.).
      3.6.22.12. In rare cases, you may treat very valuable microfilm rolls or audio or video tapes as
      separate volumes of the supporting documents for the periodic history. Prominently display title,
      volume number, security classification, and other information on suitable containers. Normally,
      however, you offer historically valuable motion picture film and video tapes to the Defense
      Motion Media Repository through Visual Information or Combat Camera channels, because the
      AFHRA is not equipped to maintain and use such sources.

3.7. Formatting the Periodic History:
   3.7.1. Page and Margin Specifications:
       •Use 8.5- by 11-inch bond paper.
       •Use a 1.5-inch margin on bound side of the page and 1-inch margins on other three sides.
       •Set line spacing for narrative text between 1.2 and 1.5 spaces.
       •Set line spacing for notes at 1 space.
   3.7.2. Type Font and Size Specifications:
       •Use a type font of 12 characters per inch (approximate equivalent in points) or larger throughout
          the product. Do not use smaller fonts; they are difficult to read on microfilm.
       •Use a medium weight font for the majority of product to enhance readability when microfilmed.
          This does not limit use of boldface fonts for headings, etc.
       •Don't use decorative or ornate type fonts.
22                                                          AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004


     3.7.3. Page Numbering Specifications:
         •Number front matter pages with lowercase Roman numerals at the bottom of page
         •Number narrative and back matter pages with Arabic numerals centered at the bottom of page or
            on the outside margin at the top of page. Be consistent throughout the product.
         •Number pages consecutively throughout entire narrative volume. See 3.6.22.1. and 3.6.22.2. for
            numbering the pages of supporting documents volumes.
     3.7.4. Text Layout. Limit to single-column (broadmeasure). Do not use multiple column layouts for
     normal text.

3.8. Binding. Use the instructions in Attachment 18.

3.9. Review and Coordination:
     3.9.1. Coordinate draft portions of the periodic history with responsible individuals or offices before
     submitting the product to the commander for review. Staff agencies ensure accuracy and complete-
     ness of the information and the security markings and handling instructions. They don't approve or
     disapprove topic selection or extent of coverage of specific topics in the narrative. The historian will
     present the staff's concerns and disagreements over these issues to the commander for resolution.
     3.9.2. Carefully proofread and edit each periodic history before submitting it to the commander for
     review. Examine each history for accuracy of content and for compliance with the standards in this
     instruction.
     3.9.3. The commander will sign the title page to indicate final approval of the periodic history. In the
     event of an extended absence of the commander, the vice commander or second-in-command may
     sign the product.

3.10. Distribution:
     3.10.1. Prepare two complete copies:
        •Copy 1. Use the most legible versions of the narrative and supporting documents. Send to
            AFHRA/ISA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
        •Copy 2. Retain it at the organization.
     3.10.2. For additional narrative volume copies, follow MAJCOM and unit policy on distribution.
         •Comply with need-to-know criteria when distributing copies of classified narratives.
         •Consider producing unclassified executive summaries, extracts of chapters or other portions on
             specific topics to permit wider distribution.

3.11. Starting and Ending Periodic Histories. The periodic history of an activating unit begins on the
effective date of activation. The final periodic history of an inactivating unit covers activities through the
inactivation date.
     3.11.1. Ending Reports. Complete the periodic history of an inactivated, disbanded, or discontinued
     unit through the effective date of its termination. MAJCOM/HO:
         •Determines the due date of the final (close-out) periodic history.
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                       23


       •Advises HQ USAF/HO as early as possible of the date the historian will be available for reas-
          signment to another base.
       •Makes funding for completion of the close-out history a top priority. Early departure of civilian
          historians may require completion by other means, such as temporary duty (TDY) assistance.
   3.11.2. Unit Redesignation. When a unit is redesignated:
       •Don't break the periodic history reporting cycle for the redesignation. Maintain normal publica-
           tion schedule.
       •Submit the history for the period in which the redesignation occurred under the unit's new desig-
           nation. Refer to the earlier designation on the title page. Example: 999th Wing, formerly
           999th Tactical Fighter Wing.
       •Ensure the action is a redesignation and not the consolidation of two units or the organization of
           an entirely new unit.
   3.11.3. Unit Transfers. When a unit is transferred from one command to another
       •Send completed periodic histories to the former command until the effective date of transfer.
       •Send completed periodic histories to the new command after the effective date of transfer.
       •Send copies of periodic histories on the transition period to the former command if requested.
Section B--Other Historical Products

3.12. Historical Activity Reports. This report documents accomplishments and contributions by each
headquarters and field history office. HQ USAF/HO uses it to provide data to the Air Force leadership on
the entire history program.
   3.12.1. All MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs with historians submit the semiannual Historical Activity
   Report (RCS: HAF-HO(SA)8202) to arrive at HQ USAF/HO, 170 Luke Ave, Suite 400, Washington,
   DC 20332-5113 no later than 20 working days after the 6-month periods ending 30 June and 31
   December. Each MAJCOM/HO will also provide courtesy copies to all other MAJCOMs.
   3.12.2. This report has emergency status code C-2: Continue normal reporting during emergency
   conditions. Don't send this report by message during MINIMIZE.
   3.12.3. Prepare the historical activity report using the format in the following paragraphs. Enter NA
   when items don't apply.

position of Air Force Records - Records Disposition Schedule, to retain and dispose of historical records.

3.16. Personal Papers. Solicit and assist in the collection of personal papers of historical value from
retired or deceased Air Force personnel and the transfer of these papers to the AFHRA. When identifying
a candidate, consult with the MAJCOM/HO and AFHRA for specific guidance before proceeding.

3.17. Evaluating History Programs:
   3.17.1. HQ USAF/HO. Monitors MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU history programs by reviewing activity
   reports, periodic histories, and other publications. Also visits MAJCOM/HOs and attends MAJCOM
   historian workshops to gauge the management and operational effectiveness of historical offices and
   commands.
   3.17.2. MAJCOM/HOs. Conduct periodic staff visits to monitor the management and operation of
   subordinate offices. They assess periodic histories and other appropriate publications submitted by
   subordinate organizations within 60 days of receipt.
       3.17.2.1. Their quality assessment:
           •Focuses primarily on professional historical standards such as accuracy, objectivity, compre-
               hensiveness, consistency, balance, analysis, clarity, and selection of supporting docu-
               ments.
           •Also addresses format, appearance, printing, security, and administrative markings.
           •Assigns each historical publication a rating of outstanding, excellent, satisfactory, marginal,
               or unsatisfactory.
           •Determines, case by case, whether it is in the best interest of the USAF History Program to
               send a product receiving a marginal or unsatisfactory rating back to be rewritten or
               revised.
26                                                        AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004


        3.17.2.2. The MAJCOM/HOs prepare and send two memoranda regarding their quality assess-
        ment:
           •A brief memorandum of evaluation to the organization's commander highlighting the overall
               rating and key strengths and weaknesses of the product.
           •A detailed memorandum to the author outlining specific findings on the assessed areas. The
               detailed letter, which serves as a training tool, includes suggestions for improvement.
           •Send copies of both memoranda to HQ USAF/HO.

3.18. Microfilming Historical Materials. Microfilming preserves historical materials and increases
their accessibility.
     3.18.1. Air Force historical materials, which are covered in AFI 37-133, Volume II, Disposition of Air
     Force Records - Records Disposition Schedule, include periodic histories, monographs, special stud-
     ies, and other reports along with associated supporting documents and other archival and historical
     materials.
     3.18.2. Offices microfilming Air Force historical materials will coordinate microfilm plans and
     changes with the AFHRA/ISA to ensure compliance with established standards and determine if
     materials being filmed duplicate those already deposited at AFHRA. These offices will:
        •Submit completed microfilm plans in writing to AFHRA/ISA.
        •Describe the materials to be microfilmed in the plan.
        •Coordinate all plan changes with AFHRA.
        •Allow at least 30 days for plan evaluation.
        •Obtain approval from SAF/AAIA (after receiving approval and production specifications from
            AFHRA/ISA) through your records management function.

Functional Emblems—Unofficial emblems locally designed, authorized, and displayed.
Guidons—A pennant used by squadrons on all ceremonial occasions. Guidons are ultramarine blue wool
bunting, swallow-tailed, 1 foot 8 inches tall by 2 feet 3 inches wide to end of the swallowtail, and forked
10 inches. The Air Force yellow American Eagle design appears on the front of the guidon and on the
reverse side as if printed through. Above the design is the designation of the parent unit; below it is the
designation of the squadron. When the number of the squadron and the parent unit are the same, the lower

                     ABBREVIATED HISTORICAL REPORTING GUIDANCE

A2.1. General. Small field operating agencies (FOAs), independent groups and squadrons, and other
organizations relying on part-time or additional duty personnel to prepare periodic historical reports don't
have to comply with all of the requirements described in Chapter 3. The following outline lists some of
the key components and information to include in Abbreviated Historical Reports.

A2.2. Front Cover. Prepare as shown in Attachment 3.

A2.3. Title Page. Prepare as shown in Attachment 3.

A2.4. Security Notice and Administrative Controls. Prepare as shown in Attachment 4 if the histori-
cal report contains classified or otherwise controlled information.

A2.5. Narrative. Summarize briefly key developments, policies, issues, accomplishments, and lessons
learned that might be helpful to the institutional memory of future members of the organization or be of
long-term reference value to researchers (for instance, at the Air University) wanting information about
the organization.
     A2.5.1. Length. A few pages to several dozen, depending on size and mission of organization.
     A2.5.2. Format. You don't need to divide the narrative into chapters, but you must use a heading for
     each topic you discuss. The narrative does not require footnotes or endnotes unless you want them or
     MAJCOM requires them. Begin each classified paragraph with the abbreviated classification, warn-
     ing notices, and declassification instructions. Example: (S/NF/DECL OADR).
     A2.5.3. Content. Topics covered by the narrative include mission and organizational changes or
     reviews; major issues facing the organization; and significant projects, activities, and accomplish-
     ments. Attach key documents with details as supporting documents.

A2.6. Appendices. Appendix A includes Lineage and Honors data appropriate for the organization (see
Attachment 10). Appendix B is a Roster of Key Personnel (see Attachment 11). List any key metrics
and statistical data important to the organization's mission and responsibilities in additional appendices.

A2.7. Supporting documents. Amplify information in the narrative with key supporting documentation
as you do for attachments in correspondence or staff summary packages.
     A2.7.1. After briefly summarizing a topic in the narrative, indicate any attached supporting docu-
     ments (SD) pertaining to that topic by a parenthetical notation in the narrative. Example: "The agency
     then submitted a study report on its position (SD 12)." Number SDs in the same order as they are
     identified.
     A2.7.2. Typical supporting documents are staff directories, organization charts, mission directives,
     staff studies, policy letters, key correspondence and messages, activity reports, after-action reports,
     and statistical summaries.
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                    35


   A2.7.3. Arrange these documents in numerical order and prepare the List of Supporting Documents
   (see Attachment 15). Place this list following the narrative.
   A2.7.4. Prepare two sets of supporting documents: one to send with the narrative to the Air Force
   Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) for archival purposes and one to keep in the organization's per-
   manent historical file in accordance with AFI 37-133, Table 84-1. Write the SD number in the lower
   right corner of each page. Remove staples and punch holes; do not use tabs. See 3.6.22. for more
   guidance on handling documents.
   A2.7.5. If narrative and documents can be bound with a 2-inch or shorter screw post, in accordance
   with Attachment 18, you may combine them in one volume. Otherwise, separate the narrative vol-
   ume from supporting document volumes.

A2.8. Distribution. Send the most legible copy of the narrative and supporting documents to AFHRA/
ISA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424. Keep a second copy of the narrative and sup-
porting documents in the organization. Additional distribution depends on the organization's chain of
command. FOAs reporting to Headquarters USAF: Forward another narrative volume to HQ USAF/HO,
170 Luke Ave, Ste 400, Bolling AFB DC 20332-5113. Forward an additional copy to the Air Staff DCS
or the office in the Secretariat to which you report, if desired. For organizations reporting to MAJCOMs:
Follow the MAJCOM/HO's guidance. Always include a distribution list as the last page.

A2.9. Other Components. Add information required in the full-scale periodic histories described in 3.6.
if desired.

A8.1. Example of Narrative with Footnotes.
                                               CHAPTER I
   (U) American airmen had no experience before World War II with the special problems that face
peacetime military forces operating from foreign bases. When the war began in Europe in 1939, about
4,000 of the 26,000-member American air force operated outside the country. However, all forces were
based on U.S. possessions -- the Philippines, Hawaii, and the Panama Canal Zone--where they provided
aerial reconnaissance and "flying artillery" for Army garrisons stationed there to safeguard American
interests.1
   (U) The situation changed quickly after the fall of France in 1940. By the time the Japanese struck at
Pearl Harbor, Army Air Forces (AAF) fighter and transport aircraft had moved or were preparing to move
onto bases in Canada (Newfoundland, Labrador) and the Caribbean that President Franklin D. Roosevelt
obtained through his famed destroyers-for-bases deal with Great Britain. The great wartime expansion
began in early 1942 when AAF strategic bomber forces moved to England, while airmen who survived
the fall of the Philippines joined forces fresh from the United States in Australia and New Guinea to begin
a buildup that eventually smashed Japan into surrender.2 At war's end, nearly 1,000,000 of AAF's
2,250,000 men operated from nearly 500 major air bases on foreign soil.3

A8.2. Example of Narrative with Explanatory Notes.
   (U) The Twenty-fifth's first "maximum penetration" mission, on 18 January, marked the advent of a
new phase of combat in the Far East.* Moreover, this mission established the feasibility of certain tactical
techniques that had been the subject of considerable debate within various theater headquarters, as well as
in HQ USAF. The success of the tactics tested in combat during January by the 841st Fighter-Bomber
Wing in the raid on Blokmar settled the controversy over the use of "diffuse reaction" bombs and freed
large numbers of tactical aircraft for conventional operations elsewhere in the theater.7
   (U) Throughout late January and early February, the Twenty-fifth assisted in an extensive campaign to
reduce the more important islands still held by the enemy.+ For example, on the 21st, 25th, and 28th of
January, General Ironstone dispatched 432 low-level sorties against the beach fortifications at Sortomak
and Crustomon.8 Although losses were heavy--the 591st Group lost four F-99s and crews on the 21st,
two on the 25th, and three on the 28th--these missions opened the way for successful landings by two bat-
talions of Special Forces under the command of Brig Gen William F. Forsberg.9
______________
*(U) Chapter II, pp 80-92.
+(U) Sortomak, Crustomon, Idolan, Otia, and Thalia were the principal islands still in enemy hands.
Intelligence reports showed the last three to be less heavily fortified.
NOTE: Explanatory notes always appear at the bottom of the page. When endnotes are used to cite
sources, use symbols rather than numbers for explanatory notes.

                                    INSTRUCTIONS FOR NOTES

A12.1. Notes provide the primary means of identifying sources of information. In addition, authors may
use explanatory or supplemental footnotes for reasons of style or organization. For example, you may cite
in an explanatory footnote a long list of names that would clutter up the text.

A12.2. Note citations must be brief; however, cite all pertinent documents, using the standard formats
outlined in this instruction. Use abbreviations, acronyms, and office symbols whenever possible to
shorten citations.
   A12.2.1. Notes must contain all the data necessary to identify the source: type of document; classifi-
   cation; warning notices or special notations; downgrade and declassification instructions; originating
   unit and office; receiving unit and office; subject (if any) in quotes; volume, section or paragraph
   number; and date or date-time group. If the date is unknown, use "n.d." (no date). If an approximate
   date is known, use "circa" -- abbreviated "ca." -- plus the approximate date. Example: "ca. 15 Mar
   93."
   A12.2.2. Note citations will indicate if the source as been attached to the product as a supporting doc-
   ument (SD) by identifying the SD number in the citation. This identification will be the last item in
   the citation, use the SD prefix, and be underlined. Examples: SD SO-1, SD CHR-13, SD III-87, SD
   116.

A12.3. Number notes consecutively through each chapter. If chapter divisions are not used, number
notes consecutively through the entire text. Call attention to a note by inserting a number (or explanatory
note's symbol) in the text immediately following the appropriate clause or phrase, without spacing. Ele-
vate the number slightly (superscript). Punctuation marks precede note numbers.

A12.4. Cite the source of every direct quotation. Place note numbers at the end of indented quotations.

A12.5. Footnotes placed at the bottom of the appropriate pages are most uder-friendly to researchers,
especially on microfilm or scanned images. Use them if possible or unless exempted by MAJCOM/HO.

A12.6. Use endnotes, either placed after each chapter or consolidated in a single section after the appen-
dices, when word-processing software does not readily permit footnotes or if approved by MAJCOM/HO.
   A12.6.1. Cross-reference endnotes to their narrative pages by placing page references at the top out-
   side margin of each note page. (i.e., "Notes to Pages 1-3".
   A12.6.2. Single-space the text of each note. Indent the numbers or symbols five spaces. Dou-
   ble-space between notes.

A12.7. For textual matter within your notes (as distinguished from document citations), write in the same
style you use in the narrative. Place all direct quotations in notes within quotation marks, regardless of
length.
52                                                             AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004


A12.8. Provide a complete bibliographical citation the first time any source is mentioned in a chapter.
Use shortened titles for frequently cited works after the first citation. Identify short titles by placing them
in brackets immediately after the full citation. Example: Rpt (S/DECL OADR), Col A.B. Smith, 10 BW/
CC, "Report on Exercise Bingo, 5 Jan-28 Feb 1963," [hereafter cited as Smith Rpt on Exercise Bingo] p
15.

A12.9. Designate exact titles of published works (printed books, pamphlets, magazines, and newspapers)
by italics (for word processed material) or underlining (for typed material). Use quotation marks around
titles of chapters, articles, notes, documents, reports, and the like.

A12.10. Whenever possible, give the exact title, volume, and page number or numbers when citing a his-
torical report prepared in the field. Example: Hist (S/NF/DECL OADR), 20TFW, Jan-Jun 63, Volume I,
pp 2-14.

A12.11. Use the following format when citing a study that has been completed and bound: Study (U),
John C. Warren, Airborne Operations in World War II, European Theater (USAF Historical Study 97, Sep
56), p 42.

A12.12. Indicate the nature of the source (letter, memo, report, press release, and so on). If a term like
"Report" is part of the title, place it with the rest of the title. If it is used only descriptively, place it before
the title, abbreviated and followed by a comma. For examples, see paragraph A10.19.

A12.13. Classification markings and other restrictions must precede narrative statements in explanatory
notes. Source citations must contain the document's classification, downgrade and declassification
instructions, warning notices, and special administrative handling caveats. Place these markings in paren-
theses immediately after the type of document. Example: Ltr (S/NF/DECL OADR).
     A12.13.1. Source citations must explain or verify any differences between the classification or spe-
     cial notations:
         •Of the sources cited.
         •Applied to the narrative and other portions of the report.
     For example, if the cited information comes from an unclassified portion of a classified document, use
     the notation "unclassified extract" or "information used is U" immediately after the citation.
     A12.13.2. When using footnotes in classified products, mark each footnote with its classification, for
     instance, (U), immediately following the note number to comply with security portion marking
     requirements.

A12.14. Always include the subject when citing military correspondence. Provide a short, accurate
descriptive subject, placed in brackets without capitalization, if the subject does not appear on the docu-
ment.

A12.15. Indicate the place and date of publication, volume, and page numbers for information from a
published book.

A12.16. Separate individual citations by semicolons in notes that cite more than one source.
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                           53


A12.17. Use the abbreviation Ibid. (meaning "in the same place") only when the preceding note has a sin-
gle citation. (Note that Ibid. is italic or underlined.) If referring to all the citations in the preceding mul-
tiple-citation note, use "See note above."

A12.18. Place explanatory notes and cross-references at the bottom of text pages or within illustrations.
When using footnotes for source citations, designate explanatory notes using numbers. If using endnotes
for sources, designate explanatory notes by asterisk (*), double asterisk (**), dagger (+), or double dagger
(++). Example: "*See App 3." or "+See Chap V, p 28." See Attachment 8.

A12.19. These hypothetical citations demonstrate many of the combinations you'll need for notes for
periodic histories:
   A12.19.1. Attachments. Use this form when citing an attachment itself, rather than the letter, Staff
   Summary Sheet (SSS), or the like to which it is attached. Use the whole package as a supporting doc-
   ument. When citing the letter, SSS, or other item with attachments, use the style shown in A10.19.3.

                    BINDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PERIODIC HISTORIES

A18.1. Fasten all narrative volumes along the left margin. Fasten supporting document volumes along
the left margin or at the top. Bind volumes using three properly sized aluminum posts (ledger and binder).
Don't use ACCO fasteners. Don't use improperly sized posts that extend outward and tear other materials.
Proper posts fit snugly so that covers and pages have no free play but aren't bound too tightly. All vol-
umes must be no more than two inches thick.

A18.2. Assemble the cover as shown in Figure A18.1. below. Assemble with post heads inside the cover
to avoid tearing other materials in the file.

12 March 1998
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This interim change (IC) deletes Chapters 4, 5, and 6 and Attachments 19 and 20 (all of which have been
incorporated into the new AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry). This IC also
reflects renaming of the Air Force History Support Office, deletes a requirement for end of tour reports by
commanders, deletes the term monograph as a special publication category, allows more latitude in the
use of endnotes, and deletes the requirement for abstracts in periodic histories.
1.3. Air Force History Support Office. This agency (formerly known as the Center for Air Force His-
tory) is primarily responsible for researching and writing a wide variety of publications; providing infor-
mation and analysis to Air Force leaders, staffs, and other requesters; and sponsoring exhibits, symposia,
and other activities promoting the knowledge of air power and aerospace history. For more information,
see AFMD 50, Air Force History Support Office.
1.4.1. DELETED.
1.7. DELETED (See Chapter 1, AFI 84-105.)
Section C--Historical Studies
2.4. Historical Studies. Air Force Historians at all levels research and write a variety of historical prod-
ucts--both classified and unclassified--studying significant issues, policies, operations, programs, devel-
opments, doctrine, procedures, or comparable topics.
2.4.1.These products can vary widely in length and format depending on the topic covered and intended
audience. In-depth narrative studies of significant topics should provide thorough source citations for the
information presented and present many of the same features and components used in the preparation of
periodic histories (see Chapter 3). These include forewords, prefaces, contents, photographs, illustra-
tions, tables, charts, appendices, glossaries, indexes, bibliographies, and supporting documents. Titles
and subtitles should be descriptive, and covers should be attractive. In some cases, extensive studies on
topics of general interest may, if unclassified and cleared for public release, be published as books. In
addition to lengthy and fully documented narrative examinations of a topic (sometimes referred to as
“monographs”), historical studies can also take the form of chronologies, study reports, technical reports,
statistical analyses, bibliographical essays, and annotated document collections.
2.4.2.Historians at wings, centers, and other subordinate organizations must coordinate proposed studies
and final drafts with MAJCOM/HOs. Historians at MAJCOM headquarters, FOAs, and DRUs will
inform HQ USAF/HO of proposed topics of potential Air Force-wide interest and may circulate drafts to
HQ USAF/HO for review and comment.
2.4.3.Distribute final products as widely as possible contingent on the subject and, for classified studies,
the “need-to-know” principle. MAJCOM/HOs must approve distribution outside of originating wings and
centers. Always send at least two copies to AFHRA/ISA, HQ USAF/HO, and AFHSO/HOR. As appro-
priate, provide copies to other history offices in the Air Force, unified commands, other services, and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff that might be interested in the topic. Provide copies to functional offices at HQ USAF
as appropriate to the topic. Send studies and reports to the Air University Library as required by AFI
AFI84-101_512AWSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2004                                                                      65


36-2303, Documents and Publications for AU Library, and other reference libraries and document repos-
itories as appropriate. Submit studies on technical subjects to the Defense Technical Information Center
(DTIC) in accordance with AFI 61-202, USAF Technical Publications Program. Before distribution or
release to members of the public, submit final manuscripts to Public Affairs offices in accordance with
AFI 35-205, Air Force Security and Policy Review Program.
3.6.11.4. Write clearly and accurately in simple, direct, and grammatically correct language. Write
mostly in the past tense using the active voice as much as possible. Avoid military jargon and words not
commonly known. Define or explain scientific and technical terms. Limit your use of abbreviations and
acronyms in the narrative, explaining them when first used in the text and listing them in the glossary. Do
not use only office symbols in the narrative because they tend to change over time.

A12.5. Footnotes placed at the bottom of the appropriate pages are most user-friendly to researchers,
especially on microfilm or scanned images. Use them if possible or unless exempted by MAJCOM/HO.
A12.6. Use endnotes, either placed after each chapter or consolidated in a single section after the appen-
dices, when word-processing software does not readily permit footnotes or if approved by MAJCOM/HO.
