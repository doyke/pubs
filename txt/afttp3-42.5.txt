SUMMARY OF REVISIONS: This Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) doctrine revision updates
and clarifies information throughout the document including roles, responsibilities, and
relationships at all levels. Chapter 2 clarifies and further delineates functions in the Tanker
Airlift Control Center and theater Air Mobility Control Centers. Chapter 3 summarizes AE
Military Support to Civil Authorities and incorporates Contract Approval Review Board
certification requirements in accordance with Office of the Secretary of Defense policy. Chapter
4 expands on Special Mission Forces including Special Operations, marine expeditionary forces,
and combat search and rescue. Coalition support, detainee missions, and inter-fly agreements
have been defined. Unit type codes were updated and reflect changes in functions and interface
points. The Allowance Standard Working Group has replaced the Equipment Review Working
Group and, in Chapter 5, the Global AE Training Team and AE Steering Group have been
replaced by the Global Aeromedical Evacuation Integration Team. Professional training
includes the recommendation for trauma and/or Emergency Medical Technician training.

PURPOSE: The Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-42 series of
publications is the primary reference for combat support capability. This document, AFTTP 3-
42.5, provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for AE of patients across the range of
military operations, from steady state/peacetime engagements through war-winning operations.
Since AE is only one component of the larger Department of Defense (DOD) mobility airlift
enterprise, the guidance is designed to assist planners in the successful integration of AE into
airlift operations and interface successfully with ground medical operations.

APPLICATION: This publication applies to all Air Force military and civilian personnel
(including Air Force Reserve Command [AFRC] and Air National Guard [ANG] units and
members). The doctrine in this document is authoritative but not directive.

SCOPE: The Air Force AE system provides a critical patient movement capability that cuts
across traditional Service lines. Since World War II, the preponderance of AE patients generated
during wars and contingency operations have come from Army and Marine Corps ground

combat units. Therefore, it is important that the AE system integrates well with the medical
components of all Services, not just those of the Air Force. Moreover, during the past decade, it
has become increasingly important that the Air Force AE system continue to develop its
capability to integrate with components of our Nation's allies.

                           AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION (AE)

1.1. AE Mission.

   1.1.1. The Air Force AE system provides fixed-wing movement of patients requiring
   supervision by aeromedical evacuation crewmembers (AECMs) to locations offering
   appropriate levels of medical care. The AE system can operate as far forward as fixed-wing
   aircraft are able to conduct air/land operations. The AE system is designed to be flexible to
   enable it to operate across the spectrum of potential scenarios, including but not limited to,
   humanitarian and disaster relief operations, small-scale contingencies (SSC), major theater
   wars (MTW), and military support to civilian authorities (MSCA). AE is currently
   integrating their unit type codes, processes, and procedures into mobility operations;
   designing elements that can be plugged in to provide additional capability, when and where
   needed, and interface with joint, coalition, and special operations that are versatile in nature.

   1.1.2. The highly lethal potential of today’s battlefield, the reduced medical footprint, and
   the “evacuate and replace” philosophy, have made the AE mission even more critical than in
   the past. Moreover, the evacuation of patients by air to facilities offering required levels of
   care must compete with other critical wartime airlift requirements.

1.2. AE Concepts. AE can significantly improve casualty recovery rates by providing timely
and effective transportation of the sick and wounded to medical facilities offering appropriate
levels of care. The AE system provides: (a) integrated control of casualty movement by air
transport; (b) clinical and operational support personnel; (c) equipment for in-flight supportive
care and ground support operations; (d) critical care air transport teams (CCATT) to monitor and
manage specific patients requiring intensive care; (e) staging facilities on or in the vicinity of
airheads and air bases for the administrative processing and care of casualties entering, en route
through, or leaving the AE system; (f) command and control (C2) of all theater AE forces and
AE operations; and (g) support to the communication network between airlift C2 agencies.

1.3. Force Health Protection: The concept of force health protection (FHP) represents the set
of health programs that protect America’s fighting forces. Casualty care and management
support the warfighting commanders of all Services, coalition forces and civilians assigned to the
military through the provision of essential care in theater, followed by rapid AE to definitive
treatment without sacrificing quality of care.

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. Introduction.

   2.1.1. C2 functions exercised over AE missions are consistent with those for all air mobility
   missions and are conducted in accordance with the C2 processes described in Joint
   Publication 3-17, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Air Mobility Operations;
   AFDD 2, Organization and Employment of Aerospace Power; and AFDD 2-6, Air Mobility
   Operations. In contingency operations, AE specific items will be outlined in the operation
   order (OPORD) in Annex C Appendix 30 and general patient movement guidance in Annex
   Q. AE assets should be integrated within the inherent mobility structure established to
   support airlift operations through the Air Mobility Division (AMD) to the wing and down to
   each element.

   2.1.2. Patient evacuation from point of injury to initial treatment at a health care facility is
   the responsibility of each Service component. AE is not the only mechanism for movement
   of patients by air. Casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), a term used by all Services, refers to
   the movement of unregulated casualties aboard vehicles or aircraft. Medical evacuation
   (MEDEVAC), on the other hand, traditionally refers to US Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or
   Coast Guard patient movement using predesignated tactical or logistic aircraft temporarily
   equipped and staffed for en route care. MEDEVAC has generally implied the use of rotary-
   wing aircraft with medical attendants (MA). AF AE begins once a validated patient
   movement request (PMR) is passed to the AF component agency for execution.

   2.1.3. Evacuation of patients between points within the theater is referred to as intratheater
   evacuation, while evacuation of patients between theaters is referred to as intertheater
   evacuation. In both cases, en route care is provided by trained AECMs, qualified flight
   nurses (FN) and AE technicians (AET), the AF AE support network, and may be augmented
   by CCATTs or medical attendants.

2.2. Operational C2.

   2.2.1. Steady-state/Peacetime. Great strides have been made to standardize the AE system to
   ensure peacetime processes mirror wartime processes. This allows for the system to exercise
   its wartime infrastructure in peacetime and enhances wartime training. C2 of AE assets, to
   include tasking authority for AE and mobility forces, resides with the normal airlift and
   mobility C2 structure. Field and AE squadron (AES) operations will be conducted through
   operational wing C2 channels. The Tanker/Airlift Control Center (TACC) or Air Mobility
   Operations Control Center (AMOCC), or theater equivalent, provides C2 for tasking and
   execution for air mobility assets used to accomplish AE missions within their respective areas
   of operation. AE cells should be established within each of those organizations to provide
   the critical link between C2 of airlift operations and medical/joint interface. The theater
   validating flight surgeon(s) (VFS) and patient movement requirements center (PMRC)
   provide operational clinical oversight of a theater’s AE operations.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    8

   2.2.2. Steady-State/Peacetime AE Structure. Combatant commanders are responsible for
   intratheater patient movement (PM) within their area of responsibility (AOR). The joint
   command validates theater requirements and passes AE requirements to the AF component
   for execution.

2.3. Airlift Control Agencies.

   2.3.1. Tanker/Airlift Control Center (TACC). The TACC is responsible for tasking and
   controlling operational missions for all activities supporting USTRANSCOM’s global air
   mobility mission. TACC serves as AMC’s Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) for
   USTRANSCOM’s air mobility mission and its functions include: current operations, C2, AE
   and aerial port operations, mission management, flight planning, deployment, diplomatic
   clearances, weather, and intelligence.

        2.3.1.1 TACC AE Barrel. Barrels task resources to meet validated air mobility
        requirements, including airlift, tanker, and AE requirements. The TACC AE Barrel
        function tasks resources to meet requirements in their area of responsibility. Resources
        include AE crews, aircraft, and front-end crews. Barrel masters from AE, airlift, and
        tanker functions coordinate to task active duty resources. Access to AFRC and ANG
        forces is provided through a system of volunteerism. Requirements include appropriate
        alert postures as well as scheduled missions. Other airlift operations centers incorporate
        this function into the AE cell.


   2.3.2. Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC). The AMOCC, or theater
   equivalent, is each theater’s single C2 focal point for intratheater air mobility operations
   external to a joint task force (JTF). The AMOCC, or theater equivalent, provides centralized
   planning, tasking, scheduling, coordinating, and C2 for assigned and attached intratheater air
   mobility forces operating in the geographic combatant commander’s AOR. The AMOCC
   integrates intertheater and intratheater air mobility operations to efficiently and effectively
   accomplish the theater air mobility mission and enhance the goal of seamless global mobility.

   2.3.3. Aeromedical Evacuation Cell. The AE cell is the source of AE clinical and
   operational expertise and mission execution within the TACC/AMOCC. The AE Cell
   provides the critical link between C2 and operations and is the clinical interface with airlift
   operations and the PMRC. AE Cell personnel have extensive knowledge of flight
   physiology, airlift AE capability, and information technology such as, operational mission
   planning and tasking, scheduling, and mission monitoring of airlift and AE assets to support
   PM, as well as coordination with the Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC) for
   medical issues.

2.4. Contingency AE Structure (refer to AFDD 2-6, Air Mobility Operations). (See Figure
2.1.) Deployed expeditionary air and space forces are organized to ensure unity of command.
Deployed AE forces will be organized within the constructs of the Air and Space Expeditionary
Task Force (AETF) and will be tailored based on the size and scope of the operation. C2 of
theater AE forces in contingency operations will be defined in the warning/execution/OPORD.
AE assets may be under the operational control (OPCON) of the Joint Force Commander (JFC),
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                                                                                                                          9

through the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and, when not appointed as the
JFACC, the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) for Administrative Control
(ADCON). The AE commander is authorized to communicate directly with the joint forces
surgeon (JFS), who is assigned to the staff of the JFC.

   2.4.1. Joint Force Commander (JFC). The JFC is responsible for PM in the AOR. JFCs
   below the geographic combatant commander level exercise OPCON over assigned and
   attached forces.

    2.4.2. Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC). The JFACC derives authority
   from the JFC who exercises operational control, assigns missions, directs coordination
   among subordinate commanders, and redirects and organizes forces to ensure unity of the air
   component effort in the accomplishment of the overall mission. AE operations are an
   important part of the JFC’s mission, and the JFACC plays a critical role in successful AE
   operations. The JFACC (as delegated by the JFC) exercises OPCON of assigned or attached
   forces.

        2.4.2.1. An AE planner should be incorporated into A-5 of the COMAFFOR staff to
        outline, develop, and coordinate AE theater plans along airlift routes, including number
        and location of AE assets needed to support operational requirements. The planner
        should coordinate with the AFFOR SG to ensure visibility of theater medical
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                  10

     facilities/capabilities that may affect AE plans. The team may consist of AMC Director
     of Operations (DO) assets utilized in a reach-back status to support the operation and
     component until teams can be identified and trained.

  2.4.3. COMAFFOR Special Staff. For contingency operations, the COMAFFOR special
  staff may include a senior AE expert as identified, in conjunction with the AE force provider,
  AMC DO, to support the COMAFFOR on the special staff. The AE expert will have
  extensive experience in the AE system, airlift operations and plans, and will have attended
  mandatory training as part of AMC DO pre-selection and training requirements. In some
  cases, the COMAFFOR special staff AE person may be selected from the AMC pool of
  trained candidates and conduct business in a “reach-back” status in order to support the
  contingency. Normally, this person will serve as the advanced echelon (ADVON) support
  staff to assist with the development of the initial AE force laydown, C2, establish AE policy,
  and coordinate the interface with airlift operations.

  2.4.4. Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR). The DIRMOBFOR is a senior mobility
  officer who is familiar with AOR or the joint operations area (JOA), and who possesses an
  extensive background in airlift operations. The DIRMOBFOR serves as the designated agent
  for all airlift issues in the AOR or JOA. The DIRMOBFOR also exercises coordinating
  authority among the airlift coordination cell, the AMD air mobility element (AME), the
  TACC, the joint movement center, and the air operations center (AOC) in order to expedite
  the resolution of airlift problems.        Finally, the DIRMOBFOR, working with the
  JFACC/COMAFFOR, has a responsibility to ensure that AE assets are in-place, aligned in
  the airlift C2 structure, and that AE missions are planned and executed. Prior to a
  contingency the DIRMOBFOR is identified and an ADVON team is sent to evaluate theater
  requirements.

  2.4.5. Deputy DIRMOBFOR. An AE officer with extensive AE experience and knowledge
  of plans and operations may serve as the Deputy DIRMOBFOR. This individual may deploy
  as part of an ADVON, or as a member of the AMD. Deputy DIRMOBFOR candidates with
  AE expertise will be selected by the AMC DO and trained in the AOC and leadership courses
  and may attend the theater validation course. This individual, when tasked, will fully
  integrate into the AMD and assist the DIRMOBFOR in all other duties as required.

  2.4.6. AE Control Team (AECT). This team is located within the AMD of the AOC and is
  responsible to the AMD Chief, AOC Director, and DIRMOBFOR for current AE operational
  planning, tasking, and mission execution to the theater. Once a validated PMR is received,
  the AECT coordinates airlift and AE assets to meet AE requirements, tasks the appropriate
  airlift wings through the airlift control team (ALCT) and air tasking order (ATO), and passes
  mission information to the Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC). This team also
  coordinates airlift with AME/TACC/AMOCC to meet AE requirements. AECT members
  require an in-depth knowledge of AF instructions, aircraft configuration, and aircraft systems.
  The Joint Airlift Command and Control Course (JAC2C), the airlift planner’s course and/or
  an in-depth orientation of the TACC and/or AMOCC are highly recommended. A senior
  nurse on the AECT will be identified to coordinate AECM requirements with the AE
  Command Squadron (AECS) Chief Nurse, i.e., team size and proficiency. CCATT
  requirements are coordinated through the theater-validating surgeon.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                11


   2.4.7. Air Mobility Element (AME). The AME is the deployed liaison element of the TACC
   to the theater AOC, and usually resides in the AMD. A description of the AMD and its
   functions can be found in AFI 13-1AOC, Operational Procedures-Aerospace Operations
   Center, Volume 3, Chapter 8. Intertheater airlift assets normally will not be attached to a
   theater AETF but will remain COCOM of USTRANSCOM and OPCON of AMC. These
   forces may be organized into a Mobility AETF or AEW. Coordination of airlift, patient
   movement items (PMI) and assets required to support AE will be requested through the AME
   in the AMD. The TACC/AME may coordinate the use of theater AE assets to support
   intertheater missions. Theater AE assets tasked to support TRANSCOM intertheater
   missions will fall under the direct control and TACON of TRANSCOM /TACC during
   execution and depositioning back to the theater when specified in the appropriate
   OPORD/DEPORD/EXORD. Otherwise, theater AE assets tasked to support intertheater
   missions remain under the OPCON/TACON of the theater air component and carryout these
   missions through a supporting/supported commander relationship.

2.5. Air and Space Expeditionary Forces.

   2.5.1. Air and Space Expeditionary Wing (AEW). AE will deploy/employ in war as they
   exercise in peacetime. When the size and scope of the operation warrants establishing an
   AEW, AE forces will be aligned as part of the air and space expeditionary group (AEG)
   under the total AEW construct. AE standardization/evaluation will be integrated with similar
   Wing-level functions.

   2.5.2. Air and Space Expeditionary Group (AEG). When the size and scope of the operation
   warrants a minimal footprint, a smaller AEG may be deployed instead of the larger AEW.
   AE elements will then be aligned as part of the air and space expeditionary squadron under
   the total AEG construct. Normally an individual squadron or element should not be deployed
   by itself. When the size and scope of the operation warrants the presentation of a single
   squadron, it should deploy with provisions for commensurate support and C2 elements and
   will appear similar to an AEG although some C2 elements may be positioned “over the
   horizon” rather than deployed forward.

   2.5.3. Expeditionary Airlift Squadron (EAS). The Airlift Squadron is aligned under the
   Wing structure. Normally a mobility airlift squadron, AE, and airlift operations are
   integrated under the wing operations.

   2.5.4. Expeditionary AE Squadron (EAES). The EAES is assigned to an AEW and
   operations group.      The deployed unit type code (UTC) AECS integrates into AEW
   operations with the senior ranking officer designated as the EAES/CC on G-series orders.

       2.5.4.1. AE personnel assigned to the expeditionary airlift wing such as mobile
       aeromedical staging facilities (MASF), AE crew management cells (AECMC), AE
       crews, CCATTs, communications, liaison teams, and AE elements within a defined AOR
       should be organized within an EAES. The AECS ensures all elements are prepared to
       conduct AE operations as tasked by the AOC.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    12

       2.5.4.1.1. Air Reserve Component (ARC) Personnel. Typically, the JFC, through the
       JFACC, exercises OPCON over ARC personnel that are assigned or attached to the joint
       force. ADCON of ARC personnel remains with the ARC, except under a full
       mobilization authorized by Congress and directed by the President.

       2.5.4.2. The EAES will provide AE assets to support the wing operations center (WOC),
       and establish agreements with local medical treatment and base facilities for liquid
       oxygen (LOX), biomedical, logistic, and clinical training support as required. Requests
       for additional specialists to support AE operations in the wing or base structure should be
       forwarded up the wing chain of command. The AECS can arrange support requirements
       for follow-on AE forces, as required. In larger contingencies, there may be more than
       one EAES assigned to an AEW or AEG.

       2.5.4.3. The EAES/CC will identify officers in charge (OICs) and non-commissioned
       OICs (NCOICs) of each UTC or geographic location to provide on-site direction of AE
       forces. The deployed AES/CC or designee, will work with the OICs/NCOICs to ensure
       AFSC and operational proficiency training is accomplished at each location. The AECS
       also ensures memorandums of understanding (MOU) are established with other deployed
       operations such as the medical facility. MOUs should be used to integrate the AES
       assigned biomedical equipment technician (BMET) within the local medical treatment
       facility (MTF) for equipment maintenance and repair. Equipment requiring repair
       beyond the deployed capability will be processed to the PMI hub for maintenance

       2.5.4.4. Duties: The EAES/CC should designate a qualified senior nurse on the UTC as
       the Chief Nurse to maintain oversight of deployed nursing and proficiency issues. The
       Chief Nurse should have nurse executive (NE) or deputy NE experience. MAJCOM,
       Ops Group, or Unit standardization and evaluation experience is also recommended.
       Clinical training opportunities should also be identified and readiness skills verification
       (RSV) accomplished. AE life support requirements should be identified through C2
       channels and MOUs signed to ensure these requirements are met. AE communications
       will be integrated into the WOC, when the situation permits. AE issues/problems should
       be elevated to the EAES/CC and up through the wing to the AMD and DIRMOBFOR
       and COMAFFOR staffs for resolution. CCATTs are an integral part of the AES and
       should be integrated into AE operations commensurate with rank and expertise. The
       senior CCATT officer should be designated as “CCATT Clinical Director” to work
       CCATT issues with the theater-validating surgeon. At least one person on the AECS
       should be a Flight Examiner/Instructor to act as an advisor to the EAES/CC on
       standardization/evaluation issues.     This individual will also be responsible for
       maintaining the flight crew information file (FCIF) in conjunction with the
       wing/operations group.

2.6. Medical Oversight.

   2.6.1. Joint Force Surgeon (JFS). Appointed by the JFC to serve as the theater or JTF
   special staff officer responsible for establishing, monitoring, or evaluating joint force health
   service support (JP 4-02). The JFS is responsible for coordinating and integrating health
   service support within the AOR as well as coordinating intratheater patient movement
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                13

  support to the Joint Task Force Commander (JTF/CC). The JFS establishes patient
  movement policies and should coordinate with the USTRANSCOM, supported combatant
  command, and other Component Commands. The JFS should appoint a theater Medical
  Director who is responsible for the quality of patient movement clinical care provided within
  the AOR. The Medical Director appoints the theater VFS(s) who will support a joint patient
  movement requirements center mobilized to their AOR.
  2.6.2. Air Force Forces (AFFOR) Surgeon. The AFFOR surgeon is the designated medical
  advisor to the COMAFFOR on all Air Force specific health services support resources,
  including health surveillance, risk assessment, and other FHP issues. The AFFOR Surgeon
  provides professional oversight for deployed Air Force medical units, writes a supporting
  concept of operations (CONOPs), and establishes clinical policies in coordination with AMC
  as lead command for AE, supported combatant command, and other Component Commands.
  2.6.3. Theater Validating Flight Surgeon (VFS). The theater VFS works with the PMRC and
  complies with DOD and Service-specific medical licensing requirements. The VFS must
  have the appropriate knowledge base and experience sufficient to ensure proper medical care
  during transport as well as the ability to provide medical direction during transport for all
  patient types served by the patient movement system. The theater VFS must ensure
  compliance with applicable accepted practice standards for air and ground patient
  movement. Medical direction can be transferred from the theater VFS to a physician
  traveling with patients as a medical attendant or to a CCATT physician.
  2.6.4. USTRANSCOM - AMC/Command Surgeon. The Command Surgeon, AMC
  is responsible for oversight of quality of care provided worldwide by the AE system.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    14

                                          OPERATIONS

3.1. AE Across the Range of Military Operations.

   3.1.1. Introduction. The nature of threats impacting the AE system varies considerably
   within the spectrum of operations. In most contingencies, or civil disaster response actions,
   airlift will be the preferred means of PM. Service or civilian modes of transportation may
   assist with the movement of casualties from a forward location or immediately after an
   emergent event.

   3.1.2. HQ AMC is charged with the responsibility to operate the common-user Air Force
   fixed-wing AE system, to procure and execute commercial augmentation, and administer and
   execute the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). AMC has been given the overall responsibility
   as the AE lead command for the Air Force. AMC manages and operates the intertheater and
   AE sub-systems, CRAF, and provides AE elements and planning assistance to the theater of
   operations, in intermediate supporting theaters, or in CONUS. USAFE and PACAF are
   responsible for their theater-assigned AE units and associated airlift units. During
   contingencies which exceed theater AE capabilities, AMC will provide mission-specific
   augmentation forces to support increased theater requirements and will expand or establish
   the intertheater capability to support movement between theaters of operation, or to CONUS,
   as required.

3.2. Steady-State/Peacetime Engagement and Crisis Response. To support peacetime AE
and train for war, the AE system will align with operational airlift processes and routes and focus
on validated patients requiring in-flight care. AE will be fully incorporated under DO/Wing
operations. As part of the global mobility task force (GMTF), AE will have a presence during
base establishment. Theater AMOCCs and the TACC will execute the AE mission by
optimizing the use of available multi-mission aircraft; mixing cargo and AE on mobility
missions, and integrating AE requirements into cargo channel routes. Airlift for urgent and
priority patients will be tasked from alert AE crews, diversion of in-system select (ISS) aircraft,
or contracting with a civilian air ambulance (CAA). To enhance responsiveness, AE crews and
CCATTs should be strategically positioned based on airlift and key patient originating locations.

                               Use Any Mobility Asset In The System



   3.2.1. In order to support peacetime requirements and train for war, the AE system will align
   with operational airlift processes and infrastructure and focus on validated patients requiring
   in-flight care. The system will shift from routine scheduled C-9A and C-141 missions to a
   frequency and requirements-based system using all passenger-capable mobility airlift
   platforms. Qualified AE crewmembers will be multi-platform trained on aircraft systems and
   procedures to provide optimal in-flight patient care.

   3.2.2. Theaters will validate patient movement channel mission requirements through the
   existing theater unified command cargo/passenger annual validation process. Patients
   traveling as passengers in a Temporary Duty (TDY) status must be validated as clinically
   able to do so by the theater PMRC and granted duty pax priority. Associated costs with the
   use of seats on military lift by patients, attendants, and AE assets will be outlined in
   appropriate DOD Instructions (DODI) and joint publications.

   3.2.3. Patients requiring in-flight medical care, but not supported by the organic AE system,
   may be moved via other Service assets or civilian air ambulance (CAA). Outpatients and
   eligible beneficiaries needing air transportation, but not requiring in-flight care, can be
   moved by commercial airline travel, contract airlift, duty passenger travel, or in a space
   available status in the DOD transportation system, as validated by the PMRC.

   3.2.4. In the AE system, CAA should only be used when AE requirements cannot be filled
   with organic aircraft. In accordance with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy,
   Contract Approval Review Board (CARB) approval is required on all commercial
   conveyances contracted by the military to move passengers, patients, or paratroopers. AMC
   contract airlift will be CARB certified. However, non-CARB certified CAA may be used in
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    16

   emergencies to save life, limb, eyesight, or in the event that serious threat of significant
   deterioration in medical condition exists.

   3.2.5. AE Military Support to Civil Authorities (MSCA).

       3.2.5.1.    Those activities and measures taken by DOD components to foster mutual
       assistance and support between DOD and any civil government agency in planning or
       preparing for, or in the application of resources for response to, the consequences of civil
       emergencies or attacks, including national security emergencies. (DODD 3025.15)

       3.2.5.2. The Air Force AE system supports patient evacuations accomplished through
       the National Disaster Medical System. USTRANSCOM is the authority that validates
       the requirement to support civilian authorities with Director of Military Support DOMS,
       Federal Emergency Medical Agency (FEMA), and the NDMS. Once validated, AMC
       and TACC are the lead operational authority (LOA) for AE planning, coordinating, and,
       when directed, executing MSCA support. AMC/DO also provides trained AE
       coordinating officers and coordinating elements for MSCA from existing active and
       reserve component forces in execution of the Federal Response Plan (FRP) in the
       continental United States. AE assets required will depend on the size and scope dictated
       by the disaster or contingency and may be supported by in-place AE infrastructure or the
       deployment of AE assets to the disaster area.

       3.2.5.2.1. ANG AE assets, being part of their state’s Emergency Management Plan
       (EMP), may be mobilized and deployed/employed in a state activated status prior to
       federalization.

       3.2.5.3. AMC plays a key role in response efforts by providing experienced AE
       personnel, planners, and support staff. With proper authorization, AE personnel may be
       used to support local efforts at command and control centers, staging at existing airports,
       and/or AE liaisons at medical treatment facilities preparing patients for in-flight care.

3.3. Deterrence and Contingency Operations. AE forces are incremental and can build from a
small liaison team to a full theater AE system (TAES). The initial, expeditionary, AE assets can
deploy far forward, are mobile, and support the various medical ground units from all services.

3.4. War-Winning Operations. During support of war-winning operations, AE employs its
full capability, to include staging, AE aircrew members, specialty teams, and integrated
communications. During wartime, AE includes the movement of military casualties from
forward airfields to more capable facilities farther to the rear and, if required, on to definitive
care facilities. The AE system may be tasked to transport injured/ill special operations forces,
provide support for noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO), and/or evacuate injured/ill
repatriated US or allied prisoners of war (POW). On certain occasions, the AE system may also
be tasked to evacuate injured/ill enemy prisoners of war (EPW), detainees, and coalition forces.
Finally, during war-winning operations AE includes transportation of patients to and
redistribution within CONUS.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    17

3.5. CONUS Contingency AE. AE missions returning patients from the theater will deliver the
patients to CONUS. Staging facilities will be strategically placed to support defined airlift
routes. Additional medical assets may be required to support patients at organic enroute hubs.
Redistribution of casualties in CONUS may also involve a network of commercial airlift. For
wartime operations, the CONUS patient redistribution system and AE requirements will be
defined in the Integrated CONUS Medical Operations Plan (ICMOP) created by United States
Joint Forces Command.

3.6. AE Interface With The Joint Community. A PMRC is responsible for identifying MTF
capability, regulating patients to the closest capable facility, clinically validating, and
coordinating with service components for patient evacuation. This process matches the patient to
a MTF with the necessary capabilities and bed availability. PMRs are validated before being
turned over to the Service component for execution. The airlift operations centers may request
other destinations due to availability of airlift and routes to support AE. These decisions will be
coordinated with the PMRC.

3.7. AE Interface with the Patient Movement Process (Figure 3.2)

   3.7.1. Patient Movement Request (PMR). The PM process begins when the health care unit
   sends a PMR to the servicing PMRC (attachment 2, Patient Movement Planning and
   Execution Algorithm). The PMRC evaluates the request for necessity, acuity, and eligibility.
   PMRs are submitted to the PMRC by the service medical patient administration person in
   each facility and will be communicated through TRAC2ES for patient in transit visibility
   (ITV). Operational tracking of AE missions will be through standard air mobility automated
   systems.

   3.7.2. Patient Movement Requirements Centers (PMRCs)—Global, Theater, and Joint. The
   PMRC is a joint activity that is responsible for PM management and coordination. The
   PMRC validates patient movement requests, regulates patients to appropriate medical
   facilities for continued medical care, and determines the mode of transportation (air, sea,
   ground). PMRCs should exist at the joint level, as an element of the joint movement center,
   to ensure visibility of joint assets for PM lift options. PMRC staffing includes flight nurses
   (FN) as patient movement clinical coordinators (PMCC). One or more theater VFS are
   assigned or delegated by the theater Command Surgeon to work with the PMCC. Theater
   VFSs provide physician medical direction and clinical oversight of PM validation, transfer/en
   route care planning, and en route care, as needed, during AE. The PMCCs provide flight
   nursing and administrative expertise during validation and may be delegated validation
   authority by the VFS for routine patients using approved algorithms.

   3.7.3. Patient Movement Clinical Coordinator (PMCC). A PMCC is a flight nurse (FN)
   assigned to a PMRC who provides clinical and flight nursing oversight for clinical validation
   of patient movement requests. The senior PMCC may establish training requirements for
   PMRC personnel, conducts case reviews, develops PMRC clinical practice guidelines for
   personnel (FN or enlisted medical technicians) performing clinical regulation/validation in
   the PMRC, and defines the scope of practice for clearing patients by PMCC’s when an
   originating MTF flight surgeon is not available.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                                                                                     18

   3.7.4. Patient Administration Director (Clerk/Officer) (PAD) or the Medical Regulating
   Officer (MRO) is responsible for contacting the PMRC with PM requirements and submitting
   patient movement data. This individual manages patient numbers and bed classifications,
   determines availability of facility-based resources to assist with the movement of patients,
   and coordinates the use of those assets. The PAD/MRO serves as the liaison between the
   referring physician and medical staff, the patient, and the PMRC and is responsible for
   inputting patient data for PM requests.

3.8. Mission Coordination and Operational Considerations.

   3.8.1. Management of AECMs. Management of AECMs is essential for efficient system
   operations.      Crew management and tasking includes support to all aircrews, AE
   crewmembers, CCATTs, and other supporting medical augmentees. AE crew management
   will be integrated into mobility aircrew tasking orders, airlift stage management operations,
   and crew alert processes. AE crews will be alerted in the same processes other ACMs are
   alerted, i.e. aircraft commander (AC). It is the medical crew directors (MCD) responsibility
   to contact the command post, enroute, to find out the next mission’s AC and provide the AC
   with required information to ensure an integrated crew response to the upcoming mission.
   AE equipment will be considered part of aircrew equipment.

   3.8.2. AE Mission Priorities. PM priorities for AE missions will be derived from situational
   factors and/or individual patient clinical conditions.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    19

  3.8.3.      DOD Definitions for Theater Evacuation Precedence: Times begin once a patient
  is validated and stabilized for movement (Intertheater pickup will add 12 additional hours).
  The timeframes are expected response time, but can be negotiated with the lift agency (refer
  to JTTP 4-02.2, Patient Movement in Joint Operations). In contingencies, follow Annex Q
  directives for specific joint operation priorities.

  3.8.4.      Mission Coordination.        Once the mission has been identified, the
  AOC/AMOCC/TACC will task mobility wings for airlift, crews, and augmentation assets
  (equipment and/or specialized medical personnel support). The AE cell or AECT will pass
  mission information, including aircraft arrival and departure times, through the Wing as well
  as to the servicing PMRC and originating and destination health care facilities. The AE cell
  will coordinate ground transportation to/from the flight line. The AE cell or AECT will flight
  follow the mission and all operational aspects of AE.

  3.8.5. Unregulated Casualties. When security or operational conditions exist that would
  require casualties to be moved immediately, patients may be moved without prior PMRC
  validation. However, a VFS or medical authority will be identified to clear the patients for
  the AE environment. In each case, the originating AE component will attempt to alert the
  AECT of the departure of AE missions with unregulated patients. The AECT will then notify
  the PMRC.

  3.8.6. Patient Considerations and Preparation for AE. Proper clinical preparation for AE
  increases the likelihood of successful patient outcome. Originating physicians and staff, in
  consultation with local flight medicine personnel, should begin preparatory actions by
  outlining, to the PMRC the care plan the patient requires en route. Every effort should be
  made to identify age groups, (e.g. neonates) and clinical disease states that require or could
  require specialty care en route. Lastly, psychiatric patients must be carefully assessed for
  their potential for presenting an in-flight risk to flight safety because of their demonstrated
  behaviors.

  3.8.7. Patient Stability. Patients validated for transportation by air must be stabilized (secure
  airway, controlled hemorrhage, treated shock, and immobilized fractures) as much as the
  situation and resources allow. Potential interventions (i.e., IV or Foley catheter) should be
  initiated prior to flight, when possible. Patients not clinically stable due to severity of
  wounds or medical condition, limited medical resources, or time constraints may require
  advanced clinical capability while awaiting transport at an airhead or during flight. At times,
  the patient's clinical instability may be the very reason that they are being moved from a
  lesser capable facility to another of greater capability. The AE system provides qualified
  flight nurses and AETs who are augmented by CCATTs or other MAs, based on patient
  stability and condition.

  3.8.8. Patient Preparation. The physician should consider the care needed both in the air
  (such as availability of special equipment and cabin altitude) and at interim stops, and consult
  with a VFS as required. The physician has responsibility for patient classification, movement
  precedence, reporting, documentation, and preparation. The originating MTF will ensure
  patients are prepared for AE to include anti-hijacking security inspection.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   20

  3.8.9. Management of Patient Weapons. During contingency operations, weapons will be
  returned to the user Service or, in special situations (special mission forces activities)
  weapons will be cleared and transported in accordance with (IAW) aircraft regulations and
  Geneva Conventions. Explosive and hazardous items found with patients will also be
  returned to the patient’s Service. AE forces should outline a procedure if ordinance is found
  on casualties entering the AE system. Removal of weapons and munitions require host force
  protection personnel intervention.

  3.8.10. Patient Essentials. Patients will be transported with their medical records or
  evacuation battle tag, valuables, personal effects, and medically essential items IAW
  established regulations. Medical equipment and supplies required to support patients during
  evacuation are referred to as PMI and should be coordinated with the AE system in advance.
  The originating facility will be responsible for providing these items and should provide a 1-
  day minimum of supplies, except for PM from theater to CONUS and within CONUS where
  a 3-day minimum should be provided. While in theater, patients should also be transported
  with their chemical warfare/biological warfare (CW/BW) gear as applicable.

  3.8.11. En Route Care.

      3.8.11.1. En route care requires the use of state-of-the-art, lightweight, medical
      equipment to ensure the evacuation system is able to successfully transport a patient from
      the point of injury or illness to definitive care. Configuration and medical equipment
      interface with the aircraft is of utmost importance and is one of the competencies
      demonstrated by the AECM. En route care equipment and supplies will be standardized
      throughout the system and will comply with air-worthiness requirements. This will
      ensure rapid equipment exchanges and forward re-supply.

      3.8.11.2. Documentation. The DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation Tag, or AF Form
      3899, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Record, should accompany each patient to ensure
      appropriate care is documented during transport and serves as the legal record of patient
      care while in the AE system. These documents are primarily used to direct and record en
      route care. A DD Form 601, Patient Evacuation Manifest, should be completed for each
      AE mission if an automated manifest is unavailable. See AFJH 41-313 Aeromedical
      Evacuation Documentation.

      3.8.11.3. Clinical Considerations. Clinical considerations include standards of care,
      performance, and practice throughout the continuum of care as well as nursing guidelines.
      These are outlined in the Air and Surface Transport Nursing: Principles and Practice
      handbook available in all AE units.

      3.8.11.4. Standards of Performance. The standards of performance are the expected
      levels of function of a care provider, based on education, level of experience, and criteria
      of current position and Air Force specialty code (AFSC) requirements. AE assets, at a
      minimum will be proficient in their AFSC defined readiness skills verification standards.

      3.8.11.5. Standards of Practice. Standards of practice are the identified levels of
      accomplishment that focus on medical personnel and includes competence, experience,
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   21

     and education. The primary goal of AE medical transport is to meet the perceived,
     actual, or potential health needs of the patient while maintaining the continuum of care.
     Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards are
     applicable to patient care in AE. A qualified senior nurse will be identified at each AE
     element to ensure patient care teams are experienced and competent to provide for the
     type of patient care required. CCATTs co-located with the operations should be
     consulted to ensure their training needs are met. The senior nurse will also mix teams
     and shifts to ensure each patient care team meets standards of practice.

     3.8.11.6. Nursing Care Guidelines. AECMs/CCATTs must ensure that every effort is
     made to provide continuity of care for each patient. The MCD and charge medical
     technician (CMT) will supervise, and assist the other AECMs while they perform patient
     care. The CCATT physician is clinically responsible for care given to CCATT-assigned
     patients. See Air and Surface Transport Nursing: Principles and Practice handbook

     3.8.11.7. Physician Roles and Responsibilities. The following contains guidance and
     instructions for DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) physicians and health
     care providers on the proper procedures to follow when validating and preparing patients
     for AE.

        3.8.11.7.1. Referring Physician Responsibilities. The referring physician is jointly
        involved in preparing patients for AE with the nursing and administrative staff as well
        as the VFS. The referring physician, in partnership with the VFS, maintains
        responsibility for the patient until the patient is under the direct care of the receiving
        physician at the destination medical facility. Responsibility can be transferred to
        another physician when accompanying the patient. If any patient concerns arise
        during transfer, the AECT/AE cell will be notified for guidance or coordination. The
        AECT/AE cell may contact the PMRC or referring physician for further direction.

        3.8.11.7.2. MTF Flight Surgeon (FS) Responsibilities. The flight surgeon (FS) is the
        local authority for determining whether patients are physiologically ready for air
        transport. If one is not available, the theater VFS should be available for consultation
        The local FS is responsible for continually assessing an AE patient’s clinical status to
        assure the status is unchanged, particularly just prior to departure or if further
        stabilization is required. The FS may also determine if the patient’s category should
        change and adjust enroute clinical care as indicated to safely transport patient. The
        local FS provides flight medicine oversight of patients remaining over night at
        staging facilities unless the patient is transferred to other physicians for specialty or
        higher-level care.

        3.8.11.7.3. Medical Attendant (MA) Responsibilities. The majority of AE missions
        do not require MAs. MAs should only be requested in unusual cases because it
        diminishes the originating facility’s capability to care for others. AE crews
        demonstrate competency in routine and intermediate patient care and can adjust crew
        size and proficiency to support most patients. All MAs will be familiar with the
        patient and possess the level of skills appropriate to the patient's needs and are
        responsible for providing and coordinating patient care requirements with the
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     22

          MCD/FN. A physician accompanying the patient is the clinical authority for that
          patient's care. Documentation of patient care and medication administration in flight
          is the responsibility of the MA. The MA will remain with and accompany the patient
          to the health care facility or may be relieved by another competent caregiver.

3.9. Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT).

   3.9.1. A CCATT is a specialty care or critical care team authorized operational support status
   that can be added to the basic AE crew to provide a higher level of care to critically ill
   patients during AE staging and flight. When in flight, the CCATT physician is responsible
   for clinical decisions and care concerning the critically ill patient(s) and works under the
   operational direction of the MCD for mission management and the aircraft commander for
   operational management. In the event of potential threats to the aircraft or crew, during most
   contingency operations, casualties will be brought quickly to the flight line where they will
   be assessed on or near the aircraft.

   3.9.2. While en route, the staging facilities should be notified of any unusual or critical care
   support requirements during remain overnight or extended periods on the ground. The
   staging facility should arrange for patient care coverage to ensure the CCATTs, MA, or
   AECMs are allocated rest/recovery periods between flights. If they are unable to meet the
   needs of the patient, the PMRC, TACC, and aircrew should be notified in advance.

   3.9.3. Requests for CCAT teams come from the originating physician, PMRC VFS, or
   destination-accepting physician. CCATTs are tasked to augment theater evacuation
   requirements as directed by the AECT, AMOCC, or the TACC AE cell.

3.10. Special Considerations.

   3.10.1. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Patients. When a patient is diagnosed as having a
   terminal condition, the medical records must clearly state the patient’s condition. Almost any
   patient can be moved by AE if the proper care environment and specialized medical team is
   provided. AE personnel are not allowed to accept partial resuscitation orders. Terminally ill
   or severely traumatized patients, whose condition is so unstable that flight survival is
   unlikely, should not be moved. However, the tactical/resource situation in a contingency
   may require movement of such patients in spite of this recommendation. In these situations
   an AF Form 3838, Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Certification For Aeromedical Evacuation,
   should be considered. In accordance with AFI 41-301, Worldwide Aeromedical Evacuation,
   AE patients must have an order that indicates either full resuscitation or DNR. This order is
   annotated on the patient’s DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation Tag, must be signed no more
   than 72 hours prior to the originating flight and will cover the entire time in the AE system.
   During the aircrew brief, the MCD will review the DNR issues and procedures with the AC
   and aircrew to prepare for a possible death in-flight. Attending physicians should address
   DNR status of peacetime AE patients facing imminent death or classified as very seriously ill
   (VSI), recognizing that the stresses of flight may pose significant risk for precipitating death.
   The theater VFS will validate peacetime DNR patients for whom AE poses an unacceptable
   risk of death or injury.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                  23

  3.10.2. Apparent Patient Death In-Flight. The MCD/FN will advise the AC of an apparent
  in-flight death and notify affected medical facilities of the situation. In order to maintain
  patient confidentiality, no specific personal information is transmitted. The patient will be
  referred to by patient cite number only. If the next stop is not the patient’s destination and
  the aircraft is not in a critical phase of flight, the MCD may contact the AE C2 agencies to
  discuss options. If the aircraft is in a critical phase of flight or has landed, the MCD will
  contact the AE C2 agencies and make arrangements to have a physician meet the aircraft and
  pronounce the patient dead. The patient will then be off-loaded. If the next destination is the
  deceased deplaning point, the body will be off-loaded regardless of whether it is a military or
  civilian facility. Once the patient has been pronounced dead, continued airlift ceases except
  in unique situations and upon communication between the MCD/AC and C2 authorities. If
  airlift is continued, ensure a death certificate is included in the individual’s record.

  3.10.3.     Contaminated Patient Considerations.            Contaminated patients must be
  decontaminated before entering the AE system unless the combatant commander and
  USTRANSCOM/CC direct otherwise (AFDD 2-8.1). Decontamination/isolation and
  processing procedures must be in place to prevent spreading or further damage from
  chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield explosive (CBRNE) threats and
  ensuring the appropriate protection for patients, aircrew, and aircraft. All procedures must be
  reviewed with the aircrew by the MCD or flight surgeon. Patients with disease conditions
  resulting from biological warfare should be decontaminated and have appropriate treatment
  initiated. Caregivers at the referring facility must ensure that patients with communicable
  diseases are prevented from spreading the disease through the use of protective equipment by
  the patient and/or the crew, as deemed necessary by the theater VFS. A presentation of a
  large number of patients needing decontamination can overwhelm the AE system and
  diminish mission capability. AF Manual (I) 44-156, Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent
  Casualties, gives detailed information for moving patients suffering from biological warfare
  exposure.

  3.10.4. Medical Emergency in Flight. All in-flight occurrences will be reported to the airlift
  operations center through the AC. The AECT or AE cell will establish a phone patch with a
  theater medical authority if clinically applicable. Upon completion of the mission, the MCD
  will contact the AECT or AE Cell to coordinate follow-up actions and requirements. AFI 41-
  302 Chapter 5, AE Patient Safety/Quality Program, provides AMC policy on guidelines for
  implementation of AE event/near miss.

     3.10.4.1. When medical emergencies occur during flight, providers must take reasonable
     and necessary action, within their knowledge and experience, to preserve life and health.
     FNs will immediately start interventions following the most current advanced cardiac life
     support (ACLS)/basic life support (BLS) guidelines.

     3.10.4.2. The AC must be notified immediately regarding the gravity and nature of the
     situation. The AC and team will take appropriate actions, including landing at the nearest
     airfield that can both operationally support the airframe and provide medical support for
     the patient. In critical circumstances, the MCD may request the AC declare an in-flight
     medical emergency to expedite landing.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     24

                     PLANNING AND SUPPORT CONSIDERATIONS

4.1. Movement of Casualties. The movement of United States (US) casualties is accomplished
by all available forms of transportation, including ships, ground vehicles, and rotary- and fixed-
wing assets. Although evacuation of patients from levels one (front line operations/unit level
care) and two (basic resuscitation and stabilization) is normally a Service responsibility, AE units
may, depending upon the operational situation, evacuate casualties from forward airfields when
requested to do so by the combatant commander (See AFDD 2-4.2, Health Services for a
discussion on levels of care). AE planning requires the integration of Joint and Service specific
capabilities into the theater or JFC's concept of operations. Health service support considerations
include the tactical mission and situation, enemy and friendly capabilities, threat assessment, and
the theater evacuation policy. AE planners are an integral part of the airlift planning team and
should build appropriate AE support into the enroute structure. The AE planner should interface
with medical planner to ensure appropriate medical capability along airlift routes

4.2. AE Planning Factors. Medical planners must take many factors into account to select the
best or most appropriate means of executing each AE mission. Airlift routes -are identified in
order to establish potential AE plans.

4.3. Theater Evacuation Policy. The theater evacuation policy states the maximum number of
days (hospitalization and convalescence) a patient may be held within the theater for treatment.
Patients who, in the opinion of appropriate medical authority, cannot be returned to duty (RTD)
within the prescribed period are evacuated as soon as practical to the next appropriate level of
care for further treatment. The evacuation policy is normally 7 days for the combat zone and a
combined total of 15 days for the combat zone and the communications zone, in accordance with
guidance from the Secretary of Defense in coordination with the geographic combatant
commander and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Upon execution and during operations,
the theater evacuation policy may be adjusted based on various factors including the number of
definitive care beds available in, or deployable to, the theater. It is important to note, the
evacuation policy does not imply that a patient must be held in the theater for the entire period
identified in the theater evacuation policy.

4.4. Airframe Considerations. It is critical to identify the availability of various airlift
platforms that are appropriate for the volume and clinical requirements of the patients to be
moved. The AE Cell or AECT are resident experts in AF mobility airlift capabilities and system
interface.

   4.4.1. Organic Mobility Lift and In System Select (ISS). Organic aircraft are service
   airframe assets that have been obtained primarily through mission tasking or through en route
   diversion and mission reprioritization for AE use. Organic airlift is the major airframe
   component of expeditionary AE. Requirements can vary from obtaining a seat to moving
   ambulatory patients (or procuring a pallet position to move litter patients) to as much as
   procuring an entire aircraft to perform a single mission or routine channel mission. The
   airlift operations centers have visibility of airlift operating in the AOR and may divert a
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   25

   mission, ISS, to support the patient request. The AE cell/AECT coordinates AE tasking to
   ensure all assets are available to support the ISS mission. All regrets will be turned back to
   PMRC to determine alternative lift options.

   4.4.2. AE Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The AE CRAF program provides airlift
   platforms, upon contract activation, from commercial airlines specifically to perform/support
   AE missions. CRAF AE equipment is supported through “ship sets” that provide
   components necessary to convert the Boeing 767-200/200ER/300/300ER aircraft to a
   configuration capable of performing AE missions.

4.5. Airfield Capability. The mobility enroute structure and proximity of medical facilities to
the airfield determines AE laydown. Proposed onload, en route, and offload airfields must be
able to support the operation. The AE Cell or AECT coordinates with airlift operators to
determine operating restrictions such as quiet hours, no-light operations, approach restrictions,
refueling restrictions, time to upload and download patients, etc. In addition, mission planners
must consider flight line security, secured launch, and PHOENIX Raven requirements for
designated airfield locations.

4.6. Potential Hostile or Terrorist Locations. The requirements for security forces to support
aircraft during AE missions must be considered in the planning and airlift planning process. The
PHOENIX Raven program provides these specially trained security forces personnel to protect
AMC aircraft and will be included on all AE missions to locations designated “Ravens required.”
AECMs will carry weapons, when appropriate and authorized, to protect themselves and their
patients.

4.7. Base Operating Support. AE operations depend on integration with the Line of the Air
Force (LAF) to provide base operating support . This support is needed for AE units attached to
specific locations as well as en route transient support during patient evacuation through the
system and must be coordinated with appropriate agencies prior to deployment. These
requirements include, but are not limited to, transportation (including patient transportation),
messing and other consumable materials, water, fuels, cryogenics, LOX and other gases
(obtained from fuels or on a contract basis), billeting, latrines, showers, laundry, and security.
Additional requirements include: alternate generator support (primary generator capability is
included in allowance standards), fire protection, vehicle maintenance support, vehicle
decontamination, maintenance and logistics, life support, contracting, supportive
information/communications systems maintenance, waste management, and personnel
decontamination. AE UTC mission capabilities statements (MISCAPS) must be reviewed to
determine specific requirement especially in regard to communication and transportation
support.

4.8. Resupply. Sustained AE operations are dependent upon a well-designed resupply system
for the continued availability of consumable medical supplies and PMI at all en route support
locations. Planning for onboard or transportable therapeutic oxygen and any associated resupply
is essential to prevent mission delays. The AE planner should work with the medical planner to
outline logistics hubs and personnel to support LOX refill and PMI, BMET support in the theater
and enroute.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                      26

4.9. Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) Support. Equipment repair is essential in
the theater for routine maintenance and minor repair. Deployed MTFs (and potentially civilian
and coalition facilities) can support AE equipment repair and maintenance in steady state but not
surge periods. Therefore the AE planner should insert AE BMET capability into potential hubs
and align with local medical treatment facilities to ensure AE equipment is processed to meet
mission requirements.

4.10. Communications. Planners must ensure AE communication capability is integrated with
the mobility airlift and communication squadron network. Communication must be maintained
with subordinate deployed AE elements that may not be on or near an AF wing.

4.11. Ground Transportation. Most AE units deploy with integral transportation capability for
limited patient and crew transport at forward locations. AE planners should ensure proper
aircraft support equipment is available at the airfield, i.e. support pallets and loading systems.
The MTF is responsible for transport to the aircraft. Medical planners should determine the
availability of other Service ambulances and vehicles and, if necessary, establish contracts or
obtain host-nation support.

4.12. Determining Crew Support. It is imperative that planners ensure crew resources are
allocated appropriately and a designated replacement schedule to replace crews departing the
theater must be established. Consideration must be given to length of crew duty day,
augmentation of basic crews, required crew rest period, as well as ensuring transportation and
billeting arrangements. Aircrews and CCATTs should be positioned with MASF and AECM
stage management sites to allow for rapid response.

4.13. AE Interface with Special Mission Forces.

   4.13.1. Special Mission Operations and Rescue. Some special mission operations and
   expeditionary forward deployed operations, such as Special Operations (SOF), marine
   expeditionary forces, and combat search and rescue (CSAR) do not possess organic
   conventional AE capability and must identify requirements for, and obtain conventional AE
   support at forward airbases.

   4.13.2. Casualties. Evacuation of casualties within the joint special mission arena can be a
   particularly complex issue since these forces often operate in small, widely dispersed teams,
   and in locations not easily accessible. Flexibility and sensitivity to the particular needs of the
   special mission community, both clinically and administratively, is important to consider in
   determining how to best support their AE requirements. This includes instances where
   casualty identification must be protected and not entered into the regulating system. The
   special mission forces are responsible for care and evacuation of casualties from the forward
   location to the secure airfield where AE forces may be prepositioned to support the operation.
   The special mission teams will conduct the evacuation of patients on their organic vehicles
   and should not require any AE/CCATT interface. At the secured airfield AE/CCATT assets
   will assume responsibility for the casualties, freeing special mission medical assets to return
   to forward locations. AE assets will provide the support required to AE patients to reach
   definitive care. To prevent personnel with critical specialties from being evacuated from
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                  27

   theater, Special Mission Forces personnel may require a separate evacuation policy to
   facilitate reconstitution.

   4.13.3. Training to Support Forward Special Missions. Normally, the interface point with
   special operations is the MASF. MASF personnel have contingency operations training and
   in forward locations must be ready to perform AE missions, as well as provide limited
   holding for patients having been provided resuscitation and surgical intervention. A CCATT
   and/or additional crews may augment the MASF as required. AE missions originating at
   secure forward airfields may require AE operations in low light or blackout conditions.
   When supporting these forces, AECMs/CCATTs need to be trained in trauma training, low
   light/low noise, weapons, and survival in austere locations to meet special mission
   requirements. The planner should understand the need for limited resources and yet versatile,
   flexible capability to support special missions.

   4.13.4. Special Ops Critical Care Air Transport Team (FFQC4). Specialized CCAT teams
   train with the AF Special Ops Forces (SOF) to meet their unique mission requirements.
   These teams provide care to casualties transiting the SOF casualty evacuation system and
   provide continued trauma and post-operative casualty management aboard organic SOF
   aircraft and other opportune evacuation platforms. SOF Medical Elements (SOFME) are on
   operational support flying status, have been trained in SOF aircraft and attend the AE
   Technician course. If the situation warrants, conventional CCATTs are authorized to fly with
   SOFMEs on organic SOF aircraft.

4.14. Detainee Missions. Detainee missions fall under the responsibility of security forces and
are politically sensitive. Normally a CONOPs is written to outline roles and responsibilities. AE
forces should receive training in advance of supporting these missions and must follow security
forces guidelines at all times.

4.15. Inter-fly Agreements with MAJCOMs, Service, and Coalition AE Support. The Air
Force employs fixed-wing aircraft for the movement of patients and utilizes AECMs to supervise
medical treatment of those patients. Other services and coalition forces use various ground
transport, and rotary and fixed-wing aircraft for PM. They also use their own medically trained
crewmembers or MAs. US Air Force AE aircrew members may perform appropriate duties in
non-US Air Force aircraft if it is in the interest of the US Government and approved by both the
theater combatant commander and the controlling aircraft authority. In addition, coalition forces
may also integrate with AE forces. The AE planner will identify the potential need. The
operations center, in peacetime or wartime, normally works inter-fly agreements through the
LAF. In peacetime, MAJCOMs may require inter-fly agreements to be processed before AE
crews from one command can fly with others.

4.16. Operations Phasing and Force Sequencing. AE forces provide a rapid, flexible,
incremental, mobile response. UTCs are selected to provide the required level of command,
control, communications, patient care, and system support.      This allows planners to select
specific packages required to support steady state as well as contingency operations, or those
used for developing MTW operation plans (OPLAN).
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                         28

4.17. AE UTC Employment Concept. All AE UTCs are lighter and modular to optimize use
of limited airlift during the initial phases of an operation, without sacrificing capability. Some of
the equipment UTCs are man-portable to ensure AE can be employed in the very early stages of
a contingency. The concept is to employ an immediate, versatile, and flexible AE presence to
respond to the needs of the deployed forces. Personnel will need to be multifunctional and
capable of performing additional duties. After the initial buildup, the planners can augment the
deployed teams with more manpower and equipment (augmentation packages), as required, to
support more intense or ongoing operations.

4.18. AE UTC Selection and Utilization. AE UTCs are developed based on the building block
“plug-in/pull-out” principle, allowing planners to select specific UTCs capable of supporting the
range of steady state, contingency or MTW OPLANs. The UTCs are divided into three major
categories: command and control, patient care, and support, and are designed to meet highly
mobile and austere conditions. As workload changes or is projected to change, UTC packages
may be deployed or redeployed in small increments or combined with other UTCs to provide
capability needed.

   4.18.1. Command and Control UTCs: C2 UTCs, AECT and EAES, are outlined in Chapter
   2 and integrated with airlift operations.

   4.18.2. Patient Care UTCs.

        4.18.2.1. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Member (AECM). The AECMs perform in-
        flight patient care on any fixed-wing aircraft using medical equipment that meets
        airworthiness testing certification standards. Crewmembers are knowledgeable about the
        stresses of flight and effects of altitude on patients, basic trauma skills, and patient safety.
        AECMs are experts on the interface between aircraft systems and medical equipment to
        meet patient care requirements. Crews can also augment any ground UTC requiring
        additional clinical management or mission support capability. The basic AECM team
        may be tailored by the designated chief nurse to support the patient’s needs and
        requirements. During execution of the AE mission, AE crews and CCATTs are directed
        by air operations center in control of the airlift mission, i.e. AECT/AMOCC for theater or
        TACC for intertheater airlift.

           4.18.2.1.1. Medical Crew Director (MCD). The MCD is a qualified flight nurse
           designated and trained as the AECM responsible for overall management of a
           particular AE mission and provide oversight of nursing care. The MCD utilizes all
           resources on-board and works closely with all attendants and team members, and the
           aircraft commander to ensure the safety of all patients, passengers, attendants and
           crew. When a significant change in patient medical status or concern regarding a
           patient’s capability to tolerate the airborne environment occurs the MCD should
           contact the AMD/TACC AE cell to coordinate with the PMRC. The PMRC on-call
           theater VFS is available to provide clinical guidance. If the PMRC cannot be
           contacted, the MCD is the senior medical authority for all patient care issues and
           should render care within his or her scope of practice, available clinical resources on-
           board, and current standards of care.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                              29

     4.18.2.2. Critical Care Air Transport Team (CATT). CCATTs provide specialized care,
     in conjunction with AE crews, to evacuate critical patients requiring advanced care
     during transportation. Recognized as clinical experts, these teams are medically
     responsible for their patients and function under the in-flight direction of the MCD and
     AC. The CCATT physician is clinically responsible for care given to CCATT-assigned
     patients and may be asked to assist or advise on the care of the other patients. CCATTs
     may be staged at crew bed-down locations with fixed and/or mobile AE staging facilities.
     Teams positioned in staging facilities may augment the patient care capability of that
     facility. CCATTs may be assigned leadership functions within their assigned UTC and
     wing consistent with rank, training and experience. AE missions that require CCATT
     augmentation will be identified/validated by PMRC/AECT. The theater validating
     surgeon, in conjunction with the CCATT director, designated by the AES CC, normally
     coordinates individual CCATT mission requirements. The CCATT physician determines
     team requirements based on each mission and may pair and tailor as needed. The AECT
     monitors, tracks, and informs the PMRC on the use of CCATT resources.

     4.18.2.3. Aeromedical Expeditionary Support Equipment Package. When AECMs and
     CCATTs are deployed to forward locations early in an operation or to support Global
     Mobility CONOPS, a Base Operating Support (BOS) equipment packages including
     tents, generators, and a vehicle (when tasked) may be used to support their BOS
     requirements.

     4.18.2.4. Mobile Aeromedical Staging Facility (MASF). The MASF provides rapid
     response patient staging, limited holding and AE crew support capability to support
     SSCs, humanitarian and civil disaster response operations, and MTWs. The MASF is
     normally located at or near airheads capable of supporting mobility airlift. The MASF is
     designed to provide forward support with the smallest footprint. It is made up of three
     short crews, communications, liaison, and patient care teams. When crews are tasked
     from the MASF, they should be rapidly backfilled because the nurses and techs are also
     utilized for patient holding capability. The MASF includes a capability to receive
     patients, provide supportive patient care, and meet administrative requirements on the
     ground while awaiting AE. CCATTs should be assigned to every forward based MASF
     to enhance rapid evacuation. Additionally, the MASF equipment package contains
     sleeping tents to provide BOS for deployed personnel. The communications capability
     assigned to the MASF may be integrated into the tanker/airlift control element or
     operations cell. An individual may be identified to work with the aerial port element on
     the flight line to coordinate AE load planning, configuration, and operational support.

        4.18.2.4.1. MASF Augmentation. The MASF may be augmented with additional
        personnel and equipment to increase patient staging capability as needed.

        4.18.2.4.2. The Contingency Aeromedical Staging Facility (CASF). The CASF may
        be used at major inter-theater hubs to support the full spectrum of contingency
        operations and Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) operations including
        humanitarian relief operations (HUMRO) and homeland defense missions. The
        CASF interfaces with the AE mission and falls under the command and control of the
        medical group commander.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   30


  4.18.3. Support UTCs.

     4.18.3.1. AE Liaison Team (AELT). The Air Force AELT provides support between the
     forward user and the AE system in the form of operational and clinical interface. This
     interface may occur at locations that do not otherwise have AF personnel on them such as
     far forward/bare bases and shipboard. An AELT may be geographically separated from
     the other AF assets. The flight nurse on the team assists the medical unit in preparing AE
     patients for flight. The administrative officer is responsible for working with the airlift
     center and aerial port element to ensure the aircraft is properly configured and equipment
     pallets, patients, and AE support personnel are properly manifested on the AE mission.
     The communications personnel will be integrated into the airlift operations element
     supporting flight line operations or the WOC. Establishing a communication network
     with airlift operations is essential for rapid evacuation.

     4.18.3.2. Crew Management Cell (CMC). The CMC provides direct supervision and
     crew management for assigned, attached, and transiting AE crews and CCATTs in
     conjunction with the TACC/AMOCC, AECT and base operations, as applicable. The
     CMC coordinates requirements to include launch and recovery, life support, billeting,
     food service, transportation and administration for AECMs/CCATTs. In addition, the
     CMC may assist AECMs and CCATTs with aircraft configuration. This UTC manages
     and tracks equipment for AECMs and CCATTs. The CMC can be deployed
     independently or in conjunction with other UTCs to meet mission requirements. This
     UTC is for use in the tactical environment.

     4.18.3.3. AE Stage Management Team (ASMT). The ASMT is integrated into the
     AMCC and located at strategic airlift hubs or en route locations to support aircrews,
     equipment, and launch and recover operations. The ASMT manages assigned and
     transiting AECMs/CCATTs, aircraft configuration, and equipment to include CRAF
     support, patient loading interface, and re-supply of in-flight kits, medications, and patient
     liquid oxygen. Communications capability will be integral to the AMCC.

     4.18.3.4. AE Support Cell (AESC). The AESC provides communications and air and
     space ground equipment (AGE) maintenance support to all UTCs assigned to the TAES.
     The AESC should be staged with equipment at key locations, normally with the AECS,
     within the AOR to support AE requirements. Communications networks will be
     integrated with airlift operations. The AESC may have BMET support to ensure routine
     inspection and simple maintenance of AE equipment can be conducted in the AOR or
     within the theater. At sites with MTFs, a MOU may be established with these AE
     BMETs augmenting MTF teams. Major equipment repairs should be conducted at PMI
     centers with equipment swapped out to ensure theater capability is not degraded.

     4.18.3.5. PMI teams are composed of medical logistics teams and biomedical equipment
     repair teams. The logistics teams provide manpower for operational management of the
     PMI center. Duties consist of storage, reception, inventory control, issue, palletizing,
     shipping, and identification of equipment requirements. The equipment repair teams
     provide regional maintenance and repair capability for equipment in PMI centers and/or
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     31

      cells. Duties include scheduling and completing scheduled preventative maintenance and
      calibration, repair and maintenance services, and updating the PMI information system.

4.19. AE Mission Support Equipment.

   4.19.1. Patient Support Pallet (PSP). The PSP will provide litter capability on the tanker
   aircraft and expands litter capacity on some airlifters. The PSP is a modified 463L pallet
   with litter positions and seats and is centrally managed by AMC. It is designed to support
   steady-state theater operational requirements as well as PM on opportune airlift without
   integral litter capability. As a result, the PSP increases the number of MDS capable of
   performing AE missions. (See PSP CONOPs published by HQ AMC).

   4.19.2. SPECTRUM. The SPECTRUM patient care module is routinely used on operational
   support aircraft to support urgent, single patient requirements (including infant isolette). The
   aircraft usually require modification to accept the SPECTRUM. The base of the
   SPECTRUM contains oxygen, electrical outlets and suction to support patient care.

   4.19.3.   Patient Loading System (PLS).         The PLS is the preferred method for
   enplaning/deplaning patients in tanker and CRAF aircraft. However, the K-loader or
   equivalent may be used for patient loading if no PLS is available. While the PLS actually
   used in support of AE CRAF missions and operated by Aeromedical Staging Squadron
   personnel at strategic hubs, there is also a need for PLS to support tankers, and other
   opportune AE missions during day-to-day operations at forward locations.

4.20. AE Equipment and Supplies.

   4.20.1. Sustained medical logistics support for AE operations is essential. Reachback and
   resupply operations ensure sustainment of theater AE forces. Maintenance and refilling of
   liquid oxygen containers requires qualified LOX personnel. LOX refilling agreements
   should be coordinated by the EAES commander with the respective supporting operations
   group. Other items of interest are the shipment of in-flight medical kits and interface with
   prime vendor suppliers to fulfill deferred procurement items. Planners should identify supply
   hubs requirements and request additional support AE operations, i.e. additional LOX support
   personnel at airlift hubs and logisticians at deployed locations. The initial point of entry into
   the logistics chain will be at the attached wing level. Medical supplies may be supported by
   the proximal MTF medical logistics function. In large operations or contingencies, an
   interface with single integrated logistics manager (SIMLM) system may be generated.
   Requirements for class 8 supplies will be processed through the established theater system.
   Reachback to CONUS or home unit is not advised.

   4.20.2. Responsibilities.

       4.20.2.1. AE Equipment: The in-flight and theater AE environment exposes medical
       equipment to unique stresses. Equipment should be able to withstand environmental
       extremes of temperature and humidity, aircraft vibration, altitude and rapid
       decompression of the aircraft, and electromagnetic interference to and from the aircraft.
       Interface with the aircraft should not pose any safety hazards to the patients or aircrew.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   32

       Equipment items are tested and certified as airworthy and compatible with Air Force
       mobility airlift.

       4.20.2.2. As the lead command for AE, HQ AMC provides continuous review and
       oversight of the AE system, thus ensuring the AE force is appropriately supplied and
       equipped to perform the mission. AMC Director of Plans and Programs is responsible
       for integrating AE into mobility airlift and requirements for new equipment to support
       AE. AMC DO manages day-to-day oversight of AE equipment. The Allowance
       Standard Working Group (ASWG) consists of representatives from all AE components
       (active, guard, reserve) and includes aircrew members, nursing, administration,
       operations, communications, and logistics personnel. This group was chartered by AMC
       to be the AE equipment review authority. The ASWG reviews equipment package
       allowance standards, examines new equipment requirements, and coordinates with the
       Human System Center—Technical Planning Integrated Product Teams, Air Force
       Medical Logistics Office, and the Joint Readiness Clinical Advisory Board to facilitate
       standardization and compatibility with the joint community.

       4.20.2.3. The Air Force Medical Development Laboratory (AFMEDL) at Brooks AFB,
       Texas, is responsible for the airworthiness evaluation process for new or proposed
       medical devices for AE and coordinating with AMC. All medical equipment utilized
       for AE must be certified by AFMEDL as safe for use in aircraft.

4.21. Patient Movement Items (PMI).

   4.21.1. A major factor in the movement of patients through the levels of care is to ensure
   specific medical equipment and durable supplies designated as PMI are available. The PMI
   system supports in-transit patient care capability without removing equipment from patients.
   The system exchanges like-kind PMI without degrading medical capabilities, and provides
   prompt recycling of PMI. The system provides a seamless in-transit patient and/or
   equipment management process from initial entry into AE to the patient’s final destination.
   PMI system UTCs deploy in support of the AE system and are collocated with AE at key
   interface points to provide initial AE operational capability, to sustain AE operations, and to
   minimize equipment turnaround time. Equipment will be managed, supplied, and resupplied
   through the PMI centers and joint transportation and logistics systems. It is the originating
   health care facility’s responsibility to provide the PMI required to support the patient during
   evacuation. Services should plan, program, and secure equipment that is air certifiable to use
   in deployable platforms. In a contingency, the PMI cell may be collocated with the SIMLM,
   normally at a robust air and logistics hub.

   4.21.2. While the PMI program is mandated by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health
   Affairs), the USAF/SG has oversight responsibility, and AMC/SG has program management
   responsibility.

   4.21.3. MAJCOM and theater surgeons are executive managers of PMI within their areas;
   i.e., AMC/SG, PACAF/SG, USAFE/SG. Usually positioned at strategic AE hubs, PMI
   centers will store and maintain PMI while actively interfacing with AE operations.
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     33

                                           TRAINING

5.1. Objective. The overall objective of the AE training program is to develop and maintain a
high state of mission readiness of AE personnel for rapid employment across the spectrum of
operational requirements. AE personnel should be able to interface with airlift operations,
prepare any mobility aircraft for patient evacuation, and provide appropriate en route and in-
flight patient care intervention using certified AE equipment..

5.2. Responsibilities. HQ AMC is the lead command for AE as specified in AFPD 11-2,
Aircraft Rules and Procedures, and AFPD 10-21, Air Mobility Lead Command Roles and
Responsibilities. HQ AMC is responsible for standardizing aircrew flying training requirements
in coordination with other user MAJCOMs. The AMC Director of Operations (HQ AMC/DO),
is the lead command designee for training course requirements, training tasks, and coordinating
the development and publication of AE training standards. The Global Aeromedical Evacuation
Integration Team (GAIN) is the clearinghouse for clinical and operational issues that impact the
global AE system. The GAIN interacts with appropriate agencies, such as AMC SG for CCATT
and AE clinical guidelines, to develop, standardize, and evaluate programs and platforms in
response to customer requirements.

5.3. AE Aircrew Training/Qualification.

   5.3.1. The USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) located at Brooks AFB, TX is
   responsible for the formal school syllabus for AE crewmembers, which includes training in
   altitude chamber, survival, clinical, AE equipment, and ground training. Currently, the
   primary method of AE aircrew qualification is to complete unit-qualification training in their
   unit-specific mission design series (MDS). All AECMs meet requirements listed in AFI 48-
   123, Medical Examination and Standards, and complete physiological training.

   5.3.2. Qualification training may occur at the unit level until a formal AF school is
   established. Ground training covers aircraft systems, aircraft emergency equipment, life
   support, medical emergency equipment, and patient care procedures. Flight training consists
   of training flights that reemphasize ground-training areas in an operational environment.
   Students must experience a variety of mission scenarios during their training to include
   aircraft and medical emergencies as well as survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training.

   5.3.3. All available mobility aircraft are considered for patient transport. The existing
   aircraft certification program is designed for qualified and current AECMs to train and orient
   on aircraft (which they are not qualified on) prior to performing an AE mission. Minimum
   requirements for certification include aircraft emergency procedures and equipment, ground
   and in-flight safety issues, compatibility of AE equipment with the aircraft, and a ground or
   flight training period. Certification has the same training objective as qualification, except it
   does not require a flight evaluation (refer to AFI 11-2AE Volume 1).
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   34

5.4. AE Contingency Operations Training (AECOT) and Formal Training Courses.
AECOT is conducted at Sheppard AFB, Texas and provides initial and sustainment training at
various sites, including the Air Mobility Warfare Center, for all AE UTCs as well as UTCs
augmenting AE, such as CCATTs. The course emphasis is on readiness and preparation for
wartime or contingency operations and teaches personnel the entire spectrum of AE ground
operations. Training encompasses all phases of deployments to include predeployment,
employment, post-employment, and post-deployment activities. Formal training courses may
consist of patient care within the AE system, hazardous cargo certification, cargo processing,
pallet building, vehicle loading, aircraft configuration, aircraft load planning, and aircraft
loading.

5.5. Operations Training. Many courses are available for airlift operations training. The Air
Mobility Operations Course offers personnel insight into mobility operations. The AOC and
JAC2C courses are the basic training platform for airlift operations center personnel. The Airlift
Planners course is also available. Stage Management courses for scheduling and managing
aircrews will be required for the CMC and ASMT. Training sites providing practical, tactical
training scenarios, load-out training, and joint C2 relationships are highly recommended. This
cannot be overemphasized as AE personnel may deploy far forward. AMC is in the process of
developing an AE flight qualification program and leadership courses.

5.6. Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) Training. CCATT training requirements
are determined by the manpower, equipment, and force packaging (MEFPAK) manager
(AMC/SG) and the CCATT pilot unit. Training includes attendance at the CCATT formal
course at Brooks AFB. Physicians are trained in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and
advanced trauma life support (ATLS). Critical care nurses are trained in ACLS and Trauma
Nurse Core Course (TNCC). Cardiopulmonary technicians are trained in ACLS. CCATTs
training requirements are integrated into the AE system through membership in the GAIN.
Attendance in AECOT is required.

5.7. Professional Education.

    5.7.1. Flight nurses are licensed, registered nurses with a variety of clinical expertise.
    Trauma training and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training is highly recommended
    for all flight nurses in order to support our wartime mission. All nurses are responsible for
    clinical competency, based on the AFSC-specific (46F and 46N) series core competency list
    approved by the Director, AF Nursing Services.

    5.7.2. Clinical training for FNs and AETs is governed by the Readiness Skills Verification
    Program and Career Field Education and Training Program (CFETP). In addition, all AETs
    are certified as both an emergency medical technician (EMT) and BLS provider.

5.8. Currency Training. To maintain currency, each AECM normally maintains requirements
established IAW AFI 11-301, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program; AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
Aircrew Training, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and Volume 3,
General Flight Rules; and AFI 11-2AE Volume 1, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Training,
and Volume 2, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. These include minimum
number of flying hours, periodic written examinations and flight evaluations, maintenance of a
AFTTP 3-42.5 1 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                 35

current flight physical, and periodic completion of physiological training, life support, ground
egress, and medical equipment training.

5.9. Adopted Forms. AF 3838, Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Certification for Aeromedical
Evacuation; AF 3899, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Record; DD 601, Patient Evacuation
Manifest; DD 602, Patient Evacuation Tag.
