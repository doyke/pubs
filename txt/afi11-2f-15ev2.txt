                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2 and this
volume.
     1.1.1. Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) skills will be evaluated along with technical
     skills as outlined in the grading criteria in this chapter. CRM skills are imbedded within the
     appropriate grading criteria; the use of Form 4031 is not required.
1.2. Waivers. . Unless otherwise specified, AF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for this
instruction. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew
requirements, but may not approve blanket or group (two or more aircrew) waivers.
1.3. Procedures:
     1.3.1. Flight Examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 2 for
     conducting all flight and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and
     objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
     evaluation criteria.
     1.3.2. Recording devices (8mm, Video Tape Recorders (VTR), Digital Video Recorders, Air
     Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI), etc.) should be used, when available, to
     reconstruct/evaluate the mission. For the purposes of this instruction the term "VTR" will
     include any aircraft video recording device.
     1.3.3. Normally, the FE will evaluate within their aircrew specialty during flight evaluations.
     Any FE may evaluate any type of mission or qualification evaluation for either crew position,
     with the exception of the pilot instrument (INSTM) or qualification (QUAL) evaluations
     which must be evaluated by a pilot flight examiner. Any FE can administer an Emergency
     Procedures Evaluation (EPE). The examinee or FE may fly in any flight position/seat (to
     include chase) which will enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation.
     1.3.4. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
     conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
     accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. Higher Headquarters FEs and unit
     FEs may assist in mission planning/ briefing as tasked and be furnished a copy of necessary
     mission data, mission materials, and data transfer module/mission cartridge loads.
     1.3.5. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 When it is impossible to
     evaluate a required area in flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., in a
     simulator or by verbal examination) in order to complete the evaluation. The reason why
     required area(s) were not evaluated in-flight and the alternate method of evaluation used will
     be documented in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
     Qualification.
     1.3.6. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will include the
     examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified)
     and any required additional training.
AFI11-2F-15EV2 7 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  5


1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this instruction.
     1.4.1. The FE will base tolerances for inflight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
     stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the
     examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
     safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. When grading criteria specify that airspeed and or Angle of Attack (AOA) be
     evaluated and the flight manual lists only a minimum/maximum/recommended
     airspeed/AOA for that area, the examinee will brief the desired airspeed/AOA.
     1.4.3. The FE will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the
     evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the
     area. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite
     for the observed events and tasks IAW this instruction.
        1.4.3.1. FEs will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area
        grades. FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and
        when specific situations are not covered. FE judgment will be the determining factor
        in arriving at the overall grade.
        1.4.3.2. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted
        for specific events and instrument final approaches:

Mission Training Center (MTC) is not used, the EPE will be conducted in a Cockpit Procedures
Trainer (CPT). If a MTC or CPT is not used, the EPE will be given verbally. This evaluation
will include areas commensurate with examinee’s Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) training level.
     1.5.1. The following items will be demonstrated on all emergency procedures evaluations:
        1.5.1.1. Aircraft general knowledge.
        1.5.1.2. Emergency procedures. Evaluate a minimum of two emergency procedures per
        phase of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff, takeoff, cruise, and landing).

                                             Chapter 2

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General:
     2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2.
     2.1.2. Evaluation requirements are depicted in Tables 2.1. and 2.2 Areas indicated with an
     "R" are required items for that evaluation. A required area is a specific area that must be
     evaluated to complete the evaluation. All required areas must be included in the flight
     evaluation profile. However, if it is impossible to accomplish a required area inflight, the FE
     may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate method, in order to complete the evaluation.
     If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate
     method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
        2.1.2.1. With the approval of the Operations Group Commander, the pilot
        Instrument/Qualification Evaluation (2.2) and the Mission Evaluation (2.4) may be
        combined as a single evaluation. Unit Commanders, with coordination through the unit
        Chief of Stan/Eval may designate experienced pilots for this combined evaluation option.
        Evaluations flown in this manner must fulfill all current INSTM/QUAL and Mission
        evaluation requirements, including ground phase requisites. This combined evaluation
        will have a single expiration date IAW AFI 11-202V2.
     2.1.3. Publications that will be checked during the qualification evaluation are:
        2.1.3.1. T.O. 1F-15E-1CL-1.
        2.1.3.2. T.O. 1F-15E-34-1-1CL-1.
        2.1.3.3. Local Inflight Guide.
        2.1.3.4. Any additional publications specified in the unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
2.2. Pilot Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument
flight rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the
instrument/qualification evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include
approaches at airfields other than home or deployed locations. (USAFE: Preferably non-US
locations) This evaluation may be administered on any compatible training mission. Pilots may
complete their INSTM/QUAL evaluation with an FE occupying the rear cockpit. Minimum
ground phase requisites are:
     2.2.1. Open and closed book qualification examinations.
     2.2.2. EPE.
     2.2.3. Instrument examination.
2.3. WSO Qualification Evaluation. This evaluation is normally combined with WSO mission
evaluation for basic mission qualified (BMC), combat mission ready (CMR) WSOs. A separate
qualification evaluation will normally be administrated to basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) WSOs
who do not maintain qualification in the unit’s tactical mission and WSOs going through initial
qualification. This evaluation may be administered on any compatible training mission with the
AFI11-2F-15EV2 7 DECEMBER 2011                                                                    9


approval of the unit Chief of Stan/Eval and the Squadron Commander or Operations Officer's
concurrence. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
   2.3.1. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
   2.3.2. EPE.
   2.3.3. Instrument examination.
2.4. Mission Evaluation. Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC)
tasking satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. The profiles will be designed to evaluate the
training/flight position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the examinee. Initial
mission evaluations will be given in the primary DOC of the unit. Mission evaluations will
normally be flown using unit formations and tactics. Examinees will be evaluated in the position
of their highest qualification. If briefed, and at the FEs discretion, portions may be flown in
another position, but the emphasis is to have examinees evaluated at their highest qualification
level. Based on the examinee’s experience level, a wingman may be required to brief (to include
tactics) and or lead certain phases of the mission, but will not be evaluated using flight lead
grading criteria. Evaluations during exercises or exercise deployments are encouraged.
Evaluations during contingency/combat deployments will be given a last resort in order to
maintain mission qualification status. Note: BMC aircrew will only be evaluated on those
missions routinely performed. Examinees will only be evaluated on those areas for which they
are qualified.
   2.4.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.4.1.1. EPE.
           2.4.1.1.1. Normally a single EPE will be given to fulfill the requirements of the pilot
           MSN and WSO QUAL/MSN evaluations.
   2.4.2. Air-to-Air. This evaluation will include, as a minimum, one intercept, offensive
   maneuvering and weapons employment. Adversaries will simulate enemy aircraft, tactics and
   ordnance IAW AFTTP 3-1V2 and AFTTP 3-1 Shot/Kill. Dissimilar aircraft are preferred.
   Additionally, aircrew:
       2.4.2.1. Must have an operable radar.
       2.4.2.2. When weather or other restrictions prohibit D/ACBT, or Low Altitude Training
       (LOWAT), they may fly multiple intercepts.
   2.4.3. Air-to-Surface. First-look navigation and look-alike targets are encouraged.
   Navigation legs will reflect unit plans and tasking, with timing appropriate to the tasking. For
   those examinees who are certified CMR/BMC in nuclear and conventional tasking, the
   evaluation will emphasize only one scenario. Mission profiles should include actual delivery
   of practice or live ordnance. Ordnance deliveries may be dry if they can be validated. In
   addition, dry passes are permitted if, in the FE’s opinion:
       2.4.3.1. Accomplishing an actual delivery would significantly decrease the realism of the
       sortie.
       2.4.3.2. The mission profile allows a thorough evaluation of the examinee, but does not
       include range operations due to weather or airspace constraints.

2.5. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission
profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives.
Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or FE
judgment, to complete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded using
the evaluation criteria in Chapter 3.
2.6. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2.
Except for requirements delineated in Tables 2.1 and 2.2, specific profiles and or events will be
determined by the flight examiner. Subsequent evaluations (for example,
Instrument/Qualification, Mission) will include instructor portions during the evaluations. If an
instructional ride allows completion of all requirements for a periodic check the evaluation may
be used to update periodic evaluation providing all other requisites are completed.
   2.6.1. For units whose instructor pilots normally instruct from a chase aircraft, the examinee
   will fly a portion of the mission in the chase position.
   2.6.2. Formal Training Unit (FTU) and Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) Mission
   Evaluations. FTU and WIC instructor mission evaluation profiles will normally be IAW the
   formal course syllabus for any mission which the instructor is qualified to instruct.
2.7. LANTIRN (Night). VTR film may be used as a means of evaluating the tactical portion of
the evaluation.
2.8. Instructor Pilot Rear Cockpit Evaluations. An evaluation of rear cockpit landings will
be completed prior to performing rear cockpit landing instructor duties. These duties include
instruction for and demonstration of landings during initial qualification training, requalification
training, or additional training.
   2.8.1. Examinees will complete rear cockpit evaluations as per procedures in paragraphs
   2.8.1.1 and 2.8.1.2.
       2.8.1.1. All rear cockpit landing qualification evaluations will include satisfactory
       demonstration of: overhead and emergency patterns; a landing performed from the rear
       cockpit.
       2.8.1.2. IPs will accomplish the rear cockpit landing qualification during either the
       instrument/qualification sortie, the mission evaluation sortie or during another sortie as a
       requisite. OGV will specify when the rear cockpit landing qualification will be
       completed and identify procedures for completion of this requirement in the unit
       supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.8.2. When the rear cockpit landing qualification is evaluated during a separate sortie as a
   requisite for a flight evaluation, record "SPOT" in the Flight Phase block on the AF Form 8.
   Describe the purpose of the evaluation as "Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification" in the
   Mission Description section of the Comments block. In addition, FEs will document all
   discrepancies on the AF Form 8 in Section IV, paragraph b, under a subparagraph after the
   EPE discrepancies as follows: "2. Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification." If no discrepancies
   are identified, enter "None" after the subparagraph title. A subparagraph 3 would then be
   used for flight discrepancies. If a reevaluation is required, an additional "SPOT" entry will
   be recorded in the Flight Phase block on the front of the AF Form 8. Additional training will
   be documented IAW AFI 11-202V2.
AFI11-2F-15EV2 7 DECEMBER 2011                                                            11


     2.8.3. An initial rear cockpit landing qualification may be conducted independently of
     another evaluation. FEs will document completion of this Rear Cockpit Landing
     Qualification as a "SPOT" evaluation on an AF Form 8. Align the expiration date with the
     expiration date of the current evaluation during which the examinee would normally
     complete this requirement.

     NOTES:
     *Denotes critical area
     1. Airwork/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. This area is required for pilots
         receiving Instrument/Qualification evaluations. Units will determine appropriate proficiency
         maneuvers for pilot experience levels. Examples are, but are not limited to:
      1.       Aerobatics
      1.       Confidence maneuvers
      1.       Basic Fighter Maneuver (BFM)
      1.       Advanced handling characteristics
      1.       Formation (fingertip, tactical, trail)
2.          Unusual Attitude Recoveries. They will be evaluated during EPEs or if evaluated in-
     flight, will be performed with a Pilot FE in the aircraft.
3.        Either a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) or an Instrument Landing System (ILS), must be
     evaluated.

4.      It may be impractical to evaluate these required items on certain formal training unit (FTU)
     and weapons instructor course (WIC) instructor evaluation due to student syllabus constraints
     (e.g., BFM mission checks). Squadron commanders may approve these exceptions on a limited
     basis to validate instructor effectiveness. Document in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8.
5.           Annotate by Hit/Miss per event.
6.         Every attempt will be made to evaluate the full instrument penetration and approach. If not
     available due to ATC constraints (i.e. vectored off the approach) an enroute descent/vectors to
     final may be substituted for this requirement at the discretion of the FE.

         agencies.
     3.4.2.8. Areas 78 - 80. Not used.
  3.4.3. Air-to-Surface:
     3.4.3.1. When applying the criteria in this section flight examiners should first determine
     the effectiveness of aircrew actions to acquire the planned target(s)/DPI(s) (Area 81),
     then the procedures and effectiveness of the type event(s) attempted (Areas 85, 86, 87,
     and 88).
         3.4.3.1.1. “Event” is defined IAW the AFI 11-2F-15EV1, Chapter 5 event
         descriptions, i.e. Gunnery events, Unguided Ordnance events (e.g. loft, level, dive
         and toss, etc.), Precision Guided Munitions (PGM) events (e.g. LGB, IAM, etc.).
         3.4.3.1.2. HIT criteria is based on AFI 11-2F-15EV1, Chapter 5 guidance on
         “Weapons Delivery Parameters.”
            3.4.3.1.2.1. At all times, HIT criteria will be evaluated based on observed impacts
            (for actual weapons employment), attack parameters/procedures, and whether or
            not Desired Weapons Effects (DWE) were or could have been achieved.
            3.4.3.1.2.2. Flight examiners shall base their evaluation on range-determined
            scores (if available), airborne observation, and a post-flight review of recorded
            media (if available). IAW paragraph 1.6.3. the flight examiner may elect to
            award a higher area grade than warranted based on the evidence at hand; however,
            justification will be included in the comments section of the AF Form 8.
         3.4.3.1.3. All executed events will be evaluated whether planned or unplanned. Flight
         examiner judgment determines if reattacks are acceptable to offset the circumstances
         surrounding any particular event.
         3.4.3.1.4. Multiple Passes/Events. For evaluations that encompass multiple passes
         (of the same event) and/or multiple events (including those accomplished in one pass,
         i.e. double down), flight examiners may allow Q- performance in one pass/event to be
         offset by Q performance in another (thereby resulting in a Q grade for the event
         attempted or a Q for each event) if, in the flight examiner’s determination, the Q-
44                                                  AFI11-2F-15EV2 7 DECEMBER 2011


        performance did not reveal an actual or potential trend of sub-standard performance.
        EXAMPLE: Examinee performs a GBU-12 attack (LGB event), but misses due to
        weather; the examinee requests and flight examiner approves a reattack with a GBU-
        38 (IAM event). Upon post-flight review, the flight examiner determines that the
        examinee’s LGB procedural errors were minor and that the performance on the IAM
        event offset the deficiencies. The flight examiner would still record a MISS for the
        LGB event (and HIT for the IAM event), but provide justification in the comments
        section of the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph 3.4.3.1.2.2.
           3.4.3.1.4.1. U performance in any event may not be offset regardless of the
           number of total events accomplished or Q/Q- performance observed in other
           events.
           3.4.3.1.4.2. Unless there is a clear deficiency in a particular event that warrants
           downgrade, flight examiners should consider reducing the overall grade of the
           evaluation if the miss percentage of all weapons expended across all events
           attempted exceeds 50%.
     3.4.3.2. Area 81—Target/Designated Point of Impact (DPI) Acquisition:
        3.4.3.2.1. Q. The planned target/DPI was acquired in a timely manner (flight
        examiner judgment determines if a reattack is acceptable). For multiple target/DPI
        scenarios, all targets/DPIs were acquired on the first attack or with a successful
        reattack (flight examiner judgment determines if multiple reattacks are acceptable).
        3.4.3.2.2. Q-. The planned target/DPI was not acquired in a timely manner to the
        extent that the attack/reattack was degraded. For multiple target/DPI scenarios, at
        least 50% of all planned targets/DPIs were acquired in a timely manner to facilitate a
        successful attack/reattack.
        3.4.3.2.3. U. The planned target/DPI was not acquired. For multiple target/DPI
        scenarios, < 50% of all planned targets/DPIs were acquired.

            extent that weapons did not achieve HIT criteria. For deliveries of actual
            weapons, weapons impacted no more than %150 of HIT criteria.
            3.4.3.9.3.3. U. Demonstrated insufficient knowledge of weapons delivery
            procedures and committed unrecoverable errors in PPKS and/or HAT hierarchy
            selection/management and weapon’s correction inputs that precluded the weapon
            from achieving HIT criteria. For deliveries of actual weapons, weapons impacted
            greater than %150 of HIT criteria.
