                                  OVERVIEW AND POLICY

1.1. Purpose. This manual provides Air Force Emergency Management (AFEM) program
guidance on major accident and natural disaster prevention, preparedness, response, recovery,
and mitigation for higher headquarters, installation commanders, unit commanders, first
responders and emergency responders. It implements the Air Force Incident Management
System (AFIMS) and complies with the intent and guidelines in Homeland Security Presidential
Directive (HSPD) 5. It also provides policy guidance to prepare installation and unit plans and
checklists for major accidents and natural disasters.
1.2. Mission. The primary missions of the Air Force EM program are to save lives; minimize
the loss or degradation of resources; and continue, sustain, and restore operational capability in
an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary
missions of the AFEM program are to support homeland defense and civil support operations
and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities according to DoD directives and
through the appropriate Combatant Command. Major accident and natural disaster physical
threats are defined in Chapter 2.
1.3. Policies. This manual supports the AFEM program as required by Department of Defense
Instruction (DoDI) 6055.17, Installation Emergency Management (IEM) Program and Air Force
Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-25, Emergency Management.
     1.3.1. The President establishes national security emergency policy through the Department
     of Homeland Security (DHS) within the Continental United States (CONUS) and through the
     Department of State (DOS) outside the CONUS (OCONUS). In the CONUS, the Federal
     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) implements the policy through coordination with
     other federal departments, agencies and geographical combatant commands. These entities
     work together to prepare for emergencies, develop systems for response, protect essential
     resources and critical infrastructures, ensure continuity of government, and conduct training.
     Some emergencies are the responsibility of government agencies other than FEMA; for
     example, forest fire emergencies are the responsibility of either the United States (US)
     Department of Agriculture or the Department of the Interior (DOI). DoD assistance may be
     requested by a lead federal government agency regardless of the type of emergency.
     1.3.2. The National Response Framework (NRF) explains that the Robert T. Stafford
     Disaster Relief & Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes the President to
     provide assistance to State and local governments to support response, recovery, and
     mitigation efforts following Presidential emergency or disaster declarations.
     1.3.3. After a Presidential declaration of a catastrophic incident or emergency under the
     Stafford Act, he may direct any federal government agency including DoD, to provide
     support to state and local agencies.
     1.3.4. AF Policies. The AF must respond to major accidents and natural disasters involving
     DoD resources or resulting from DoD activities and assist civil authorities when requested
     support has been approved by the installation commander or higher headquarters. AFI 10-

  AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting provide detailed reporting requirements for all mishaps
  involving AF equipment or personnel. AFI 10-2501 states that commanders at OCONUS
  locations will follow DOS, COCOM, and MAJCOM guidance when assisting local
  authorities. Commanders at US territories and US possessions will follow DoI, theater, and
  MAJCOM guidance when assisting local authorities. MAJCOMs will coordinate with the
  DoI to determine appropriate response protocols at US territory and US possession locations.

                            PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS

2.1. Prevention and Preparedness Overview. AFIMS outlines Prevention and Preparedness
as the first two phases of incident management. The prevention phase begins before a major
accident or natural disaster occurs, and includes actions taken to detect, contain, and forestall
events or circumstances, which could result in an accident or incident. The preparedness phase
is a continuous process involving efforts at all levels to identify hazards, determine
vulnerabilities, and identify required resources to prevent, protect against, respond to, and
recover from major accidents and natural disasters.
2.2. Prevention. The National Resource Center defines prevention as actions to avoid an
incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention involves actions to
protect lives and property. It involves risk management applying intelligence and other
information to a range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence
operations; heightened inspections; improved surveillance and security operations; investigations
to determine the full nature and source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance
and testing processes; immunizations, isolation or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law
enforcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting, interdicting or disrupting illegal activity
and apprehending potential perpetrators and bringing them to justice. While major accident
preventive actions (such as hazard analysis, fire prevention, safety programs, and implementing
lessons learned) are specific in nature, natural occurring disaster preventive actions are more
general as they are difficult to predict. The following major accident and natural disaster hazard
explanations are provided to assist installations in defining preventive actions.
     2.2.1. Major Accidents. A major accident is an accident of such a magnitude as to warrant
     response by the installation DRF. It differs from day-to-day emergencies and incidents that
     are routinely handled by base agencies without the DRF. Major accidents may occur at home
     station, in transit, at deployment locations, or during any phase of training, civil support,
     humanitarian support, or wartime operations. Major accidents can contribute to adverse
     public reaction. Efficient and appropriate response activities combined with quick and
     honest communication on the situation and planned actions will help alleviate the public’s
     concerns. This action will aid in limiting negative reactions and facilitate returning the
     installation to normal operations. A major accident may involve one or more of the
     following:
        2.2.1.1. Hazardous Substances. Hazardous Substances include radioactive materials,
        Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC)s, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM)s, or explosives.
        2.2.1.2. Class-A Mishaps - defined by AFI 91-204.
        2.2.1.3. Class B Mishaps - defined by AFI 91-204 and AFI 10-206. Incidents may
        include facilities involved in fire or explosions, mass casualty incidents, or hazardous
        material (HAZMAT) responses.
        2.2.1.4. Grave Risk, Injury or Death. Installations must be prepared to mitigate those
        accidents and/or disasters that potentially create grave risk to the populace that could
        result in injuries and/or death. This manual details procedures to prepare the installation
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                     7


      and its personnel for that threat and outlines the appropriate prevention, preparedness,
      response, and recovery actions to take in the event of an incident or natural disaster.
      2.2.1.5. Major Accident Hazards. Installations must conduct an assessment of the types
      of major accidents that are a threat to their installation. Identifying the hazards allows
      installation commanders to prepare plans, checklists and train response forces to
      efficiently respond to these major accidents. Below are examples of major accidents:
      2.2.1.6. . HAZMAT. Air Force installations store and use hazardous materials
      worldwide. In addition, AF Installations may be located near storage locations and
      transportation routes (highways, rail yards etc.) for hazardous materials that may affect
      installation property, resources, and personnel. Storage and use locations include aircraft
      maintenance facilities, logistics warehouses, medical laboratories and research facilities,
      wastewater treatment plants, and hazardous waste accumulation sites. AF installations
      must be able to respond to incidents involving the transportation, transfer, or storage of
      hazardous materials or hazardous waste. HAZMAT incidents include organic and
      inorganic air releases, hazardous liquid spills, TIC/TIM spills that pose an immediate or
      potential health and ecological safety hazard to personnel, the environment, or the
      mission. The three levels of HAZMAT response are in Table 2.1 Regulations and
      policy regarding transport and storage of HAZMAT at both CONUS and OCONUS
      operating locations are intended to ensure safe operations. Table 2.2 reflects typical
      hazardous materials on an installation that can pose a hazard to operations and personnel.

  Level I    evacuation beyond involved structure. Poses no immediate threat to life
             or property.
             Involves greater hazard or area than Level I. May require limited
 Level II    protective action for surrounding area. Poses potential threat to life or
             property.
             Involves severe hazard or larger area than Level II. May require large-

       2.2.1.7. Aircraft Accidents. Aircraft accidents may involve DoD, coalition, and
       multinational or military aviation aerospace platforms and commercial airframes from the
       Civil Reserve Air Fleet and contract flight services. An incident that requires AF
       response may include aircraft, aerial target drones, and UASs.
          2.2.1.7.1. On Base Response. The installation must plan, equip and train to provide
          immediate, decisive incident response anytime an incident occurs on the installation.
          The installation mobilizes and deploys the installation DRF to respond to the incident.
          The incident commander (IC) may request recall of additional DRF resources to
          ensure lifesaving, rescue, suppression, and containment are accomplished at an
          incident.
          2.2.1.7.2. Off Base Response. Coordinate with local civil authorities if areas under
          civil jurisdiction are affected by the incident or the incident occurred in a civil
          jurisdiction. Installation emergency responders should immediately respond to the
          incident site to assist in saving lives and controlling the incident site by integrating
          with local responders. If the incident is far enough away where emergency
          responders will not be able to assist in immediate rescue and hazard mitigation then
          an IC and others should wait to be notified to respond to the incident site. The
          arriving installation DRF will coordinate and work with local authorities on the
          security and recovery of DOD assets when responding to the incident. The
          installation DRF must coordinate incident response and recovery operations with
          local authorities.
       2.2.1.8. Advanced Aerospace Material. Installations provide emergency response to
       airframes and weapons platforms containing advanced aerospace composites, such as
       depleted uranium, titanium and other HAZMAT materials. Composite materials present
       unique hazards and must be considered by the IC and emergency responders when
       choosing personal protective equipment (PPE) to be worn. Additionally, care in the
       handling and cleanup of these materials must be taken in order to prevent additional

     airborne hazards. Refer to the Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2;
     Annex A, Appendix 2, Tab C, Advanced Aerospace Materials (Composites) Checklist for
     detailed information.
     2.2.1.9. Nuclear Weapons Accident/Radiological Incident information is contained in
     AFI 10-2518.
     2.2.1.10. Accidents Involving Space Systems. Installations may be called on to respond
     to incidents involving space systems, including spacecraft, launch platforms, spacecraft
     fuel sources, satellites and other materiel. Incidents can range from accidents prior to or
     during launch and to downed satellites. Space systems can include radiological and
     chemical hazards, including TICs and TIMs. PPE selection will be determined based on
     the space system involved. Care in the handling and cleanup of these the materials must
     be taken to prevent additional hazards from being created, refer to AFI 10-2501; and
     AFMAN 91-222.
  2.2.2. Natural Disaster Hazards. Natural disasters include: severe weather such as tornados,
  cyclones, floods, thunderstorms, lightning, extreme cold and heat, winter storms, hurricanes,
  typhoons, and tropical storms; tsunamis; earthquakes; fires; wild land fires; volcanoes; and
  any other natural weather phenomena specific to the installation. Because natural disasters
  can simultaneously impact both USAF/Joint Base installations and civil authorities’
  jurisdiction outside the installation, it is important to understand that there are multiple
  military and non-military weather organizations involved in disaster response planning.
     2.2.2.1. USAF Weather organizations are responsible for comprehensive weather support
     inside the boundaries of all USAF and Army installations as well as joint installations in
     which USAF is the joint base lead agency. USAF weather organizations have sole
     authority and responsibility to create and disseminate the official forecast and all weather
     watches, advisories, and warnings for the installation.
         2.2.2.1.1. The local USAF Weather Flight [normally a flight within the host-wing
         Operations Support Squadron (OSS)] and a geographically separated USAF
         Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) responsible for the region provide cooperative
         weather watch for the installation according to AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-111,
         AFMAN 15-129 Volumes 1 & 2, AFVA 15-136, AFVA 15-137, and AFI 15-157.
         2.2.2.1.2. Installation weather watch, advisory, and warning issuance is primarily the
         responsibility of the regional USAF OWS unless the local installation weather flight
         sees the immediate need for a warning and issues for the OWS in the interest of time
         to mitigate the threat to personnel and resources.
         2.2.2.1.3. Weather support for installation-specific disaster response planning will be
         coordinated through the installation USAF Weather Flight and regionally responsible
         USAF OWS. Refer to AFVA 15-136, Air Force Operational Weather Squadron
         Areas of Responsibility -- CONUS, and AFVA 15-137, Air Force Operational
         Weather Squadron Areas of Responsibility [Worldwide] for OWS-specific regions
         and contact information.
     2.2.2.2. Outside of DoD installations, the CONUS (or OCONUS) national
     meteorological service is responsible for issuing weather watches, advisories, and
     warnings for the civilian population. Within the CONUS, civil authorities depend upon
 10                                                      AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


      the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Weather
      Service (NWS).
          2.2.2.2.1. The NWS provides local and regional forecasts and information for severe
          storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, extreme heat, winter storms, fire threats,
          tsunamis and solar flares to the general public.
          2.2.2.2.2. NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center at http://www/spc/noaa.gov provides
          valuable background information for natural disaster response planning.
          2.2.2.2.3. NOAA/NWS is responsible for supporting CONUS civil authorities in
          their disaster response planning activities.
      2.2.2.3. Should weather-related conflicts arise between USAF Weather organizations and
      the CONUS NWS [or OCONUS national meteorological office(s)] inputs to combined
      military/civil disaster response planning, the installation’s USAF Weather Flight will
      coordinate with the meteorological office supporting civil authorities as necessary to
      deconflict.

        persist and only emergency responders and damage assessment
        personnel are released to move about.
      2.2.2.4. Severe Weather. Installations will include severe weather plans into the IEMP
      10-2 for the hazards likely to affect the installation.
          2.2.2.4.1. Hurricane Conditions (HURCON) and Tropical Cyclone Conditions of
          Readiness (TCCOR). Specific to the AF, installations use HURCONs and TCCORs
          warning codes to prepare for an impending hurricane or typhoon. The information to
          guide installation HURCON/TCCOR codes provides arrival timelines and wind speed
          sheltering and evacuation decisions. Those hurricane and tropical cyclone conditions
          are listed in Table 2.3.
          2.2.2.4.2. Tropical storms and hurricanes that come ashore can also generate
          tornadoes. Installations subject to tornadoes provide notification of watches and
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                       11


           warnings using the Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS). A tornado
           watch is issued for the installation by the regionally responsible USAF OWS (see
           AFVA 15-137) when weather conditions are capable of producing a tornado. A
           tornado warning is issued by the regionally responsible USAF OWS (or local USAF
           Weather flight in time-critical situations) when a tornado is confirmed by radar or
           sighted by spotters. Personnel in the affected area should seek shelter immediately.
           Tornado warnings can be issued without a tornado watch in effect.
2.3. Preparedness. Preparedness is the range of deliberate, critical tasks and activities
necessary to build, sustain, and improve the operational capability to prevent, protect against,
respond to, and recover and mitigate the effects of incidents or accidents. Preparedness is a
continuous process. Preparedness involves efforts at all levels of government, between
government and private-sector and nongovernmental organizations to identify threats, determine
vulnerabilities, and identify required resources. Within AFIMS, preparedness is operationally
focused on establishing guidelines, protocols, and standards for planning, training and exercises,
personnel qualification and certification, equipment certification, and publication management.
   2.3.1. Preparedness begins before a major accident or natural disaster occurs, and includes
   planning, training, and exercising. Developing the IEMP 10-2 with supporting checklists and
   establishing tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to respond to all hazard incidents is
   vital. Base training ensures personnel are prepared to respond to an incident. The EM
   Information Program provides the base populace training on major accident and natural
   disaster procedures and localized threats. Exercises provide a forum for the installation DRF
   to test emergency response plans and TTPs. Installations are also required to maintain and
   test appropriate response equipment and supplies in case of a major accident or natural
   disaster.
       2.3.1.1. Planning. Accomplish a thorough review of Memorandums of Agreements,
       civilian agency plans, base installation support requirements, as well as any other tasking
       documents when developing or updating installation plans. The development of
       checklists and standard operating procedures must be part of this planning process to
       ensure the installation and response forces are able to respond to the hazards that threaten
       the installation. Planning prior to a major accident or natural disaster allows installations
       to minimize the effects of an incident. Use of the AFIMS during EM planning
       standardizes incident management. Installations begin the planning phase by completing
       a threat analysis, a vulnerability analysis, and a capabilities assessment. Information
       gathered in these assessments allows installations to determine what personnel, supplies,
       and equipment are required for prevention, detection, response, recovery, and mitigation.
       Using a risk-based approach, installations must consider the worst-case scenario.
       2.3.1.2. The IEMP 10-2 Template. The IEMP 10-2 is template located on the Air Force
       Portal/Air Force/Emergency Management/Publications and Plans. It contains lists of
       executable tasks commanders accomplish based hazards that could threaten installations.
       Each AF installation is required to develop an IEMP 10-2 according to AFI 10-2501.
       Annexes should not repeat the main plan. When EM guidance is included in another
       plan, such as the Integrated Defense Plan, Expeditionary Site Plan or War and
       Mobilization Plan (WMP)-1, Civil Engineer (CE) Supplement, reference the other plan
       but do not repeat the guidance. Basic IEMP template information is explained in
       AFMAN 10-2502, Air Force Incident Management System Guidance. Units and
12                                                        AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


     agencies must prepare detailed checklists to implement actions specified in this template.
     As previously stated, the pertinent IEMP 10-2 annexes addressed in this manual are
     Annex A, Major Accidents, and Annex B, Natural Disasters.
        2.3.1.2.1. . IEMP 10-2 Functional Checklists. Checklists should follow the format
        used in the template located on the AF Portal/ Air Force/Emergency
        Management/Publications and Plans, and should be based on tasks and requirements
        in IEMP 10-2. Checklist specify who, what, when, where, and how response and
        recovery tasks are accomplished. Checklists are dated and coordinated with the
        installation Readiness and Emergency Management Flight prior to publication.
        Reviews must be conducted at least annually, or when significant portions of the
        IEMP 10-2 have changed.
     2.3.1.3. Support Agreement. Commanders develop and execute Support Agreements
     (SAs) as directed in AFI 25-201, Support Agreement Procedures. All SAs are to be
     coordinated through the installation Legal Office before finalization and implementation.
     In addition, all SAs should be regularly reviewed to ensure they are current and complete.
     SAs are also known as "mutual assistance", "outside aid", "memorandums of
     understanding", "letters of agreement", "cooperative assistant agreement", or
     "intergovernmental compacts". An SA template can be downloaded from the Emergency
     Management Community of Practice under folder F: Publications and Plans/Mutual Aid
     Agreements.
     2.3.1.4. Civilian Agency Plans. Participation in local planning should not be limited to a
     single appointee. All installation responders units, that anticipate involvement with their
     off-base counterparts, should be fully engaged in the community incident response
     planning process. They should ensure their parts of the IEMP 10-2 do not conflict with
     local plans and how the installation fits into plans for receiving and providing support.
     2.3.1.5. Issues to consider for both major accident and natural disaster response planning
     are listed in Table 2.5.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                    13




Table 2.4. Considerations for Major Accident and Natural Disaster Response Planning
          Plans. Has the installation developed SAs with the local community to ensure
     1.   safe transport and handling of injured, or ill personnel to medical treatment
          facilities? These plans should address the handling of contaminated casualties.
          Plans. Are the needs of base personnel who own house pets and other
     2.
          domesticated animals included in the IEMP 10-2?
          Plans. Ensure Emergency Action Plans are completed, trained and exercised for
     3.   the safe storage or destruction of classified material and according to AFI 31-
          401, Information Security Program Management.
          Plans, Training, Exercises. Are the IEMP 10-2 and Integrated Defense Plans
          linked to consider the physical security of AF Protection Level Resources? Are
     4.   security forces required to remain in place and do they have the appropriate PPE
          for the major accident? Are national security assets moved to secure areas on the
          installation or evacuated?
          Plans, Training, Exercises, Equipage. How is the base populace informed of
          evacuation information? Has Public Affairs provided/coordinated on a plan to
          provide emergency information to the public and base community (plan should
     5.
          include use of INWS via Command Post, and other previously publicized
          communication mediums – radio, public web sites, social media, etc)? Are
          privatized housing units included in mass notification processes?
      2.3.1.6. IEMP 10-2 tasks must not conflict with other installation plans to ensure
      preservation of life, property, and the installation’s mission.
   2.3.2. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS). AFI 10-2501 requires AF
   installation to have systems to rapidly and effectively disseminate emergency information.
   INWS capabilities include signals or messaging appropriate to Force Protection Condition
   (FPCON), watches, warnings, evacuation routes, and other alerting information to meet DoD
   and federal warning requirements. Installations should incorporate all available resources to
   provide warning, which may include cable override, reverse 911, Network Broadcast System,
   or (add) existing public affairs communication tools.
      2.3.2.1. The IEMP 10-2 must incorporate all INWS requirements listed in AFI 10-2501
      and include any unique local procedures.
      2.3.2.2. The installation CP serves as the focal point for installation notification and
      warning operations.
      2.3.2.3. Installations should advertise the existence and use these systems regularly to
      properly educate the base and local populace of where to seek information during times
      of emergency.
      2.3.2.3.1. Each IEMP 10-2 will identify the notification and warning system
      requirements for the installation. Requirements must include: alert, warning,
      notification, and response. Incident notification and warning occur at all levels of the
      installation. See Table 2.5, for the types of notification systems used within the INWS.
 14                                                       AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


      2.3.2.4. Air Force Visual Aid 10-2510, US Air Force Emergency Notification Signals,
      provide specific incident warning signals associated with three major emergencies
      (natural disasters, wildfires, HAZMAT release) and attacks from hostile entities in
      peacetime and contingency operations. The IEMP 10-2 should identify this visual aid
      and include definitions for each warning notification category.
      2.3.2.5. The INWS must meet standards identified in Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-
      021-01, MNS Standards. INWS must support the installation’s AFIMS according to AFI
      10-2501.

   2.3.3. Unit commanders, through their unit EM representatives, conduct recurring EM
   training for unit personnel through the Air Force EM Information Program. Supplemented
   training is provided by the R&EM Flight for shelter management, contamination control
   teams, and EOC representatives. Unit commanders schedule assigned people for EM
   training courses, ensure they attend, and maintain documentation of training for assigned
   personnel.
   2.3.4. Air Force Emergency Management Information Program. This program consists of an
   initial orientation, as described above, and recurring education. Unit commanders and staff
   agency chiefs conduct recurring education throughout the year using materials provided by
   the installation R&EM Flight. The program emphasizes applicable hazards and protective
   actions. Consider the threat, mission, and assigned weapon systems when addressing the
   major accidents and natural disasters likely to occur at the installation. . Improve response
   capability by highlighting problem areas and corrective actions identified by inspections,
   exercises, or actual major accidents and natural disasters.
   2.3.5. Assign and train specialized teams according to AFI 10-2501 to ensure response
   capabilities exist to mitigate local threats and hazards. Team equipment requirements are
   tailored for the installation based on specific mission and threat in the employment
   environment.
   2.3.6. First and Emergency Responder Training. Training for major accident and HAZMAT
   incident response is conducted according to AFI 10-2501. It lists courses for the response
   members and directs training events and frequencies to support the IEMP 10-2 for the
   installation. Members complete these courses according to AFI 10-2501.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                        15


       2.3.6.1. Incident Commanders (ICs). Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part
       1910.120, Occupational Safety and Health Standards, Hazardous Waste Operations and
       Emergency Response, requires ICs to be properly certified and credentialed when
       responding to HAZMAT incidents. Non-CBRN/HAZMAT incidents requiring multi-
       agency response, the incident commanders must meet NIMS Incident Commander
       training requirements.
       2.3.6.2. Investigation Board Members. Personnel assigned to the safety investigation
       board and incident investigation board must be suitably trained and equipped to enter any
       site where HAZMAT (including biohazards posed by blood-borne pathogens) may pose a
       threat to their safety.
2.4. Risk Management Process. The EM all-hazards Risk Management Process (RMP)
identified in AFI 10-2501 compliments the Integrated Defense Risk Management Process
(IDRMP) found in AFI 31-101, and is comprised of three assessments providing the installation
commander with an objective risk management decision tool to make informed risk decisions.
Refer to AFI 31-101, ch.3 for details on developing Risk Management methodology. The
foundation of the RMP is comprised of three annual assessments: the Hazard Assessment, the
Vulnerability Assessment, and the Capabilities Assessment which are conducted in concert with
other installation working groups
   2.4.1. Hazard Assessment. A Hazard Assessment identifies all natural and man-made
   threats to the installation. The hazard assessment identifies an installation’s facilities,
   roadways, and other infrastructure subject to potential exposure or to the physical effects of a
   natural or man-made disaster. The hazard assessment considers all hazard types, the
   likelihood of each type of hazard occurring, and the vulnerability of the supported missions,
   assigned personnel, property, the environment, and the installation as a whole to these
   hazards. Mitigation actions are necessary for identified hazards. The hazard assessment
   allows installations to prioritize and plan response, recovery, and continuing mitigation
   efforts. Hazard assessments serve as one of the foundational components for effective
   emergency management. Results of the hazard assessment directly affect the planning for
   activities such as resource management, capability development, public education, and
   training and exercises.
       2.4.1.1. All installations perform hazard assessments in conjunction with other programs
       (e.g. AT, water, CIP). Installations identify all hazards, likelihood of the hazard
       occurring, and how the hazard affects the installation. The steps in hazard assessment
       include:
          2.4.1.1.1. Research and identify the natural or man-made hazards or threats to your
          installation.
          2.4.1.1.2. Review historical weather data, plans of past natural disasters, and
          projected seasonal natural disasters. FEMA also has several tools to assist in
          identifying hazards in your area.
          2.4.1.1.3. Consider the possibility of toxic industrial material facilities located off the
          installation and if there is any historical data concerning the facility.
          2.4.1.1.4. Consider the full range of known or estimated terrorist capabilities and
          possibilities of non-hostile incidents.
 16                                                            AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


           2.4.1.1.5. Evaluate each hazard for severity and frequency by determining how often
           these hazards affect the installation and what actions may help reduce their severity.
           2.4.1.1.6. The steps in hazard assessments are shown in Table 2.7.

Table 2.6. Hazard Assessment Steps
      1. Identify and characterize the hazards.
      Identify types of natural disasters the installation is susceptible to (i.e., tornadoes,
      blizzards etc.) Identify types of major accidents (i.e., aircraft, munitions, fuel
      storage, etc.)
      What additional hazards do they project?
      2. Evaluate/review each hazard for severity and frequency and historical data
      frequency.
      What preventive/mitigation actions may help reduce the severity of these hazards?
      3. Determine operational mission implications and costs of direct and indirect
      effects of identified hazards.
      4. Installation commander determines acceptable risks.
      What level of damage or mission loss can be accepted?
      5. Identify risk reduction opportunities.
      This step takes mitigation actions to reduce the threat or impact of the hazard.
   2.4.2. Vulnerability Assessment (VA). The installation VA provides a quantitative estimate
   of how vulnerable the installation is to each hazard identified in the Hazard Assessment. All
   installations identify emergency management vulnerabilities in conjunction with the AT and
   Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)/Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM) programs
   and address the broad range of hazards to the installation, mission critical assets, and its
   personnel using DoD Vulnerability Assessment Benchmarks, Service AT and CIP/CARM
   specific benchmarks, as required. All VAs are cross-functional activities requiring the
   involvement of several installation agencies (e.g. CE, MDG, SF, OSI, etc.). The other
   program VAs are analyzed with the EM Program providing clear understanding of the threat
   spectrum effecting the installation and reducing equipment and funding redundancies.
       2.4.2.1. Identify impacts hazards will have on the installation to include: mission,
       personnel, equipment, damage to facilities and infrastructure, life safety, public health,
       and recovery concerns.
       2.4.2.2. Identify appropriate courses of action to address vulnerabilities and solutions for
       enhanced protection of DoD personnel and resources. Apply installation commander risk
       management decisions to prioritize and focus mitigation efforts.
       2.4.2.3. Refer to AFI 31-101, ch.3 for details on developing Risk Management
       methodology.
       2.4.2.4. Estimate the impact of hazards and threats by identifying and quantifying
       missions or areas that could potentially be affected, include special events in the process.
       2.4.2.5. Analyze vulnerability of the installation’s critical assets, missions, and identify
       mitigation options to reduce or eliminate the vulnerabilities.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                      17


   2.4.3. Capability Assessment. A capabilities assessment is an installation’s evaluation to
   identify capabilities for response to a major accident or natural disaster. The capabilities
   assessment identifies response resources and limiting factors of mission- derived tasks with
   associated conditions and standards. Capability assessments serve as one of the foundations
   for effective EM activities and include: planning, resource management, capability
   development, public education, and training and exercise. Steps for a capabilities assessment
   are listed in Table 2.8
         2.4.3.1. Capability Assessments measure the installation’s current level of capability to
         prepare for the hazards identified in the Hazard Assessment, and employ mitigation
         practices identified in the Vulnerability Assessment. Installation Capability Assessments
         will consider preparedness, response, and recovery processes. Objectives of the
         Capability Assessment are to:
            2.4.3.1.1. Identify equipment required for response to each hazard and vulnerability.
            List resources by type and include in the asset capability report. Identify each
            organizations mission essential tasks (METs) and functions assigned to each
            organization.
            2.4.3.1.2. Identify first and emergency responders necessary for response to
            identified hazards. If there is a shortfall, consider if local authorities can provide
            those resources.
            2.4.3.1.3. Review policy, guidance, and planning documents to ensure they
            adequately address the response to and recovery from identified hazards/threats.
            2.4.3.1.4. Identify and list personnel with EM responsibilities, and categorize them
            as emergency responders, specialized teams, critical personnel, essential personnel,
            and other personnel.
            2.4.3.1.5. Identify if the INWS is able to warn all personnel immediately, but no
            longer than 10 minutes, according to the requirements in DoDI 6055.17.
            2.4.3.1.6. Assess if the command and control process is adequate to support and
            control resources needed for the identified hazards and threats.
            2.4.3.1.7. Identify costs required to increase capabilities or mitigate identified
            vulnerabilities.

Table 2.7. Capabilities Assessment Steps
    1.    Analyze the installation’s Threat Assessment and Vulnerability Assessment.
    2.    Capture information on specific hazards applicable to the installation.
    3.    List installation resources.
    4.    List installation personnel with a mission-essential task responsibility for EM.
    5.    Identify shortfalls: equipment, resources, and personnel.
    6.    Report shortfalls and develop funding requirements as necessary.
2.5. Base Support Installation (BSI) and Incident Support Bases (ISB). A BSI is a military
installation within the US, its territories, or possessions controlled by any Service or agency, in
or near an actual or projected domestic emergency operational area. BSIs are designated by the
DoD to provide military support for DoD. ISBs are facilities that support FEMA incident
 18                                                            AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


response operations and logistics, and are frequently military installations, designated after
request to DOD.
   2.5.1. The Secretary of Defense designates the appropriate BSI. Locations are based on
   previous site surveys, assessments, and mission analyses. Air Force installations are chosen
   for BSI by suitability.
   2.5.2. Resources provided by a designated BSI may include: marshalling and lay-down
   areas, security forces, personnel and equipment reception/staging areas and facilities,
   personnel support, billeting, transportation, material handling equipment, maintenance,
   general supply and subsistence support, contracting support, communications support, and
   medical services.
   2.5.3. Installation may be tasked as a BSI for incident relief efforts. The BSI serves as the
   main logistical hub for military support operations. Refer to IEMP 10-2, Annex B, Appendix
   3 for detailed information on BSI requirements and actions.

Table 2.8. AF Installations Selected as FEMA ISB Lessons Learned
Ensure approved DoD authorization is received at the installation before receiving
FEMA recovery assets.
Establish a FEMA Memorandum of Agreement with the regional FEMA office and
state emergency management agency prior to incidents for smooth coordination.
Establish FEMA incident management team installation access procedures.
Conduct a site survey to ensure a large staging area is identified to support hundreds
of incoming FEMA resources.
Identify installation access requirements for FEMA assets.
Determine staging area access control procedures and boundary barriers/fences.
Plan for excessive vehicle traffic; provide alternate installation access points for use.
Be aware of civilian transport personnel carrying privately owned weapons, and
develop a storage procedure for those weapons when the individuals are on the
installation.
Plan for fuel use for installation supporting equipment and aircraft fuel for transport
planes, helicopters, and possible Civil Air Patrol aircraft.
Develop a plan to feed, bed, and provide latrine access for individuals supporting the
recovery operation. Develop a plan for capturing feeding and lodging cost.
Ensure sufficient numbers of heavy equipment operators are available for each
apparatus assigned to the installation.
Ensure sufficient number of special transportation vehicle operators for each type of
vehicle assigned to the installation.
Plan sand bag filling and delivery processes. Deliver sand bags to areas needing
them vice having personnel come to the filling area. This drives the need for a
consolidated list of buildings that traditionally suffer water damage.
Develop a plan for capturing costs associated with ambulance runs to assist FEMA
workers.
2.6. Shelters. Circumstances may require installations to move some or all of the base populace
into shelters during a major accident or natural disaster. Potential shelters should be pre-
designated based on expected events. For example, installations in hurricane/typhoon prone
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                        19


areas should designate buildings that are built to withstand hurricane/typhoon force winds;
installations in flood prone areas should designate buildings that sit above the flood plain, etc.
   2.6.1. It is the BCE’s responsibility to identify and evaluate installation facilities that may be
   used for shelters. Installations should not rely on one shelter; several potential shelters
   should be identified. On-base agencies that provide a service to the population will normally
   be required to provide that service to shelter occupants. Force Support Squadron (FSS)
   through the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Emergency Support Function (ESF) - 6
   provides food and bedding; Civil Engineers (CE) through ESF 3 provides power, water,
   sanitary facilities and trash removal; medical will provide medical care; the owner/user of the
   shelter will provide security. Some of these requirements, e.g., food and bedding; may
   require staging in the shelter prior to the event. Others, e.g., water and power may be readily
   available through the normal infrastructure. If they are damaged, then bottled water and
   generator power may be needed. Sources for both should be located before the need arises.
   These shelter requirements should not be confused with shelter-in-place requirements, which
   are described later in this manual. The IEMP 10-2, Annex B, Appendix 4 outlines the
   necessary shelter-related steps to take in case of a major accident or natural disaster.
2.7. Evacuation. Evacuation is when personnel move from a hazardous area to a safe location.
The decision to evacuate from the incident area is made by the IC for incidents that require an IC
on the scene. The installation commander will make decisions to evacuate personnel from the
installation. Major factors in evacuation decisions are shelter availability, transportation to move
personnel, mission criticality of assets to be moved, and the safety of personnel evacuated.
AFMAN 10-2502 outlines the steps necessary to conduct evacuation planning within the IEMP
10-2. It is also important to ensure that local evacuation procedures for both major accidents and
natural disasters are briefed and disseminated through the Base Emergency Preparedness
Orientation (BEPO) as described in AFI 10-2501.
   2.7.1. For major accidents, an evacuation will most likely be an ICs decision based upon the
   information received at the incident site during initial incident site assessment. This decision
   will occur when it is too dangerous to have personnel shelter in place. An IC must have
   means to safely move, and a location to move personnel before evacuating.
   2.7.2. In most natural disasters, an installation commander has time to make operational risk
   management decision based on weather watches and warnings. Support Agreements, with
   installation participation in local community emergency planning committee meetings,
   assists the R & EM Flight in developing a well formulated evacuation plan for the IEMP 10-
   2, Annex B. The R & EM flight gains valuable planning information from the local
   emergency planning committee meetings. The information gained is essential to the IEMP
   10-2, Annex B development. The installation EOC ESFs can gather the information from the
   local or regional EOC to support evacuation decisions. Ensuring the base populace is
   prepared for an eventual evacuation is essential to the installation’s mission continuation.
   Evacuation briefing should include the route of evacuation, available shelters off base,
   supplies to bring, care of pets, and notification information. When the installation
   commander gives the evacuation order, the EOC must coordinate evacuation procedures with
   the local authorities.
 20                                                        AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


2.8. Education and Training. Education and Training is an integral part of the Air Force
Emergency Management Program. It provides the requisite knowledge and skills for effective
EM preparedness planning, operations, and recovery. Formal courses and on-the-job training
develop functional expertise in primary EM personnel. Some formal training courses also
provide emergency preparedness knowledge and skills for other personnel with EM program
responsibilities. Installation-level training helps develop knowledge and proficiencies DRF
members need to conduct emergency operations. It also provides the base populace with the
knowledge and skills needed to survive and operate during major accidents and natural disasters.
2.9. Exercises. A key factor to preparedness is ensuring the installation training and equipment
meet the needs of the DRF by conducting exercises. Exercises should be conducted to stress and
test every facet of major accident and natural disaster response according to AFI 10-2501.
However, exercises need not stress and test every facet simultaneously.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                        21


                                            Chapter 3

                                           RESPONSE

3.1. Response Overview. There are three phases of response for major accidents and natural
disasters: notification, response, and withdrawal or evacuation. The phases of response are
sequential and overlap each other. Notification is when the installation command control
element receives the notification of an accident or disaster. Once the notification is received,
response forces are dispatched to respond to the incident. Once responders arrive on scene, they
will assess the situation and if needed, they will initiate protective actions for personnel in the
affected area and for responders as outlined in AFMAN 10-2502. The response phase ends when
emergency actions have been implemented and lifesaving actions have been completed. This
section addresses notification, response, and withdrawal actions that should be considered during
major accidents and natural disasters. The first step is notification that an incident has occurred.
3.2. Notification. The goal of rapid, informative notification is to protect personnel, critical
equipment, weapons systems, and infrastructure. Notification provides time needed to disperse
equipment and weapons systems, curtail non-essential operations, and shelter or evacuate
personnel. Emergency response operations begin with notification. Reports of incidents come
from a variety of sources (i.e., telephone call; 911, crash phone, radio transmission, weather
forecast warning, watch or advisory, or eyewitness). Individuals witnessing an incident must
alert others in the immediate area and report it to the Emergency Communications Center (ECC),
Security Forces, Fire and Emergency Services, or the CP. Regardless of how notification is
received, an emergency response is initiated. During natural disaster events response personnel
will be unable to take action until immediate dangers subsides. Once response is initiated,
installation leadership, higher headquarters, and local civil authorities must be notified of events.
Notification procedures should be included in IEMP 10-2.
   3.2.1. Primary and Secondary Crash Nets. Installations use primary and secondary crash
   networks to notify first responders, emergency responders, airfield personnel, and other DRF
   elements. AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, provides direction
   for organizing and utilizing primary and secondary crash networks.
   3.2.2. Commander Notifications. The Command Post (CP) alerts the installation command
   structure, higher headquarters, and local civil authorities of incidents. If appropriate, the
   CAT will direct closure of runway(s) and issues a Notice to Airmen, advises taxiing and
   airborne aircraft of appropriate information, and instructs aircraft to divert or hold position as
   required. Additionally, the CAT implements the IEMP 10-2 and other plans depending on
   the situation.
   3.2.3. Disaster Response Force Recall. Units will use an emergency communications
   network (very high frequency or ultrahigh frequency radio network, touch to talk walkie-
   talkie capability, pagers, or cell phones) to notify fire, medical, security forces, and other
   response elements. The installation commander directs notification and activates the DRF in
   response to incidents through the CP.
   3.2.4. Installations provide weather notifications and updates, including watches, warnings,
   and advisories, via the INWS based upon information received from USAF weather
   organizations responsible for weather support to the installation.
 22                                                           AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


   3.2.5. The goal of quick, informative notification is to protect personnel, critical equipment,
   weapons systems, and infrastructure. Notification provides the time needed to disperse
   equipment and weapons systems, curtail non-essential operations, provide shelter, or
   evacuate when ordered.
   3.2.6. Determine civilian government agency notification requirements in advance.
   Notification must be made immediately to local government agencies when an emergency
   has the potential to affect public health and safety. Notify local civil authorities if an incident
   is off-installation or is a hazard to the civilian community. Also, notify affected local federal
   installations and facilities. Civil authorities are responsible for evacuation within their
   jurisdiction. In coordination with public affairs, enlist the help of local civil agencies and
   radio and television stations, if necessary. A list of special notification requirements and
   procedures should be annotated in the IEMP 10-2.
   3.2.7. Higher Headquarters. See AFI 10-206 for the Operational Report (OPREP)-3
   reporting requirements. AFI 10-206 is a quick reference guide to assist users in determining
   the type of report to submit. The level of report is based on whether or not an accident or
   incident could attract nation -level interest (PINNACLE) or only be of interest to
   Headquarters United States Air Force (USAF) (BEELINE).
3.3. Response Actions. Initial responders must apply the initial response principles shown in
Table 3.1. Successful application of these principles will yield protection of lives, property, and
the mission. The practical application of these principles includes a multitude of response
activities such as analyzing the incident, the planned response, and evaluating progress.

Table 3.1. Initial Response Governing Principles
 Respond and Establish Incident Command
 Lifesaving and Rescue
 Suppression and Containment
 Cordon
 Establish Tactical Priorities
 Determine and Communicate Protective Measures
   3.3.1. Initial Actions. This section describes the application of general principles governing
   initial response actions and includes elements of Emergency Responders Missions in more
   detail. Initial actions include responders defining the nature and scope of the incident.
       3.3.1.1. Establishing Incident Command. First responders arriving on-scene first will
       assume the role of IC, gain situational awareness, and establish the Incident Command
       System (ICS). The IC automatically assumes ownership of on-scene responsibilities until
       transferred to designated staff members. As the needs of the IC expand, the staff can be
       expanded. After initial assessment, the IC will advise the ECC of status. The IC can
       request support directly from units until the response is expanded and the EOC and
       additional Unit Control Centers (UCCs) are activated. If the EOC is activated, all
       requests for support and logistics will flow through the EOC rather than the ECC. The
       EOC will continue to develop and update the common operational picture (COP), while
       the IC develops an Incident Action Plan (IAP). Attachment 2 provides a generic model
       for initial incident site set-up by the IC and responding forces. Each scenario may require
       slightly different arrangements but the basic concept doesn’t change.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                   23


     3.3.1.2. Lifesaving and Rescue. Specific lifesaving and rescue activities will be directed
     by the IC. First responders will implement immediate lifesaving and rescue operations.
     They will conduct fire fighting operations and perform immediate medical care at
     established casualty collection points. Response plans should describe how the
     augmentation of resources would be provided to the IC.
     3.3.1.3. Suppression and Containment. Closely associated with other lifesaving
     activities is hazard suppression and containment. First responders suppress fires and
     similar incidents using a variety of strategies, including confinement, containment, and
     control.
     3.3.1.4. Establish Cordon. The IC determines the size of the incident cordon. As the
     situation matures and the type and scope of the problem is identified, the cordon is
     redefined based upon that information. AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, 12
     January 2011 and US Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
     Safety Administration Pamphlet PHH-50-ERG, Emergency Response Guidebook, lists
     initial cordon sizes for most HAZMAT. The EM Flight may advise on evacuation and
     cordon size based upon type and size.
        3.3.1.4.1. Security Forces execute operational and tactical security procedures to
        ensure the safety and security of emergency response forces and populations at risk.
        Security Forces provide initial site and incident cordon security functions. In
        addition, they respond to natural disasters on the installation, establish locations for
        protection of classified materials, identify and secure traffic control points, direct
        identification of personnel entering the incident site, coordinate with local law
        enforcement agencies, and advise the IC on security forces issues during the
        establishment of a NDA at CONUS locations.
            3.3.1.4.1.1. Control Site Access. Isolating the scene of the incident takes place
            when the emergency is discovered. If possible, the first on scene should secure
            the scene and control access, but no one should be placed in physical danger to
            perform these functions.
            3.3.1.4.1.2. Only trained personnel perform advanced security measures. Access
            to the incident scene must be limited to persons directly involved in the response.
            An entry control point (ECP) must be established with along with Control Zones.
            Access through the ECP will only be allowed with permission of the IC or
            designated representative.
            3.3.1.4.1.3. Entry Control Point (ECP). The ECP is where ingress and egress of
            all responders from an incident cordon takes place and is controlled by Security
            Forces or other government agencies. During an incident, the ECP is established
            upwind or crosswind of the incident site and at the established evacuation
            distance. The initial ECP location can change as new information is gathered
            during site assessment. During natural disasters the ECP will, in most cases, be
            located for ease of resource entry to the incident area or region.
        3.3.1.4.2. National Defense Area. As described in AFI 31-101, NDAs are
        established in the CONUS and US territories when necessary to secure government
        property in an emergency located off installation lands not under the jurisdiction or
24                                                   AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


     administration of, or in the custody of, DoD or a military department of the DoD.
     Establishment of a NDA temporarily places these non-federal lands under effective
     control of the DoD during emergencies. There must be close coordination with the
     commander, Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and local authorities. The senior DOD
     representative at the scene will define the boundary, mark it with a physical barrier,
     and post warning signs. To ensure the NDA is enforceable; i.e., allowing successful
     prosecution of NDA trespassing violations, Title 5, U.S. Code Section 551 et seq,
     requires public notice. As soon as practical after NDA establishment, announcement
     of the NDA should be published in the Federal Register (FR). Grid coordinates,
     expected duration, any special instructions regarding the NDA should be published in
     the FR. Additionally, local public affairs offices should ensure this same information
     is included in local media.
        3.3.1.4.2.1. Brief all personnel on the rules for use of force and apprehension and
        detention legalities. Military personnel are precluded from assisting civilian law
        enforcement pursuing or apprehending individuals outside the NDA. Request
        support from local civil authorities/officials in preventing unauthorized entry and
        in removing unauthorized personnel who enter the NDA. Ask civilian authorities
        to apprehend or arrest civilians who violate any security requirements at the
        NDA. Note: If local civil authorities are unavailable, or refuse to give assistance,
        on-scene military personnel should detain violators or trespassers. Disposition
        should be completed quickly following coordination with the legal officer.
        3.3.1.4.2.2. Military commanders retain no specific rights or jurisdictional control
        of an incident in a civilian-controlled area unless a NDA is tablishe. A transfer of
        authority must be provided to relinquish both operational and tactical control of
        the incident from civil authorities to the DoD component, installation EOC, and
        the IC. The civil authorities will be debriefed and will forward all financial
        expenditures, after action reports, and lessons learned to the installation incident
        investigations board.
     3.3.1.4.3. Hot, Warm, and Cold Zones. The IC must establish control of the site to
     protect first responders and restrict unauthorized personnel access. Response strategy
     is to establish three distinct zones where contamination is suspected: the exclusion
     zone (Hot Zone), the contamination reduction zone (Warm Zone), and the support
     zone (Cold Zone). See Attachment 2 for information on a typical incident site setup.
     Attachment 2 depicts a incident site for a hazardous material incident. The following
     paragraphs describe hot, warm, and cold zones.
        3.3.1.4.3.1. Hot Zone. The hot zone is defined as an area immediately
        surrounding a HAZMAT incident, extending far enough to prevent adverse
        effects from HAZMAT releases to personnel outside the zone. The hot zone is the
        area where the actual incident occurred and contamination may exist. Individuals
        entering the hot zone must wear the prescribed levels of PPE and be
        decontaminated before leaving. Entry and exit check points will be established at
        the outer boundary of the hot zone to regulate ingress from the Warm Zone and
        egress of personnel and equipment into the Warm Zone. The outer boundary of
        the hot zone is initially established by visually surveying the immediate area and
        determining if and where hazardous materials are located.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                   25


              3.3.1.4.3.2. Warm Zone. This area is defined as the area where personnel and
              equipment decontamination and hot zone support take place. It includes access
              control points through which personnel and equipment ingress from the Cold
              Zone and egress from the Hot Zone, if required. The warm zone is the
              transitional area between hot and cold zones. Since this zone is less hazardous,
              personnel can wear lower levels of PPE. The outer boundary of the warm zone is
              initially established by visually surveying the immediate area and determining if
              and where hazardous materials are located.
              3.3.1.4.3.3. Cold Zone. The cold zone is the outermost part of the site containing
              the Hot and Warm Zones and is considered non-contaminated. This is where the
              incident command post (ICP) and support equipment are located. Normal work
              clothes are acceptable in this area. The ICP should be situated upwind and
              upstream of the hot zone and should be easily accessible from highways or other
              transportation routes.
          3.3.1.4.4. The size and distances between the hot zone, warm zone, cold zone and the
          ICP is based on incident-specific conditions, the materials involved, and the IC’s
          judgment. The criteria in Table 3.2, should be considered when establishing zone
          boundaries.

Table 3.2. Zone Boundary Criteria
Site physical and topographical features.
Weather conditions and wind direction.
Air contaminants field measurements.
Hazard/chemical air dispersion models.
Physical, chemical, toxicological, and other hazard characteristics present.
Cleanup activities.
Presence of adequate roads, power sources, water, and the potential for fire or
explosion.
      3.3.1.5. Establish Tactical Priorities. The IC takes actions to implement strategic
      objectives developed in previous steps. Tactical priorities address the following: rescue,
      responder life safety, incident stabilization, and property/ environmental conservation.
      3.3.1.6. Determine and Communicate Protective Measures. The IC in conjunction with
      the EOC determines initial protective measures for personnel within the affected areas.
      The IC decides whether to evacuate personnel from the hazard area or to shelter-in-place
      within the cordon. Possible protective measures may also include the type and level of
      PPE, and type and location of contamination sensors. Evacuation or in-place sheltering
      augments PPE and protects personnel from hazards. If personnel evacuations are likely,
      temporary assembly areas must be identified and clearly marked.
      3.3.1.7. Responder Protection. Emergency responders face serious hazards during the
      execution of their tasks. Protection can be afforded using various forms of personal
      protective technologies such as protective garments, respiratory protection,
      environmental monitoring equipment, communications equipment, and practices and
      protocols. Limitations in existing protective technologies as well as the continually
 26                                                         AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


       expanding roles of emergency responders, drives the need to improve understanding of
       the risks responders face and the protection needed.
           3.3.1.7.1. Determining Responder Protection. Criteria for determining appropriate
           levels of responder protection include; performance of turnout gear (i.e., protective
           clothing); heat stress and exhaustion while working in turnout gear; necessity of
           respiratory protection; type of intra-responder communications needed; protection
           from explosive fragmentation and blast hazards; , and potential need for protection
           from chemical and biological hazards. Responder protection should be considered for
           all DRF members.
       3.3.1.8. Public Protection. Lines of authority and communication must be established
       and routinely tested to ensure functionality. All AF personnel should be trained to notify
       the chain of command or proper authorities of a suspected incident. Typically,
       installations use an emergency network to notify fire, medical, and security forces
       response functions. Installation notification and warning system is described in AFI 10-
       2501. Public protection measures include notification, sheltering, and evacuation. The
       set of protective actions available to the IC to protect the responders and the population
       are: (1) withdrawal, (2) evacuation, (3) sheltering-in-place, or a combination of the three,
       each defined below
   3.3.2. Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) Response. Within the US, its territories
   and possessions, the DHS coordinates response activities for federal agencies if the incident
   affects areas outside the installation boundaries. OCONUS, the DOS and COCOM will
   coordinate response activities. The initial response base coordinates directly with local
   officials until FEMA officials arrive. The applicable references are the NRF, NIMS, AFI 10-
   801, Defense Support of Civilian Authorities, and AFI 10-2501. When the effects of an
   incident on the installation extend to surrounding civilian communities, installation
   commanders provide DSCA under “imminently serious conditions”. In addition, a civilian
   community can request assistance for an incident that occurs off base under imminently
   serious conditions that include the need to save lives, prevent human suffering, and mitigate
   great property damage. The installation providing DSCA will report the incident to their
   MAJCOM as soon as possible when time does not allow the commander or installation to
   obtain prior approval from higher headquarters and when a civil authority requests
   assistance. Civil authorities’ requests must be in writing and must contain the scope and
   nature of the request. If a verbal request is given that requires an immediate response, the
   civil authorities must submit the request in writing as soon as possible. Applicable
   references are AFI 10-2501, AFI 10-801, the IEMP 10-2, the NRF, and NIMS.
3.4. Withdrawal or Evacuation. Withdrawal is a protective action used when responders are
in imminent danger or when all response actions have been completed. Withdrawal may be
immediate or planned. Persons who are in immediate danger of downwind hazards must be
evacuated immediately. Move victims away from the scene and away from responders.
Evacuation is a protective action to remove all personnel (military or civilian) from a threatened
area to a safer location. It is typically regarded as the controlled relocation of people from an
area of known danger or unacceptable risk to a safer area or to one in which the risk is
considered acceptable.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                     27


   3.4.1. Shelter-In-Place. Shelter-in-place is a protective action used during a major accident
   or natural disaster emergency condition to provide limited protection for otherwise un-
   protected personnel or casualties. Use in-place protection when evacuation may cause
   greater risk than remaining in place.
   3.4.2. Decision Trees. Decision trees are useful decision support aids to implement specific
   major accident or natural disaster action goals. Each decision tree is supported by data from
   determining toxic corridor and downwind hazards. Prominent incident action goals include:
       3.4.2.1. Minimize total population exposure, number of people exposed, and expected
       population risk. Avoid or minimize fatalities.
       3.4.2.2. Reduce exposure below a threshold level (i.e., no deaths exposure) and reduce
       exposure to as low as reasonably achievable.
       3.4.2.3. Goal Specific Decision Trees. The choice of goals is essentially an IC decision
       involving difficult tradeoffs. For example, the IC must decide whether it is better to: (1)
       minimize fatalities by having a large percentage of the population exposed to a sub-lethal
       but harmful level of chemical, or (2) minimize the number of people exposed by
       choosing to avoid exposure for most people, while allowing a few to be exposed to a
       potentially fatal level of the chemical. Refer to Attachment 3, Protective Actions to
       Minimize Exposure and Attachment 4, Protective Actions to Avoid Fatalities.
3.5. Command and Control (C2). C2 during major accidents or natural disasters starts at the
incident command level and migrates to one of the installation operation centers as the situation
matures. Dissemination of critical information is accomplished by a single integrated command
structure within the DRF. Each C2 level is assigned responsibilities to ensure overall success of
unit and installation mission priorities and management of emergency response and recovery
operations. Each level also performs organization and installation support functions to enable
safe management of incidents that threaten the primary mission of the installation. Actions are
prompted from standard operating instructions, checklists and other written procedures.
   3.5.1. Communications Principles. Installations must ensure effective communications
   systems exist to support incident management activities. Installations will comply with
   national interoperable communications standards. Such standards appropriate for the NIMS
   community are designated by the NIMS Integration Center.            Air Force incident
   communications follow standards called for under the AFIMS.
       3.5.1.1. An incident command manages communications at an incident using a common
       communications plan and an incident-based communications center established solely for
       use by the command, tactical, and support resources assigned to the incident. All entities
       involved in managing the incident should communicate using common terminology.
       3.5.1.2. Effective communications, information management, and information and
       intelligence sharing are critical aspects of domestic incident management. Establishing
       and maintaining a COP and ensuring accessibility and interoperability are principal goals
       of communications and information management. A COP and systems interoperability
       provides the framework necessary to:
           3.5.1.2.1. Formulate and disseminate indications and warnings.
28                                                         AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


         3.5.1.2.2. Formulate, execute, and communicate operational decisions at an incident
         site as well as between incident management entities across jurisdictions and
         functional agencies.
         3.5.1.2.3. Prepare for potential requirements and requests supporting incident
         management activities.
         3.5.1.2.4. Develop and maintain overall awareness and understanding of an incident
         within and across jurisdictions.
  3.5.2. Incident Commander (IC). The IC is responsible for all incident activities, including
  the development of strategies and tactics and the ordering and releasing of resources. The IC
  has overall authority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is responsible
  for the management of all incident operations at the incident site. The IC must be fully
  qualified to manage the response. The IC recommends EOC activation based on the need for
  additional resources at the incident site. The IC is equivalent to the on-scene IC as defined in
  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.120(8), Hazardous Waste
  Operations and Emergency Response.
  3.5.3. Incident Command Post. The ICP is the field location where the primary tactical
  level, on-scene incident command functions are performed. It is where the IC develops
  objectives, communicates with subordinates, and coordinates activities between various
  agencies and organizations.
  3.5.4. Disaster Response Force. The DRF includes the CP, CAT, EOC, ECC, IC, First
  Responders, Emergency Responders, UCCs, and specialized teams. DRF responsibilities are
  outlined in AFI 10-2501, including C2, contamination control, and shelter management.
     3.5.4.1. Senior Military Representative. The installation commander can dispatch to, or
     the incident commander can request a senior military representative (SMR) at the
     incident site. The SMRs’ primary purpose is to liaison with media and outside agencies
     during high visibility incidents or to support the incident commander. A SMR is not
     required at a vast majority of incidents. On scene, unless a transfer of Incident Command
     authority occurs, the existing IC maintains tactical control.
     3.5.4.2. Crisis Action Team. The CAT directs strategic actions supporting the
     installation's mission via the CP. The CAT’s primary focus during and after emergencies
     is mission continuation. Upon recommendation of the IC, the CAT directs activation of
     the EOC and recall of DRF elements/members when necessary. The CAT, through the
     CP sends and receives information and requests pertinent to emergencies.
         3.5.4.2.1. The CAT oversees operation of the CP, EOC and some UCCs dedicated to
         the strategic decision actions (e.g. Maintenance Operations Center). The installation
         commander serves as the senior leader of the CAT. The CAT is an organization
         capable of devoting full-time attention to a crisis and is composed of pre-designated
         personnel, with possible representation from outside agencies as needed. The CAT is
         scalable and tailorable at the discretion of the commander based on the situation. It is
         intended to provide intense management of "limited" crises and works collaboratively
         with the EOC. Additional staff members or senior officers representing major tenant
         units or host-nation forces may also be present to support CAT operations. The
         CAT’s primary functions are listed in Table 3.3.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                        29


          3.5.4.2.2. The CP is the essential C2 node of the CAT. The CP provides
          communications with higher headquarters and civilian agencies, and is the focal point
          for installation-wide warning and notification operations. It is responsible for
          submitting request for forces (RFF) process outlined in AFMAN 10-2502.

Table 3.3. Crisis Action Team Primary Functions
     Maintain the primary operational and support mission capabilities of the installation
     within the parameters of the incident.
     Provide support to the CAT and EOC Director during EM operations.
     Receive advice from the SJA regarding NDAs at off-base incidents.
     Oversee CP, EOC, and UCCs.
     Disseminate and collect information from the EOC.
     Coordinate RFFs through the appropriate MAJCOM.
     Coordinate required requests for external specialized teams such as State National
     Guard Civil Support Teams (CST), Hammer Adaptive Communications Element
     (ACE), Nuclear Emergency Search Team (NEST), Army’s Technical Escort Unit
     (TEU), and Air Force Radiation Assessment Team (AFRAT) required for response
     through their respective MAJCOM or component commander.
     Receive and disseminate orders and missions to ensure continuity of operational
     requirements.
      3.5.4.3. Emergency Operations Center. The installation commander activates the EOC
      and designates the EOC Director to manage incident response resources. The installation
      commander provides guidance to the EOC Director on mission priorities. The
      installation commander approves, directs, and ensures IC or EOC requests for assistance
      from external specialized teams are forwarded through MAJCOM or DoD component
      commanders. During a major accident or natural disaster the EOC Director must
      consider initial response actions listed below:
          3.5.4.3.1. Convene the EOC. Based on the magnitude of the incident, the EOC
          Director decides to recall the full EOC or to tailor the recall to include only those staff
          members and ESFs required to handle the incident. When there is doubt, it is easier
          to recall the full EOC staff and subsequently dismiss those members not required.
          3.5.4.3.2. Establish Situational Awareness. The EOC Director must establish and
          maintain situational awareness. As the EOC staff convenes, it is the EOC Director’s
          responsibility to ensure the entire staff is populating current incident information
          through the installation’s COP.
          3.5.4.3.3. Coordination of Information and Resources Supporting an Incident. Once
          the EOC is operational, the EOC Director ensures the EOC staff is responsive in
          coordinating information and resources the IC needs to facilitate effective response.
          3.5.4.3.4. Keeping the Installation Commander Informed. The EOC Director must
          keep the installation commander fully informed on the incident response efforts
          throughout the operation through the installation’s COP.
          3.5.4.3.5. Executing checklists. The EOC must effectively communicate information
          and decisions. Communications may include checklists to activate required
30                                                       AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


        resources, provide direction to evacuate or take cover, and accomplish specific
        emergency actions.
        3.5.4.3.6. Maintaining information flow. Information flows from the individual and
        continues via the UCC to the EOC. The EOC also communicates with MAJCOM,
        area of responsibility (AOR) or Host Nation, through the installation commander to
        report any critical issues or incidents affecting the mission. Additionally, information
        flows from the EOC to UCCs to inform of any changes in the threat.
        3.5.4.3.7. Ensuring the EOC staff develops messages, coordinates and consolidates
        communication inputs, and eliminates duplicate or contradictory information. During
        responses, the EOC receives reports from several sources. EOC processing of these
        reports includes organizing the reports; developing messages; and status updates
        relative to their source.
        3.5.4.3.8. Directing unit commanders to activate their UCCs and initiate unit
        personnel accountability. The EOC Director determines which UCCs remain
        activated.
        3.5.4.3.9. Determining specialized teams requirements. The IC can request any
        specialized team support needed for response operations. Upon request, the EOC will
        coordinate and activate the installation specialized teams. If the IC requires a
        specialized team not available locally, the request will go to the CAT. The CAT
        coordinates requests for external specialized teams using the RFF process through
        their respective MAJCOM. Examples of external specialized teams include: (1) State
        National Guard CST, (2) Hammer ACE, (3) US Marine Corps Chemical Biological
        Incident Response Force, (4) NEST, (5) Army’s TEU, and (6) AFRAT.
        3.5.4.3.10. Providing initial situation briefings. Upon initial recall, EOC personnel
        will report to the designated EOC and receive a situation briefing. The regarding the
        following topics should be considered for presentation: (1) description of the incident,
        (2) forces on-scene, (3), casualty estimate, (4), cordon size and location description,
        (5) protective measures being taken, and (6) tactical priorities, (7) weather
        considerations.
     3.5.4.4. Emergency Communication Center. During an emergency, the ECC receives
     and processes emergency calls and dispatches sufficient emergency response forces, (e.g.,
     fire emergency services, Security Forces, and Medical) to mitigate incidents as requested
     by the IC or the EOC once activated. The ECC supports the IC and emergency
     responders until the incident is completed. It also coordinates with CP, CAT, EOC, Base
     Defense Operations Center, and other UCC’s when necessary.
        3.5.4.4.1. The ECC supports the IC as the single dispatch point for initial emergency
        response. The ECC may dispatch other emergency responders until the EOC is
        activated.
        3.5.4.4.2. The ECC is the gathering point for initial emergency response information
        and populates the tactical level COP. Upon activation of the EOC, the ECC will
        share installation COP information with the ESFs 4, Fire Fighting; 5, Emergency
        Management; and 13, Public Safety and Security. The ECC will continue to manage
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                         31


          routine, non-emergency operations for security forces and fire emergency services
          and in many cases will act as a UCC.
      3.5.4.5. Unit Control Centers. UCCs provide support to the IC through the EOC (when
      activated) and to the installation commander as directed by the EOC. UCCs are the
      essential focal point within an organization during emergencies to maintain unit C2, relay
      information to and from unit personnel, provide expertise to the EOC or IC, and leverage
      unit resources to respond to and mitigate an incident. UCCs relay emergency information
      within the chain of command regarding major accidents and natural disasters. The UCCs
      also direct, monitor, report mitigation and preparedness activities, and maintain unit
      continuity for C2. UCCs are responsible for coordinating activities in preparation for,
      response to, and recovery from incidents. This includes gathering and disseminating
      information, accounting for personnel and resources, and performing initial damage
      assessment for their functional areas of responsibility.
          3.5.4.5.1. UCCs are responsible for coordinating activities for incident response with
          the respective EOC members identified in AFMAN 10-2502. UCCs are responsible
          for personnel accountability, emergency notification, accomplishing unit-level
          preparation, resource management, recovery actions and providing any support
          required by the EOC or IC. Effective accountability during major accidents and
          natural disasters is essential to maintaining safety and continuing search and rescue
          efforts. All responders report according to procedures established by the IC to
          receive mission assignments.
          3.5.4.5.2. To ensure efficient accountability of responders and personnel affected by
          the incident, tactical operations must be accomplished as outlined in the IAP.
          Additional UCC responsibilities are listed in Table 3.4.

Table 3.4. Unit Control Center Responsibilities
    UCCs support the IC, EOC Director, unit commander and the installation commander.
    UCCs serve as a communications conduit to unit personnel and provide a single point
    of contact at unit level for resources requested from the EOC/IC.
    UCCs maintain an activities log utilizing ICS Form 214, status of unit activities, and a
    base map identifying unit areas of responsibility, structures, and shelters.
    During major accidents and natural disasters, UCCs provide essential notification and
    dissemination of pertinent information to all personnel and support the execution of
    preparedness.
    UCCs conduct prevention and mitigation activities at unit level to support the IEMP
    10-2.
    UCCs provide personnel, resources, supplies, and technical expertise to the DRF
    structure to conduct EM operations.
      3.5.4.6. Local and State Government and Emergency Managers. Determine government
      agencies' notification requirements in advance. Notification must be made immediately
      to local government agencies when an emergency has the potential to affect public health
      and safety. Notify local civil authorities if the incident is off-installation or is a hazard to
      the civilian community. Also, notify affected local federal installations and facilities.
      Civil authorities are responsible for evacuation within their jurisdiction.

                                            Chapter 4

                                          RECOVERY

4.1. Recovery Overview. Recovering from a major accident or natural disaster often extends
past the incident itself. The recovery phase may require days, weeks, or even years before an
installation resumes normal operations. Responders develop a recovery plan for short-term and
long-term goals for restoration of functions, services, resources, facilities, programs, and
infrastructures. Responders analyze damage assessment reports and identify priorities to restore
the installation’s mission primary capabilities. During recovery, installations must also conduct
and maintain installation security, provide support and assistance to personnel (to include fatality
management and mortuary affairs), evaluate the incident, and identify lessons learned.
4.2. Recovery Operations. The recovery phase begins when emergency responders have
completed the emergency response and lifesaving actions. The EOC, using the IEMP 10-2 and
appropriate checklists, develops the installation recovery plan. The EOC Director, with approval
from the installation commander, activates a Recovery Working Group and identifies a Recovery
Operations Chief. The main goal of recovery is to re-establish installation mission and return to
normal operations. There may be critical missions that must continue before or during the
recovery phase. Installations must plan for those operations and develop procedures to remove
or minimize the hazards in an area or at a facility in order to continue the critical mission.
   4.2.1. Recovery Working Group (RWG). According to DoDI 6055.17, a RWG will be
   established early in the recovery phase. In most incidents, the RWG will be members of the
   EOC already activated and working response issues.
   4.2.1.1. The RWG will support ESF 14’s OPR and provide the EOC Director with an
   analysis of the damage, approximate number of personnel effected, short and long term
   shelter needs, resources that will be needed, and identify recovery funding availability.
           4.2.1.1.1. The RWG will provide an analysis of short term impacts to the installation
           and provide recommended priorities. They will also analyze long-term recovery
           impacts to housing, installation operations, base employment issues, infrastructure,
           along with environmental and health impacts. They will also provide information
           where installation personnel can receive local recovery assistance through ESF 15.
           4.2.1.1.2. The RWG should not duplicate on-going efforts within the CAT, EOC,
           federal/Non-Governmental Agencies or Host Nation. However, the RWG may
           determine the installation will require state or federal agency support. If needed, the
           RWG will advise the EOC Director and recommend CAT request external support.
           4.2.1.1.3. Working with the ESF 14 OPR and the Recovery Operation Chief (ROC),
           develop an installation recovery plan that has a logical way ahead and coincides with
           the local and state/Host Nation recovery plans ensuring installation needs,
           jurisdictional responsibilities, and financial means are met. The plan will identify:
               4.2.1.1.3.1. Health needs and fatality management.
               4.2.1.1.3.2. Quick fix projects relating to mission continuation.
               4.2.1.1.3.3. Critical facilities impacted by the incident.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                      33


             4.2.1.1.3.4. Hazard mitigation processes.
             4.2.1.1.3.5. Specialized team needs, if any.
             4.2.1.1.3.6. Short and long term shelter, food, water, and transportation needs.
             4.2.1.1.3.7. Short and long term resource needs (e.g. fuel, generators, heavy
             machinery, mobile lighting systems, traffic direction barriers)
             4.2.1.1.3.8. Weather predictions effecting recovery operations
             4.2.1.1.3.9. Long Term recovery options.
             4.2.1.1.3.10. Financial planning considerations.
  4.2.2. Recovery Operations Chief (ROC). Once the emergency response phase of the
  incident is completed and recovery operations begin, control of the incident site must be
  officially transferred from the IC to the ROC. The ROC is not referred to as an IC, but called
  the Recovery Operations Chief within the AF. The ROC must be a subject matter expert in
  the hazards or activities within the incident site. If it is a HAZMAT incident, the
  organization or individual that assumes control of the site must be knowledgeable of the
  hazards and recovery procedures. The person in charge of initiating actions to contain the
  hazard and clean up the site to restore the area to its condition before the incident should
  have an environmental engineering background and be familiar with HAZMAT clean-up
  requirements. If it is an aircraft incident, the ROC should be familiar with that aircraft or be
  a member of the interim aircraft mishap investigation team. The ROC:
     4.2.2.1. Is selected by the EOC Director and approved by the installation commander.
     4.2.2.2. Directs and coordinates recovery inspections and reports damage to the EOC
     Director by using “quick looks” and detailed assessments.
     4.2.2.3. Decisions should focus installation resources on safety, preventing the further
     loss of combat power, maintaining or restoring installation integrity and security,
     restoring C2 over forces, restoring the primary mission, and supporting other forces.
     4.2.2.4. Determines capabilities required to restore the force, units, facilities, and
     equipment to near-normal operating conditions major accident or natural disaster. These
     measures include decontamination operations and effective supply and sustainment of all
     response assets.
     4.2.2.5. Reports actions necessary or in progress that must be included in the recovery
     plan. Actions must include: estimates of repair costs, and how repairs will be
     accomplished (in-house or contract); estimated date and time for completion of recovery
     efforts; confirmation of support teams required (e.g. Prime BEEF and RED HORSE
     teams; and an assessment of impacts to combat readiness on installation mobility forces.
  4.2.3. Reporting. The EOC has requirements to communicate simultaneously certain
  information and decisions. Communications may include checklists to activate resources
  needed and accomplishment of specific actions associated with mission continuation.
     4.2.3.1. AFI 10-2501 requires all EOC real world incident activations or events to be
     reported via email to AF/A7CXR using an ICS Form 213, General Message and through
     ACE-FD. The EOC Manager will provide the date, time frame (activated-deactivated),
34                                                         AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


     reason with a short summary and email it to their MAJCOM Emergency Management
     Functional Manager and courtesy copy afilexr.workflow@pentagon.af.mil and
     afcesa.cex3333@tyndall.af.mil.
     4.2.3.2. Information flow starts with individuals and continues upward to the UCC and
     finally to the EOC. The EOC must communicate with the MAJCOM through the
     installation commander to report critical shortages or incidents affecting the installation’s
     mission capability.
     4.2.3.3. Information flow from the EOC downward informs UCCs of the situation as it
     changes. This includes alert stages, natural disaster threats, or major accident
     information.
     4.2.3.4. The EOC staff must coordinate and consolidate inputs to eliminate duplication
     of information.
     4.2.3.5. The EOC receives reports from several sources during responses. Organized
     reports, messages, and status updates usually originate from base personnel or designated
     teams to include the CAT, ECC, UCCs, and first and emergency responders. The reports
     are funneled to UCCs and passed to the EOC.
  4.2.4. Document Report Information. The EOC Director and EOC ESFs will maintain the
  necessary maps and status boards to show the key operations status in their areas of
  responsibility. In addition, they will maintain a permanent log of actions. This log of actions
  provides continuity between shift changes and assists in the preparation of daily situation
  reports (SITREP). A well-maintained and thorough log of actions provides the alternate
  EOC with periodic updates to enable a rapid resumption of operations if the primary EOC is
  damaged or destroyed; therefore, the log must be regularly copied and given to the alternate
  EOC. Detailed documentation is also required for continuity during the event, and for
  identifying lessons learned, reviewing planning documents, and updating execution
  checklists after an event. The EOC or CAT assimilates airbase information and forwards
  essential elements to joint force, theater, and MAJCOM command centers. The process is
  reversed for downward information flow.
     4.2.4.1. Expense Accounting. The finance/administrative section is an essential part of
     the ICS. In addition to monitoring multiple sources of funds, the section chief tracks and
     reports to the IC the financial “burn rate” (the rate at which resources are being
     consumed) as the incident response progresses. This enables the IC to forecast the need
     for additional funds before operations are adversely affected. This is important if
     significant operational assets are contracted to the private sector. The section chief may
     also need to monitor cost expenditures to ensure statutory rules are met. Close
     coordination with the planning and logistics sections are also essential to ensure
     operational records are reconciled in a timely manner with financial documents. The
     Finance/Administrative section track incident response costs, procurements, time costs,
     compensation and claims. The finance/administrative section chief may organize the
     different incident response costs into specialized units.
     4.2.4.2. Activity Logs. Activity logs detail unit and resource activity. These logs
     provide the basic reference from which to extract information for after-action reporting.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                        35


       An activity log is initiated and maintained by each UCC, the EOC, CAT and the ECC.
       Completed logs are submitted for after-action reporting when directed.
           4.2.4.2.1. UCCs, EOC, CAT and other reporting activities can use ICS Form 214,
           Activity Log, computer generated or installation approved activity logs. Additional
           ICS      forms    can    be    downloaded        from    the     FEMA     website:
           http://training.fema.gov/EMIweb/IS/ICSResource/ICSResCntr_forms.htm.
       4.2.4.3. According to AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program, the primary
       method for submitting observations and AFAARs is via AF-Joint Lessons Learned
       Information System (AF-JLLIS). Organizations or individuals should use this method
       whenever possible to submit individual lessons or AFAARs to their appropriate lessons
       learned office (normally the A9L for that MAJCOM or Numbered Air Force, or direct to
       HAF/A9L where appropriate. After actions report summary template is available on the
       AF-JLLIS website. When submitted via AF-JLLIS, AFAARs go to AF/A9L who in turn
       forwards them to the appropriate Numbered Air Force or MAJCOM for action. The
       intent is for inputs to be validated at the appropriate level of the submitting organization’s
       chain of command—the lessons learned process is not intended to be used to bypass the
       chain of command when submitting lessons.
   4.2.4.4. Conduct Damage Assessments. Damage assessment may include aircraft and
   support equipment, munitions and other real property. When necessary based on
   circumstances a claims processing location may be required. Damage assessments are
   completed in two phases. The first phase is a rapid field assessment of the area affected. The
   second phase is a detailed damage assessment of facilities and infrastructure. This section
   will only discuss the rapid field assessment during recovery actions.
       4.2.4.4.1. Rapid Field Damage Assessment. A reliable rapid field damage assessment
       will increase the likelihood that recovery funds and other resources are properly
       prioritized and targeted. Damage assessment also provides policymakers with guidance
       for planning and implementing mitigation measures. The field-based assessment acts as
       ground-truth for larger more comprehensive assessments such as satellite-based
       assessments. The objective of rapid field damage assessments is to get a quick reliable
       overview of damage-related issues shown in Table 4.2.

Table 4.1. Rapid Field Damage Assessment Impact Issues
What facilities have been damaged?
Is there damage to the environment?
What is the damage to utilities and other supportive infrastructure?
Are there impacts to livelihood because of the damage?
What role, if any, did pre-incident mitigation measures play in reducing the impact of
the incident, and under what circumstances and to what extent did this occur?
   4.2.5. Mishap Response Plan. The Installation Safety Office and the EM Flight work
   together according to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, AFI 91-
   204, and AFI 10-2501 to implement the Mishap Response Plan. The Mishap Response Plan
   complements the IEMP 10-2 and provides guidance for rapid response to all flight, weapons,
   and ground mishaps occurring within the installation’s area of responsibility. It is
   implemented at the conclusion of emergency response operations on-site as recovery actions
 36                                                          AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


      take place. This plan ensures timely assembly of the interim safety board to preserve
      evidence, compile data, and protect “privileged” and “for official use only” information for
      the Air Force Safety Investigation and subsequent safety report.
   4.2.6. Maintaining site or installation security after a natural disaster may be very difficult,
   depending on the extent of damage to facilities and resources. Maintain Site Security.
   During the recovery phase following major accident or natural disaster, site security may be
   enforced by installation Security Forces (SFs) the owner-user of the resources affected by the
   incident or, in many cases, a combination of both. AFI 10-2501 identifies the roles and
   responsibilities of these agencies. AFI 31-101, identifies the policies and guidance in
   protecting installation resources. The IEMP 10-2 must identify any manpower and
   equipment shortfalls that would preclude installation personnel from adequately maintaining
   site security. Preparation before a natural disaster is the key to success. Those responsible
   for sit security and those responsible for developing the IEMP 10-2 and Integrated Defense
   Plan must work together to ensure mission success.
   4.2.7. Provide Assistance to Personnel. Providing assistance to military members, civilian
   employees, and their families is extremely important. Airmen will be better able to
   concentrate on mission recovery if they know their families’ needs (medical, housing, legal,
   counseling, food, and clothing) are being met. The primary method of providing assistance
   is to activate an Emergency Family Assistance Control Center (EFACC). The EFACC will
   serve as the focal point for family assistance services. IEMP 10-2, Tab C, Appendix 7,
   Annex A, Family Assistance Checklist, provides guidelines for EFACC operations. The
   EFACC should operate in conjunction with the installation’s EOC and appropriate ESFs.
4.3. Mission Continuation. The installation commander will use operational risk management
tools to decide which critical missions to continue.
4.4. DSCA in Recovery Operations. If a CAT receives a request for DSCA, then the
notification of higher headquarters is completed as activities permit. Reporting will be
accomplished in real time for all DSCA situations and will include OPREP-3, SITREP and
narrative statement, as directed in AFI 10-801 and AFI 10-206. Additionally, installation
commanders will notify the Air Force National Security Emergency Preparedness office of
immediate response requests according to DoDD 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities.
All requests for USAF resources must be validated by the lead federal agency first to be
reimbursed for DSCA operations. In addition, the requests must comply with the legal and
accounting requirements for loan, grant, or consumption of USAF resources for DSCA to ensure
reimbursement under the Stafford Act. Military responders, who are called off-base for a
response, must observe the jurisdictional rights of civilian authorities and private citizens.
4.5. Joint Task Force (JTF) Support. Per Joint Publication 3-0, Joint Operations, “A JTF is a
joint force that is constituted and so designated by the Secretary of Defense, a CCDR, a
subordinate unified command commander, or an existing command JTF (CJTF) to accomplish
missions with specific, limited objectives and which do not require overall centralized control of
logistics. However, there may be situations where a CJTF may require directive authority for
common support capabilities delegated by the CCDR. Joint Publication 3-33, Joint Task Force
Headquarters, identifies further support that may be required. The AF role in support will be
directed from the Combatant Commander through the Air Component of that geographic
combatant commander.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                        37


   4.5.1. CONUS installations will also find further support requirements in USNORTHCOM
   Contingency Plans (CONPLAN) located on the NORAD-USNORTHCOM SIPRNET Portal:
   CONPLAN 3500-08, CBRNE Consequence Management Operations; CONPLAN 3501-08,
   Defense Support of Civil Authorities; and CONPLAN 3505, USNORTHCOM Nuclear
   Incident Response Plan. When directed by the President of the United States or the Secretary
   of Defense, USNORTHCOM will respond quickly and effectively to the requests of civil
   authorities to save lives, prevent human suffering, and mitigate great property damage.
   These plans provide military support according to applicable DoD directives and policy in
   line with national strategic policy.
       4.5.1.1. Established USNORTHCOM Instruction 10-222, USNORTHCOM Force
       Protection (FP) Mission and Antiterrorism (AT) Program, 17 Feb 10.
           4.5.1.1.1. Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region (JFHQ-NCR).
           4.5.1.1.2. Joint Task Force North (JTF-N).
           4.5.1.1.3. Joint Task Force Civil Support (JTF-CS).
       4.5.1.2. JTF support requests will be handled through the Defense Coordinating Officer
       (DCO) assigned to the Joint Field Office (JFO). Possible support areas identified in the
       NRF for DoD that could include Air Force support are intelligence sharing, air
       operations, search and rescue and BSI.
           4.5.1.2.1. An installation requiring additional DoD support, including Air Force
           support, will use the RFF process as outlined in AFMAN 10-2502. Installations will
           not arbitrarily send supporting forces unless the assisting installation falls within the
           authoritative jurisdiction for an Immediate Response. Lessons learned from 11
           September 2001 and the Gulf of Mexico 2005 hurricane season enforced the need for
           all DSCA, civilian requests for assistance, and federal RFFs to be handled at the JTF,
           Defense Coordinating Officer, and Joint Field Office levels.
4.6. Restoration. Restoration of Lifelines is the capability to initiate and sustain restoration
activities. Restoration of Lifelines addresses the immediate restoration of critical infrastructure.
This includes facilitating the repair/replacement of infrastructure for oil, gas, electric,
telecommunications, drinking water, wastewater, and transportation services. The restoration, in
concert with mission continuation tasks, officially begins when the IC advises the EOC Director
that the incident has been sufficiently controlled or terminated and the security of the situation is
sufficient to begin restoration activity. Consequently, the EOC directs and coordinates recovery
inspections and reports damage by using “quick looks” and detailed assessments.
   4.6.1. Restoration decisions should focus installation resources on safety, preventing the
   further loss of combat power, maintaining or restoring installation integrity and security,
   restoring C2 over forces, restoring the primary mission, and supporting other forces.
   4.6.2. Restoration capabilities include measures required to restore the force, units, facilities,
   and equipment to near-normal operating conditions after a major accident or natural disaster.
   These measures include decontamination operations, and the effective supply and
   sustainment of all response assets.
   4.6.3. All restoration actions, in progress or intended, must be recorded and, be part of the
   recovery plan. From this record, several actions are enabled. Those actions include
38                                                           AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


     estimating repair costs and determining whether the repairs will be accomplished in-house or
     by contract; estimating recovery date and time; ascertaining assistance required (for example,
     Prime Base Engineer Emergency Forces (BEEF) and Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy
     Operational Repair Squadron Engineer (RED HORSE)squadrons; and assessing the impact
     on the combat readiness status of installation mobility forces.
AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013                                                                            39


                                              Chapter 5

                                           MITIGATION

5.1. Mitigation Overview. Mitigation includes activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks
to persons or property or to lessen the actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident.
Mitigation measures may be implemented prior to, during or after an incident. Mitigation
measures are often developed according to lessons learned from prior incidents. These actions
include: documenting information; accounting of expenses; tracking of events; after-action
reporting; analyzing damage; implementing the recovery plan; documenting contamination;
accounting for classified and hazardous materials; maintaining installation or site security;
assisting personnel; providing response personnel stress debriefing; providing legal assistance for
claims, witnesses, and victims; base populace actions; and issuing notifications and
communications.
5.2. Preparing and Exercising Plans. Mitigation includes preparing and exercising critical
elements of responses to major accidents and natural disasters. Exercises must include realistic
scenarios to ensure installations are prepared for real-world responses. Exercises allow
installations to develop procedures for personnel notification, recall and accountability, as well
as resource protection and injury or damage reporting. Plans, such as the IEMP 10-2 and
applicable checklists are validated through preparation and execution of exercises.
5.3. Protection of Critical Facilities. An installation-specific critical facility is any facility that
is of such extraordinary mission importance that if damaged or destroyed would have serious
debilitating effects on the ability of the installation to function as opposed to only facilities that
are identified as critical infrastructure on the CI program list. Critical facility protection is
focused on assessing the risks, reducing the loss, and ensuring the survival of identified critical
facilities. Effective protection of critical facilities on an installation starts with the identification
of those critical facilities. Identification of critical facilities is completed using the using the risk
management process that is approved by the installation commander. Critical facilities
protection criteria are identified in Table 5.1
    5.3.1. Once critical facilities are identified, protective actions will be undertaken to
    remediate or mitigate the mission impact resulting from a major accident or natural disaster.
    Protective actions are threat-specific and could include: changes in TTPs, adding
    redundancy, selection of another facility, isolation, hardening, and guarding.
    5.3.2. Threat-specific physical protection is provided through passive defense and hardening
    mitigation. Permanent and expedient hardening methods increase physical protection for
    personnel, critical facilities, and infrastructure. The combination of physical protection
    measures and threat-specific TTPs enables commanders to minimize mission degradation and
    provide the most effective response and recovery following a major accident or natural
    disaster incident.
    5.3.3. Effective protection of critical facilities on an installation starts with the identification
    of those critical facilities. Identification of critical facilities is completed using the risk
    management process that is approved by the installation commander. Critical facilities
    protection criteria are identified in Table 5.1
 40                                                         AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


Table 5.1. Critical Facilities Protection Criteria
       What missions are supported by the installation/wing/unit?
       Which of these missions are considered critical?
       Are there home station or deployed missions?
       Have both primary and secondary missions and taskings been considered?
       What are the installation’s strengths, capabilities, and shortfalls? Make separate
       lists and carefully note the limitations and shortfalls.
       What supporting forces or outside agencies are available and what resources do
       they have?
       Are support agreements in place outlining responsibilities between agencies?
       How long before supporting forces or outside agencies can be on-scene?
       What are the most probable incidents and their worst possible impact?
       What are the installation’s priorities for protecting its resources?
       What resources are protected, where are they, and who controls them?
       What resources require additional levels of protection?
       Have personnel, critical facilities (communications/transportation nodes), and
       asset vulnerabilities (munitions, fuels, etc.) been considered?

and incidents that installation agencies typically handle.
Major Disaster—The Stafford Act defines any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane,
tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic
eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm or drought) or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood or
explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes
damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major incident assistance under this act
to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments and incident relief
organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship or suffering caused thereby.
Mitigation—Activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen
the actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. Mitigation measures may be
implemented prior to, during or after an incident. Mitigation measures are often developed
according to lessons learned from prior incidents. Mitigation involves ongoing actions to reduce
 52                                                         AFMAN10-2504 13 MARCH 2013


exposure to, probability of, or potential loss from hazards. Measures may include zoning and

Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA)—Written agreement between agencies, organizations or
jurisdictions that they will assist one another on request by furnishing personnel, equipment or
expertise in a specified manner. Reciprocal assistance by local government and an installation
for emergency services under a prearranged plan. Mutual aid is synonymous with "mutual
assistance", "outside aid", "memorandums of understanding", “memorandums of agreement”,
"letters of agreement", "cooperative assistant agreement", "intergovernmental compacts", or
other similar agreements, written or verbal, that constitute an agreed reciprocal assistance plan
for emergency services for sharing purposes. MAAs between entities are an effective means to
obtain resources and should be developed whenever possible. MAAs should be in writing, be
reviewed by legal counsel and be signed by a responsible official.
National Defense Area (NDA)—An area established on non-Federal lands located within the
United States or its possessions or territories for the purpose of safeguarding classified defense
information or protecting DoD equipment or material. Establishment of a national defense area
temporarily places such non-Federal lands under the effective control of the DoD and results
only from an emergency event. The senior DoD representative at the scene will define the
boundary, mark it with a physical barrier and post warning signs. The landowner’s consent and
cooperation will be obtained whenever possible; however, military necessity will dictate the final
decision regarding location, shape and size of the national defense area.
National Incident Management System (NIMS)—A system mandated by HSPD-5 that
provides a consistent, nationwide approach for Federal, State, local and tribal governments; the
private sector; and nongovernmental organizations to work effectively and efficiently together to
prepare for, respond to and recover from domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size or
complexity. To provide for interoperability and compatibility among Federal, State, local and
tribal capabilities, the NIMS includes a core set of concepts, principles and terminology. HSPD-
5 identifies these as the ICS; multiagency coordination systems; training; identification and
management of resources (including systems for classifying types of resources); qualification
and certification; and the collection, tracking and reporting of incident information and incident
resources.

Within AFIMS, preparedness is operationally focused on establishing guidelines, protocols, and
standards for planning, training and exercises, personnel qualification and certification,
equipment certification, and publication management.
Prevention—Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring.
Prevention involves actions to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and
other information to a range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence
operations; heightened inspections; improved surveillance and security operations; investigations
to determine the full nature and source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance
and testing processes; immunizations, isolation or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law
enforcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting, interdicting or disrupting illegal activity
and apprehending potential perpetrators and bringing them to justice.

for impacted communities and the reconstitution of government operations and services through
individual, private-sector, nongovernmental and public assistance programs that: identify needs
and define resources; provide housing and promote restoration; address long-term care and
treatment of affected persons; implement additional measures for community restoration;
incorporate mitigation measures and techniques, as feasible; evaluate the incident to identify
lessons learned; and develop initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents.
Recovery Operations Chief—The Recovery Operations Chief must be a subject matter expert
in the hazards or activities within the incident site. If it is a HAZMAT incident, the organization
or individual that assumes control of the site must be knowledgeable of the hazards and recovery
procedures. The person in charge of that work should have an environmental engineering
background and be familiar with HAZMAT clean-up requirements. If it is an aircraft incident,
the recovery operations chief should be familiar with that aircraft or be a member of the interim
aircraft mishap investigation team. The EOC Director should select the individual that will be in
charge of the site
Recovery Working Group—A task-organized team of personnel established early in the
recovery phase for every emergency where, in the judgment of the Commander, recovery
operations require coordination. If applicable, the RWG coordinates with local and regional
authorities on the restoration of infrastructure. The working group is focused on the evaluation,
prioritization, and coordination of recovery requirements
Response—Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response
includes immediate actions to save lives, protect property and meet basic human needs.
Response also includes the execution of emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation
activities designed to limit the loss of life, personal injury, property damage and other
unfavorable outcomes. As indicated by the situation, response activities include: applying
intelligence and other information to lessen the effects or consequences of an incident; increased
security operations; continuing investigations into the nature and source of the threat; ongoing
public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation or
quarantine; and specific law enforcement operations aimed at preempting, interdicting or
disrupting illegal activity and apprehending actual perpetrators and bringing them to justice.
Response Task Force (RTF)—A DoD response force appropriately staffed, trained and
equipped to coordinate actions necessary to control and recover from a radiological incident.
The specific purpose of the RTF is to recover weapons and provide radiological incident
assistance. RTFs are not structured to respond to terrorist use of CBRNE or radiological dirty
bombs
Severe weather—Any weather phenomena that pose a hazard to life or property and necessitates
issuance of a special weather statement, weather watch, and/or weather warning to designated
installation agencies from an Air Force Weather unit (i.e., regionally responsible OWS or

Senior Military Representative— The installation commander can dispatch to, or the incident
commander can request a senior military representative (SMR) at the incident site. The SMRs’
primary purpose is to liaise with media and outside agencies during high visibility incidents or to
support the incident commander. A SMR is not required at a vast majority of incidents. On
scene, unless a transfer of Incident Command authority occurs, the existing IC maintains tactical
control.
Status—of-Forces Agreement (SOFA)—An agreement that defines the legal position of a
visiting military force deployed in the territory of a friendly state. Agreements delineating the
status of visiting military forces may be bilateral or multilateral. Provisions pertaining to the
status of visiting forces may be set forth in a separate agreement, or they may form a part of a
more comprehensive agreement. These provisions describe how the authorities of a visiting
force may control members of that force and the amenability of the force or its members to the
local law or to the authority of local officials. Also called SOFA. See also civil affairs
agreement.
Technical Decontamination—The physical or chemical process of deliberate decontamination
to achieve a thorough cleansing and removal of contaminants from personnel and equipment.

Weather Warning—a short-range, installation-specific weather product/notice alerting
designated agencies to the imminent or actual occurrence of weather conditions of such intensity
as to pose a hazard to life or property for which the agency must take immediate protective
actions. Weather Warnings are issued for a USAF installation by a regionally responsible USAF
OWS or the installation USAF Weather Flight. The National Weather Service (NWS) issues
weather warnings for the surrounding civilian populace outside of the installation.
Weather Watch—a medium-range, installation-specific weather product that provides advanced
notice to designated installation agencies of potential for weather conditions of such intensity as
to pose a hazard to life or property. The weather watch can be thought of as a "heads up", at
which time agencies should begin to consider implementing required protective actions should a
subsequent weather warning be issued. Weather Watches are issued for a USAF installation by a
USAF OWS or the installation USAF Weather Flight. The National Weather Service (NWS)
issues weather watches for the surrounding civilian populace outside of the installation.
