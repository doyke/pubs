1. General.
    1.1. Concept of Operations. The primary method of recalling personnel is the Pyramid
    Recall System (PRS). It is the responsibility of each organization and staff agency to
    develop and keep a current Pyramid Recall Roster (PRR) that will provide immediate recall
    of personnel.
    1.2. Each unit will update its PRR on a monthly basis. All units assigned to Eielson AFB
    will send updated electronic copies to their respective group commander’s office no later
    than the 5th of every month.
    1.3. All group PRRs will be updated as necessary, but at least monthly. All groups assigned
    to Eielson AFB who are directly notified by the Command Post, (CP) as listed in Attachment
    5 will send electronic copies to the CP by the 5th of every month or within five (5) duty days
    of any updates.

   1.4. Each unit will develop executable comm-out recall procedures. Recommendations:
   Personnel residing off the installation should provide to their supervisor a detailed map of the
   area in which they reside, using well known landmarks as a guide. Information on the map
   should include the members rank/name, house number, and telephone number (if applicable).
   Each should include instructions, with initial starting point at the main gate to the
   individual’s quarters.
   1.5. Individuals listed in Attachment 2, 4 and 5 who are directly notified or recalled by the
   CP are responsible for keeping the CP informed of their location and ensuring the CP has a
   current contact number. In the event they will not be available, they will immediately notify
   the CP of their alternate’s name, location, and contact number. Any individual having
   someone take their place is responsible for briefing their replacements on all duties
   performed.

        in the vicinity of _________; National Emergency Center has requested a full
        accounting of all personnel and their family members traveling in that Area of
        Concern. Complete a telephone recall (including military, civilian and contract
        personnel) and report any personnel in the Area of Concern. UCCs will: report
        accountability to Installation Personnel Readiness using strength reporting
        procedures; and monitor accountability through AFPAAS at: https://afpaas.af.mil.
        3.3.2.6. Foxtrot recall: Other ―______‖ Used at the discretion of commanders.
     3.3.3. The 354 FW/CC, will determine whether individuals TDY or on leave must be
     individually contacted. By default, those members will not be contacted unless otherwise
     directed. Members on leave or TDY will not be considered available for exercise
     purposes. During real world events members on leave or TDY may or may not be
     available, this will be at the discretion of the 354 FW/CC.
     3.3.4. National Emergency Accountability.
        3.3.4.1. In the event of a national emergency, the National Emergency Center or HQ
        PACAF may initiate a request for accountability in a specific Geographic Area of
        Interest (GAOI).
            3.3.4.1.1. In the event of this request the Command Post will receive a message
            directing a recall and implementation of the AF Personnel Assigned
            Accountability System (AFPAAS).
            3.3.4.1.2. The wing will implement the locally developed National Emergency
            Accountability Checklist (Attachment 11)
        3.3.4.2. As a minimum unit commanders/directors must first accomplish unit
        accountability to determine which of their personnel are affected by the event. Then,
        using the GAOI , identify affected personnel and have them:
            3.3.4.2.1. Log in to AFPAAS at: https://afpaas.af.mil/ and account for
            themselves and complete the needs assessment survey, or
            3.3.4.2.2. If assigned personnel do not have access to a computer the member
            will contact their UCC and the UCC will account for them and if requested,
            complete the needs assessment survey on behalf of the member in AFPAAS, or
            3.3.4.2.3. UCCs unable to access AFPAAS will provide accountability
            information to the Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) office (354
            FSS/FSOXI) for update.
            3.3.4.2.4. UCCs must use unit duty status program and tools (DTS, LeaveWeb,
            etc) to determine those that are TDY/Leave into the GAOI and manually add
            them to the event in AFPAAS to provide accountability.
            3.3.4.2.5. Personnel (to include family members, as reflected in DEERS) not
            assigned to, living in, or TDY/leave into the GAOI will not be accounted for in
            AFPAAS.

4. Pyramid Alerting System.
    4.1. When directed by the 354 FW/CC or designated alternate, the CP will initiate the
    required recall.
    4.2. General or selective recalls will proceed IAW the diagrams listed in Attachment 2 and
    3. In a ―Real World‖ general recall situation, it will be necessary to recall associate and
    attached units at Eielson. Recall for these units will be initiated by the ―Parent‖ agencies
    tasked in Attachment 4. Associate and attached units are responsible for providing their
    ―Parent‖ agency with current recall rosters.
    4.3. During any recall the CP will contact the 24 hour agencies as listed in Attachment 5.
    4.4. The Pyramid Alerting System may be used to pass time critical information such as
    natural disaster, cold weather operating procedures, FPCON, etc., to the base populace.
5. Audible Signals.
    5.1. When directed to do so the following devices are used by the CP or designated
    organization to pass on any necessary or time critical information to the base populace:
    Giant Voice system, Commander’s Access Channel, Installation Warning System (IWS),
    telephones, radios, speaker equipped vehicles, and sirens, etc.
    5.2. Giant Voice:     The Giant Voice system may be activated and recall instructions
    announced.
    5.3. PA Announcements:         The Commander’s Access Channel may broadcast recall
    instructions.
6. Personnel Accountability and Strength Reporting.
    6.1. Strength accounting and reporting gives the ICC vital information about the 354 FW
    readiness posture. These numbers dictate how the wing will react to any given tasking. This
    information should be safe guarded at the highest level necessary.
    6.2. Strength Accounting: Primary strength accounting and reporting rest with the unit.
    Each UCC is responsible for collecting the personnel strength figures of all associated units
    and providing the data to the ICC Admin. UCCs will report personnel status to the ICC
    Admin or in TBMCS IAW Attachment 7.
    6.3. Personnel strength reporting is implemented in conjunction with the RIT. All 354 FW
    and associate units must coordinate with their respective UCCs to obtain the RIT. Unit
    Control Centers are required to report personnel strength data at recall initiation time plus 30,
    60, 90, and 120 minutes. This information will be up-channeled to the ICC Admin Staff
    IAW instructions in Attachment 6. Accordingly, this data must arrive to ICC Admin NLT
    the prescribed cut off time(s) plus 15 minutes (i.e. RIT, 45, 75, 105, 135 minutes). The ICC
    Admin will provide the wing commander with a status update at RIT plus 90, 120, and 150
    minutes and a final report after all units are complete.
    6.4. UCCs will provide the ICC Admin Staff with the information defined in Attachment 7,
    using the prescribed secure reporting data system; Theater Battle Management
    Communications Systems (TMCS). Do not report numbers using the terms defined here,
354FWI10-401 19 NOVEMBER 2009                                                              9

                         STRENGTH REPORTING PROCEDURES

A6.1. Unit Control Centers will establish communications with the ICC Admin Staff
immediately upon activation. The preferred initial communications check with ICC Admin is
NIPR email from the units UCC organizational mail account. NIPR and SIPR organizational
mail accounts should be set up as follows:


NIPR: Eielson UCC_(unit)@eielson.af.mil
SIPR: Eielson UCC_(unit)@eielson.af.smil.mil
EXAMPLE: NIPR: ―Eielson UCC_354OSS@eielson.af.mil‖
EXAMPLE: SIPR: ―Eielson UCC_354OSS@eielson.af.smil.mil‖

A6.2. The ICC Admin Staff is the central point of contact for the UCCs to the Installation
Control Center. The ICC Admin Staff email accounts are:


NIPR: eielson.icc.admin@eielson.af.mil
SIPR:    eielson.icc.admin@eielson.af.smil.mil

A6.3. The Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) element of 354 FSS is charged with
maintaining accountability for all 354 FW personnel. The IPR e-mail account is:


NIPR: 354FSS.FSOXI@eielson.af.mil

A6.4. Personnel accountability and strength reporting will be accomplished via the following in
order of precedence:
     A6.4.1. Prescribed secure reporting data system, i.e., Theater Battle Management
     Communications Systems (TBMCS).
     A6.4.2. Digitally encrypted NIPR email to IPR using format IAW para 6.4.
