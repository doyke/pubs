This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-2, Intelligence Rules and
Procedures, and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 14-202, Volume 3, General Intelligence Rules. This
volume prescribes standard intelligence procedures for Air Force Special Operations Forces (AFSOF)
units with the exception of MQ-1 and EC-130J units. MQ-1 units will be governed by AFI 14-2MQ-1,
Volume 3, and AFI 11-2MQ/RQ-1, Volume 3. This instruction also includes Air Combat Command
(ACC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), and Air Reserve Component
(ARC) personnel recovery (PR) unit intelligence procedures. The Air National Guard (ANG) is
considered a MAJCOM for the purposes of this instruction.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. The on-line

1.1. General.
    1.1.1. Scope. This volume outlines the procedures applicable to AFSOF and Personnel Recovery
    intelligence operations. With the complementary references cited, this volume prescribes standard
    operational procedures to be used by all AFSOF and PR intelligence personnel. This AFI outlines
    minimum requirements for operational processes and may be supplemented by additional unit-level
    written guidance. Unit-level written guidance may expand these basic procedures, but in no case
    will they be less restrictive.
    1.1.2. Office of Primary Responsibility. AF/A2 delegates office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
    this instruction to AFSOC/A2. AFSOC/A2 will coordinate standard intelligence procedures for PR
    units with the appropriate MAJCOM/A2s.
    1.1.3. References. The primary references for AFSOF and PR intelligence operations are listed in
    Attachment 1 of this volume.
    1.1.4. Compliance. The senior intelligence officer (SIO) will ensure compliance with Air Force and
    MAJCOM directives and procedures as well as special notices in the Intelligence Read File (IRF).
1.2. Waivers. MAJCOM/A2 is the waiver authority for specific intelligence procedural requirements
outlined in this instruction. Units will submit waivers through MAJCOM/A2. MAJCOM/A2 will
courtesy copy AF/A2, AFSOC/A2 and ACC/A2 regarding all waiver requests and responses and other
applicable MAJCOMs as appropriate.
1.3. Supplements. AF/A2 delegates approval authority to the MAJCOM/A2 for MAJCOM authored
supplements to this AFI. MAJCOMS will ensure copies are provided to AF/A2 and all appropriate
MAJCOMs upon publication. Per AFPD 14-2, supplement will not be less restrictive than the lead AFI
and should be limited to unique requirements only.
1.4. Volume Changes. Send recommended changes to this publication on AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, through appropriate channels to MAJCOM/A2.
MAJCOM/A2 will forward recommended changes to AFSOC/A2 and courtesy-copy AF/A2 and
ACC/A2 as applicable.

   mission.
   2.2.2. When applicable, submit manpower status reports IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 3. Reports
   should cover all OG intelligence activities and personnel. SIOs are accountable for all information
   contained in their report. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units will send reports to their
   AFRC Numbered Air Force (NAF) for consolidation and forwarding to AFRC/A2. ANG units will
   send a copy of their readiness reports to NGB/A2.
   2.2.3. Actively solicit feedback from wing/group and subordinate commanders to improve
   intelligence support processes.
   2.2.4. Establish a visitation program to squadron intelligence work centers and solicit feedback from
   squadron intelligence and operations, where applicable.
   2.2.5. Monitor peacetime unit intelligence personnel schedules to ensure required intelligence
   support is available.
2.3. Written Guidance. The SIO will maintain written guidance in order to standardize performance
and provide continuity of peacetime and contingency operations procedures and responsibilities.
   2.3.1. Coordinate procedures with base-level agencies, as appropriate.            Procedures will be
   documented and approved at the wing/group level when necessary.
   2.3.2. Ensure all written guidance is reviewed annually and updated when procedures change.
   2.3.3. The SIO will ensure current written guidance is available for the following:
       2.3.3.1. General organization and responsibilities of the intelligence organization.
       2.3.3.2. Intelligence personnel training program.
       2.3.3.3. External intelligence training (EIT).

3.1. Introduction. Qualified external intelligence trainers (EITs) will conduct external intelligence
training. This training includes, threat knowledge, visual recognition (VR), collection and reporting
(C&R), personnel recovery (PR) and force protection (FP). External training will be coordinated with
the wing or group Weapons and Tactics Flight or Officer and security forces, as appropriate. The SIO
may determine if other unit personnel require external training and will modify training requirements as
appropriate.
3.2. External Intelligence Training. The SIO will:
    3.2.1. Establish an external intelligence training program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons
    system(s), projected wartime tasking and expected base/deployment location(s).

    execution. The EIT program manger may be the same person as the intelligence personnel training
    program manager (see AFI 14-2AFSOF/PR vol 1). Where assigned, the USAF Intelligence
    Weapons Instructor Course graduate will be directly involved in the external intelligence training
    program development and execution.
    3.2.3. Ensure only qualified external intelligence trainers (EITs) conduct unsupervised external
    intelligence training events. External intelligence trainer specialization training requirements and
    evaluation criteria are identified in AFI 14-2AFSOF/PR, Volumes 1 and 2.
    3.2.4. Ensure development of written guidance that identifies procedures for conducting,
    documenting, testing, evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. Coordinate EIT written guidance
    with all applicable commanders, detailing how the external intelligence training program will be
    conducted.
    3.2.5. Ensure coordination of EIT guidance and scheduling will be coordinated with any agency
    (e.g. Weapons and Tactics, SERE, ALS) that assists intelligence personnel in providing training.

The purpose of the Phase 1 Reintegration debriefing is to gather
intelligence from recovered isolated personnel (IP) to prevent combat
loss, facilitate hostage return, and mitigate/identify threats to coalition
forces. Physical health and medical care have priority over intelligence
exploitation. Ask amplifying questions relevant to the IP. Phase I intel
debriefers will be identified in advance to the theater JPRC – debriefs
will occur immediately upon return to friendly control at locations
identified by the JPRC and IAW theater standards.

evacuated through SIGINT channels
6.3. Documents (maps, manual , lists, letters, plans, etc) evacuated
