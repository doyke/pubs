                                           Chapter 1

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides Air Force policy and guidance for managing the Lt Col-
and-below aircrew force (pilots, navigators, combat systems officers [CSOs], weapon systems
officers [WSOs], electronic warfare officers [EWOs], air battle managers [ABMs], career
enlisted aviators [CEAs], flight surgeons, and X-prefixed personnel). It lays out the Air Force‘s
approach to Aircrew Management, assigns responsibilities, and details processes and
methodologies. (NOTE: Unless otherwise stated in this AFI, ‗Combat Systems Operator‘ or
‗CSO‘ include navigator, CSO, WSO, and EWO.)
1.2. Aircrew Member. AFPD 11-4 Aviation Service (paragraph 3.1), is the source document
for defining ―aircrew‖. Pilots, CSOs, ABMs, and Flight Surgeons are rated officer aircrew
members. Enlisted members holding AFSC 1AXXX are considered Career Enlisted Aviators.
Some officer and enlisted aircrew members (e.g., 46F Flight Nurse, 4N0X1 Aerospace Medical
Services Specialist, and 1N5X1 Airborne Intel Technician) are non-career aviators, and are
referred to as non-rated aviators in this AFI.
1.3. Aircrew Management. The objective of Aircrew Management is to meet near-term,
operational requirements while building leaders for tomorrow thereby ensuring a healthy aircrew
force (i.e., combat ready and sustainable) to effectively support current and future Air Force
missions. To ensure this strategic objective, Aircrew Managers have oversight responsibilities
for Lt Col-and-below aircrew requirements and shaping inventories to match these requirements.
Though there are myriad tactical responsibilities that contribute to effective Aircrew
Management (e.g., Current Ops scheduling; ARMS inputs), the strategic Aircrew Managers are
responsible for developing coherent and workable policies and executing sound practices at the
command level to provide for the overall health of the aircrew force today and in the future.
Strategic Aircrew Managers are Air Staff and MAJCOM level, to include NGB and AFPC. If an
issue or initiative deals with numbers/types of aircrews or aircraft, it has Aircrew Management
implications that require coordination with the Aircrew Management offices as described in this
instruction.
1.4. Who Must Comply. The policies and requirements of this instruction apply to all Air
Force organizations and personnel involved in managing the aircrew force. Unless otherwise
stated in this AFI, ‗Air Force‘ includes Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve. In addition to those
outlined in this chapter, other responsibilities are established throughout this AFI, not only for
the offices and organizations outlined below, but also for other SAF and HQ USAF offices as
well. Also, this AFI outlines AF Aircrew Management responsibilities as they relate to non-AF
organizations (e.g., Joint Staff and OSD) that have requirements for AF aircrew members.
1.5. Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF). CSAF oversees Aircrew Management, and
periodically convenes four-star-level aircrew summits to address aircrew issues.
1.6. Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans & Requirements (HQ USAF A3/5). HQ
USAF A3/5 is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for Aircrew Management. HQ USAF
A3/5 develops strategy, policy, guidance, plans and processes/methodologies for functionally
managing the aircrew force. For aircrew requirements/manning purposes, this office is
specifically responsible for the AF Flight Standards Agency, AF National Security Emergency
6                                                          AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


Preparedness Agency, Nuclear Weapons & Counterproliferation Agency, AF Operations Group,
and any other FOAs/DRUs/organizations aligned under HQ USAF A3/5.
    1.6.1. Directorate of Operations (HQ USAF/A3O). HQ USAF/A3O develops and
    oversees implementation of CSAF and HQ USAF A3/5 policy/guidance governing aircrew
    training, readiness, and aircrew requirements/manning via the Aircrew Management
    Approach and processes/procedures outlined in this AFI. Unless otherwise directed by
    CSAF or HQ USAF A3/5, HQ USAF/A3O is approval authority for aircrew
    absorption/production levels and distribution plans; rated allocation methodology and
    oversight; and any other areas that have significant Aircrew Management implications.
       1.6.1.1. Director of Air Operations (HQ USAF/A3O-A). HQ USAF/A3O-A is
       responsible for policy/oversight of air operations to include operational readiness,
       command & control, aircrew management, flying training, civil aviation, special ops &
       personnel recovery, classified programs, homeland defense, flight standards, airspace,
       ranges & airfield ops. CSAF-designated lead for tracking combat/contingency operations
       and exercises. Develops/assesses airpower employment and concepts.
          1.6.1.1.1. Operational Training Division (HQ USAF/A3O-AT). HQ USAF/A3O-
          AT is responsible for the day-to-day conduct of Air Force Aircrew Management
          matters as directed in this instruction, to include formulating policy/guidance and
          processes/methodologies for the following: operational flying unit readiness
          parameters (experience mix, average time on station, and manning levels); aircrew
          manpower requirements; undergraduate flying training (UFT) production guidance;
          absorption calculations; distribution plans; and graduate level flying training
          requirements. AF/A3O-AT, in coordination with AF/A1PP, develops and publishes
          rated allocation plans (including HAF, Joint Staff, and OSD) approved by CSAF and
          designed to meet near-term operational as well as long-term leader requirements. The
          division provides Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFMs) for all Pilots,
          Navigators/WSOs/EWOs/CSOs, ABMs, and CEAs (11XX, 12XX, 13BX, and
          1AXXX AFSCs, respectively) to perform the above functions, as well as the AFCFM
          duties outlined in AFIs 36-2201 Volumes 1 and 5. Additionally, the division has
          CFM responsibilities for the 1C0X2 Aviation Resource Management AFSC. The
          AFCFMs are responsible for documenting, tracking, analyzing, coordinating and
          recommending improvements. The division also houses Program Element Monitors
          (PEMs), who are the MAJCOMs‘ advocates for formal flying training requirements
          resources/funding and conduit into the AF corporate process. HQ USAF/A3O-AT
          oversees aircrew requirements as directed in this AFI (Chapter 6) and in AFI 38-201,
          to include producing official Air Force aircrew manpower requirements projections
          (redlines) and approving/maintaining AF Forms 480 (Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying
          Justification) for SAF, OSD, JCS, and any other positions that do not fall under
          MAJCOM purview, as well as for all P/N-prefix billets (ref AFMAN 36-2105). The
          division also evaluates new X-prefix, non-rated aircrew position requirements to
          validate ―full-time‖ in-flight duties specific to aircraft‘s primary mission in
          compliance with AFIs 11-401 and 11-402 and ensures aircrew qualification programs
          are in compliance with AFIs 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2 for all rated, CEA, and non-
          rated aircrew members.
              1.6.1.1.1.1. Aircrew Management Executive Council (AMEC). At least
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                7


          annually, HQ USAF/A3O-AT organizes and chairs a colonel/CEM-level AMEC
          conference whose attendees are Aircrew Managers from the operations and
          personnel communities across the Air Force. AMEC is a decision forum that
          assesses the health of the aircrew force by reviewing key aircrew force
          decisions/guidance and trends/issues/concerns, discussing improvement options,
          and developing proposals/taskers for further coordination/approval in the formal
          AF staffing process. The AMEC also provides a forum for ensuring Aircrew
          Managers have a sufficient and consistent understanding of Aircrew Management.
          Aircrew issues normally discussed include: readiness parameters (experience
          mix, average time on station, and manning levels); manpower requirements;
          absorption; training/production; distribution; retention; rated allocation;
          requirements-inventory delta management; and any other issues or developments
          that may affect the aircrew force. A list of AMEC members is at Attachment 4.
          1.6.1.1.1.2. AMEC Subgroups. AMEC Subgroups are established to collect
          information, work issues, and develop proposed positions for presentation to
          AMEC. The AMEC Subgroups and their Chairs are: Training Management –
          AETC/A3R; CAF – ACC/A3T; MAF – AMC/A3T; SOF – AFSOC/A3T; CEA –
          AF/A3O-AT; Ad Hoc – As designated by AMEC. Each AMEC, Subgroup Chairs
          will report on: State of Force; Subgroup Work done since last AMEC;
          Outstanding Taskers with Recommendations; Issues affecting force. Preparations
          for AMECs are the purview of the Subgroup Chairs, who have complete
          responsibility and autonomy over their respective Subgroups (e.g., meeting venue
          and attendees).
             1.6.1.1.1.2.1. AMEC Training Management Subgroup (ATMS). The
             Training Management Subgroup is a crosscutting Subgroup, that addresses
             training requirements and management issues that affect each of the other
             Subgroups. Training is the primary facilitator for making the aircrew
             management ―system‖ work. The focus of this subgroup is on training related
             issues that impact aircrew management. The subgroup is chaired by HQ
             AETC/A3R. The Core membership of the ATMS are those organizations that
             have training management responsibilities (HQ USAF/A3O-AT and A1PP;
             HQ AETC/A3R and A3F; HQ AFPC/DPA; lead MAJCOM/A3; AFSOC/A3;
             ANG/A3; and AFRC/A3 representatives). SAF/IAPX will participate as
             desired/required to represent international training issues. The ATMS does
             the following: facilitates the Aircrew Training and Distribution Requirements
             (ATDR) process (including the identification, validation, consolidation,
             programming and resourcing of requirements); reviews Distribution Plans,
             Undergraduate/Graduate           Program        Requirements       Documents
             (UPRDs/GPRDs), Planning Program Guidance Letter(s) (PPGL) and
             Programmed Flying Training (PFT) documents for consistency; identifies any
             projected over-/under-production, breaks in training, and other deviations that
             could adversely affect the Training and Force categories; provides visibility
             into the pipeline training flow and management with an eye toward improving
             effectiveness/efficiency. The ATMS, normally an ‗AO-level‘ group, is
             responsible for keeping the AMEC apprised of its activities and progress.

                   since the last AMD was published; AMEC briefings and background papers;
                   operational unit experience, average time on station (TOS), and actual
                   manning level data for the end of the fiscal year; requirements and inventory
                   actual data for the end of the fiscal year; Total and Major Weapon System
                   (MWS) requirements vs. inventory projections (Redline/Blueline charts);
                   retention statistics; UFT planned and actual data; distribution planned and
                   actual data; forecast allocation and actual data; and experience definitions,
                   criteria, and mix. The AMD will document the deliberations/decisions of
                   AMEC and any other forum germane to Aircrew Management (e.g., AF Ops
                   Conference; Realistic Training Review Board).

    MAJCOM needs and requirements statements. Two particular areas of HQ USAF/A5R work
    that have Aircrew Management implications are Capability Development Documents
    (CDDs) and Capability Production Documents (CPDs), which contain aircraft crew
    composition/ratio requirements and have impacts on a number of areas (e.g., formal training
    resources/funding/requirements, operational unit readiness/training/manning/funding), and
    aircraft modifications and associated schedules, which affect flying hour program execution,
    aircrew experiencing rates, and unit readiness/capability. Accordingly, these two areas
    require HQ USAF/A3O coordination. (A5R Divisions: A5RC – Combat Forces; A5RE – EW

           Team provides functional recommendations to HQ USAF/DPE (Chief‘s Group) on
           CMSgt assignments.
              1.7.4.1.1.1. Pipeline     and     Trainer       Assignments     Branch        (HQ
              AFPC/DPAOT). The AF OPR for assigning all Air Force Active Duty aircrew
              candidates and aircrews to formal survival and flying training schools/courses in
              accordance with AF Distribution Plans, Undergraduate/Graduate Program
              Requirements Documents (U/GPRDs), and Programmed Flying Training (PFT)
              documents. Consolidating training assignments under a single office facilitates
              implementation by efficiently and effectively aligning aircrews against planned
              numbers and types of survival/flying training quotas in compliance with the
              U/GPRD and PFT documents. PFT documents identify training requirements for
              a three-year period (execution year and two planning years) to help align training
              and budgeting processes, and to facilitate assignment-quota management. NOTE:
              For CEA‘s, HQ AETC/A3RF is responsible for ensuring completion of all
              prerequisite training (e.g., technical, survival). Once prerequisite training is
              completed, HQ AFPC/DPAOM4 provides assignment instructions and schedules
              follow-on weapons system training.

           actions culminating in an annual Developmental Education Designation Board
           (DEDB) chaired by AF/A1. Additionally, AFPC/DPAF incorporates policies and
           guidance from AF/A1, AF/A1DI and AFPC/DPA on the development and execution
           of SECAF/CSAF Force Development objectives to meet current and future Air Force
           mission needs.
1.8. Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Programs (HQ USAF/A8). HQ USAF/A8 provides
long-term planning and programming for the Air Force. Develops, integrates and analyzes the
Air Force Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) and Long Range Plan to support the national
military strategy. Formulates and evaluates options relating to readiness, sustainability, force
structure and modernization for SECAF/CSAF. It is also responsible for all Program Change
Requests (PCR), IAW AFI 16-501, Control and Documentation of Air Force Programs.
Additionally, AF/A8 facilitates the Air Force Corporate Structure (Integrated Product Teams,
Mission and Mission Support Panels, Air Force Group, Air Force Board, and Air Force Council),
and provides the chairs of the Air Force Group and the Air Force Board.
   1.8.1. Directorate of Programs (HQ USAF/A8P). Manages the Air Force Corporate
   Process and is responsible for developing, integrating, analyzing, and defending options
   relating to force structure, readiness, sustainability, and modernization. Force Programmers
   provide HQ USAF/A3O-AT official force structure data, and advise A3O-AT of any
   anticipated changes that have not yet been programmed.
1.9. MAJCOM Responsibilities. MAJCOMs have key aircrew management responsibilities,
which are highlighted in this paragraph and elaborated upon in subsequent chapters and
12                                                              AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


referenced AFIs, to facilitate maintaining an aircrew force whose size and readiness enable it to
accomplish the Air Force mission. For purposes of this AFI, MAJCOM/DO also refers to A3s
and Xos. Also, for this AFI, ANG is considered a MAJCOM. MAJCOM responsibilities
include:
     1.9.1. Readiness. MAJCOMs with operational units (i.e., ACC, AMC, ANG, AFRC,
     AFSOC, AFSPC, PACAF, and USAFE) will:
        1.9.1.1. Establish operational experience criteria/mix and average time on station (TOS)
        objectives by API (i.e., 1/2/9/A). Submit them, as well as any requests for changes once
        established, to HQ USAF/A3O for approval.
        1.9.1.2. Work closely with their respective personnel centers to maintain the unit
        manning objective of 100% to the maximum extent possible for operational units. When
        operational unit manning exceeds 100%, readiness is negatively impacted. However, the
        reality of an environment of production-based FTU goals (versus absorption-based),
        coupled with an ever dwindling aircraft force structure may result in overmanning of
        flying units. The challenge to aircrew managers, AFPC in particular, is to monitor and
        manage unit manning overages as effectively and efficiently as possible. Overmanning,
        when required, is only authorized for line billets (i.e., API‘s 1, 2, 9, and A). AFPC will
        publish periodic reports to ensure MAJCOMs and Air Staff are kept apprised of current
        and forecast manning.
            1.9.1.2.1. AFI 11-401 limits staff and flight surgeon flying positions. If approved for
            over manning of staff or flight surgeon API billets and there is an increase in a flying
            unit‘s mission requiring additional staff or flight surgeon operational flying support
            over current manning authorizations, process a double billeting aeronautical order
            ―flying‖ waiver request IAW AFI 11-401.
        1.9.1.3. Establish hours per aircrew member per month (HCM) objectives for
        inexperienced API-1/2/9/A aircrew members, and submit them (as well as any requests
        for changes once established) to HQ USAF/A3O for approval.
        1.9.1.4. Provide Mission Design Series (MDS) and Major Weapon System (MWS)
        actual experience mix, average TOS, manning, and HCM data to lead commands for
        quarterly submission to HQ USAF/A1PP and HQ USAF/A3O-AT.
     1.9.2. Absorption.
        1.9.2.1. Lead MAJCOMs with operational units provide AF Distribution Plan inputs
        based on the absorption guidance in Chapter 3 (Absorption) and the procedures outlined
        in Chapter 4 (Recruiting/Accessions and Training/Production).
        1.9.2.2. Manage the Total Force Absorption Program (TFAP) and Fighter Associate
        Program (FAP) as directed in the TFAP CONOPS and FAP MOA, respectively.
     1.9.3. Training. Training serves two principal purposes for the Air Force. First and
     foremost it is the facilitator and supplier of qualified aircrew to feed and sustain the aircrew
     management system and aircrew force. Second, training is provided to Sister Services,
     international partner nations and other agencies in support of national and DoD policy.
     While there are several MAJCOMs that conduct formal training, AETC is the designated
     lead agency for training and provides leadership through AETC/A3R who chairs the ATMS
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   13


  and assists in framing the Aircrew Training and Distribution Requirements process outlined
  in Chapter 4 of this instruction. Nonetheless, MAJCOMs have training responsibilities:
     1.9.3.1. MAJCOMs and other components/agencies that require formal aircrew training
     will submit their requirements IAW Aircrew Training and Distribution Requirements
     (ATDR) process for inclusion in AF Distribution Plans, Undergraduate Programmed
     Requirements Document (UPRD), and Graduate Programmed Requirements Document
     (GPRD), as applicable. See Chapter 4 (Recruiting/Accessions and Training/Production).
     1.9.3.2. MAJCOMs that conduct formal aircrew training will coordinate with the Air
     Staff (AF/A3O-AT/A8PC/A1MR/A1PP) any changes to formal training syllabi that may
     affect student production levels/flow (e.g., changing the B course length because the
     increase changes a members‘ status from TDY to PCS), training resources/personnel
     (e.g., aircraft, simulators, instructors), etc.
  1.9.4. Manpower Requirements. All MAJCOMs are responsible for limiting or strictly
  controlling aircrew requirements growth for organizations/functions within their purview,
  and for providing HQ USAF/A3O-AT the results of their annual aircrew requirements review
  (ref AFI 38-201, Ch 11). In addition, MAJCOMs with Air Component roles are charged
  with limiting/controlling AF aircrew requirements, including both PCS personnel exchange
  program (PEP) / extended training service support (ETSS) billets and continuously manned
  TDY slots within the area of responsibility, in Unified Commands. Other MAJCOMs have
  oversight responsibility due to functional relationships or proximity. See Chapter 5 for
  additional details. MAJCOM/Manpower Offices must validate requested changes to
  manpower positions and ensure AF/A3O-AT concurs with changes prior to updating unit
  manpower documents.
     1.9.4.1. Aircrew Ratio (ACR) and Aircrew Composition. MAJCOMs with
     operational flying units and the ANG are required to submit aircrew ratio/composition
     change requests with justification to lead MAJCOMs (if applicable). Requests should be
     forwarded IAW AFI 38-201, Chapter 11, for approval. Lead MAJCOMs, in close
     coordination with other affected MAJCOMs/ANG and AF/A5R, also submit proposed
     aircrew ratios/composition and associated justification as part of the initial capabilities
     document (ICD) for aircraft scheduled to enter the AF‘s operational inventory (these
     ICDs require AF/A3O coordination). MAJCOMs/ANG requests must include a detailed
     aircrew ratio/composition analysis/justification that addresses both mission tasking levels
     and aircrew readiness (i.e., shows that sorties/crewmember/month available will
     meet/exceed SCM required to maintain mission ready status).                  If approved,
     MAJCOMs/ANG will need to include the new crew ratio in its budget computations to
     compete for funding. Once funded, AF/A3O-AT will ensure appropriate changes are
     made to AFI 65-503, U.S. Air Force Cost and Planning Factors. Submit changes to AFI
     65-503, Tables A36-1/A37-1/A38-1 to AF/A8PM. Additionally, ANG and AFRC are
     required to submit to AF/A3O/A1M for approval/coordination the breakout between
     Active, Technician, and Traditional Guard/Reserve authorizations and provide by-
     squadron total line aircrew authorization data to AF/A3O/A1M for
     approval/coordination.
     1.9.4.2. Programmed Flying Training (PFT) Instructor Aircrew Authorizations. As
     the PFT student load changes, instructor authorizations will likely change. MAJCOMs
14                                                             AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


        that conduct formal aircrew training will submit instructor aircrew authorization manning
        and any change requests to AF/A1M for coordination and to AF/A3O for approval (see
        Chapter 5, Aircrew Manpower Requirements). In addition to complying with the above
        coordination/approval guidance, AFRC and ANG are required to submit to
        AF/A3O/A1M for approval/coordination the breakout between Active, Technician, and
        Traditional Guard/Reserve authorizations and provide by-squadron total line aircrew
        authorization data to AF/A3O/A1M for approval/coordination.
     1.9.5. Inventory Management.
        1.9.5.1. Rated Staff Allocation Plans (see chapter 7). Ensure the effective use of rated
        resources by allocating entitlements in these plans to appropriately address current and
        future requirements (e.g., development and leadership).
        1.9.5.2. Alternate Manning (see chapter 7). Submit alternate manning requests to HQ
        USAF/A1P for coordination and to HQ USAF/A3O for approval. If a request involves
        changes to aircrew manpower authorizations, it will also require AF/A1M coordination.
     1.9.6. Lead Command. AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating Command Weapon Systems
     Management, designates lead commands. For aircrew management purposes, lead

1.13. Operational Flying Wing Guidelines. This AFI does not mandate aircrew management
responsibilities for Wing and Operations Group Commanders; however, some of the points
outlined below are AF guidance for aircrew managers. The following paragraphs are offered as
information to assist wing leadership in effectively managing its aircrews.
   1.13.1. Authorized squadron/wing manning level, by crew position, is 100%. Overmanning
   may be necessary in order to maintain squadron experience mix or when overproduction
   and/or a decrease in force structure occurs.
   1.13.2. If additional manning is needed due to a permanent increase in mission taskings,
   consider submitting a request for a crew ratio increase through channels to the
   MAJCOM/DO/A3, who will in turn coordinate with the MDS lead MAJCOM and forward
   the request IAW AFI 38-201 Determining Manpower Requirements.
   1.13.3. Equitably balance assigned and attached experienced aircrews among squadrons.
   This does not necessarily mean that each unit should receive a proportional share of
   inexperienced inbound personnel. For example, if a fighter wing has two squadrons (one 18
   PMAI and one 24 PMAI), and an overmanning [of inexperienced aircrews] situation exists, a
16                                                           AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


     higher percentage of inexperienced aircrews should be assigned to the 24 PMAI squadron –
     beyond the proportional percentage – as the larger squadron will typically have a better
     ability to absorb inexperienced members (more aircraft, instructors, etc.).
     1.13.4. Generally, experienced aircrews should fly in flight lead / instructor / aircraft
     commander positions. They should only fill inexperienced crew positions when dictated by
     the mission, when necessary to instruct/evaluate, or when unit experience mix is such that
     experienced aircrews can fly in inexperienced crew positions without reducing the Hours per
     Crewmember per Month (HCM)/Sorties per Crewmember per Month (SCM) rates of
     inexperienced aircrews. To the maximum extent possible/practical, limit attached flyers
     (especially API-8s and Ds) to the minimum number needed to accomplish the mission.
     1.13.5. Line (API-1/2/9/A) aircrews have priority for flying over staff (APIs-6/8 and B/D),
     and API-6/8 Flight Leads / Acs / Instructors have priority over API-6/8 CPs / non-FLs / non-
     Instructors. Flight surgeons have last priority among aircrew members. Pilot-physicians
     have priority for flying commensurate with their qualifications and experience as determined
     by the flying organization commander (see AFI 11-405, The Pilot-Physician Program, for
     detailed guidance on Pilot-Physicians).
     1.13.6. Encourage development of institutional competencies in assigned personnel (i.e.,
     leadership, management, and cross-cutting warfighter competencies).
1.14. Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and Other Non-
MAJCOM Organizations. FOAs, DRUs, and other non-MAJCOM organizations are required
to submit any formal flying and aircrew survival school training requirement inputs to HQ
USAF/A3O-AT for inclusion in AF Distribution Plans, UPRDs, and GPRDs. See Chapter 4
(Recruiting/Accessions and Training/Production).
1.15. Waiver Authority. Waiver authority for this AFI is AF/A3O-A.

                         AIRCREW MANAGEMENT APPROACH

2.1. Objective. The overall aircrew management objective is to maintain an aircrew force
whose readiness and size enable it to effectively accomplish the Air Force‘s current and forecast
mission.
2.2. Readiness-Sustainment Balance. One of the major challenges in Aircrew Management is
determining and achieving the appropriate balance between readiness and sustainment. To
achieve the ―readiness‖ part of the objective, units must have enough experienced aircrews
(especially including unit supervision/leadership) and sorties/hours per crewmember per month
(S/HCM) to effectively prepare for and conduct operational missions/taskings. Achieving the
―sustainment‖ aspect of the objective necessitates that sufficient numbers of aircrews are
accessed, produced, absorbed/experienced, and retained, and that a healthy Line (i.e., Ops units)
to Staff (e.g., HHQ; Test; Joint) manpower requirements ratio is maintained. Effective aircrew
management requires constant attention, MDS/MWS-specific incremental adjustments within a
logical range/band, and fully coordinated actions that make sense for both the short and long
term. The many facets and factors of aircrew management are inextricably linked; changing one
factor typically affects/changes several others. The main tenets of aircrew management are
outlined in Figure 2.1, and discussed further in subsequent chapters. Figure 2.2 is a simple
depiction of the Aircrew Management System from accessions through training, into operational
units, then on to ―experienced requirements‖.

2.3. Aircrew Management Policy. HQ USAF/A3O-AT formulates Air Force aircrew
management policy and guidance for CSAF, HQ USAF/A3/5 or HQ/A3O approval. HQ
USAF/A1PP is the OPR for related aircrew personnel policy development that works in
conjunction with A3O-AT‘s aircrew management policies. As practical, policies should be
consistent with the Force Development construct outlined in AFPD 36-26 (Total Force
Development) and its subordinate documents.

                                         ABSORPTION

3.1. Definition. Absorption is the process of accessing new undergraduate flying training
(UFT) graduates and/or prior qualified (e.g., FAIP, OSA) aircrews, by career field (i.e., Pilot;
CSO/Nav/EWO/WSO; ABM; CEA) into operational unit line flying positions (i.e., API-1/2/9/A)
for their first operational assignment.
3.2. Absorption (Goal/Capacity). The AF‘s goal is to balance the long-term need to sustain an
inventory that meets requirements with the near-term goal of maintaining unit readiness
parameters. Stated another way, the goal is to absorb the required number of new aircrews while
maintaining at least the minimum unit readiness posture of experience mix, average time on
station, and manning levels required to meet operational taskings/commitments. Programmed
absorption capacity is the maximum number of new aircrews that can be hired per year within
programmed resources (i.e., force structure, initial training quotas and flying hours) necessary to
maintain at least the minimum unit readiness posture. MAJCOMs should make every effort to
program sufficient resources to ensure absorption capacity is in balance with both long-term
requirements and near-term readiness parameters. Using pilots as an example, Figure 3.1 shows
the relationship of the basic elements of aircrew management (e.g., accessions; training;
absorption in the ops units; experienced requirements, requal/upgrade training). Included in the
figure is the ―normal‖ flow of ARC pilots. ARC pilots are of 3 varieties: 1) Home grown (i.e.,
commissioned from within), 2) Access experienced pilots from the Active Duty, and 3) Members
gained from sister command/services. Recruiting and retention are of greatest concern in
sustaining and nurturing experienced pilot in the ARC.

Figure 3.1. Elements of the Aircrew Management System.




3.3. Key Absorption Points:
     3.3.1. The primary absorption factors are:
        3.3.1.1. Total active duty requirements (i.e., force, training, staff, students, AFIT/PME
        and Transient)
        3.3.1.2. Active operational force structure (i.e., absorbable cockpits, based upon PMAI
        and CR, in a unit)
        3.3.1.3. Programmed training (initial and continuation)
        3.3.1.4. Programmed flying hours per crewmember per month (HCM)
        3.3.1.5. Readiness parameters (experience mix, average time on station, and manning
        level).
     3.3.2. The only place new aircrews can be assigned to become experienced aviators is to
     API-1/2/9/A positions in operational units (although not all line positions are ―absorbable
     billets‖). Additionally, the objective for Active Duty aircrews is to ―experience‖ individuals
     during their first operational tour (exception – Active Duty short tours such as Korea), or as
     specified in Total Force Initiative guidance.
     3.3.3. Attempting to set absorption levels based on inventory overages or shortfalls is
     problematic and results in insufficient numbers of aircrews and/or reduced unit readiness.
     Regardless of retention/inventory levels, operational squadrons can only effectively absorb a
     set number of new aircrews.
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    21


   3.3.4. Although there are different metrics to assess readiness (e.g., RAP completion;
   Experience Mix; SORTS), effective assessment(s) are a derivative of absorption as the
   principal determinant of unit readiness (specifically in terms of experience mix and
   HCM/SCM).
   3.3.5. Absorption calculations not only determine the number of inexperienced aircrews to
   be assigned to operational units, they also provide the number of experienced and limited
   experience (LIMEX) aircrews required.
   3.3.6. Over-absorption decreases readiness. MAJCOMs should program and fund
   sufficient resources to ensure over-absorption does not occur. When resources are
   insufficient, absorption should be reduced to ensure minimum readiness levels are
   maintained.
   3.3.7. Under-absorption can lead to growing inventory shortfalls, inability to man critical
   training cockpits, limitations on developmental career opportunities, and severely
   undermanned staffs.
   3.3.8. The programmed number of aircrew members to be absorbed is the basis for the UFT
   and IFF/FTU formal flying training capacity required, which in turn drives the number of
   new accessions (recruits and cross-trainees) needed each year.
3.4. Absorption Dynamics/Calculations. Determining absorption levels is a critical core
aircrew management task. Numerous factors affect absorption, and changing one variable may
necessitate changing another to obtain an accurate calculation of absorption capacity.
Subparagraphs 3.4.3 through 3.4.7 address the variables that affect absorption.
   3.4.1. Absorption Sustainment Calculations. The first step in determining absorption is to
   calculate the yearly absorption needed to sustain your total requirements. This is done by
   dividing your end-FYDP or out-year programmed total requirement, by your best estimate of
   turn-over rate (for most career fields) or Total Active Rated Service (TARS) for rated forces.
   If at all possible, MAJCOMs should attempt to program sufficient resources (training and
   flying hours) to be able to absorb to this sustainment absorption number. However, this
   number may exceed the maximum absorption constrained by available resources and
   readiness constraints. In that case, absorption to readiness calculations becomes necessary.
   3.4.2. Absorption Readiness Calculations. Properly sizing absorption to readiness is
   basically deriving the mathematical solution to a series of equations. The solution set is a
   function of force variables such as ―cockpit‖ authorizations, experience parameters,
   programmed aging rates, and assignment stability (time-on-station) criteria, and other
   MAJCOM parameters.
   3.4.3. Operational Line (API-1/-2/-9/-A) Positions. Operational line positions are those in
   the operational flying squadrons, excluding the squadron commander and operations officer
   (API-6s); they are the core of the AF‘s combat/operational capability. In general, the greater
   the number of Active Component (AC) line positions, the greater the
   combat/absorption/sustainability capabilities and the lower the required aging rate necessary
   to sustain a fixed overhead requirement. The number of line operational positions,
   principally determined by force structure and aircrew ratio/composition, is the single-
   most important determinant of absorption capacity.
22                                                            AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


        3.4.3.1. The number of operational line positions is calculated by multiplying the number
        of Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI) assigned to each squadron times crew
        composition times aircrew ratio, then adding all the squadron API-1s/-2s/-9s/-As to get
        an aggregate number. NOTE: In a few instances, Primary Other Aircraft Inventory
        (POAI) is used instead of PMAI.
            3.4.3.1.1. Force structure is the sum of the number of PMAI (or POAI) in all the
            operational units. For a variety of reasons, Active Component (AC) aircraft provide
            the lion‘s share of the AF‘s absorption capability. Whether an operational unit can
            accept inexperienced/new aircrews depends on mission/aircraft requirements.
            3.4.3.1.2. Aircrew Composition and Aircrew Ratio. Aircrew composition/ratio is
            determined by mission requirements and tasking levels, and by aircraft and aircrew
            capabilities/requirements. If an aircraft has a high, sustained sortie generation
            capability, a higher aircrew ratio will be needed to ensure sufficient aircrews are on
            hand. Aircrew ratios are set at a level that enables the line force to operate
            independently (i.e., without augmentation from the wing staff since the staff has
            mission planning and other taskings). If aircrew ratios are set too low, combat
            capability is diminished, OPS/PERSTEMPO is too high, Quality of Life (QOL), and
            retention and flight safety suffer.
        3.4.3.2. Options for increasing absorption via an increase in Active Component
        operational line positions: Acquire more aircraft – sourcing options include: to
        regenerate from Aerospace Maintenance And Regeneration Center (AMARC); transfer
        from the Reserve Component; purchase/lease.
            3.4.3.2.1. Increase aircrew composition or aircrew ratios. Aircrew composition/ratio
            changes are driven by mission and/or tasking level changes. If an aircrew ratio is
            increased, a commensurate flying hour program (FHP) increase would be required to
            enable all line aircrews to maintain the same level of flying currency/proficiency as
            before the increase.
            3.4.3.2.2. Make non-absorbable aircraft absorbable. While mission and aircraft
            requirements determine the unit‘s experienced aircrew requirements, mission changes
            and aircraft/system improvements can result in an initially non-absorbable aircraft
            becoming absorbable. That change is affected by the MAJCOM submitting a request
            to HQ USAF/A3O for approval to reduce the experience mix from the non-
            absorbable 100% number to a lower percentage, such as 75% or 50%, so that
            inexperienced aircrews can be assigned to the unit.
            3.4.3.2.3. Assign Active Component (AC) inexperienced aircrews to the Reserve
            Component (RC – Reserves and Guard). This option increases absorption capacity.
     3.4.4. Hours per Crewmember per Month (HCM). HCM and/or sorties per crewmember
     per month (SCM) are critical variables for determining readiness. For inexperienced pilots,
     HCM (also referred to as the aging rate) is key to calculating experience constrained
     absorption capacity. If insufficient HCM/SCM is programmed, funded, or executed, this
     could contribute to units falling below minimum readiness requirements at required
     absorption levels.
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    23


     3.4.4.1. Ways to increase absorption via an increase in inexperienced aircrew HCM
     include: increasing the FHP, setting limits on the number of attached API-6/-8 flyers to
     only those who can fly as lead or in command, and reducing the frequency and/or number
     of experienced aircrews flying in inexperienced aircrew positions [e.g., NAF API-8
     flying as a wingman or copilots].
     3.4.4.2. Two factors can reduce HCM below needed levels.
         3.4.4.2.1. Great effort must be made to limit unit overmanning to only the level
         supported by funded flying hours…especially inexperienced overmanning. Actual
         overmanning, which is typically the main HCM detractor, is caused by over-
         absorption of inexperienced aircrews. Over-absorption has an adverse synergistic
         effect on HCM in that not only are more inexperienced aircrews competing for
         limited flying hours, but also fewer are able to upgrade to AC/FL status which would
         have enabled them to fly more.
         3.4.4.2.2. If a unit is unable to fully execute its Flying Hour Program (FHP) (due
         to logistics/maintenance factors [undermanned in experienced maintainers,
         insufficient O&M funds, lack of spare parts, lack of available aircraft due to
         modifications or insufficient Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)/Attrition Reserve
         (AR), etc.], funding, and so on), HCM will decline.
     3.4.4.3. Primarily regarding fighter aircraft, wing/squadron size and composition can
     impact HCM in a number of ways. Air Force policy is to robust / level squadrons and
     wings where able, and to make wings as homogeneous (same MDS aircraft throughout)
     as practical. Regarding size, if a fighter wing has three 24 PMAI aircraft-equipped
     squadrons, it will normally be able to generate more sorties/hours (i.e., fly at a higher
     aircraft utilization rate) than a wing equipped with two 18 PMAI squadrons. From both
     maintenance/logistics and operations perspectives, larger wings/squadrons have improved
     scheduling flexibility for generating sorties; also, they are able to share/pool manpower
     and resources easier. Similarly, the more homogeneous the wing, the greater its
     sortie/hour generation capability. Composite wings that have three squadrons, each
     comprised of a different type aircraft, essentially operate as three stand-alone squadrons
     and do not have the benefits of wings with like aircraft. Small wings often have lower
     HCM/SCM than large wings; since wing staffs are fairly standard in size, small wings
     have fewer aircraft/sorties/hours to support a larger percentage of attached flyers than the
     larger wings. Where practical, 24UE squadrons will be the goal. Due to force posture,
     political, fiscal, and other factors, in the near term, leveling units within existing wings
     (e.g., converting 18 and 24 PMAI squadrons in a wing to 21 PMAI) may be a practical
     expedient.
  3.4.5. Manning. Operational squadrons/wings manned at 100% are optimum level for
  absorption, readiness, and sustainability/retention. If overmanning occurs and experience
  mix is not an issue, then the wing/group staff (including OSS) should bear the burden of any
  aircrew overage; however, overmanning is most often caused by a unit having too many
  inexperienced aircrew members who need to remain assigned to the squadron to maximize
  flying opportunities. If a wing under-manning situation should occur, the wing/group staff
  (including OSS) should bear the burden of any aircrew shortfall such that the squadrons
  continue to be manned at 100% to maintain full combat capability. While undermanning
24                                                             AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


     does tend to increase HCM/SCM, those advantages are outweighed by significant
     disadvantages, including reduced combat capability, reduced absorption capability, and
     higher PERSTEMPO (and resulting adverse retention effects). The formulas for calculating
     squadron manning are at Attachment 3. As a general rule, AFPC mans to the wing. The
     wings, in turn, ensure that manning is appropriately distributed to squadron, group, and wing
     positions. AFPC periodically reports wing-level manning data. Another general rule is that
     an aircrew member is considered ‗assigned‘ when they appear on the UMD. NOTE: HQ
     AFPC/DPA is approval authority for overmanning actions and exceptions to the ‗assigned‘
     rule.
        3.4.5.1. Line API-1s/-2s/-9s/-As. Except for the operations officer and squadron
        commander, who are coded as API-6s, operational squadrons are manned by line
        aircrews. They are the UTC-tasked personnel who maintain CMR status, and must
        continually be ready to meet operational taskings.
        3.4.5.2. Staff API-6/B/8/D. Except for the squadron operations officer and squadron
        commander, who are assigned to the squadron, API-6s/Bs (wing level and below staff)
        and API-8s/Ds (above-wing-level staff) are attached to squadrons for flying purposes.
        Some staff API-6s/Bs, such as standardization/evaluation aircrew members and
        weapons/tactics officers, have duties that require them to maintain CMR status; however,
        the majority of API-6s/Bs and all API-8s/Ds are required to maintain basic mission
        capability (BMC) / instrument qualification status. Since all API-6s/Bs/8s/Ds should be
        experienced aircrew members, they have fewer sortie requirements than inexperienced
        line aircrew members. Also, in general, API-6s/Bs/8s/Ds best contribute to the squadrons
        when the CMR aircrews are instructors / flight examiners and the BMC aircrews are
        aircraft commanders (Acs) / flight leads (FLs). If not AC/FL or instructor qualified, these
        experienced aircrew members occupy inexperienced aircrew positions to get their flying
        time, thus adversely affecting individual/unit combat capability/readiness and absorption
        capability.
            3.4.5.2.1. AFI 11-401 limits staff and flight surgeon flying positions. If approved for
            over manning of staff or flight surgeon API billets and there is an increase in a flying
            unit‘s mission requiring additional staff or flight surgeon operational flying support
            over current manning authorizations, process a double billeting aeronautical order
            ―flying‖ waiver request IAW AFI 11-401.
        3.4.5.3. Flight Surgeons, Pilot-Physicians, and Exchange Officers. API-5s (flight
        surgeons and pilot-physicians) may be assigned or attached to squadrons. Exchange
        officers should occupy experienced aircrew positions in the wing/squadron. However,
        since many exchange officers (whether from other countries or other Services) have
        become experienced in a different aircraft (e.g., USN F/A-18 pilot assigned to a USAF F-
        16 unit) with different missions and different procedures, they understandably may not be
        able to serve as a FL/IP/SEFE as soon or as effectively as their USAF counterpart on
        exchange to their country/Service and can have adverse effects on a unit.
            3.4.5.3.1. Approved overmanning authorized by this AFI applies to manning only,
            not flying. AFI 11-401 limits staff and flight surgeon flying positions. AFI 11-401
            authorizes inactive and double billeted flight surgeons to fly on a non-interference
            basis. If approved for over manning of an API 5 billet and there is an increase in a

         over current manning authorizations, process a double billeting aeronautical order
         ―flying‖ waiver request IAW AFI 11-401.
  3.4.6. Experience. When referring to Experience, it is essential to differentiate between
  experience levels for personnel and operational purposes. For personnel purposes, AFPC
  uses hours as a metric to determine when an aircrew member becomes experienced. AFPC
  forecasts wing manning and experience levels using this metric. Based on this forecast,
  AFPC programs appropriate assignment actions to maintain adequate Experience levels in
  Ops units. For operational purposes, MAJCOMs use the term experienced to specify when
  an aircrew member has upgraded or is ready to upgrade to a flight leadership position (e.g.,
  aircraft commander, flight lead, instructor). There are three elements of Experience:
  Criteria – based on hours flown, previous flight experience (i.e., FAIP, previously
  experienced), or squadron leadership recommendation. Experience criteria should not be a
  substitute for training currency or mission ready qualification metrics. Objective –
  minimum number of crew ratio-earned unit authorizations which must be occupied by
  Experienced aircrew members; expressed as a percentage; assumes 100% unit manning;
  determined by MAJCOM and approved by AF/A3O. Mix – actual percentage of
  Experienced and Inexperienced aircrews. There are several variable and constant factors that
  affect Experiencing. The variables are Ops unit manning, hours/sorties per crew per month
  (H/SCM), Time on Station (objective and actual) and relative unit manning mix (i.e.,
  Experienced; Previously Qualified Pilot; Limited Experienced; Inexperienced). Adjustments
  are made primarily through the assignment process. The constants are mandated metrics
  (e.g., 55% experience objective for operational fighter units) and production goals (e.g., 1100
  pilots per year). Generally, as experience mix increases, combat capability increases. Of
  course, closely tied to the (unit‘s) experience mix are HCM/SCM and the Ready Aircrew
  Program (RAP). Mission/aircraft requirements principally dictate a unit‘s minimum required
  experience mix.       Included in the mission experience requirement is the unit‘s
  leadership/supervision (API-6 squadron commander, operations officer, and wing staff API-6
  positions/manning are excluded from squadron experience mix calculations), which is
  integral to the unit‘s success. Along with the other absorption factors (e.g., number of
  operational API-1 positions, HCM, manning levels, average TOS), experience mix is a key
  variable in determining the optimum absorption level. An MDS‘s objective experience mix
  is the greater of the mission/aircraft-driven minimum experience mix and the optimum
  experience mix for absorption. For example, as of FY2000 the F-117's mission/aircraft
  requirements called for 100% experience mix, while the optimum experience mix for
  absorption was 55%; therefore, the F-117 objective experience mix was 100%. For the F-16
  MDS, the experience mix for mission/aircraft requirements and absorption coincided at 55%.
  Maintaining the squadron objective experience mix (see Atch 5) or higher is essential for
  optimizing unit combat capability/readiness and sustainability (absorption/retention/Quality
  of Life), as well as for ensuring key supervisory/leadership positions are properly manned.
  Over-absorption compromises both combat readiness/capability and sustainability.
     3.4.6.1. Maintaining the objective experience mix ensures sufficient numbers of
     experienced aircrews (e.g., Flight Leads; Aircraft Commanders) are available to meet
     sortie tasking levels (combat capability). From an absorption perspective, it sets the
     experienced-inexperienced aircrew mix such that a maximum number of inexperienced
26                                                              AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


        aircrews can be brought into a unit while flying at an HCM/SCM rate that enables them
        to meet at least minimum RAP/readiness requirements.
        3.4.6.2. Experience Criteria. Experience criteria are a combination of the number and
        type hours (i.e., total and/or mission aircraft) an aircrew member must fly to be
        designated "experienced." As detailed in MDS-specific instructions, CEA and other non-
        rated aircrew experience are determined by an individual's time holding a specific AFSC
        and performing duties in a weapon system. Experience criteria are recommended by
        MAJCOMs and approved by AF/A3O. The formula for calculating squadron experience
        mix is at Attachment 3. NOTE: MAJCOM Experience Criteria is annotated in the
        respective MDS Vol 1‘s; additional criteria are available at the ‗Aircrew Requirements‘
        Community           of        Practice        maintained          by        AF/A3O-AT
        (https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AF-87).
        3.4.6.3. For pilot aircrew managers, another way to affect experience mix is to vary the
        mix between SUPT graduates ("SUPTs") and prior-qualified pilots (PQPs -- pilots, such
        as FAIPs and OSA pilots, whose first flying tour is not in a MWS aircraft). Because
        PQPs enter operational units with more total time than SUPTs, PQPs experience
        sooner (assumes at least 1000 hours flight time upon arrival at the new operational
        squadron).
     3.4.7. Average Time on Station (TOS). Average TOS is the average tour length (e.g., 3.0
     years) for operational line aircrews. It directly influences unit readiness, QOL, and retention.
     In general order of priority, important considerations for determining an objective average
     TOS include: operational cycles (e.g., 20-month AEF rotations); time to complete checkouts
     in the required mission skills; absorption (especially time to experience a new aircrew
     member, experience mix, and manning level); stability (QOL); formal training and associated
     instructor requirement impacts; and, PCS costs. (NOTE: TOS guidelines may not affect
     ARC units, where an individual may spend his/her entire career in the same unit.)
        3.4.7.1. Average TOS varies by MDS, but is generally optimized between 2.8 and 4.0
        years with the fighters on the low end and other aircraft on the high end of the spectrum.
            3.4.7.1.1. Below 2.8 years, aircrews may not be able to complete needed mission
            checkouts and upgrades (e.g., low altitude airdrops; flight lead), and have less
            assignment stability (shorter tour length); either unit readiness declines, or the
            experienced aircrew input increases above normal levels; and the AF may not be able
            to absorb sufficient numbers of new aircrews (adverse inventory/sustainability
            effects), and will likely incur increased training (including increased instructor
            requirements) and PCS costs.
            3.4.7.1.2. Above 4.0 years, either insufficient positions are filled by unit
            leaders/supervisors and absorption is too low, or units are over-manned; readiness
            declines; career progression and Force Development may suffer; training and PCS
            costs are lower; and, stability is improved.
        3.4.7.2. Operational remote tours are not included in average TOS calculations, but are
        factored into absorption calculations.
3.5. Absorption Guidance. Once absorption levels have been determined by MAJCOMs, they
are approved by AF/A3O in AF distribution plans. Air Force-wide absorption of new aircrews is
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                       27


reflected in the Undergraduate Program Requirements Document (UPRD), which factors in
attrition and aligns aircrew candidates with specific courses/tracks such that MWS goals can be
met. Similarly, the Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) reflects MAJCOM
absorption calculations for both MDS-specific basic/initial and transition/re-qualification training
requirements.

                                             Chapter 4

               RECRUITING/ACCESSIONS AND TRAINING/PRODUCTION

4.1. Overview. This chapter will deal with Training/Production both as a key element in the
USAF Total Force (Active Duty, AFRC, and ANG) aircrew management system covered by this
instruction and as a mechanism for supporting the training requirements of other customers of
Air Force flying training programs (such as international training and training provided for other
services/agencies). As an element of aircrew management, training (and the associated
throughput requirements) provides graduates with the required skills and in sufficient quantity to
sustain the aircrew force. Training/production and recruiting/accessions are tied to the
absorption capability of the operational units and to the numbers required to sustain the overall
aircrew force while meeting CSAF goals. While training has both a throughput (production
quantity) and content aspect, this chapter will focus on the process by which the production
requirements are established, collected, validated, approved and documented.
     4.1.1. Production requirements sources. For convenience we can categorize the flying
     training production requirements by five broad ―source categories‖. These are:
        4.1.1.1. Active duty. Lead commands (ACC, AMC, AFSOC, and AFSPC) are
        responsible for collecting, validating, and submitting active duty production
        requirements.
        4.1.1.2. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). AFRC/A3T is responsible for
        collecting and forwarding validated AFRC production requirements to AF/A3O-AT.
        4.1.1.3. Air National Guard (ANG). NGB/A3T is responsible for collecting and
        forwarding validated Guard production requirements to AF/A3O-AT.
        4.1.1.4. International training requirements. SAF/IA is responsible for collecting,
        validating, and submitting international flying training requirements in accordance with
        the procedures outlined in this chapter of the instruction.
        4.1.1.5. Other flying training requirements. This category encompasses sister service
        and other US agencies that require formal training conducted by USAF formal training
        schoolhouses. AF/A3O-AT will collect these requirements for inclusion in the
        appropriate Programmed Requirements Document (PRD).
     4.1.2. Recruiting/Accessions and Training/Production relationships. The central
     objective of the processes outlined in this chapter is to identify and codify the key
     relationships among the elements that result in a predictable and efficient flow of qualified
     graduate aviators to the operational units to sustain combat capability and sustain the overall
     aircrew force. Understanding the linkage between force structure, absorption capability,
     recruiting/accessions requirements, and training/production requirements is critical to
     maintaining a healthy aircrew force and meeting the mission requirements for which this
     aircrew force is generated. Figure 4.1 below displays a simplified diagram of these key
     relationships and becomes the foundation for the guidance provided in subsequent sections of
     this chapter.
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    29


Figure 4.1. Absorption - Recruiting/Accessions - Training/Production Dynamics.




4.2. Recruiting/Accessions. Overarching recruiting/accession guidance is laid out in AFPDs
36-20 Accession of Air Force Military Personnel and 36-26 Total Force Development. AFI 36-
2616 Trained Personnel Requirements specifies that HQ USAF/A3O-AT sets UFT production
rates based on MAJCOM absorption capability; therefore, recruiting/accession levels for aircrew
candidates and aircrew training/production requirements are based on the absorption level
requested by operational MAJCOMs (and ANG) and approved by AF/A3O. AF/A1P applies
historical attrition factors [AF/A3O approved numbers provided by AETC/A3R] to the
absorption level to determine how many new aircrews need to be recruited/accessed. AF/A1P
coordinates to adjust the recruiting/accession goals for, intra-, inter-Service transfers, then
allocates the remaining quotas to the sources of commissioning (SOCs). For instance, if the
aggregate attrition rate for pilot training is 10% and required absorption is 1000, then the AF
would access 1000  .90 = 1111 pilots. In turn, HQ USAF/A1PPR develops for HQ USAF/A1
approval, the rated Trained Personnel Requirement (TPR), which is published by 1 December
each year. HQ USAF/A1PP ensures the approved rated TPR is incorporated into the overall
Officer TPR.
   4.2.1. CEA Accession Plan. CEA accession plan is developed as part of the TPR process.
   Based on AF/A3O-AT and other functional inputs, AF/A1PT develops for HQ USAF/A1
   approval, the TPR. It is published during the first two months of the first and third fiscal
   quarters. The TPR document is a statement of the gains to each AFSC, Special Duty
   Identifier (SDI), and Reporting Identifier (RI), by fiscal year, needed to maintain the active
   officer and enlisted airman force at programmed manning levels. It is used at the Training
   Flow Management Conference and the Training Planning Meeting to develop the enlisted
   training program. Authorizations used to determine requirements are based on programs
30                                                             AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


     reflected in the current budget cycle, as they are included in the Central Manpower Data
     Bank and adjusted in the Skills Programming Model. The adjustments are based on Program
     Element Code changes that either have not been allocated as changes or extended on the
     manpower files. Amendments to the TPR will be issued when changing authorizations,
     accessions, losses, or production adversely impact programmed manning levels.
     4.2.2. Intra-Service and Inter-Service Transfers (ISTs). Most aircrew candidates enter
     the Air Force as new recruits/accessions; exceptions include limited intra- and inter-Service
     transfers (ISTs) and voluntary extended Active Duty for Air Reserve Component
     commissioned officers. In cases where the accessions were already rated (e.g., U.S. Army
     helicopter pilot ISTs), their AF aeronautical ratings and training needs are determined IAW
     AFI 11-402 (Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges). ISTs are
     included in the total accession numbers; e.g., if the AF needs to access 1100 pilots and has 50
     ISTs, it would need 1050 new recruits. Not factoring in ISTs would overload training and
     cause over-absorption in the operational units.
     4.2.3. Awaiting PCS Training (APT) Pool. The APT pool is the group of UFT selectees
     who are waiting for a slot/quota to begin undergraduate flying training. Having a small APT
     pool affords training quota managers the flexibility to fill all quotas by
     minimizing/eliminating training vacancies that would otherwise occur due to last-minute
     dropouts/no-shows. Periodically reviewing/updating attrition factors to keep them accurate
     and smoothing the summer spike, to the maximum extent practical, will help prevent the
     APT pool from growing too large. Should the APT pool become excessive, AETC and
     AF/A1P/A3O will take steps to adjust future accessions to enable the pool to be reduced in a
     timely manner. Drawbacks of an excessive APT pool include extensive pre-UFT delays that
     result in these personnel counting against end strengths yet being of very limited utility,
     adverse effects on accessions into other AFSCs if caused by over-accessing into aircrew
     career fields, Force Development repercussions, and a poor initial impression of the USAF.
     Also, aircrew managers should be reluctant to support the establishment of programs that
     seek to use APT pool manpower overseas and/or for periods exceeding three months. Such
     programs can have the unintended detrimental consequence of unfilled UFT quotas.
     Conversely, too small of an APT pool will result in training vacancies for last-minute
     dropouts/no-shows going unfilled. Members assigned to the APT Pool should be focused on
     developing operational and/or institutional competencies while awaiting training.
4.3. Training/Production. As with accessions, the absorption level is the basis for required
student production (i.e., number of graduates) from both formal undergraduate and graduate
flying training courses. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of determining absorption levels.
Absorption calculations are used to determine not only the amount of IFF/FTU initial
qualification training required for new aircrews, but also the number of FTU re-
qualification/transition training quotas needed for experienced aircrews returning to operational
duty. In turn, required student production levels (i.e., required training capacity) drive training
resources/personnel (e.g., aircraft, FHP, and training instructor requirements).
Training/production is most effective and efficient when training is smooth-flowed throughout
the year and when non-flying activities (e.g., ASBC, Flight Screening) are accomplished first,
followed by flying training with good continuity (i.e., minimal breaks in training) from UFT
through mission ready status at operational units. However, the ―summer spikes‖ of AF-bound
high school and college graduates who must enter Active Duty (commissioned officers within
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                      31


180 days of commissioning) and AF aircrews graduating from PME and returning to flying,
combined with breaks in training (BITs) and varying FTU course start dates, often present
significant training pipeline management challenges. The following subparagraphs cover the
AF‘s processes and timelines for managing and funding aircrew training/production. AF/A3O-
AT has management responsibility for aircrew training/production.                       Forecasting
training/production requirements is critical, and the planning process must begin at least 18
months prior to the execution year to ensure inputs are incorporated into AF
programming/budgeting schedules. Ideally, instructor and other resources needed to provide the
training are identified a year earlier than that, so that they will be ready and in-place when the
training actually begins.
   4.3.1. Aircrew Training and Distribution Requirements (ATDR) process. The ATDR
   process provides a disciplined, time/sequence based set of procedures for establishing,
   collecting, validating and documenting flying training production requirements for all formal
   training conducted by or for the Air Force. In broad terms the process starts with a formal
   data call to the key ―customer‖ agencies requesting unconstrained but realistic training
   requirements and leads, through a series of steps and accompanying documents, to a
   constrained program guidance letter upon which the formal programming and funding
   activities can be based that will result in a funded executable training program for the Air
   Force. The following outlines these specific steps and documents sequentially through a
   complete ATDR cycle. This cycle parallels and syncs with the PPBS cycle. The objective of
   this disciplined process and the document set outlined below is to provide both an orderly
   progression from the initial, unconstrained but realistic requirements inputs from the
   ―customers‖ and to provide a complete and accurate audit trail for all the steps in this process
   for a given PPBS cycle from initial data call through to the PFT document which provides
   the plan/schedule for executing the training requirements.
       4.3.1.1. Requirements Data Call.
           4.3.1.1.1. Description. The Data Call starts the annual ATDR cycle. It is a
           solicitation of valid, unconstrained, realistic, requirements from the five customer
           ―sources‖ identified in 4.1.1 above. The data call is initiated by AF/A3O-AT and is
           sent to the lead MAJCOMs (for active duty requirements), AFRC, ANG, SAF/IA (for
           international requirements) and to sister service and other agencies (for ―Other‖
           flying training production requirements). The data call document provides dedicated
           tabs for each of these five sources to facilitate the collection and validation of these
           several requirements inputs.
           4.3.1.1.2. Key data call documents and procedural guidance.
               4.3.1.1.2.1. Data Call Documents. There are three key documents to the Data
               Call Process; 1) undergraduate requirements, 2) rated distribution and 3) graduate
               requirements. All three components are in the form of spreadsheets in which
               direct entries are made by the appropriate advocates. All data call documents are
               designed to capture requirements for the next POM cycle and the budget year that
               precedes it (e.g. FY10 POM data call covers the FY09 budget year and FY10-15
               POM years).
                   4.3.1.1.2.1.1. Undergraduate Program Requirements Document (UPRD)
                   Data Call. The UPRD Data Call (includes selective graduate training that

               requires SJUPT/ENJJPT/JSUNT/ABM assets) applies to RegAF, ARC,
               SAF/IA (for international requirements) and other (USN, USMC, USCG,
               etc.). Advocates will collect, validate and submit their unconstrained but
               realistic requirements by updating the data call ―spreadsheet‖ and returning it
               to AF/A3O-AT for consolidation and publication as the Undergraduate
               Program Requirements Document (UPRD).
               4.3.1.1.2.1.2. Rated Distribution Plan (RDP) Data Call. The RDP Data
               Call applies to RegAF only. Lead MAJCOMs are responsible for obtaining
               (from all RegAF users), validating and submitting future requirements for all
               initial Pilot‘s, CSO‘s and ABM‘s. This data call also gathers FAIP/OSA
               requirements and priorities for placement of IFF wash-outs.
               4.3.1.1.2.1.3. Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) Data
               Call. The GPRD Data Call applies to all user MAJCOMs, ARC, SAF/IA IA
               (for international requirements) and other (USN, USMC, USCG etc.). Each
               MAJCOM/agency that owns and controls quotas for flying training is
               responsible for submitting their validated, unconstrained but realistic
               requirements. Additionally, Lead MAJCOMs are responsible for 1)
               coordinating with AFPC/DPAO to collect/submit AFPC‘s requirements and 2)
               ensuring flying training is requested (to include pre-requisite training) for all
               rated personnel requested in the RDP Data Call (or the RDP if it has already
               been published when the GPRD Data Call is initiated).
     4.3.1.2. Rated Distribution Plan (RDP).
        4.3.1.2.1. Description: The RDP documents validated requirements for the
        distribution of all new rated personnel for all MWS‘s. The RDP provides formal
        guidance to AFPC/DPAO for the flow of new rated personnel into FTUs
        (MWS/MDS) over the FYDP. For pilots it includes the distribution of FAIPs,
        Operational Support Aircraft (OSA) and other MWS pilots. However, it DOES NOT
        represent the number of UFT graduates that will be produced in the corresponding
        UPRD and RDP year. The varying lengths of the UFT pipelines means that each RDP
        year is fed by portions of two ―feeder year‖ UFT production year groups. (e.g., FY10
        distribution will be fed by UFT graduates from FY09 and FY10 production). To assist
        MAJCOMs and A3O-AT in developing accurate distribution plans and linking
        distribution to undergraduate production guidance, the distribution plan has added
        programmed UFT ―available graduates‖ numbers from each of the ―feeder years‖ to
        (1) identify disconnects between desired distribution and available graduates and (2)
        allow adjustments to distribution and/or programmed UFT production to align
        distribution and production.
     4.3.1.3. Program Requirements Documents (PRD).
        4.3.1.3.1. Description: The unconstrained requirements from above mentioned data
        calls are compiled and validated for compliance with Air Force Policy/CSAF
        guidance and collated into the UPRD and GPRD. The UPRD contains the aggregate
        requested training for all undergraduate flying training courses, as well as selected
        graduate level training associated with the undergraduate assets. The GPRD contains
        the aggregate requested training for all graduate flying training (except as noted in the
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                     33


        UPRD). The PRD‘s represent formal documentation of the unconstrained
        requirements and realistic for all flying training courses for which the Air Force has
        programming responsibility. Additionally, the budget year information provides
        updated requirements for the PFT Conference and identifies potential opportunities to
        modify near-term UFT production. Combined, these documents form the baseline
        from which the remaining ATDR activities are predicated.
     4.3.1.4. Capacity Analysis and Shortfall Report.
        4.3.1.4.1. Description. Once the data call inputs have been compiled into the
        UPRD/GPRD, AF/A3O-AT will forward these unconstrained requirements to the
        training commands (MAJCOMs charged with the conduct of formal training) to
        identify constraints (if any) that would preclude meeting the requirements
        documented in the PRDs. Training MAJCOMs use the PRD‘s as input to conduct a
        capacity and resource analysis. These constraints may take the form of physical
        capacity limitations and/or resource constraints that limit the production capability by
        program, weapon system or course. This analysis also identifies what would be
        required to overcome these limitations (where possible). The results of this analysis
        will be documented in a Shortfall Report provided to AF/A3O-AT by each training
        command. This information will be briefed to the AF Corporate Structure by way of
        the P&T Panel to determine whether the shortfalls can/should be fixed or accepted.
        When a shortfall exists, the requesting agency (lead MAJCOM for active duty,
        SAF/IA for international requirements, AFRC and ANG, and AF/A3O-AT for
        ―other‖) will be given the opportunity to address the limiting factors or implement a
        training prioritization plan.
        4.3.1.4.2. Key documents and procedures. Two key documents are due from each
        Training MAJCOM, a Capacity Analysis and a Shortfall Report. The Capacity
        Analysis is analysis is simply an expansion of the PRD‘s to document actual
        capacities (for each entry) within the current funded resources. The Shortfall Report
        is a narrative description of the shortfalls along with a description of the limiting
        factors that preclude meeting the full requirement and what would be required to
        overcome this shortfall, along with a quantification of the net shortfall for each
        applicable course where the shortfall exists. The training command may also submit a
        ―Constrained PRD‖ (the original UPRD/GPRD with a recommended reduction in
        requirements which matches capacity) to assist AF/A3O-AT in addressing the
        shortfalls and prioritization of training within capacity limits. The training commands
        will provide the shortfall report for all flying training under their purview. AF/A3O-
        AT will compile the training commands shortfall reports into a consolidated shortfall
        document and present that information, along with recommendations for overcoming
        these shortfalls and priorities for available training where the shortfalls cannot (or are
        not recommended to be) fixed to the AFCS for decision.
     4.3.1.5. Planning Program Guidance Letter (PPGL).
        4.3.1.5.1. After the AF corporate review and decision on priorities (where shortfalls
        are not/cannot be fixed), AF/A3O-AT will produce a prioritized constrained
        requirements document upon which the training commands and customers will base
        their production planning and POM submission. This document will be called the
34                                                        AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


        Planning Program Guidance Letter (PPGL) and represents the formal production
        tasking for the FYDP covered by the ATDR and PPBS cycle being worked. In form
        this document is identical to the PRD except that the requirements are adjusted and
        prioritized to reflect the constraints identified during the capacity analysis and
        corporate review. This document is the result of the deliberation process that either
        prioritizes training to existing capacity or acknowledges and supports the added
        resources required to meet the agreed upon production tasking (in other words what
        the AFCS is willing to fund and/or the lead commands are willing to support)
     4.3.1.6. Approved Program Guidance Letter (PGL).
        4.3.1.6.1. Undergraduate Program Guidance Letter (UPGL). The purpose of the
        UPGL is to close the cycle for that FYDP by dropping the ―P‖ (planning) designation
        to signal that it has passed through the AFCS and PPBS vetting process. The UPPGL
        will be reviewed again following the POM deliberations and amended as required to
        reflect any changes to production and/or priorities that come from the POM as it
        works through the AF corporate process. This approved and funded requirements
        document will be published as UPGL, the final undergraduate step in the ATDR cycle
        for that PPBS sequence. The UPGL is the tasking of record for that cycle (the
        document may be identical to the UPPGL if the POM deliberations do not change the
        requirements published in the UPPGL).
        4.3.1.6.2. Graduate Program Guidance Letter (GPGL). The Graduate PPGL is
        considered final upon publication. However, a GPGL will still be generated to
        document formal tasking for the budget year graduate training requirements. While
        the UPGL will be named for the POM cycle it is matched against, the GPGL will be
        named for the single (execution) year it provides guidance for. The budget year
        information contained in the GPRD (that is not carried forward into the GPPGL) will
        be utilized as a starting point for the annual PFT Conference (see para. 4.3.1.6.2.1.).
        After the PFT Conference is concluded and all required post-conference taskers are
        cleared, the resultant, prioritized plan for the utilization and distribution of the
        available training will be published as the GPGL. The GPGL only covers the budget
        year, is signed by the AF/A3O and is a binding contract between all parties. Training
        commands will ensure initial FTU production and distribution of the resultant course
        quotas are built IAW the GPGL. Subsequent minor changes (except Internationals
        gaining quotas) that are agreed upon by all affected users can be negotiated at
        MAJCOM Action Officer (AO) level. All major changes (significant changes in FTU
        capacity etc.) or potential transfer of USAF quota to international customers must be
        coordinated with AF/A3O-AT and approved by
           4.3.1.6.2.1. Program Flying Training (PFT) Conference. Annually, a training
           command (normally AETC) hosts the AF/A3O PFT Conference which is chaired
           by AF/A3O-AT. The purpose of the PFT conference is to put the final refinement
           on the budget year ATDR cycle (e.g., the Dec 08 PFT Conference would utilize
           budget year date from the FY11 APOM GPRD to finalize PFT allocations for
           FY10 training). The conference is an AO level event tasked with adjudicating the
           unconstrained requirements (GPRD) with available training (actual FTU capacity
           IAW the Capacity Analysis). During the two week conference, an hour or two is
           dedicated to each MWS to achieve this objective. During MWS breakouts each
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                     35


             course is evaluated and where capacity doesn‘t meet GPRD requirements, a
             prioritized distribution is established. A3O-AT makes final distribution decisions.
             Any user who does not receive a minimally acceptable level of training should
             clearly make that known during the MWS breakout. A3O-AT will either, 1) ―open
             a tasker‖ to continue efforts to increase their allocations after the conference (all
             such taskers will be closed with the user prior to final publication of GPGL), or 2)
             direct the user to raise shortage through appropriate military channels. Each MWS
             breakout should be attended by:
                 4.3.1.6.2.1.1. Lead MAJCOMs. Lead MAJCOM representation is
                 mandatory. Lead MAJCOMs will validate/clarify user statements and when
                 applicable provide their perspective of prioritizations.
                 4.3.1.6.2.1.2. FTUs. FTU representation is mandatory if capacity does not
                 meet requirements. FTU representatives are tasked with ensuring that the
                 training allocated at their MWS break-out is executable within their funded
                 and available assets. Additionally, FTU representatives should be prepared to
                 work changes in priorities (e.g. if capacity does not cover demand for a course
                 and priorities are set appropriately, FTU rep should be capable of assessing
                 impacts of reducing other courses to provide the assets required to increase the
                 critical course capacity).
                 4.3.1.6.2.1.3. Users. All user units are welcome to send representation to
                 advocate their requirements. Unit commanders should weigh this invite
                 against the likelihood they will either require advocacy, or provide added
                 value to the conference.        If attendance exceeds facility capacity, a
                 prioritization of attendance will be set by the lead MAJCOM and AF/A3O-
                 AT.
     4.3.1.7. Over/Under Production Plan.          HQ USAF/A3O-AT will establish a
     contingency plan in the event UFT production exceeds or falls short of programmed
     production. This contingency plan for over- and under-production is a formal document
     in the ATDR process and will normally be published in September of each year to
     provide contingency and priority guidance for AFPC and AETC/A3R for pipeline and
     quota management activities. The plan will also be briefed during the AMEC and/or
     ATMS meetings.
  4.3.2. Training Capacity. MAJCOMs (and the ARC) that provide aircrew formal flying
  training are responsible for having sufficient capacity to meet the training requirements
  specified in the PFTs, whose quotas are principally based on operational needs. If training
  capacity is insufficient, MAJCOMS that provide training will coordinate with HQ
  USAF/A3O-AT concerning resolution, and the MAJCOMs may need to take programmatic
  steps to source additional training aircraft, FHP funding, and instructors to increase training
  capacity. The command receiving the trained aircrews has a vested interest in supporting the
  training command's aircraft/personnel sourcing efforts. Changes in instructor requirements
  may affect manning in other areas, and therefore must be coordinated with AF/A3O-AT and
  approved by AF/A3O. (NOTE: AF/A3O-AT coordinates, in turn, with customers and
  training commands as required.) During its annual session, the AMEC Training
36                                                             AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


     Management Subgroup (ATMS) addresses any training capacity shortfalls, along with
     potential impacts and shortfall mitigation options.
        4.3.2.1. To determine the training resources needed, training commands translate Air
        Force formal flying training taskings (as documented in Program Requirements
        Document and approved syllabi) into the resources needed to provide the required
        training capacity.
        4.3.2.2. The command that provides formal training is obligated to objectively,
        efficiently, and effectively execute the PPGL. If this command has insufficient
        resources/personnel to fully execute the UPRD/GPRD, and has exhausted all options
        within its command to meet the AF's training needs, then it has two main responsibilities:
            4.3.2.2.1. Advise AF/A3O-AT, who in turn will work with the commands scheduled
            to receive the newly-trained aircrews to develop an objective under-execution
            plan. That plan will seek to direct the trained aircrews to the commands / MDSs that
            have the greatest aircrew shortages. Those commands / MDSs with healthier
            manning will typically bear the under-execution burden. However, other factors may
            bear on the situation, such as the level at which various units are being operationally
            tasked. All other factors being equal, if one command provided at least its fair
            share of support to the training command, then AF/A3O-AT would have a logical
            point for ensuring that command receives most, if not all, of its planned portion of the
            GPRD quotas.
            4.3.2.2.2. Take steps to increase training capacity to preclude future under-execution
            problems. The PRD provides multi-year training requirements to give the training
            command the opportunity to obtain the resources/personnel it will need to accomplish
            the PRD requirements. With few exceptions (such as an unforeseen extended
            strike), it should know well in advance if meeting the required UPRD/GPRD training
            will be a problem. If the training command is unable to source/fund the increased
            training capacity needed, and the lead and other commands are unable to help, then
            the training command's budget submission (in or out of cycle, as appropriate) should
            reflect the unfunded requirement. The AF corporate process (AF panels, Board,
            Council) will then take steps to rectify the training capacity shortfall, or accept the
            risks associated with an under-manned, less capable force.
     4.3.3. Training Requirements - PPBS Linkage. There is a direct and essential linkage
     between the ATDR process outlined above and the PPBS cycle which provides the funding
     for the execution of the training requirements developed during the ATDR process. The
     timeline shown in Figure 4.2 below outlines the sequence of events in the ATDR process and
     illustrates this linkage.
     4.3.4. Breaks in Training (BITs). BITs can be built-in, such as TDYs/PCSs between
     phases of training, or unintended (commonly caused by lower than planned attrition leading
     to over-production in one phase and insufficient training quotas in the next phase to
     accommodate the over-production). Built-in BITs may be needed to permit travel between
     bases, but may also be due to base training capacities and Joint training requirement.
     Commands that provide formal training are charged with continuous improvement efforts to
     minimize built-in BITs. When unintended BITs occur, potential courses of action to
     accommodate the students waiting for training are to increase training quotas (typically done
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                     37


   ―out of hide‖ [overworks instructors and reduces instructor continuation training] and results
   in MWS over-absorption [reduces combat readiness]), or to adjust future production (may
   take several years due to lead times involved, but avoids ―out of hide‖ training and over-
   absorption).
4.4. CEA and Other Non-Career Production/Training. HQ AETC ensures training pipelines
for Career Enlisted Aviators and non-career aircrew members provide progressive training for
members in these career fields. The recommended sequence is in accordance with the respective
Career Field Education and Training Plan. Personnel retraining from non-aviation specialties
into a CEA specialty start their training pipeline with the Enlisted Aircrew Undergraduate
Course (EAUC) continue through survival training, initial skills (3-level) training, and weapons
systems training. HQ AETC is responsible for ensuring completion of all prerequisite training
(through award of the 3-skill level). Once prerequisite training is completed, HQ AFPC provides
assignment instructions and schedules follow-on weapons system training.

Table 4.1. ATDR Cycle Event Sequence and Timeline and ATDR/PPBS Linkage.
The table below outlines one complete cycle of the ATDR process from the initial data call
through execution of the first year of the FYDP program covered by the data call. It illustrates
the linkage between ATDR and the PPBS cycle it is designed to support. The total elapsed time
for a single cycle is almost 4 years (for example FY 10 POM data call starts Feb 07 execution
starts Oct 09). Because this is an annual cycle tied to the PPBS, there will be three ATDR cycles
in some stage of activity at any given time.

                        AIRCREW MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS

5.1. General. Aircrew requirements are validated lieutenant colonel-and-below funded
manpower authorizations and man-year allocations for Pilots, Combat System Operators, Air
Battle Managers, and Career Enlisted Aviators. The goal is to have enough aircrew requirements
to enable the AF to perform the line and support functions directly and indirectly associated with
accomplishing the AF‘s operational flying missions on a continuous basis, as well as to meet
various institutional requirements for professional development (e.g., producing operational and
strategic level leaders for the Air Force and Joint communities). Requirements are established
based on a number of factors, including operational taskings and force structure, formal training
requirements, management staff, test, and professional development. In addition to the guidance
in this AF instruction, AFI 38-201 (Determining Manpower Requirements) and AFI 65-503 (US
Air Force Cost and Planning Factors) contain responsibilities and procedures for establishing
and justifying aircrew requirements. (NOTE: Proper terminology is important to address the
issues outlined in Chapters 5 and 6. Terms related to Chapter 5 issues are: manpower; positions;
requirements; authorizations; billets; redline; and spaces. Terms related to Chapter 6 are:
manning; inventory; bodies; blueline; and faces.)
5.2. Responsibilities. HQ USAF/A3O-AT is the focal point for and has oversight responsibility
for all lieutenant colonel-and below aircrew requirements. Regardless of how it is established
(by aircrew ratio, manpower standard, or otherwise), each aircrew manpower authorization
requires HQ USAF/A3O-AT and A1MR coordination and/or approval.
   5.2.1. As laid out in AFI 38-201, MAJCOMs are required to perform annual aircrew
   requirements reviews and report the results to HQ USAF/A3O-AT. In addition, MAJCOMs
   with Air Component roles are charged with limiting/controlling AF aircrew requirements,
   including both PCS personnel exchange program (PEP) / extended training service support
   (ETSS) billets and continuously-manned TDY slots within the area of responsibility, in
   Unified Commands; and other MAJCOMs listed below have oversight responsibility due to
   functional relationships or proximity.
                 ACC          --     Central Command; Southern Command; Strategic
Command;
                                     Joint Forces Command
                 AFSPC        --     NORTHCOM; NORAD
                 AFSOC        --     Special Operations Command
                 AMC          --     Transportation Command
                 PACAF        --     Pacific Command
                 USAFE        --     European Command; NATO; AFRICOM
                 AETC         --     Air University
   5.2.2. An AF Form 480 (Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification), or Aircrew 480 System
   electronic equivalent, is required for all Lt Col and below aircrew requirements (to include
   P/N-prefixed billets). HQ USAF/A3O-AT maintains oversight responsibility for AF Form
   480s for HAF, SAF, OSD, JCS, CoCom, FOAs/DRUs, and any other positions that do not
   fall under MAJCOM purview. HQ USAF/A3O-AT, in close coordination with the
40                                                              AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


     MAJCOMs and other 480 users, will ensure a management system is in place to effectively
     and efficiently manage the AF Form 480 program. AF/A3O-AT uses the Aircrew 480
     System to provide managerial oversight of the AF Form 480 program.
     5.2.3. Redline/Blueline -- Semiannually HQ USAF/A1PP publishes updates, in coordination
     with AF/A3O-AT and AF/A1PF, to official projections of all 11XX, 12XX, 13BX, and
     1AXXX aircrew requirements for each year throughout the FYDP. These requirement
     projections are based on the funded AF program at the time, and are the Redline portion of
     the Redline/Blueline calculations used to forecast aircrew requirements-inventory deltas.
     AF/A1PF supplies actual/forecast aircrew force inventory as reported in AFRAMS and is the
     Blueline.
5.3. Key Points. Key points regarding managing aircrew manpower requirements follow.
     5.3.1. The most important aircrew requirements are the line operational API-1/2/9/A
     positions and the training requirements necessary to sustain them. Line requirements are
     important because they define the core component (operational aircrews) of the Air Force‘s
     operational flying capability. In general, the greater the number of Active Component (AC)
     line positions, the greater the AF‘s combat/absorption/sustainability capabilities and the
     lower the OPS/PERSTEMPO. If the AF has sufficient numbers of API-1/2/9/A positions and
     the required trainers, it has the necessary flying combat capability and ability to sustain it to
     meet its flying operational taskings, and is able to do so at a reasonable OPS/PERSTEMPO.
     Similarly, it can absorb/experience enough aircrews, while maintaining unit readiness, to fill
     a reasonable number of non-flying overhead requirements. The numbers of operational API-
     1/2/9/A authorized positions are determined by the crew ratio/composition processes laid out
     in this AFI.
     5.3.2. The numbers/types of required support authorizations are dictated by how much and
     what work needs to be done. However, working within logical absorption (i.e., maintain
     force readiness) and retention (based on historical retention data) bands, aircrew shortages
     will likely exist if the size of the support (Training/Staff/Test/Non-absorbable Force) is out of
     balance with the force size (ops line positions). The vast majority of support authorizations
     (the exception being the relatively small number of FAIP authorizations) and a fair portion of
     line operational authorizations require experienced aircrew members; and, essentially the
     sole source of experienced aircrew members is the Active Duty force (operational flying
     units). In an imbalance situation, to achieve a sustainability balance necessitates: reducing
     overhead requirements by finding more efficient ways to get the work done or reducing the
     amount of overhead work; increasing line force requirements; or, a combination of both.
     5.3.3. Maintaining healthy overhead-to-line (also called blue box - to - yellow box) ratios by
     MWS and/or by MDS helps ensure aircrew force sustainability. If the overhead-to-line ratios
     are kept below 2.0, the various MDSs/MWSs are normally sustainable; i.e., the MDS/MWS
     operates efficiently (relatively small overhead) enough to enable manpower requirements to
     be fully manned.
     5.3.4. ―No Rated Staff Growth‖ Policy. Public Law 101-189 SEC. 633 states that ―No
     increase in the number of nonoperational flying duty positions in the Armed Forces (as a
     percentage of all flying duty positions in the Armed Forces) may be made after September
     30, 1992, unless the increase is specifically authorized by law.‖ This is the source document
     for the ―No Rated Staff Growth‖ policy. The AF policy is to strictly limit/control growth in
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    41


   aircrew requirements, except for that growth associated with absorbable force structure (e.g.,
   it would be acceptable to add an operational airlift squadron that can accept inexperienced
   aircrew members). This policy ensures AF compliance with Public Law. In order to
   establish a new overhead aircrew requirement, an offset of an already-existing funded
   authorization must be provided. AFI 38-201 (Ch 9) establishes the procedures for justifying
   and maintaining aircrew requirements. From an Aircrew Management perspective, this
   policy helps keep MDSs/MWSs in balance, or prevent them from getting more out of balance
   if their overhead is already too large and/or line force too small. Left unchecked, overhead
   aircrew requirements would increase to a point where rated inventory shortages become
   chronic. Tightly controlled overhead growth, using offsets, helps keep the aircrew force line
   to overhead ratio and force manning levels healthy.
   5.3.5. The requisite criterion for an aircrew authorization is that the duties of the position
   principally require aircrew expertise.
   5.3.6. The ability to fill a rated manpower authorization is not a factor in determining
   whether that rated position is needed. Requirements are established to ensure the Air Force
   mission is successfully accomplished. Ensuring appropriate rated expertise is applied to the
   requirement is a separate and distinct function. Documenting rated requirements, particularly
   during inventory shortage periods, can help make the case for increased resources necessary
   for increased absorption and proactive inventory/retention improvement initiatives.
5.4. Details. For the most part aircrew requirements are aircrew funded manpower
authorizations; they are positions listed in manpower documents and coded, categorized, and
grouped to facilitate effective tracking and management. In addition to the documented
positions, aircrew requirements include man-year adjustments to account for average annual
numbers of aircrew members in Student, Transient, or Personnel Hold (STP) status. Finally,
special duty positions (e.g., USAF Academy instructors) are institutional requirements whose
manning ideally is sourced from all AFSCs, including those of aircrews. Man-year adjustments
are also used to factor these unspecified requirements into the total aircrew requirements
calculations. The combination of aircrew manpower authorizations and man-year adjustments
enables the Air Force to accurately portray its total aircrew requirements.
   5.4.1. Aircrew Position Indicator (API) Codes and Special Experience Identifiers
   (SEIs). Each aircrew authorization must have a single-digit API code that identifies the type
   and level of flying duty or responsibility associated with that aircrew position. A complete
   listing of API Codes can be found in AFI 11-401 (Table 2.1). In addition to API codes,
   Career Enlisted Aviator career field (AFSC 1AXXX) requirements are identified by SEIs as
   listed in the Enlisted Classification Directory.
   5.4.2. Rated Categories. Rated Categories group AF aircraft to facilitate effective aircrew
   management. The Rated Categories are Fighter, Bomber, Mobility, C2ISREW, CSAR,
   Trainer, Special Ops, Unmanned, and Unspecified. In Table 5.1, aircraft designated with a
   ‗*‘ indicate absorbable aircraft (i.e., new aircrews can be assigned to those aircraft and
   become experienced in the corresponding MWS). Rated authorizations will be identified by
   Rated category to the maximum extent possible. Authorizations that can be filled by any
   MWS-/MDS-designated aircrew member are placed in the ―Unspecified‖ category.

     5.4.2.1. Specific Aircrew Requirements. Specific aircrew requirements are aircrew
     funded authorizations that require MWS-specific or aircraft-specific (also termed mission
     design series, or MDS-specific) expertise.
     5.4.2.2. Unspecified (Generalist) Requirements. Unspecified, or generalist,
     requirements are those that are not tied to a specific MWS and can be filled from the
     general inventory (e.g., 11G, pilot generalist billets, can be filled by any pilot;12G,
     navigator generalist billets, can be filled by any navigator).
  5.4.3. Aircrew Manpower Requirement Subgroups. Each aircrew category has
  subgroups that include Force, Training, Test, and Staff requirements. The Force, Training,
  and Test subgroups are further subdivided into Primary and Support areas.
     5.4.3.1. Force Manpower Requirements: Wing-and-below aircrew authorizations for
     operational flying units. In aggregate, these positions comprise the Air Force‘s aircrew
     requirements for conducting its operational flying missions.
         5.4.3.1.1. Primary: Line aircrew authorizations required for the employment of
         operational aircraft. All aircrew manpower authorizations based on aircrew
         ratios/compositions fit into this category; they have API-1/2/9/A codes.
            5.4.3.1.1.1. Aircrew Ratio/Composition (ACR/C) Processes. This section applies
            only to MAJCOMs (including ANG) with operational units; i.e., organizations
            that have units equipped with primary mission aircraft inventory (PMAI) and in a
            few cases primary other aircraft inventory (POAI), and thus have their manpower
            authorizations determined by aircrew ratios/compositions. MAJCOM/ANG
            responsibilities for coordinating, submitting, and obtaining approval of requests to
            change or establish an aircrew ratio/composition are outlined in AFI 38-201.
            MAJCOM/ANG requests must include a detailed aircrew ratio/composition
            analysis/justification that addresses both mission tasking levels and aircrew
            readiness (i.e., show that sorties/crewmember/month available will meet/exceed
            HCM/SCM required to maintain mission ready status for all line aircrew
            members). To assist with the operational analysis/justification, various aircrew
            ratio/composition considerations are outlined in paragraph 3.4.1.1.2 of this
            instruction. Once an aircrew ratio/composition has been approved by the Air
            Staff, MAJCOMs should seek funding approval through the normal budget
            process.    HQ USAF/A3O-AT incorporates approved and funded aircrew
            ratios/compositions into AFI 65-503 USAF Cost and Planning Factors Guide,
            Tables A36-1, A37-1, and A38-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition for Active,
            Reserve, and ANG forces, respectively). Additionally, ANG and AFRC are
            required to submit to AF/A3O/XPM for approval/coordination the breakout
            between Active, Technician, and Traditional Guard/Reserve authorizations and
            provide by-squadron total line aircrew authorization data.
         5.4.3.1.2. Support: Wing-and-below operational flying unit command and staff
         positions (API-3/6/B/C codes). Examples include squadron commander, squadron
         operations officer, and wing/operations group staff positions (weapons and tactics,
         stan/eval, safety, et al).
44                                                        AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


     5.4.3.2. Training Manpower Requirements: Wing-and-below aircrew authorizations
     for formal flying training units.
        5.4.3.2.1. Primary: Line aircrew instructor authorizations required for the execution
        of Program Flying Training (i.e., formal flying training, such as basic/initial, re-
        qualification, upgrade, and special mission courses); they have API-1/2/9/A codes.
        The AF uses the Flying Training Resource Analysis and Programming (FTRAP)
        system to determine how many instructors are needed for undergraduate flying
        training programs, and applies FTRAP logic to graduate training (e.g., training
        conducted at FTUs). The FTRAP system is a set of integrated resource and capacity
        models used by the commands to translate Air Force tasking (as documented in the
        Program Guidance Letter and approved syllabi) into the resources (instructors,
        aircraft, flying hours) needed to execute that tasking. The FTRAP outputs form the
        basis for POM submission and allocation/distribution of resources for these
        programs. Exception: Per international agreement, the IP requirements for the Euro-
        NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) program, including instructor training are
        determined by the ENJJPT Steering Committee and the ENJJPT Plan of Operations
        (PO). ENJJPT is a fighter/bomber program, and its USAF instructor requirements are
        considered to be Fighter/Bomber MWS authorizations. HQ AETC/A3RA determines
        requirements for instructor aircrews in undergraduate flying training (UFT) programs,
        such as Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT). HQ USAF/A3O-AT
        validates and approves the total requirements; then, after AFRC and Joint billets are
        factored out, apportions the remaining Active AF requirements among the MWSs
        based on their relative absorption levels. Included in the Active instructor
        requirements category is First Assignment IPs (FAIPs). The number of FAIP
        requirements is driven not only by operational unit requirements (i.e., to improve
        experience mix), but also by training squadron instructor mix/dynamics. Normally,
        senior AF leadership approves any significant changes to the total number of FAIP
        requirements, including their MWS breakout, at Rated Summits.
        5.4.3.2.2. Support: Wing-and-below training flying unit command and staff
        positions; they have API-3/6/B/C codes. Examples include squadron commander,
        squadron operations officer, and wing/operations group staff positions (stan/eval,
        safety, et al). Additionally, a small number of API-1/2 line flying positions are non-
        PFT justified authorizations that directly support the primary training force missions
        (e.g., T-37/38 CTP instructors, Initial Flight Screening instructors, etc.).
     5.4.3.3. Test Manpower Requirements. These are wing-and-below (or equivalent)
     aircrew authorizations for test flying units.
        5.4.3.3.1. Primary: Line aircrew authorizations required for the flight testing of
        weapon systems (e.g., aircraft, munitions, tactics); they have API-1/2/9/A/F codes.
        5.4.3.3.2. Support: Wing-and-below (or equivalent) test flying unit command and
        staff positions; they have API-3/6/B/C codes.       Examples include squadron
        commander, squadron operations officer, and wing/operations group staff positions
        (stan/eval, safety, et al).
     5.4.3.4. Staff Manpower Requirements. Staff requirements are flying and non-flying
     aircrew manpower authorizations that either directly or indirectly lead/support line
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                     45


       Force/Training/Test flying units. All Active Duty Staff aircrew authorizations are
       defined by specific manpower standards or by AF/A3O-AT-approved AF Form 480s
       (Aircrew AFSC / Active Flying Justification) in accordance with AFI 38-201.
          5.4.3.4.1. Staff. The ―staff‖ portion of these requirements technically includes all
          aircrew manpower authorizations coded as API-3/4/6/8/B/C/D/E, and therefore
          encompasses Force, Training, and Test wing-and-below command/staff billets.
          Aircrew managers are cautioned to avoid double counting wing-and-below staff
          positions since, depending on the analysis, some API-3/6 slots can be included as part
          of Force/Training/Test or part of the Staff category. Frequently, ―Staff‖ is used to
          refer to only those API-3/4/6/8/B/C/D/E positions outside/above the operational wing
          level.
          5.4.3.4.2. Positions with P/N-prefixed Non-rated AFSCs. By definition, non-career
          positions do not require rated expertise (e.g., aeronautical engineer billets); however,
          some would require rated knowledge/background. In accordance with AFOCD, HQ
          USAF/A3O-AT may authorize ―P‖ (pilot required) or ―N‖ (CSO/ABM required)
          prefixes in these cases. P/N-prefix positions are considered rated requirements.
   5.4.4. Aircrew Man-year Requirements. In addition to specific aircrew funded manpower
   authorizations, man-year requirements are determined to account for the average annual
   number of aircrew members in advanced student (i.e., aircrew members TDY to units for
   ETCA formal flying training), PCS development education (e.g., IDE and SDE), transient
   (leave/travel between PCS moves), prisoner, or patient status. HQ USAF/A3O-AT works
   with HQ USAF/A1M/A1P, AFPC, and MAJCOM counterparts to determine the man-year
   allocations, including breakout by MWS.
   5.4.5. Special Duty Identifier and Reporting Identifier Positions. To fully capture the
   AF‘s aircrew needs, AF/A3O-AT factors unspecified requirements into the total aircrew
   requirements calculations. In instances where unspecified positions have been coded with a
   ―P‖ or ―N‖ prefix approved by AF/A3O-AT, these billets are included in the aircrew
   manpower authorizations category.
5.5. CEAs and Non-rated Aircrew Member Authorizations. All non-CEA enlisted and some
officer aircrew positions are non-rated. Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) authorizations are
aircrew member positions coded with a 1AXXX AFSC. Non-rated, non-CEA aircrew positions
are identified by an 'X' prefix such as X1NXXX (Intel), X4N0X1 (Aero Med), X3V0XX (Visual
Info), X14N (Officer Intel) and X33S (Info Sys), X46F (Flight Nurse). Non-rated aircrew
member positions are identified by API 0 (officer) and API Z (enlisted). New nonrated officer
requests are submitted through MAJCOM channels with justification on AF Form 480s for A3O-
AT approval IAW AFI 11-402. All MWS earned aircrew (including non-rated enlisted/officer)
crew ratios/compositions are outlined in AFI 65-503.
   5.5.1. Enlisted Aircrew Grade Structure. To ensure consistent and standardized management
   of CEA members throughout the Air Force, HQ USAF/A3O-AT, in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A1M counterparts and MAJCOMs, establishes authorized grade structure allocations
   for the 1AXXX specialty. Adherence to these allocations is essential to effectively project
   required accessions and align personnel with the crew ratio-gained force structure. Changes
   to enlisted aircrew grade structure allocations must be coordinated with the CEA career field
   manager in HQ USAF/A3O-AT. HQ USAF/A1PF and HQ AFPC/DPAA/DPAOM4 provide
46                                                          AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


     information to MFMs, through MAJCOM/A1 counterparts, concerning the status of CEAs,
     including, but not limited to: manning, distribution by grade, and retention rates. HQ
     USAF/A3O-AT will use this information, coupled with historical data, to assess current and
     projected requirements.
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    47

                   RETENTION, INVENTORY, AND DEVELOPMENT

6.1. Retention. Like absorption, retention affects virtually every aspect of aircrew management.
The AF retention goal is to facilitate aircrew force sustainability (continuously having the
numbers and types [i.e., by MDS/MWS and experience/qualification] of aircrews required to
match aircrew requirements) by means of sound aircrew management practices (i.e., matching
force structure with tasking levels and achieving readiness parameters both optimize retention)
along with consistent, credible, long-term-focused personnel policies and actions. (NOTE:
Proper terminology is important to address the issues outlined in Chapters 5 and 6. Terms
related to Chapter 5 issues are: manpower; positions; requirements; authorizations; billets;
redline; and spaces. Terms related to Chapter 6 are: manning; inventory; bodies; blueline; and
faces.).
   6.1.1. Retention Considerations.
       6.1.1.1. The economy, particularly the aviation industry for pilots, has historically been
       the primary determinant of aircrew retention, and the AF has limited influence on this
       external factor. If the economy is strong, AF retention usually suffers, and vice versa.
       Aviator Continuation Pay (i.e., Bonuses), can lessen, but not eliminate, the economy‘s
       effect on retention.
       6.1.1.2. While direct analytical correlations have been problematic, exit surveys have
       shown that high OPS/PERSTEMPO can negatively affect retention. Additionally, a
       high OPS/PERSTEMPO across the Total Force negatively affects the ARC‘s ability to
       recruit personnel leaving the active duty component.
       6.1.1.3. Turbulence that can result from unpredictable and short-notice taskings, is
       another potentially adverse retention factor in the OPS/PERSTEMPO area.
       6.1.1.4. Erosion of pay/benefits (especially health care) can have an adverse impact on
       retention.
   6.1.2. Retention Options. Retaining aircrews the AF has trained and experienced is much
   more effective, efficient, and responsive than replacing them, since replacement requires
   substantial time and money to access, train, and experience new aircrews. Options for
   improvement include:
       6.1.2.1. Establishing/maintaining longer Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSCs)
       for initial training.
       6.1.2.2. Increasing compensation -- Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Aviator
       Continuation Pay (ACP), Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), retirement/health
       benefits, etc.
       6.1.2.3. Improving/maintaining Quality of Life -- maintaining readiness, reducing
       OPS/PERSTEMPO, increasing tasking stability/predictability (minimize short/no-notice
       taskings; optimize unit rhythm) improving family support (living facilities, health care,
       etc.).
       6.1.2.4. Selective continuation of deferred aircrew members.
48                                                             AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


        6.1.2.5. Allowing limited number of active component personnel to move to reserve
        component units via Palace Chase (provided operational flying/mission readiness is
        maintained).
        6.1.2.6. Though not a long-term retention option, the use of Stop Loss has historically
        had a negative impact on retention dynamics for aircrews. Although it helps in the short
        term, a Stop Loss program adversely impacts QoL and therefore hurts long-term retention
        in the aircrew community.
     6.1.3. Promotions. Competitive aircrew promotion rates are an essential ingredient of
     successful retention. The HQ USAF/A3O-AT aircrew career field managers (CFMs), along
     with HQ USAF/A1PP and MAJCOM aircrew managers, are responsible for considering
     potential promotion implications in analyzing aircrew management policy
     recommendations/decisions, which typically have MDS/MWS-wide and/or AF-wide effects.
     For instance, if an MDS over-absorbs new aircrews, its operational units become
     overmanned. If not accompanied by increased flying hours, this overmanning reduces unit
     readiness/capability due to low HCM/SCM, and can erode individual flying skills. This can
     result in poor flying performance (e.g., check rides) that could adversely affect his/her
     OPRs/PRFs/EPRs. If severe overmanning persists, aircrew members are less likely to
     upgrade (e.g., to aircraft commander, flight lead, instructor) than their peers in other MDSs
     that are properly manned. In extreme cases, some aircrews may actually be reassigned from
     their first operational assignment without becoming experienced; the downstream impact can
     be reduced job/promotion opportunities (e.g., flight commander billets).
     6.1.4. TARS and CCR. Two common retention measures are cumulative continuation rate
     (CCR) and Total Active Rated Service (TARS). CCR measures retention of year groups
     (e.g., 6-11, 6-14 years) near initial ADSC completion. TARS looks at retention for all Lt Col
     and below year groups (1-28 years). TARS and CCR are historical, not predictive, metrics.
     However, TARS can be used to make simplified inventory projections. HQ AFPC computes
     current and retains historical AF retention data. See Attachments 2 and 3 for definitions and
     equations.
        6.1.4.1. Total Active Rated Service (TARS). TARS is an expression in years, of the
        average number of years an officer serves in the rated force, from award of rating to
        separation, promotion to colonel, grounding or retirement based on current retention
        percentages. HQ AFPC/DPAPA calculates the historical TARS and publishes it in the
        annual Rated Officer Retention Analysis Report. The greater the retention, the higher the
        TARS.
        6.1.4.2. Cumulative Continuation Rate (CCR). CCR is the percentage of rated
        officers who remain in service after a given period of time. The two most common views
        are 6-11 years and 6-14 years. A CCR of 60% for 6-14 years means that 60% of the rated
        officers entering their sixth year of service are expected to remain in service through their
        fourteenth year, assuming current retention patterns continue. The higher the retention,
        the higher the CCR.
6.2. Aircrew Inventory. Aircrew Inventory is defined by career field category (Pilot, CSO,
ABM, CEA) as the number of Lt Col-and-below (and SMSgt-and-below) qualified aircrew
members in the USAF. For inventory purposes, an aircrew member is considered "qualified"
when he/she completes initial/basic flight training and is awarded their rating. For example, an
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    49


individual is counted in the pilot inventory when he/she graduates from SUPT and is awarded an
aeronautical pilot rating IAW AFIs 11-401 and 11-402. Aircrew members continue to be counted
as inventory for as long as they retain an aircrew rating. Permanently disqualified aircrew (to
include ASC 02) are not part of the official aircrew inventory for accounting purposes; however,
they may continue to be employed in non-flying rated positions dependent upon AF needs.
   6.2.1. Inventory Considerations. Having sufficient aircrew inventory is essential to AF
   combat capability/readiness, training, and management of our aircrew force to ensure
   mission accomplishment. The HQ USAF/A3O-AT aircrew career field managers have lead
   responsibility for aircrew requirements and overall aircrew management. HQ USAF/A1PP is
   the OPR for aircrew-related personnel policies that work in conjunction with A3O-AT‘s
   aircrew management policies.
   6.2.2. Inventory Calculations. HQ USAF/A1PF uses the AFRAMS model to provide
   official total Active aircrew inventory projections, as well as projections for Active aircrew
   inventory by MWS. Simplified calculations that are sometimes used to do inventory
   projection excursions are the following:
       6.2.2.1. Total Active Inventory = Total Active Annual Production X Active TARS
(Example: 1100 pilots/yr produced X 12.0 yrs TARS = 13,200 Total Active Pilots)
       6.2.2.2. MWS Active Inventory = MWS Active Annual Absorption X Active MWS
       TARS
(Example: 330 fighter pilots/yr absorbed X 13 yrs TARS = 4,290 Active Fighter Pilots)


                            Simplified Calculation CAUTIONS:
       6.2.2.3. Typical excursions involve varying production/absorption while keeping TARS
       constant. However, varying production/absorption requires that TARS be adjusted,
       because changing production/absorption affects retention.
(Example: 270 FTR pilots/yr absorbed X 14.4 yrs TARS = 3,888 FTR pilots
          300 FTR pilots/yr absorbed X 13.0 yrs TARS = 3,900 FTR pilots
           330 FTR pilots/yr absorbed X 11.6 yrs TARS = 3,828 FTR pilots)
       6.2.2.4. These calculations assume steady-state production/absorption and retention for a
       28-year period (i.e., TARS span of time). Due to changes in production/absorption
       capacity and in the economy, historical data shows that both production/absorption and
       TARS vary from year to year.
   6.2.3. Inventory Management. HQ USAF/A3O-AT is responsible for aircrew management
   guidance, which is implemented to some extent via personnel policies and accounting
   practices throughout the various phases of the aircrew life cycle, including:
       6.2.3.1. Accessions Policy OPR: HQ USAF/A1P (levels provided by HQ USAF/A3O-
       AT).
       6.2.3.2. Assignment, Joint Officer Management, and Classification Policy OPR: HQ
       USAF/A1PPA.
       6.2.3.3. Promotions and Evaluations Policy OPR: HQ USAF/A1PPP.
50                                                             AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


        6.2.3.4. Development Policy OPR: HQ USAF/A1D.
        6.2.3.5. Retirements and Separations Policy OPR: HQ USAF/A1PPS.
        6.2.3.6. Inventory Data. HQ AFPC/DPAP, in coordination with HQ USAF/A1PF,
        provides official aircrew inventory data, which includes, but is not limited to, manning,
        distribution by grade or year group, and gate months completed. HQ AFPC/DPAP also
        measures and provides current and historical information concerning aircrew retention to
        HQ USAF A/3/5 and HQ USAF/A1 upon request.
     6.2.4. Rated Distribution and Training Management (RDTM) Codes. Rated officers are
     uniquely identified by their RDTM Code (Table 6.2) for the purposes of inventory
     management. RDTM Codes are assigned to each MDS within an MWS. The RDTM Code
     will reflect the crewmember‘s appropriate MWS, but does not imply the member is actively
     flying or maintaining currency in that aircraft. Pilots and navigators who most recently
     completed training in a trainer aircraft (an aircraft associated with the trainer RDTM Code)
     but who earlier were identified with another MWS category code will retain their previous
     code. Only pilots assigned to a training aircraft and not earlier awarded another MWS
     category code will be identified by the trainer RDTM Code (e.g., FAIPs). HQ AFPC/DPAO
     is OPR for the RDTM codes.
     6.2.5. Unique Qualifications. Aircrew members may also be identified by unique
     qualifications or codes. Examples of such identifiers include grade, currency, qualification,
     year group, Special Experience Identifier (SEI), and completed Operational Flying Duty
     Accumulator (OFDA) gates.
6.3. Development. Development of aircrews is vitally important. This ensures both near term
occupational needs and longer-term needs, such as leadership, are met. Development tools
generally fall into the following categories: education, training, and assignments. Development
may be provided by the Air Force or it may be self-developed.
     6.3.1. Assignments. Aircrew management guidance and other assignment policies drive
     aircrew assignments.
        6.3.1.1. Readiness Parameters: AF senior leadership has established MDS readiness
        parameters – unit experience mix, average time on station, and manning level objectives
        – that significantly influence assignments, because AFPC is required to manage
        assignments so as to achieve the AF-approved readiness parameter objectives. In making
        each aircrew assignment AFPC must consider the effect on readiness parameters.
        6.3.1.2. Aircrews in Aircrew Manpower Authorizations. AFI 38-201 Manpower and
        Organization – Management of Manpower Requirements and Authorizations requires
        that a rated AFSC only be designated for ―positions with duties clearly requiring rated
        skills,‖, and AFI 36-2110 Assignments requires that Rated officers ―…are assigned
        primarily to fill rated requirements‖. Air Force policy is that rated officers should not be
        assigned to non-rated billets. Exceptions to this policy are permitted when the
        assignment is determined to be in the best interests of the Air Force.
        6.3.1.3. Assignment Guidance. Assignment of temporary or permanently disqualified
        rated personnel to non-flying rated positions closely associated with active flying (e.g.,
        ALO) will be on a case-by-case basis according to AFI 36-2110.
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  51


        6.3.1.3.1. First Assignment Instructor Pilots (FAIPs). CSAF policy is that FAIP
        tours will be no longer than pilot instructor training (PIT) plus three years, at which
        time the FAIP will be assigned to a MWS. Specific MWS determination/assignment
        is made after observing FAIP performance for approximately two years. FAIPS will
        be given highest priority for MWS training three years after completion of PIT.
        6.3.1.3.2. Service Liaison Officers. Service liaison officer billets (e.g., Air Liaison
        Officer (ALO), Air Mobility Liaison Officer (AMLO), etc.) will be filled as
        prescribed in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Air Force and
        other Services.
           6.3.1.3.2.1. Air Liaison Officers (ALOs). Air Liaison Officers (ALOs). ALO
           billets will be filled by designated officers IAW allocation plans (e.g., fighter
           pilots and weapons system officers; bomber pilots and navigators; ABMs;
           electronic warfare officers (EWOs); Special Tactics Officers (STOs)). The goal is
           to fill no less than 50% of the unit level ALO billets with fighter crewmembers
           and no less than 55% of the ALO billets Air Force-wide with fighter
           crewmembers.
           6.3.1.3.2.2. Air Mobility Liaison Officers (AMLOs). AMLO billets should be
           filled IAW Allocation Plans by mobility (tanker/airlift) aircrew members.
        6.3.1.3.3. Total Force Absorption Program (TFAP) Aircrews. An initiative to
        help sustain total requirements by training and experiencing limited numbers of
        Active Duty (AD) inexperienced (INEX) and limited experienced (LIMEX) aircrews
        in Air Reserve Component (ARC) operational flying units. TFAP was implemented
        by AF/XO in Jan ‘02 with goal of reducing AD unit overmanning and ARC unit
        under-manning, while continuing to optimize Total Force absorption of AD pilots.
        6.3.1.3.4. Fighter Associate Program (FAP). FAP was instituted to replace the
        fighter portion of the Total Force Absorption Program (TFAP) and all provisions of
        the TFAP Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for existing limited experience
        (LIMEX) TFAP fighter pilots assigned to AFRC units. The program is administered
        via a MOU between COMACC and AFRC/CC. (NOTE: FAP will be phased out as
        TFI Active and Reserve Associate programs are stood up.)
        6.3.1.3.5. Flight Surgeons, Pilot-Physicians, and Exchange Officers. Total
        number of active (i.e., API-5) Air Force Flight Surgeons can not exceed one flight
        surgeon per crew position per squadron and will be assigned as determined by
        AFMOA guidance. No more than one exchange officer per aircrew career field (e.g.,
        pilot, nav/EWO, ABM) is authorized per operational flying squadron, and no more
        than two exchange officers per career field per training squadron are authorized.
        SAF/IA maintains the CSAF-approved listing of the units and level of participation in
        the exchange program. Any change to the exchange program list requires AF/A3O
        coordination/approval.    Any changes to the flight surgeon and pilot-physician
        assignment policies require AF/A3O and AF/SG3P coordination/approval (see AFI
        11-405 The Pilot-Physician Program for detailed guidance on Pilot-Physicians).
     6.3.1.4. Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) Management. To facilitate healthy CEA
     manning among all 1AXXX AFSCs, when in the best interests of the Air Force, the Air
52                                                           AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


        Force has the option to crossflow CEAs laterally into another CEA AFSC in cases where
        similar skills would facilitate such a transition (e.g., from 1A0 to 1A2 and vice versa).
        Any projected assignment action along these lines requires coordination between HQ
        USAF/DPE (Chief‘s Group), HQ AFPC/DPAOM4, HQ AF/A3O-AT (CEA Career Field
        Manager), and MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs). Training availability, OFDA
        Gate Credit, Controlled Duty Assignment (CDA), and associated ADSCs are important
        considerations in managing this process. For Guard and Reserve, approval authority for
        CEA Crossflow is NGB/A3 and AFRC/A2/3, respectively.
            6.3.1.4.1. Criteria for release to Special Duty Identifier (SDI) or Reporting
            Identifier (RI) tours:
               6.3.1.4.1.1. Must have completed 1st OFDA Gate IAW FY00 NDAA and AFI
               11-401.
               6.3.1.4.1.2. Must be able to meet 2nd and/or 3rd Gate upon completion of SDI/RI
               tour.
               6.3.1.4.1.3. Must not be on a Controlled Duty Assignment (CDA).
               6.3.1.4.1.4. Must not be drawing an SRB or AFSC on the Chronic Critical Skills

     6.3.2. Other development tools. Other development tools are education and training. They
     may be provided by the Air Force or they may be self-developed. Generally these tools
     promote occupational or institutional competencies. It is important that aircrew members be
     developed for leadership positions as well as for aircrew requirements. Proper development
     will ensure upward mobility for aircrew members which should lead to appropriate
     promotion opportunities and enhance retention.

         AIRCREW REQUIREMENTS-INVENTORY DELTA MANAGEMENT

7.1. Overview. The AF goal is to consistently match aircrew inventory and requirements; i.e.,
at a minimum, have the right numbers and types (e.g., mission qualified, experienced, instructor)
of aircrews to man all aircrew positions while also taking into account man-year requirements.
This chapter outlines the methods and approaches for forecasting aircrew shortages/overages,
and for avoiding, correcting, and/or mitigating them. When working to eliminate requirements-
inventory deltas, past lessons substantiate the importance of making smooth, incremental MWS-
specific adjustments over time vice major, non-specific corrections.
7.2. Redline/Blueline (RL/BL) Charts: Requirements-Inventory Delta Forecasts. Charts
that depict requirements and inventory data use red lines for requirements and blue lines for
inventory; they are referred to as ―Redline/Blueline‖ charts. RL/BL charts are the official
aircrew requirements-inventory projections; they are prepared semiannually by HQ
USAF/A1PPR. AF/A1PF provides the Blueline data and AF/A3O-ATA provides the Redline
data. RL/BL charts are made available to senior AF leaders and MAJCOM/A3/A1 Aircrew
Managers for their use in conjunction with readiness and other data to make informed aircrew
management decisions. While RL/BL charts for an entire career field provide aggregate data,
MDS/MWS-specific RL/BL solutions are critical for effectively rectifying aircrew
shortages/overages. MDS/MWS-specific solutions help match inventory and requirements.
   7.2.1. Redline Requirements. The Redline includes all Lt Col-and-below aircrew
   manpower authorizations, as well as man-year allocations (e.g., for advanced students, PME,
   etc.).
   7.2.2. Blueline Inventory. The Blueline inventory includes all Lt Col-and-below qualified
   aircrew members. It does not include medically disqualified aircrews unless they retain an
   aircrew rating (e.g., UAV pilot).
7.3. Reduce/Eliminate Aircrew Shortfalls. The preferred methods for reducing/eliminating
aircrew shortfalls are to:
   7.3.1. Improve Retention (See Chapter 6 for improvement options.) Retaining the aircrews
   the AF has trained and experienced is much more effective, efficient, and responsive than
   replacing them, since replacement requires substantial time and money to access, train, and
   experience new aircrews. However, retention improvement has its limits. If the force
   structure (line API-1/2/9/A positions) is undersized in relation to the size of the inventory,
   experienced aircrews will likely encounter limited opportunities to return to fly to update
   flying credentials and attain mandated flying gates.
   7.3.2. Reduce Support Requirements. Note that this option is limited to support
   requirements; deleting line operational requirements will reduce absorption capability, and
   thus result in an increased inventory shortfall. Care should be taken when reducing support
   requirements to consider the impact on developmental goals. Options include:
       7.3.2.1. Delete obsolete requirements. Annual MAJCOM and Air Staff aircrew
       requirements reviews directed by AFI 38-201 are intended to help ensure outdated
       requirements are deleted. Obsolete staff requirements can be used as ‗offsets‘ for new
58                                                            AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


        staff requirements. AF/A3O-AT should be consulted prior to completely deleting a staff
        requirement.
        7.3.2.2. Find more effective and/or efficient ways to do business -- consolidate overhead
        organizational structure laterally or vertically, automate operations, and so on. If line
        operational positions are eliminated for budgetary or other reasons, a reduction in
        overhead requirements is necessary to maintain a healthy overhead-to-line requirements
        balance. However, such cuts can become problematic in cases where certain overhead
        functions (e.g., Test) are needed regardless of the number of operational squadrons being
        supported.
        7.3.2.3. Convert Active positions to Reserve Component (RC) or civilian positions. Any
        conversions to RC positions should be a collaborative effort with the respective
        Components and due consideration for limiting factors (e.g., end strength caps). If
        Active positions are converted to RC, they should be done so on a temporary basis (e.g.,
        within the FYDP) and be reverted back to Active downstream. Permanent government
        civilian positions can bring stability and corporate/institutional knowledge to an
        organization. However, the caution for conversions to civilian positions in support/staff
        areas is to make sure the organization continues to have some Active slots to retain the
        potential for the presence of personnel with recent field/operational experience and to
        provide Force Development opportunities. As an alternative to converting, consider
        Limited Extended Active Duty (LEAD) tours, temporary AGRs, and bringing IMAs onto
        MPA tours in multiple-month increments.
     7.3.3. Increase Absorption Capability (i.e., increase flying hours and training resources).
     7.3.4. Use Alternate Staff Manning. Make use of all available alternate sources of military
     aircrew expertise where practical. Options include voluntary retired recall program,
     voluntary limited period recall program, and government civilian temporary over-hire.
     These, either by law or by design, should be temporary options that afford the Air Force the
     flexibility to increase/decrease them as Active requirements-inventory deltas change. Other
     alternate manning options include use of other aircrew members in non-flying staff positions
     where shortages exist (e.g., CEA‘s in certain AOC positions). Still other manning options
     include converting non-flying staff positions to civilian positions and hiring civilian
     contractors with appropriate experience. Flying positions, especially Force and Training
     slots, should be manned by Active/Reserve Component personnel to optimize the Air Force‘s
     drawdown/surge and training capabilities.
7.4. Common Missteps. The two most common missteps in seeking to balance inventory and
requirements are:
     7.4.1. Excessively over-absorbing new aircrews without funding necessary resources to
     maintain combat capability/readiness.
     7.4.2. Cut line operational positions -- reduces requirements, but also reduces absorption
     capability, and therefore inventory, such that the net effect is typically an increase in the
     delta.
7.5. Rated Allocation Plans. AF/A3O-AT, in coordination with AF/A1PP, prepares rated
allocation plans that man organizations in accordance with priorities set by senior AF leadership.
Allocation plans are intended to provide a disciplined, objective approach for the Air Force to
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   59


bear aircrew shortfalls in areas where they can be best mitigated. When practical, Rated
Allocation Plans should balance near-term operational needs with long-term leadership needs.
Historically, the Air Force‘s priorities have been to man Force and Training requirements at the
100% level and place any over-/under-manning burdens in the Test/Staff/Other areas. The
detrimental effects of under-manning the Force are discussed in Chapter 3. Under-manning
Force/Training units could not only reduce combat and absorption capabilities, but also hurt
retention. Under-manning Staff units could not only reduce capabilities, but it also could hurt
the ability to develop leaders with the breadth and depth of experience required at the most
senior levels inside and outside the Air Force. As has been the case with allocation plans for
shortages, allocation plans for overages have traditionally manned Force/Training at 100% while
placing the overages in Staff/Other/Test and special duty positions. An overage plan helps
ensure a disciplined management approach is maintained for aircrews, and also facilitates
minimizing any negative effects on other career fields that could result from assigning rated
personnel to non-rated management positions. Rated Allocation Plans are normally published
after RL/BL updates.
   7.5.1. Guidance and Procedures. AF leadership approves aircrew manning priorities at
   four-star meetings, such as CORONAs and Rated Summits. AF/A3O is responsible for
   developing the process for coordinating and implementing allocation plans, and is the Air
   Force focal point for submitting any proposed changes in aircrew manning priorities to
   CSAF for approval. AF/A3O-AT serves as the ―honest broker‖ for allocation plans.
   7.5.2. Rated Priorities. Air Force Rated priorities are reflected in periodic updates via the
   Rated Staff Allocation Plan (RSAP). AF/A3O-AT, in coordination with AF/A1PP, develops
   the RSAP for CSAF approval. Applying the tenets of equity, flexibility, responsiveness, and
   visibility in its construction, the RSAP provides organizations with ‗Entitlements‘, against
   which AFPC/DPA assigns the available Rated inventory. AFPC/DPA ensures visibility by
   periodically publishing the goal vs. execution metrics of the RSAP.
7.6. CEA Priorities. Air Force CEA priorities provide for equitable distribution of all
resources. This ensures each weapons system shares in any production constraints. CEA
resources are distributed based solely on validated requirements. Unless directed otherwise by
CEA Career Field Manager, the CEA priorities are as follows:
       Operational Line Units           100% or worldwide average (whichever is less)
       Training Units                   100% or worldwide average (whichever is less)
       Overseas Units                   Worldwide average
       MAJCOM Level Stan/Eval positions,
       Staff, Test, SDI/RI and Other    Based on MWS manning
       CEA CFM                          IAW CEA CFM Prioritization Plan
7.7. Forms Adopted. AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.

Terms:
Absorption: Absorption is the process of gaining new undergraduate flying training (UFT)
graduates and/or prior qualified (e.g., FAIP, OSA) aircrews, by career field (i.e., Pilot;
CSO/Nav/EWO/WSO; ABM; CEA) into operational unit line flying positions (i.e., API—
1/2/9/A) for their first operational assignment. Numerically, it is the total number of
inexperienced aviators that ops units can take in each year and maintain the appropriate
experience mix, maintain combat capability, and develop/age the new aviator in a timely manner.
Absorbable Unit:—A flying unit that accepts inexperienced aircrew members into its crew
force. Table 5.1 of this AFI annotates absorbable aircraft.
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                      63


Active Component (AC):—Active Duty forces.
Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM):—Individuals appointed by Air Staff DCS‘s to
manage education, training, and resources for a specific career field(s).
Air Reserve Component (ARC):—the combination of both AF Reserve Command (AFRC) and
Air National Guard (ANG) forces.
Aircrew Fundamentals Course (AFC): A screening course implemented for enlisted
aircrew candidates to reduce attrition in expensive follow—on weapons systems training.
Also prepares volunteer aircrew candidates for specific aviation career fields. The course is the
only point in training where pipeline students may self-eliminate from aviation service without
prejudice.
Aircrew Evaluation Board (AEB): An administrative, fact—finding proceeding designed to
ensure the quality control of the CEA, non-rated officer or non-CEA aircrew force. A board
consists of officers (rated and non-rated) and NCOs who are qualified for aviation service and
are serving in an active ASC. Board members examine a crewmembers professional
qualification for aviation service, evaluate potential for use in future aviation duties, and make
recommendations to higher authorities.
Aircrew Management Document (AMD): Document normally published annually that
summarizes decisions of the AMEC and other aircrew management—related
guidance/taskings/information/briefings since the previous AMEC. Also include the
Redline/Blueline, current distribution, and requirements data.
Aircrew Management Executive Council (AMEC): Aircrew Managers (O—6 and below).
Key forum for Air Staff and MAJCOMs to discuss and review policy and plans. AMEC replaces
the Rated Management Executive Council (RMEC) and the Enlisted Aircrew Management
Council (EAMC).
Aircrew Position Indicator (API): Formerly Rated Position Indicator (RPI). Single digit
code that identifies the type and level of flying duty or responsibility associated with a
rated/CEA authorization. All non—aircrew authorizations have default values of ‗0‘ (officers)
and ‗Z‘ (enlisted).
ALFA:—an acronym that stands for ALO, LIFT, FAC, and ATC. Though the origin dates to
the Vietnam era, the term 'ALFA Tour' is still used to describe assignments that are "bills" to pay
by the operational flying community (i.e., manned by Experienced Aviators).
Allocations:—For the purpose of this AFI only, the rated inventory provided to each
MAJCOM/FOA to fill its authorizations, as determined by the Rated Staff Allocation Plan. In
this context, the term allocations and entitlements are used interchangeably.
Authorizations:—A funded manpower requirement with detail that defines the position in terms
of its function, organization, location, skill, grade, and other appropriate characteristics that
commands use to extend end strength manpower resources to their units. The Manpower
Programming and Execution System (MPES) is the system of record documenting AF manpower
requirements. AF/A3O-AT extracts rated requirements and is OPR for crew ratio changes and
approval authority for all non-manpower-determined rated positions. Files are updated monthly
and extracts of end fiscal year authorizations are used for planning purposes.

Average Time on Station:—The average tour length (e.g., 2.95 years) for operational (Force)
line aircrew members; calculated for each aircrew category (e.g., pilot, ABM, etc).
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP):—Incentive pay (an entitlement pay) for rated officers
in an aviation career as authorized in the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974 and the Aviation
Career Improvement Act of 1989.
Aviator Continuation Pay (ACP):—Retention bonus (NOT an entitlement pay) offered to
eligible rated officers as an incentive to voluntarily extend their active duty service commitment
in exchange for bonus payments in accordance with executing a valid agreement. ACP programs
must be proposed and approved each fiscal year by SAF/MR and each fiscal year‘s program is
―stand -alone‖ by design and by law.
Awaiting PCS Training (APT) Pool:—The pool of UFT candidates who are waiting for a
training slot/quota to begin formal flying training
Blocked Cockpits:—Line unit authorizations not available for absorption in order to
accommodate pilots/CSOs/ABMs with previous MWS experience returning to flying; or
pilots/navigators/ABMs who left their MWS before becoming experienced and/or upgrading to
aircraft commander.
Blue Box:—Overhead (Training/Staff/Test/Other) API -1/2/3/4/6/8/9/A/B/C positions that
require experienced aircrews.
Budget Categories:—Rated requirements are expressed in the budget categories of force,
training, staff, pipeline, transients and AFIT/PME. Rated inventory allocation plans and
supporting management products are constructed to align with this budget format.
Career Enlisted Aviators Career Field (AFSCs 1AXXX):—Career field encompassing
functions of program formulating, policy planning, inspecting, training and directing, and
performing combat operations pertinent to enlisted primary aircrew activities. Encompasses the
primary aviation enlisted AFSCs 1A0XX through 1A8XX.
Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP):—Incentive pay for career enlisted flyers;
authorized under U.S. Code Title 37.
Cumulative Continuation Rates (CCR):—CCRs represent the product of multiple year
retention rates. CCR is normally calculated using the 6 to 11 year groups (or 6 to 14) and
represents an estimate of the percentage of officers entering their sixth year of service who, given
current retention patterns, are expected to remain in the service through their 11th year.
Continuation rates may also be used to assess the expected average service that is associated with
a loss rate pattern. This computation yields our expected man-years of service. Data may be
computed for either Total Active Rated Service (TARS) or Total Active Federal Commissioned
Service (TAFCS).
Delayed Entry:—For purposes of this instruction only, a program to bring newly commissioned
officers, who are destined for UFT, on active duty in non -flying duties for a limited period of
time.
Distributed Mission Operations (DMO):—An Air Force readiness effort. It is not a single
program, but a federate of integrated, complimentary training domains. Each domain is focused
on a specific set of warfighters and the Air Force mission essential capabilities and tasks they
perform. DMO provides the warfighter with the potential to expand the usefulness of training
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                      65


systems by making available individual training, inter and intra -team training, and mission
rehearsal scenarios. DMO utilizes advanced mission simulators, L-V-C simulations, and real-
world systems networked together to form a distributed synthetic battlefield.
Distributed Mission Training (DMT):—Utilizes advanced mission simulators, L -V-C
simulations, and real-world scenarios to form a distributed synthetic battlefield. DMT provides a
specific set of warfighter training scenarios that focus on individual, team and inter-team mission
essential competencies.
Distribution:—For purposes of this instruction only, AF/A3O -approved guidance published by
HQ USAF/A3O-AT which aligns the numbers of aircrew inputs to MWS training, including
UFT graduates, and OSA/FAIP return assignments. MAJCOMs project openings, training
capacity, and pipeline absorption requirements, all of which contribute to periodic distribution
updates.
Entitlement:—See Allocation.
Experience:—A measure of a unit‘s flying maturity which is a primary factor in determining
overall unit readiness. Experience is comprised of two parts: 1) Criterion --minimum level of
flying time and/or time in crew position, which a crew member must have in order to be
―experienced.‖ 2) Objective--minimum number of crew ratio-earned unit authorizations which
must be occupied by experienced crewmembers in order to meet readiness constraints. (Based
on 100% manning and is normally expressed as a percentage.)
First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP):—A new SUPT graduate whose first assignment is
as an SUPT instructor.
Flight Evaluation Board (FEB):—An administrative, fact -finding proceeding designed to
ensure the quality control of the rated force. A board consists of rated officers who are qualified
for aviation service and are serving in an active ASC. Board members examine a rated officer's
professional qualification for aviation service, evaluate potential for use in future rated duties,
and make recommendations to higher authorities.
Flight Lead (FL):—Pilot qualified to lead a flight (2 or more aircraft).
Flying Training CONOPS:—The process which tied validated training requirements to the Air
Force Programming, Planning, and Budgeting System (PPBS). Replaced by Aircrew Training &
Distribution Requirements (ATDR) Process (see Chapter 4 of this AFI for details).
Flying Training Resource Analysis and Programming (FTRAP) System:—A set of
integrated resource and capacity models used to translate Air Force formal flying training
taskings (as documented in Program Requirements Documents and approved syllabi) into the
resources needed to execute that tasking. The principal outputs of the system are flying hour
requirements, aircraft requirements, and instructor requirements for undergraduate pilot training
and instructor training courses. The models in FTRAP calculate capacity for each base/aircraft,
distribute the production tasking among the bases, and then calculate the resources required by
base/aircraft. The FTRAP system is also used to help analyze FTU and other aircrew training
requirements.
Formal Training Unit (FTU):—a permanent flying unit whose dedicated mission is to provide
formal syllabus training at the graduate level using Training (TF) coded assets.

Functional Manager:—For aircrew management purposes, individuals appointed by
MAJCOM/DOs to manage education, training, and resources for aircrew career fields for that
MAJCOM. From a wider AF viewpoint, functional managers are designated at the Air Staff for
all AFSCs. For example, the Air Force pilot, navigator/EWO, ABM, and CEA career field
managers reside in HQ USAF/A3O -AT.
Generalist Aircrew Requirements:—Aircrew authorizations that are not tied to a specific
MWS and can be filled from the general inventory (e.g., 11G, pilot generalist billets, can be
filled by any pilot, and 12G, navigator generalist billets, can be filled by any navigator).
Generalist authorizations have also been referred to as ―unspecified requirements.‖
Graduate Programmed Requirements Document (GPRD):—reflects specific MAJCOM
graduate -level formal flying course training requirements.
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP):—Incentive pay authorized for nonrated officers and
non -CEA X prefixed (Aircrew Members) or J prefixed or authorized jump AFSC (Parachutist
Members) required to perform hazardous duty required by orders issued IAW AFI 11-401s and
11-402. Examples of hazardous duty include flying duties as a crewmember on a frequent and
regular basis, jumps performed by a parachutist on a frequent and regular basis, explosives
demolition, duties inside a high- or low-pressure chamber.
Hours per Crewmember per Month (HCM):—The number of primary/secondary hours an
aircrew member flies per month. Average HCM data by MDS for line inexperienced aircrew
members (API -1s/2s/9s/As) is compared with planned/programmed HCM to help assess
aging/experiencing rates.
Inventory:—Inventory is defined by career field category (pilot, navigator/EWO, ABM, CEA)
as the number of Lt Col -and-below qualified aircrew members in the USAF. For inventory
purposes, an aircrew member is considered ―qualified‖ when he/she completes initial/basic flight
training and is awarded his/her wings. Lt Col-and-below aircrew members continue to be
counted as aircrew inventory for as long as they retain their aircrew rating and are medically
qualified to perform duties.
Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL):—The official listing of Lt Col -and-below aircrew
positions for which ―Joint credit‖ is authorized in compliance with the Goldwater-Nichols Act of
1976.

assigned to more than one MAJCOM as described in AFPD 10-9 Lead Operating Command
Weapon Systems Management.
Limited Experience (LIMEX) Aircrews:—Inexperienced aircrews who have completed
mission qualification training, but have not yet accumulated the hours required to be declared
―experienced‖ [e.g., 500 PAA hours required for new fighter pilots].
Loss Rates:—Derived from historical data and used in forecasting inventories. Retention rates
(percentage of a population which continues past a given year) and loss rates (1 minus the
retention rate) are computed for each year (2 through 28) and each MWS group.
Major Weapon System (MWS):—One of a limited number of systems or subsystems which,
for reasons of military urgency, criticality, or resource requirements, is determined by the
Department of Defense as being vital to national interest, (i.e., fighters, bombers, tankers, etc.)
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                     67


Non -major weapon systems are usually mission support (C-9/-12/-21; UH-1) or training (T-1/-
6/-37/-38). An MWS includes several similar aircraft; for example the tanker MWS includes
KC-135s and KC-10s.
Man- year:—A specific budgetary obligation of funds to support payment of incentive pay for
one person, for one fiscal year.
Maximum Absorption:—The maximum number of Undergraduate Flying Training graduates
and prior qualified pilots/navigators that a weapon system/weapons systems group can accept per
year. Absorption may be limited by training availability, minimum experience level, stability
goals, or number of vacancies in absorption units.
MCOPR- MAJCOM of Primary Responsibility (Lead Command):—The Command
designated as the primary advocate for a weapon system assigned to more than one MAJCOM as
described in AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating Command Weapon Systems Management.
Mission Design Series (MDS):—Specific aircraft designations (e.g., C -17, KC-10). Several
like MDSs comprise a Major Weapon System (MWS) category (e.g., the bomber MWS is
comprised of the B-1, B-2, and B-52 MDSs.
Non- rated or Non-CEA Aircrew Member:—A non-rated officer or non-CEA enlisted
member aircrew member qualified for aviation service, assigned to an approved aircrew prefixed
position, listed in an aircraft‘s crew composition complement in AFI 65-503, Table A36-1 and
required to perform aircrew duties on a full-time basis in order for the aircraft to perform its
primary mission. They are responsible for the safe ground and flight operations of the aircraft
and onboard systems.
Officer Assignment System (OAS):—Assignment system developed in FY95 that modified the
Officer Volunteer Assignment System rules. Significant changes included elimination of ―15-
year rule‖, establishment of assignment availability trigger (3-year time-on-
station/DEROS/completion of controlled tour), ―alert‖ notices of eligibility, and a system for
filling vacancies with non-volunteers if requesting MAJCOM deems necessary.
Officer Professional Development (OPD):—old term; now called Officer Force Development
Operational Aircraft:—Aircraft assigned to operational (vice, training, test, other) flying units;
these aircraft are PMAI (primary mission aircraft inventory) coded for the most part, and are
used in operational unit manning calculations along with crew ratios/composition.
Operational Support Aircraft (OSA):—Aircraft, such as the C -21, that are used for
operational support missions.
Operational Support Aircraft (OSA) Pilot:—For aircrew management purposes, a pilot whose
initial assignment from SUPT is to fly an OSA. An OSA pilot does not earn an MWS identifier
until he/she is subsequently assigned to an MWS.
Operations Support:—An individual whose primary, full -time duty does not require flying.
The Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis in order to perform a
specific, essential in-flight duty that a regularly assigned aircrew/mission crewmember cannot
perform.
Over- absorption:—Absorbing more new aircrew members into an MWS than the maximum
absorption capacity.
68                                                           AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


Overproduction:—Actual production exceeding programmed production.

of its wartime mission; these aircraft are coded CC, CA, or IF.
Prior- qualified Pilot (PQP):—A pilot who has completed a flying tour but has no experience
in his/her current weapon system. Most PQPs‘ post-UPT flying experience is not associated
with an MWS (FAIPs or OSA pilots).
Programmed Flying Training (PFT) Documents:—Consolidated documents whose goals are
to meet total force training requirements. MAJCOMs that provide training develop three -year
PFT documents to facilitate smooth training flow through long-term planning. The first year of
the PFT document contains detailed information with specific course information and projected
student data. The second and third years of the PFT contain less specific data, but should
provide projected course dates and training capacity information.
Quality of Life (QOL):—Phrase used to refer to the overall quality of life for a Service
member; affected by a combination of factors including average time on station (stability),
PERSTEMPO, compensation, housing, and medical benefits.
Rated Distribution and Training Management (RDTM):—The official term for rated
management. RDTM formalizes the concepts of predicting requirements, projecting inventory,
and establishing production and follow -on training for assignment into each MWS.
Rated Management Decision Support System (RMDSS):—The official Air Force computer
model for projecting rated inventory used until 2001, when it was replaced by AFRAMS (see
Atch 3 for details).
Rated Management Executive Council (RMEC):—Predecessor to Aircrew Management
Executive Council.
Rated Aircrew Requirement:—An authorization requiring a pilot, navigator/EWO, or air battle
manager, identified by a 10C0, 11XX, 12XX, or 13BX AFSC, or by an AFSC with an ―N‖ or
―P‖ prefix.
Rated Staff Allocation Plan:—Produced by AF/A3O -ATA in conjunction with the
Redline/Blueline, implements senior leadership guidance and priorities regarding the use of rated
resources.
Rated Supplement:—A program (phased out at the end of FY94) to use rated officers in
nonrated positions as a means to beddown surplus aviators, provide career -broadening
opportunities, and provide a surge capability for the rated force.
RDTM Code:—An identifier initially established when an officer is placed on assignment from
UFT. The RDTM code consists of two -characters: the first represents the MWS group and the
second identifies the specific weapon system or MDS.
Ready Aircrew Program (RAP):—Annual sortie/event training requirements for Fighter and
Bomber aircrews to maintain combat mission ready (CMR) status.
Recat:—Officer candidate who has had a change of career field prior to entering active duty.
Requirements:—Technically speaking, a requirement is a ―funded authorization‖. Most rated
requirements (force, training, test, and staff) are expressed as funded authorizations since they
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                      69


can be documented with an authorized position number and AFSC. However, some
requirements (advanced student/pipeline, transient, and AFIT/PME) are not authorizations but
man -year allocations; they are not identified with position numbers. For analytical purposes,
man-year allocations are treated as requirements.
Sorties per Crewmember per Month (SCM):—The number of sorties an aircrew member flies
per month. Average SCM data by MDS for line aircrew members (API -1s/2s/9s/As) is
compared with RAP and other sortie requirements.
Sources of Commissioning (SOCs):—Officer commissioning sources, which include the USAF
Academy, ROTC, and OTS.
Specific Aircrew Requirements:—Aircrew authorizations that require MWS -specific or
aircraft-specific (also termed MDS-specific) expertise (e.g., the Air Staff‘s Combat Forces
Requirements Division has a specific requirement for an aircrew member with bomber
expertise).
Spreadsheet Absorption Model (SPAM):—An old steady -state ―model‖ once used for
computing absorption.
Stability:—Three types of stability: 1) PCS Stability - Length of time an individual remains at
one base prior to a PCS. 2) Weapon System Stability - Length of time an individual remains
flying in a particular weapon system. 3) Aircraft Commander Stability - Length of time an
individual remains in an aircraft after upgrade to aircraft commander.
Sustainability:—The concept of producing aviators as required to maintain the desired
inventory (normally equal to requirements), based on replacing losses and ignoring constraints in
production, training, or absorption capacity. Numerically, sustainment is the total number of
new aircrew members needed each year to replace losses for a given level or requirements
(flying and non -flying).
Third Pilot:—A temporary program that was used to place UPT graduates as limited duty KC -
135 pilots in AMC in lieu of banking; this program has been terminated. These pilots got limited
flying hours and shared navigator duties. Most upgraded to copilot in about two years.
Total Active Rated Service (TARS):—The number of years an officer serves in the rated force,
from award of wings to separation, promotion to colonel, grounding, or retirement. TARS is
computed by summing 2 through 28 years of CCRs. TARS is one of the factors used in making
inventory (Blue Line) projections. It can also be used to make simplified inventory projections.
Two points to keep in mind are: 1) the TARS calculation is based on a 28-year steady state
environment; and 2), when any variable is changed that affects retention, TARS also changes.
Total Force Development (Total FD):—Very broad and includes institutional and occupational
components. Institutional development generally results in leadership, management, enterprise,
and warrior skill proficiency. Occupational development generally results in flying and technical
skill proficiency. Force Development generally utilizes a combination of the following means:
Education programs such as Professional Military Education, Executive Education, graduate
degree programs, or undergraduate degree program; Training programs such as technical
training, on -the-job training, flying training, ancillary training, expeditionary airman training;
and Experience gained through an appropriate series of job assignments or special programs such

as intern programs, education with industry, or fellowships in research organizations, and
leveraged through appropriate mentoring. See AFI 36-2640 for further reference.
Trained Personnel Requirements (TPR):—The number of personnel programmed to be
trained against Air Force requirements to maintain the Active force.
Airmen.—The number of airmen, by AF specialty, to be trained or retrained to meet production
requirements during the current and two subsequent years, as stated in the Airman Trained

Officer.—The number of officers, by AF specialty, to be trained to meet entry requirements
during the current year, as stated in the Officer Trained Personnel Requirements Document by
the Director of Personnel Programs, HQ USAF. (Source AFCAT 36-2223 Glossary).
Underproduction:—Actual production falling short of programmed production.
Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT):—flying training programs that result in formal award
of aviator wings (e.g., UPT, JSUNT)
Undergraduate Programmed Requirements Document (UPRD):—indicates the number of
graduates required from each undergraduate formal flying training course.
Unspecified Requirements:—See Generalist Requirements.
Usable Inventory:—The actual inventory available to fill rated positions (Lt Col and below). It
is derived from the total rated inventory after adjustments for rated officers who are serving in
Colonel positions or lack retainability
Yellow Box:—Line operational API -1/2/9/A positions to which inexperienced aircrews can be
assigned.

                     FORMULAS, MODELS, SYSTEMS, AND TOOLS

A2.1. The following are formulas used in Aircrew Management. The most critical metrics
are for Force (Operational) flying squadrons, since they are the basic war fighting units and the
ones identified and measured in the AF‘s Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) [ref
AFI 10-201]. NOTE: The calculations in this section are samples intended for illustration.
Thorough analysis would necessitate calculating the formulas for all crew positions and/or
AFSC‘s for a given aircraft.
   A2.1.1. Authorizations. Squadron Line Authorizations. Line authorizations for Force
   (Operational) flying units are determined based on calculations at the squadron (or smaller
   unit) level by crew position and/or by AFSC for aircrew management purposes.
       Force (Operational) Unit Manning Calculations:
       # Squadron Authorized Aircrew Members for each Aircrew Position (e.g., pilot; copilot;
navigator; flight engineer) = (# Squadron PMAI) x (Aircrew Ratio) x (# of particular
crewmember)
                Examples:
                F-16 Sqdn: 18 PMAI x 1.25 x 1 (1 Pilot) = 22.5 rounded to 23 authorized
       pilots
                C-130H Sqdn: 16 PMAI x 2.00 x 2 (Pilot Complement) = 64 authorized Pilots
                (32 AC + 32 CP)
                                 16 PMAI x 2.00 x 1 (Nav Complement) = 32 authorized Navs
                                 16 PMAI x 2.00 x 1 (FE Complement) = 32 authorized FEs
                                 16 PMAI x 2.00 x 2 (LM Complement) = 64 authorized LMs
                Note: For fractions, always round to next higher whole number.
                Note: Line authorizations for wing, NAF, MAJCOM, or by MDS / MWS, are
       calculated by summing the squadron authorizations of all the units under/within the larger
       organization/category, e.g. F-16 Wing API-1s are (18 PMAI x 1.25 x 1) + (18 PMAI x
       1.25 x 1) = 23 + 23 = 46.

       Squadron Total Authorizations. Include Line authorizations above and squadron
       leadership (i.e., Commander and/or Operations Officer).
              Examples:
              F-16 Sqdn (18 PMAI): 23 API-1 + 2 API-6 (Commander and Ops Officer) = 25
              C-130H Sqdn (16 PMAI): 64 API-1 + 2 Pilot API-6 (CC and DO) = 66 pilots
                                        32 API-2 + 0 Nav API-6 (CC and DO) = 32 Navs
                                        32 API-A + 0 FE API-B = 32 FEs
                                        64 API-A + 0 LM API-B = 64 LMs
              Note: Any API-6 Navs/ABMs are counted within their own category.

       Wing Authorizations. Include Squadron Total Authorizations above and API-6 (Lt Col
and below) flying staff positions earned by manpower standards (e.g., Safety; Current Ops).
NOTE: API-3 (non-flying) positions are not counted in formulas.
               Examples:
               F-16 Wing (with two 18 PMAI squadrons, OSS, and group/wing staff):
72                                                          AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


                    (23 API-1 + 2 API) + (23 API-1 + 2 API) + (9 API-6) + (7 API-6) = 66
            pilots
C-130H Wing (with two 16 PMAI squadrons, OSS, and group/wing staff):
                    (64 API-1 + 2 API-6) + (64 API-1 + 1 API-6) + (5 API-6) + (6 API-6) =
                    142 Pilots
                    (32 API-2 + 0 API-6) + (32 API-1 + 1 API-6) + (5 API-6) + (2 API-6) =
                    72 Navs
                    32 API-A + 32 API-A + 3 API-B + 3 API-B = 70 FEs
                    64 API-A + 64 API-A + 12 API-B + 3 API-B = 143 LMs
            Note: Any API-6 Navs/ABMs are counted within their own category.
     A2.1.2. Manning. Squadron Line Manning Percentages. For aircrew management
     purposes, Squadron Manning Percentages are calculated by crew position and/or by AFSC.
     Manning percentages are determined based on calculations at the squadron (or smaller unit)
     level. Manning for wing, NAF, MAJCOM, or by MDS / MWS is calculated by dividing the
     sum of the squadron assigned by the sum of the squadron authorized for all the units
     under/within the larger organization/category.
        Squadron Line Manning Percentage = (# API-1 Assigned) ÷ (# API-1 Authorized)
        Examples:
        F-16 Squadron: 25 (# Assigned API-1 Pilots) ÷ 23 (# Authorized API-1 Pilots) =
109%
        C-17 Squadron: 83 (# Assigned API-1 Pilots) ÷ 72 (# Authorized API-1 Pilots) =
115%

       Squadron Manning Notes:
        1) On loan from squadron should count against the squadron number (Key determinant:
Where is the billet?)
       2) Overmanning may be necessary to maintain squadron experience mix or when
overproduction and/or a decrease in force structure occurs. If a wing is overmanned, the
overmanning is typically accounted for at the squadron level.
       3) Manning percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.

      Squadron Total Manning Percentage. = (# API-1 + # API-6 Assigned) ÷ (# API-1 + #
API-6 Authorized)
      Examples:

              F-16 Squadron: 27 (# Assigned API-1 and API-6 Pilots) ÷ 25 (# Authorized
API-1 and API-6 Pilots) = 108%

             C-17 Squadron: 85 (# Assigned API-1 and API-6 Pilots) ÷ 74 (# Authorized
API-1 and API-6 Pilots) = 115%

       Wing Manning Percentage. For aircrew management purposes, wing manning
percentages are calculated by crew position and/or by AFSC.
       Wing Manning Percentage = (Total Wing Assigned) ÷ (Total Wing Authorized)
       Examples:
AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    73


        F-16 Wing (with Two 18 PMAI Squadrons, OSS, and Group/Wing Staff):
                70 Pilots Assigned ÷ 66 Pilots Authorized = 106% Manning
        C-17 Wing (with Three 12 PMAI Squadrons, OSS, and Group/Wing Staff):
                283 Pilots Assigned ÷ 239 Pilots Authorized = 118% Manning
          Wing Manning Notes:
        1) If a wing is undermanned, the wing staff (including the Operations Support Squadron)
should normally bear the burden of any experienced aircrew shortfalls so that the operational
flying squadrons can maintain full combat capability/readiness.
        2) Wing and/or base manning percentages are mainly used by AFPC; the more important
number for aircrew managers is squadron manning level.
   A2.1.3. Experience Mix (or Level). Squadron Line Experience Mix (or Level). For
   aircrew management purposes, Squadron Experience Mix is calculated by crew position
   and/or by AFSC. Line authorizations for Force (Operational) flying units are determined
   based on calculations at the squadron (or smaller unit) level. Line authorizations for wing,
   NAF, MAJCOM, or by MDS / MWS are calculated by summing the squadron authorizations
   of all the units under/within the larger organization/category. Objective experience levels by
   aircraft, MAJCOM and AFSC are addressed in MDS Vol 1‘s or documented on the Aircrew
   Requirements Community of Practice.
       Squadron Experience Mix = (# API-1 Experience Assigned) ÷ (# API-1 Total
Assigned)

         Examples:
         F-16: (12 API-1 Exp Pilots Assigned) ÷ (25 API-1 Total Pilots Assigned) = 48%
         C-17: (46 API-1 Exp Pilots Assigned) ÷ (83 API-1 ACs & CPs) = 55%
         NOTE: The squadron line formula is particularly useful as a programmatic formula
(e.g., to determine the aging portion of MDS flying hour programs).
Alternate formula to calculate squadron experience: 1- (#Inexperienced API 1 ÷ #API 1
authorizations)
NOTE: Because API 1 authorizations are used in the denominator, for overmanned units this
definition may overstate how inexperienced a unit is, while for undermanned units it may
understate it. For this reason, the product of this formula should always be accompanied with an
annotation of manning level.
         Squadron Total Experience Mix. Include Line Experience and squadron leadership
(i.e., Commander and/or Operations Officer).
         Examples
         F-16: (12 API-1 Exp Pilots Assigned + 2 API-6 Exp Pilots Assigned) ÷ (25 API-1 Total
Pilots Assigned + 2 API-6 Exp Pilots Assigned) = 14 ÷ 27 = 52%
         C-17: (46 API-1 Exp Pilots Assigned + 2 API-6 Exp Pilots Assigned) ÷ (83 API-1 ACs
& CPs Assigned + 2 API-6 ACs Assigned) = 48 ÷ 85 = 56%
         NOTE: The squadron total formula is particularly useful as an execution formula
(e.g., to monitor the balanced distribution/assignment of AF approved Distro Plans of UFT
grads).

       Wing Experience Mix
74                                                           AFI11-412 10 DECEMBER 2009


       Wing Experience Mix = (Total Wing API-1 Exp Assigned)÷ (Total Wing API-1
Assigned)
       Examples
       F-16 Wing (with Two 18 PMAI Squadrons, OSS, and Group/Wing Staff):
             44 API-1 Experienced Pilots Assigned ÷ 70 API-1 Pilots Assigned = 63%
       C-17 Wing (with Three 12 PMAI Squadrons, OSS, and Group/Wing Staff):
             161 API-1 Experienced Pilots Assigned ÷ 283 API-1 Pilots Assigned = 57%

       Note: Wing and/or base experience mix percentages are mainly used by AFPC; the more
important number for aircrew managers is squadron experience mix.
     A2.1.4. Average Time on Station (TOS). For aircrew management purposes, average TOS
     is calculated by crew position and/or by AFSC. It is a measurement of the average tour
     length of aircrew members on long (excludes remotes) flying tours in operational wings.
Average TOS has a major impact on unit readiness and formal training requirements. It is
typically measured for an entire MDS for use in absorption calculations. Ideally, average TOS is
calculated quarterly using the last four quarters of data. Average TOS is calculated based on
those
individuals that PCSed/PCAed out of an ops unit within the past year.
Average TOS equals the total TOS for those individuals that PCSed/PCSed
divided by the total number of aircrew members with the AFSC is the
respective MDS who PCSed/PCAed out of an ops unit.

Average TOS = (AMTOS1 + AMTOS2 + AMTOS3 . . . + AMTOSn ) ÷ (AM1 + AM2 +
AM3 . . . + AMn)
where AMTOS = time on station for an aircrew member and AM = aircrew member.
             Pilot Example:
                      TOS (months)                     Pilot

                            128 total TOS       4 pilots PCSed/PCAed
             Average TOS = 128 total TOS ÷ 4 pilots = 32 months average TOS per pilot

               A simplified example shows the potential effects of average TOS on training.
               API-1s                Average TOS (yrs)                      Turnover/Year
               1200                       4.0*                   =             300
               1200                       3.0                    =             400
If an MWS has 1200 operational line API-1 pilot positions and the average TOS is 4.0 years, it
would require 300 positions to be vacated and filled (i.e., 600 moves - 300 out and 300 in) to
keep the MWS 100% manned. If the average TOS were 3.0 years, the turnover would be 800
(400 moves out and in). Some turnover could be ops-to-ops or FTU instructor-to-ops moves;
nevertheless, a lower average TOS will increase the formal flying training requirements.

*NOTE: TOS is often stated as month and year (e.g., 2.8 equates to 2 years, 8 months).

   A2.1.5. Total Active Rated Service (TARS): The number of years an officer serves in the
   rated force, from award of wings to separation, promotion to colonel, grounding, or
   retirement. TARS is computed by summing 2 through 28 years of CCRs. TARS is one of
   the factors used in making inventory (Blue Line) projections. It can also be used to make
   simplified inventory projections. Two points to keep in mind are: 1) the TARS calculation
   is based on a projected steady state environment; and, 2) when any variable is changed that
   affects retention, TARS also changes.
   A2.1.6. Inventory. Total Inventory = Total Production X Total TARS
MWS Inventory = MWS Absorption X MWS TARS
Simple Retention (SR) = # of Flyers Remaining at End of YOS / # of Flyers Starting YOS
Cumulative Continuation Rate (CCR) 6-11 = SR 6YOS x SR 7YOS x SR 8YOS x …… x SR 11YOS
A2.2. Descriptions. The following are descriptions of the approved models, systems, and tools
used in Aircrew Management:
Flying Training Resource Analysis and Programming (FTRAP) System. A set of integrated
resource and capacity models used to translate Air Force formal flying training taskings (as
documented in Program Requirements Documents and approved syllabi) into the resources
needed to execute that tasking. The principal outputs of the system are flying hour requirements,
aircraft requirements, and instructor requirements for undergraduate pilot training and instructor
training courses. The models in FTRAP calculate capacity for each base/aircraft, distribute the
production tasking among the bases, and then calculate the resources required by base/aircraft.
The FTRAP system is also used to help analyze FTU and other aircrew training requirements.
FTRAP is maintained by HQ AETC/A3R and is the official AF instructor manning model.

Air Force Rated Aircrew Management System (AFRAMS). AFRAMS is an entity-based
Arena simulation model used to provide official aircrew inventory projections for use in
requirements-inventory (Redline/Blueline) and prioritization plan preparations. Beginning with
actual rated inventory (―hand-scrubbed‖ by AFPC for accuracy), the model simulates major
events in the rated personnel lifecycle for every officer, with distinct model runs for pilots,
CSOs, and ABMs. All model inputs (e.g., production, bonus take rate, etc.) are developed and/or
coordinated among HQ AF/A1PF, HQ AF/A1PPR, and HQ AF/A3O-ATA.

Aircrew 480 System (A480S). A480S is the web-based tool used to securely manage all of the
active duty aircrew position descriptions worldwide. The capability automates the AF Form 480
process, defines all of the active duty parameters for each aircrew (flying and staff) position, and
provides selectively-controlled review, update, and approval access to the information for the
authorized, global user community.

Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS). AAMS is a web-based Aircrew
Management metric tool developed to ensure weapon systems are optimally manned and flying
hours are efficiently executed. The system manages aircrew absorption, training, aging,
experience, and upgrade progress and can predict future aircrew issues so they can be corrected
before they impact the mission.

Comprehensive Aircrew Resource Projection (CARP). Excel based model which uses
projected program data (Force Structure, Crew Ratio, Crew Complement, Experience Aircrew
Criteria, etc.) to provide estimates of future sustainable aircrew inventories.

Enigma. An Excel based desktop decision support model that allows senior-level decision-
makers to quickly examine the impacts and effectiveness of potential rated management policy
decisions. Through real-time analytic calculations, Enigma balances rated production with
resource constraints and provides insight into the ability to sustain future rated force
requirements. Enigma provides the capability to consider how changes to any of the 5,000 input
variables impact the rated management system inventories and requirements. Variables include
aircraft inventory, crew ratios, experience mixes, initial rated inventories, undergraduate
production, aircraft UTE, experience requirements, continuation rates, and emerging staff
requirements. Manipulating these variables allows for consideration of virtually any scenario.
