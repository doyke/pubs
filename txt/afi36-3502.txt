                                               Chapter 1

                                          INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction describes the set of performance management indicators, and associated
reporting requirements, necessary to indicate successful accomplishment of the mission of the United
States Air Force Academy (USAFA), as set forth in AF Policy Directive 36-35, United States Air Force
Academy.

1.2. AFI Organization. Individual sets of measures, both in aggregate and alone, are designed to provide
insight into one of the four major areas identified in AFPD 36-35 United States Air Force Academy: Char-
acter Development, Educational Development, Leadership Development, and Physical Development. The
sets of measures are designed to provide insight into admissions, the performance of the preparatory
school and general governance of the USAFA.

1.3. Reporting Requirements. The unique reporting requirements, goals and thresholds are presented
within each chapter, along with the appropriate performance measures. In addition, the goals and thresh-
olds associated with each measure are listed in Appendix A of this AFI. Reporting is on primarily an aca-
demic year (AY) basis, and reports are required quarterly, by semester, or annually. The total list of
reporting requirements by time is listed in Chapter 9 of this AFI.
   1.3.1. Delegation of Performance Management. Individual measures will be managed by USAFA
   to the pre-established thresholds. Any time a measure is not within the threshold at the required
   reporting time, USAFA will submit the corresponding raw data (in addition to the pictorial graph/
   chart) for that measure at that reporting period. The submittal will only indicate that the measure was
   within the threshold. This reporting procedure will not apply to the following measures:
              - Measure 3C1 Sexual Assault Allegations
              - Measure 3D Cadet Incident Report
              - Measure 3E Cadet Climate Survey
              - Measure 5E Graduate Active Duty Performance
              - Measure 7D Permanent Party Climate Survey
              - The Summary-at-a-Glance Report

1.4. Procedures. All data will be collected based upon the Academic Year (Graduation – Graduation)
except as required due to special circumstances that dictate a distinctive reporting period to properly
present required information. USAFA will collect and analyze the data required by each of the perfor-
mance measures, and submit both the pictorial graphs/charts (Para 1.8.) for each measure and the Sum-
mary-at-a-Glance Report (Chapter 9) to AF/DPLA. Several measures have predetermined thresholds that
will require immediate notification of HAF if they are breached. Any time submittal does not meet or
exceed the established goal for a given measure USAFA will include an explanation as to why the goal
was not met, and a description of any appropriate corrective action plan.

1.5. Assessment Reports. USAFA will submit an annual Academy Assessment Report covering the
Academy and the Academy Preparatory School to AF/DPLA no later than 10 November of each year that
6                                                                         AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005


complies with DoDD 1322.22 Section 6, para 6.1, Academy Assessment Report and para 6.2 Preparatory
School Assessment Report.

1.6. USAFA Oversight. This Performance Management Program will not limit the flow of information
between USAFA and HAF. USAFA may supplement the information required by this AFI with any data
USAFA leadership deems is necessary. Conversely, submittal of the information required by this AFI
does not eliminate the requirement for USAFA to respond to requests for information from elements of
USAFA Oversight, such as the General Officer Steering Committee, the Executive Steering Group, the
Board of Visitors, SAF/MR or AF/DP. The complete oversight structure for USAFA is described in AFI
36-3501 Headquarters Air Force Leadership Guidance for the United States Air Force.

1.7. Demographics. Demographics are considered in monitoring the results of Air Force leaderships’
efforts to enhance performance, sustain excellence in each of the Air Force’s core competencies, and to
identify indicators of potential personnel concerns.

1.8. Presentation of Performance Measure Data. Data from each performance measure will be pre-
sented in the form of pictorial graphs/charts. The graphs/charts will be created and portrayed in a manner
that best illustrates what the performance measure was designed to ascertain. To ensure accurate units of
comparison, particularly when the base group is susceptible to change, use rates per thousand rather than
comparing raw total numbers. To ensure each performance measure provides a broad enough comparison,
include a bar (or other graphic illustration) in each graph/chart that represents an average of the preceding
years. The ideal average would capture the previous ten years however, at a minimum capture the average
of the previous four-years, when available.

                                    ADMISSIONS MEASURES

2.1. Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and Air Force leadership
can assess the incoming class of cadets to maximize the Academy’s effectiveness in attracting talented
applicants from all segments of society and admitting outstanding young men and women who possess
the potential to excel during the Academy four year experience and graduate as commissioned officers in
service of the Air Force and the nation. The following measures will be used:
           2A1 Annual Admissions--Total Applicants

       2.2.2.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported by the end of
       the Second Quarter.
       2.2.2.2. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with indicators of trends in the
       admissions process regarding gender.
   2.2.3. Performance Measure 2A3: Annual Admissions--Minorities. This measure presents the
   total number of minority (e.g. combined numbers of American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or
   Pacific Islander, Black not Hispanic, or Hispanic) applications, qualified applicants, candidates,
   offers, and admitted for each admission cycle. This measure reflects the number of minorities admit-
   ted to USAFA by each academic year. USAFA will present data from the 3 previous years to show a
   4-year trend.

       2.2.3.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported by the end of
       the Second Quarter.
       2.2.3.2. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with indicators of trends in the
       admissions process regarding the total number of minorities.
    2.2.4. Performance Measure 2A4: Annual Admissions--Minority Group. This measure presents
    and compares the number of each minority group (e.g. American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or
    Pacific Islander, Black not Hispanic, Hispanic) admitted to USAFA each academic year. USAFA will
    present data from 3 previous years to show 4-year trend.
       2.2.4.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported by the end of
       the Second Quarter.

       admissions process regarding the number of each minority category.
    2.2.5. Performance Measure 2A5: Annual Admissions--Recruited Athletes. A maximum 25%
    recruited athletes will be admitted to USAFA each year. This measure presents the percent of each
    entering class that are recruited athletes. USAFA will present data from the 3 previous years to show
    a 4-year trend.
       2.2.5.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported by the end of
       the Second Quarter.
       2.2.5.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is <25%. The threshold is >25%.
       2.2.5.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate to USAFA leadership its annual compliance with
       the standard that <25% of the entering class will be recruited athletes.
    2.2.6. Performance Measure 2A6: Annual Admissions--Potentially Pilot Qualified (PPQ). T h e
    measure presents the percent of cadets admitted each year who are PPQ and compares it to the percent
    of those PPQ that are athletes, women, and minorities (e.g. total number of American Indian or Alaska
    Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black not Hispanic, or Hispanic). USAFA will present data from the
    3 previous years to show a 4-year trend.
       2.2.6.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported by the end of
       the Second Quarter.
       2.2.6.2. Rationale. To provide trends regarding the pool of candidates the Academy can draw
       from to meet Air Force pilot requirements.

                           CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT MEASURES

3.1. Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership can
assess the progress of cadet character development:
   3.1.1. Maintaining a Cadet Honor Code that establishes in each cadet a sense of personal integrity that
   will serve as the cornerstone for a life of dedication to our country.
   3.1.2. Developing in each cadet a standard of values and those qualities and skills, such as a strong
   sense of honor, duty, integrity, moral-ethical strength, intellectual interests, discipline, strength of
   character, the ability to maintain equitable relationships within a diverse workforce, and the ability to
   build and maintain trust, individually and organizationally, necessary to progressive and continuing
   development as a person of integrity and a professional military leader.
   3.1.3. Teaching cadets that loyalty to the values of the institution of the Air Force must be placed
   above loyalty to any individual or peers. Commissioning only officers of integrity and outstanding
   moral character. The following performance measures will be used:
   3A1 Honor Cases by Wing
   3A2 Honor Cases by Class
   3A3 Annual Honor Probation Outcomes
   3B Cadet (MEO) Military Equal Opportunity Cases by Category
   3C1 Cadet Sexual Assault Allegations
   3C2 Sexual Assault Report Formal vs. Confidential
   3D1 Cadet Incident Report
   3D2 Unfavorable Information File (UIF) Status
   3E Cadet Climate Survey Results
   3F Interactive Learning
   3G Prevention and Awareness Training

3.2. Performance Measurement Area: Honor System. The number of cadet honor violations is one
indicator of character development within the Cadet Wing. Note: To ensure data is not misleading,
USAFA will include the total number of cadet offenders (i.e. one cadet may commit multiple infractions)
and the total number of adjudicated incidents of misconduct where formal action was taken (i.e. allega-
tions vs. confirmed incidents).
   3.2.1. Performance Measure 3A1: Honor Cases--By Wing. This measure presents the number of
   honor cases as defined in the Air Force Cadet Wing Honor Code Reference Handbook and USAFAI
   36-168. USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend.
       3.2.1.1. Reporting Requirements. USAFA will be required to collect, analyze and submit this
       data quarterly and annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals, and be submitted NLT
       30 days after the end of the spring semester.
10                                                                        AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005


        3.2.1.2. Threshold. The threshold is: Total violations >2% of the cadet population. (Note: a
        trend of low or no violations could be an indication of tolerance.)
        3.2.1.3. Rationale. This measure may indicate negative or positive trends in character develop-
        ment.
     3.2.2. Performance Measure 3A2: Honor Cases--By Class. This measure presents the number of
     monthly honor cases (e.g. violations, probations, disenrolled, other) for each class. USAFA will
     present data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend.
        3.2.2.1. Reporting Requirements. USAFA will be required to collect, analyze and submit this
        data monthly and annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals, and be submitted NLT
        30 days after the end of the Spring Semester.
        3.2.2.2. Thresholds. The thresholds are: Fourth-Class violations >2% of the class population;
        First, Second, and Third Class violations >1% of the class population. (Note: A trend of low or no
        violations could be an indication of tolerance.)
        3.2.2.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends in Honor Code viola-
        tions.
     3.2.3. Performance Measure 3A3: Honor Probation Outcomes--By Wing. This measure com-
     pares the number of wing honor probation outcomes in the following category: unsuccessful proba-
     tion completion. USAFA will present data from the previous 7 years with each report to show an
     8-year trend.
        3.2.3.1. Reporting Requirements. USAFA will be required to collect, analyze and submit this
        data annually, NLT 30 days after the end of the Spring Semester.
        3.2.3.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: >95% successful completion. The
        threshold is: When successful probations are <80% of the number of cadets on probation.
        3.2.3.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends in regarding the reha-
        bilitative effect of probation.

3.3. Performance Measurement Area: Cadet MEO Case. MEO cases reflect the degree to which
USAFA cadets maintain equitable relationships within a diverse workforce and adhere to Air Force poli-
cies concerning discrimination.
     3.3.1. Performance Measurement 3B: Cadet MEO Cases--By Category. This measure compares
     allegations and substantiated cases of sexual harassment and unlawful discrimination in the following
     categories: race, gender, national origin, color, and religion. USAFA will present data from the previ-
     ous 3 years to show a 4-year trend. Note: USAFA will include the number and nature of sexual harass-
     ment allegations and substantiated cases that required the involvement by the Academy Response
     Team (i.e. as a supplement to MEO involvement); as well as including all cadet complaints, even if the
     person(s) complained of are faculty and staff or other Air Force personnel.
        3.3.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported both quarterly,
        and annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals and be submitted NLT 30 days after
        the end of the Spring Semester.
        3.3.1.2. Threshold. The threshold is: >0 MEO cases. (Note: A trend of low or no violations
        could be an indication of tolerance.)
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                                 11


       3.3.1.3. Rationale. These indicators enhance leaderships’ ability to increasingly narrow their
       focus until root causes of perceptions of personnel are properly identified and addressed. Leader-
       ship also gains invaluable insight about USAFA’s culture and environment from the cadets’ per-
       spective.

3.4. Performance Measurement Area: Cadet Sexual Assault Allegations. The numbers of alleged
sexual assaults are one indication of USAFA cadets’ maintenance of equitable relationships within a
diverse workforce and adherence to Air Force policies concerning sexual assault.
   3.4.1. Performance Measure 3C1: Cadet Sexual Assault Allegations--By Wing. T h i s m e a s u r e
   includes the number and nature of sexual assaults alleged each month by USAFA cadets and reported
   to the Academy Response Team (ART). The ART shall confirm that their report includes all allega-
   tions reported to them during the relevant period by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), Secu-
   rity Forces Squadron and any other non-confidential entity. This measure does not include anonymous
   or confidential reports to the Chaplains or to off-base organizations or any reports of sexual assault
   that occurred before the cadet arrived at the Academy. USAFA will present data from the previous 3
   years with each report to show a 4-year trend. Note: Distinguish between alleged perpetrators that are
   cadets, other alleged perpetrators associated with the Academy, and alleged perpetrators not associ-
   ated with the Academy (e.g., off-base civilians etc.). Also, clearly annotate and distinguish allegations
   of sexual assault from command or judicial determinations that a sexual assault occurred (i.e. percep-
   tions vs. substantiated incidents).
       3.4.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported quarterly and
       annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals and be submitted NLT 30 days after the
       end of the spring semester. USAFA leadership will immediately notify the SecAF or CSAF any
       time they become aware of an alleged sexual assault involving a cadet.
       3.4.1.2. Threshold. The threshold is: >0 allegations/month. (Note: a trend of low or no allega-
       tions could be an indication that victims are unwilling to report.)
       3.4.1.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate sexual assault allegation trends.
   3.4.2. Performance Measure 3C2: Sexual Assault Report: Formal vs. Confidential. T h i s m e a -
   sure will reflect the number of sexual assault allegations made through confidential avenues compared
   to sexual assault allegations made to non-confidential entities (including the Office of Special Investi-
   gations and Security Forces) and submitted as an aggregate report by the Academy Response Team
   (ART). This only includes reports of sexual assaults that occurred while the victim was a cadet.
   USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years with each report to show a 4-year trend. Note: Dis-
   tinguish between alleged perpetrators that are cadets, other alleged perpetrators associated with the
   Academy, and alleged perpetrators not associated with the Academy (e.g., off-base civilians etc.).
   Also, clearly annotate and distinguish allegations of sexual assault from command or judicial determi-
   nations that sexual assault offenses occurred (i.e. perceptions vs. substantiated incidents).
       3.4.2.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported quarterly and
       annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals and be submitted NLT 30 days after the
       end of the spring Semester. USAFA leadership will immediately notify the SecAF or CSAF any
       time they become aware of an alleged sexual assault involving a member of USAFA.
       3.4.2.2. Rationale. This measure will indicate to USAFA leadership a fuller picture of the health
       of the formal and informal reporting systems.

3.5. Performance Measurement Area: Cadet Incident Report. The number of instances of cadet dis-
cipline problems is one indication of the development of cadet character.
     3.5.1. Performance Measure 3D1: Cadet Incident Report. This measure will present the number
     of instances of cadet discipline problems in the Cadet Wing in the following categories: assault,
     harassment, improper use of government network, drugs, destruction of private/ government property,
     theft/larceny, DUI/DWAI, providing alcohol to minors, false ID, underage drinking, other alcohol
     related incidents, “other” (e.g. any misconduct not otherwise stated that would be chargeable under
     the UCMJ). Data will be displayed for each of the four quarters and will include annual totals in each
     category. Note: To ensure data is not misleading, USAFA will include the total number of cadet
     offenders (i.e. one cadet may commit multiple infractions) and the total number of adjudicated inci-
     dents of misconduct where formal action was taken.
        3.5.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported quarterly and
        annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals and be submitted NLT 30 days after the
        end of Spring Semester.
        3.5.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: less than 1% of the cadet popula-
        tion per quarter. The threshold is: >2% of cadet population per quarter.
        3.5.1.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate negative and positive trends in cadet adherence to
        Air Force Core Values.

3.6. Performance Measurement Area: Unfavorable Information Files. The number of Unfavorable
Information Files (UIFs) created on cadets every semester is an indicator of character development.
     3.6.1. Performance Measure 3D2: Unfavorable Information Files--By Class. This measure will
     present the number of UIFs created each year, by class. Trends regarding the character of the infrac-
     tions will also be included, by class, for insight into the nature of the cadet behaviors involved.
     USAFA will report significant trends from the previous 3 years, to show a 4-year trend.
        3.6.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of each semester.
        3.6.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: <.2% of cadet population per
        semester. The threshold is: >.4% of the cadet population per semester.
        3.6.1.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends in cadet adherence to
        Air Force Core Values and insight into the nature and patterns of inappropriate cadet behavior.

3.7. Performance Measurement Area: Cadet Climate Survey. The Survey is a tool to enhance
USAFA leaderships’ ability to rapidly identify and correct root causes of misperceptions or negative orga-
nizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions. Consequently, the indicators revealed by the Survey
require further exploration by USAFA leadership. The annual Cadet Climate Survey will be conducted
IAW AFI 36-2601 and will assess multiple factors. USAFA will send raw data to AFPC/DPA for analysis.
AFPC/DPA, in turn, will analyze, store, and submit the results to AF/DPLA. To ensure perceptions of
minorities are not overlooked, data should not be presented using an “80% positive – 20% negative rule”
as a gauge (i.e. minority groups tend to make up less than 20% of the cadet population). Do not use per-
centages (present the actual number of cadets/survey responses) when presenting data pertaining to zero
tolerance policies (e.g. unlawful discrimination, hostile environment, sexual harassment/assault etc.).
Include a sample of both positive and negative cadet comments with the statistical data for each category
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                                 13


of questions to enhance leadership insight into cadet perceptions. Provide root causes of misperceptions
or negative organizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions identified after further exploration of
the indicators, corrective measures taken, and the method leadership used to close the feedback loop with
cadets.
   3.7.1. Performance Measure 3E: Cadet Climate Survey Results--By Year.
   This measure will consist of the complete data and associated analysis from the annual cadet climate
   survey.
       3.7.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected and reported to AFPC/DPA in raw
       form. AFPC/DPA will analyze and report results annually NLT 30 days after the end of the Fall
       Semester.

3.8. Performance Measurement Area: Interactive Learning Process. The effectiveness of the Center
for Character Development (CCD) efforts are enhanced by character based instruction that permeates the
USAFA training spectrum and capitalizes on interactive learning processes designed to engage cadets
physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
   3.8.1. Performance Measure 3F: Average Number of Hours--By Class. This measure presents an
   analysis of cadet feedback, by class, pertaining to the degree CCD character based instruction perme-
   ates the USAFA training spectrum and capitalizes on interactive learning processes designed to
   engage cadets physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
       3.8.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT
       30 days following the end of the spring semester.
       3.8.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 100% of cadets engage in interac-
       tive character based learning processes each year. The threshold is: <90% of cadets receive 8
       hours of character-based instruction each year.
       3.8.1.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends regarding the effective-
       ness of CCD’s approach to character development. It will provide USAFA leadership with a fuller
       picture regarding the extent CCD permeates the USAFA training spectrum and capitalizes on
       interactive learning processes that engage cadets physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

3.9. Performance Measurement Area: Sexual Assault Prevention, and Reporting. USAFA requires
annual cadet training on preventing and reporting sexual assault for cadets.
   3.9.1. Performance Measure 3G: Number of Hours for Instructor and Cadets. T h i s m e a s u r e
   presents the number of hours of training cadets receive annually, by class, and the number of hours of
   training each instructor receives annually. USAFA will present data from the 3 previous years to show
   a 4-year trend.
       3.9.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT
       30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
       3.9.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 3 hours per person. The threshold
       is: <90% of either cadets or instructors receive <3 hours of training in a year.
       3.9.1.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends in annual training.

                           EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT MEASURES

4.1. Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership can
assess the progress of the educational development of cadets. The following performance measurements
will be used to collectively indicate the degree to which USAFA cadets are developing educationally and
maximize USAFA effectiveness in:
     4.1.1. Providing a broad education in the arts and sciences leading to a Bachelor of Science degree.
        4.1.1.1. Orienting, structuring, and maintaining the core academic curriculum, as well as require-
        ments associated with academic majors, to emphasize mastery of the scientific and technical sub-
        jects in order to develop Air Force officers who can conceptualize, acquire, test, deliver and
        sustain new and innovative technologies.
        4.1.1.2. Developing future Air Force officers with international insight, foreign language profi-
        ciency, and the cultural understanding to meet the requirements of the expeditionary air and space
        force concept. For those cadets who pursue degrees in the humanities and social sciences, observe
        stringent requirements for the study of foreign languages.
        4.1.1.3. Fostering in each cadet, in the prescribed subject areas, the acquisition of knowledge that
        focuses on mastery of reasoning processes, clarity of expression, the ability to make sound deci-
        sions, and the ability to weigh, integrate, and apply such knowledge and skills to problems of
        national security and military operations.
     4.1.2. Motivating cadets to seek and excel in initial assignments as operational professionals perform-
     ing the front line warfighting mission of the Air Force before branching off into non-combat related
     functional career fields.
     4.1.3. Developing within each cadet, a thorough understanding of, respect for, and full and active sup-
     port of military to civilian relationships inherent in military service. The following measures will be
     used:
     4A Academic Review Committees
     4B Majors
     4C First Assignment of USAFA Graduates by Career Area
     4D1 Cadet Grade Point Average By Class
     4D2 Cadet Grade Point Average By Specific Group
     4E Cadets Placed on Academic Probation
     4F Foreign Language Minor
     4G Foreign Language Proficiency
     4H Foreign Language Enrollments
     4I Cultural Understanding
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                                  15


4.2. Performance Measurement Area: Academic Review Committee. The number of cadet records
that meet the Academic Review Committee Board is one indicator of the educational development of
cadets. Academic Review Committees (ARCs) meet when a cadet’s cumulative GPA is below a 2.0, the
cadet has a grade of D or lower, or is referred by the DF staff (per criteria established in Curriculum Hand-
book).
   4.2.1. Performance Measure 4A: Academic Review Committees--By Class. This measure pre-
   sents the number of cadet academic records that are reviewed by the Academic Review Committee
   (ARC), and the number of cadets that are disenrolled through the ARC process for each class. USAFA
   will present data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend.
       4.2.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
       following the end of each semester. The report for the Spring Semester will include annual totals.
       4.2.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: <1% disenrolled annually. The
       threshold is: >1% disenrolled annually.
       4.2.1.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate positive and negative trends in cadet academic
       development.

4.3. Performance Measurement Area: Majors. There is a greater need for technical degrees within the
senior leadership of the Air Force. It is important for USAFA to be cognizant of the academic degree pro-
duction process and to emphasize to cadets the importance of obtaining technical degrees in specific
areas. This measure will reflect the degree USAFA emphasizes mastery of the scientific and technical
subjects in order to develop Air Force officers, who can conceptualize, acquire, test, deliver, and sustain
new and innovative technologies in the future.
   4.3.1. Performance Measure 4B: Majors--By Class. This measure presents the number of cadets,
   by class, that are technical majors, non-technical majors, or are undeclared. This data will be com-
   pared to the five-year forecast of USAFA’s annual production requirements by degree. USAFA will
   present data from the previous 3 years with each report to show a 4-year trend.
       4.3.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT
       30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
       4.3.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: USAFA’s annual production
       requirements by degree. The threshold is: >2 cadets (or 10% whichever is greater) below the pro-
       duction rate requirement for any degree.
       4.3.1.3. Rationale. This measure will indicate how effectively USAFA factors in attrition rates to
       ensure annual production requirements by degree are met. It will also indicate of how well
       USAFA graduates will be able to support and advance an increasingly technical Air Force.

4.4. Performance Measurement Area: First Assignment of USAFA Graduates. All USAFA gradu-
ates (except those designated by CSAF and SECAF) are to enter the Air Force as 2Lts in operational line
AFSCs at the wing level or below.
   4.4.1. Performance Measure 4C: First Assignment of USAFA Graduates--By Career Area.
   This measure presents the number of cadets that receive initial operational assignments in each of the
   following career areas: pilot, navigator, non-rated operations, base support, other non-rated opera-
   tions, continuing education, or special duty assignments on an annual basis. It will compare numbers
16                                                                       AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005


     of males and females and compare numbers of minorities (i.e. total number of all minority categories)
     and others. USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend.
        4.4.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT
        30 days following the end of the spring semester.
        4.4.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 100% at operational wing level and
        below. The threshold is: Any assignment above wing level not approved by CSAF or SecAF.
        4.4.1.3. Rationale. This measure indicates positive or negative accession trends.

4.5. Performance Measurement Area: Cadet Grade Point Average (GPA). Cadet GPAs are one indi-
cator of the educational development of cadets.
     4.5.1. Performance Measure 4D1: Cadet Grade Point Average (GPA)--By Class. This measure
     presents cadet GPA, by class, for each semester. USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years to
     show a 4-year trend.
        4.5.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of each semester. The report for the Spring Semester will include annual totals.
        4.5.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: >2.9 GPA. The threshold is: < 2.5
        GPA.
        4.5.1.3. Rationale. This measure indicates positive or negative cadet academic achievement
        trends.
     4.5.2. Performance Measure 4D2: Grade Point Average (GPA)--By Group. This measure pre-
     sents cadet GPA, by male/female, recruited athletes/non-recruited athletes, and minority (i.e. total
     American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hawaiian or Other Pacific
     Islander, Hispanic or Latino)/non-minority (i.e. total of all cadets excluding minorities), for each
     semester. USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend.
        4.5.2.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of each semester. The report for the Spring Semester will include annual totals.
        4.5.2.2. Rationale. This may indicate institutional issues warranting further analysis.

4.6. Performance Measurement Area: Cadets Placed on Academic Probation. The number of cadet
placed on academic probation is one indicator of the educational development of cadets.
     4.6.1. Performance Measure 4E: Cadets Placed on Academic Probation--By Class. T h i s m e a -
     sure presents the number of cadets, by class, placed on probation each semester. USAFA will present
     data from the previous 3 years with each report to show a 4-year trend. Note: To ensure data is not
     misleading, USAFA will include the total number of applicable cadets (i.e. a cadet may have been
     placed on Academic Probation more than once).
        4.6.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of each semester. The report for the Spring Semester will include annual totals.
        4.6.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 0 cadets on academic probation.
        The thresholds are: 4th Class >30% on probation, 3rd Class >20%, 2nd Class >15%, 1st Class
        >10%.
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                                 17


       4.6.1.3. Rationale. This may indicate positive or negative trends in academic development.

4.7. Performance Measurement Area – Foreign Language (FL) Exposure and Proficiency. USAFA
desires to provide foundational foreign language skills to all interested cadets and to create officers with
functional proficiency from cadets with special talents and experiences. The number of cadets earning a
FL minor and the number of cadets testing 2/2 or higher on the Defense Language Proficiency Test
(DLPT) are measures of how well this goal is being attained.
   4.7.1. Performance measure 4F: Foundational Foreign Language Minor--By Year. P r e s e n t
   number of cadets who have earned the FL minor by year and by language.
       4.7.1.1. Reporting Requirements : Data will be collected, analyzed and reported by annually
       NLT 30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
       4.7.1.2. Goal and Thresholds: The goal is: >15% of each graduating class earns a FL minor. The
       threshold is: <10% of cadets graduating with a FL minor.
       4.7.1.3. Rationale. This will indicate positive or negative trends meeting Air Force language
       requirements.
   4.7.2. Performance Measure 4G: FL Proficiency as measured by the DLPT--By Year. P r e s e n t
   number of cadets who have scored 2/2 or higher on the DLPT by language.
       4.7.2.1. Reporting Requirements: Data will be collected, analyzed and reported annually NLT
       30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
       4.7.2.2. Goals and Thresholds : The goal is: >5% of each graduating class proficient at the 2/2
       level as measured by the DLPT. The threshold is: <3% of cadets scoring 2/2 on the DLPT at grad-
       uation.
       4.7.2.3. Rationale. This will indicate positive or negative trends meeting Air Force language
       requirements.

4.8. Performance Measurement Area--Foreign Language Enrollment in DoD Investment Lan-
guages reflecting current and future USAF operations. The USAF requires greater emphasis on languages
that are generally not taught in US high schools, but are spoken in regions of the world reflecting current
and future operations. USAFA will emphasize high-priority languages (Arabic, Chinese, and Russian) by
shifting enrollments from common languages (German, French and Spanish).
   4.8.1. Performance Measure 4H: Foreign Language Enrollment--By Language. Present foreign
   language enrollments by class year and by language, and show historical data for previous three years,
   with special emphasis on high-priority languages like Arabic, Chinese and Russian.
       4.8.1.1. Reporting Requirements : Data will be collected, analyzed and reported annually NLT
       30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
       4.8.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal is: 30% of total USAFA enrollments in high-priority
       languages (Arabic, Chinese, and Russian). The threshold is: <25% of total enrollments in Arabic,
       Chinese, and Russian.
       4.8.1.3. Rationale. This will indicate positive or negative trends reconciling USAFA production
       and USAF requirements.
18                                                                       AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005


4.9. Performance Measurement Area--Cultural Understanding. USAFA desires to improve the cul-
tural understanding and sensitivity of all cadets in preparation for the increasingly expeditionary USAF,
employed with coalition forces.
     4.9.1. Performance Measure 4I: Cultural Understanding--By Class. This measure will present
     the number of graduating cadets who have earned a foreign area studies major, the number of cadets
     who have earned FL minor and the number of cadets who have spent “boots-on-the-ground” time in a
     non-English speaking foreign country as part of a USAFA research, exchange or foreign visits pro-
     gram. USAFA will show historical data for the previous three years.
        4.9.1.1. Reporting Requirements : Data will be collected, analyzed and reported by annually
        NLT 30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
        4.9.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal is: to steadily increase the total number of cadets in
        each graduating class who have spent time overseas or who have received training in cross-cul-
        tural communication. The threshold is: a negative trend in these numbers.
        4.9.1.3. Rationale. This will indicate positive or negative trends in USAFA efforts to increasingly
        incorporate multicultural understanding into the officer development system.
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                              19

                          LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT MEASURES

5.1. Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership can
assess the progress of the leadership development of cadets. Successful leadership development for
USAFA cadets is crucial to competent behavioral and personal characteristics that will be essential
throughout their careers as Air Force officers. The following performance measurements will be used to
collectively indicate how USAFA cadets are developing in the basics of leadership:
   5.1.1. Training cadets in the basics of leadership so the enduring leadership competencies become
   internalized behavioral and personal characteristics. These competencies will lay the intellectual
   foundation and discipline that will be essential throughout their careers.
   5.1.2. Developing cadets who aspire to leadership, both at the Academy and as commissioned offic-
   ers. Developing leaders who can continue to serve the American people with distinction and compe-
   tence in peace and in war.
   5.1.3. Fostering in each cadet an enduring commitment to the career long practice of developing air-
   men for the future. The following measures will be used:
   5A Superintendents List
   5B Outstanding Squadron System (OSS) Results
   5C Cadets Placed on Conduct/Aptitude Probation
   5D Military Review Committee (MRC) and Hearing Officer (HO) Results
   5E Operations Air Force & Equivalent Programs
   5F Graduate Active Duty Performance
   5G1 Military Performance Average--By Class
   5G2 Military Performance Average--By Group

5.2. Performance Measurement Area: Superintendent’s List. This measure reflects how many cadets
make the Superintendent’s lists (which requires making the Dean’s, Athletic Director’s and Comman-
dant’s List). Note: To ensure data is not misleading, USAFA will include the total number of applicable
cadets (i.e. a cadet may have made the List more than once).
   5.2.1. Performance Measure 5A: Superintendents List--By Class. The measure will reflect the
   number of cadets making the list, further broken down by semester and cadet class. USAFA will
   present data from the previous three semesters to show a 4-semester trend.
       5.2.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
       following the end of each semester. The report for the Spring Semester will include annual totals.
       5.2.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: >6% of the cadet population on
       Superintendent’s List. The threshold is: <4% of the cadet population on Superintendent’s List.
       5.2.1.3. Rationale. This measure indicates positive or negative trends regarding excellence in all
       aspects of cadet life.
20                                                                       AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005


5.3. Outstanding Squadron System (OSS) Results. The OSS is one indicator of how the cadets use
their leadership skills to enable their respective squadrons to achieve collective goals.
     5.3.1. Performance Measure 5B: OSS Results--By Wing. This measure presents the number of
     squadrons that have achieved an Outstanding score or received an Unsatisfactory score for each
     10-lesson period. USAFA will compare the periodic data against the 3-year average of the number of
     squadrons that achieved outstanding/unsatisfactory scores.
        5.3.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported at the end of
        each semester.
        5.3.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 0 squadrons unsatisfactory. The
        threshold is: >2 squadrons earning an unsatisfactory.
        5.3.1.3. Rationale. This indicates positive or negative trends in squadron performance.

5.4. Performance Measurement Area: Cadets Placed on Conduct and/or Aptitude Probation. T h e
number of cadets placed on conduct and/or aptitude probation is one indicator of the leadership develop-
ment of cadets.
     5.4.1. Performance Measure 5C: Cadets Placed on Conduct and/or Aptitude Probation--By
     Class. This measure presents the number of cadets placed on conduct and/or aptitude probation each
     semester by class. USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend. Note:
     To ensure data is not misleading, USAFA will include the total number of applicable cadets (i.e. a
     cadet may have been placed on probation more than once).
        5.4.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of each semester. The report for the spring semester will include annual totals.
        5.4.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: <.5% of the cadet population. The
        threshold is: >2% of the cadet population.
        5.4.1.3. Rationale. This indicates positive or negative trends in leadership development.

5.5. Performance Measurement Area: Military Review Committee and Hearing Officer Results.
The number of cadets who meet a Military Review Committee each year is one indicator of the leadership
development of cadets.
     5.5.1. Performance Measure 5D: Military Review Committee and Hearing Officer Results--By
     Wing. This measure presents the number of cadets (to include demographics) that have met a Military
     Review Committee (MRC) and/or Hearing Officer and what decision the board rendered. In addition,
     USAFA will report the number of cadets who were dismissed as a result of a MRC who had met a
     MRC previously and were retained. USAFA will also include data from the previous 4 years to show
     as 5-year trend. Note: To ensure data is not misleading, USAFA will include the total number of appli-
     cable cadets (i.e. a cadet may have met the MRC more than once).
        5.5.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of each semester. The report for the spring semester will include annual totals.
        5.5.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: <.1% of the cadet population disen-
        rolled per year. The threshold is: >.2% of the cadet population per year.
        5.5.1.3. Rationale. This indicates positive or negative trends in leadership development.
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                            21


5.6. Performance Measurement Area: Operation AIR FORCE & Equivalent Programs. Cadet par-
ticipation in the Operation AIR FORCE Program and equivalent programs (i.e., select summer research
programs and all joint programs) enhance cadet leadership development.
   5.6.1. Performance Measure 5E: Operation AIR FORCE & Equivalent Programs--Cumulative
   Days. This measure will reflect the average number of days cadets, by class, spent participating in
   Operation Air Force and other equivalent program activities (to include demographics of wing pro-
   gram participants). USAFA will include the number of cadets not meeting established goals and cadet
   feedback on the programs. USAFA will present data from the previous 3 summers to show a 4-year
   trend.
       5.6.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported once per year,
       at the end of the 3rd quarter.
       5.6.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 68 cumulative days by graduation.
       The threshold is: <50 days.
       5.6.1.3. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with an indicator of positive or
       negative trends regarding participation in Summer Program across the cadet wing.

5.7. Performance Measurement Area—Graduate Active Duty Performance. Surveys of active duty
supervisors and commanders of recent USAFA graduates is one indicator of the leadership development
of cadets.
   5.7.1. Performance Measure 5F: Graduate Active Duty Performance--By Year. E a c h               year
   supervisor and commanders of recent USAFA graduates will be surveyed to determine the quality of
   their character, education, leadership, and physical development based on each graduates performance
   as active duty officers. USAFA will send raw data to AFPC/DPA for analysis. AFPC/DPA, in turn,
   will analyze, store, and submit the results to AF/DPLA.
       5.7.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected and reported to AFPC/DPA in raw
       form. AFPC/DPA will analyze and report results annually NLT 30 days after the end of the Spring
       Semester.
       5.7.1.2. Rationale. This captures feedback from the field regarding the quality of cadet leader-
       ship development.

5.8. Performance Measurement Area--Military Performance Average (MPA). Cadet MPAs are one
indicator of the military and leadership development of cadets.
   5.8.1. Performance Measure 5G1: Military Performance Average (MPA)--By Class. This mea-
   sure presents cadet MPA, by class for each semester.
       5.8.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT
       30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
       5.8.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 2.9 MPA. The threshold is: <2.5
       MPA.
       5.8.1.3. Rationale. This may indicate institutional issues warranting further analysis.
22                                                                        AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005


5.9. Performance Measure 5G2: Military Performance Average (MPA)--By Group. This measure

                             PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT MEASURES

6.1. Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership can
assess the progress of the physical development of cadets. The following performance measures will be
used to collectively indicate how the cadets are progressing in physical development:
   6.1.1. Conducting an intensive and progressive program of physical education that achieves and sus-
   tains a high standard of physical fitness, acquisition of lifelong athletic skills and a desire to continue
   post-collegiate athletic endeavors that foster a lifelong commitment to fitness.
   6.1.2. Providing intramural, intercollegiate, and club athletic programs that entail participation by all
   cadets, contributing to a lifelong commitment to fitness, while providing leadership and character
   development opportunities and teaching them how to work in teams to achieve goals in a high stress
   environment. The following measures will be used:
   6A1 Average PFT Score By Class
   6A2 Average PFT Score Graduating Class Trend
   6A3 Average PFT Score Graduating Class Gender Trend
   6B Physical Education Review Committee
   6C Cadets Placed on Athletic Probation
   6D Physical Education Aptitude By Wing

6.2. Performance Measurement Area: Average Physical Fitness Test (PFT) Score. Average PFT
scores are indicators of the physical development of cadets. Since proficient senior cadets are not required
to take the PFT in their spring semester (they now take the Air Force Commissioning Fitness Test), Spring
semester PFT measures will consist of Spring scores for freshman, sophomore, and junior cadets and Fall
semester scores for senior cadets. Fall semester measures used for cadets unable to test in the Spring
(medical excusal, etc.). USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend.
   6.2.1. Performance Measure 6A1: Average PFT Score--By Class. This measure shows the aver-
   age PFT score for each class at the end of each semester.
       6.2.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
       following the end of each semester. The report for the Spring Semester will include annual totals.
       6.2.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: ≥350 points. The thresholds are:
       1st Class – <315 points, 2nd Class – <310 points, 3rd Class – <300 points, 4th Class – <290 points.
       6.2.1.3. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with an indicator of cadet physical
       fitness.
   6.2.2. Performance Measure 6A2: Average PFT Score for Class of 20XX--By Year. T h i s m e a -
   sure shows how the physical fitness of the graduating class (as measured by the PFT) changed
   throughout their 4 years at USAFA. Since proficient senior cadets are not required to take the PFT in
   their Spring semester (they now take the Air Force Commissioning Fitness Test), Spring semester
   PFT measures will consist of Spring scores for the freshman, sophomore, and junior years and Fall
24                                                                         AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005


     semester data for their senior year. Fall semester scores will be used for cadets unable to test in the
     spring (medical excusal, etc.). Any of these cadets who do not take the PFT during a given AY will not
     figure in the calculation for that AY, but will remain in the calculation for any other AYs in which they
     took the test.
        6.2.2.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of the Spring Semester.
        6.2.2.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: >350 points. The thresholds are:
        1st Class <315 points, 2nd Class <310 points, 3rd Class <300 points, 4th Class <290 points.
        6.2.2.3. Rationale. This measure may indicate positive or negative trends regarding cadet physi-
        cal development.
     6.2.3. Performance Measure 6A3: Average PFT Score for Class of 20XX--By Gender. T h i s
     measurement shows how the physical fitness of the graduating class, by gender, (as measured by the
     PFT) changed throughout their 4 years at USAFA. Since proficient senior cadets are not required to
     take the PFT in their Spring semester (they now take the Air Force Commissioning Fitness Test),
     Spring semester PFT measure will consist of Spring scores for the freshman, sophomore, and junior
     years and Fall scores for their senior year. Fall semester scores will be measured for cadets unable to
     test in the Spring (medical excusal, etc.). Any of these cadets who do not take the PFT during a given
     AY will not figure in the calculation for that AY, but will remain in the calculation for any other AYs
     in which they took the test.
        6.2.3.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of the Spring Semester.
        6.2.3.2. Rationale. This measure may indicate trends regarding cadet physical development.

6.3. Performance Measurement Area: Physical Education Review Committee (PERC). T h e n u m -
ber of cadets who meet the Physical Education Review Board is one indicator of the physical develop-
ment of cadets.
     6.3.1. Performance Measure 6B: Physical Education Review Committee (PERC)--By Outcome.
     This measure will present the number of cadet records that meet the PERC each year, to include the
     number of cadets disenrolled through this process. In addition, USAFA will report the number of
     cadets who were dismissed as a result of a PERC who had met a PERC previously and were retained.
     USAFA will present data from the previous 4 years to show a 5-year trend. Note: If threshold is
     exceeded, USAFA will provide the number of cadet records, by class, that met the PERC.
        6.3.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of each semester. The report for the Spring Semester will include annual totals.
        6.3.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 0 cadets meeting the PERC. The
        threshold is: >1% of the wing meet PERC annually.
        6.3.1.3. Rationale. This may indicate institutional issues warranting further analysis.

6.4. Performance Measurement Area: Cadets Placed on Athletic Probation. The number of cadets
placed on athletic probation is one indicator of the physical development of cadets.
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                              25


   6.4.1. Performance Measure 6C: Cadets Placed on Athletic Probation--By Wing. This measure
   presents number of cadets placed on probation each semester. USAFA will present data from the pre-
   vious 7 semesters to show a 4-year trend.
       6.4.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
       following the end of each semester.
       6.4.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 0 cadets on athletic probation. The
       threshold is: >10% of wing on athletic probation.
       6.4.1.3. Rationale. This measure may indicate positive or negative trends regarding cadet physi-
       cal development.

6.5. Performance Measurement Area: Physical Education Aptitude (PEA). P E A s c o r e s a r e o n e
indicator of the physical development of cadets.
   6.5.1. Performance Measure 6D: Physical Education Aptitude (PEA)--By Wing. This measure
   presents the physical fitness/athletic aptitude of cadets for the academic year. USAFA will present
   data from the previous 7 semesters to show a 4-year trend.
       6.5.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
       following the end of the Spring Semester.
       6.5.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: >30% of cadet wing with >3.0
       PEA. The thresholds are: <10% of cadet wing with >3.0 PEA.
       6.5.1.3. Rationale. This measure may indicate positive or negative trends in cadet physical devel-
       opment overall.

                                                 Chapter 7

                               GENERAL GOVERNANCE MEASURES

7.1. Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership can
assess the progress of activities that don’t directly assess cadet development. The following performance
measurements will be used collectively to indicate progress in the general governance of USAFA and are
intended to measure how USAFA accomplishes the following:
     7.1.1. Organize and employ personnel, equipment, communications, and facilities as necessary to
     accomplish the USAFA mission through effective planning, directing and controlling of USAFA per-
     sonnel and operations. The following measures will be used:
     7A USAFA Attrition
     7B Honor Cases Processing Times
     7C Faculty and Staff Demographics
     7D Permanent Party Climate Survey
     7E Voluntary Disenrollment
     7F Medical Turn-back
     7G Administrative Turn-back
     7H Significant Event Reporting
     7I OSI Investigation Timeliness
     7J Tour Lengths

7.2. Performance Measurement Area: Annual Attrition. Attrition trend data provides indicators that
enable USAFA to narrowly define cadet dynamics requiring leadership attention.
     7.2.1. Performance Measure 7A: Annual Attrition--By Class. This measure presents attrition
     rates of each class by category of Basic Cadet Training (BCT), Voluntary, and Involuntary. Data pre-
     sented for the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st Classes will reflect cumulative data since the beginning of their Basic
     Cadet Training period. USAFA will include provide demographic data (e.g. gender, American Indian
     or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or
     Latino) pertaining to attrition rates to provide a fuller picture for leadership. USAFA will present data
     from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend.
        7.2.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
        following the end of each semester. The report for the Spring Semester will include annual totals.
        7.2.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: <25% cumulative, by class. The
        thresholds are: 4th Class >11%, 3rd class >6%, 2nd Class >5%, 1st Class >3%.
        7.2.1.3. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with positive or negative trends
        regarding attrition.
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                                  27


7.3. Performance Measurement Area: Honor Case Processing Times. Processing time of honor
cases is one indicator of the governance of the Honor System. The goal is 60-days total processing from
the time, after clarification, that a cadet is alleged to have violated the honor code until the case is com-
pleted. Completion is defined as the time when final decision is reached by the appropriate USAFA
authority.
   7.3.1. Performance Measure 7B: Honor Cases Processing Times--By Wing. This measure pre-
   sents the average processing time of honor cases each month, as well as a summary of every case that
   exceeded 90 days. USAFA will present data from the 2 previous years to show a 3-year trend.
NOTE: USAFA will also provide present the average processing time of disenrollment cases each
month.
       7.3.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported quarterly. In
       addition, USAFA will submit a monthly report to SAF/MRM showing any case currently over 90
       days along with an explanation for the excessive processing time, and a projection for completion
       of each case. If no honor cases exceed the 90-day limit, no monthly report to SAF/MRM is
       required.
       7.3.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: all cases processed in ≤60 days.
       The threshold is: 1 or more cases taking ≥90 days to process.
       7.3.1.3. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with positive or negative trends
       regarding the efficiency of the honor system.

7.4. Performance Measurement Area: Faculty and Staff Demographics. Maintaining a healthy mix
of backgrounds on the USAFA faculty and Staff could be important to the overall development of cadets.
   7.4.1. Performance Measure 7C: Faculty and Staff Demographics. This measure presents the
   percent of the USAFA Faculty and Staff (excluding 10 ABW personnel) that are AFA graduates/
   non-AFA graduates, minorities (e.g. American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African
   American, Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino) /non-minorities, male/female, and
   rated/non rated, civilian faculty (not retired military)/civilian faculty (retired military). USAFA will
   present data from the 3 previous years to show a 4-year trend.
       7.4.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 days
       following the end of the Spring Semester.
       7.4.1.2. Rationale. This may indicate institutional issues warranting further analysis.

7.5. Performance Measurement Area: Permanent Party Survey Results. One indication of the suc-
cess of the governance of USAFA is the results of the annual survey of permanent party members.
   7.5.1. Performance Measure 7D: Permanent Party Climate Survey--By Year. This measure pre-
   sents the complete results and analysis for the annual permanent party survey. The survey is a tool to
   enhance USAFA leaderships’ ability to rapidly identify and correct root causes of misperceptions or
   negative organizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions. Consequently, the indicators revealed
   by the survey require further exploration by USAFA leadership. The annual climate survey will be
   conducted IAW AFI 36-2706. USAFA will send raw data to AFPC/DPA for analysis. AFPC/DPA, in
   turn, will analyze, store, and submit the results to AF/DPLA. To ensure perceptions of minorities are
   not overlooked, data should not be presented using an “80% positive – 20% negative rule” as a gauge
28                                                                        AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005


     (i.e. minority groups (e.g. American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American,
     Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino) tend to make up less than 20% of the popula-
     tion). Do not use percentages (present the actual number of cadets/survey responses) when presenting
     data pertaining to zero tolerance policies (e.g. unlawful discrimination, hostile environment, sexual
     harassment/assault etc.). Include a sample of both positive and negative comments with statistical data
     for each category of questions to enhance leadership insight into perceptions. Provide root causes of
     misperceptions or negative organizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions identified after fur-
     ther exploration of indicators, corrective measures taken, and the method leadership used to close the
     feedback loop with permanent party.
        7.5.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected and reported to AFPC/DPA in raw
        form. AFPC/DPA will analyze and report results annually NLT 30 days after the end of the Spring
        Semester.
        7.5.1.2. Rationale. This measure may provide indicators that lead to root causes of mispercep-
        tions or negative organizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions. It also may indicate the
        need for adjustments in leadership's response to indicators.

7.6. Performance Measurement Area: Voluntary Disenrollment. The desire of cadets to depart the
Academy of their own volition can be an indication of management of USAFA, and USAFA responses to
various cases could provoke analysis that may identify issues not otherwise apparent.
     7.6.1. Performance Measure 7E: Voluntary Disenrollment--By Class. This measure presents the
     raw numbers for voluntary disenrollment, by class, and may include the former cadet’s rationale for
     leaving.
        7.6.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually.
        7.6.1.2. Rationale. This may indicate areas within USAFA requiring additional exploration.

7.7. Performance Measurement Area: Medical Turn-back. In the course of the USAFA program,
some cadets develop medical conditions affecting their ability to successfully participate in Academy
activities. Those cadets who desire to complete their education with USAFA but need time to recover are
turned-back medically. The number of cadets in medical turn-back status and the reason why can be an
indication of management of USAFA, and USAFA responses to various cases could provoke analysis that
may identify issues not otherwise apparent.
     7.7.1. Performance Measure 7F: Medical Turn-back--By Reason. This measure presents raw
     numbers of cadets who have been medically turned back, by reason for the turn back (injury, preg-
     nancy, etc.)
        7.7.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT
        30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
        7.7.1.2. Rationale. This may indicate areas within USAFA requiring additional exploration.

7.8. Performance Measurement Area: Administrative Turn-back. In the course of completing the
rigors of the USAFA program, some cadets are administratively turned back. Those cadets who desire to
complete their education with USAFA but need time to address other issues are turned-back administra-
tively. The number of cadets in administrative turn-back status and the reason why can be an indication of
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                               29


management of USAFA, and USAFA responses to various cases could provoke analysis that may identify
issues not otherwise apparent.
   7.8.1. Performance Measure 7G: Administrative Turn-back--By Reason. This measure presents
   raw numbers of cadets who have been administratively turned back, by reason for the turn back (fam-
   ily emergency, hardship, etc.)
       7.8.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT
       30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
       7.8.1.2. Rationale. This may indicate areas within USAFA requiring additional exploration.

7.9. Performance Measurement Area: Significant Incident Reporting. It is imperative senior Air
Force leaders are informed of significant incidents in a timely manner.
   7.9.1. Performance Measure 7H: Significant Incident Reporting. This measure presents the
   amount of time that transpires when anyone in the USAFA chain of command becomes aware of a
   significant incident until either the SecAF or CSAF have been notified.
       7.9.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported on a quarterly
       basis.
       7.9.1.2. Rationale. This measure will indicate positive or negative trends in
       USAFA’s senior leader notification process.

7.10. Performance Measurement Area: OSI Investigation Times. OSI investigations must be accom-
plished in a timely manner to enhance USAFA leadership efforts to instill good order and discipline.
   7.10.1. Performance Measure 7I: OSI Investigation Times. OSI will track and report the elapsed
   time from the moment OSI is notified of an incident that requires investigation until the report of the
   investigation is delivered to USAFA leadership.
       7.10.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported on an annual
       basis.
       7.10.1.2. Rationale. This measure will indicate positive or negative trends in
       OSI investigation timeliness.

7.11. Performance Measurement Area: Tour Lengths. USAFA tour lengths should be limited to pre-
vent the Academy from being insulated from the operational Air Force and a broader range of experiences
and perspectives. This measure will include all Sequential Tour Officers (STO) and Permanent Profes-
sors.
   7.11.1. Performance Measure 7J: Tour Lengths. This measure presents the number of enlisted
   personnel with over 4 years time on station and the number of officers with over 3 years time on sta-
   tion at USAFA.
       7.11.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT
       30 days following the end of the Spring Semester.
       7.11.1.2. Rationale. This measure will indicate positive or negative trends regarding success of
       measures to prevent USAFA from being insulated from the operational Air Force.

                           USAFA PREPARATORY SCHOOL MEASURES

8.1. Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership can
assess the accomplishment of the USAFA Preparatory School mission. The following performance mea-
surements will be used collectively to indicate progress and maximize USAFA effectiveness:
     8.1.1. Motivating, preparing, and evaluating selected candidates in an academic, military, moral, and
     physical environment, to perform successfully at USAFA. The following measures will be used:
     8A Preparatory School Admission of Selected Groups--By Prep School Class Year
     8B USAFA Entry Rate of Prep School Graduates--By USAFA Class Year
     8C USAFA Entrance Rate of Selected Preparatory School Groups--By USAFA Class Year
     8D USAFA Graduation--Prep School vs. Direct Entry--By USAFA Class Year

8.2. Performance Measurement Area: Preparatory School Admissions. The admissions information
is one indicator of the ability of USAFA to achieve its mission
     8.2.1. Performance Measure 8A: Preparatory School Admission of Selected Groups--By Prep
     School Class Year. This measure presents the percentage of the incoming Prep School Cadets candi-
     dates by the following categories: Prior Service, Minorities, Women and Recruited Athletes. USAFA
     will present data from the 3 previous years to show 4-year trend.
        8.2.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT end of
        third quarter, once per year.
        8.2.1.2. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with trends in the prep school
        admissions process.

8.3. Performance Measure Area: Prep School to USAFA Entrance Ratio. The percentage of Prep
School students that eventually enter USAFA is an indicator of the success of the Prep School mission.
     8.3.1. Performance Measure 8B: USAFA Entry Rate of Prep School Graduates--By USAFA
     Class Year. This measure presents the percent of Prep School students who start as cadets at USAFA.
     The percentage is determined by taking the number of Prep School students that start USAFA training
     divided by the number of Prep School students in the Prep School entrance class. USAFA will present
     data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend.
        8.3.1.1. Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT end of
        third quarter, once per year.
        8.3.1.2. Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 70%. The threshold is: <67% but
        not >80%.
        8.3.1.3. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with the entrance ratio for prep
        school attendees. This information may indicate strengths or areas for improvement in the prep
        school program.
AFI36-3502 10 MARCH 2005                                                                            31


8.4. Performance Measurement Area: Prep School to USAFA Entrance Rate--By Groups. Admis-
sions information is one indicator of the ability of USAFA to achieve its mission
   8.4.1. Performance Measure 8C: USAFA Entrance Rate of Selected Preparatory School
   Groups--By USAFA Class Year. This measure presents the percentage of each specific group of Prep
   School cadets (e.g. women, minorities, prior-service, athletes) admitted to USAFA. USAFA will
   present data from the 3 previous years to show 4-year trend.
       8.4.1.1. Reporting Requirement. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT end of
       third quarter, once per year.
       8.4.1.2. Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with trends in the admissions pro-
       cess.

8.5. Performance Measurement Area: USAFA Graduation Rate--Preparatory School vs. Direct
Entry. One indicator of the accomplishment of the Prep School mission is the rate at which Prep School
students graduate from USAFA, as compared to the rate at which non-Prep School USAFA cadets gradu-
ate.
   8.5.1. Performance Measure 8D: USAFA Graduation--Prep School vs. Direct Entry--By
   USAFA Class Year. This measure presents the graduation rate of Prep School students from USAFA,
   and compares it to the graduation rate of USAFA cadets who entered USAFA directly. USAFA will

          SUMMARY-AT-A-GLANCE REPORT AND PERFORMANCE THRESHOLDS

9.1. Purpose. To provide a quick summary to top AF leadership of the status of the accomplishment of
the USAFA mission by providing a color-coded visual chart reflecting the positive and/or negative trends.

9.2. Summary-at-a-Glance Report. The Summary-at-a-Glance Report will consist of the charts below,
and will be developed and submitted during each reporting period. The information to be included in each
submittal is depicted in the charts below. The appropriate color will be determined by referencing the
thresholds in paragraph 9.3. Where no threshold would be applicable to a category, or law prevents a goal/
threshold, there will be no associated color. For each of the measures, a pictorial chart must be submitted
along with the Summary at a Glance Report, so that each level of leadership is provided with detailed
information on the measurement if they choose to “drill down” into an issue.
