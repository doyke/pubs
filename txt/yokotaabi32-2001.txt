                         ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

1.1. Program Objective.
     1.1.1. The Fire Protection and Prevention Program ensures that the mission of Yokota AB is
     not impaired by fire. To reach this objective, we must eliminate the potential causes of fire,
     reduce the loss of life, injuries, property damage, and protect the environment should a fire
     occur. In order for people to support an aggressive fire prevention program, they must be
     knowledgeable in the elimination of fire hazards and fire reporting procedures. This
     knowledge can minimize and reduce injury and monetary loss if a fire occurs. This is done
     through the education of all personnel, command support at all levels, and enforcement of
     safe practices. Therefore, fire prevention and fire safety issues will not be compromised for
     reason of expediency or economy.
     1.1.2. Carelessness is the leading cause of fire. All personnel shall observe preventive
     measures. Unit Commanders and Supervisors will enforce this instruction as it pertains to
     their units and will take appropriate administrative or disciplinary action in cases of willful
     misconduct or negligence involving fire prevention policies and fire loss to government
     property.
1.2. Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).

of an activity or operation. This individual usually can acquire and commit resources of the
abatement of occupational safety and health hazards. Functional Managers are designated by the
MAJCOM or installation commanders.
Handling—To act or perform a required function with regard to a specific object or process.
