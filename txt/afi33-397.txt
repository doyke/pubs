1. Overview:
     1.1. In conjunction with homeland security, Air Force initiated the purchase of explosive
     trace detection scanners to provide defense in depth (layered security) for all overseas
     locations and key CONUS locations. These scanners are state-of-the-art technology; they are
     ideal for screening mail for explosives and gunpowder. They are also instrumental in locating
     chemical and radioactive “dirty” bombs, since those devices also contain an explosive
     component for them to be effective. The current inventory includes the IONSCAN system.
     However, similar systems may be added to the inventory in the future.
     1.2. Although there is no specific threat of terrorist mail attacks at Air Force installations,
     there is still a need to establish procedures and solutions that installations will implement as
     Force Protection Conditions (FPCON) elevate, or in the event of a specific threat. The
     purpose of a mail-screening program is to safeguard personnel, property, and resources
     during day-to-day postal operations, deter terrorist threats, enhance security, and assign
     responsibilities.
     1.3. Implementing protective measures should enhance the antiterrorism (AT) posture of the
     installation, but has inherent limitations. Screening can be accomplished for a percentage of
     mail (paragraph 2.1.10.), but screening 100 percent of all daily mail may not be feasible for
     extended periods without personnel augmentation. The use of the IONSCAN is designed to
     supplement visual screening procedures, not replace them. Assigned personnel must
     understand they are the first line of defense against terrorists and their acts. Employees must
     remain vigilant when it comes to personal security and the security of the work place.
     1.4. The IONSCAN system consists of four main equipment items, all are important to the
     systems continued performance: IONSCAN, printer (label-type), sampling wand, and heavy-
     duty aluminum shipping case.
NOTE: The shipping case is important for protecting the scanner when depot-level maintenance
is required. However, long periods between usages can lead to its misplacement. Take steps to
ensure shipping case remains in proximity to the scanner and identified for this sole purpose.

2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. Senior government representative (or postal contractor), assigned to each Air Force mail
   entry point or other major mail processing facility will:
       2.1.1. Ensure individuals who operate IONSCAN equipment receive and successfully
       complete appropriate training before operating the equipment. Ensure training records for
       military, government civilian, and contractor employees are properly documented.
       2.1.2. Conduct annual refresher training to ensure all personnel are current in procedures
       and actions required in the event of positive readings.
       2.1.3. Ensure Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and other first responder personnel
       are aware of the scanner’s location and familiar with its operation.
       2.1.4. Ensure operators understand the procedures for handling mail determined to be
       suspicious or hazardous and implement suspicious mail procedures (See Attachment 2 for
       suspicious-mail procedures).
       2.1.5. Develop screening standards to minimize the potential of mail entry points
       becoming the “soft spot” in installation defense. Ensure mail is screened according to
       priority, on a daily basis, and as soon as possible upon arrival. If suspicious mail is found,
       the operator will immediately notify the senior person on-duty, who will notify
       appropriate officials. (See Attachment 2 for suspicious-mail procedures.)
       2.1.6. Ensure equipment is used in accordance with manufacturer’s guidelines, and
       required maintenance procedures are followed.
       2.1.7. Monitor consumable parts and supply replacement program.
NOTE: Installations must fund purchase of consumable supplies. Budget approximately $1000
annually per IONSCAN. Supply sources are listed on Air Force Postal SharePoint located at
https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-SC-PO-ST/.
       2.1.8. Register each IONSCAN with the Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO)
       and Bioenvironmental Engineer.
       2.1.9. Screen 100% of suspicious mail, mail received from foreign country postal
       systems, and mail destined for billets or personnel identified as “high-risk”. See
       suspicious-mail procedures in Attachment 2.
       2.1.10. Consult with local security forces unit and, using the local design basis threat and
       completed integrated defense risk management process, determine most effective use of
       the explosive detector systems. However, as a minimum conduct random daily scanning
       based on the current FPCON:
(NOTE: Installations will increase percentages to address specific threats.)
           2.1.10.1. FPCON Normal, randomly scan 10 percent of incoming mail.
           2.1.10.2. FPCON Alpha, randomly scan 20 percent of incoming mail.
           2.1.10.3. FPCON Bravo, randomly scan 30 percent of incoming mail, begin target
           scanning for high-risk billets and personnel at 100 percent.
 4                                                              AFI33-397 9 JANUARY 2014


           2.1.10.4. FPCON Charlie, randomly scan 50 percent of incoming mail, and continue
           target scanning for high-risk billets and personnel at 100 percent.
           2.1.10.5. FPCON Delta, scan 100 percent of incoming mail.
       2.1.11. Immediately contact warranty contractor’s helpdesk to resolve system errors.
           2.1.11.1. Authorized Shipping Modes. CONUS locations will use FedEx or UPS
           Ground shipping with mandatory signature and tracking. OCONUS locations will use
           Registered Mail, Diplomatic Pouch, or “bird watch” shipments to ensure positive
           control of the IONSCAN. Express Mail is also authorized but must be used sparingly
           due to expense.
           2.1.11.2. Ensure device is protected from damage during shipment by utilizing
           appropriate shipping container.
       2.1.12. Required logbook entries are daily startup and maintenance procedures
       (attachment 3) and completion of the weekly maintenance procedures (attachment 4), and
       any supplies ordered.
       2.1.13. The IONSCAN contains a radioactive material (RAM) (Ni-63) within a
       sealed component, never open or remove the sealed component containing the
       RAM.
       2.1.14. Coordinate with the Bioenvironmental Engineer to perform leak tests of the
       IONSCAN every 6 months. Test results must be documented and maintained for three
       years in accordance with Records Disposition Schedule.
       2.1.15. Ensure the IONSCAN is placed on the unit’s equipment account (CA/CRL) in a
       timely manner. Use ASC Code 006E000 and stock number 6665P6811066 to account for
       the machines.
       2.1.16. Ensure the IONSCAN is not transferred to or from another party without
       permission of the Bioenvironmental Engineer (or IRSO) and the MAJCOM OMM.
       Ensure the IONSCAN is issued as a “generally licensed device” IAW AFI 40-20,
       Managing Radioactive Materials in the U.S. Air Force. MAJCOM OMM will notify AF
       OMM of any transfer request, no transfer will be completed until AF OMM approval is
       received.
       2.1.17. Ensure written approval is received from the Bioenvironmental Engineer or
       IRSO, and all procedures are strictly adhered to before initiating any steps to acquire
       additional IONSCAN machines.
NOTE: Due to the high cost of funding the warranty program, HQ USAF will not fund standby
or reserve machines. Only machines in daily use will have their warranty funded. Locations with
unused machines will identity them to the AF OMM for redistribution.
       2.1.18. Contact the Bioenvironmental Engineer within 2 hours of receipt of an
       IONSCAN. Place the unopened package in a secure storage location while awaiting
       further directions from the Bioenvironmental Engineer.
       2.1.19. Do not move the IONSCAN from its appointed location at the mail entry point,
       unless approved by the MAJCOM OMM.
AFI33-397 9 JANUARY 2014                                                                         5


       2.1.20. Ensure personnel understand the private nature of personal mail and information
       concerning personal mail may not be divulged outside of postal channels except for
       safety purposes (DoD 4525.6-M, Chapter 10).
       2.1.21. For mail entry points that are “outsourced” or utilizing contract employees, the
       contract's work statement shall require compliance with these policies and procedures and
       any subsequent changes thereto. The contract's quality assurance surveillance plan shall
       be designed to make sure the contractor complies with this instruction.
3. Training:
   3.1. Formal training will address two aspects—attaining the skills required to operate the
   IONSCAN and maintaining currency in those skills.
   3.2. The senior government official or postal contractor assigned to the mail entry point will:
       3.2.1. Oversee all clerk training (personnel must complete the IONSCAN 400B Dual
       Mode Interactive Training Module).
       3.2.2. Provide basic troubleshooting instructions through demonstrations and simulated
       equipment errors.
       3.2.3. Provide annual refresher training.

4. Leak Testing:
   4.1. The IONSCAN must be leak tested every 6 months to ensure the continued integrity of
   the source and to verify no RAM has leaked. In addition, if the unit is physically damaged, it
   must be leak tested (and those results known) before it is returned to service. The base
   Bioenvironmental Engineer will perform this activity.
   4.2. Test results must be documented and maintained for three years per the RDS.
5. Repair and Technical Support.
   5.1. Repairs will be accomplished by contracted warranty support.
   5.2. Coordinate with the warranty contractor via their 24/7 helpdesk phone number. Contact
   and shipping requirements information is maintained current on the Air Force Postal
   SharePoint.
   5.3. Warranty contractor helpdesk personnel will assist with system diagnostic, send
   operator installable replacement parts, or provide return authorization number if depot-level
   repairs are required.
NOTE: HQ USAF centrally funds the warranty contract. However, Installations must fund
shipping cost to repair depot when depot-level maintenance is required. Contractor will fund
shipping to return the repaired scanner.
   5.4. Notify the Bioenvironmental Engineering and your MAJCOM OMM whenever an
   IONSCAN is inoperative or removed from service.
 6                                                            AFI33-397 9 JANUARY 2014


     5.5. MAJCOM OMM will notify AF OMM of any IONSCAN machines removed from
     service.
6. IONSCAN Turn-in. Installations will not turn-in to Supply or otherwise dispose of an
assigned IONSCAN. Locations will request disposition instructions from MAJCOM OMM, who
will coordinate with the Air Force Official Mail Manager (OMM) to reassign the IONSCAN to
another mail entry point. Losing installations will fund shipment to gaining location. Always
coordinate moves with your servicing Bioenvironmental Engineer.

    DAILY STARTUP AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES FOR THE IONSCAN

A3.1. Startup and Maintenance Procedures:
   A3.1.1. Ensure your hands are clean and surfaces have been cleaned with isopropyl alcohol
   of 70 percent or greater.
   A3.1.2. Check Drierite®, ensuring the color is blue and at least up to the seam on the tube.
   Approximately 2 cm of blue charcoal is required to start a shift. Cartridge will need to be
   changed once Drierite® has turned pink to 1cm above charcoal.
   A3.1.3. Check for proper installation of Drierite® quick disconnect fittings, located on
   Drierite® cartridge to unit hoses.
   A3.1.4. Visually inspect the air filters and only remove them if they must be cleaned. Clean
   filters with compressed air or simply pat clean taking care not to tear the filter. Heavily
   soiled filters can be rinsed with water but must be completely dry before replacing.”
   A3.1.5. Clean the swipe tray and Teflon ring with a clean paper towel wipe dampened with
   isopropyl alcohol of 70 percent or greater.
   A3.1.6. Prior to turning on the IONSCAN, remove the high temperature cover to access the
   Desorber heater and inlet area. If cleaning after using the IONSCAN, the system must be
   cooled to room temperature to avoid damage.
   A3.1.7. Clean the top of the desorber heater and bottom of the inlet with a cotton swab
   dampened with isopropyl alcohol of 70 percent or greater.
   A3.1.8. Visually inspect the exhaust condenser tube at the top of the unit; must be replaced if
   sponge upstream from arrows has turned off white.
   A3.1.9. Reinstall the high temperature cover.
   A3.1.10. Turn the switch at the back of unit to the ON position.
   A3.1.11. Check the lights on the front panel and ensure the yellow standby and green ready
   lights are on.
   A3.1.12. Wait for the “beep”, and then press the ready/standby key. The green ready light
   will begin to flash on and off.
   A3.1.13. Wait for the IONSCAN to warm up, which could take 15 minutes or more. The
   green “ready” light will remain constantly on, followed by a short beep. The IONSCAN is
   now ready to begin the sampling process.
   A3.1.14. Run a blank analysis by sliding the empty slide tray to the analysis position. If the
   Pressure Auto Adjust warning message appears press “ENTER” to clear the message.
   Repeat the blank analysis until the message no longer appears. If the blank sample
   consistently alarms, clean the desorber heater, Teflon ring, and swipe tray with a cotton swab
   dipped in isopropyl alcohol of 70 percent or greater. A few passes may be needed in order to
   burn off all impurities.
   A3.1.15. Run blank samples until you get two consecutive passes.
 12                                                               AFI33-397 9 JANUARY 2014


   A3.1.16. Place a clean cotton swipe or swab in the swipe tray. The cotton swipe must have 2
   passes within 10 attempts in order to begin the verification process. The readings do not have
   to be from consecutive passes.
   A3.1.17. Sign the verific printed receipt and record the results in a logbook (operational
   time, total samples run to date, your name, Drierite® level, calibrant level, and
   autocalibration and bakeout processes).
   A3.1.18. If you do not see a verific alarm, repeat the process a second time.
   A3.1.19. If you fail to see a verific alarm after the second attempt, wait 15 minutes and try a
   third test. Make sure the variability or ∆ (Delta) is within specifications (± 50 μsec from the
   peak position). The most accurate IONSCAN readings are given if the calibrant level is
   closest to absolute zero.
   A3.1.20. If verification cannot be performed successfully and autocalibration is available
   (YES/ NAPP), perform autocalibration (accessed through “function menu”).
   A3.1.21. To perform an autocalibration, place a swab w/verific lipstick on it into the slide
   tray and move tray to the right for analyzing. After a successful autocalibration, press the
   Save Exit and then Esc function keys and proceed doing a verific using the verification
   lipstick to obtain a verific alarm. After you obtain a verific alarm, press the ALARM RESET
   button, and thoroughly clean the area with 70% or better isopropyl alcohol. Sign the verific
   printed receipt and record the results in the logbook.
NOTE. Should be rare to use autocalibration. If you need to use autocalibration on a daily basis,
system is not operating properly. Check Drierite® level and ensure IONSCAN is clean.
   A3.1.22. Once you get a verific alarm, discard the swab used in the verific alarm process.
   A3.1.23. Check your hands and the scanner surfaces to ensure they are not contaminated.
   A3.1.24. Place a clean cotton swipe or swab in the swipe tray. Make sure to handle cotton
   swab by the edges and avoid touching the middle of the swab were sample is collected. The
   cotton swipe must have 2 passes within 10 attempts in order to begin the verific process. The
   readings do not need to be consecutive passes. (If you continue to get a verific alarm, be sure
   to slide the swipe tray to the right to burn off any impurities on the Teflon gasket.) If alarms
   persist after 5 blank analyses contact Smiths Detection service department.
   A3.1.25. Proceed to test your work area and the letters or packages. (A swab is good for
   approximately 30 applications or until visibly dirty.)
   A3.1.26. Make sure the logbook is annotated daily.
   A3.1.27. Corrective actions for a positive alarm are as follows:
       A3.1.27.1. Run another sample. If it still tests positive, inform your supervisor.
       A3.1.27.2. Ensure your hands are clean and scanner surfaces have been cleaned with an
       isopropyl alcohol wipe of 70 percent or greater. Make sure the integrity of the system is
       maintained by performing the aforementioned methodology. If tests still result in a
       positive alarm, inform the proper authorities.
