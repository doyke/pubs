   MANAGEMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, NUCLEAR COMPONENTS, AND
                          SPARES

2.1. Management of Nuclear Weapons.
   2.1.1. Broad guidance on nuclear weapon stockpile quantities is provided by various
   documents (i.e. START I, Presidential Decision Directives, Nuclear Posture Review, etc.).
   The DoD and DOE prepare, coordinate, and deliver the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile
   Memorandum (NWSM), which contains the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Plan (NWSP), to
   the President. The President then signs a NWSP which directs quantities and types of
   nuclear weapons in the active and inactive stockpile. The President, through the SECDEF
   and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, entrusts the stockpile to various Services for
   employment as requested/directed by combatant commanders (e.g. USSTRATCOM,
   EUCOM), based on their missions and use in execution of war plans.

supplement Quality Assurance guidance identified in AFI 21-200 as they apply to specific unit
mission.
   3.4.1. Certification, as used here, is a term that applies to nuclear weapons maintenance,
   mate/demate, handling, and final assembly test operations. The certification program is a
AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013                                                               21


   requirement over and above the qualification and certification procedures contained in AFI
   36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and AFI 36-2232, Maintenance Training, and takes
   precedence over all other publications in the area of nuclear weapons certification and
   evaluation.
       3.4.1.1. The objective of the certification program is threefold:
          3.4.1.1.1. To ensure all certifications are conducted using nuclear weapons trainers.
          3.4.1.1.2. To ensure non-certified technicians are not permitted to perform nuclear
          weapons tasks (maintenance, mate/demate, handling, and final assembly checkout) on
          WR weapons.
          3.4.1.1.3. To ensure technicians performing nuclear weapons tasks understand and
          use proper technical data, maintenance procedures, and techniques.
       3.4.1.2. Additionally, the weapons maintenance supervisory certification program is used
       to identify supervisors, who are authorized to intervene when a rejectable component or
       weapon is encountered or to evaluate any unknown or unusual weapon or major
       component condition.
          3.4.1.2.1. Authorizations. Supervisory certification allows supervisors appointed
          IAW paragraph 1.4.4.9 to intervene when a rejectable component or weapon is
          encountered or to evaluate any unknown or unusual weapon or major component
          condition. It allows them to determine if it is safe to continue an operation after
          rejection of a component or weapon. It also allows them to handle, manipulate, and
          inspect weapons, components, the weapon system, equipment, tools, etc. when
          assessing/validating condition/status or otherwise provide assistance.
          3.4.1.2.2. Limitations. Personnel who possess only supervisory certification may not
          perform nuclear weapon certified technical operations in the team member or team
          chief position.
   3.4.2. Technicians must have completed weapons academic training, applicable safety
   training, and be JQS task qualified prior to task certification.
   3.4.3. Certification is limited to those items on which the technician is qualified.
3.5. Certifying Officials. (For tasks identified in paragraph 3.8).
   3.5.1. The 2WX7X and 2M07X QA are nuclear weapons certifying officials by virtue of
   position. If necessary, the MX/SUPT may appoint, in writing, additional technically
   qualified certifying officials for the following tasks: 2M052 for RS mate/demate and
   weapons handling tasks. 2M07X for launcher/pylon tests, select mate/demate tasks, and
   weapons handling tasks. 2WX71 for weapons handling tasks. 2W271 for weapons
   maintenance, mate/demate, handling, and Reentry System Test Set (RSTS) / Safety
   Enhanced Reentry Vehicle Field Test Set (SFTS) checkout tasks.
   3.5.2. Personnel assigned Certifying Official responsibilities as defined in this AFI will be
   JQS qualified on the specific nuclear weapons, weapons systems, nuclear reporting, CDS,
   and Permissive Action Link (PAL) procedures as they apply to the task being evaluated. The
   individual must be capable of accurately observing job performance and identifying
   deviation from established standards.
22                                                    AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013


  3.5.3. Prior to performing certifications, the QA superintendent, Chief Inspector, MX/SUPT,
  or Flight Commander/Flight Chief will ensure Certifying Officials are JQS qualified on the
  task to be evaluated and have a current Evaluator Proficiency Evaluation (EPE) while
  performing a personnel evaluation. All certifying officials must receive a semiannual EPE
  on a personnel evaluation. If a certifying official is overdue the semiannual personnel EPE,
  the individual is restricted from performing certifications or personnel evaluations until
  another EPE is completed.
     3.5.3.1. QA will maintain initial and current EPE documentation for all certifying
     officials.
  3.5.4. Certifying Officials will not certify themselves.
  3.5.5. Certifications will only be accomplished while observing actual task performance.
  Certifying Officials will not be part of the task being performed.
  3.5.6. Certify technicians to perform or direct nuclear weapons maintenance, mate/demate,
  and final assembly checkout tasks as TC, TM, Work Cage (WC), Diving Board (DB), or Top
  Side (TS). Technicians certified in the TC position may perform as TMs. Technicians must
  perform the entire operation, to include all documentation required for the task.
  3.5.7. Certify technicians to perform transfer and transport tasks. All personnel certified on
  transfer and transport tasks must be able to demonstrate proficiency in all tasks areas that
  individual is qualified to perform. This includes use and application of all associated
  technical data.
  3.5.8. Certify weapons maintenance tasks by weapon type and task performed (e.g. B61
  General Maintenance (GM), B61 LLCE, etc.).
  3.5.9. Separate certification is not required for nose and tail removals; LLC removal;
  Parachute (PC) removal; weapon demate from launch gear and equipment; demate RV; RV
  disassembly; demate aft shroud; or RS demate from MGS, provided individual is certified on
  the applicable installation, mate, or assembly procedure and is appropriately JQS qualified.
  3.5.10. CDS recodes, activation, and Strike Enable Plug (SEP) removal or installation do not
  require certification. Individuals need be JQS qualified only.
  3.5.11. PAL/CMS TMs do not require certification but training must be documented in the
  CFETP. PAL TMs are authorized to open and close access doors, connect/disconnect
  PAL/CMS cables and adapters, and perform visual monitors provided these items are
  included in PAL/CMS training.
  3.5.12. Personnel involved in a one-time handling and movement of non-assigned weapons
  such as PNAF contingency, DOE SAFE HAVENs, etc., must be transfer and or transport
  certified and qualified to operate required equipment (tow vehicle, forklift, etc.) needed to
  support the mission. Technicians do not require JQS qualification on non-assigned weapons.
  This is the only exception to normal nuclear weapons certification and JQS qualification
  requirements. Personnel involved in a one-time handling and movement of non-assigned
  weapons must have current technical data available and they must review and understand the
  procedures prior to operation.
AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013                                                                23


3.6. Certification Requirements.
   3.6.1. Weapons maintenance, mate/demate, handling, and final assembly checkout task
   certifications will be performed using the following guidelines:
      3.6.1.1. Certifications may involve any procedures that are authorized to be performed
      by that certification IAW paragraph 3.8 of this instruction. Certifying officials should
      vary what is demonstrated from certification to certification and limit “standard
      certifications” as much as possible to prevent technicians from being “trained for the
      certification.”
      3.6.1.2. Abbreviated operations for the purposes of recertifying personnel are not
      authorized. Additionally, multiple TC certifications must be performed as separate,
      complete start-to-finish operations (i.e. one TC will not disassemble the weapon and a
      second TC reassemble it).
      3.6.1.3. All certifications will include a sufficient number of written injected defects and
      written scenarios to provide the certifying official an accurate assessment of the scope
      and completeness of training and the crew’s proficiency during actual task performance.
      Certifying officials will avoid an excessive number of injects during the evaluation. The
      number of injects per certification will be coordinated through MX/SUPT and spelled out
      in the Quality Assurance Plan.
          3.6.1.3.1. Injects will focus on the crew’s ability to react to emergency situations,
          detect and properly evaluate defects, and their in-depth knowledge of all technical
          data procedures applicable to that certification.
          3.6.1.3.2. Each GM and LLCE TC certification will involve at least one inject UR
          against the weapon to verify the crew’s ability to generate accurate reports.
      3.6.1.4. A certification is considered a normal evaluation in regards to all the evaluation
      rules provided in AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management, with the
      exception that certifications will not be counted against QA’s required Proficiency
      Evaluation (PE) totals in the QA database. All certifications will be scored and
      documented as “Non-Rated” tasks regardless of whether or not it was a pass or fail
      certification. Follow established Group routing procedures for certification reports.
          3.6.1.4.1. Certification attempts that are not successful will be treated as training
          operations and documented as a non-rated evaluation. The evaluation will not be
          scored against established inspection and evaluation requirements.
          3.6.1.4.2. A separate PE will be scored on certified personnel who are on a crew with
          an individual undergoing a certification. In addition, if the certified personnel
          commit an error, series of errors, or did not detect an error committed by others that
          they were in a position to have detected, they themselves may be decertified using the
          guidance in this chapter.
          3.6.1.4.3. While performing a TC upgrade certification, if a previously certified TM
          commits error(s) which would affect his/her TM certification, the decertification rules
          provided in this chapter will apply to his/her TM certification. This means that in
          addition to failing the certification and not upgrading to TC, the technician will also
          be decertified as a TM based on his/her error(s) committed.
 24                                                     AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013


      3.6.1.5. If decertified on either transfer or transport, subsequent recertification will occur
      on the specific operation the individual was performing when decertified.
   3.6.2. Weapons Maintenance Supervisory Certification. Supervisors, appointed IAW
   paragraph 1.4.4.9, will receive a one-time supervisory certification prior to; intervening when
   a rejectable component or weapon is encountered or to evaluate any unknown or unusual
   weapon or major component condition. Does not apply to ICBM critical task supervisors,
   see paragraph 4.1.6.9.
      3.6.2.1. Supervisors who intervene when a rejectable component or weapon is
      encountered or to evaluate any unknown or unusual weapon or major component
      condition will receive specific training on requirements contained in this Instruction and
      11N-35-51 to determine when a component or weapon is rejectable and what must be
      accomplished after the determination is made.
      3.6.2.2. Conducting the certification. The OO/MX SUPT will conduct supervisory
      certification through any appropriate combination of written tests, questioning, or
      providing scenarios. The OO/MX SUPT is not a certifying official as defined in
      paragraph 3.5 unless appointed IAW paragraph 3.5.1, they are certifying officials for
      supervisory certification. The OO/MX SUPT will not certify themselves, but the OO
      may certify the MX SUPT and vice versa. The OO/MX SUPT will validate individuals
      appointed IAW paragraph 1.4.4.9, are qualified to:
          3.6.2.2.1. Apply component, weapon, and weapon system inspection/rejection
          criteria; weapon system safety rules; weapon and weapon system specific safety and
          emergency procedures; weapon and weapon system specific general requirements;
          nuclear weapons fault isolation and troubleshooting limitations; general procedures
          contained in Section 2 of 11N-35-51 and requirements in this Instruction when a
          rejectable condition is discovered.
          3.6.2.2.2. Report abnormal or rejectable component or weapon defects; abnormal or
          rejectable weapon system and equipment deficiencies; and nuclear safety
          deficiencies.
3.7. Certification Documentation:
   3.7.1. Record certifications and proficiency checks on AF Form 2435, Load Training and
   Certification Document. Because of the critical nature of the certification, and to avoid
   conflicting certification data, the AF Form 2435 is to be used as a stand-alone document to
   validate current certification and proficiency status of tasks identified in paragraph 3.8 and is
   not meant to be used for historical purposes. The AF Form 2435 will also be used by the
   OO/MX SUPT to document supervisor certification identified in paragraph 3.6.2. The
   certifying official's signature on the AF Form 2435 is the formal act of certification.
   Automated systems may be used to monitor certifications and recurring proficiency checks.
   Automated systems cannot be used to verify/validate certifications. Keep AF Form 2435 in
   the individual's work center for easy access by supervisors, certifying officials, and
   dispatchers. No alterations to entries are authorized except Block 2. Use Figure 3.1 and
   Figure 3.2 as a guide.
   3.7.2. Complete the AF Form 2435 in ink or type except when use of pencil is indicated
   below:
AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013                                                                25


     3.7.2.1. Blocks 1-4, self-explanatory (Block 2 in pencil).
     3.7.2.2. Blocks 5-6, not applicable.
     3.7.2.3. Block 7; enter weapon type and task as listed in paragraph 3.8 or as directed by
     MAJCOM. Enter “TC”, “TM”, “TS”, “WC” or “DB” for appropriate team position or
     “SC” for supervisory certification.
     3.7.2.4. Blocks 8-11, self-explanatory.
     3.7.2.5. Block 12; enter the information from block 7 plus the current year. Enter a “C”
     for certified, a “P” for proficiency checks, a “D” for decertification, or an “X” (in pencil)
     for due date, under the corresponding month, year, and task. Block 12 is not required for
     individuals who only possess supervisory certification.
     3.7.2.6. Transcribe AF Form 2435 by copying the applicable information from Blocks 1
     through 8 and Block 12 of the old form to the new form. Enter "Transcribed" in Block
     11 of the new form. Flight Chief or above enters, signs, and dates a statement on the new
     form attesting to the accuracy of the transcribed entries. Destroy original AF Form 2435.
        3.7.2.6.1. Carry forward the last proficiency check or certification date (if no
        proficiency checks have been performed since certification) accomplished for each
        certified task.
        3.7.2.6.2. Due to decertification then subsequent recertification, if the recertification
        date of any prerequisite task (i.e. B61 GM, 4 Feb 07) is after the certification date(s)
        for any subsequent tasks (i.e. B61 LLC, 22 Aug 06), enter the original GM
        certification date (15 May 06) in block 8 on the line as the task. Enter the
        recertification date on the line immediately below the original date. The word
        TRANSCRIBED will be placed in block 11 on the same line as the recertification
        date. In this case, proficiency checks do not need to be carried forward.
        3.7.2.6.3. (Added-USAFE) Gaining units may transcribe certified tasks documented
        on an AF Form 2435 from the losing unit. In this case, ensure JQS tasks match or
        exceed unit requirements and perform proficiency check prior to transcription.
  3.7.3. Section/Element NCOIC, Flight Chief, or OO/MX SUPT will decertify individuals or
  supervisors for the following reasons:
     3.7.3.1. Failure to perform required proficiency check (N/A for Supervisory
     Certification).
     3.7.3.2. Failure to demonstrate required technical proficiency. Demonstrating lack of
     technical proficiency, to such a degree that the task being evaluated cannot be completed
     without direct supervisory intervention. This does not include abnormal conditions
     requiring supervisory assistance.
     3.7.3.3. Failure to use the required technical data during weapons maintenance,
     mate/demate, handling, or final assembly checkout tasks (i.e. no book or checklist, or
     wrong book or checklist).
     3.7.3.4. Technicians failed to detect a safety or reliability deficiency in the weapon,
     component, or support equipment.

     3.7.3.5. Upon upgrade certification to the TC position, decertify the individual from the
     TM position if certified in a TM position on the same task. Note: IAW paragraph
     3.8.1.1.3, TCs decertified on GM may not perform in a TM position on any other task on
     the same weapon system until recertified on GM.
     3.7.3.6. Committing procedural errors that, if not corrected, would likely result in an
     unreliable weapon, unsafe environment, or insecure environment. This includes violation
     of weapon system safety rules.

       limited movement within the maintenance or storage facilities for alignment or
       positioning of the weapon.
          3.8.1.1.1. GM certification allows technicians to perform any authorized
          maintenance, other than parachute exchange, not entailing disassembly of the
          warhead (e.g. removal of a major bulkhead or pressure cover allowing access to
          internal components).
          3.8.1.1.2. GM certification is required prior to certification on any other weapons
          maintenance task. When GM certification is a prerequisite for certification on any
          other task it is specifically identified in the task description. GM or LGM
          certification is not required for any weapons handling task. When technicians
          upgrade from TM to TC position, GM or LGM, as applicable must be the first task
          upgraded.
          3.8.1.1.3. Decertification on GM does not necessarily require decertification on any
          other task(s). However, the technician will not perform those tasks until recertified

AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013                                                                31


     3.8.3.2. Transport. Certification allows a technician to perform pre- and post-tow
     procedures, visual monitor/safety checks, and operate a tow vehicle or forklift
     transporting nuclear weapons within the limits of JQS qualifications. Personnel must
     have a valid operator’s permit and be JQS qualified on the tow vehicle or forklift
     checkout and operation, trailer checkout and pre-tow inspections, operating tow vehicle
     with trailer, and post tow inspection for each tow vehicle or trailer utilized. Formal
     certification is only required on first tow vehicle; JQS qualify individuals on all
     subsequent vehicles/trailers.
         3.8.3.2.1. Transport certification does not authorize an individual to install/remove
         tiedown devices, however, transport certified personnel must be able to ensure the
         load is secure and safe to transport.
         3.8.3.2.2. During transport certification, the operator must demonstrate an
         understanding of and ability to operate all levers, switches, gauges, etc. Operator
         must demonstrate proficiency in vehicle operation while towing a trailer. Units will
         develop a course to test the operator’s ability to turn (right and left), stop in an
         emergency, and back a loaded trailer.
         3.8.3.2.3. Certification is accomplished using the largest, fully loaded, transportable
         package (i.e., launcher, pylon, etc…) the operator is qualified to operate within the
         assigned work center. If an individual subsequently qualifies to operate a larger
         package, a new certification for that operation must be accomplished. If applicable,
         include CDS procedures as part of initial transport certification.
  3.8.4. Final Assembly Tests.
     3.8.4.1. RS Electrical Checkout. This certification allows a technician to perform
     electrical checkouts using the RSTS/SFTS. RS Electrical Checkout certification is
     accomplished using both the RSTS and SFTS. The RSTS portion of the certification will
     be performed by observing one of the following: Checkout of the arm/disarm device,
     electronic command signals programmer, targeting function, or chaff subsystem. The
     SFTS portion of the certification will be performed by observing one of the following:
     Fuze-set and verify or Pre-Arm D1/D2. Certification using one RS type constitutes
     certification for both if JQS qualifications are met.
     3.8.4.2. ALCM Loaded Launcher Test (LLT) / Loaded Pylon Test (LPT). This
     certification allows a technician to perform LLT or LPT. Certification on either LPT or
     LLT constitutes certification for both tasks if JQS qualification requirements are met.
     Document LPT/LLT certification on the same line of the AF Form 2435.
         3.8.4.2.1. LLT/LPT certification will be performed using serviceable missile(s) with
         payload electrically isolated or not installed. Certification may be completed using a
         fully loaded launcher/pylon or a single missile on a launcher/pylon. Only the end-to-
         end or single missile end-to-end test options will be used for certification.
         3.8.4.2.2. LLT/LPT successfully completed during certification are considered
         certified if the team passes the certification. If the test passes, but entire team or
         Team Chief certification is unsuccessful, the launcher/pylon is certified only if the
         test is overseen by a certified instructor, technician, or qualified certifying official.

3.9. Proficiency Checks.
   3.9.1. Proficiency checks will be accomplished at least quarterly for each certified task an
   individual is certified on. Personnel who possess only supervisory certification do not
   require proficiency checks.
   3.9.2. A JQS qualified QA, Bay Chief, Critical Task Supervisor, Section/Element
   Supervisor, or Flight Chief will conduct proficiency checks.
   3.9.3. Proficiency checks may be accomplished during maintenance on WR weapons, in
   conjunction with a personnel evaluation or during a higher headquarters evaluation or
   inspection.
   3.9.4. Proficiency checks will be performed on positions certified (i.e. TC, TM, diving
   board, work cage, etc…).
   3.9.5. Proficiency checks must be accomplished prior to the end of the third month. For
   example, the last proficiency check for B-61 LLC was accomplished in July 2007, the next
   check must be accomplished NLT the last day of October 2007.

         NUCLEAR WEAPONS MAINTENANCE AND HANDLING POLICIES

4.1. General Policies. The policies below are applicable to all maintenance personnel who
maintain, mate/demate, handle, checkout, or store nuclear weapons or TYPE 3 trainers. If there
is a conflict between the policies below and other directives notify the OPR of this publication
for resolution.
   4.1.1. Maintenance Capability.
       4.1.1.1. All levels of supervision will continually monitor shift manning/scheduling,
       equipment requirements, and will effectively schedule additional duties, leaves, training,
       and work details to provide maximum capability and minimize work force degradation.
       4.1.1.2. Train and certify sufficient personnel to meet mission requirements outlined in
       the MCL. LLCE and PC exchange certification is mandatory only if assigned weapons
       are within 3 months of required maintenance.
           4.1.1.2.1. If a unit is below their minimum MCL requirements for any reason
           (including leaves or TDYs); they are prohibited from performing WR maintenance
           unless approved by the Group commander. The Group commander must notify the
           applicable MAJCOM. The notification must include the reason for falling below
           MCL and specific actions/compensatory measures that are in place to minimize the
           impact on maintenance. Include projected “get well” date and ensure applicable AFI
           10-201, Status of Resources and Training System, reporting is accomplished.
   4.1.2. Maintenance, Storage, and Configuration.
       4.1.2.1. Keep nuclear weapons and warheads in fully assembled configurations except
       during maintenance or as otherwise directed by appropriate agencies. Submit requests to
       the applicable MAJCOM for deviations to storage configurations.
       4.1.2.2. Store nuclear weapons only in approved structures and configurations. Do not
       co-mingle nuclear and non-nuclear munitions/missiles (i.e., TYPE trainers/shapes, JTAs,
       TFPs, empty missiles/containers, CALCM/ALCM Test Instrumentation Kits (CATIK),
       etc…) in the same storage structure, cell, or WS3. Only as a last resort and with written
       MAJCOM approval may assets be co-mingled. All non-nuclear munitions/missiles will
       be identified using stanchions/cones, ropes, and placards to ensure there is a clear
       distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear munitions/missiles. Placards must indicate
       “Trainer”, “Empty”, “JTA”, or “CATIK”, as applicable.
       4.1.2.3. Non-operational weapons will be identified using placards marked “Non-
       Operational”. Make identification readily visible and do not remove until the status is
       changed or immediately before logistics movement. If a storage structure or cell contains
       all non-operational weapons a single placard may be posted at the entrance indicating all
       weapons inside the storage structure or cell are non-operational.
           4.1.2.3.1. It is not necessary to open a vault solely for the purpose of installing or
           removing a non-operational placard. Establish an Awaiting Maintenance (AWM)
           action against the weapon to install or remove placard during next scheduled opening.
34                                                   AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013


     4.1.2.4. Training and/or JTA and WR operations may take place at the same time as long
     as physical separation exists between operations. Physical separation must include clear
     delineation between operations using stanchions/cones, ropes, and placards. Placards
     must indicate “Training” or “JTA Operations”, as applicable. In USAFE, concurrent
     operations with training and/or JTA and WR weapons are not authorized in a Protective
     Aircraft Shelter (PAS).
     4.1.2.5. Weapons maintenance will have sufficient priority to ensure requirements
     spelled out in T.O. 11N-100-2, Supply Management of Limited-Life Components are met.
     Nuclear weapons maintenance will be completed within 60 calendar days (CONUS) and
     120 calendar days (OCONUS) from receipt of components. Request waivers IAW
     chapter 1 of this Instruction.
     4.1.2.6. Nuclear weapons repair actions must be completed as soon as possible, not to
     exceed 30 duty days (CONUS) and 60 duty day (OCONUS) following UR and/or DR
     disposition and/or receipt of required replacement parts. Request waivers IAW chapter 1
     of this Instruction.
     4.1.2.7. Cannibalization or interchanging of nuclear weapon components is not
     authorized unless directed in a technical order, UR, or by the AFNWC/ Nuclear Weapons
     Logistics Division.
     4.1.2.8. ICBM units will maintain sufficient RS spares to support operational
     requirements. Spares will remain fully assembled and operational, except when a
     configuration change is required to meet mission requirements. Spare systems may be
     rotated into the missile field to enhance flexibility of the wing’s maintenance schedule.
     4.1.2.9. OCONUS units must make every attempt to store WR weapons in a WSV at the
     end of the duty day. If a weapon cannot be fully reassembled, or cannot be returned to
     the WSV for any reason, the Group commander may authorize temporary storage outside
     of the WSV as a last resort. Unit will also notify USAFE/A10N and USAFE/A7SON
     immediately.
     4.1.2.10. Personnel may perform any inspection, test, or minor maintenance operation
     not involving weapon disassembly, in storage structures, vaults, alert areas, or generation
     areas. Examples include fin replacement, access door panel removal, coding operations
     and opening containers for inventory. Request waivers to this paragraph IAW AFMAN
     91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, and the applicable WSSRs.
     4.1.2.11. Whenever a warhead is exposed during a maintenance technical operation, all
     visible warhead surfaces will be inspected for defects IAW the applicable technical
     manuals. Reevaluate all defects to ensure previously acceptable defects are not rejectable
     because of criteria changes.
     4.1.2.12. Clearly mark empty weapon storage containers/bolsters IAW T.O. 11N-35-51,
     General Instructions Applicable to Nuclear Weapons.
     4.1.2.13. Nuclear weapons storage locations and maintenance bays must contain a
     thermometer if the types of weapons stored are required to comply with weapon
     temperature stabilization. This includes weapons storage vaults and WMTs.
AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013                                                            35


     4.1.2.14. In nuclear weapons maintenance facilities, display a locally manufactured
     sign/placard indicating Two-Person Concept is required (e.g. “No-Lone Zone Two-
     Person Concept Mandatory”) at the entrance to the maintenance bay, when applicable.
     Signs are not required in storage facilities or for outside operations.
     4.1.2.15. When WR weapon(s) are exposed in the maintenance bay or PAS and
     maintenance personnel are present, secure the personnel entry door from inside. Advance
     Entry Control System units are exempt from this requirement; however, the maintenance
     bay door must be closed. If not possible, a two-person team will control entry. SVA will
     approve all entry into exclusion areas.
  4.1.3. Receipt/Verification Inspections.
     4.1.3.1. Maintenance personnel perform verification inspections on weapons and
     components IAW applicable 11N series TOs as soon as practical after receipt to verify
     the identity, quantity, and serial numbers with data shown on the shipping document or
     DIAMONDS data. Open shipping containers for this verification; however, do not
     disassemble warhead sections, RVs, or bombs. Where weapon disassembly would be
     required, verification requirements can be satisfied by comparing visible information on
     the weapon with corresponding data on the shipping document or DIAMONDS data, and
     weapon history records accompanying the shipment.
     4.1.3.2. Do not open the H1616 or H1700 containers upon receipt. Verification of
     component serial numbers occurs only during unpacking before use. Both NARS and
     maintenance personnel will use serial numbers and reservoir fill dates on the shipping
     documentation, DIAMONDS data, and exterior tags on containers to report receipt. If a
     discrepancy is found between the shipping documentation, DIAMONDS data, and the
     container, contact the MAJCOM immediately and submit UR IAW T.O. 11N-5-1,
     Unsatisfactory Reports. Obtain component part numbers from the item TO. For
     DIAMONDS database purposes, if part number suffix is unknown use part number plus -
     XX (Example: 123456-XX). For special instructions for shipments between Military
     First Destinations (MFD) and overseas locations, see T.O. 11N-100-3150, Joint
     Reporting Structure; Nuclear Weapons Reports.
     4.1.3.3. H1616 and H1700 container serial numbers, DOT expiration dates, and content
     condition will be updated in the NMC2 SharePoint Environment as changes occur.
     NARS personnel will use expiration dates to ensure assets are not shipped in overdue
     containers beyond the MFD.
     4.1.3.4. Do not open packaged MC4519 assemblies upon receipt. Item is to be opened
     only by the end user immediately prior to use, as directed by applicable TO procedures.
     4.1.3.5. NARS personnel will perform inspections of spare parts. If spare parts are
     determined to be unserviceable, report IAW T.O. 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports.
  4.1.4. Defects and Deficiencies.
     4.1.4.1. Stop operations upon the discovery of a defect that causes rejection of a weapon
     or major component, or upon encountering any unknown or unusual weapon or major
     component condition. Contact the Bay Chief, Nuclear Maintenance Element/Section
     NCOIC, Flight Chief, or OO/MX SUPT to inform them of the condition. They will in-

     turn contact a supervisor appointed IAW paragraph 1.4.4.9 who will determine whether
     to continue operations based on careful review of the facts and circumstances.
     Supervisors making this decision must be supervisory certified and appointed IAW
     paragraph 1.4.4.9. This approval to continue does not relieve the unit of any reporting
     requirements (UR/Dull Sword). Complete the operation if the weapon is safe and no
     damage will occur. Following determination that technical data does not provide
     procedures or adequately address the problem, contact the applicable MAJCOM who will
     coordinate with the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division to resolve the
     situation. Direct contact between MAJCOMs or units and other agencies (e.g. Defense
     Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) or Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)) for any
     weapons related technical resolution is prohibited unless directed by the AFNWC
     Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division.
         4.1.4.1.1. On site DOE representatives may determine continuation of operation (e.g.
         PAL operation, defect acceptance) when authorized procedures are not available in
         governing T.O. However, unit personnel must report the defect(s) according to T.O.
         11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports, and/or AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety
         Investigations and Reports, as applicable.
         4.1.4.1.2. When technical procedures call for components/parts to be rejected at
         lowest level available in spares, weapons will be placed in non-operational status if
         the component/part cannot be replaced within Nuclear Reporting (NUREP) timelines.
         Weapons will also be placed in non-operational status if involved in an accident or
         incident and the condition is unknown (e.g. lightning strike, fire, loss of custody,
         etc…).
     4.1.4.2. Non-operational Tools, Test, and Handling Equipment (TTHE) must be returned
     to operational status as soon as possible, not to exceed 30 duty days following UR, DR,
     Dull Sword, Engineering Technical Assistance Request (ETAR), and/or receipt of
     required replacement parts.
  4.1.5. Deficiency Reporting.
     4.1.5.1. Deficiencies associated with nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon-related items,
     associated equipment/software or technical orders/publications must be reported.
     4.1.5.2. When assistance is required and the problem does not fit into one of the below
     categories use procedures in T.O. 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance. Use requests
     from T.O. 00-25-107 for problems with maintenance procedures or production that are
     beyond the capability of the maintaining command. Maintenance assistance may take the
     form of emergency maintenance support, technical assistance, or a combination of both.
     4.1.5.3. Use procedures in T.O. 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports, to report a deficiency
     on DOE-designed nuclear weapons or related components, DOE-designed
     equipment/software, a JNWPS technical order discrepancy/deficiency, or when DoD-
     designed items require evaluation based upon their interface with DOE-designed items.
     Nuclear weapons placed in non-operational status will only be returned to operational
     status when officially directed by the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division or
     when directed via an assigned DTRA UR number.

     4.1.5.4. Use procedures in AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports,
     to report a safety related accident, incident or deficiency (Broken Arrow, Bent Spear or
     Dull Sword) on items covered in the USAF Master Nuclear Certification List web site or
     T.O. 21M-LGM30F-12-1, Minuteman Nuclear Surety Procedures. Examples include but
     are not limited to general-purpose vehicles, ICBM related equipment, nuclear certified
     aircraft software, two-person concept violations, etc.
     4.1.5.5. Use procedures in T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and
     Investigating System, to report deficiencies on DoD-designed items.
     4.1.5.6. In certain instances, it may be necessary to submit multiple reports on one
     deficiency. For example:
        4.1.5.6.1. Submit reports IAW T.O. 11N-5-1, Unsatisfactory Reports, and AFMAN
        91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports, for:
        4.1.5.6.2. A weapon involved in an accident or incident (lightning, vehicle accident,
        loss of custody, etc).

        4.1.5.8.2. Warhead/weapon damage due to hoist failure.
        4.1.5.8.3. The steering fails on a newly manufactured/certified forklift causing
        vehicle and weapon damage.
  4.1.6. Maintenance Tasks.
     4.1.6.1. Personnel will not perform WR operations until they complete weapons
     academic training, applicable safety training, and nuclear weapons certification
     requirements IAW Chapter 3.
     4.1.6.2. Nuclear weapons operations will be performed by 2M0XX/2WXXX personnel.
     2M0X2s perform RS mate/demate and weapons handling tasks. 2M0X1s perform select
     mate/demate tasks, weapons handling tasks, and launcher/pylon tests. 2WXXX perform
     weapons handling tasks. 2W2XX perform weapons maintenance, mate/demate, and

38                                                   AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013


        4.1.6.2.1. In circumstances where there are insufficient 2M0XX or 2WXXX
        personnel available to perform the required nuclear weapons operations the applicable
        MAJCOM will designate AFSCs to augment assigned 2M0XX or 2WXXX
        personnel, however, there must be core 2W/2M personnel assigned and available to
        manage and oversee the nuclear operations. In addition to AFSC requirements all
        training, security clearance, PRP requirements, and certification requirements are
        applicable.
     4.1.6.3. DELETED.
     4.1.6.4. DELETED.
     4.1.6.5. A certified TC will direct all certified weapons maintenance, weapons
     mate/demate, and final assembly test operations. TCs may not direct multiple operations
     simultaneously. MAJCOMs or units may require a TC to direct weapons handling tasks
     performed with WR weapons.
        4.1.6.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Team Chief Certification is required for transfer
        operations.
     4.1.6.6. Team chiefs will give team briefings before starting operations involving a WR
     nuclear weapon or warhead. The briefing must include, as a minimum: description of the
     task, designation of personnel assigned to the task, nuclear surety IAW AFI 91-101, Air
     Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program, necessary safety, emergency, and intrinsic
     radiation procedures, and the requirement of the Two-Person Concept.
     4.1.6.7. When technicians do not have physical access to TOs and are performing
     nuclear weapons maintenance, mate/demate, final assembly checkout, and handling tasks,
     a verbal demand-response technique must be used. The step to be performed, along with
     all notes, cautions and warnings, will be read to the technicians performing the work.
     The performing technicians will acknowledge understanding, perform the step, and then
     verbally verify completion to the person reading the steps. The person reading the steps
     will then check off the steps. If technicians are using technical data and checking off
     steps as they perform them (such as cleaning person on LLCE operations), a TC must
     ensure all steps are completed prior to weapon/component reassembly. Note: the above
     referenced operations often require the use of general procedures contained in both
     Operations and Maintenance and Methods and Procedures technical orders (i.e. 11N-35-
     51, 1-1A-8, 00-25-234, etc.). These technical orders do not require verbal demand-
     response or checking off of steps.
     4.1.6.8. If an operation is halted for any reason, TC will mark the last step accomplished.
     Resume the operation only after reviewing the checklist or technical order in order to
     determine the operation restart point.
     4.1.6.9. ICBM Critical Task Supervisors are required to oversee all RS mate/demate or
     transfer operations involving WR. Critical task supervisors are not required to oversee
     transport operations. Critical task supervisors are not required to be supervisor certified
     IAW paragraph 3.6.2.

     4.1.7.1. Cover nuclear weapons, TYPE 3 trainers, JTA, compatibility test units, and
     flight test units during all movements (EXCEPTION: Containerized weapons, RSs, and
     Cruise Missiles do not require covers). BDUs do not require covers when simulating WR
     weapons. JTA movements outside controlled areas must have appropriate level of
     security dependent upon security requirements for each JTA type.
     4.1.7.2. US custody of nuclear weapons must be maintained during all aspects of nuclear
     weapons storage, handling and logistics movements.
     4.1.7.3. All on-base nuclear weapons movements outside the restricted area must have a
     member serving as a technical and safety advisor. The convoy technical and safety
     advisor will be an NCO that is JQS qualified and fully knowledgeable of tiedown,
     transportation, handling, CDS, custody transfer, and emergency procedures as applicable.
        4.1.7.3.1. For ICBM RS convoys, any certified PT driver can serve as the technical

  4.1.10. Certifying Nuclear Weapons, Nuclear Warheads, and Components Mated to RS or
  Multiple Carriage Launch Gear.
40                                                   AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013


     4.1.10.1. Certifying RS and multiple carriage launch gear configurations.
        4.1.10.1.1. When building RS, pylon, and launcher prepare a nuclear weapon
        configuration record (buildup sheet) to reflect the association of warhead and
        component serial numbers to RS, air launched missiles, and the missiles or bombs
        with the pylon or launcher. The maintenance TC responsible for final assembly must
        prepare and sign the nuclear weapon configuration record (buildup sheet), and a
        senior NCO or officer must visually verify the serial numbers and configuration and
        certify doing so by signing the nuclear weapon configuration record (buildup sheet).
        The TC and certifying individual must both initial beside any changes to the record.
        This certified record becomes the source document for tracking the location of
        weapons and components during storage, alert, and aircraft generation. Follow
        procedures in TO 11N-100-3150-8-1, USAF DIAMONDS Policy and Procedures, for
        configuration records (buildup sheet module) maintained in DIAMONDS.
        4.1.10.1.2. Exceptions to visual verification.    Information from the hot gas
        generator/rocket motor and hot gas generator/rocket motor initiator may be obtained
        from the previous build-up sheet.
        4.1.10.1.3. During build-up/recycle maintenance, for systems returning to operational
        status, if the previous build-up sheet is missing information, disassemble the
        component to the point where the information can be obtained. Reject the component
        if unserviceable. EXCEPTION: Electric explosive device, if information is illegible,
        not available or requires removal notify conventional munitions inspector for
        serviceability validation.
        4.1.10.1.4. For items that do not have lot number or manufacture date etched,
        stamped or marked on the component, annotate the build sheet column “not present.”
        For lot number or manufacture date that are not legible, annotate the build sheet
        column “not legible.”
     4.1.10.2. Nuclear weapon configuration records (build-up sheets) for launchers and
     pylons will be created and verified for both WR and non-WR packages. Clearly mark
     nuclear weapon configuration records (build-up sheets) for non-WR packages as “NOT
     WR”.
     4.1.10.3. Use the nuclear weapon configuration record (buildup sheet) as the source
     document to establish the configuration of the RS, pylon, or launcher.
     4.1.10.4. Forward the original certified nuclear weapon configuration record (buildup
     sheet) and AF Form 1764 or equivalent, if applicable, to the MASO, munitions control,
     and keep a copy in the maintenance section. Follow procedures in TO 11N-100-3150-8-
     1, USAF DIAMONDS Policy and Procedures, for configuration records (buildup sheet
     module) maintained in DIAMONDS.
     4.1.10.5. Units may elect to report in-hand/on-hand changes to the MASO based on RS,
     launcher, and pylon serial numbers only; however, if they do so, the MASO must
     maintain the certified nuclear weapon configuration record (buildup sheet) showing the
     configuration of the RS or launch gear at the time of the report for as long as they retain
     the SCR.
AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013                                                            41


     4.1.10.6. Swap of a single missile on a pylon or launcher, or a single bomb on a launcher
     or loaded combat aircraft.
         4.1.10.6.1. Prepare an updated certified nuclear weapon configuration record (build-
         up sheet).
         4.1.10.6.2. Forward the original of the updated nuclear weapon configuration record
         (build-up sheet) to the MASO and a copy to munitions control and keep a copy in
         maintenance section.
  4.1.11. RV/RS Records Jacket.
     4.1.11.1. A record jacket will be established for each RS. It will contain, as a minimum,
     the following:
         4.1.11.1.1. Certified nuclear weapon configuration record (build-up sheets).
         4.1.11.1.2. Completed Work Orders. Retain the IMDS product, which documented
         all IPI’s listed on the Group IPI listing.
  4.1.12. Trainer Maintenance.
     4.1.12.1. Use TYPE 3 A/C trainers for maintenance and Explosive Ordnance Disposal
     (EOD) training only. Do not use these trainers for aircraft or ICBM load training, or
     logistical movement exercises and evaluations without AFNWC Nuclear Weapons
     Logistics Division approval. Use TYPE 3E trainers, RV/RS trainers (UA/UE), TFPs, or
     BDUs for this purpose. Trainers must be controlled, stored, and secured according to
     their respective security classification.
     4.1.12.2. Maintain nuclear weapon TYPE 3 A/C trainers to WR standards using
     procedures in T.O. 11N-35-51, General Instructions Applicable to Nuclear Weapons, and
     the applicable weapons manual. TYPE 3 A/C trainers used exclusively for EOD training
     will be maintained in a WR configuration and may deviate from WR standards with UR
     approval. Inspect all other nuclear weapons trainers, TYPE 3E, load shape/trainers as
     specified in the applicable technical order, not to exceed 180-days. RV/RS (UA/UE)
     load shape trainers are maintained IAW applicable 43D-series technical orders.
         4.1.12.2.1. For those trainers not on the weapons maintenance custody account or
         installed in ALCM Interface Test Trainers (ITT), the OO/MX SUPT and owning
         agency will work out a periodic inspection and maintenance schedule to fix
         deficiencies in order to keep the trainers in WR configuration. Use IMDS to track
         inspection and maintenance of trainers.
     4.1.12.3. Units may elect to track deficiencies/historical documentation for TYPE 3E
     load shape/trainers using AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record, AFTO
     Form 95, Significant Historical Data, or IMDS, as appropriate. An IRC is not required
     on TYPE 3E or BDU load shape/trainers.
     4.1.12.4. Prohibit installation of WR items, components, or materiel on TYPE 3/UA/UE
     trainers unless authorized by technical data or the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics
     Division. (EXCEPTION: Reuse of expended or expired Group X items for training is
     acceptable). Never install training items, components, or materiel on WR items.
  4.1.13. Waste Management.
42                                                  AFI21-204_USAFESUP_I 9 MAY 2013


     4.1.13.1. Three basic types of tightly regulated materials can be generated during nuclear
     weapons maintenance activities. These generated materials may become wastes
     regulated either as Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste,
     91b Waste or Potentially Mixed Waste. Maintenance personnel shall assure that all
     wastes are properly identified, segregated and containerized as the waste is generated and
     according to the type of waste being generated. Appropriate precautions to avoid co-
     mingling of different types shall be taken to minimize the generation of a Potentially
     Mixed Waste.
     4.1.13.2. RCRA regulated hazardous waste includes spent and/or expired hazardous
     materials that are available for use or used in the routine conduct of the maintenance
     activities and includes solvent soaked rags or wipes. RCRA Hazardous Waste, however,
     does not include materials that become contaminated by a radioactive source or
     demonstrate a radioactive property. RCRA wastes include items such as un-useable or
     spent solvents, lubricants and paints.
     4.1.13.3. 91b Waste is generated when a system component is inherently and/or becomes
     contaminated solely by a radioactive source within the contiguous volume where a
     tritium reservoir resides without the introduction of a hazardous material. These wastes
     include items such as compression pads, un-greased O-rings, Kim wipes or Q-tips used to
     wipe internal components without the use of solvents, and expired weapon desiccants.
        4.1.13.3.1. 91(b) waste areas for MK12A are: Inside of the associated aft section and
        inside surfaces of the H1223A/B aft bulkhead cover/ring.
        4.1.13.3.2. 91b areas for the MK21 are: the enclosure formed by the inside of the
        Warhead Electrical System (WES) cap and aft end of the AFA and inside the WES
        cap.
     4.1.13.4. Potentially Mixed Waste is generated when a 91b Waste is combined with a
     RCRA Hazardous Waste. An example is a Kim wipe, wiper or rag that becomes
     contaminated with spent hazardous material solvent once used to wipe internal
     components and surfaces of a radioactive source.
     4.1.13.5. Collection and Identification. Local bioenvironmental section may survey and
     perform analysis on hazardous waste containers to determine what type of waste is
     generated. These surveys can be used to reduce the number of containers distributed to
     maintenance activities.
     4.1.13.6. RCRA Hazardous Waste Management guidance is available through the
     Installation Environmental Flight. Base-wide instructions are also found in the
     installation Hazardous Waste Management Plan (HWMP), which outlines specific
     procedures for managing hazardous waste. Coordinate through the local environmental
     management flight for container turn-in or pick-up and disposal IAW AFI 32-7042, Solid
     and Hazardous Waste Compliance.
     4.1.13.7. Package 91b Waste in the smallest plastic bags consistent with the operation
     being performed and store in 30 to 55-gallon drums. Label packages and drums
     “Potentially 91b Waste". Coordinate through local bioenvironmental channels for
