their units, to fly in a primary crew position in assigned aircraft in which they are not qualified.
Approval authority for all commanders/supervisors above the WG/CC is USAFE/A3 (submit
requests IAW paragraph 1.7.2. (Added). Reference AFI 11-2MDSV3 for further guidance.
3.6.1.1. (Added) Newly assigned crewmembers, on active status seeking to obtain mission
ready status in their primary MDS, may be authorized to observe the local pattern in any unit-
assigned aircraft. If not flying their assigned MDS, individuals will be under the supervision of
an instructor and will not be at a set of operational controls. The crewmember will log an "O" or
"X" as the aircrew qualification code first character and his or her assigned second character
crew position code IAW Table A2.3. (As noted above, Flight time flown in "O" or "X" status
does not entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP.)

                                  ORIENTATION FLIGHTS

A5.1. (Added) General. These flights are an exceptional use of USAF aircraft, flown only
when the benefits to the USAF are clearly established. Use these limited resources to familiarize
selected passengers with aircraft capability and employment concepts, and to increase public
understanding and appreciation of the USAF. Direct all inquiries concerning the USAFE
Orientation Flight Program to HQ USAFE/A3TVF (usafe.a3tvf@ramstein.af.mil).
A5.2. (Added) Orientation Flight. As defined in paragraph 5.1. (Added), there are four
categories of ―exceptional use‖ flights: Incentive, Distinguished Visitor (DV), Familiarization
(FAM), and Spouse Orientation Flights. Table 1.1. of the basic instruction provides
orientation/familiarization flight eligibility and approval authorities. Table A5.1. (Added) shows
delegated approval authorities for the categories listed. If a particular category is not listed
below, the approval authority has not been delegated. Approvals for incentive, DV and spouse
orientation flights are for a one-time flight ONLY. Familiarization flight approvals may
include periodic flights, but local commanders must establish specific learning objectives for
each mission. Develop local procedures to identify and outline those objectives, and ensure the
objectives were met after each flight. NOTE: Restriction against carrying a camera during
flights in fighter aircraft. Reference AFI 11-202V3 and USAFESUP for restrictions on use of
personal cameras during flight.

 NOTE: During contingency operations, or in any designated combat or imminent danger zone,
 orientation flights may be flown only if the mission aircraft is scheduled to continuously
 remain outside of hostile airspace. Conduct all flights so as to prevent entitlement to hostile
 fire or imminent danger pay. These restrictions apply to all categories of orientation flights.
 Exception: Under certain circumstances, Public Affairs (PA) personnel may fly within a
 hostile fire zone. Consult with applicable PA office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
 details. Furthermore, unit incentive flights may be flown only during designated local training
 sorties. Review Table 1.1. NOTES for compliance.
A5.2.1. (Added) Officers Awaiting PCS Training (APT). APT flights are limited to active duty
Air Force officers awaiting Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT). These personnel are
authorized to receive familiarization flights based on the level of preparatory training
accomplished prior to such flights. APTs are authorized an unlimited number of familiarization
flights, but only if such flights do not adversely affect the unit Status of Resources and Training
System (SORTS) rating. Do NOT list these individuals on the AFTO Form 781. These members
will not log flight time. Flight physicals and physiological training may not be required. Only
individuals who have successfully completed physiological training, however, will be authorized
to engage in flights above flight level (FL) 180 in fighter aircraft. APTs that do not possess a
current physiological training card are not authorized to undergo physiological training within
USAFE.
A5.3. (Added) Request and Reporting Procedures. For orientation flights that require
approval above wing level, submit request to the NAF/CC. For orientation flights that require
approval above the NAF/CC, submit IAW paragraph 1.7.2. (Added) If the flight requires
COMUSAFE approval, HQ USAFE/A3T must receive the request at least 2 weeks prior to
the flight. If the flight requires HQ USAF approval, HQ USAFE/A3T must receive the
request at least 30 days prior to the flight. Use a staff summary format when requesting
approval above wing level (contact HQ USAFE/A3TVF for questions regarding routing). Unless
otherwise directed in this supplement, approval for all categories of orientation flights is one-
time only, and these flights must occur within 60 days of the approval date. Orientation flight
requests approved at the NAF will include HQ USAFE/A3T in the approval notification.
AFI11-401_USAFESUP 28 NOVEMBER 2011                                                             17


A5.3.1. (Added) Units conducting orientation/familiarization flights will attach a copy of the
approval notification to the aircraft flight authorization, and document the flight details in an
orientation/familiarization flight log. As a minimum, logs must contain the flight date,
orientation flight category, candidate name(s), status (i.e., active duty U.S. military, foreign
national, etc.), nationality (non-U.S. citizens only) and approval level.
A5.3.1.1. (Added) Requests must include the following: Name, grade, nationality and position
of the orientation candidates. Flights may be approved for well-defined groups if individual
names are not known.
