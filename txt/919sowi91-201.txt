6. Explosives Limits: Obtain and use the fewest munitions necessary for each exercise. Daily
explosives limits are listed in the applicable operating safety section or attachment of this
instruction. The SE may authorize exceptions to these explosive limits on a casebycase basis.
Note: SFS training munitions will not exceed authorizations in Air Force Catalog (AFCAT) 21-
209V1, Ground Munitions.
7. Personnel Limits: Will be determined by the operation or training event and include all
workers or personnel being trained, casuals, and supervisors. In all cases, personnel limits will
be the minimum necessary to accomplish training and approved by 919 SOW/SE.
8. Exact Locations: Local exercises will be conducted on the Eglin reservation. Training areas
must be selected with assurance that no military or civilian nonparticipants will intrude.
Locations off Duke Field must be coordinated with Eglin range control and 919 SOW/SE, prior
to use. The exercise team chief will include exact locations in the exercise risk assessment. Map
grid coordinates are highly encouraged.
9. Munitions Accountability:
   9.1. Units requiring training munitions for an exercise or training will contact the 919 SOW
   Environmental Manager in writing; 45 days prior to scheduled training to obtain an
   environmental impact approval for the proposed training/exercise. This approval will be in
   the form of an AF Form 813, Request for Environment Impact Analysis. Upon completion of
   training/exercise report exact number and types of munitions expended to the 919 SOW
   Environmental Manager.
   9.2. Units requiring training munitions for an exercise or training will submit a digitally
   signed electronic request to the munitions storage supervisor, through 919 SOW/SE. (See
   Attachment 6 for a sample). Requests will be submitted to 919 SOW/SE at least two weeks
   prior to the start of the exercise. A copy of the approved AF Form 813 must be attached.
   Munitions will not be issued without SE approval.
   9.3. Munitions will only be issued from the munitions section to munitions account
   custodians or trained and qualified individuals designated by the custodian to receive the
   munitions.
   9.4. Only the minimum quantity of munitions necessary for training will be removed from
   storage facility at any time. Whenever practical, only one day's supply will be withdrawn
   daily.
   9.5. Munitions will remain packaged as received from the munitions storage area until time
   to be used. Return unused munitions to original packaging after use.
   9.6. Blank ammunition may be issued to trainees after their weapons safety briefing and
   requirements of paragraph 4 have been met. Issues will be in minimum quantities necessary
   for one day's expenditure. Users will keep a record of munitions quantities they issue and
   expend.
   9.7. Individuals will police up expended brass and munitions residue to the greatest extent
   possible and turn-in as residue.

   9.8. Munitions Account Custodians will coordinate with the munitions section for the pickup
   and return of unexpended munitions. All munitions residue must be returned to the
   munitions storage area by the next working day. All expenditures will be certified by a
   Munitions Account Custodian. Quantities must account for all munitions issued in support of
   the exercise/training. Certification should be completed at the time of munitions residue
   turnin, but not later than 1100L the next duty day.
10. Transporting Munitions:
   10.1. Transporting munitions by vehicle requires special operator training and vehicle
   equipment. Arrangements can often be made to have munitions transported by specialists
   and vehicles from our munitions maintenance section. This is the preferred method for
   transportation. This service is provided as a courtesy, on a workload permitting basis, and
   may not always be available. Requests must be made to the munitions section chief at least
   two weeks before transportation support is needed. Off-base munitions movements require a
   commercial driver’s license and must be approved through the Transportation Management
   Office (TMO).
   10.2. Personnel transporting munitions must comply with explosive transportation
   requirements in AFMAN 91-201 and subsequent AFIs. Some considerations are:
      10.2.1. Only government owned and operated vehicles equipped with a minimum of two
      portable 2A:10BC fire extinguishers will be used to transport munitions.
      10.2.2. Simulators and smoke producing munitions will not be transported in Privately
      Owned Vehicles (POV), pockets, or unmarked containers.
      10.2.3. Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) 2WOXl, (Munitions Systems Personnel) will
      be the only 919 SOW members to transport munitions (except aircrew survival signals
      and blank ammunition in individual issue quantities).
      10.2.4. Transport explosives in their approved storage and shipping packaging. If less
      than a single shipping package must be transported, pack the explosives separately from
      other items enclosed in clearly identified metal or wooden containers.
      10.2.5. Drivers must be trained and tested in operation of the type vehicle used, and
      informed of the explosive hazards.
      10.2.6. Authorized explosives movement routes will be used to the maximum extent
      possible. Plan to avoid inhabited areas.
      10.2.7. Transport munitions strapped down in cargo compartment of vehicles.
      10.2.8. Personnel will not ride in cargo compartments of vehicles which are transporting
      munitions.
      10.2.9. No smoking in vehicles transporting munitions. Keep munitions 50 feet away
      from open flames.
      10.2.10. Vehicles transporting munitions will not be refueled or have maintenance
      performed except as permitted in AF MAN 91-201 chapter 8.37.
919SOWI91-201 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                          11

                OUTLINE FOR LOCALLY WRITTEN EXPLOSIVES OIS

A9.1. OUTLINE FOR LOCALLY WRITTEN EXPLOSIVES OIs.
A9.2. Requirements: All 919 SOW locally written explosives OIs should consist of the
following 12 paragraphs and required attachments (Paragraph A9.13). Each “Bold” paragraph
below corresponds with a paragraph heading or a section which must be addressed in an
explosive OI. The 12 paragraphs will address common questions asked by higher headquarters
inspectors during inspections. AFMAN 91-201 mandates seven areas which must be addressed
in all operations involving explosives and the other six are addressed in AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management. The AFMAN 91-201 areas are identified by an (*)
asterisk. Written instructions must be developed for all explosive operations. If other documents
such as technical orders or safety briefings cover all the items required below, separate written
instructions are not required. All licensed locations must have an OI established for their
explosive operations. Coordinate all OIs through the SEW and have them approved by the
Squadron CC or equivalent. (AFI 91-202)
A9.3. Guidance: 919 SOW’s guidance is consistent with operational requirements to:
   A9.3.1. Observe explosives safety practices during all operations (includes war time,
   preparation for war, armistice, heightened tensions, etc.) that include the use of live
   explosives.
   A9.3.2. Comply with Department of Defense (DoD) and AF explosives safety and
   environmental standards.
   A9.3.3. Provide the maximum possible protection to personnel and property, both inside and
   outside the installation, from the damaging effects of potential accidents involving
   ammunition and explosives.
   A9.3.4. Comply with the cardinal principle for explosives safety—Expose the minimum
   number of people to the minimum amount of explosives for the minimum amount of time.
   A9.3.5. Comply with this OI except when compliance with more restrictive local standards
   is mandatory by an international agreement.
A9.4. References: In attachment 1, list other instructions, manuals, T.O., etc. used for
supporting information. AFMAN 91-201, and item unique T.O.’s should always be references.
List by number and full title.
A9.5. Terminology: In attachment 1, in some cases it may be necessary to define certain
words for readers. Remember your audience.
A9.6. Responsibilities: It is necessary, depending on the operation covered in the OI, to spell
out responsibilities by flight chief, supervisor, crew chief, worker, etc. This is a good way to
ensure all personnel know what is required of them during explosive operations.
A9.7. General Requirements: List general requirements established locally or by other
directives.
A9.8. * Explosive Limits: Clearly state the authorized NEW or the exact number of explosive
items permitted, HC/D and compatibility group of the explosives involved. For licensed
 28                                                         919SOWI91-201 6 OCTOBER 2014


locations, use information from the AF Form 2047. Sited locations such as the Munitions
Storage Area should use the NEW from the explosive site plan (ESP) authorized for the location.
(AFMAN 91-201) (Three parts)
A9.9. * Personnel Limits: Personnel limits should be clearly stated for the operations being
conducted at each explosives operating location. Limits will distinguish between the number of
supervisors, workers and casuals, and kept to the minimum number needed/authorized to conduct
the operation. Casuals are persons not normally part of an explosives operation but have duties
that require their presence, such as quality assurance, safety or inspection personnel. Visitors are
non-essential personnel with limited access. Stop operations when visitors are present. Keep
personnel limits to a minimum to get the job done. (AFMAN 91-201)
A9.10. * Exact Location: Exact locations where explosives operations are done must be
included in written instructions. This could be a pad, building, room etc. Be specific when
documenting the location. (Such as building 3136, bay 2, south wall). (AFMAN 91-201)
A9.11. *     Safety     Requirements. Include       in     written   procedures     any     safety
requirements/precautions that must be adhered to during the operation. Also, any personal
protective clothing or equipment needed to conduct the operation should be included (i.e. fire
extinguishers, gloves, goggles, face shields, hardhats, etc.). Address the requirement to remove
jewelry, watches, rings, etc. before working with explosives in this paragraph. (AFMAN 91-
201)
A9.12. * Step-by-Step Procedures: This section of the OI describes procedures for doing the
operation. All steps required for completing the task should be stated here. Steps taken leading
up to the use of a T.O. and steps taken after the T.O. requirements are completed. Include any
unique procedures for completing the task here. For operations requiring T.O., refer to the
specific steps, don’t copy or rewrite tech data steps in the OI. This area should address all
actions from cradle to grave. (AFMAN 91-201)
A9.13. * Emergency Actions: Include actions to be taken during an emergency or when
abnormal conditions are noted and ensure personnel understand their roles during an emergency
or when an abnormal condition exists. Include individual responsibilities, withdrawal distances,
Firefighting, escape routes agencies to be contacted, phone numbers etc. Crew chief or
supervisor must ensure all personnel involved in the operation are aware of their responsibility
should an emergency arise or an abnormal condition is noted. (Abnormal conditions are not
normally treated the same as an emergency). (AFMAN 91-201) (Two Parts)
A9.14. * Pre-Task Briefing: 919 SOW Form 13 has been developed to provide a standardized
way of conducting safety briefings prior to commencing an explosive operation. Pre-task
briefing will be accomplished using the 919 SOW Form 13 for the required task. STIFs will be
maintained for operations involving explosives. Once completed, they will be maintained in a
central location and accessible to all personnel who will conduct or inspect explosives
operations.
A9.14.1. OIs must address who can approve the 919 SOW Form 13 if other than the Squadron
CC or equivalent. (AFMAN 91-201)

A9.14.2. Detailed Instructions for completing the 919 SOW Form 13 is provided in Attachment
8 of this instruction.
919SOWI91-201 6 OCTOBER 2014                                                               29


A9.15. Attachments: Attachment 1 is always the Glossary of References. Add attachments to
further clarify the operation. (Such as illustrations, maps, tables, and diagrams). Add any
document which might enhance the OI. The specific task briefing listed in paragraph A.9.12 can
be addressed as an attachment.
