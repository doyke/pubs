     7.4. Pro Super/ Expediter and MOC will coordinate with each other to ensure a JCN and
     Red-X discrepancy is entered in the aircraft forms to include last known location and
     description of tool/item and ensure an AFRC Form 174 Lost Tool/Object Report, or TC
     MAX generated form is initiated.
     7.5. Quality Assurance will enter all lost tool reports into the QANTTAS Program for trend
     and tracking purposes.
     7.6. If the tool/item is not found, only an individual authorized and identified on the special
     certification roster (SCR) to clear the red ―X‖ for MISSING TOOLS/ITEMS will clear the
     Red-X.
     7.7. Lost Rags will be treated the same as a lost tool and personnel will use the same
     procedures.
     7.8. If a tool/item is found missing after an aircraft has taxied or taken off, a description of
     the tool and suspected area where the item was lost will be reported to the Command Post to
     notify the aircrew. The Aircraft Commander (AC) will then determine what action to take on
     a case-by-case basis
     7.9. If a tool/item is discovered missing off station, the MEP or flight crew will enter a Red
     X in the aircraft forms and inform the AC of the situation. If at a C130 support base, the
     aircrew will inform the local MOC and QA office of the condition. The MEP or flight crew
     will immediately perform a lost tool/item inspection. If the tool/item is recovered, the MEP
     or flight crew will clear the Red X in accordance with TO 00-20-1. If the tool/item cannot be
     recovered the A/C will coordinate with the MXG/CC to determine the procedures to be
     followed.
