SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change (IC) (Change 5) amends Attachment 3. Attachment 3 was found to be
confusing as to the types of communications services available to those individuals who qualify
for communications equipment in their personal quarters funded with appropriated funds. This
change addresses inconsistencies in application which have resulted from the confusion in
interpreting the original language. This IC also reflects an increased emphasis on IP-Based
telephony and a reduction of the existing Voice Network footprint. This IC deletes paragraphs
that have been incorporated into AFI 33-100, User Responsibilities and Guidance For
Information Systems. Updated organizational office symbols.

(934AW) The information in the previous supplement has been integrated into the actual AFI
33-111, and subsequently has been eliminated in this revision. The numbering has changed for
the current supplemental information. A (|) indicates revisions from previous edition.

Section B— Telephone Services and Special Features

11. Requesting Telephone and Telephone-Related Service.
   11.1. The CSO will:
      11.1.1. Accept base telephone service requirements and process these requirements in a
      timely manner to establish, add, change, or delete voice services according to established
      local policy.
          11.1.1.1. Submit major voice system requirements, to include upgrades,
          modifications, and expansion, as well as requirements that cannot be solved at the
          host-base to the MAJCOM for review and approval, and to the STEM-B according to
          AFI 33-101, Commanders Guidance and Responsibilities, for inclusion in the
          Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning System blueprint.
          11.1.1.2. Requests for Video Teleconferencing system procurement and connection
          to the voice networks, to include the voice system, will follow guidelines outlined in
          AFI 33-117, Multimedia (MM) Management.
      11.1.2. Establish a competitive contract using AF IMT 9, Request for Purchase, or
      CSA using AF IMT 1218, Request for Communications Service. Headquarters 38th
      Engineering Installation Group at Tinker AFB OK, is the current Air Force contracting
      agency for issuing CSAs. A CSA is needed in areas where a public utility commission
      requires tariffed or regulated services (e.g., central office trunking, business lines, foreign
      exchange [FX] service). Ensure funds are available and certified prior to contract award.
      Use AF IMT 1218 to establish new CSAs or to submit changes to existing CSAs.
      11.1.3. Solicit and obtain competitive bids or proposals through designated and
      appropriate procurement channels for all voice services.
      11.1.4. Ensure Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Primary Rate Interface (PRI)
      and European (Euro)-PRI provisions are included for voice network enterprise
      connections (local, long distance, and DSN) in a competitive contract vehicle or CSA.
      11.1.5. Ensure that the special telephone and voice requirements for people with
      disabilities are addressed according to 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1194.23 of
      the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, document, December
      21, 2000 (http:// www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm).
   11.2. MAJCOMs will:
      11.2.1. Establish procedures ensuring new or changes to existing CSAs are consistent
      with the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Plan and
      schedule timely establishment and/or renewal of telephone service contracts with
      required agencies and the contracting officer (DFARS Part 239, Acquisition of
      Information Technology, Subpart 239.74, Telecommunications Services).
      11.2.2. Monitor CSAs under their control for adequate funding authority and to ensure
      that decentralized reporting of expenditures is accomplished as prescribed by the
      contracting officer.

12. Competitive Long Distance Voice Service. When FTS-2001 (or its designated
replacement) service is not available (e.g., certain outside the continental United States
locations), follow the guidelines in AFI 33-116, Long-Haul Telecommunications Management,
to request competitive long distance voice service. MAJCOMs may provide flat rate, long
distance, non-reimbursable voice service to tenants authorized Class A-1 service if the host base
also uses this service. When the host base does not require flat rate, long distance service, such a
service is a special requirement and the tenant must pay for it.

  against private misuse exist, and that the service is necessary for direct support of the
  agency’s mission.
     16.2.1. Unit commanders, in coordination with the local personnel office, may authorize
     federal civilian employees to work at an approved flexiplace location. Unit commanders
     may also authorize the installation of a personal computer, applicable software, modems,
     fax machines, and data lines to support access at the alternate work location (PL 104-52.)
     Unit commanders should work with the supporting communications unit to identify the
     necessary support requirements and restrictions.
     16.2.2. The unit commander authorizing the alternate work location must:
         16.2.2.1. Determine government-provided communications service is necessary for
         direct support of the agency’s mission.
         16.2.2.2. Fund necessary equipment and phone lines needed to support the mission.
         16.2.2.3. Make sure the alternate work location is an economical option to having the
         individual work in the office.
         16.2.2.4. Authorize payment for installation and monthly recurring charges.
         16.2.2.5. Certify that adequate monitoring capability and safeguards against private
         misuse exist. Such certification should accompany a signed federal civilian
         employees flexiplace agreement.
         16.2.2.6. Account for government-provided equipment on a hand receipt and

18. Air Force Guidance on Voice Mail/Messaging Systems.
   18.1. When procuring new or replacement stand-alone Voice Mail/Messaging Systems
   (VMS), installations will integrate with either the base voice system or the telephone service
   provider.
   18.2. Communications units should evaluate the base-wide requirement for voice mail and
   plan for a centralized solution.
   18.3. When evaluating options for satisfying user needs, the analysis must examine service
   and total cost of ownership to acquire, install, and sustain the system over its expected life
   cycle.
   18.4. The MAJCOM/SC (or equivalent) can approve a waiver to purchase new or expand
   existing stand-alone VMS when the mission and business case is compelling and documented
   to be the best value to the Air Force.

19. Air Force Guidance on Music on Hold.
   19.1. Any primary broadcast of music (e.g., music played directly from tape, compact disc,
   or other source) into a voice system must comply with licensing and copyright requirements
   under applied Federal, state, and local laws.
      19.1.1. The use of royalty-free music is highly recommended. However, broadcasts
      from the Air Force News Agency are the preferred solution wherever possible. The Air
      Force News Agency provides an ―Air Force Radio News on Hold‖ service that can be
      feed into most Air Force switches. Please contact Air Force News, AFNEWS/NSOE,
      DSN 945-1363, for further information concerning the Air Force Radio News broadcasts.
   19.2. Prior to approving rebroadcast of music into a voice system, the installation
   commander should consider the potential for complaints of preferential treatment or implied
   endorsement by the Air Force based upon the choice of radio station, and the potential for
   negative public reaction to broadcasts that may contain controversial, offensive, or political
   content.

21. Air Force Instruction on Lead Telecommunications Cables. The following applies:
   21.1. For Commercial Telephone Company-Owned Cables:
      21.1.1. Do not accept ―abandoned‖ cables from any commercial telephone company
      without first consulting your base legal office, base civil engineering environmental
      flight, installation bio-environmental engineer, the environmental management office,
      and MAJCOM. Abandoned cables often contain materials (i.e., lead) which are
      environmental hazards. Accepting ownership may make the Air Force responsible for its
      removal and liable for any damages caused by the hazardous materials.
   21.2. For Government-Owned Cables:
      21.2.1. Coordinate with base civil engineering environmental flight or environmental
      management office, and the installation bio-environmental engineer before repairing,
      excavating, or removing cables suspected of containing lead. The environmental
      engineering team can offer advice on how to minimize health risks and Air Force
      liability.
22. Air Force Guidance on Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Implementation.
   22.1. When available from the applicable carrier and economically feasible, installations will
   transition existing external enterprise voice network connections (local PSTN, long distance,
   DSN, etc.) from standard T-1 service to ISDN PRI or Euro-ISDN (for applicable bases in the
   European theater). Ensure PRI service is provisioned for dynamic voice and data capability.
      22.1.1. All future upgrades, expansion, or additions of external enterprise voice network
      connection requirements will be installed using ISDN PRI or Euro-ISDN (as applicable).
      The base CSO or designated representative will ensure new contracts and CSAs include
      provisions to allow insertion of ISDN PRI or Euro-ISDN technology to the supported
      voice information system.
      22.1.2. To support end-to-end network feature transparency, any applicable intra-base
      enterprise voice network connections (e.g., from end office switch to PBX1 or PBX2)
      should also be transitioned to ISDN PRI or Euro-PRI, as required. All new intra-base
      enterprise voice network connections should also be installed as ISDN PRI or Euro-PRI,
      as required.

24. Air Force Instruction on Malicious Call Trace (MCT) or Customer Originated Trace.
   24.1. The host CSO will establish local MCT procedures to address harassing, prank, bomb
   threat, 911 hang-ups, or other emergency type calls that need to be identified.
   24.2. Procedures should be clearly published in the base telephone directory and on
   appropriate visual aid forms posted next to the AF Form 440, Bomb Threat Aid.
   24.3. The host CSO must work with the local security forces, Office of Special
   Investigations, and Staff Judge Advocate, to ensure responsibilities are outlined and
   appropriate equipment (e.g., line printers) are installed in designated places.
   24.4. For standardization purposes from base-to-base, all sites will utilize the access code
   feature *57 to initiate a MCT. If an existing voice switch already has *57 assigned for
   another feature, reassign the existing feature a new access code and ensure *57 when MCT is
   used.
   24.5. When a MCT is activated by an end user on base and the originating calling number is
   not displayed or unknown, applicable law enforcement personnel should immediately contact
   the telephone maintenance office for additional assistance. When contacted by law
   enforcement, these personnel can utilize other tools (e.g., voice protection system [VPS],
   TMS, switch logs, etc.) to help trace calls that are either still on-line or have hung up.
25. Air Force Instruction on Single-Line Telephone Concept Implementation.
   25.1. Air Force sites will take maximum advantage of the host telephone switch and features
   to replace smaller PBXs and key systems. Any upgrade or replacement of existing PBXs or
   key systems will be with an Internet Protocol (IP) capable solution. Sites will provide
   AFNIC/ECNV a 5 year plan to eliminate key systems and PBXs to capitalize on IP
   convergence capabilities.
   25.2. Requirements for new key systems at locations served by a host switch or PBX will
   require AFNIC/ECNV approval. AFNIC/ECNV may approve the purchase of new key
   systems only when the key system provides the best overall solution to satisfy the operational
   requirement. AFNIC/ECNV will keep waivers for new key systems on file.

6215.01B approval. According to CJCSI 6215.01B, Priority and Immediate Precedence require
service chief (formerly called CINC) approval. Flash and Flash Override require Joint Staff
approval. CJCSI 6215.01B, has the format for submitting your DSN Precedence request,
required supporting data, and appropriate approval authority.
   32.1. AFNIC/ECNV is the entry point for Air Force CONUS DSN CJCSI 6215.01B
   Precedence request. Submit requests according to the format prescribed in the CJCSI
   6215.01B with the required approval to AFNIC/ECNV for processing. Without the
   appropriate approval, AFNIC cannot process the request.
   32.2. AFNIC/ECNV will review the requirement and coordinate with AFNIC/ECL to ensure
   the DSN common user funds are available to pay the associated monthly precedence billing
   charge. If the requirement is validated, with funds available to support it, AFNIC/ECNV will
   forward the request up to the approval authority as indicated in CJCSI 6215.01C.
33. Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Instruction. AFNIC/ECNV is the SAF/CIO A6

Section C—Voice Networks and Access Requirements

34. Air Force Instruction on Commercial Long Distance Networks. The following applies:
   34.1. When available, the use of the FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement) network is
   mandatory for DOD and Air Force non-command and control inter-base switched voice
   communications, unless service can be provided on a dedicated common-user system without
   expenditure of appropriated funds to expand the network.
   34.2. Use AFI 33-116 and DISA Circular (DISAC) 310-130-1, Submission of
   Telecommunication Service Requests, to develop and process requests for FTS-2001 service
   (or its designated replacement).
   34.3. Send all approved requests for FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement) service
   through the host MAJCOM/FOA circuit actions office prior to forwarding to the appropriate
   DISA office for processing. You can obtain copies of DISA publications at https://disa-
   ca.dtic.mil/pubs/ (.gov/.mil restricted).
   34.4. PIN use is mandatory when making commercial long distance or toll telephone calls to
   better control and reduce the overall cost the Air Force pays for long distance telephone calls.
   Under this instruction, MAJCOMs will ensure their bases develop, implement, and control
   PIN assignments to authorized users. The MAJCOM has the authority to grant, in writing,
   PIN assignment waiver authority to the base CSO. For a base granted a PIN assignment
   waiver, the CSO will have in place procedures for implementing the waiver process. All PIN
   waivers will be review/revalidated annually by the MAJCOM. Program all digital voice
   switching systems to accept PINs for processing long distance or toll calls. PIN length will
   be no less than six numeric or alphanumeric characters.
35. Air Force Instruction on Use of Toll-Free (800, 888, 877 or 866) Numbers. The
following applies:
   35.1. Authorized for official business only. Do not advertise toll free numbers to
   unauthorized organizations or personnel to use for ―easier‖ unofficial toll free access to the
   installation resources.
   35.2. Order new toll free numbers from the FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement)
   contract. Submit requirements according to AFI 33-116.
   35.3. Include total monthly billing and usage charges for all toll free numbers on the
   installation’s monthly FTS-2001 bill (or its designated replacement). If warranted, monthly
   service and usage charges for dedicated toll free numbers can be reimbursed by using
   organizations.
   35.4. Do not install toll free numbers to modems unless provisions in are fully met.
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                               25


   35.5. See for related security restrictions on voice mail systems.
   35.6. Area codes 880, 881, 882 are not toll free and are not authorized for toll free usage.
   These codes provide a way to extend toll-free calling beyond the borders of the country in
   which the party paying for the calls resides. These codes are used primarily to allow
   Caribbean callers to reach toll-free numbers in the United States. With this arrangement, the
   caller pays for the international segment of the call (to the US gateway), and the called party
   pays for the remainder.
36. Air Force Instruction for Use of 900 Telephone Numbers. The following applies:
   36.1. Authorized for official business only.
   36.2. MAJCOM establishes approval authority.
   36.3. Follow the guidelines established in paragraph 13. for long distance calling.
   36.4. For direct dialing of 900 telephone numbers, the following guidelines apply:
       36.4.1. Establish a separate class of service for 900-number capabilities.
       36.4.2. Establish customer account codes for each organization with 900-number
       capabilities.
       36.4.3. Establish an authorization code for each user authorized to dial 900 numbers.
   36.5. DELETED.
37. DSN Access. DISAC 310-225-1, DSN User Services Guide, publishes management
guidelines for the DSN network access thresholds.
   37.1. The ratio of FLASH OVERRIDE and FLASH DSN Precedence Access Threshold
   (PAT) settings versus number of users will be one for one to ensure non-blocking access for
   these type calls.
   37.2. The ratio of IMMEDIATE and PRIORITY DSN PAT settings versus number of users
   will be no higher than those listed in DISAC 310-225-1.
   37.3. Process all requests for precedence access above Routine to the host MAJCOM for
   endorsement and subsequent forwarding to the lead command manager. Follow the
   procedures in CJCSI 6215.01B for submission procedures.
   37.4. Follow policy and procedures in DODI 8100.3, to ensure all voice systems and
   associated peripheral devices are certified by the JITC as interoperable with the DSN and IA
   accredited prior to connection. Connection is defined as the ability to originate or terminate a
   DSN call.
38. Air Force Instruction on Defense Switched Network (DSN) and Commercial Dialing
Standard. All sites must comply with the following standard DSN and commercial network
access dialing plan. All existing voice systems will transition to, and new systems will be
installed to, support the requirements for the following DSN and Commercial network access
digits:
90 DSN FLASH OVERRIDE

      or changes to existing hardware according to AFMAN 14-304 and DODD 5000.1, The
      Defense Acquisition System, May 12, 2003.
      41.2.6. MAJCOMs approve secure terminal equipment such as Telecommunications
      Service Priority System-2000. Base CSOs approve secure terminal equipment such as
      STEs, VINSON, PARKHILL, and Digital Subscriber Voice Terminal.
          41.2.6.1. Order STEs and supporting key material per AFI 33-201, Volume 9,
          Operational Instructions for Secure Voice Devices. MAJCOMs must inform users of
          security limitations for their facilities.
          41.2.6.2. AFMAN 14-304 gives procedures for processing sensitive compartmented
          information (SCI) requirements. Use secure voice systems to secure information up
          to and including TOP SECRET/SCI.
          41.2.6.3. MAJCOMs manage secure telephone service in motor vehicles.
          41.2.6.4. To minimize security risks, MAJCOMs must implement and follow
          appropriate pro-cedures in national directives; DODDs; AFMAN 14-304; AFPD 33-

       secure voice systems or equipment to AFNIC/ECNV for evaluation. This procedure
       applies to all hardware, firmware, and software recommendations to secure voice
       systems.
       41.3.2. After evaluating suggestions, AFNIC/ECNV processes them according to
       directives and publications.
       41.3.3. AFNIC/ECNV coordinates recommendations with Headquarters Air Force
       Materiel Command before getting HQ USAF approval.

Section E—Telephone Monitoring and Recording Procedures

42. Categories. Authorization to monitor or record telephone lines is determined by the
purpose of the request or nature of the interception. Three sets of authorizations and procedures
govern monitoring and recording telephone conversations:
   42.1. OPSEC Vulnerability Monitoring. See AFI 33-219, Telecommunications Monitoring
   and Assessment Program (TMAP); DODD 4640.6, Communications Security Telephone
   Monitoring and Recording, June 26, 1981; and AFPD 33-2, for information on monitoring
   and recording procedures for OPSEC purposes. Headquarters Air Intelligence Agency
   TMAP elements (including its gained reserve units), are the only Air Force organizations
   authorized to conduct TMAP activities.
   42.2. Criminal Investigations. See AFI 71-101, Volume 1, Criminal Investigations, and
   DODD 5505.9, Interception of Wire, Electronic, and Oral Communications for Law
   Enforcement, April 20, 1995, for guidelines on using the interception of telephone services
   for technical surveillance activities supporting law enforcement. Procedures for law
   enforcement activities to request telephone call tracing information, including bomb threats,
   are outlined in DOD O-5505.9-M (FOUO). When authorized, the base CSO can utilize
   existing tools (VPS, TMS, etc.) to assist law enforcement personnel in tracing malicious or
   suspicious calls. The base CSO, or designated representative, must coordinate with Security
   Forces and Office of Special Investigations to establish local procedures compliant with the
   above directives.
   42.3. DELETED.
       42.3.1. DELETED.
43. Controlling Monitoring and Recording. Activities monitoring and recording telephone
conversations must:
   43.1. Use acquired information only to accomplish the Air Force or DOD mission.
   43.2. Allocate funds for telephone monitoring, recording equipment, and necessary
   operations and maintenance expenses.
   43.3. Control access to recorded media.
   43.4. Notify appropriate individuals if a doubt exists that a party is not aware of the
   recording and monitoring practices. Publish recording practices in the base telephone
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                               29


   directory advising users that use of government telephones constitutes consent by the user to
   COMSEC monitoring.
   43.5. Mark recorded media with the appropriate classification and handle according to
   security directives.
   43.6. Destroy recorded data as soon as possible, consistent with operational need, normally
   within 30 days after recording.
44. Prohibited Monitoring and Recording Activities. You will not:
   44.1. Record conversations for other than information management purposes (meeting
   minutes, action items, technical discussions and/or documentation of key decisions) during
   routine, in garrison operations. All recording activities are prohibited without prior
   notification to all parties of your recording intentions. Incidental monitoring of telephone
   conversations is limited to that necessary to perform quality control checks. When
   monitoring, voice systems personnel must inform all parties of their presence on the line, the
   reason for monitoring, and when they exit the circuit.
   44.2. Monitor telephone conversations to determine whether the communication is for
   official purposes. The policy that DOD telephones are to be used to conduct official business
   is enforced through administrative and management techniques such as analysis or records,
   periodic briefings, and supervisory controls.
   44.3. Use pen registers, or similar equipment, for law enforcement purposes in accordance
   with AFI 71-101, Volume 1, and DODD 5505.9.
45. Requesting Exceptions to Recording Policy. Request waivers to this policy from
SAF/XCIF, 1800 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1800.
46. Unauthorized Monitoring or Recording Devices. The discovery of unauthorized
monitoring or a suspected device is classified SECRET/NOFORN (Not Releasable to Foreign
Nationals). If you discover or suspect that individuals are using unauthorized monitoring or
recording devices:
   46.1. Leave the device or wires in place and secure the area to prevent tampering or removal.
   46.2. Notify the nearest AFOSI office by the most secure means available; do this from
   outside the affected area (see AFI 71-101, Volume 1).
   46.3. Do not disseminate information concerning suspected monitoring or recording devices
   without specific authorization of the USAF Technical Surveillance Countermeasures
   (TSCM) Program Administrator at HQ AFOSI. Brief only personnel with a need to know
   and hold these briefings at the local AFOSI office or at a location determined by the USAF
   TSCM Program Administrator.
   46.4. Continue normal activity in the area consistent with essential security precautions.
   46.5. Contact local telephone representatives for assistance only when directed by the wing
   commander or AFOSI personnel.

Section F— Billing for Telephone and Other Commercial Communications Services
 30                                                   AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


47. Verifying Bills. There are many types of commercial communications services that are
billed to the Air Force. The following procedures are designed specifically for telephone service.
Bases should adopt and use these procedures, where applicable, for other commercial services
such as CTs, International Maritime Satellite, etc.
   47.1. Billing and Paying. Federal agencies must pay applicable interest or late charges if
   they do not make payments by due dates. The receiving unit (addressee) must date-stamp all
   telephone company bills immediately on receipt. Use the date-stamp to determine the
   payment due date when a tariff or contract does not show a due date. The CSO or a
   designated representative certifies the bill’s accuracy before sending it to the base FSO for
   payment. Each organization’s IMPAC billing official will verify the accuracy of CT bills
   paid using the IMPAC prior to paying the bill. The following guidelines apply:
       47.1.1. Title 31 U.S.C., Section 3901, Prompt Payment Act.
           47.1.1.1. Submit certified bills to the FSO for payment not later than (NLT) 6
           working days before the due date.
           47.1.1.2. Where a state’s public utilities commission or other regulatory agency has
           approved a late payment tariff, use the tariff due date. You must pay late charges if
           you don’t pay the bill by the due date.
           47.1.1.3. Where you purchase or lease services or equipment under a contract, make
           the payment by the date specified in the contract. When the contract has no tariff or
           contract due date, make the payment NLT 30 days after you receive it. If a bill is not
           date-stamped, make the payment NLT 30 days after the invoice date.
       47.1.2. FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement) Billing Procedures. Each CONUS
       MAJCOM/ SC, (or equivalent), must establish a local facility program designator code
       for each base in coordination with the base CSO. This procedure keeps funding control
       at the user level, with the base CSO issuing funding authority to the Defense Information
       Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) annually.
           47.1.2.1. Billing procedures. Each month the contractor gives the base the call detail
           record (CDR). DITCO gives the CSO the customer cost and obligation data. The
           CSO has 10 days to dispute charges.
               47.1.2.1.1. Given no billing discrepancies, DITCO charges the base using
               transaction for others (TFO) or transaction by others (TBO) procedures.
               47.1.2.1.2. If billing discrepancies do not exceed $1,000, DITCO still charges the
               base using TFO or TBO procedures. DITCO gives the base a credit after
               resolving the dispute.
               47.1.2.1.3. If billing discrepancies are equal to or more than $1,000:
                  47.1.2.1.3.1. DITCO adjusts the base’s bill if they agree the charges are
                  incorrect.
                  47.1.2.1.3.2. The appropriate base authority settles each unresolved
                  discrepancy on a case-by-case basis if DITCO disagrees. Disburse the
                  undisputed amount using TFO or TBO procedures. The base has 60 days to
                  present evidence to DITCO regarding the disputed amount before paying the
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                                31


                   bill using TFO or TBO procedures.
           47.1.2.2. Resolving FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement) CDR disputes. The
           CSO documents disputes not resolved during the 10-day period by preparing an
           adjustment request and sending it to DISA/DITCO/RRA, 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB
           IL 62225-5406. DITCO must receive the adjustment request within 60 days of
           receiving the CDR. Notify the CSO when the parties reach resolution and you make
           adjustments.
       47.1.3. Collection for Unauthorized Use of FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement).
       Compute the cost of all unofficial FTS-2001 calls on the basis of the commercial rate of
       the FTS-2001 service provider. Also calculate the administrative costs of determining
       the call was unauthorized, plus the cost of processing the collection. If the unit collects
       the cost of the unauthorized call before receiving the bill, the CSO deposits the payment
       into the Appropriation or Suspense Account 57X6500 and transfers funds from the
       suspense account to the appropriation that paid the bill.
48. Processing the Bills. The communications unit (addressee) separates the telephone bills
into groups (i.e., recurring, nonrecurring, FTS-2001 [or its designated replacement] long distance
direct-dial or equivalent service, and specialized or dedicated equipment or service) for historical
comparison or verification. The CSO will:
   48.1. Certify the voucher (Standard Form [SF] 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and
   Services Other Than Personal) and send to the FSO for processing.
   48.2. Maintain a monthly summary spreadsheet showing the totals of individual monthly
   spreadsheets (including automated or manual spreadsheets) for different types of charges
   (e.g., recurring, FTS-2001 [or its designated replacement], tolls).
49. Judgmental Sampling of “Toll” Calls. The CSO will establish local verification
procedures to certify bills or categories of bills (e.g., repetitive one-time service bills for
installation, removal, or relocation of instruments) as official. The CSO need not verify every
―toll‖ call. The CSO may use other procedures, such as a statistical sampling or historical data,
to satisfy the requirement if they provide a high degree of reliability or certainty that certified
calls were official.
50. Federal Telecommunications System (FTS)-2001 Verification. Use a judgmental
sampling to verify bills for FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement). The General Services
Administration (GSA) is the government’s contracting agency for the FTS-2001 and disburses
funds to the contractor. GSA states that the government is liable for all calls placed over the
FTS-2001. The purpose of verification is not to certify the bill for payment but to protect the
system from abuse by collecting payment from those making unofficial calls. Credit the amount
collected to the account that originally paid the bill. Once a month DITCO distributes a hard
copy of the FTS-2001 bill to the communications units. An electronic copy is also available
from DITCO. CSOs should automate the process of verifying the bill.
51. Verifying Other Charges, Credits, Local Service, and Equipment Charges (Recurring
and Nonrecurring Charges). At some bases, the telephone bill includes bulk message unit
charges for directory assistance calls, dial 99 access, and interzone calls. Handle these charges
as an additional cost to the city trunk bill. The base CSO or a designated representative (not the
 32                                                 AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


billing activity) compares charges for billed local service and equipment with government
records and CSAs or other contracts.
   51.1. Comparing Billing. Use the date and nature of the service to compare items charged to
   the authorization document. The base CSO (not the billing activity):
      51.1.1. Compares dates on the ―explanation of other charges and credits‖ with the dates
      shown on the corresponding authorization document (e.g., Department of Defense [DD]
      Form 1367, Communication Work Order, Commercial; and AF IMT 9).
      51.1.2. Compares nonrecurring and monthly recurring charges with those authorized on
      the corresponding authorization document (contract or DD Form 428, Communication
      Service Authorization).
      51.1.3. Compares fractional charges and credits for service started or discontinued
      (nonrecurring charges) based on monthly rates.
   51.2. Correcting Differences. To correct differences in entries on the ―explanation of other
   charges and credits:‖
      51.2.1. Enter the appropriate charge and the date of changes if the authorization
      document is incorrect.
      51.2.2. Return the authorization document to the issuing agency with a letter explaining
      the required correction if the contract is wrong.
52. Verifying Commercial Long Distance Calls, Federal Telecommunications System
(FTS)-2000/ 2001, or Equivalent Charges With AF IMT 1072 or AF IMT 649, Verification
of Long Distance Telephone Calls.
   52.1. Unofficial Toll Calls. The Air Force will not pay for unofficial toll calls placed from
   official telephones except over the FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement). For unofficial
   toll calls, the base:
      52.1.1. Communications unit tries to find out who placed the unauthorized calls, and if
      necessary, asks the telephone company for help.
      52.1.2. Communications unit helps unit commanders identify those making unofficial
      calls and gives a list of these individuals to the FSO for collection. The list includes
      name, social security number, unit of assignment, date of the call, city and number called,
      and amount owed. Ensure Title 5 U.S.C., Section 552a, Privacy Act of 1974, procedures
      are followed.
      52.1.3. The FSO collects the unofficial total charge and deposits payment into Suspense
      Account 57X6500 and sends a copy of DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, to the
      billing activity.
      52.1.4. Billing activity cites the amount collected and the suspense account on the next
      payment voucher.
      52.1.5. Refers remaining unidentified calls to a telephone company representative. The
      referral document includes a written statement that investigation prohibits payment
      because the calls were unauthorized and that the Air Force judges that further
      investigation or collection efforts are not justified.
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                                33


   52.2. Class B Service Billing. The base CSO sends the certified billing statement and Class
   B billing information to the base FSO for processing.
       52.2.1. The FSO collects charges for the toll calls in Suspense Account 57X6500 and
       cites the suspense account for the next payment voucher to the telephone company.
       52.2.2. The billing activity cites this suspense account when preparing the payment
       voucher to pay the telephone company.
53. Adjusting Billing Errors. The billing activity advises the commercial telephone company
of billing errors.
   53.1. Resolving Discrepancies. The billing activity promptly resolves billing discrepancies
   in favor of the government. Contact the contracting officer for resolution when you cannot
   correct discrepancies.
   53.2. Correcting Billing Errors. The billing activity deletes or corrects incorrect billing with
   the agreement of the commercial telephone company. The billing activity initials each
   deletion or correction before paying. If the clerk cannot get the telephone company to orally
   agree to changing a charge, the CSO certifies only the undisputed portion of the bill.
54. Sending Bills to the Financial Service Office (FSO). The billing activity:
   54.1. Prepares SF 1034 for the total amount paid against each contract number and has the
   base CSO certify the voucher for payment.
   54.2. Enters the amount to pay for telephone services from appropriated funds. Does not
   include Federal tax. Shows State tax as a separate item. Enters the grand total.
   54.3. Enters the appropriate contract number and date in the column headed ―Number and
   Date of Order.‖
   54.4. Enters the basic agreement number in the ―Contract Number‖ block and the 4-digit
   authorization number and date from the ―Authorization Number and Date‖ block of the DD
   Form 428, in the column headed ―Number and Date of Order‖ where a CSA is the
   contracting authority.
   54.5. Forwards one copy of the CSO-certified SF 1034 to the contracting office that issued
   the CSA and puts one copy in a suspense file until the base FSO pays the bill. Unless
   substantial differences occur between the amount shown on the SF 1034 and the amount
   actually paid, the contracting office will use the certified SF 1034 to effect contract reporting
   requirements. If substantial differences occur, a copy of the SF 1034 indicating what was
   actually paid will be furnished to the contracting officer to permit corrections. In lieu of
   individual SF 1034 vouchers, the MAJCOMs or bases may consolidate monthly payment
   data, electronically or hard copy, and forward the data to the contracting officer.
   54.6. Keeps the commercial telephone company bills and supporting documentation with the
   file copy of the SF 1034. Disposes of the voucher and documentation according to Web-
   RIM RDS located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm. If a telephone company
   issues more than one bill with the same address, lists all of the bills on one SF 1034.
   54.7. This process does not apply to bills paid with the IMPAC.
55. Certifying Payment on Standard Form (SF) 1034.
 34                                                    AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   55.1. For toll calls, the base CSO or a designated representative certifies all calls.
   55.2. The wing commander or deputy commander for resources designates a certifying
   officer on DD Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record-Authorized Signature. Do
   not delegate this authority. File a DD Form 577 for anyone authorized to sign the payment
   voucher.
   55.3. Alternate Payment Procedure:
      55.3.1. When an automated system prints the SF 1034, or if the CSO wants to pass the
      billing information through electronic means to the Defense Accounting Office (DAO),
      the CSO signs a transmittal letter stating the amount for payment is correct.
      55.3.2. The DAO prepares the payment voucher using the automated accounting system
      and attaches the letter from the CSO.
      55.3.3. The CSO continues to maintain the backup files.
      55.3.4. Send only the original and two copies of the first page of the telephone bill with
      the correct amount entered.
      55.3.5. Contact your DAO for further information concerning the automated accounting
      system process.
56. Coinless or Coinbox Telephone Revenue. Deposit commission revenue from coinless or
coinbox telephones managed by appropriated fund activities to Receipt Account 573210.0200
using DD Form 1131. You will not credit this revenue to the monthly telephone bill.
   56.1. Where AAFES manages coinless or coinbox telephones, AAFES monitors, controls,
   and reimburses these revenues to the government through the MWRS account using AFI 34-
   211(I), Army and Air Force Exchange Service General Policies.
   56.2. The base CSO provides information to AAFES regarding the number of government-
   owned cable pairs used to provide pay phone service and the amount of compensation due,
   and ensures that the government receives compensation from the contractor.
57. Charges for Base Telephone Services. See Attachment 5.

Section G—Security of Voice systems and Networks

58. General Security Instruction.
   58.1. All telephone maintenance and voice network operations personnel (regardless of
   position or location) will:
      58.1.1. Be familiar with the security features, available tools, components, and assistance
      available in protecting the voice networks and related switching platforms and facilities.
      58.1.2. Evaluate and fully understand all components of the voice information system
      and voice networks in order to minimize the vulnerability of unauthorized access, use,
      and improper installation practices.
          58.1.2.1. At a minimum, these components include the switchroom,
          telecommunications closets, voice information system, Information Transport Nodes,
          associated power equipment, digital cross-connect devices (e.g., DSX panel, CSUs),
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                              35


          peripheral equipment (e.g., voice messaging/mail systems, TMS), and auxiliary
          components such as fax machines, modems, recorded announcement equipment,
          printers, terminals, and computers.
   58.2. Implement a voice systems security program that addresses all aspects of security and
   information assurance practices, to include commercial, Air Force and DOD.
      58.2.1. Use AFI 33-220, On-Hook Telephone Security, for guidance on installing voice
      systems and associated peripheral and customer premise devices in sensitive or classified
      information processing areas.
      58.2.2. For voice systems that provide access to the DSN, the local security program will
      also implement DSN Security Technical Information Guide (STIG), DSN Security
      Guide, and associated DSN Security Checklist thresholds for protection of the DSN
      network. Identify all conflicts of security policies to AFNIC/ECNV at
      afnic.ecnv@us.af.mil.
      58.2.3. For voice systems that implement packet-switching services, only certified VoIP
      appliances can be connected to the DSN. The local security program will also include
      VoIP STIG guidance and directives. Identify all conflicts of security policies to
      AFNIC/ECNV, at afnic.ecnv@us.af.mil.
   58.3. Evaluate the security program using a self-inspection checklist at least semi-annually.
   58.4. Ensure voice networks and key switching assets are frequently monitored to identify
   changing calling patterns, system uses and intrusion attempts, and other possible security
   risks that pose a possible threat to the operation of the voice information system.
59. Voice Protection System (VPS).
   59.1. The NOSC will:
      59.1.1. Provide centralized management and administration of the VPS platform.
      59.1.2. Operate and manage the VPS platform according to AFI 33-115, Volume 1 and
      with centrally provided Technical Orders (TOs).
      59.1.3. Administer/disseminate Air Force and MAJCOM-wide VPS rule sets and site-
      specific guidance for each base and GSU in the MAJCOM enterprise.
      59.1.4. Modify the active VPS rule set as directed by higher headquarters to react to
      events, anomalies, and emergencies.
      59.1.5. Maintain trained system administrators proficient in maintaining the server’s
      operating system and VPS platform specific software.
      59.1.6. Utilize the platform to generate command-wide reports (as needed) and ensure
      real time visibility of voice networks.
   59.2. The host Communications Squadron will:
      59.2.1. Utilize the VPS platform to: run applicable base-level reports, assist the
      MAJCOM NOSC in troubleshooting network and security events, track local utilization
      of special numbers or services (modem, fax, secure voice, etc.), and perform other related
      tasks.
 36                                                AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


      59.2.2. Ensure all common-user external voice trunks (DSN, DRSN, and PSTN) and
      individual commercial (also known as Foreign Exchange) analog lines are physically
      rerouted into VPS appliances. NOTE: Commercial analog lines are those individual
      phone numbers that receive their dial tone from an external off-base PSTN switch, but
      have been physically routed to the base (usually via copper lines). Only those individual
      commercial lines that are directly funded or leased by the government and appear on
      desktops with ―af.mil‖ access need to be routed through the VPS appliances. Do not
      install commercial analog numbers into VPS appliances that are generally used as
      ―hotlines‖ to other emergency or safety response centers (e.g., an Air Traffic Control
      hotline to the Federal Aviation Administration regional center) and commercial lines paid
      for by private entities on base (AAFES, banks, credit unions, etc.).
      59.2.3. Ensure any new planned expansion (or modification) of external voice trunking
      and/or commercial line requirements includes the cost of new VPS appliance equipment,
      installation, and software licenses (as needed). Connect new trunks or lines to the VPS
      appliance rack for installation.
   59.3. Blocking or Masking of Select Phone Numbers.
      59.3.1. When bases need to block outbound access to a phone number or series of
      numbers (e.g., known toll fraud/scam numbers, toll free dial around and 976 numbers),
      send requested numbers to the MAJCOM NOSC VPS administrator.
      59.3.2. The MAJCOM NOSC will review requests and work with the AFNOSC to
      determine Air Force-wide impact. The AFNOSC will issue either a Time Compliance
      Network Order or Command, Control, Communications and Computer Notice to Airmen
      to have numbers blocked in all VPS platforms when it’s an Air Force-wide (or potential
      Air Force-wide) issue. When it’s determined to be a local or regional issue, selected
      MAJCOMs will block numbers in their own VPS platform. See AFI 33-138, Enterprise
      Network Operations Notification and Tracking, for additional reporting requirements.
      59.3.3. Blocking of inbound numbers (e.g., spamming fax lines, known telemarketing
      numbers) is available as well, as long as site external trunks are ISDN PRI based. Use the
      same procedures in paragraphs 59.3.1 and 59.3.2, to block selected inbound numbers.
      59.3.4. When masking of internal Caller ID numbers leaving the base is required, do not
      mask or change numbers in the switching software. Submit requests to the MAJCOM
      NOSC VPS administrator to have the VPS platform mask or input a generic Caller ID
      number on outbound ISDN PRI trunks. This allows the VPS platform to better support
      real time malicious call tracing of base numbers and also enables better reporting of
      outbound call trends from base users.
      59.3.5. Follow MAJCOM and local procedures for upgrades, expansions, or other
      changes to the base trunking. Also, ensure these actions are coordinated with NOSC VPS
      administrator.
60. Installation and Identification of Modem, Fax, and Secure Voice (Analog) Lines.
   60.1. Organizations at all levels will ensure all Remote Access Server numbers and
   authorized existing and newly installed modem, fax, and secure voice analog lines (STU-III,
   STE, Future Narrow Band Digital Terminal, etc.) are identified and submitted to the host
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                           37


   base CSO and MAJCOM NOSC for loading into the VPS platform. Any of the above lines
   not identified by the base may result in their automatic disconnection by the VPS platform.
      60.1.1. Modems must be approved through the base DAA before it is considered
      authorized.
   60.2. All requests submitted to the NOSC for new modem lines must include the using
   organization and office symbol. Modem lines for contractors must also include the name and
   voice number of a government person or quality assurance evaluator (QAE) officially
   requesting/validating the modem line. All modem lines will be classified as either being:
      60.2.1. Mission Critical: Modem lines deemed absolutely mission critical to the
      continued operation of a system or function. Example: Modem lines without routine or
      continued modem access, applicable mission will fail or cause very serious degradation.
      60.2.2. Mission Essential: Modem lines that are used to support or enhance mission
      effectiveness. Example: Modem lines or functions that would not be routinely used
      during periods of minimum manning or reduced operations.
   60.3. Modem classification will help enable their quick identification and if warranted by
   INFOCON changes, result in their immediate base-wide disconnection.
   60.4. Ensure modem lines do not have any special features assigned to them such as call
   forwarding.
61. Password Procedures. (See AFSSI 8520, Identification and Authentication).
   61.1. Password Composition and Length. When technically feasible, the password must
   meet the requirements required by AFSSI 8520. When not capable of meeting these
   requirements, all passwords will meet as many of the individual requirements as possible.
   61.2. Password Change Rate. To protect against unknown threats, the maximum lifetime of
   a password must be no greater than 90 days.
   61.3. Change all passwords as soon as possible (maximum within one duty day) if a
   password compromise is suspected or confirmed. Remove a password as soon as possible
   (maximum within one duty day) if a user’s access is removed due to punitive action or via
   commander’s request.
   61.4. Disable/suspend a password as soon as possible (maximum within three duty days) if a
   user no longer requires access for a period greater than 90 days (e.g., TDY).
   61.5. Remove the user name and password immediately when a person no longer requires
   access for the performance of their job (e.g., permanent change of station, moves to another
   section, discharged). Ensure all root or administrative-level passwords are changed when a
   previous system administrator with this access departs for any reason.
   61.6. Password Grace Period. Password grace period is the number of logins into the system
   after a password has expired. The password grace period must be set to three where
   technically feasible. This forces the user to change their password after three grace period
   logins or be locked out of the system until the voice systems security administrator can
   reinstate them.
 38                                                  AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   61.7. Password Security. Do not write down passwords or store them in any easily
   accessible location (e.g., a function key). Do not share individual passwords.
62. Physical Access Procedures.
   62.1. Switchroom Access. Physical access to the switchroom is limited by the local
   communications unit to the fewest personnel required to accomplish the mission. This also
   applies to remote telephone switching facilities. Install cypher locks, or similar devices, on
   all doors that allow access to telephone switching facilities for access control.
   62.2. Maintenance Terminal Access. Limit access to maintenance terminals by the local
   communications unit to only the personnel that require access in the performance of their
   jobs. If possible, automatically log out terminals when idle for over 10 minutes or not in use.
   62.3. Identification and Authentication General Guidelines.
      62.3.1. The system design must contain no means of bypassing the identification and
      authentication mechanisms.
      62.3.2. After successful logon, present the user with the date and time of the last
      successful logon plus the number of unsuccessful attempts since that logon, where
      technically feasible.
      62.3.3. The switch must cease to respond to login attempts from any user (remote or
      otherwise) after three consecutive failed logon attempts, where technically feasible. The
      user will be locked out of the system until the voice systems security administrator can
      reinstate them.
      62.3.4. Issue real-time alarms or message alerts to all switch administrators of all
      repeated failed login attempts, where technically feasible.
      62.3.5. Establish procedures on how to deal with periods of inactivity on terminals. It is
      recommended, as a minimum, that remote terminals be disconnected after a specified
      period of inactivity.
   62.4. Discretionary Access General Guidelines. Use discretionary access to control access
   to the objects in the switch such as data tables and executable code modules after the users
   have gained access to the switch. This will usually be the authorized users such as
   maintainers and administrators. Discretionary access will limit the damage an unauthorized
   user might do who has defeated the identification and authentication mechanisms.
      62.4.1. Restrict access by time of day, day of week, and calendar date, if technically
      feasible.
      62.4.2. Restrict access based on terminal identifier to the minimum needed by the user’s
      function such as applications, operating system commands, or data tables. Also, restrict
      access to commands used to mount removable media to specific users such as the system
      administrator.
      62.4.3. Protect any switch services provided to subscribers such as direct inward system
      access by password or other authentication mechanisms.
   62.5. Specific Command Access Guidelines. Restrict access to voice information system
   commands based on the functions of the user. Accomplish this through class marking
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                           39


   commands according to their level of importance and criticality. Class mark all commands
   to prevent unauthorized system access. Do not use any manufacturer commands class mark
   defaults.
      62.5.1. Maintenance terminals in the telephone switchroom must have all privileges.
      This is to allow any level of maintenance to be performed from any device. Class
      marking user passwords and system commands can provide the level of protection
      required.
      62.5.2. Class mark maintenance terminals placed apart from the voice systems
      switchroom to only allow execution of commands needed to accomplish their function
      (e.g., subscriber feature changes, network analysis).
   62.6. ―Administrator‖ or ―Root‖ User. This is the most powerful user class available. It has
   unlimited access to all system commands, users, and resources; can override all other users,
   and carries the highest priority. Assign this function to only a few personnel (recommend no
   more than two or three). This is usually the work center supervisor or government telephone
   QAE (for contracted operations) to prevent compromise and security violations.
   62.7. Maintenance User. This is the most common user class in the central office. This user
   has access to all commands and resources necessary to perform the assigned maintenance
   actions (e.g., trunk maintenance, line maintenance, switch maintenance). Do not allow
   access to other user classes or allow manipulation to any secure logs or reports. This
   function is assigned to as many maintenance personnel as required to perform maintenance.
   62.8. Security Administrative User. This user has access to all user accounts, system
   monitoring commands, devices, and any secure logs or reports. Do not allow access to
   maintenance functions or other areas not required for the performance of this function. This
   function is limited to the voice systems security administrators only.
   62.9. DSN Network Administrator User. This user will be assigned at Air Force-operated
   and maintained Multi-Function Switches. User privileges will include access to commands
   and resources necessary for DISA to perform assigned maintenance, network management
   and administrative duties.
   62.10. Contractor (External) User. This user must only be assigned to the dial-up or remote
   ports that are dedicated for remote contractor access. Contractors usually require a broad
   range of access but are physically controlled and monitored by on-site maintenance
   personnel.
63. Security Banner.
   63.1. A security banner will appear immediately upon logging into the voice information
   system. No one is allowed further access into the system until the security banner has been
   read and acknowledged, if technically feasible. NOTE: The security banner content must
   follow the format in AFI 33-219.
   63.2. As long as a banner appears (even if not acknowledgeable), any access to the system
   via any terminal (remote or otherwise) implies consent to monitoring.
64. Remote Switch Access (RSA) Procedures for Switching Systems and Peripherals.
40                                                  AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


  64.1. Ensure positive identification of caller is made (call back verification, token exchange,
  etc.) before allowing remote access into switching systems and related assets.
  64.2. Use remote user passwords one time only. Create and issue new passwords for remote
  users on a per-call basis. Remove the password from the voice information system after use.
  Subsequent logons will require a new password for each session.
     64.2.1. When technically possible, lockout any RSA port that has been unsuccessfully
     accessed a maximum of three consecutive times.
  64.3. Remote login via modem is discouraged for routine maintenance procedures. Also, do
  not use remote login for planned maintenance functions. Remote login must always make
  use of automatic dial-back capabilities, if technically possible. This provides an extra
  measure of security that is not available with standard dial-up modem ports. Unless
  requirement to support remote maintenance support, never configure the voice information
  system to allow access without dial-back unless maintenance personnel are on-site to
  authenticate the caller and maintenance requirement. If allowed, access procedures and
  control measures must be documented in writing and approved by the CSO, base ISSO, and
  MAJCOM. This helps to prevent someone from abusing the maintenance modems.
  64.4. Do not allow maintenance contractors not assigned to the duty section access to the
  voice information system unless specifically requested by on-site personnel or there is
  specific need for data collection outlined in an agreement between the contractor and the
  government. There must be authorized maintenance personnel on-site for the duration of the
  access. Assign dedicated modems/ ports for contractor access. Turn off or physically
  disconnect dedicated contractor modems when not in use. The contractor must provide a list
  of authorized personnel who require access to the voice information system in the
  performance of their job. On-site government representatives will use this list to authenticate
  contract personnel. The contractor must periodically validate/update this list, but not later
  than every 6 months to ensure names are current and access is still required.
  64.5. Keep modems, telephones, or other ancillary equipment disconnected or off-line from
  the RSA port leaving the central office, except during RSA.
  64.6. Maintain a list of personnel that require RSA (government and contractor personnel).
  64.7. When RSA is required, it can only be requested by personnel on the RSA access list.
  Establish the connection from a designated telephone.
  64.8. Maintain a log of all requests for RSA.
  64.9. Central office personnel are responsible for ensuring the security of the RSA. Their
  duties consist of performing the following minimum sequence each time the voice
  information system is accessed via RSA.
     64.9.1. Verify that there is an immediate need for RSA.
     64.9.2. When a request for RSA is received, log the request and verify personnel against
     the RSA access list.
     64.9.3. Unless you called for maintenance support, authenticate and call back to verify

      64.9.4. Once authenticated, establish the necessary connections between the remote
      access user, the ancillary equipment (modem and port), and the trunk and/or line.
      64.9.5. Verify the RSA connection between the user and voice information system.
      64.9.6. If possible, monitor activities of the remote user in real-time. Accomplish this by
      recording remote activity with hard copy printout or other comparable means. Terminate
      the session immediately if any improper activity is observed.
   64.10. Refer to AFI 33-115V1, Network Operations, for remote management roles and
   responsibilities for IP based voice systems.
65. Review of Audit Logs and Reports.
   65.1. Switch technicians will review the security audit reports and logs daily. If
   discrepancies are noted, appropriate actions and reporting must be done in accordance with
   governing guidance.
   65.2. If technically feasible, record the following security events as a minimum, in the audit
   files:
      65.2.1. Login attempts (failed or otherwise).
      65.2.2. Remote login attempts (failed or otherwise).
      65.2.3. Password changes.
      65.2.4. Creation of user accounts.
      65.2.5. Critical table modifications (e.g., audit mechanisms deactivations and alarm table
      changes).
   65.3. If technically feasible, the audit will, as a minimum, record the user identification
   involved, time and date of the event, the event, and the success or failure of the event.
   65.4. Do not modify security audit reports unless a backup was created. Since some systems
   delete audit reports when file sizes are changed, make backup audit logs prior to any change
   in files sizes.
66. Voice Messaging/Mail System (VMS) Security.
   66.1. Protect all individual voice mailboxes with a personal identification number (PIN) (4-
   digit minimum).
   66.2. Change default PIN numbers, if appropriate, when user changes.
   66.3. Do not use obvious or trivial PIN numbers (e.g., the phone extension, social security
   number, easily guessed numeric combinations such as ―1234‖ or ―6543‖).
   66.4. Never program PIN numbers into auto dial buttons located on phones.
   66.5. Never have a greeting or announcement that states you will accept third party/collect
   calls.
   66.6. If users notice any strange messages on their voice mail box or if a greeting has been
   changed for unknown reasons, contact the Wing IA office and NOSC VPS administrator to
   assess impact of potential toll fraud.
 42                                                  AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


   66.7. Do not create voice mailboxes before they are needed. Deactivate unassigned voice
   mailboxes.
   66.8. If capable, lock out consecutive unsuccessful attempts to enter a voice mailbox.
   66.9. Do not allow ―thru-dial‖ or external transfers to any outside line or trunk (this includes
   local commercial and toll free numbers). If capable, ensure the VMS restricts ―thru-dial‖ or
   local dialing to a fixed length (e.g., limit VMS to 7-digit intra-base, Class-C, dialing).

Section H— Telephone Directories

67. Publishing Directories. Each Air Force installation will publish a telephone directory
except as follows. Where telephone exchanges serve several installations, the main installation
publishes the directory and includes listings for the satellite installations. The Defense
Metropolitan Area Telephone System (DMATS) directory is the only directory authorized for
DOD components on installations served by DMATS. Deployed forces’ locations (e.g.,
contingency or bare bases) are exempt from this requirement.
   67.1. You may publish telephone directories separately or include them as subsections of
   local installation guides (published by public affairs offices). Combination installation guide
   and telephone directories may contain commercial advertising separate from the telephone
   directory section. Units may publish commercial advertising along with the telephone
   directory; however, the telephone directory subsection cannot contain any advertising and
   vice versa.
   67.2. The area of responsibility commander provides instructions on how to prepare
   telephone directories under joint service conditions.
   67.3. Publish telephone directories annually. The wing commander may decide to publish
   more or less frequently based on the percentage of telephone numbers that change.
   67.4. You may use electronic or Web technology for telephone directories as long as they
   meet the same criteria required for hard-copy telephone directories. Additionally, consult
   with your wing information assurance office for security measures.
68. Listing Organizations in Non-Government Directories. Activities located off Air Force
installations, such as United States Air Force reserve and recruiting offices, should list their
organizations in appropriate commercial telephone company directories.
69. Releasing Telephone Directory Information. The following guidelines control the public
release of telephone directory information:
   69.1. Telephone operators should refer requests for personnel duty telephone numbers to the
   installation locator service (AFI 33-329, Base and Unit Personnel Locators).
   69.2. You may release organizational telephone numbers for use in commercial directories.
   List Air Force agencies under ―United States Air Force‖ or ―US Government.‖
   69.3. Ensure the Caller ID ―name‖ field for all outbound trunks and calls leaving the
   installation are labeled as ―US Air Force,‖ ―US Government,‖ the installation name, or
   organization/office. The use of names and ranks are not authorized for use in the Caller ID
   ―name‖ field for outbound trunks or on base calls. If needed, ensure the local
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                               43


   telecommunications carrier servicing the installation changes the applicable service control
   point database to reflect the proper name field.
   69.4. The use of automatic number identification (ANI) is not prohibited by Air Force
   policy. If ANI is used, the Wing Commander or designated representative (normally CSO)
   determines base procedures for ANI. If ANI is not used, the base operator number is
   displayed as the default.
   69.5. Maps used in all base telephone directories will not contain building numbers or home
   addresses of those individuals living in military housing, with or without their names. This
   information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act in accordance
   with DODD 5400.7-R/AFSUP, DOD Freedom of Information Act Program.
70. Releasing Installation Telephone Directories to the Public.
   70.1. You may release unclassified installation telephone directories to the public, at no
   charge, unless the directories contain listings of names which are exempt under the Freedom
   of Information Act. Mark telephone directories containing names FOR OFFICIAL USE
   ONLY (FOUO) in accordance with DOD 5400.7R/AFSUP.
   70.2. Contractors operating under a government contract may request installation telephone
   directories from the government procuring or administrative contracting officer.
71. Responsibilities for Publishing Telephone Directories.
   71.1. Base CSO:
       71.1.1. Updates directories.
       71.1.2. Distributes directories to all organizations affiliated with the installation.
   71.2. Chief, Information Flight. Arranges to print and bind directories except when the wing
   commander elects to have a commercial agency develop a combination installation guide and
   telephone directory.
   71.3. Public Affairs Officer. When including the directory in the installation guide, the
   public affairs officer:
       71.3.1. Prints enough copies to meet directory requirements.
       71.3.2. Makes sure the telephone directory subsection contains no advertising and meets
       the minimum format standards specified in Attachment 6.
   71.4. The TCOs submit telephone directory additions, changes, or deletions for their
   organizations to the base CSO. Government issued cell phones will not have their number
   listed in the National Cell Phone Call Register.
   71.5. Subscribers with Class B Service. See Attachment 6 for further guidance.
72. General Format Standards. Minimum requirements for telephone directory format
provide some standardization from installation to installation. Installations may use any
automated system to compile and produce their telephone directories. Attachment 6 contains
format standards.
73. Information Collections, Records, and Forms and Information Management Tools
(IMT).

Terms
911 Service—Emergency service for subscribers. A central control desk takes the call and
notifies appropriate local government agencies. Usually a state or local government agency
provides this service with charges collected from telephone subscribers. In many cases, the state
or local government levies this charge as a tax and the telephone company serves as the billing
agent.
Central Office Trunks—Trunks from the base voice information system to the local telephone
company’s central office. Trunks connect telephones on base to those in the commercial
exchange.
Certification—The process by which a communications and information system is evaluated for
satisfaction of requirements for interoperability, compatibility, and integration. Verified
confirmation of telephone service charges.
Classes of Telephone Service—DOD has established criteria for classifying telephone service
within military departments. Classify Air Force telephones served by either government-owned
or commercial voice systems as official (Classes A, C, and D) or unofficial (Class B). The class
of service code is a two-or more character alphanumeric code. The first character indicates
whether the line is for official or unofficial use. The second character indicates the billing mode.
The third character indicates subcategories of service.
Communications Common Carrier—Companies that the                        Federal   Communications
Commission authorizes to provide telecommunications services.
Communications and Information Systems Officer (CSO)—The officer responsible for
communications and information systems and functions at any Air Force organizational level. At
base level, the ―base CSO‖ is the commander of the communications unit responsible for
carrying out base systems duties, including management of the base-wide command, control,
communications, and computers (C4) infrastructure. At MAJCOM level, the ―MAJCOM CSO‖
is designated by the MAJCOM commander and is responsible for overall management of
MAJCOMs communications and Information assets. For detailed functions and responsibilities
refer to AFI 33-101, Commanders Guidance and Responsibilities.
Communications Service Authorization (CSA) (DD Form 428)—A contractual vehicle to
obtain telecommunications services regulated by a public utilities commission when issued
against a basic agreement. These telecommunications services are typically provided only to the
local exchange carrier. Examples are central office trunks, full business lines, and FX services.
Defense Information System Network (DISN)—An enhanced long-haul telecommunications
infrastructure that supports a full range of communications services—voice, video, and data—to
the warfighter and to organizations which support the warfighter.
Defense Metropolitan Area Telephone System (DMATS)—DMATS consolidates DOD
telephone services and facilities in a specific metropolitan area under one manager. This includes
all equipment and facilities that access local commercial exchanges, commercial long distance
service, DSN, and FTS. DMATS service excludes special-purpose voice systems and emergency
 52                                                    AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


actions' communications. DMATS locations are Boston MA, St. Louis MO, and Dayton OH.
The Air Force directs the Dayton OH DMATS.
Defense Switched Network (DSN)—1. A telecommunications system that provides switched,
end-to-end, common-user, and dedicated telephone service for the DOD. The DSN provides
rapid and low-cost long-haul, voice, data, and secure voice telecommunications for C4 users. 2.
A component of the Defense Information System Network that handles DOD switched voice,
data, and video communications. Also called ―DSN.‖ See also ―Defense Information System
Network.‖
Defense Switched Network (DSN) On- or Off-Net Calling—Official telephone calls over the
DSN system that extend calls to and from local commercial telephone numbers.
Enhanced 911 (E911) Service—Emergency service providing both ANI and Automatic
Location Identification information to emergency response centers.
Federal Telecommunications System (FTS)—The GSA manages and operates this general-
purpose, nationwide, nonsecure voice communications network. It supports the essential needs of
Federal departments and agencies. FTS gives subscribers local, long-line (intercity), and
commercial interface service.
Foreign Exchange (FX) Service—Direct commercial telephone service from an exchange
district other than the local area exchange district. The Air Force may authorize such service
when demand for another exchange is heavy. This service can produce substantial savings.
Group Billing Numbers—Some telephone companies offer special billing plans under which
customers receive a group of numbers only, or letters and numbers. The base CSO assigns these
to installation organizations (instead of a base telephone number) to allow you to identify the
origin of long distance toll calls. Telephone calling cards for various activities on an installation
provide a similar service that lets you divide the monthly toll call billing statement among base
activities. The telephone company bill gives each customer a separate summary per billing
number.
Inter-Area Dialing Behind the Private Branch Exchange (PBX)—Lets you direct-dial an
inter area DSN number from a telephone connected to a base PBX.
International Direct Distance Dialing (ID3)—A GSA-contracted service that provides
authorization for Air Force and Air Force-gained units to place long distance international calls
to and from outside the CONUS locations. Covers all other long distance calls that are not within
the scope of the FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement) contract.
Information Operations Condition (INFOCON)—A comprehensive defense posture and
response based on the status of the information systems, military operations, and intelligence
assessments of adversary capabilities and intent.
Key System—A local telecommunications system normally installed in end-user buildings
which have telephones with multiple buttons permitting (requiring) the user to directly select
central office telephone and intercom lines.
Pre-wiring—Procuring and installing communications and information wiring as an integral part
of major facility construction and alteration projects. The current engineering and construction
technical letters on pre-wiring and communication and information requirements provide
specifics.

Private Branch Exchange (PBX)—A subscriber-owned telecommunications exchange that
usually includes access to the public switched network.
RED Switch—A voice telephone switching system designed and installed to allow for
processing RED (unencrypted) secure conversations. The system has adequate isolation between
channels to prevent crosstalk. The distribution system provides adequate shielding ensuring
radiation of RED data does not occur. The design allows no multiple-party access without the
knowledge of the principal users. Subscribers are placed in and out of service when station
equipment is not under the scrutiny of properly cleared persons. RED switch interfaces provide
encryption and allow subscribers access to other secure networks.
Section 508—Enforcement of PL 105-220, Workforce Investment Act of 1998, Section 508,
Electronic and Information Technology (enacted on August 7, 1998, codified as: Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998) begins June 21, 2001 and requires Federal
agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with
disabilities. Voice systems managers will need to be aware of the mandatory requirements this
law contains.
Tariff—Rates or charges for a business or public utility by commercial telephone companies and
filed with a public regulatory agency.
Telephone Control Officer (TCO)—Individual who authorizes and controls long distance
telephone toll calls within a unit.
Toll Call—A call to any location outside the local service area; a long distance call.
Unofficial Commercial Telephone Service—Telephone service that directly connects private
telephones to a commercial telephone exchange. Not required for conduct of official business.
This includes telephone service in military housing, non-appropriated fund facilities, commercial
activities, and other facilities.
Voice System—hardware or software designed to send and receive voice signals across a
network that provides customer voice services. Voice systems include circuit-switched and
packet-switched systems.

                                          Attachment 3
 CONDITIONS FOR OFFICIAL TELEPHONE SERVICE IN PERSONAL QUARTERS

A3.1. Commanders and limited key members of their staff whose positions require immediate
communications access in support of the exercise of Command and Control may be provided
official communications services in their personal quarters. This access will be strictly limited to
individuals in command positions, and those in staff positions, whose informed advice is critical
to supporting the commander. A written justification will be supplied to the CSO for each
qualifying individual. Justifications based on an individual’s rank or claim of convenience will
not be sufficient. Each request should be accompanied by a business case which clearly
demonstrates the calamitous security consequences which could result from failure to provide the
occupant with such communications support. If the request is approved, this documentation will
be maintained by the base CSO until such time as the occupant changes position or vacates the
quarters.
A3.2. Communications Support:
   A3.2.1. All communications support provided in accordance with paragraph A3.1 are to be
   used only for official purposes (see paragraph 16 of this instruction). The support can
   include, but is not limited to: direct lines with access to both the base telephone switch and
   commercial connectivity (Class A), DSN, data (NIPRNet/SIPRNet) and STU/STE.
   Occupants who qualify for this funded communications support to their quarters are
   responsible for providing separate telephone service, at their own expense, for personal use
   (see paragraph A3.3.2 below).
   A3.2.2. Personnel not covered by Paragraph A3.1 are not authorized Class A telephone
   service that provides local off-base or commercial long distance telephone service. If
   justified, these personnel may receive official service with either direct lines to the base
   telephone switchboard or Class C Lines, and DSN access if mission essential.
A3.3. You may use multi-line instruments to terminate official and unofficial lines in approved
quarters.
   A3.3.1. The serving communications unit provides this service.
   A3.3.2. The occupant of the quarters bears any cost for the multi-line instrument that
   exceeds the cost of providing approved official service.
   A3.3.3. Use a government-owned instrument when it provides the lowest cost to the
   government.
   A3.3.4. In calculating lowest cost, consider the costs of reworking cable, removing and
   replacing instruments, purchasing instruments, etc., for current and future occupants.
A3.4. DELETED.
 58                                                   AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


                                          Attachment 4
      SPECIAL TELEPHONE FEATURES AND SERVICES FOR SPECIFIC BASE
                             ACTIVITIES

A4.1. Telephone Service in Government Transient Facilities. In providing service to
transient facilities, apply the following guidelines:
   A4.1.1. Host MAJCOMs set controls to ensure that the Air Force does not pay for unofficial
   or personal toll calls with appropriated funds; establish controls through system hardware and
   software configurations, if possible, and set up direct toll billing procedures for transient
   residents.
   A4.1.2. The MAJCOM may authorize direct access from transient billets to DSN and the
   local calling area. Do not use appropriated funds to pay message unit charges accrued for
   unofficial or personal individual calls to the local area.
   A4.1.3. When providing telephone service to transient personnel, undertake the
   responsibilities detailed in PL 101-435, Telephone Operator Consumer Service Improvement
   Act of 1990 (codified in Title 47 U.S.C., Section 226, Telegraphs, Telephones, and
   Radiotelegraphs; Wire Or Radio Communication; Common Carriers; Common Carrier
   Regulation; Telephone operator services).
   A4.1.4. Provide dial-up modem access for distinguished visitor (DV) quarters and DV
   lounges. Consider providing dial-up modem access for non-DV quarters and non-DV
   lounges.
   A4.1.5. Ensure telephone jacks are installed to allow access to all employees or telephones
   with built-in data jack ports.
A4.2. Telephone Service for Medical and Hospital Facilities. Air Force medical treatment
facilities (e.g., hospitals, clinics, aid stations, physiological training units) reimburse the host
base for commercial communications services furnished by or through the base (see AFI 65-601,
Volume 1). The host base funds services such as the base fire-crash network and other alarm
circuits.
A4.3. Official Telephone Service for Hospitalized Active Duty Military Personnel. A
hospital room is the duty location for hospitalized personnel. Provide Class C telephone service
unless the base CSO approves a higher class of service or special features.
A4.4. Private Telephone Service for Hospital Patients. The hospital administrator
coordinates with the base CSO to give private unofficial telephone service to hospital patients
who request it. A contractual agreement for commercial service is solely between the patient and
the commercial company providing the service. When the government provides Class B service,
the patient must pay the recurring cost plus the cost of individual toll calls.
A4.5. Telephone Service for Contractors. The Air Force may provide official telephone
service for contractors. Stipulate provisions for this service in the contract. Regardless of base
telephone ownership, the following provisions apply:
   A4.5.1. Contractors normally use commercial service when available and practical.
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                                 59


   A4.5.2. The Air Force charges the contractor public tariff rates for supplemental services.
   These services include facilities such as key equipment, special switchboards, private lines,
   and FX lines for the exclusive use of the contractor. In the absence of tariff rates, or if tariff
   rates are excessive, the wing commander determines equitable charges based on the actual
   cost of providing the services.
   A4.5.3. The Air Force furnishes long distance service from Class B-2 telephones to
   contractors, on a reimbursable basis, for the actual charge, plus tax, except:
       A4.5.3.1. When the Air Force provides telephone services, contractors pay Federal tax
       except on toll and telegraph charges.
       A4.5.3.2. When contractors arrange for their own telephone service, they pay Federal
       tax.
       A4.5.3.3. When the contractor charges for official military use of telephone facilities, the
       base CSO arranges for voice systems’ tax exemption certificates to relieve the contractor
       of tax liability for these charges. The contractor initiates these certificates and submits
       them to the local telephone company.
   A4.5.4. Air Force activities do not give government telephone calling cards to contractors.
   A4.5.5. The procedures for authorizing, controlling, and recording long distance service also
   apply to official collect telephone calls that contractor personnel place or receive.
   A4.5.6. The agency funding the contract reimburses the host base for telephone charges that
   the contractor incurs.
   A4.5.7. CJCSI 6215.01B provides guidance on when United States civilian contractor
   personnel can use the DSN.
A4.6. Telephone Service for Nonprofit Organizations. Nonprofit organizations do not pay
charges for services on an Air Force installation when performing a function related to, or
furthering a Federal Government objective or one that is in the interest of public health and
welfare.
A4.7. Telephone Service for Government Employee Labor Unions. CJCSI 6215.01B
provides guidance on the condition for providing DSN access to labor unions. Access to DSN is
not normally provided to labor unions and is not routinely authorized in contract documents.
The basis for supporting a request must be a clearly operational, military-related function.
AFCA cannot grant DSN access; a waiver granting access must come from DISA. The wing
commander determines which labor unions meet the definition. Labor unions that do not fit this
definition pay Class B-2 rates for telephone service, reimbursable long distance telephone
service.
A4.8. Telephone Service for Public Schools. Public schools normally use commercial
telephone service on Air Force installations. The school reimburses the government for the cost
of Class B services.
A4.9. Telephone Service for Government-Operated Schools. Provide Class A-2 and Class C-
2 telephone service to government-operated school facilities for military dependents on an Air
Force installation.
 60                                                    AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


A4.10. Telephone Service for the American Red Cross. Provide official telephone service
(Class A or Class C) without reimbursement if ARC personnel supplement MWRS functions
covered by the Air Force 34-series instructions. The ARC must use separate, unofficial
telephone service to conduct unofficial business.
A4.11. Telephone Service for Civilian Post Offices on Military Installations. Provide
reimbursable telephone service to on-base civilian post offices, branches, or stations.
A4.12. Telephone Service for Commissaries. Provide official telephone service to
commissaries. Accumulate costs for these services and report to the base-level FSO each
quarter. Provide the following telephone services to commissaries:
   A4.12.1. Official Service for CONUS and Hawaii Commissaries. Provide official service in
   retail sales stores, including key equipment, using appropriated funds. Reimbursement of
   charges for telephone service from surcharge funds will conform to DOD cash management
   and debt collection policies. The host MAJCOM provides one Class A telephone in the
   administrative office to handle troop issues and serve command management (above retail
   sales store level). The wing commander determines how to apportion telephone service
   charges when the resale and command management or troop issue functions share service.
   A4.12.2. Official Service for Alaska and Overseas Commissaries. The host MAJCOM
   provides official telephone service without charge for these areas.
A4.13. Telephone Service for Military Clothing Sales Stores. In order to conduct official
business related to military clothing sales, provide official telephone service, at no charge, to the
retail agent authorized to stock, sell, and issue military clothing.
A4.14. Telephone Service for Morale, Welfare, Recreation, and Services (MWRS)
Activities. Follow the policy and authority for communications support to MWRS activities in
AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities.
   A4.14.1. Provide reimbursable communications services when the Air Force does not
   authorize using appropriated funds.
A4.15. Telephone Service for Civil Air Patrol (CAP). Unless otherwise noted in host base-
tenant support agreements and authorized by the base financial officer, provide CAP
organizations single-line, Class-C services according to AFPD 10-27 and AFI 10-2701,
Organization and Function of the Civil Air Patrol.
A4.16. Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS). This service is
provided by the Office of the Manager, National Communications System that supports federal,
state, local government, industry, and non-profit organization personnel in performing their
National Security and Emergency Preparedness missions. GETS provides emergency access and
priority processing in the local and long distance segments of the Public Switched Telephone
Network. It is intended to be used in an emergency or crisis situation during which the
probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means has
significantly decreased. GETS will not preempt public traffic, nor are there levels of precedence
in GETS. A GETS card contains the universal access number and a PIN.
   A4.16.1. It is highly encouraged that each base incorporate GETS into their wing/base
   command post, disaster support group, and other mission critical operation centers. As a
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                          61


  minimum, Wing/CC, Wing Command Center, Commanders of the Ops and Maintenance
  Groups, and the local Communications Squadron Commanders should have access to a
  GETS card.
  A4.16.2. Wing/base POCs are responsible for submitting GETS requirements through their
  MAJCOM functions for GETS access and PIN. It is the responsibility of the local base
  GETS POC (appointed by local Communications Squadron Commanders) to educate users
  on GETS procedures.
  A4.16.3. GETS is accessed through a universal access number 1-710-NCS-GETS (1-710-
  627-4387) using common telephone equipment such as a standard desk set, STU-III,
  facsimile, modem, or wireless phone. A prompt will direct the entry of your PIN and the
  telephone number. Once you have been authenticated as a valid user, your call is identified
  as National Security and/or Emergency Preparedness type call and receives special treatment.
  A4.16.4. For more in-depth information and ordering procedures see the GETS Web site at
  http:// gets.ncs.gov.

                     CHARGES FOR BASE TELEPHONE SERVICES

A5.1. Base Responsibilities. Communications Squadrons are responsible for providing a basic
telephone instrument to base users (depending on user, i.e., special C2, C2, or common); services
that have special instrument requirements may be the user’s responsibility, if deemed outside the
scope of a basic telephone instrument.
A5.2. Class A Service. See Attachment 1 for definition. Monthly charges for Class A
telephone service provided from government-owned or commercially-leased voice information
system are:
   A5.2.1. Class A-1. Provide Class A-1 service without cost to Air Force activity users.
   Accumulate monthly toll and other specialized communications charges to Air Force tenant
   units not directly supporting the host base mission and send them to the local FSO for
   reimbursement by the tenant unit to the host base (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1).
   A5.2.2. Class A-2.
       A5.2.2.1. DOD tenants directly supporting the host base mission receive Class A-2
       service without cost.
       A5.2.2.2. DOD tenants not directly supporting the host base mission (including ARC)
       receive basic Class A-2 service without cost. Accumulate monthly toll and other
       specialized communications charges and send them to the local FSO for reimbursement
       by the tenant unit to the host base (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1).
       A5.2.2.3. MWRS activities that do not receive communications support according to
       paragraph A4.14, reimburse the Air Force for the service. Use the same rates as the
       commercial carrier serving the installation. Station lines cost at least $14 per month and
       each station termination in the community costs at least $3.50. Compute all other
       charges, such as installation, miscellaneous, and special equipment charges, using the
       same procedures as for Class B telephone service.
   A5.2.3. Class A-3. The rates for Class A-3 service are the same as those paid by the
   installation to the commercial carrier. Station lines cost at least $14 per month and each
   station termination in the community costs at least $3.50, plus all other charges (tolls,
   installation, relocation, and specialized equipment charges based on local telephone company
   tariffs for United States bases [including Hawaii and Alaska]). Installation and relocation
   charges for overseas bases are the same as Class B. The user pays additional costs for
   facilities such as trunks, tie lines, toll terminals, and incidental operation or maintenance
   personnel.
   A5.2.4. Class A-4. Provide telephone service for the Defense Commissary Agency retail
   sales stores according to paragraph A4.12 Charges for reimbursable service are the same as
   for Class A-2 service.
A5.3. 911 or Enhanced 911 Service. See Attachment 1 for definitions.
   A5.3.1. The United States and its instrumentalities are constitutionally exempt from direct
   taxation by state and local governments. Oftentimes, service charges billed for emergency
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                               63


   services (i.e., 911 calls) are actually direct taxes that the Air Force is not authorized to pay
   (billed as a surcharge by the telephone company and remitted to the taxing authority). What
   the charge is labeled is not a sufficient indicator of whether it is a tax or proper service
   charge. Generally, emergency notification service charges are:
       A5.3.1.1. Proper and payable if imposed by a telephone company for its own services
       and duly permitted by the tariff.
       A5.3.1.2. Improper when the state or local government actually imposes the charge and
       merely uses the telephone company as a collection agent. In such cases, notify the
       telephone company that the United States Government is constitutionally exempt from
       the 911 service fee and cannot legally pay the fee.
   A5.3.2. If it is unclear whether the charge is a fee or a tax, contact the staff judge advocate,
   base legal office, MAJCOM, or comptroller for guidance.
   A5.3.3. This guidance does not apply to fees for private telephone service for on-base
   residents. If base housing is in an area where the base provides fire, police, and other
   emergency services, residents may challenge the emergency notification service charge.
   However, because telephone service to on-base residents is a private contract between the
   subscriber and the telephone company, on-base residents cannot claim exemption from the
   charge on the basis of sovereign immunity.
A5.4. Class B Service. See Attachment 1 for definition. DOD Comptroller establishes rates
for Class B telephone services covered in this instruction on an annual basis. These charges
apply when government-owned or commercial voice systems provide Class B service.
   A5.4.1. Class B Installation, Activation, and Relocation Charges. The installation,
   activation, and relocation charges for Class B stations apply regardless of whether previous
   wiring or other telephone connecting devices are available. Installation, activation, and
   relocation charges for external miscellaneous devices (e.g., jacks, buzzers, and gongs) are the
   same as those charged by the nearest United States-owned and operated telephone company
   providing similar services.
   A5.4.2. Class B Schedule of Rates. Rates are set annually by DOD and published in Rates
   for Class B Services. Class B services are:
       A5.4.2.1. United States rates:
          A5.4.2.1.1. Flat monthly rates for various classes of unofficial telephone service
          provided by government-owned or commercial voice systems in the United States
          (including Hawaii and Alaska) are the same as those set by the local commercial
          telephone company providing city trunking to the base, post, or station.
          A5.4.2.1.2. Rates are not less than those listed for unofficial service by government-
          owned facilities in overseas locations.
          A5.4.2.1.3. Rates exclude mileage or special facility construction charges that the
          local commercial telephone company charges to the public.
          A5.4.2.1.4. Use the rate of the company providing city trunking to the base, post, or
          station when more than one commercial telephone company operates in the vicinity.
64                                                AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


         A5.4.2.1.5. Rates apply to the types of services provided (such as private lines,
         multiparty lines, and extension telephones).
         A5.4.2.1.6. Installation, activation, and relocation charges for all types of
         government-provided Class B main and extension stations in the United States
         (including Hawaii and Alaska) are at the same rates as those paid by the base to the
         commercial telephone company. They are not less than the charges based on the flat
         monthly rate.
         A5.4.2.1.7. Charges for installing or activating main stations and extensions are not
         less than the charges for one month of the same type of service and not less than 40
         percent of the main station installation or activation charge for extension stations.
         A5.4.2.1.8. Relocation or activation charges for main or extension stations are not
         less than the amount computed for installing or activating extension stations.
     A5.4.2.2. Overseas rates for Class B stations:
         A5.4.2.2.1. Government-owned telephone facilities.         Installation or activation
         charges for Class B lines provided by government-owned telephone facilities are the
         same as the flat monthly rate for that type of Class B service. Installation or
         activation charges for each additional station line termination are 40 percent of the
         flat monthly rate for that type of Class B service. Relocation charges for each
         extension line termination are the same as installation or activation charges for
         additional wiring and telephone jacks.
         A5.4.2.2.2. Leased telephone facilities. Installation, activation, and relocation
         charges for all types of Class B main and extension stations are at the same rates as
         those paid by the base for the service.
  A5.4.3. FY-2000 flat monthly rates for various classes of unofficial telephone service
  provided by government-owned telephone facilities in overseas locations, unless otherwise
  modified by status-of-forces agreements are:
     A5.4.3.1. Class B-1: $23.30.
     A5.4.3.2. Class B-2: $41.25.
     A5.4.3.3. Class B party-line service. Applicants who want party-line service may choose
     two- or four-party service, if available. When more than one Class B party receives
     service over the same base telephone line, flat monthly charges for party-line service are
     the same charges paid by the installation to the commercial company but not less than
     these schedules:
         A5.4.3.3.1. Two-party service. The minimum flat monthly charges for two-party line
         base telephone-service are:
            A5.4.3.3.1.1. Class B-1a: $17.25.
            A5.4.3.3.1.2. Class B-2a: $30.50.
         A5.4.3.3.2. Three-party service. No provision is made for three-party service in the
         DOD-authorized standard services and rates for Class B subscribers.
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                             65


         A5.4.3.3.3. Four-party service. Applicants selecting four-party service pay the
         monthly rate shown, regardless of the ―line fill.‖ The line fill may fluctuate from one
         to four parties on the line as other subscribers are disconnected from, or added to, the
         line. The maximum flat monthly charges that apply to four-party line base telephone
         service are:
             A5.4.3.3.3.1. Class B-1b: $11.50.
             A5.4.3.3.3.2. Class B-2b: $20.35.
  A5.4.4. Restricted Service. When Class B individual, two-party, or four-party services are
  restricted to on-base connections without access to the telephone company central office or
  long distance service, 75 percent of the applicable flat monthly charges for Class B service
  applies.
  A5.4.5. Class B Supplemental Service and Equipment. The user pays the costs for facilities
  and services beyond those covered by the standard rates, including:
     A5.4.5.1. Miscellaneous equipment and special features. Charges for miscellaneous
     equipment such as single line telephone instruments, external ringers, flashing lamps, and
     other station accessories are the same as those charged for similar services by the nearest
     United States-owned and -operated telephone company. Charges for special features and
     services provided from the base telephone switch such as three-way calling, call waiting,
     call forwarding, and other features are the same as those from the nearest United States-
     owned and -operated telephone company. This charge applies to all classes of unofficial
     service.
  A5.4.6. Long Distance Calls. The subscriber of the Class B station originating the call pays
  the cost of unofficial long distance calls. The cost is consistent with telephone company
  charges. Do not use the FTS-2001 (or its designated replacement) for unofficial calls, even
  on a reimbursable basis. The CSO must make sure subscribers can place commercial long
  distance calls at the bases where Class B service is provided.
  A5.4.7. Mileage. The user pays the monthly charges for line mileage to reach off-premise
  Class B telephones.
  A5.4.8. Class B Taxes. Compute Federal taxes when they apply to Class B service
  according to the rates in the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C., Section 4293 Internal
  Revenue Code; Miscellaneous Excise Taxes; Facilities And Services; Special Provisions
  Applicable to Services and Facilities Taxes; Exemption for United States and possessions).
  Apply Federal taxes on billing for local and long distance service contractors, commissioned
  officers’ and NCO open messes, and similar activities. Personal long distance service from
  tax-exempt agencies is taxable. Do not collect Federal taxes on billing to the ARC and
  Federal credit unions, which were granted an exemption under 26 U.S.C., Section 4293.
  Collect Federal taxes from service clubs and base exchange activities. Installation and
  relocation charges are not subject to Federal taxes.
  A5.4.9. Class B Charges. Charges to Class B users are subject to the following policies:
     A5.4.9.1. Charging for service and equipment. Bill service and equipment charges
     (including taxes when applicable) to Class B subscribers in the first monthly bill after the
 66                                                  AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


      charges are incurred, except when the wing commander requires advance payment.
      Prorate advance payments when service begins after the start of the billing period.
      A5.4.9.2. Billing long distance calls. Bill long distance service charges to Class B
      subscribers with the first regular monthly bill after receiving the commercial telephone
      company bill for the service. Long distance telephone charges do not require advance
      deposits.
      A5.4.9.3. Billing local calls. The standard rates for Class B service apply regardless of
      whether the telephone company furnishes local service at a flat or measured rate. The
      standard rates entitle the Class B subscriber to make local calls without additional charge.
      EXCEPTIONS: When message unit charges apply and when ANI equipment can identify
      the individual subscriber station making the call, bill message unit charges to the user.
      A5.4.9.4. Prorating charges. When a subscriber receives service for only a part of the
      monthly billing period, or when a service outage exceeds 24 hours, prorate the charge.
      Prorate bills according to the approved tariff or prorating procedures of the local
      telephone company. The subscriber service outage period begins when the subscriber
      reports the outage and ends when the telephone company restores service.
      A5.4.9.5. Recurring charges. Bill charges for supplemental services and equipment to
      the user at local telephone company rates. Bill supplemental service and equipment
      charges for a part of the billing period to the subscriber at the full monthly rate and do not
      prorate.
      A5.4.9.6. Collecting. The FSO collects charges from users of Class B telephone service.
      Wing commanders may institute a payroll-deduction plan to pay for Class B telephone
      service.
      A5.4.9.7. Depositing money received for services. Account for money received for
      telephone service as public funds according to prescribed Air Force policies and
      procedures for reimbursement to appropriated funds.
A5.5. Class C Service. See Attachment 1 for definition. The conditions and arrangements for
providing Class A service from either a government-owned or a commercial voice information
system also apply to providing Class C service. Charges for Class C service are:
   A5.5.1. Class C-1. Same as Class A-1.
   A5.5.2. Class C-2. No cost to the subscriber except that toll and other specialized
   communications charges to DOD tenants not directly supporting the host base mission
   accumulate monthly and are sent to the local FSO for possible reimbursement to the Air
   Force. Defense Commissary Agency facilities and retail sales stores in CONUS must
   reimburse the government for communications support at the rate of $4 per month for each
   station line termination and $2.50 for each extension station line termination. Charges for
   installation, moves, and special and miscellaneous equipment are additional. Compute
   installation and relocation charges in the same manner as for Class B telephone installation
   and relocation.
   A5.5.3. Class C-3. Same as Class C-2 except for installation, relocation, and specialized
   equipment charges which are determined by local telephone tariffs for bases in CONUS,
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                         67


  Hawaii, and Alaska, and determined by Class B charges as shown in paragraph A5.3.2.2 for
  overseas bases.
  A5.5.4. Class C-4. Same as Class C-2 except for the troop issue function of the commissary.

              FORMAT STANDARDS FOR TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES

A6.1. Directories. Each telephone directory must contain a section for general information,
organizational listings, and alphabetical listings. The wing commander may also authorize a
personnel listing section.
   A6.1.1. General Information. This section tells readers how to use the installation voice
   information system.
       A6.1.1.1. It should explain how to:
          A6.1.1.1.1. Use the installation voice information system, including directions for
          making on-base, local-area, long distance, and overseas calls, and for using special
          telephone features such as call-forwarding, conference-calling, speed-calling, and so
          on.
          A6.1.1.1.2. Use the Secure Voice Communications Network, including STU-III and
          STE instruments, if the installation has such equipment. Describe how to schedule
          and use the installation common-user terminals. The MAJCOM may permit
          subscriber designators and numbers in this section of the directory.
          A6.1.1.1.3. Make DSN calls. Describe the telephone precedence system.
          A6.1.1.1.4. Report telephone service problems.
          A6.1.1.1.5. Report nuisance and bomb-threat calls.
          A6.1.1.1.6. Identify mission needs for new telephones and services (AFI 33-103).
          A6.1.1.1.7. Request or terminate unofficial (Class B) telephone service, when
          applicable. Include a statement that the Air Force reserves the right to enter premises
          where it provides such telephones to inspect, repair, or remove equipment.
       A6.1.1.2. Design your directory so that it shows:
          A6.1.1.2.1. Locations and DSN numbers of frequently called activities on the
          installation. Extract the numbers from the DOD Worldwide DSN Directory,
          http://www.disa.mil/gs/dsn/ dsn_directory.html.
          A6.1.1.2.2. Installations where the caller can dial numbers direct (direct in-dial
          capability) by Xs following the two-digit or three-digit DSN prefix (e.g., 868-
          XXXX).
          A6.1.1.2.3. The unit providing the telephone service, directory updates, and repair
          service.
          A6.1.1.2.4. Common-user facsimile numbers and locations.            Include verification
          numbers.
   A6.1.2. Organizational Listings. This section lists all units in alphanumeric order served by
   the telephone exchange. Put the MAJCOM and installation activities first. Show the main
   staff offices of each organization. Use official titles to identify each major function, per AFI
   38-101, Air Force Organization.
AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012                                                              69


      A6.1.2.1. You may optionally name officers with staff office entries. Include building
      address or location designators, and show the office functional address symbol after each
      major element, per AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications.
      A6.1.2.2. Print only one telephone number on each line; show an alternate number, if
      any, on a separate line. List only the first number of a rotary-sequence voice information
      system.
      A6.1.2.3. Do not list Class A numbers if the subscriber is also served by Class C service.
      For facsimile numbers serving the organization, show the building number, functional
      address, office symbol, and verification number.
   A6.1.3. Alphabetical Listings. This section contains an alphabetical listing of all activities.
   Use acceptable military titles that users can easily understand. Include building numbers and
   room numbers if needed. Each activity may have as many listings as it has common names.
   Cross-reference entries for reader convenience. For example, the reader may look for NCO
   Club under ―N‖ for ―NCO Club‖ or under ―C‖ for ―Club, NCO.‖ Avoid listing all units
   under such entries as Commander, Chief, and Executive Officer, because users can easily
   find these titles in the organizational listing section.
   A6.1.4. Personnel Listing (Optional). This section follows the classified listing. On a single
   line name, grade, duty telephone number, office symbol, and building number. Do not list
   home telephone numbers (Class B) and personal commercial telephone numbers unless
   personnel have given written consent to publish them (AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program).
A6.2. Cover Requirements.
   A6.2.1. Cover Page. The cover page must contain the following information:
      A6.2.1.1. Host MAJCOM.
      A6.2.1.2. Installations served and their locations (include state or country). Include
      organizational emblems when space permits.
      A6.2.1.3. DSN and commercial prefixes (include area code) for the installation, operator
      assistance numbers, and directory assistance number.
      A6.2.1.4. Date published.
      A6.2.1.5. Emergency telephone numbers.
      A6.2.1.6. COMSEC notice and the consent statement from DODD 4640.6 at the bottom.
   A6.2.2. Inside Front Cover. The inside front cover contains a table of contents. Make sure
   the table of contents lists the principal units served by the telephone exchange and page
   references.
   A6.2.3. Inside Back Cover. The inside back cover lists key fire alarm boxes and public pay
   telephone locations. Include telephone numbers for the public pay telephones and indicate
   which have audio amplifiers.
   A6.2.4. Outside Back Cover. The outside back cover lists frequently called telephone
   numbers for service activities (e.g., billeting, base operations, finance, barbershops, and on-
   and off-base taxi service). Show commonly used names and avoid local nicknames.
 70                                                  AFI33-111_934AWSUP_I 19 JUNE 2012


A6.3. Consider:
   A6.3.1. Including an installation map.
   A6.3.2. Using slogans to provide helpful reminders on various topics (e.g., safety, security,
   and energy conservation) important to the Air Force community.
   A6.3.3. Using illustrations with slogans. Relate them directly to the subject matter and use
   good taste.
   A6.3.4. Using an international time zone chart.
   A6.3.5. You may use colored paper for telephone directories. You may use a different color
   for each section of the directory to make it easier to use. Refrain from using the color red for
   a cover; it could be construed as a classified document. For combined installation guides and
   directories, colored paper can help users quickly locate a specific directory section.
