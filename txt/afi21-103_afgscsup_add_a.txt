SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. This revision clarifies
policy and changes/adds information to the February 2010 edition. Deleted qualifying note 4
(cockpit utility lights not required), added Inspection Management System (IMS) into verbiage.
Added Adaptable Communications Suite (ACS) WUC 63C to Table 1 and completed minor
administrative corrections.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable
(MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission in accordance with
AFGSC/CC OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy FMC
     aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A Not Mission Capable
     (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be configured and
     generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All AFGSC and ANG units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using AFGSC
     MESLs. Major Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment
     to another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and
     specify the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
     code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL)
     across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
     applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all AFGSC assigned aircraft
     and therefore it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are
     applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded
     aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to
     their DOC statement. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using
     the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code. See Table 1 B-
     2A MESL

                                     QUALIFYING NOTES:
1. Aircraft signature will be assessed using the B-2 LO Inspection Management System (IMS)
and operational assessment. Aircraft modeled IMS “Green” will be reported FMC. Aircraft
with a degraded LO system (modeled IMS “Yellow” or “Red”) will be evaluated by Signature
Diagnostics/Survivability Flight for operational condition and status will reflect results (FMC,
PMC or NMC). For LO discrepancies not modeled by IMS, applicable technical orders and/or
guidance provided by appropriate engineering authority will be followed.

2. Right APU Required

3. One Fully Operational APU Required.

4. Deleted

5. As Required by AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.

6. Three Operational MDUs per Crew Position Required for PMC

7. CIDS Display Required.

8. One Operational AIT Radio Required for PMC.

9. Either AINS or INS Must Be Operational

10. TELS antennas, receivers, radio frequency preamplifiers and preprocessors are required for
PMC.

NOTE: Aircraft modified for testing purposes will be coded PMC if the aircraft can meet
required DOC generation timing requirements. For example, installation of instrumented Crew
Entry Door/Periodic Radar Surveillance Mission DMS Door for range/test sorties, etc.
