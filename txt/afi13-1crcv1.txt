      Washington DC 20330-1480

SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum (AFGM) for AFI 13-1CRC Vol. 1

By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force this Guidance Memorandum immediately implements
changes to AFI 13-1CRC Vol. 1, Control and Reporting Center Training. Specifically, this GM
changes the Battle Staff Coordinator (BSC) from a qualification to a certification. This change
identifies the certification training program, and removes all references to the BSC as a duty
position. A separate AFGM will be published to ensure deletion of BSC evaluation criteria from
AFI 13-1 CRC Vol.2.

This guidance is intended to address converting the BSC from a qualification to a certification
for CRC crewmembers, thereby removing qualification training requirements.

This Memorandum becomes void after 1 year has elapsed from its date, or upon incorporation by
AFI 13-1CRC Volume 1. There are no releasibility restrictions on this memorandum.

qualification training and is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission. BMC crewmembers
do not maintain CMR status due to duty assignment or other reasons as determined by the
appropriate authority.

Basic Qualified (BQ)—Status of individuals who have completed a positional evaluation and
are qualified to perform basic crew duties of a specific duty position. Squadron CCs will
carefully choose those missions/events on which BQ individuals may work unsupervised,
however, BQ qualified individuals will only perform those duties for which they have been
trained and qualified. BQ is not a long-term qualification, but can be held until the individual
either completes requirements to become BMC in a specific unit’s mission or CMR
depending on specific assigned unit, staff organizational position, or as determined by the
appropriate authority.

Certification—1) Procedure used to document competency in a particular task. Not
interchangeable with “qualification” which requires Form 8 documentation. 2) A formal
indication of an individual’s ability to perform a task to required standards. 3) The formal

operators using simulation models and communications to replicated a participating platform or
agency.

Continuation Training (CT)—Academic and positional training required to maintain
CMR/BMC qualification.

Crew Training Device (CTD)—A training platform suitable to conduct training and
evaluations.

Controlled Events (SD/AWO/WD)—A controlled event will include control of any of the
following mission types: air-to-air employment, air-to-surface, combat search and rescue
(CSAR), air refueling (A/R) (must be live or DMO). The SD and MCC will consider the
quality of training when determining whether an event should qualify as a controlled mission.




6
Currency—Currency is associated with specific training requirements and is a
Commander’s tool established to ensure average crewmembers maintain a minimum level of
proficiency in a given event.

Distributed Mission Operations—A training/exercise environment that uses virtual and
constructive entities to conduct mission training from individual operator training through large
force employment (LFE) scenarios.

DTOC Constructive Workstations (CWS)—Simulation tools and communications used by
current and qualified pilots to replicate participating aircraft.

Eligibility Period—The 6-month period prior to expiration date of the evaluation during which
an individual must complete all written and positional requirements for the recurring
qualification evaluation.

Evaluation—1) The procedure to determine the effectiveness of the performance of an
instructional product or process in order to ascertain specific causes for the effectiveness or lack
of it, and to make decisions appropriate to the extent of the effectiveness. Evaluation of formal
courses includes field evaluation and internal evaluation. 2) The review and analysis of
qualitative or quantitative data obtained from design review, hardware inspection, testing or
operational use of equipment. 3) The positional and written examinations used to determine
proficiency as prescribed by governing directives.

Event Operation—A term used to describe/capture training tasks by crew position that once
accomplished may be logged/credited toward the crewmember’s continuation training cycle or
RAP training event requirements. The criteria for an event operation includes the requirement
for executing shift/daily training crew operations for a minimum of one hour.

Experienced—A category of crewmembers associated to crew position, and defined by one or
more of the following criterion: Air Force Specialty Code, type of qualification, amount of time
the individual has been qualified, numbers of weapon system hours, and/or the number, type,
currency of missions and/or events.

Extended Training Period—Training period designed for individuals who fail to progress into
the next phase of training.

Inexperienced—A category of crew members that do not meet the criterion required to
establish experienced status. (see experienced above).

Initial Qualification—1) A crewmember engaged in training needed to qualify for basic crew
duties in an assigned position for a specific weapon system, without regard for the unit’s
operational mission. 2) The first evaluation given to determine an individual’s BQ qualification
status. It will consist of a positional evaluation and a written examination.




7
Instructor—Experienced CMR/BMC qualified individual in operations positional duties
qualified/certified to instruct other individuals. (For Instructor Qualification/Certification, see
Chapter 5.)

Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—Training necessary to initially qualify individuals in a
basic crew position to perform duties without regard to the unit’s mission. Upon completion of
IQT, individuals attain Basic Qualification (BQ) status.

Mission Evaluation (MSN)—A written evaluation given after MQT to determine an
individual’s CMR status.

Mission—Department of Defense definition: The task, together with the purpose, that clearly
indicates the action to be taken and the reason therefore. In common usage, especially when
applied to lower military units, a duty assigned to an individual or unit, a task. For the
purpose of this AFI, a more detailed explanation of this term applies: A mission includes
briefing, controlling and debriefing. Briefings should include training objectives. Controlling
consists of taking radio and radar control of aircraft and accomplishing one or more types of
mission, such as air-to-air, air refueling, air-to-surface, and active air defense scrambles.
Debriefing should be with the pilots (and instructor where applicable). The brief/ debrief
may be accomplished via telephone/radio; however, face-to-face briefs provide optimum
training.

Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Specific training designed to prepare crewmembers
to perform duties/tasks in support of a unit mission or tasking. Graduates of MQT are certified
CMR/BMC by the squadron commander.

*Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR/N-BMC)—The status of a crewmember: 1) who
has completed IQT and has passed an initial evaluation but is not certified to perform specific
duties in support of the CRC or DRU mission; 2) who failed to maintain specifically defined
crew position currency requirements; 3) who failed to meet lookback; 4) who failed to complete
recurring/RAP training cycle training requirements; 5) who failed to meet AFI 13-1 Stan Eval
Vol. 2 or AFI 13-1CRC Vol. 2 requirements; or 6) who was downgrade at the direction of their
commander.

Positional Training—Hands-on training resulting from performance of duties in assigned
positions.

Proficiency—A measure of how well a task is completed. A crewmember is considered
proficient when they can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed, accuracy,
and safety.

Prorating—This is the process used to determine a crewmember’s training requirement
proportionately based on approved consideration to include TDY (including contingency
operations), medical disqualified/DNIC, or emergency leave status for more than 30 days.




8
Qualification—A status assigned to a crewmember after completion of specific positional
training and the accomplishment of an evaluation resulting in the generation of Form 8
documentation. (see certification)

Ready Aircrew Program—RAP is a MAJCOM Continuation Training specific training
program issued by memorandum to combat coded/DOC-tasked units that applies to both CMR
and BMC crewmembers. It is intended focus training toward current and relevant combat skills.
The MAJCOM RAP tasking memorandum takes precedence over the academic and
positional event requirements outlined in Chapter 4 for combat coded units.

Remedial Training—Training for individuals who fail a spot/recurring evaluation, or as
determined by the unit CC/DO. Once qualified, personnel accomplish their required training
requirements or are otherwise downgraded.

Training Period—A specific amount of time to accomplish a prescribed phase of
training.

Training Cycle—A specifically defined period associated with defining, tracking, reporting,
and documenting continuation/RAP Training requirements. Although other combat units
typically use a 20 month AEF associated training cycle, the training cycle for CRC units and
DRUs addressed in this AFI is 1 October through 30 September.

Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—For the purpose of this instruction, a UTA is considered to
be the 2-day period per month that ANG operations personnel spend on duty.

Unqualified—The status of an individual who: 1) has not completed IQT training requirements
and successfully passed an INIT evaluation or 2) has failed or accomplished a recurring
positional evaluation or 3) has failed a spot or re-examination or 4) has not been current for more

    when the appropriate training requirements have been completed.
    1.2.6.6. Designate experienced CMR/BMC personnel for training as instructors and after
    appropriate training, sign the appointment memo.
    1.2.6.7. Submit a training report through their Group, if applicable, to ACC/A3YG
    (USAFE/A3YO) every 4th month during the training cycle (Jan, May, Sep). Squadrons
    may submit out of cycle reports at anytime if Higher Headquarters (HHQ) assistance is
    required to prepare for Designed Operational Capability (DOC) or AEF tasking.
       1.2.6.7.1. Reports will consist of: 1) an email memo summarizing results or
       unresolved issues since the last report, current training plan summary, and significant
       shortfalls/limiting factors (LIMFACS) affecting training. 2) A training deficiency
       report (TDR) (attachment to email memo) summarizing critical training issues. Both
       items should be IAW the guidance and examples located on the AF Portal/COP under
       CRC                        Training                        https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
       af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=-2096771. Reports will reflect status of
       different phases of training unique to their AEF/deployment cycle with the intent to
       provide a snapshot of the unit’s training health. Report only significant shortfalls or
       LIMFACS of events or missions/events that affect 15% or greater of a crew position.
       Include possible solutions or specific assistance required. The Group and/or
       MAJCOM will attempt to rectify or minimize noted shortfalls/LIMFACS while the
       training cycle is under way.
       1.2.6.7.2. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not accomplished
       due to shortages of equipment or flying activity.
       1.2.6.7.3. LIMFACS are specific factors such as constraints, restrictions, etc. that
       degrade training effectiveness. For example, a squadron’s ability to accomplish
       training is limited due to the lack of a venue where the CRC can control aircraft
       because of range control rules or other competing command and control agencies.
    1.2.6.8. Ensure training scenarios and RAP missions are oriented to developing and
    practicing crew duties based on unit DOC statement and/or local missions to include
    crew integration and current TTPs.

     on individuals who cannot perform or meet the unit DOC/training mission requirements.
  1.2.7. Squadron COT will:
     1.2.7.1. Use Lead MAJCOM/HQ ACC/A3-approved syllabi, MAJCOM training
     courseware/training materials (for ACC this includes the COT Handbook), locally
     developed materials (if necessary), and the Learning Management System (LMS) to
     implement an effective training program.
     1.2.7.2. Ensure an individual’s training records/accomplishments are reviewed prior to
     entry into training and identify and recommend an appropriate duty position to the DO
     based on the individual’s background and experience. Ensure the course of training
     approved by Squadron DO is completed.
         1.2.7.2.1. After a records review, establish a tailored requalification program for
         individuals returning to CRC/DRU and if appropriate, requalify in the same duty
         position.

         changes to training products. The recommendation shall include the rationale with
         references and placement into the following distinct categories:
            1.2.7.6.1.1. CRITICAL. Critical comments highlight incorrect that must be
            resolved.
            1.2.7.6.1.2. MAJOR. Major comments are significant concerns within the
            training materials that may result in non-effective training. This category may be
            used with a general statement of concern with a subject area, intent of the
            document, etc., followed by detailed comments on specific entries in documents
            that, taken together, constitute the concern.
            1.2.7.6.1.3. SUBSTANTIVE. Substantive comments are provided because
            sections in the training materials appear to be or are potentially incorrect,
            incomplete, misleading, or confusing.
            1.2.7.6.1.4. ADMINISTRATIVE.           Administrative      comments      correct

        1.2.8.1. Monitor and manage assigned and attached crewmember currencies and
        requirements.
        1.2.8.2. Ensure crewmembers participate only in events and tasks for which they are
        adequately prepared, trained, and current.
        1.2.8.3. Identify areas where additional training is needed and direct training
        accordingly.
        1.2.8.4. Ensure mission objectives are prebriefed, debriefed, and evaluated to determine
        successful accomplishments.
     1.2.9. Individual crewmembers will:
        1.2.9.1. Know and complete training requirements and currencies IAW Chapter 4 of this
        volume and applicable RAP tasking memorandum.
        1.2.9.2. Not participate in activities/events for which they are not trained, qualified, or
        current unless under appropriate supervision.
1.3. Processing Changes.
     1.3.1. Forward recommendations for change to this volume to applicable MAJCOM/A3
     through appropriate channels on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
     1.3.2. MAJCOMs will forward recommendation copies of any MAJCOM supplement to this
     volume to HQ ACC/A3 for coordination prior to HQ USAF/A3O approval.
     1.3.3. HQ ACC/A3 will:
        1.3.3.1. Coordinate all changes to the basic volume with applicable MAJCOM/A3s.
        1.3.3.2. Forward recommendations for change to HQ USAF/A3O-A for approval.
        1.3.3.3. Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message.
1.4. Training. CRC/DRU training is designed to progress crewmembers from Initial
Qualification Training (IQT) (Basic Course or Re-Qualification Training)to Mission
Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT). A qualification is
awarded to each individual upon the successful completion of IQT/RQT and/or MQT. The
qualification statuses consist of Basic Qualification (BQ), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), and
Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
     1.4.1. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify individuals to perform specific
     duties/tasks on specific equipment and/or in a basic crew position without regard to the unit’s
     mission. Upon completion of IQT, individuals attain a BQ status. (see Chapter 2).
        1.4.1.1. BQ individuals have completed an evaluation and are qualified to perform
        CRC/DRU basic crew positional duties in the CRC/DRU. The Squadron CC will
        determine those missions that BQ crewmembers may perform unsupervised.
        1.4.1.2. BQ is a prerequisite for MQT.
     1.4.2. MQT provides individuals the advanced training necessary to qualify in an assigned
     crew position to perform the command’s and their unit’s missions. Individuals maintain BQ
     status until completion of MQT. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for CMR/BMC. (see
     Chapter 3).
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                11


  1.4.3. CT provides crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix of training necessary
  to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification level. RAP is the combat coded/DOC
  tasked unit CT program designed to focus training toward needed combat/contingency skills.
  Specific RAP instructions are issued by MAJCOMs via a RAP tasking memorandum. (see
  Chapter 4).
  1.4.4. Crewmembers will have received formal training in their crew position and the basic
  missions of their specific assigned/attached unit upon completion of IQT and all missions for
  MQT. Upon completion of MQT, crewmembers will then be designated either CMR or
  BMC.
     1.4.4.1. CMR. CMR crewmembers will maintain currencies and proficiency in all core
     missions of the unit to which they are assigned. These currencies and events are outlined
     in Chapter 4 or the applicable RAP Tasking Memorandum.
     1.4.4.2. BMC. BMC designated crewmembers have primary jobs or staff functions that
     directly support the CRC or a specific DRU mission.
         1.4.4.2.1. DRU BMC crewmembers are fully qualified in the unique mission that
         their specialized unit performs.
         1.4.4.2.2. CRC BMC crewmembers maintain proficiency and qualification in some
         of the unit core missions. CRC BMC crewmembers are needed to provide additional
         mission generation/combat capability in addition to personnel assigned to CMR
         positions at CRC squadrons. CRC BMC crewmembers must be able to attain CMR
         qualification in 30 days or less.
     1.4.4.3. Attached Personnel. HQ ACC/A3YG (HQ USAFE/A3YO for USAFE units)
     will determine/approve attached personnel requirements for personnel assigned above
     Wing level. Attached crewmembers will have a valid AF Form 8, Certificate of Crew
     Qualification, IAW AFI 13-1-1-202V2, Ground Command and Control Systems
     Standardization an Evaluation Program.
         1.4.4.3.1. Attached CRC crewmembers will be BMC qualified crewmembers and are
         not required to maintain CT lookback requirements.
         1.4.4.3.2. Current/qualified attached CRC BMC crewmembers may work without an
         instructor with the following exception. The unit DO will approve utilization of
         attached CRC BMC crewmembers for large force employment and Category 3 live
         exercises.
         1.4.4.3.3. Attached CRC BMC crewmembers are exempt from academic ground
         training and/or special training programs except where specifically directed by the
         host squadron commander.
     1.4.4.4. Unqualified (UQ). Unqualified crewmembers require a mission evaluation
     before progressing to a higher qualification level. UQ crewmembers fall under one or
     more of the following categories:
         1.4.4.4.1. Enrolled in IQT.
         1.4.4.4.2. Downgraded for being Non-Current greater than 180 days.
         1.4.4.4.3. Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability
12                                                             AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009


            1.4.4.4.4. Downgraded for failure to meet standards during an evaluation.
        1.4.4.5. Assigning Crew Member Experience Level. Crewmember experience levels are
        designed to indicate to unit commanders how much training CMR crewmembers need to
        maintain CT/RAP requirements and therefore proficiency. There are two experience
        levels for CMR crewmembers: ―Inexperienced‖ and ―Experienced‖. SQ/CCs may
        reclassify CMR crewmembers as "experienced" based on the criteria outlined below.
        Squadron DOT offices document reclassification as "Combat Mission
        Ready/Experienced" IAW Chapter 7, Operations Documentation.
            1.4.4.5.1. Experienced SD/AWO/WD—An experienced SD/AWO/WD is an
            individual who:
                1.4.4.5.1.1. Has been formally awarded a 13B3/4X/1C5X1D AFSC.
                1.4.4.5.1.2. Has one year in the AFSC after award.
                1.4.4.5.1.3. Performed as a CRC/DRU CMR/BMC SD/WD for a minimum of 6
                months.
                1.4.4.5.1.4. Has at least 50 career controlled events while performing in a
                CMR/BMC status, of which a minimum of 25 must be current assigned unit
                system specific (live/DMO) controlled events.
            1.4.4.5.2. Experienced Surveillance   Officer/Technician—An                 experienced
            ASO/AST/DST/EPT/ST is an individual who:
                1.4.4.5.2.1. Has been formally awarded a 13BXX/1C5X1 AFSC.
                1.4.4.5.2.2. Has one year experience in the AFSC after award.
                1.4.4.5.2.3. Has at least 50 career event operations (see tables in Chapter 4)
                performing duties in a CMR/BMC status, of which 25 must be current assigned
                unit system specific event operations. Note: unit DO may determine equivalent
                general positional hours for individuals that were previously assigned to units that
                did not track event operations.
                1.4.4.5.2.4. Perform in that particular position, as CMR/BMC, for a period of 6
                months.
            1.4.4.5.3. Experienced individuals in all other positions—(e.g. MCC, ICT, BSC)
            must perform in that particular duty position, as CMR/BMC, for a period of 6
            months.
        1.4.4.6. A crewmember’s training cycle CT/RAP requirements are based on the
        crewmember’s current experienced or inexperienced status. When a crewmember
        changes experience levels, training requirements will be prorated from the date of
        experience certification.
     1.4.5. Upgrade/Specialized Training. Upgrade/Specialized training is training in any special
     skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required by every
     crewmember. Upgrade/Specialized training is normally accomplished after a crewmember is
     assigned CMR/BMC status and is normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                      13


   otherwise specified, CMR/BMC crewmembers may hold special certifications/qualifications
   as long as all additional training requirements are accomplished. (see Chapter 5).
      1.4.5.1. Instructor/Evaluator Certified. Instructor/evaluator certified crewmembers are
      trained to instruct and/or evaluate duties associated with their crew positions.
      Instructor/evaluator crewmembers will maintain CMR/BMC status. Instructors may
      perform instructor duties as long as they are CMR/BMC and current in the event they are
      instructing. Instructors/evaluators who become N-CMR/N-BMC may be allowed to
      continue academic and/or crew training device (CTD) instructor duties with Group
      Commander (or equivalent) approval. ANG units and DRUs will request approval
      directly from HQ ACC/A3Y.
          1.4.5.1.1. Instructors monitor their trainee's progress to provide guidance and
          additional instruction as required. Instructors are available to discuss problems the
          trainees may encounter and assist the trainee to ensure satisfactory progress.
          1.4.5.1.2. Throughout training, instructors provide feedback to the trainee to resolve
          problems the trainee encounters. Instructors and supervisors monitor trainee progress
          to detect marginal performance and unsafe practices and initiate corrective actions.
          1.4.5.1.3. Instructors are approved by the commander to conduct training with
          trainees either on an individual basis or in a classroom setting. Instructors can
          augment lesson plans with additional handouts to enhance training if necessary as
          long as they are consistent with and support existing courseware and syllabus
          requirements.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies.
   1.5.1. Training programs will be designed to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, crew capabilities, and safety. This CRC volume provides
   training guidelines and policies to be used with operational procedures specified in other
   applicable flying/operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACS/DRU Commanders and Director of Operations will have or obtain the 13B3D
   AFSC (Non-waiverable). CRC Commanders and DOs will maintain a CRC Mission Crew
   Commander qualification. (see Chapter 6 for additional ACC gained unit guidance).
   1.5.3. Training missions will be designed to successfully achieve/accomplish unit tasked
   missions, roles/capability, maintain proficiency, as well as to enhance safety. RAP training
   missions should emphasize combat/contingency skills through missions/scenarios that reflect
   procedures and operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and
   opposition capabilities. Units will train using procedures and actions applicable to
   combat/contingency scenarios (e.g. appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures,
   combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions,
   intelligence briefings and debriefings).
   1.5.4. Crewmember Supervision. The following personnel must be under the direct
   supervision of an instructor/evaluator when performing mission positional duties/tasks.
      1.5.4.1. Unqualified crewmembers.
14                                                              AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009


        1.5.4.2. Crewmembers performing events in which they are non-current, unqualified or
        not certified.
        1.5.4.3. Crewmembers performing MQT, except as permitted in Chapter 3.
        1.5.4.4. Crewmembers downgraded to N-CMR/N-BMC.
     1.5.5. All rated 13B ABMs must maintain a current qualification and medical clearance
     IAW AFI 11-401, Rated Management. WDs must maintain a ground-based physical profile
     IAW AFI 48-123. (see Chapter 6 for additional guidance for ACC gained units).
     1.5.6. The commander may adjust training time or remove personnel from IQT/MQT
     training due to medical disqualification or Duty Not Involving Controlling/Flying
     (DNIC/DNIF) status, emergency leave, or administrative action. An entry indicating the
     adjustment by the commander will be documented IAW Chapter 7, Operations
     Documentation.
        1.5.6.1. Individuals not performing duties in the operations section because of
        disciplinary, serious administrative issues, or lack of fitness for duty reasons, will not be
        entered into/continued in training. Individuals not performing duties in the operations
        section for reasons of Uniform Code of Military Justice prosecution/conviction, drug
        abuse, conscientious objector status, or loss of security clearance, will not be entered
        into/continued in training.
     1.5.7. Personnel TDY for 30 consecutive days (2 UTAs) or more to locations where
     IQT/MQT/CT is available will accomplish training.
     1.5.8. IQT/MQT/CT personnel who remain in-garrison while the unit deploys for 30
     consecutive days (2 UTAs) or more will also accomplish training, when possible.
     1.5.9. Personnel going PCS or TDY to a unit with the same system (that is, CRC to CRC)
     may be continued in their previous training phase/qualification/certification, following local
     orientation and selected training, if applicable. The completion date and test scores of written
     local area procedures examinations are documented IAW Chapter 7, Operations
     Documentation.
1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management.
     1.6.1. CRC combat/DOC tasked units are scheduled to Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) pairs.
     However, their Low Density/High Demand status drives one common 12-month RAP
     training cycle, (subsequently referred to as Training Cycle) for all units. Each RAP
     qualification level is defined by a total number of RAP events, broken down into event types,
     plus specific qualifications and associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and unit
     commanders. (see Chapter 4).
     1.6.2. In the absence of a current RAP Tasking Memorandum and for non-combat coded
     units, crewmembers/individuals will accomplish the required directed CT events outlined in
     Chapter 4.
     1.6.3. The total number of RAP missions/events accomplished is the primary factor for
     maintaining an individual’s qualification status. A review of the RAP events accomplished
     should also consider specific event types.
     1.6.4. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                15


       1.6.4.1. Lookback at CMR mission/event rate.
       1.6.4.2. Qualification in all missions and any specialized mission training required for
       CMR.
       1.6.4.3. Squadron commander certification.
   1.6.5. Crewmembers will accomplish 3-month required lookback. See Tables 4.1-4.9.
   Requirements for lookback are described in paragraph 4.8.2.
1.7. Training Program Development.
   1.7.1. RAP Tasking Memorandum event requirements apply to CRC CMR and BMC
   crewmembers. The current RAP Tasking memorandum takes precedence over this volume
   and may contain updated definitions and requirements not yet incorporated. The RAP
   Tasking Memorandum will be reviewed by MAJCOM after each training cycle. Standard
   event requirements are established as the minimum number of events per training cycle for
   each of the following levels of training:
       1.7.1.1. BMC. The minimum training required for crewmembers to be familiar in all, and
       to be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions tasked to their assigned
       unit and weapons system.
       1.7.1.2. CMR. The minimum training required for crewmembers to be qualified and
       proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons
       system.
1.8. Training Records and Reports. Units will maintain individual crewmember training
records IAW AFI 33-360, AFI 11-401, AFI 13-1CRCV2, guidance found in Chapter 7,
Operations Documentation of this volume, and appropriate MAJCOM directives.
1.9. Crew Utilization Policy.
   1.9.1. Commanders will ensure crewmembers fill authorized positions IAW unit manning
   documents and their status is properly designated. The overall objective is that crewmembers
   perform combat-related/primary unit mission duties on a regular basis.
   1.9.2. Supervisors may assign crewmembers to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, safety
   board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of
   crewmember tasking, proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.9.3. For inexperienced crewmembers, supervisors make every attempt to limit non-mission
   duties to those related to combat/unit mission training activities.
   1.9.4. Crewmembers will not perform long-term duties that detract from their primary duties
   of training for, or performing the unit combat /specified mission.
1.10. Training Mission/Event Allocation Guidance.
   1.10.1. Inexperienced crewmembers should receive mission/event allocation priority over
   experienced crewmembers. Priorities for mission/event allocation are as follows:
       1.10.1.1. Formal      Training     Units.  Formal     syllabus    training, Instructor
       Qualification/Certification, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing
       Instructor or SEE duties.
16                                                            AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009


        1.10.1.2. Operational Units. IQT, BMC, MQT, and then CMR.
        1.10.1.3. Attached crew members (MAJCOM, Wing, Group, USAFWS), are lower
        priority than the above categories.
        1.10.1.4. Consideration should also be given to requirements directed by MAJCOM to
        include training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, equipment/system
        testing, or TTP validation requirements.
1.11. Waiver Authority:
     1.11.1. HQ ACC/A3Y (ACC/ANG units), and HQ USAFE/A3Y (USAFE units) are the
     waiver authority for all waiver requests to this instruction. File a copy of approved waivers

                                          Chapter 2

                         INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines the conduct of IQT at both the FTU and at the operational
unit level.
   2.1.1. Any individual who has been unqualified for longer than 60 months must accomplish
   IQT through a formally approved crew position program. All individual crewmembers are
   required to meet IQT syllabus standards.
2.2. Authority:
   2.2.1. MAJCOM approved syllabi lay out complete requirements of IQT for each duty
   position. Course syllabi do not take precedence over the guidance in this AFI; however, units
   will conform/adhere to the grading criteria, academic/performance training standards, and
   general/specific instructions unless it specifically conflicts with this AFI.
       2.2.1.1. CRC IQT syllabi and course training documents (CTD) are developed by ACC
       TRSS.
          2.2.1.1.1. Detachment 9, ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS), is responsible for
          developing, maintaining, and updating the syllabi, academic lessons, and developing
          the academic courseware for the lessons outlined in the IQT syllabi. Det 9 ensures
          syllabi are reviewed every 24 months or sooner to account for weapon system
          changes, course critiques, or other data that necessitate earlier review. Det 9
          documents the results of the syllabus review and forwards a copy of the
          documentation to HQ ACC/A3YG, 552 ACG, and HQ ACC TRSS.
          2.2.1.1.2. Course training documents include everything required to conduct the IQT
          program. The training package includes lesson plans, student guides, academic
          lessons, block tests, and ACC Form 206, Individual Mission Grade Sheet, to
          document training results when conducting tasks, simulations, or live fly exercises.
       2.2.1.2. DRUs are responsible for syllabus development in support of their IQT and will
       forward to HQ ACC/A3Y for approval.
          2.2.1.2.1. Once the syllabus is approved, DRUs develop their supporting IQT CTDs.
   2.2.2. IQT is conducted by active duty, ANG, and contracted instructors at both the formal
   training unit (FTU) and at operational units using an ACC approved syllabi.
       2.2.2.1. The 607th Air Control Squadron (ACS) is the FTU for the Combat Air Forces
       (CAF) CRC Weapon System. FTU training will use the HQ ACC/A3-approved syllabi to

        4.6.1.1. At the end of the training cycle, up to 25 percent of Instructor/Evaluator
        monitored events, rounded down to the next whole number, may be credited for required
        positional CT/RAP training cycle events provided the instructor/evaluator monitored
        mission planning and any briefings, missions, and debriefings.
     4.6.2. I/E SDs will not log controlled missions for solely supervising AWOs or WDs
     engaged in aircraft control. In order to log a controlled mission, SDs must meet the
     provisions of paragraph 4.9.7.
4.7. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements.
     4.7.1. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may prorate all positional training
     requirements when:
        4.7.1.1. An individual is TDY, medically disqualified/DNIF, or on emergency leave for
        30 cumulative days (2 UTAs) or more. Normal annual leave will not be considered as
        non-availability.
        4.7.1.2. A unit is deployed to a contingency for more than 30 days.
        4.7.1.3. An individual is upgraded after the start of the training cycle. Training
        accomplished during IQT/MQT will not be counted toward continuation training
        requirements.
     4.7.2. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
     impact on a unit's overall CT program, as emphasis is on supporting contingency operations.
     A potential lack of training on broader DOC mandated CRC missions/tasks could place a
     burden on the unit and impact overall CRC combat mission capability. Commanders will
     take this into consideration during unit regeneration planning, at the end of the training cycle,
     and prior to submitting training cycle waivers. Additionally, the following proration
     procedures are intended to provide commander’s flexibility in accomplishing their unit's CT
     program.
        4.7.2.1. Upon return or relief from contingency operations, units may prorate CT/RAP
        events for the period of time (cumulative) each individual was deployed (see paragraph
        4.14).
     4.7.3. Crewmembers that become CMR/ BMC after the beginning of the training cycle
     accomplish a prorated share of existing training cycle academic TRs for the remainder of the
     period beginning with the first day of the following month.
     4.7.4. All training requirement events are rounded down to the next whole number when
     prorating.
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                             27


   4.7.5. When a crewmember changes experience levels, training requirements will be
   prorated from the first day of the month following experience certification.
   4.7.6. Prorating of requirements will be documented IAW Chapter 7, Operations
   Documentation.
4.8. CMR/BMC Regression. N-CMR/N-BMC crewmembers are not authorized to perform
crew duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision. Downgraded crewmembers must be
requalified.
   4.8.1. Crewmembers shall be regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for one or more of the following
   reasons:
      4.8.1.1. Failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.8.2.
      4.8.1.2. Failure to complete training cycle CT/RAP requirements.
      4.8.1.3. At SQ/CC direction.
   4.8.2. Lookback. Lookback is a management tool used to determine and monitor CRC CMR
   and DRU BMC crewmember proficiency during the training cycle. Lookback does not apply
   to CRC BMC crewmembers.
      4.8.2.1. The COT will calculate the 3-month lookback no later than the 1st day of the
      month or ANG UTA to ensure CMR/BMC (DRU) crewmembers meet lookback
      requirements as described in Tables 4.1 through 4.9.
          4.8.2.1.1. Lookback computations for newly qualified crewmembers begin following
          completion of MQT and 3 full months of CMR/BMC (DRU) status.
      4.8.2.2. Failure to Meet 3-Month Lookback. If a CRC CMR/DRU BMC crewmember
      fails to meet the 3-month lookback requirement, commanders may:
          4.8.2.2.1. Direct the individual be placed into N-CMR/N-BMC (DRU) status or,
          4.8.2.2.2. Place the crewmember in probation status for 1 month (30 days/2 UTAs).
          If commander places the crewmember on probation, the crewmember is required to
          reestablish a 3-month lookback by the end of the probation period to remain
          CMR/BMC (DRU).
      4.8.2.3. Crewmembers that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC (DRU) status for less than 180
      days for not accomplishing lookback will complete a SQ/CC approved re-certification
      process consisting (as a minimum) of the following three steps before returning the
      crewmember to CMR status.
          4.8.2.3.1. Crewmembers who are regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC status must be
          monitored by an instructor for a minimum of two control events for weapons
          personnel, two link events for Interface Control Technicians (ICT) and two event
          operations for all others.
          4.8.2.3.2. Upon completion of the recertification program and an instructor’s
          recommendation, the COT places the individual back into CMR/BMC status.
28                                                        AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009


          4.8.2.3.3. The missions and events accomplished during a recertification program
          may be credited toward a crewmember’s 3-month lookback and total mission/event
          requirements for the training cycle.
       4.8.2.4. If the crewmember is N-CMR/N-BMC for more than 180 days, downgrade the
       crewmember to UQ status and enter into remedial training with subsequent reevaluation.
       4.8.2.5. Document all actions IAW Chapter 7, Operations Documentation.

4.9. Crew Training Requirements: The CT/RAP training cycle consists of academic and
positional training requirements.
   4.9.1. Academic Training Requirements. The intent of the academic portion of CMR/BMC
   continuation training is to keep day-to-day training relevant and current with the units DOC
   tasked missions as well as dynamic real-world contingency environment and ever-changing
   tactics, techniques and procedures.
      4.9.1.1. The unit COT develops an Academic CT/RAP Plan based on the review, update,
      and expansion of existing IQT/MQT materials, the inclusion of current RAP tasking
      memorandum training areas, as well as the introduction of any unit unique current theater
      interest/focus areas. The COT also includes in the academic training plan any Group or
      above training inputs/guidance. The proposed plan is submitted to the unit DO NLT 15
      days prior to the start of the next training cycle for approval.
      4.9.1.2. The COT, with the approval of the DO, is authorized to adjust the training plan,
      throughout the training cycle, to meet a dynamic operational training environment or to
      address any negative trends.
      4.9.1.3. The COT ensures documentation of academic CT/RAP academic training IAW
      Chapter 7, Operations Documentation.
   4.9.2. Positional Training Requirements. The intent of the positional portion of CMR/BMC
   continuation training is to keep crewmembers proficient in the skill sets outlined in AFI 13-
   1CRC Vol. 3.
      4.9.2.1. The COT will ensure CMR/BMC individuals meet positional training cycle
      requirements as described in tables 4.10 through 4.18.
30                                                            AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009


            4.9.2.1.1. The COT ensures documentation of academic CT/RAP positional training
            IAW Chapter 7, Operations Documentation.
        4.9.2.2. Failure to Meet Positional Training Requirements.
            4.9.2.2.1. Unless waived IAW paragraph 4.4, crewmembers who fail to accomplish
            positional training requirements are regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC status.
            4.9.2.2.2. Unless waived, the crewmember will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until all
            overdue positional training requirements are accomplished or the crewmember
            accomplishes appropriate/specific training, as directed by SQ/CC.
            4.9.2.2.3. Unless specifically waived IAW paragraph 4.4, all training requirements
            for the previous training cycle must be completed before events are credited toward
            the next training cycle.
        4.9.2.3. End-of-training-cycle crewmember status will be reported to MAJCOM in the
        next training report (see paragraphs 1.2.6.7 and 4.15).
     4.9.3. Squadron Commanders must inform applicable MAJCOM through their chain of
     command as soon as a potential shortfall of missions may result in individuals not meeting
     their training cycle requirements.
     4.9.4. DOs will ensure DMO/simulated missions are accomplished in the most effective
     manner possible and where live missions are deficient/insufficient. Simulated
     missions/scenarios should also stress increasingly more difficult operations as individual
     crewmembers, and crews in general, become more proficient. Finally, DMO/simulated
     missions should stress skills or situations that are not normally controlled under live
     conditions (e.g., aircraft emergencies, multiple intercepts).
        4.9.4.1. In order to log WD/AWO/SD DMO control events for lookback and training
        cycle events, the control events must be accomplished using DMO virtual entities or
        Distributed Training Operations Center (DTOC) entity that is utilizing Constructive
        Workstations (CWS). Additionally, these control events must be briefed/debriefed IAW
        AFI 11-214.
            4.9.4.1.1. Although units should take advantage of all training opportunities
            available, DMO missions conducted without using DMO virtual entities or CMW
            entities will not be logged/counted toward WD/AWO/SD controlled event
            requirements.
            4.9.4.1.2. Only scenarios or missions which include virtual entities will be logged as
            controlled events. Constructive entities will be logged as simulator events.
            4.9.4.1.3. Positional event operations for MCC/ASO/AST/ICT/DST/ST duty
            positions may be logged/counted for any DMO/DTOC mission/exercise.
     4.9.5. CT-CMR/BMC Positional Training Requirements (TR) are expressed in terms of
     Events.
        4.9.5.1. Battle Staff TRs are expressed in terms of event operation.
        4.9.5.2. Weapons personnel TRs are expressed in terms of control events.
        4.9.5.3. Surveillance personnel TRs are expressed in terms of event operation.
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                    31


      4.9.5.4. Tactical Data link personnel TRs are expressed in terms of link events.
   4.9.6. MCC:
      4.9.6.1. Event Operation. MCC mission plans, supervises the mission crew, debriefs
      mission/crew exercise. Performs duties as the primary MCC for approximately 50 percent
      of the mission/crew exercise. MCC supervises the crew (weapons team led by the SD
      and/or surveillance team led by the ASO or AST) operations for a minimum of 1 hour.
      4.9.6.2. Link Event. The MCC credits one Tactical Data Link (TDL) event each time
      they perform the CMR/BMC duty position and a TDL interface is functioning.
          4.9.6.2.1. The MCC will be involved in duty related link management tasks to
          include     coordinating     real-time    link     plans/operations      with   other
          platforms/organizations, ensuring the crew is prepared to link, ensuring crewmembers
          perform link-related duties properly, providing adaptation parameters/data recording
          requirements (initial or changes) to the computer section, transmitting weapons
          status/air defense warnings, and understanding the roles and responsibilities of
          participants in the link.
      4.9.6.3. See paragraph 4.6 for Instructor/Evaluator event logging instructions.

   4.9.7. SD:
      4.9.7.1. Event Operation. SD conducts mission planning and supervises WDs/AWOs
      engaged in aircraft control and operations execution. The SD establishes and manages
      communications with external agencies and performs duties as the primary SD for
      approximately 50 percent of the mission/crew operations but for not less than one hour.
      4.9.7.2. Controlled Event. A controlled mission will include control of any of the
      following mission types: air-to-air employment, dynamic targeting (DT), close air
      support (CAS), combat search and rescue (CSAR), air refueling (A/R). A controlled
      event must be live or DMO from check-in to hand-off or until the criteria for swapping
      controllers is met IAW paragraph 4.9.8.5.
          4.9.7.2.1. SDs may control one side of a mission (4v4 or less) and still perform SD
          duties and may credit a controlled event and event operation. The DO will implement
          policy to determine how many simultaneous events a SD can supervise and still
          control.

          4.9.7.2.2. BMC personnel may substitute air-to-air missions for refueling and air-to-
          surface missions at a 1-for-1 ration.
          4.9.7.2.3. When live air-to-surface missions are not available, non-DMO units may
          substitute live requirements with simulation at a 2-for-1 ratio.
       4.9.7.3. Link Event. SD credits one TDL event each time they perform in their
       CMR/BMC duty position and a TDL interface is functioning.
          4.9.7.3.1. The SD should be involved in duty related tasks such as ensuring the
          weapons section is prepared to operate within the link, sending or resolving command
          messages, and coordinating with MCC (or equivalent) at linked units.
       4.9.7.4. See paragraph 4.6 for Instructor/Evaluator event logging instructions.

     4.9.8. AWO/WD:
       4.9.8.1. Controlled Event. A controlled event will include control of any of the following
       mission types: air-to-air employment, air-to-surface, combat search and rescue (CSAR),
       air refueling (A/R) (must be live or DMO, see paragraph 4.9.4.1.), from check-in to hand-
       off or until the criteria for swapping controllers is met.
          4.9.8.1.1. A controlled event may be credited when the following criteria are met:
              4.9.8.1.1.1. Briefed the mission.
              4.9.8.1.1.2. Took radar/radio control of the aircraft performing the mission.
              4.9.8.1.1.3. Accomplished at least one of the following, air-to-air, air refueling,
              or air-to-surface mission.
              4.9.8.1.1.4. Debriefed the mission.
          4.9.8.1.2. Air-to-Air Event. The AWO/WD directs at least one flight of aircraft
          conducting air-to-air tactics against a dedicated adversary. The AWO/WD will
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                   33


        control the flight from check-in to check-out, or until the criteria for swapping
        controllers is met. A flight will contain at least two aircraft.
        4.9.8.1.3. Air Refueling Event. The AWO/WD provides control to an aircraft/flight
        conducting A/R IAW AFI 11-214 and Allied Tactical Pamphlet 56B. The AWO/WD
        must provide close or tactical control to an aircraft, or flight of aircraft (where flight
        integrity is maintained) that rendezvous with a tanker/cell (or fighter simulating a
        tanker). During A/Rs, the AWO/WD may credit one A/R mission per set of receivers
        or single receiver. Weapons personnel may also credit more than one type mission
        during combined missions, in cases where the flight conducts another mission in
        addition to the refueling. For example, if the AWO/WD conducts a rendezvous into a
        tanker then takes the fighters off tanker and conducts intercepts, the weapons
        individual credits both an A/R and an air-to-air mission. The A/R missions must be
        conducted in a live or DMO environment.
        4.9.8.1.4. Air-to-Surface Event. The AWO/WD directs at least one flight of aircraft
        conducting air-to-surface tactics against a ground objective. The AWO/WD will
        control the flight from check-in to the prosecution of at least one objective, or until
        the criteria for swapping controllers is met. An air-to surface mission should include
        the following elements:
           4.9.8.1.4.1. Airspace management: Assigning altitude blocks, and/or safe
           deconfliction between aircraft (manned/unmanned)
           4.9.8.1.4.2. Target Area Brief: Air or ground picture and the objective area
           4.9.8.1.4.3. Dynamic/deliberate Tasking: Updated or pre-planned objective
           4.9.8.1.4.4. MISREP: Mission results documented and passed.
        4.9.8.1.5. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Event. CSAR events are logged as air-
        to-surface events.
           4.9.8.1.5.1. Manages/positions CSAR participants while executing preplanned or
           real-time CSAR plan to include control or coordination of CSAR air support and
           Suppression of Enemy Air Defense.
           4.9.8.1.5.2. Manages CSAR airspace in the CSAR area, if tasked. Assigns
           altitude blocks and establishes deconfliction plan between aircraft to include
           manned/unmanned assets.
           4.9.8.1.5.3. Establishes/executes the CSAR communications plan
           4.9.8.1.5.4. MISREP: Documents and passes CSAR results.
     4.9.8.2. Link Event. The AWO/WD credits one TDL event each time they perform in
     their respective CMR/BMC duty position and a TDL interface is functioning.
        4.9.8.2.1. The crew should be involved in duty related tasks such as preparing to link,
        entering/exiting/maintaining the link, ensuring current/accurate air situation data,
        designing/implementing/monitoring filters, and coordinating changes to
        frequencies/crypto modes/ keys and the areas of responsibility.

        4.9.8.3. BMC personnel may substitute air-to-air missions for A/R and air-to-surface
        missions at a 1-for-1 ratio.
        4.9.8.4. Non-DMO units may substitute live/DMO air-to-surface requirements with
        simulation at a 2-for-1 ratio.
        4.9.8.5. Swapping controllers: During air-to-air employment, A/R, air-to-surface
        missions, or CSAR missions controllers may hand off control of the mission to another
        controller so that more than one individual may log a controlled mission for a single set
        of activity. When swapping controllers on an air-to-air employment or Composite Force
        Training (CFT) mission, each controller must control fighters from fights-on/vul time
        through terminate/knock-it-off using close or tactical control. Additionally, controllers
        must control at least two passes prior to swapping controllers. For A/R mission each
        controller must meet the minimum A/R mission requirements in order to log a controlled
        mission. For air-to-surface missions the AWO/WD must control the flight during the
        prosecution of at least one ground objective.
        4.9.8.6. See paragraph 4.6 for Instructor/Evaluator event logging instructions.

     personnel who use any form of radio communication. Operations personnel will be
     thoroughly familiar with communications jamming (COMM JAM) procedures, such as
     recognition, reporting, and resolution.
        4.9.15.1. Unit DOs or designated representative will ensure sufficient communications
        jamming training occurs to adequately prepare personnel to operate in a communications
        jamming environment.
4.10. Mission Training Program Requirements. (N/A to DRU and FTU)
     4.10.1. Mission training is an extremely important part of the training program. Each unit
     COT aggressively seeks out opportunities to train with elements of the ground TACS and
     Airborne Elements of the TACS (AETACS), as well as other services. Units should
     participate in Command sponsored exercises to the maximum extent possible.
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                   39


   4.10.2. MAJCOMs are responsible for establishing guidance for the MTP. The program will
   provide procedural information for administering the MTP to include the MTEs. This
   instruction establishes training frequency requirements for Category 1 and 2/3 MTEs at Table
   4.19.
      4.10.2.1. Duty related tasks will be performed during either live or simulator training
      exercises (such as MTEs/JEs)). COT will record academic and positional TRs on AF
      Form 4142.
   4.10.3. Categories of MTEs. These events are categorized by the number of participating
   units and the level of effort within each unit. There are three categories of MTEs.
      4.10.3.1. Category I (CAT I). Training which exercises crew positions of a single unit
      (no external participants/agencies). The scope may vary from positional training for a
      single section to involvement of an entire operations crew.
      4.10.3.2. Category II (CAT II). Small scale DMO events interfacing the CRC with a
      DMO capable weapons system to execute TTPs and focused mission type training. The
      MTE should include operational data link with at least two data link capable units
      participating. CAT II also includes training with other external agencies and is not limited
      to the DMO environment.
          4.10.3.2.1. CRC’s distributed interface with a single weapon system (F-15, F-16, A-
          10, etc).
          4.10.3.2.2. CRC to CRC/AWACS distributed interface for lateral unit TTP training.
          4.10.3.2.3. An example of specific type mission event would be reflected in CAS,
          CSAR, TIC, Interdiction, and TST scenarios with associated virtual/actual weapons
          systems participating.
      4.10.3.3. Category III (CAT III). (Multiple external agencies usually on DMON or
      JTEN). Large scale training exercises interfacing crews into a multi-unit distributed
      scenario. Every DMO event using a distributed network will require a review and
      compliance with security interface standards for the distributed network and interfacing
      weapons system. The MTE should include an operational data link with at least two data
      link capable units participating. The training emphasis is centered on accomplishing the
      interactions which are essential to CRC operations, and must include interfacing with
      another element of the TACS. This should include a higher headquarters element and at
      least one other Air Force or joint/combined service element such as the U.S. Army’s
      Phased Array Tracking Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) Air Defense Artillery (ADA)
      system. Units are required to participate in large scale joint exercises i.e. Virtual Flags
      (VF), Fleet Synthetic Training-Joint (FST-J) events, Joint Kill Chain Events (JKCE),
      Warfighter Focused Events (WFE), Red Flag, etc.

 NOTES:
 1. Participation in a live exercise can be a substitute for MTE requirements on a one-for-one basis.
 2. Units may credit excess CAT 2/3 MTEs toward their CAT 1 MTE requirements on a one-for-one
 basis.
 3. CRCs may simulate an AOC for two CAT 2/3 MTEs if the AOC is unavailable. However,
 connectivity must occur on all six CAT 2/3 with at least one external unit.
 4. Units may prorate MTEs IAW paragraph 4.7, when the entire unit is deployed to a contingency more
 than 30 days.
 5. Duty related tasks may be performed during either live or simulator training exercises (such as
 MTEs/JEs)). Record academic and positional TRs on AF Form 4142.
 6. Does not apply to BMC crew members.


4.11. Currencies /Recurrency/Requalification.
     4.11.1. Currency. Positional currencies are established to ensure the average crewmember
     maintains a minimum level of proficiency in a given event; the ability to safely conduct the
     event. See Table 4.20 and the RAP Tasking Memorandum for currency requirements for all
     crew positions. If a crewmember loses a particular currency, that event may not be performed
     except for the purpose of regaining currency. Instructors will be certified and current in all
     events they are instructing.

NOTE: CRC BMC crewmembers maintain the same currencies as CRC CMR crewmembers for
the specified time period. Expiration of currency does not require CMR/BMC regression (see
paragraph 4.11.2)


     4.11.2. Recurrency. If a crewmember is placed into non-current status, an instructor must
     supervise the crewmember performing the particular event. If the instructor deems the event
     successful, the COT will restore currency and document IAW Chapter 7, Ops
     Documentation.
     4.11.3. Requalification. Any previously qualified individual who has been unqualified for
     less than 60 months will enter requalification training. The unit DO and COT will review the
     records of newly assigned personnel and recommend to the CC an appropriate course of
     training based on the individual's background and experience. The COT records the review
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                41


   IAW Chapter 7, Operations Training Documentation. The DO will ensure the COT provides
   the appropriate amount of training in each academic and positional area. The COT will use
   the MAJCOM IQT syllabi and other locally developed training materials to conduct
   requalification training. Requalification training is used to requalify:
      4.11.3.1. Previously qualified crewmembers returning to the CRC/DRU or
      4.11.3.2. Crewmembers that have become unqualified due to loss of currency exceeding
      180 days, or
      4.11.3.3. Due to a downgrade by the squadron commander for demonstrated lack of
      ability/proficiency, or
      4.11.3.4. Crewmembers who fail a positional evaluation or fail to complete a re-
      evaluation by the scheduled date.
      4.11.3.5. See paragraph 4.12.3.2 for crewmembers that fail to requalify.
4.12. Unqualified (UQ). Unqualified is the status to which the unit commander downgrades a
formerly qualified individual for failure to maintain proficiency.
   4.12.1. The unit commander will direct downgrade of a CMR/BMC qualified individual to
   UQ status when the individual fails any positional evaluation, fails to complete a QUAL
   MSN by the scheduled date, fails to regain currency within 180 days, or the unit commander
   determines an individual to be non-proficient. When an individual is downgraded to UQ, the
   unit commander will do one of the following:
      4.12.1.1. Approve trainee entry into remedial training for 30 days (2 UTAs) as required
      or
      4.12.1.2. Take appropriate administrative action IAW AFI 36-2101, Attachment 5,
      and/or AFI 11-402.
   4.12.2. Upon successful completion of the remedial training, the COT releases the individual
   to Stan/Eval to complete the RQ within 30 days (2 UTAS).
   4.12.3. NLT the 30th calendar day (4 UTAs), of the remedial training period one of the
   following occurs:
      4.12.3.1. The trainee completes the TRs, is certified for the RQ by the COT, and passes
      the RQ, or
      4.12.3.2. The trainee does not complete the TRs, is not certified ready for the RQ by the
      COT, or fails the re-examination. The trainee is referred to the unit commander. The unit
      commander takes appropriate administrative action IAW AFI 36-2101, Attachment 5
      and/or AFI 11-402, or requests another 30 calendar days (2 UTAs) remedial training
      through the appropriate Group Commander to HQ ACC/A3YG (HQ USAFE/A3YO for
      USAFE units).
          4.12.3.2.1. Any commander in the individual’s chain of command may deny the
          request, at which point the unit commander takes action IAW AFI 36-2101,
          Attachment 5 and/or AFI 11-402, but the MAJCOM is the final approval for the
          additional 30 days of remedial training. If the commander decides to pursue an
          additional 30 calendar days of training, the trainee will immediately enter the 30
42                                                            AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009


            calendar day extension while the request is being staffed. These days will count
            towards the 30 days of remedial training.
4.13. Unit Certification Program. Unit-unique positions (non-CMR/BMC) will be given a
certified status. When applicable, each unit will develop and implement a training program for
all unit certified positions.
4.14. Multiple Systems Qualified Personnel. Multiple system-qualified personnel (e.g., MCE,
BC3, Digicom, NAWCS/TDF, BCS-F) are only required to meet CT/RAP TRs as if qualified on
a single system with the additional guidance below.
     4.14.1. Events accumulated during a TDY status, to include contingency operations, may be
     logged as CT/RAP events and may count toward training cycle events with the following
     exceptions:
        4.14.1.1. A crewmember’s primary system training cycle events will never be less than
        50 percent of total requirements.
        4.14.1.2. Contingency events will not count for more than 50 percent of total CT/RAP
        cycle requirements (see paragraph 4.7.2).
4.15. Training Deficiency Reports. This paragraph prescribes methods for units to submit
training deficiency reports. Units are required to provide a training status IAW the Status of
Resources and Training System/Ready Aircrew Program reporting requirements.
     4.15.1. A unit commander submits a TDR to identify problems beyond the unit’s ability to
     resolve and that may prevent the unit, or individual(s) from satisfying academic or positional
     TRs. TDRs identify known or potential training problems to Higher Headquarters for
     information and management purposes. TDR identified issues should be resolved at the
     lowest level of command.
     4.15.2. As minimum, the unit commander submits the following information:
        4.15.2.1. Broken equipment that has an impact on training (to include simulation
        equipment)
        4.15.2.2. Lack of live and DMO events for training
        4.15.2.3. Lack of live and DMO events for evaluations

                             UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General.
     5.1.1. Upgrade training, for the purposes of this AFI, is defined as specific academic and
     positional training required to qualify/certify in a supervisory/higher crew position that has as
     a prerequisite, a current or previous qualification in another crew position (or experience
     level) within the same weapon system.
     5.1.2. This chapter outlines/establishes the minimum eligibility criteria and the training
     requirements for upgrade and specialized training.
5.2. Requirements. Upgrade training requirements provide crewmembers with the academic,
crew training device, and/or control activity needed to attain a supervisory/higher level of crew
qualification.
5.3. Waivers/Extensions. Group CCs (HQ ACC/A3YG for DRUs and ANG CRCs) or their
designated representatives are the waiver authority for upgrade requirements/prerequisites. In
cases where current conflicts exist between initial qualification training and upgrade training
guidance, initial qualification training guidance will take precedence.
5.4. Instructor Upgrade. Instructor upgrade training prepares crewmembers for qualification
or certification (this is system specific, see glossary definitions) as an instructor in their present
crew position.
     5.4.1. Academic Training. All academic training for Instructor Upgrade is accomplished
     IAW MAJCOM approved syllabi.
     5.4.2. Crew training device utilization. All crew training device events for Instructor
     Upgrade are accomplished IAW MAJCOM approved syllabi.
     5.4.3. Non-Waiverable Prerequisites. All crewmembers must be rated as experienced in their
     current crew position. Enlisted crewmembers must also hold a 5-skill level before being
     nominated as an instructor and entry into a CAF Instructor Training Program.
     5.4.4. Prerequisites. Instructors will be qualified and experienced in the duty position they
     are to instruct. The following additional prerequisites may be used by squadron commanders
     as a guide to nominate crew members for instructor upgrade.
        5.4.4.1. USAFWS graduates may be recommended for Instructor MCC/SD/ASO (or
        similar duty positions) upgrade after 4 months as a CMR crewmember and exhibiting
        necessary CRC or DRU equipment knowledge. USAFWS graduates assigned to Nellis
        AFB are immediately assigned as instructors upon completion of MSN EVAL and placed
        in Instructor ABM upgrade as determined by the 8 WPS/CC
        5.4.4.2. Those individuals who were instructor qualified on other weapons systems may
        be nominated for instructor upgrade upon being rated as ―experienced.‖
     5.4.5. Crew Position Specific Instruction.
        5.4.5.1. Because the duties of the Air Surveillance Officer (ASO) and Air Surveillance
        Technician (AST) encompass the duties of Surveillance Technician (ST), Data System
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                    45


       Technician (DST), and Interface Control Technician (ICT), Instructor ASO/ ASTs are
       authorized to instruct these crew positions as well as each other’s position.
       5.4.5.2. Similarly, Instructor Senior Directors (SD) may instruct Air Weapons Officers
       (AWO) and Weapons Directors (WD). Additionally, Instructor AWOs and Instructor
       WDs may instruct other AWOs, WDs, as well as the weapons portion of SD training.
   5.4.6. Upon completion of the CAF training program and locally developed procedures, the
   unit COT submits a formal letter to the commander, through the DO, to appoint an individual
   as an instructor. This qualification/certification will be documented Record this review IAW
   Chapter 7, Operations Training Documentation.
   5.4.7. For units that have an instructor certification program vice an instructor qualification
   program the following applies:
       5.4.7.1. DOs will ensure all instructors are observed every 17 months during positional
       instruction to ensure the crewmember meets instructor certification requirements.
       5.4.7.2. If certified to instruct multiple positions, individuals need only be observed once
       in any of their instructor certified positions.
       5.4.7.3. Personnel removed as instructors for any reason are not automatically reinstated,
       they must be re-nominated by letter from the COT and reapproved by the squadron
       commander.
       5.4.7.4. Record instructor reviews IAW Chapter 7, Operations Training Documentation.
5.5. Specialized Training. Within the CRC, there are specific responsibilities, duties, or tasks
that fall outside the formal training area and only require certification to document competency
in specific or particular duties/tasks.
   5.5.1. Senior Weapons Director (SWD) Certification.
       5.5.1.1. Prerequisites. The prerequisites to become a certified SWD, with the
       responsibility for supervising a routine in-garrison mission, in lieu of having a Senior
       Director in place, are outlined in AFI 13-1CRC Vol. 3, paragraph 5.8.2.1.
       5.5.1.2. SWD training will be accomplished IAW ACC SWD training program prior to
       task certification by an authorized certification official.
       5.5.1.3. Academic and position training requirements must be accomplished and
       documented on AF 797 prior to certification. Additionally, this certification must be
       accomplished annually and documented on AF 1098 and IAW Chapter 7, Operations
       Training Documentation.
       5.5.1.4. The duration of the certification will be specified by the commander but will not
       be longer than 17 months from the completion of the training.
   5.5.2. Radar Preparation Assessment Certification. The AN/TPS-75 Radar Preparation
   Assessment Certification Program has been established to task certify individuals to conduct
   the in-garrison AN/TPS-75 daily radar preparation in lieu of a qualified Electronic Protection
   Technician.

        certification by an authorized certification official.
        5.5.2.3. Academic and position training requirements must be must be accomplished and
        documented on AF 797 prior to certification. This certification must be accomplished
        annually and documented on AF 1098 and IAW Chapter 7, Operations Training
        Documentation.
        5.5.2.4. The duration of the certification will be specified by the commander but will not
        be longer than 17 months from the completion of the training.
5.6. Positional Upgrades. Some mission crew positions lead to upgrades to higher qualification
levels.
     5.6.1. Skill level requirements for BSC, AST, DST, ICT, and EPT crew positions are
     outlined in AFI 13-1CRC Vol. 3. All academic and crew training device training will be
     IAW course training documents and MAJCOM-approved syllabi.
     5.6.2. Air Battle Managers (ABM) require a minimum of 18 months (36 UTAs) CMR/BMC
     status as an AWO prior to entering SD or ASO upgrade training.
        5.6.2.1. Air Battle Managers with more than 18 months experience in the 13B career
        field may be entered directly into SD/ASO training per unit manning needs; however, to
        be entered into SD training, the individual must have previously held a weapons
        qualification in a command and control weapon system.
     5.6.3. Direct Reporting Units will specify their equivalent duty positions in Chapter 6 or a
     unit supplement approved by MAJCOM.
5.7. Qualification Transfers/Difference Training. CRC/DRU crewmembers changing
assignments or TDY to a unit/location with the same weapon system or mission equipment (e.g.,
MCE to MCE) may be continued in their previous training phase/qualification/certification,
following local orientation and if appropriate, difference training. Specifically, CRC/DRU
difference training will be accomplished for crewmembers qualified in a duty position but
transferring to a CRC or DRU with specialized/unique equipment.

                      OPERATIONS TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Introduction. Documentation of academic and positional training accomplishments
provide a current record of an individual’s training during the past three months, the past year,
and during his/her career. This information is vital for an accurate assessment of the individual’s
three-month lookback, training cycle TRs, as well as overall experience level. Units with access
to the LMS will use it to document academic and positional training accomplishments.
7.2. Operations Training Records Maintenance. Unit COT will maintain operations training
records for all assigned/attached personnel.
7.3. Forms. This instruction prescribes and directs the use of AF Forms 4141 and 4142 and
refers to AF Form 8, which is prescribed by AFI 13-1-1-202, Vol. 2, and adopts it for use in this
AFI. Instructions for filling in information on all three of these forms are contained within the
electronic form and this chapter.
     7.3.1. AF Form 4141, Individual’s Record of Duties and Experience Ground Environment
     Personnel/ Learning History within the LMS.
        7.3.1.1. The COT maintains an AF Form 4141/ Learning History within the LMS on all
        personnel entered into training.
        7.3.1.2. Completed forms are maintained IAW paragraph 7.4.1.
     7.3.2. AF Form 4142, Individual Annual Training Record.
        7.3.2.1. The DOT maintains an AF Form 4142 for the following personnel:
            7.3.2.1.1. Assigned/attached personnel possessing a 13BXX/1C5X1/1C5X1D AFSC
            who are required to maintain CMR/BMC qualification.
            7.3.2.1.2. A separate AF Form 4142 must be maintained for each duty
            position/qualification.
        7.3.2.2. Completed AF Forms 4142 are maintained IAW paragraph 7.4.1.
     7.3.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Crew Qualification. IAW AFI13-1-1-202 Vol. 2, this form
     is used during the positional evaluation. The AF Form 8 is filed IAW AFI13-1-1-202 Vol. 2,
     however, the COT annotates completion of the evaluation on the AF Form 4141/ Learning
     History within the LMS.
7.4. Permanent Training Record. The COT maintains a permanent training record for all
assigned and attached personnel. The COT uses individual 6-part folders and identifies each
folder by typing the individual’s last name, first name, and middle initial in capital letters on a
standard size folder label. This label is affixed to the folder’s tab. The training officer may pencil
in additional information on the label (e.g., rank, crew, director designator). Tests or test answer
sheets are not filed in this folder. Current AF Forms 4141/ Learning History within the LMS
/4142 may be kept in a separate binder for ease of record keeping, but forms will be returned to
the permanent training records prior to the individual’s permanent change of station. The
permanent training record is organized as follows:
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                    49


   7.4.1. Section I, Qualification Data. This section contains the current copy of Learning
   History and AF Form 4142. Place the Learning History on the left side and AF Form 4142 on
   the right side of Section I. A DD Form 2861, Cross-Reference, can be used to reflect the
   location of the information.
   7.4.2. Section II, Personal History. This section contains any other                    current
   records/documents pertaining to qualification or proficiency, to include waivers.
   7.4.3. Section III, Medical Qualification/Medical Waivers. This section includes a current
   copy of the annual AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
   Operational Duty, for all 13BXD/1C5X1D personnel. An AF Form 1042 placing a
   weapons-qualified individual on DNIC status is also kept during the DNIC period. When
   applicable, the AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, is placed behind
   the current AF Form 1042. In addition, medical profiles that affect operational status will be
   filed in this section. Sensitive medical history or other records of a personal medical nature
   will not be maintained in this file. If medical documentation is sensitive, a memo for record,
   signed by the commander, is placed in this section. This memo states the individual is
   removed from training and includes dates, if available. After a controller is placed on duty
   not including controlling (DNIC) status, DOT will keep the AF Form 1042, Medical
   Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, during the DNIC period (30 days
   or more), file it in the transitory files and annotate AF Form 4141/Learning History within
   the LMS.
   7.4.4. Section IV, Training History. This section includes certificates from AETC courses,
   MAJCOM formal courses, and any formal ground environment training. This material is
   filed chronologically with the latest date on top and kept as a permanent part of this folder.
   Locally generated training records may be maintained in this section while the individual is
   in IQT/MQT training. Also contained are commander’s justifications for late entry into IQT.
   System specific task/task qualification, or the computer-generated product, is maintained in
   this section or in a database. However, upon PCS, all computerized products must be
   translated into hardcopy and placed in the section.
   7.4.5. Section V, Miscellaneous Experience. This section contains completed AF Form
   4141/4142, Student Learning History and control experience forms from other commands.
   File these forms chronologically with the latest date on top as a permanent part of the training
   folder.
7.5. Transfer of Records. Upon reassignment (PCS/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA)
only), a student will hand carry the permanent records to the gaining unit. If the gaining unit has
access to the LMS then the losing COT will notify the LMS Help Desk by email at ACC
DOYG.LMS@langley.af.mil to coordinate transferring the individual to the gaining unit’s
domain.
   7.5.1. Where available, the information required by AF Forms 4141/4142 will be maintained
   within the LMS IAW MAJCOM guidance (instead of hardcopy). If the LMS version is used,
   upon PCS/TDY, the losing unit will contact the LMS Help Desk and request the individual’s
   record be placed in a ―hold‖ status and DOT will print a hard copy of the Learning History to
   be hand carried with the individual. Upon in-processing operations training, the gaining
   unit’s COT will contact the LMS Help Desk to have the individual’s record entered into their
   unit’s domain. If the individual is PCSing to a unit that does not have LMS access, print a
50                                                             AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009


     hardcopy of the individual’s Learning History, place in training folder, and hand carry to next
     unit.
7.6. Documentation. Training is documented on three forms: AF Form 4141, AF Form 4142,
and AF Form 8. The LMS will be used as the primary system of documentation for those units
that access the LMS.
     7.6.1. AF Form 4141. This form is used to record significant occurrences during an
     individual’s training. The following events must be recorded:
        7.6.1.1. The DO will review all newly arriving individuals’ training records and DOT
        will record the review in LMS.
        7.6.1.2. When an individual has completed a transfer of training status from another unit,
        the COT will enter completion date and test scores.
        7.6.1.3. The COT will annotate any removal from unit training for purposes of formal
        school attendance.
        7.6.1.4. The COT will certify that a trainee has completed IQT.
        7.6.1.5. The COT will record completion of MQT.
        7.6.1.6. The COT will record entry into CT-CMR or CT-BMC.
        7.6.1.7. The DO will identify the primary duty position of multi-qualified personnel.
        7.6.1.8. The COT will document the appointment of an individual as an instructor by
        duty position.
        7.6.1.9. Instructions for completing AF Form 4141/ Learning History within the LMS.

NOTES:
1. Entries should be in chronological order. Dates/duration indicate when the events occurred,
not the date of posting. Backlogs should be kept to a minimum.
2. Entries must match the sample. Additional operational training entries can be posted to record
significant events for which there is no sample. Do not enter events that are not operationally
related (e.g. weapons/vehicle qualification, ancillary training.)
3. Columns C, D, E and F reflect when the written and positional evaluations were performed.
4. The individual currently holding the cited position when the event occurred is the only one
who is authorized to sign for the event. A signature block is required. If the form must be re-
accomplished and the authorizing officials have departed the unit, enter the signature block and
type or print ―Signature Not Available‖ above the signature block.
5. No signature is required. However, the appropriate name of the individual must be typed in.
6. Only required for TDYs that are in excess of 7 calendar days.
7. Spot evaluations that do not affect the training status of the individual are not required.
        7.6.1.10. The COT will document the 17 month observation of an instructor during
        positional instruction to ensure certification on AF Form 4141/Learning History within
        the LMS.
        7.6.1.11. The COT will document regression to N-CMR/N-BMC status and return to
        CMR/BMC status on AF Form 4141/Learning History within the LMS.
        7.6.1.12. When the commander grants a probationary period for an individual to meet 3-
        month lookback requirements, this decision will be documented on AF Form 4141/
        Learning History within the LMS.
        7.6.1.13. Proration of requirements will be recorded on AF Form 4141/Learning History
        within the LMS, and certified by the DO.
        7.6.1.14. The COT will document specialized training/task certification (e.g. Senior
        Weapons Director, Radar Preparation Assessment Certification) to ensure certification on
        AF Form 4141/Learning History within the LMS.
     7.6.2. AF Form 4142. This form is used to document training accomplishments. The COT
     records accomplishment of academic and positional TRs and instructor or Stan/Eval-
     monitored accomplishments on AF Form 4142.
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                               53


  7.6.3. AF Form 8. This form is primarily used by Stan/Eval to record evaluations; however,
  the COT uses it to record any additional training requirements that result from evaluations.
  Therefore, any additional training that must be completed following an evaluation will be
  recorded on AF Form 8. Also, the COT will certify completion of this training on AF Form
  8.

more of the following criterion: Air Force Specialty Code, type of qualification, amount of time
the individual has been qualified, numbers of weapon system hours, and/or the number, type,
currency of missions and/or events.
Extended Training Period—Training period designed for individuals who fail to progress into
the next phase of training.
Inexperienced—- A category of crew members that do not meet the criterion required to
establish experienced status. (see experienced above).
Initial Qualification—1) A crew member engaged in training needed to qualify for basic crew

     REMOVAL OF NON-RATED CREW MEMBERS FROM TRAINING TRAINING
            EVALUATION BOARD (TEB) PROCESS/PROCEDURES

A5.1. General. The purpose of this attachment is to establish/outline specific procedures to be
taken when non-rated personnel fail to make satisfactory progress in initial qualification, mission
qualification, or continuation training. Procedures to remove a rated officer from training and/or
flying related duties/operations are outlined in AFI 11-402, Chapter 4, Flying Evaluation Boards.
This attachment only applies to non-rated personnel (officer and enlisted) assigned to a CRC or a
DRU. The complete rights of non-rated personnel are contained in this attachment.
A5.2. Policy. Per AFI 36-2626, Air Force policy is to retain and retrain only those airmen who
have demonstrated the ability to successfully complete training and whose past record clearly
justifies further training. The procedures outlined in this attachment are not meant to replace
training syllabi elimination procedures or be used in place of punitive disciplinary action, and are
not a substitute for action under the UCMJ or other administrative directives, i.e. AFI 36-2101.
A5.3. When to Convene a TEB. The unit commander may request to convene a TEB anytime
non-rated personnel fail to make satisfactory progress in IQT, MQT or CT. This decision should
be based upon an individual’s failure to attain a duty qualification, failure to requalify, or failure
to maintain proficiency levels outlined in this instruction. A TEB will be convened prior to
taking administrative actions IAW AFI 36-2101.
A5.4. TEB Convening Authority. The TEB convening authority is the organization at the
Group level or above, with the authority to direct a squadron commander to establish a TEB. The
commander/organization having a command relationship with the unit conducting the member’s
training has convening authority/jurisdiction for establishment of the TEB. The convening
authority for ACC active duty units is the 552 ACG Commander. The convening authority for
ACC gained units and for DRUs is ACC/A3Y. The convening authority for USAFE units is HQ
USAFE/A3Y.
A5.5. Appeal Authority: The appeal authority for the TEB process outlined in this attachment
is the convening authority. In cases in which the unit commander is the convening authority, the
appeal authority is the commander/organization having a command relationship with the unit
conducting the member’s training.
A5.6. Board Composition. The TEB will normally be comprised of the unit commander, DO,
and Chief of Training, but may include other members as determined by the unit commander.
The unit operations superintendent will be a board member for enlisted personnel TEBs.
A5.7. TEB Process. The Chief of Training will ensure the TEB is established, conducted, and
documented IAW this attachment. Upon approval from the convening authority, apply the
following guidelines:
     A5.7.1. The squadron commander or the training school commander initiates the TEB
     process by forwarding a TEB request to the convening authority for review/action.
     A5.7.2. The Chief of Training will ensure the following documents are compiled for the
     TEB’s review:
AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009                                                                  65


     A5.7.2.1. Complete training record to include academic and positional training
     documentation. (AF Form 8’s, AF Form 4142, etc.)
     A5.7.2.2. Training summary in chronological order.
     A5.7.2.3. Any other pertinent documentation (LOCs, TDYs, leave taken, etc.) Material
     may be collected from any source, including past assignments, to present a total profile of
     the individual.
  A5.7.3. The unit commander will appoint a board recorder. This officer or NCO is charged
  with the following duties:
     A5.7.3.1. Preparing the TEB location (pads, pencils, etc)
     A5.7.3.2. Capturing inputs, statements, and evidence presented before the board
     A5.7.3.3. Publishing minutes of the board proceedings within 2 duty days of the TEB
  A5.7.4. Board Action. NLT 15 calendar days from convening authority approval, the unit
  commander will hold the TEB. The unit commander will brief the board members on their
  responsibilities (paragraph A5.8), and will also brief the member on board proceedings,
  decisions that may be made, and his/her rights pertaining to the board (paragraph A5.9). The
  board will review and discuss, in a fair and impartial manner, all information relevant to a
  member’s training and professional qualifications. Documentation should include statements
  from evaluators, instructors and supervisor. After all evidence has been presented, the board
  will discuss and evaluate the facts. The unit commander will ultimately make one of the
  following decisions:
     A5.7.4.1. Personnel in IQT/MQT for their initial duty qualification:
         A5.7.4.1.1. Return the individual to training, providing the individual is within the
         training time limitation. If training cannot be completed as originally scheduled,
         request a Group or MAJCOM waiver to extend the training time IAW this instruction
         (if not already exhausted). Options include regressing the student to an earlier section
         of training.
         A5.7.4.1.2. Remove the member from training for failure to attain qualification in a
         crew position. This should lead to initiation of AFI 36-2101 actions.
     A5.7.4.2. Personnel in CT, IQT/MQT for an additional qualification, or requalification
     training:
         A5.7.4.2.1. Return the member to training, providing the member is within training
         time limitation. If training cannot be completed as originally scheduled, request a
         Group or MAJCOM waiver to extend the training time IAW this instruction (if not
         already exhausted). This option may include regressing the student to an earlier
         section of training.
         A5.7.4.2.2. Enter the individual into remedial training for a specific period of time.
         This option only applies to personnel in CT.
         A5.7.4.2.3. Remove the member from training and return to duty in a previously
         qualified crew position(s). The commander may elect to enter the member into
         training for another duty position.
66                                                            AFI13-1CRCV1 29 October 2009


            A5.7.4.2.4. Remove the individual from training and initiate AFI 36-2101 actions.
            This option is appropriate when the member fails to attain/maintain a qualification
            commensurate with rank/skill level. An example is a TSgt who is qualified as a
            surveillance technician but is unable to attain/maintain an advanced qualification such
            as air surveillance technician or interface control technician.
     A5.7.5. The unit commander will notify the member of his decision and follow up on the
     same day with notification in writing. The member will acknowledge receipt (not
     acceptance) of the decision by signing the IN TURN notification memo.
     A5.7.6. Upon adjournment of the TEB, the unit commander will immediately notify the
     convening authority of his decision. The convening authority reviews the TEB report before
     the member’s commander takes final action
     A5.7.7. No later than 2 duty days after receipt of the unit commander’s decision, the member
     must do one of the following:
        A5.7.7.1. Accept the decision, in which case the member will sign and date a memo
        indicating intent not to appeal the decision.
        A5.7.7.2. Decide to appeal the unit commander’s decision to the convening authority, in
        which case the member would sign and date a memo indicating intent to appeal the
        decision.
     A5.7.8. If the member decides to appeal the commander’s decision, within 3 duty days of
     notifying the commander of intent to appeal, the member will deliver a memo containing the
     rationale of the appeal to the unit commander.
     A5.7.9. The unit commander will forward the member’s appeal memo and the results of
     TEB (the IN-TURN memo and supporting documentation to include the minutes of the TEB)
     to the convening authority.
     A5.7.10. The convening authority, who is the final appeal authority, will notify the member,
     through the member’s chain-of-command, of the specific appeal decision. The unit
     commander will initiate appropriate action based on the convening authority’s decision.
A5.8. Board Member Responsibilities. Board members should review this instruction and all
evidence made available during the TEB. If statements are made by the member or witnesses,
listen and ask questions to make sure evidence is fully developed and all facts are identified.
Review the facts to arrive at findings and recommendations.
A5.9. Member’s Rights. The member for whom the TEB has been requested has the following
rights:
     A5.9.1. Be informed in writing of the specific reason(s) for convening the board
     A5.9.2. Review all evidence and documents to be submitted to the board before the board
     convenes
     A5.9.3. Be provided the opportunity to address the board (verbally or in a written statement)
     to provide personal insight into their training deficiencies
     A5.9.4. Appeal the unit commander’s decision
