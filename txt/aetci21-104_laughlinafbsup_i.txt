1. Objectives: (NOTE: When developing plans, building schedules, and reporting monthly
totals, Kirtland, Little Rock, Altus, and Fairchild AFBs will report missions. All other AETC
bases will develop plans, build schedules, and report sorties.)
     1.1. The mission is to conduct high quality student training and maintain high aircraft
     mission capability. However, staying as close to the programming factors as possible is a
     necessary part of fleet management and programmed flying training (PFT) accomplishment.
     1.2. In order to improve efficiency and accomplish the mission, consider maximizing crew
     training on all flights, plan alternate missions when possible, ensure configurations and fuel
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                       5


   loads are accurate, establish launch and recovery patterns, and utilize historical attrition data
   to the maximum extent possible.
   1.3. While it is a planning goal to zero out the annual flying hour program (FHP) by meeting
   programming factors, it is not the mission. This instruction provides the flexibility to meet
   mission objectives through effective flying and maintenance planning.
   1.4. Operational requirements are met by developing and executing plans that ensure annual
   utilization (UTE) rates are met as matched against student production requirements. Each
   wing is provided with all known factors needed to meet the required UTE rate as portrayed in
   the AETC Flying Hour Programmed Allocation (PA).
   1.5. The development of an annual wing flying plan, in monthly increments, to carry out the
   annual PA sortie, mission, or hourly requirements (the annual UTE rate) is the first step in
   the planning process. Each monthly plan is executed by weekly plans designed to meet the
   programmed monthly UTE rate.
   1.6. Due to the nontypical nature of the flying operation at the United States Air Force
   Academy (USAFA), unit maintenance and operations must develop a joint operating
   instruction (OI) that outlines the scheduling process they will follow, using AFI 21-101 and
   this instruction as a guide.
   1.7. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) The primary mission of 47 FTW/MX is to provide
   mission-ready aircraft to support planned requirements of the flying training squadrons of the
   47 OG.
2. UTE Rate Development:
   2.1. HQ AETC/A4/7 computer models will calculate the maximum sustainable UTE rate and
   allocate available aircraft within AETC to meet annual flying hour requirements. However,
   the determination of the UTE rate is a collaborative effort between HQ AETC, 19 AF, and
   each wing.
   2.2. HQ AETC/A3R will use this rate as a guide to develop the AETC PA, using the
   maximum sustainable UTE rate as an upper control limit. HQ AETC/A3RA will publish a
   PA that reflects each wing’s annual UTE rate, flying hours, and sorties or missions. The PA
   will also reflect the primary aircraft inventory (PAI) needed to fly the UTE rate and the
   average sortie duration/average mission duration (ASD/AMD) for each mission design series
   (MDS).
   2.3. For wings with the same MDS and mission, UTE rates, PAI, student load, and funding
   are allocated based on the wing’s proportional capacity.
   2.4. The      UTE        rate     models      are     located      at      the     Web      site:
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/DocMan/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-LG-
   AE-27-2-4-2-3&Filter=OO-LG-AE-27 under AETC Capabilities. These models show what
   programming factors (mission capable [MC] rate, percent of aircraft devoted to flying
   schedule, spare factor, sorties or missions per day per aircraft on the flying schedule, night or
   cross-country (XC) factor, number of operation and maintenance [O&M] days, attrition rates,
   and ASD/AMD) were used to develop the UTE rates for each weapon system.
   2.5. Units will then develop their annual month-by-month flying hour plan to execute the PA
   hours. The unit plan must be based on the annual planning factors as depicted in the PA
6                                   AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


    document. (The monthly UTE will likely vary from the published UTE that represents an
    annual average, but the annual average should match the planning UTE.) Using other factors
    could incur unintended costs. Requests for change to any of the programming factors require
    a formal request, along with factual supportable data to substantiate the request, to HQ
    AETC/A3RA with an informational copy to HQ AETC/A4MMA.
    2.6. Capability Calculations:
       2.6.1. The PA allocates a wing’s FHP for the upcoming fiscal year. With a known
       annual requirement, the next step is to communicate the wing’s capability to accomplish
       the tasking. As a minimum, capability calculations will be repeated during the
       development of monthly plans. Capability calculations determine the approximate
       maximum daily sustained sortie or mission load a unit should normally support to
       achieve a reasonable balance between training and maintenance requirements.
       2.6.2. Commanders must recognize that because these calculations are only
       approximations, their judgment must be relied on to determine if maintenance or
       operations capabilities will be exceeded. To ensure the health of the fleet, the
       maintenance group commander (MXG/CC) or Director of Maintenance (DOM) must
       ensure schedules are developed that allow sufficient time to provide for maintenance
       training and the performance of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance tasks. NOTE:
       For units without a MXG/CC responsible for maintenance, the applicable civilian director
       of maintenance (DOM) will ensure compliance with all maintenance responsibilities in
       this instruction.
    2.7. Assignment of Flying Hours and UTE Rate Requirements:
       2.7.1. HQ AETC/A3R will allocate flying hours and document annual UTE rates, PAI,
       and ASD/AMD in the PA document to match tasked production. Flying wings will
       develop and execute monthly plans to accomplish the yearly requirement based on the
       PA document. Monthly UTE rates may vary from the annual UTE rate to enable even
       sortie or mission production throughout the year despite varying O&M days, available
       daylight window, etc.
       2.7.2. Wings will ensure their annual flying hour plans are designated to achieve the
       annual UTE rate programmed by HQ AETC. UTE planning factors for each MDS are
       command averages and are provided to assist in the development of yearly and monthly
       plans as well as weekly schedules. The annual plan is an agreement between the AETC
       commander and the wing commander (WG/CC). Except for emergencies such as
       hurricane evacuations, annual flying hour allocations will not be overflown without prior
       approval of the AETC commander. NOTE: In organizations where maintenance is
       military, only PAI aircraft earn cost per flying hour (CPFH) monies and personnel.
       Backup aircraft inventory (BAI), attrition reserve, and ―excess‖ aircraft do not earn
       CPFH monies or personnel. Thus, the use of aircraft over and above authorized PAI to
       execute the annual FHP could incur unprogrammed additional costs. Contractual
       organizations determine their manpower requirements based on contract requirements.
    2.8. MAJCOM Coordination. HQ AETC/A3R is the OPR for the AETC flying hour PA.
    On the basis of the annual student production goals published in the program guidance letter
    (PGL), HQ AETC/A3R and A4M will jointly determine the annual UTE planning factors of
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                    7


   flying hours required, PAI, programmed ASD/AMD, and programmed number of sorties or
   missions for formal training units (FTU) where resources are limited. For undergraduate
   pilot training (UPT), specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT), Euro-NATO joint jet
   pilot training (ENJJPT), pilot instructor training (PIT), and introduction to fighter
   fundamental (IFF) units (organizations that have ―T‖ designated aircraft assigned), PAI is an
   output of the UTE and flying hours allocated.
   2.9. Unit or Wing Coordination. Coordination takes place at multiple levels of the
   organization through the annual, monthly, and weekly planning and scheduling processes.
   Through these processes, commanders, schedulers, and supervisors will ensure the
   distribution of sorties or missions and hours to meet training and support flying requirements
   while flying assigned aircraft at programmed UTE rates. Proper coordination is essential to
   ensure resources are available to support flying requirements and to adjust future plans.
   Units should develop a wing OI outlining local procedures for coordinating scheduling
   requirements.
3. Contracted Monthly UTE Rate:
   3.1. A monthly UTE rate is a unit’s sortie or mission or hourly requirement for a given
   month. This requirement has a two-fold purpose. First, the UTE rate will support and match
   the event calendar required to maintain the student timeline. Second, the UTE rate helps
   keep a unit within its projected maintenance and operational capability. The monthly UTE
   does not include attrition. The contracted monthly UTE rate is derived from the monthly
   portion of the wing’s annual flying plan and incorporates the wing’s programmed flying
   training, continuation training (CT), mission, and maintenance support.
   3.2. The monthly plan is an agreement between the WG/CC and wing personnel to ensure
   the annual flying hour PA and UTE rate are met. Because there is wide latitude for
   managing attrition, commanders should minimize deviating from the monthly flying contract.
   3.3. Units may reflow the monthly UTE rate during the active month to accommodate for an
   increase or decrease in requirements levied by higher headquarters or to account for
   emergencies like weather evacuations.
   3.4. Monthly planning and execution goals are defined as ―plan what to fly and fly what you
   plan.‖ Monthly plans will reflect the monthly increments in the wings annual FHP
   developed in accordance with paragraph 1.5 and maintained on file at HQ AETC/A3RA.
   There may be instances where local training or mission requirements dictate deviating from
   the monthly programmed utilization after the monthly plan is complete.
4. Maintenance Capability. Usually aircraft availability is the main element in determining
maintenance capability, but there may be times when limiting factors override aircraft
availability. For example, crew chief or technician availability or training shortfalls may limit
sortie or mission production below aircraft capability. Maintenance supervisors must inform
plans, scheduling, and documentation (PS&D) when personnel availability or capability will
affect future sortie or mission production. Similarly, the capability of the aerospace ground
equipment (AGE) activity, the amount of AGE available, and/or a shortage of spare parts may
limit maintenance capability.
5. Airframe Capability:

     5.1. The purpose of computing airframe capability is to determine how many flying hours
     and sorties or missions are supportable while maintaining both scheduled and unscheduled
     maintenance. Inspection dock capabilities must also support annual and monthly flying
     programs. When computing airframe capabilities, use only the number of PAI aircraft
     assigned. (Note: The wing aerospace vehicle distribution officer [AVDO] will notify HQ
     AETC/A4M [by MDS] when the total number of possessed aircraft in purpose identifier TF
     or ZB is less [or expected to be less] than the authorized number of PAI aircraft.) Units may
     use one of the following:
        5.1.1. The capability spreadsheet provided by the HQ AETC Analysis Section is located
        at the web address listed in para 2.4
        5.1.2. A locally developed capability spreadsheet. This spreadsheet must provide
        supervision with an accurate account of the unit’s maintenance capability to meet the
        unit’s operational requirement.
     5.2. In order to maintain a healthy fleet and develop sound flying schedules that meet the
     needs of maintenance and operations, care must be taken to ensure the correct percentage of
     MC aircraft are committed to the flying schedule. Overcommittal can be detrimental to the
     overall health of the fleet, causing a proportional decreased MC rate and a decrease in
     average fleet time. Maintenance and operations must agree to limit the percent of MC
     aircraft committed to the schedule. This number should be sufficient to meet the needs of the
     wing’s annual UTE plan without jeopardizing its maintenance capability.
     5.3. In general, it is strongly recommended that no more than 75 percent of the ―T‖
     designated MC aircraft and no more than 75 to 85 percent (depending on MDS) of fighter or
     airlift MC aircraft should be committed to the flying schedule on an annual basis. Special
     Operations Forces (SOF) aircraft with limited airframe availability may, on occasion, be
     forced to devote 90-plus percent of MC aircraft to meet flying schedule or mission
     requirements. When warranted and jointly agreed upon by the operations group commander
     (OG/CC) and maintenance group commander (MXG/CC), higher percentages may be
     committed to the schedule for limited periods of time to meet mission requirements.
     Scheduling more than the recommended percent of MC aircraft will adversely impact health
     and ultimately make the flying program tasking unexecutable.
        5.3.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Table 5.3. shows sample calculations for
        recommended maximum number of prime fliers committed to the daily schedule in order
        to meet annual health of the fleet goals. Spare aircraft are computed separately. The
        calculations in Table 5.3. serve as a guide to help achieve this goal.

   5.4. While some deviations will occur throughout the year, large deviations from the
   recommended base line percentages are not encouraged because they will significantly
   impact the ability to successfully manage the flow of aircraft into scheduled maintenance and
   the capability to fix higher than expected unscheduled breaks.
6. Scheduled Spare Concept:
   6.1. Under this concept, a percentage of first-go launches are provided as spare aircraft to
   avoid nondeliveries. Analysis will compute spare aircraft factors based on historical first
   sortie or mission logistical losses from previous or similar flying months or weeks and
   provide this information to the maintenance scheduler for use in computing spare
   requirements for future schedules. This methodology provides the minimum spare
   requirement. Actual spare requirements may be adjusted to compensate for multiple
   configurations, syllabus constraints, and maintenance capability.
   6.2. When additional spares are added for multiple configurations, units will not exceed one
   spare per configuration. Additional spares are authorized to support higher headquarters
   taskings. At least one spare aircraft is authorized per MDS for each flying day. Like
   attrition, the spare rate is a guide for planners to use in the execution of the flying schedule to
   minimize disruption. Spare configurations will be prioritized because a spare cannot
   substitute for every line on the schedule. Calculate the spare rate according to paragraph 21.
7. Year-End Closeout:
   7.1. The goal is to complete the annual FHP by flying allocated hours prior to the end of the
   fiscal year, staying as close to programmed UTE as possible without degrading mission
   accomplishment or mismanaging resources.
   7.2. WG/CCs may selectively cancel scheduled sorties or missions to manage the end-of-
   the-year flying hour closeout (the last 15 O&M days of the fiscal year). This provision will
   help wings gradually close out flying without creating ―Hangar Queens,‖ unintentionally
   exceeding the UTE rate, or accumulating unwarranted chargeable scheduling deviations.
   7.3. Sorties or missions cancelled as a result of year-end FHP accomplishment will be
   recorded as ―other cancel,‖ and will not be included in attrition computations. A unit will not
   overfly allocated hours without prior approval through HQ AETC/A3R by the AETC
   Commander.
8. Responsibilities. Any WG/CC, MXG/CC, or OG/CC responsibility identified within this
instruction may be delegated unless otherwise stated. NOTE: For civil service or contract
activities, the organizational arrangement will be in accordance with their applicable statement of
work.
   8.1. WG/CC. The WG/CC is responsible for UTE rate management. He or she will
   approve and forward the wing’s annual UTE plan and/or any monthly reprograms of the
   approved annual flying plan to HQ AETC/A3, HQ AETC/A3RA, HQ AETC/A4MMA, and
   19 AF/DO. The wing commander will also approve monthly flying plans and weekly
   utilization and maintenance schedules. NOTE: For the 479 FTG, 336 TRG, 306 FTG and
   80 FTW, the OG/CC may approve plans and schedules for the WG/CC.
   8.2. MXG/CC. The MXG/CC (or equivalent) will support the primary mission with
   materiel, maintenance, and management functions. He or she will ensure realistic schedules
10                               AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


  are developed that meet the training objectives without jeopardizing the health of the fleet.
  The MXG/CC will recommend approval of maintenance plans and schedules for presentation
  to the WG/CC.
  8.3. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). The MOC will review the on-line IMDS
  debriefed sortie recap, screen 174, and the IMDS background products daily Accomplishment
  Utilization Report (Screen 362), Deviation Detail Listing (Screen 181), Deviation Summary
  Inquiry (Screen 173) and Uncompleted Operational Events (Screen719), to ensure accuracy
  of deviation reporting. The MOC will also review Uncompleted Operational Events, IMDS
  screen 719, daily to ensure uncompleted sortie lines are deleted using Operational Events
  Delete IMDS screen 883, if necessary after coordination with debrief section and MOF
  PS&D. The MOC will record additions, cancellations before crew show, Tail Swaps and
  spare usage in IMDS as they occur (AFI 21-101/AETC Sup 1 and this instruction).
  Deviation reporting (AETCI 21-105, Logistics Performance Measures Reporting
  Procedures) provides an audit trail to identify variations to the printed schedule for analysis
  and scheduling sections.
  8.4. Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF) Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation
  (PS&D). This organization will:
     8.4.1. Coordinate the integration of maintenance schedules and operational plans into a
     wing plan according to AFI 21-101 and its AETC Sup 1.
     8.4.2. Perform the AVDO function and verify UTE program data reports for accuracy
     according to AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting, AFI
     21-101, and AETC Sups 1 thereto.
     8.4.3. Be the wing’s single point of contact for aircraft UTE reporting. Coordinate with
     operations scheduling not later than the second workday of the month to ensure data
     entered into the Integrated Maintenance Data System-Central Data Base (IMDS-
     CDB)/GO81 matches between maintenance and operations scheduling. Coordinate any
     corrections or changes to data with all applicable agencies.
     8.4.3. (LAUGHLINAFB) Flying Time Accounting for Debrief and SARMS. To
     ensure timely and accurate flight hour and sortie accounting data, the Flying Training
     Squadrons’ (FTS) Squadron Aviation Resource Management Specialists (SARMS) shall
     work closely with PS&D and debriefing personnel to verify sortie data daily.
         8.4.3.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) FTS will forward all AFTO Forms 781, Arms
         Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, to Debriefing after each sortie in the most
         expeditious manner available. Currently printing to mapped printers in the debriefing
         sections is the preferred method.
             8.4.3.1.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) AFTO Forms 781 are input into
             Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) as received. If Debriefing identifies
             any AFTO Form 781 errors, Debrief will contact the squadron SARM to ensure
             AFTO Form 781 corrections are made by the Pilot in Command as soon as
             possible, but no later than step time of the next sortie of the affected aircraft.
             8.4.3.1.2. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Debrief will compare all AFTO Forms
             781 received against the flying schedules to ensure all are received. After all
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                              11


          AFTO Forms 781 have been entered into IMDS, Debrief will fill out MX Form 3,
          MX Debriefing AFTO 781 Status Report, indicating missing or incomplete
          sorties.
          8.4.3.1.3. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) After the last sortie of the day has been
          flown, Debriefing will forward all AFTO Forms 781 and MX Form 3 to PS&D
          where final accounting of sorties and hours begins. Missing sorties will be logged
          on the appropriate MDS tab of the Daily MX/OPS Sortie Recap spreadsheet.
          PS&D will run the Daily Accomplishment and Utilization Report (AUR), and
          send appropriate copies to FTS along with AFTO Forms 781 and copies of the
          MX Form 3.
          8.4.3.1.4. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) AFTO Forms 781 are checked by
          SARMS for the proper sortie duration, mission symbol, and other required
          information. SARMS shall verify AFTO Forms 781 against the daily AUR and
          make corrections in red ink on the AUR.
             8.4.3.1.4.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) When AFTO Forms 781 are missing
             from the AUR, SARMs shall relay missing information in the most
             expeditious manner possible to PS&D or to Debriefing after normal duty
             hours. This information will also be annotated on AUR with all info
             necessary for IMDS input. This is done to prevent overflying aircraft
             inspections.
          8.4.3.1.5. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) If not received the evening prior, PS&D
          will pick up a corrected copy of the previous day’s AUR with corrections as they
          deliver the newest AUR to SARMs.
          8.4.3.1.6. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) All sortie data for the month must be
          processed and corrected before the third (3rd) day of the following month. Sorties
          or corrections made after the midnight on the fourth (4th) day of the following
          month show as late sorties in the current Monthly AUR.
       8.4.3.2. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Debriefing shall:
          8.4.3.2.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Ensure all AFTO Forms 781 are
          accounted for by verifying them against the daily flying schedule with updates
          from MOC.
          8.4.3.2.2. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Update flying hour accounting system in
          the IMDS IAW AFCSM 21-565 V2.
          8.4.3.2.3. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Deliver all AFTO Forms 781, including
          those received on Sunday for Cross Country (XC) returns to PS&D by close of
          business on the date flown to ensure early morning processing the following day.
          Notify PS&D of any unaccounted AFTO Forms 781 through use of MX Form 3.
       8.4.3.3. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) PS&D’s Flying Hour Monitor shall:
          8.4.3.3.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Run AUR daily.
          8.4.3.3.2. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Use AFTO Form 781H to verify the daily
          AUR for accuracy.
12                               AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


             8.4.3.3.3. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Ensure delivery of AFTO Forms 781 and
             copies of AUR to SARMS daily.

             the first working day of each week.
             8.4.3.3.6. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Reverify monthly AUR after corrections
             and input into IMDS prior to 2400 on the fourth (4th) day of the following month.
             8.4.3.3.7. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Submit a daily e-mail with each day’s
             hours and sorties flown to Wing Programming and FTS NLT 1100. Submit a
             weekly e-mail with each week’s hours and sorties flown to Wing Programming by
             1100 every Tuesday.
             8.4.3.3.8. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Submit a monthly e-mail with the final
             monthly AUR and final hours and sorties flown during the previous month to
             Wing Programming (AVUM) and PS&D Supervisor (AVDO) as soon as the
             hours have been finalized by each flying squadron SARMS
         8.4.3.4. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Squadron SARMS shall:
             8.4.3.4.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Submit an email to the Wing
             Programming office and PS&D Supervisor when their squadron hours and sorties
             have been finalized at the end of each month.
         8.4.3.5. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) AVUM shall:
             8.4.3.5.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Send the monthly message to appropriate
             agencies IAW AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilizations
             Reporting.
  8.4.4. In accordance with the requirements in AFI 21-101 (and its AETC Sup 1) and in
  coordination with the OG, develop written guidance that standardizes scheduling practices
  including standardized flying windows, specific surge rules, quiet hour policies, XC takeoffs
  and returns, minimum turn times, crew-ready times, and daily verification of the previous
  day’s flying hours between maintenance and operations.
         8.4.4.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) The maximum sustainable flying hour window
         for MX is 14 hours. Exceeding this flying hour window may affect the next day’s
         prime flier availability.
     8.4.5. Combine aircraft capability provided by analysis with availability factors to
     support operational requirements for the development of annual, quarterly, monthly, and
     weekly plans.
     8.4.6. Integrate maintenance and operational requirements into realistic plans and
     schedules, maintaining a balance of UTE rate accomplishment, student training timeline,
     fleet time standards, and scheduled maintenance requirements. These plans will include
     the annual projection capability, quarterly maintenance plans, and monthly and weekly
     schedules. A file copy of fiscal year annual projections will be maintained according to
     the Air Force RDS.
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                  13


     8.4.7. Load weekly operational schedules into the maintenance information system
     (MIS) when approved to make status and deviation reporting easier, more accurate, and
     nearer to real time. During MIS system failure, complete the first five blocks on AETC
     IMT 206C, Aircraft Deviation Record, and distribute it to the MOC. See Attachment 2
     for instructions on completing AETC IMT 206C, All units will load flying schedules
     into the MIS by 1500 on Friday of the week preceding the effective week or prior to the
     daily scheduling meeting for the next day.
     8.4.8. In conjunction with maintenance management analysis (MMA), provide
     maintenance capability computations to operations prior to the programmed flying
     training (PFT) conference (not applicable to ―T‖ designated aircraft).
  8.5. Maintenance Management Analysis (MMA). This office will:
     8.5.1. Review sortie or mission scheduling effectiveness and flying deviations for trends.
  8.5.2. Analyze and identify the cause of trends; for example, equipment performance and
  scheduling problems.
     8.5.3. Inform the operations squadron (OS) scheduling and maintenance PS&D of
     schedule deviations and make recommendations based on the data extracted from the
     MIS, AETC IMT 206C, or AF IMT 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule
     Coordination.
     8.5.4. Compute and develop logistics attrition factors by month for the year (recorded
     from the printed weekly schedules) and provide these historical annual attrition factors to
     maintenance PS&D and operations scheduling prior to the start of the annual planning
     process. Historical attrition encompasses a minimum of 5 years of previous data for the
     month being planned. For example, attrition factors for January 2011 include actual
     attrition experienced in January of 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Historical attrition
     is divided by a percent in each of the following categories: weather, maintenance,
     supply, operations, other, and a total. Refer to AETCI 21-105 for determining attrition
     factors and reporting procedures. (NOTE: Units with new aircraft will use attrition
     factors from the most comparable aircraft in their unit’s inventory for a minimum of 2
     years to formulate baseline attrition data for the new aircraft.)
     8.5.5. Compute spare aircraft requirements annually.
  8.6. Flight Line Production Superintendent. This flight line production superintendent
  will:
     8.6.1. Direct the maintenance effort in implementing the approved weekly utilization and
     maintenance schedule. Coordinate with operations scheduling (through PS&D) on partial
     mission capable (PMC) or restricted aircraft (AFI 21-103).
     8.6.2. Coordinate with PS&D on not mission capable (NMC) aircraft scheduled to fly on
     the following day so a replacement aircraft may be selected prior to the daily scheduling
     meeting.
     8.6.3. Update the MOC on any aircraft discrepancy that affects NMC or PMC status.
     8.6.4. Coordinate tail number changes (interchanges and spares) to scheduled sortie or
     mission lines with maintenance PS&D and operations scheduling.
14                               AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


     8.6.5. Assess the suitability of aircraft with repeat, recur, and cannot duplicate (CND)
     discrepancies for continued flight.
     8.6.6. Keep the MOC informed of any schedule changes for deviation recording.
  8.7. OG/CC. The OG/CC is responsible for student training. He or she will ensure realistic
  schedules are developed and executed to meet student training objectives. The OG/CC will
  recommend approval of squadron flying plans and schedules for presentation to the WG/CC.
  8.8. Operations Squadron (OS). For UPT, SUPT, JUPT, ENJJPT, PIT and IFF units, the
  OS will ensure aircrew members debrief sorties flown, using the correct sortie line number in
  accordance with paragraph 13.8 of this instruction.
     8.8.1. The OS commander will ensure realistic schedules are developed and meet
     training objectives without jeopardizing fleet health.
     8.8.2. Operations capability may be a limiting factor when computing scheduling
     requirements. Operations capability is the maximum number of sorties or missions that
     can be generated with available aircrew instructors (AI), students, and other qualified
     crew members in the number of hours for a given daily flying window, consistent with
     syllabus constraints.
     8.8.3. Individual flights and OSs will determine their maximum capabilities, which are
     then compared to current and desired event line positions and converted into a UTE rate.
     If maintenance limitations exist in achieving sorties, missions, UTE rates, or hourly
     requirements, but a resolution is not possible at the squadron level, the group commander
     will be consulted for resolution. When operational limitations exist, individual flights
     and OSs will consider management actions such as increasing the number of daily sorties
     or missions for each aircrew member, flying on weekends, delaying support flying,
     and/or increasing the number of prime fliers. However, they will ensure these actions
     stay within the capability of maintenance.
     8.8.4. The syllabus of instruction provides        course/lesson guidance and places
     sortie/mission requirements on each student.      When computing a realistic student
     capability limitation, factors such as phase of   training, simulator training, duty not
     involving flying (DNIF) periods, and duration     of maximum effort will be carefully
     considered.
     8.8.5. Individual OSs will determine their maximum AI capability by considering
     simulator missions, flight duties, DNIF periods, leaves, required meetings, training,
     training review boards, student continuity, etc. Attached AIs will be considered when
     estimating maximum AI capability.
  8.9. OSS Operations Scheduling. OSS Operations Scheduling will:
     8.9.1. Obtain range, airspace, tanker support, and/or flying commitments.
     8.9.2. Coordinate (to include confirmation) on all military training routes. (A locally
     designated representative may be outside this function.)
     8.9.3. Manage air refueling tracks and finalize air refueling requirements per AFI 11-
     221, Air Refueling Management (KC-10 and KC-135).
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                     15


       8.9.4. Receive intercommand and intracommand tasking (airlift channel missions) and
       disseminate the tasking to OSs.
       8.9.5. Monitor (by MDS) the wing’s progress toward planned monthly and annual UTE
       rates and FHP attainment.
       8.9.6. Ensure the wing’s annual flying hour plan is developed with assistance from
       maintenance scheduling.
   8.10. Flying Squadron Operations Officer. The squadron operations officer will:
       8.10.1. Consolidate OSS operations scheduling of student and instructor flying
       requirements into flying plans and schedules to include annual projections, monthly
       plans, and weekly schedules. Negotiate and coordinate flying requirements with the
       appropriate maintenance PS&D section.
       8.10.2. Notify PS&D once the PFT conference date is known (not required for ―T‖
       designated aircraft).
       8.10.3. Monitor the flying schedule and ensure sorties or missions that did not meet
       operational objectives (for example, incomplete checkrides) are scheduled to be reflown.
       8.10.4. Compute operations attrition factors used to develop the PFT plan.
       8.10.5. Assess the suitability of a PMC or restricted aircraft to complete sortie or mission
       objectives.
9. First-Look Requirements. In order to ensure each unit has airframe capability to support
flying hour requirements and determine if any capability shortfalls exist, each unit will conduct
an airframe capability assessment. MMA will review the unit’s historical data and provide
specific capabilities to PS&D no later than 45 days prior to the annual PFT conference (if one is
held for the unit’s assigned MDS). There is no PFT conference for ―T‖ designated aircraft but
all unit’s MMA sections must provide historical data to PS&D in order to begin the development
of future plans. Conducting a detailed first-look requirement will establish a solid foundation for
all other plans and schedules the wing is required to build. First look requirements are outlined
in AFI 21-101 and will be accomplished annually prior to the PFT conference.
10. Annual Plan. The AETC PA, the basis for executing the annual plan, will be distributed to
flying units no later than 30 August. The wing will develop an annual plan to accomplish the
annual UTE rate, annual FHP, and student production requirements. Additional annual planning
guidance is outlined in AFI 21-101.
   10.1. PS&D and operations scheduling will identify any limiting factors in support of the
   annual flying hour plan to the WG/CC (jointly through operations and maintenance
   supervisors) and ensure the annual projection is coordinated with all affected activities; for
   example, engine management. In addition to the information listed in the PA, the following
   factors will be used (as applicable) when developing the annual plan: (NOTE: This data
   will be maintained on file for a minimum of 1 year by both maintenance and operations.)
       10.1.1. Number of O&M days. Identify holidays, exercises, and other no-fly days.
       10.1.2. Monthly historical attrition.
 16                               AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


      10.1.3. Annual scheduled sorties or missions to include projected known functional
      check flights (FCF), operational check flights (OCF), and ferry sorties or missions.
      10.1.4. Sorties or missions and hours required for deployments.
      10.1.5. Average scheduled sorties or missions required per O&M day.
      10.1.6. Daily flying schedule block patterns.
      10.1.7. Available daylight hours.
      10.1.8. Anticipated aircraft gains and transfers.
      10.1.9. Projected number of students.
      10.1.10. Estimated munitions usage.
      10.1.11. Support sorties or missions.
      10.1.12. Maintenance manning levels.
      10.1.13. Instructor pilot (IP) and programmed student levels.
      10.1.14. Monthly inspection dock requirements as a result of monthly flying projections.
   10.2. When the annual plan is completed, forward one copy each to HQ AETC/A3, HQ
   AETC/A3RA, HQ AETC/A4/7, HQ AETC/A4MMA, and 19 AF/DO by the 10th calendar
   day of September. Use the format at Attachment 3 when forwarding annual flying plans and
   reflows of flying programs. The annual plan must reflect the monthly PAI, sortie or mission
   or hourly requirement, UTE rate, and ASD/AMD. Total annual hours and sorties or missions
   for each MDS must match the PA document. In addition to, and separate from the plan for
   executing the PA allocation, identify any flying hour disconnects (shortfall or excess) that
   could impact student production for the affected fiscal year. To the extent resources permit,
   HQ AETC/A3R will work to resolve these disconnects prior to the first scheduled
   adjustment.
   10.3. When HQ AETC changes planned requirements as reflected in the PA, reflow the
   unflown portion of the annual plan for the remaining months (Attachment 3). Changes in the
   PA may change the PAI, ASD/AMD, or UTE rate for the remainder of the fiscal year.
   10.4. OSS operations scheduling will track the execution of the annual flying plan. When
   there is a delta below or above the annual plan, consider reflowing any changes over the
   remaining months.
11. Quarterly Plan:
   11.1. The quarterly plan (sometimes referred to as a long-range plan) is a refinement of the
   annual plan (paragraph 10). It establishes a sound basis for the remaining phases of the
   scheduling process. The intent is to develop the plan in such a way that it is accessible by
   maintenance and operations at all times.
   11.2. Long-range maintenance plans will be developed in as much detail as possible. All
   maintenance requirements will be consolidated into a single long-range plan using AF Form
   2401, Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, computer generated or locally
   developed form. As a minimum, the long-range plan shows the current month and the next 2
   months’ known flying and maintenance requirements. Known maintenance requirements are
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                     17


   defined as any maintenance event that impacts aircraft availability and maintenance events
   requiring management attention to ensure smooth flow of scheduling/completion.
   Maintenance events should be consolidated during a single down period to the greatest
   extent possible. As a minimum, include calendar inspections that prevent operational
   utilization for that day(s) flying schedule, calendar time change items, TCTOs in workable
   status, PDM schedules, training aircraft, cannibalization aircraft, and aircraft ISO/PE/Phase
   inspections. Specific locally developed codes will be used to identify each different special
   inspection, TCI, and TCTO on the AF Form 2401. Other maintenance requirements, such as
   engine changes, hourly requirements, inspections, training aircraft and cannibalization
   aircraft will be posted as they become known or planned.
   11.3. Periodic adjustments will be made to ensure the most economical use of resources,
   while ensuring supportability of the operational requirement.
   11.4. A proactive quarterly plan will result in the development of an accurate and useful
   monthly plan (paragraph 12).
12. Monthly Plan: (NOTE: The WG/CC may direct other items to be added.)
   12.1. Monthly aircraft maintenance and utilization planning is a continuation and refinement
   of the quarterly plan, based on the current annual plan, that includes the addition of aircraft
   sorties or missions identified on AETC IMT 206, Monthly Flying Coordination or locally
   approved product. (NOTE: This document will not be considered as government direction
   to change the contract unless specifically authorized by the contracting officer. If the
   contractor believes this is outside the scope of the contract, he or she will take no action and
   will promptly notify the contracting officer.) See Attachment 4 for instructions on
   completing AETC IMT 206.
   12.2. Document all known monthly utilization and maintenance requirements on a locally
   approved product or Air Force form or IMT such as AF IMT 3153, General Purpose (11 x 8
   1/2”), or AF Form 2401, Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedules.
   12.3. In-shop maintenance requirements will also be published in this plan. Completing the
   AETC IMT 520, Engine Maintenance and Inspection Forecast, fulfills the engine
   requirements.
   12.4. Conduct initial planning for the monthly flying plan during the first work week of the
   preceding month. The tentative flying plan must provide as much detail as possible and is
   designed (based on student availability) to ensure annual UTE, monthly UTE, and STL
   requirements are met. As a minimum, the plan will include both the required and scheduled
   number of daily sorties or missions and launch blocks along with munitions and
   configuration requirements. Other impacting events such as safety briefings, commander’s
   calls, scheduled exercises, and TDYs will also be included.
   12.5. If AETC IMT 206 is not used, units will include the following information in their
   monthly plan:
      12.5.1. Annual UTE position data compared to the wing’s current annual plan
      (Attachment 3).
      12.5.2. Student timeline position, current and projected.
      12.5.3. Percentage of attrition by category.
18                                AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


     12.5.4. Total sorties or missions and hours required as listed in wing’s annual plan
     (Attachment 3).
     12.5.5. Total sorties or missions and hours scheduled.
     12.5.6. Number of aircraft required to support the schedule.
     12.5.7. Anticipated configurations in accordance with syllabus requirements.
  12.6. The foundation of the monthly plan is the total required sorties or missions (or hours)
  needed to meet training requirements that support student event timeline progression, CT,
  and mission and maintenance support. Required sorties or missions are further refined by
  using the various training management systems to distribute student and support sorties or
  missions. Adjust requirements to achieve the best use of resources. When using an hourly
  plan, divide required hours into a specific number of sorties or missions, but make
  adjustments to achieve the hourly requirement.
  12.7. Monthly attrition sorties or missions (or hours) are added to the monthly requirement.
  Attrition sorties or missions or hours are expected losses to the weekly schedule. Apply
  attrition factors to required locally supported sorties or missions. Units may apply attrition to
  deployed launched sorties or missions. Do not apply attrition to off-station sorties or
  missions, ferry flights, FCFs, or OCFs.
  12.8. Squadron operations scheduling and PS&D may apply monthly attrition factors to
  student or instructor requirements based on the expected environment for the coming month
  (Attachment 4). Attrition sorties or missions (or hours) are not substitutes for capability
  shortfalls; they are figured against the operational requirements. The monthly plan will
  reflect the number of sorties, missions, or hours required; attrition sorties, missions, or hours
  added; and number of sorties, missions, or hours scheduled for each unit.
  12.9. The formula for determining monthly requirements to schedule is the number of sorties
  or missions (or hours) required divided by 1 minus the attrition factor; for example, 1000/ (1-
  .15) = 1177 sorties or missions to schedule. For sorties or missions, round up any part to the
  next whole number.
  12.10. Along with the following information on the AETC IMT 206 or locally approved
  product, squadron operations scheduling will apply the attrition factor supplied by
  maintenance analysis for each month and compute the total number of sorties, missions, or
  hours that must be scheduled to meet the requirement.
     12.10.1. Type of sorties or missions.
     12.10.2. Number of sorties or missions and hours.
     12.10.3. Anticipated munitions, photo, electronic countermeasure configurations, and
     estimated munitions expenditures or ammunition changes.
  12.11. Squadron operations scheduling will forward a copy of the completed document to
  PS&D.
  12.12. After coordinating any necessary adjustments with maintenance and operations
  scheduling, OS commanders will document training requirements and maintenance capability
  and then forward requests to OSS operations scheduling.
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                   19


  12.13. The monthly flying and maintenance plan will be finalized during the third weekly
  scheduling meeting of the preceding month. At this meeting, the MXG/CC and OG/CC will
  outline past accomplishments, the degree to which mission goals are being met, problems
  being encountered, projected number of prime fliers along with spare availability, and current
  and projected fleet times. They will review the request for the coming month.
  12.14. When planned students do not show or when a lack of projected capability or
  resource funding prevents meeting monthly UTE rates, the WG/CC will decide what portions
  of the plan will be supported and to what degree. In this case, maintenance and operations
  scheduling will reflow the annual plan and identify flying hours for possible turn-in or
  additional hours required.
  12.15. If the projected number of available aircraft is less than required to accomplish the
  requirement, the OG/CC will provide alternatives and limitations to the WG/CC. If logistics
  support is limited, the MXG/CC will provide alternatives. The WG/CC will validate these
  requirements and decide to what degree support will be given. Once signed by the WG/CC,
  OG/CC, and MXG/CC, the monthly plan establishes the foundation for the development of
  weekly schedules.
  12.16. During the execution year, the actual hours flown may cause deviations from the
  original annual plan. In order to account for these deltas, it may become necessary to
  ―reflow‖ the hours by creating a new flying hour plan. The reflowed plan will communicate
  how the remaining hours will be flowed into the months remaining in the fiscal year,
  accounting for fleet health and operational capabilities agreed upon by both maintenance and
  operations.
  12.17. A reflow should be considered when the delta is so large it exceeds the capabilities of
  maintenance and operations in a single month (normally the monthly plan). Reflows are
  approved at the wing level with both operations and maintenance developing and agreeing to
  an effective and attainable FHP to execute.
  12.18. The WG/CC will forward a copy of the change to the annual plan (Attachment 3) to
  HQ AETC/A3, HQ AETC/A3RA, HQ AETC/A4/7, HQ AETC/A4MMA, and 19 AF/DO, by
  the 10th calendar day of the affected month. (NOTE: This is administrative processing time
  only and does not imply that a unit will delay formulating a plan until the 10th of the month.)
  Some reflows artificially conceal accumulating deviations. Therefore, reflows that do not
  change the annual allocation (adjustments) may or may not be applied to the flying hour
  execution model. Reflows will reflect the wing’s plan to get back on track with the FHP.
  12.19. After the proposed monthly plan has been signed, PS&D will publish and distribute
  it. This may be accomplished electronically no later than 5 duty days prior to the end of the
  month (Figure 1), or the plan may be included as an annex to the last weekly schedule of the
  preceding month. NOTE: Figure 1 shows a sample calendar for planning and scheduling of
  monthly meetings.
  12.20. The calendar in Figure 1 shows a sample month. It represents when group- and wing-
  level quarterly, monthly, and weekly scheduling meetings should be conducted and when
  maintenance and operations requirements must be met. Each unit may hold scheduling
  meetings at times during the week or month convenient to its organization, as long as the
  timelines in this instruction are met.

   12.21. For FHP adjustments, as the PA is executed during the fiscal year, units may find
   their requirement no longer matches their allocated program. This may be due to student no
   shows, force sustainment changes, and/or force structure issues. Wings should reevaluate
   their FHPs to ensure excess hours are turned back in to the AETC Flying Hour Manager.
   These hours will be evaluated for possible redistribution to fulfill other valid flying training
   requirements. Wings will submit FHP adjustments to HQ AETC/A3RA who will coordinate
   adjustment requests with HQ AETC/A4M, HQ AETC/A4P, HQ AETC/FM, and 19 AF/DO.
   In some circumstances, units may request an unscheduled special adjustment. These requests
   should be rare and limited to situations beyond the unit’s control. There are three scheduled
   adjustments: January, April, and August, as follows:
      12.21.1. Operations, with coordination through maintenance, will request adjustments by
      the 10th calendar day of January, April, and August. Requests are due on the preceding
      Friday if the 10th falls on a weekend. Late requests will not be processed until the next
      scheduled adjustment. A detailed explanation for the request will be provided to include
      numbers that support the request (attrition, quota cancellations, ineffective sorties or
      missions, etc). If justification is not provided, an adjustment may not be granted.
      12.21.2. Units may be notified by message of approval or disapproval, usually within 3
      weeks of the request suspense. Once approval has been granted, units will provide HQ
      AETC/A3RA their programmed reflow (Attachment 3). The approval authority is HQ
      AETC/A3R.
   12.22. A proactive monthly plan will result in the development of an accurate and useful
   weekly schedule.
13. Weekly Schedule:
   13.1. Weekly planning verifies progression towards the monthly plan and is a refinement of
   the monthly plan. Use a monthly plan as a guide for building a weekly schedule. Make
   adjustments to the monthly plan, as required, to accommodate unforeseen maintenance or
   operations problems, higher or lower than forecasted attrition, uncompleted maintenance
   actions, and short notice requirements.
   13.2. Maintenance and operations schedulers must coordinate regularly when developing the
   weekly schedule to ensure all essential utilization and maintenance requirements are
   supportable. The planning week is 0001 local time Monday through 2400 local time Sunday.
   Once the weekly schedule is signed by the WG/CC, it executes the monthly plan and
   becomes the basis for deviation reporting. NOTE: Weekly planning and deviation
   accounting also applies to deployed units if they have parent maintenance support and are
   flying hours from the AETC PA.

  13.3. The first duty day of the week, PS&D will verify and send operations scheduling any
  known special maintenance requirements for the following week, such as flight compass
  swings or FCFs required by the aircraft -6 TO.
  13.4. Operations scheduling will refine the weekly portion of the monthly plan for the week
  being developed and forward all required information to PS&D no later than two duty days
  before the weekly scheduling meeting. Extract requirements listed in paragraph 12.10 and
  each day’s flying schedule by sortie or mission for the week being planned to include:
     13.4.1. Date.
     13.4.2. Type mission.
     13.4.3. Required and attrition sorties or missions.
     13.4.4. All takeoff and land times. Units that fly a published and constant ASD/AMD
     may refrain from publishing land times. Takeoff times must be coordinated and agreed
     to by both maintenance and operations.
     13.4.5. Configuration and munitions requirements.
  13.5. Operations scheduling may use AETC IMT 206A, Weekly Flying Coordination, to
  develop sortie or mission requirements. (NOTE: This document will not be considered as
  government direction to change the contract unless specifically authorized by the contracting
  officer. If the contractor believes this is outside the scope of the contract, he or she will take
  no action and will promptly notify the contracting officer.) See Attachment 5 for instructions
  on completing AETC IMT 206A. The daily operational portion of the weekly schedule will
  be printed and contain, as a minimum, the information in paragraph 13.4. Schedulers may
  use AETC IMT 208, Weekly Scheduling Request, to consolidate flight requests.
     13.5.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) The draft Weekly Schedule (206A and associated
     daily plans) will be sent through email to the applicable aircraft scheduler, the PS&D
     work leader, and PS&D Supervisor by noon on the Friday prior to the scheduling
     meeting. A hard copy 206A will be presented to Wing Programming at the programming
     meeting on Tuesday and any known issues will be discussed at this time. Any
     outstanding issues from this meeting are resolved prior to 1000 on Wednesday to allow
     Wing Programming time to prepare packages, including the final AFTO Forms 206A for
     signing at the OG/MX scheduling meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Pen and ink
     changes may be made at this meeting, but any changes following this meeting will
     require an AFTO IMT 2407. PS&D will incorporate the pen and ink changes and finalize
     the entire Weekly MX and OPS Plan for presentation to the DOM, OG/CC, and WG/CC
     on Thursday afternoon. The plan will be forwarded and approved electronically. The
     copy approved by the WG/CC will be returned to PS&D for filing.
     13.5.2. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) During night flying weeks, flying and maintenance
     schedules are planned and shifted to facilitate night flying operations. OPS will inform
     MX of deviations to the published night flying schedule on the OG Strategic Calendar, as
     soon as possible, but not less than ten (10) days prior to the proposed shifting of night
     flying weeks. Any deviations to this policy must be approved by the OG/CC and DOM.
     13.5.3. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Quiet Periods, Sterile Periods, Graduation Retreats,
     and flybys will be conducted in accordance with LAFBI 13-203, Airfield Operations.
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                    23


     These events will be coordinated and identified in the remarks area of the Weekly Flying
     Contract. PS&D schedulers will notify maintenance work centers through the Daily Info
     slides located in the Maintenance shared drive’s Daily Slides folder. The Control Tower
     will notify the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) who then notifies all maintenance
     work centers, Transient Alert (TA), Petroleum, Oil, Lubricant (POL), and 47 MSG/LGRS
     (Supply) when the period begins and ends.
  13.6. In the weekly schedule, PS&D will identify and assign aircraft tail numbers to each
  line number based on aircraft capability, status, and configuration. Schedules should be
  developed in descending order (for example, 25X25X15X10). However, there may be times
  when developing schedules in descending order is not feasible or practical. PS&D will
  consolidate and review the schedules for adequate utilization of aircraft and proper
  scheduling of maintenance requirements prior to submission to the WG/CC. In addition to
  the requirements published in AFI 21-101, PS&D will include the following in the weekly
  schedule:
     13.6.1. Scheduled utilization and maintenance actions by aircraft and equipment serial
     number to include aircraft specific -6 TO scheduled and special calendar and hourly
     requirements.
     13.6.2. Estimated requirements for petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), when required,
     to include number of trucks, refueling pits, and times required.
     13.6.3. Aircraft and equipment to support ground training requirements.
  13.7. UPT, SUPT, ENJJPT, PIT and IFF units (in organizations with T-1, T-6, and T-38,
  aircraft assigned) may abstain from assigning aircraft tail numbers to specific line numbers
  on the daily operational portion of the weekly schedule. PS&D must identify prime and
  spare aircraft and how many sorties are planned for each prime aircraft.
  13.8. Units will develop a locally approved IMT or spreadsheet that depicts at a glance the
  maintenance and operational utilization of all aircraft for the week scheduled. This IMT or
  spreadsheet will contain all aircraft tail numbers assigned and identify prime fliers (including
  number of sorties or missions planned; for example F4 on the spreadsheet will denote four
  sorties or missions are scheduled for a particular aircraft) and spare aircraft. It will also
  identify maintenance and training requirements. Match tail numbers from the weekly
  utilization schedule to the specific line number prior to the daily scheduling meeting. These
  programmed prime fliers, along with spare aircraft, are the available pool to fly the daily
  schedule.
  13.9. Regardless of the type of unit (military, civil service, or contractor), aircraft will be
  scheduled into a specific line number. For continuity purposes and to aid in the analytical
  process, the sortie or mission will be debriefed in the MIS, using the same line number
  published in the weekly schedule. UPT, SUPT, ENJJPT, PIT, and IFF units will use the
  following standardized sortie line numbers: (NOTE: All other AETC units should develop
  written guidance standardizing their sortie line numbers. Wings with one MDS in multiple
  flying units should divide these line numbers equitably between the units.)
     13.9.1. Local sorties: 001-298.
     13.9.2. Additions: 300-598.
24                               AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


     13.9.3. Return from O&B, off-station, and XC sorties: 600-698.
     13.9.4. FCF and OCF: 700-728.
     13.9.5. Ferry Sorties: 730-748.
     13.9.6. HQ AETC taskings: 750-798.
     13.9.7. Weather evacuations: 800-898.
  13.10. When monthly actual attrition is greater or less than programmed, prudently adjust
  weekly flying schedules to stay on track with the monthly and annual UTE rate. The intent
  of adjusting weekly schedules in order to meet the programmed UTE rate is to keep PFT and
  the FHP properly aligned and for fleet management. However, zeroing out the monthly UTE
  is not expected. Implement a prorated system for weather cancellation during the weekly
  process and recording deviations. (See Attachment 4 and Attachment 2 for instructions on
  completing AETC IMT 206A and AETC IMT 206C, respectively.) Distribute the
  adjustments over future weekly flying plans to avoid significant disruptions to scheduled
  maintenance plans and student syllabus requirements. Make every effort to meet student and
  CT training requirements. Attrition sorties are expendable. The following are examples for
  adjusting attrition:
     13.10.1. Low Attrition Application. If losses do not occur as anticipated, adjust weekly
     schedules to prevent exceeding the monthly plan. For example, if the monthly plan is
     2,102 sorties or missions with an attrition factor of 25 percent, a total of 2,803 sorties or
     missions would be scheduled at 127.4 sorties or missions per day for the 22-workday
     month of June. During 1 through 16 June (12 workdays), 1,400 of 1,402 sorties or
     missions scheduled were flown. The third weekly sortie or mission request should then
     be adjusted to prevent an overfly. Subtract the 1,400 sorties or missions flown from the
     2,102 monthly requirement. This leaves a commitment of 702 required sorties or
     missions. Using the same 25 percent attrition factor, only 936 sorties or missions must be
     scheduled for the remaining 2 weeks. Depending on actual losses during the third week,
     a further increase or decrease for the fourth week may be required.
     13.10.2. High Attrition Application. During the same 12-day period, 1,000 of 1,402
     sorties or missions scheduled were flown due to higher than planned weather losses.
     Therefore, the third weekly sortie or mission request should be adjusted to prevent an
     underfly of the monthly plan. Subtract the 1,000 sorties or missions flown from the 2,102
     monthly requirement, leaving a commitment of 1,102 sorties or missions required by the
     monthly plan. Reapply the 25 percent attrition factor to the remaining sortie or mission
     commitment for 1,469 sorties or missions for the remaining 2 weeks. This leaves 147
     sorties or missions per day compared to the original of 128 sorties or missions per day.
     Because this is greater than the agreed sortie or mission count in the monthly plan, review
     maintenance and operational support capabilities for the inflated sortie or mission
     request. Again, depending on actual losses during the third week, a further decrease or
     increase may be required for the fourth week.
  13.11. After coordinating any necessary adjustments, OS commanders will document
  training requirements and maintenance capability and forward requests to the OSS operations
  scheduling. The OSS operations scheduling will coordinate and deconflict squadron requests
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                 25


  before the weekly scheduling meeting and forward any recommended changes to the
  operations scheduling section for review no later than 2 workdays before the meeting.
  13.12. Maintenance and operations schedulers will discuss weekly needs and arrive at an
  acceptable, coordinated schedule for the group commander’s review. PS&D will build,
  publish, and distribute the weekly schedule and will use Air Force scheduling forms or IMTs,
  locally approved IMTs, or locally developed spreadsheets.
  13.13. The weekly meeting will be convened no later than 1200 on Friday. SQ/CCs or their
  designated representatives will brief status and other information with an emphasis on trends
  and existing limitations that are hindering the monthly sortie or mission (or hourly)
  attainment. The WG/CC will sign the weekly plan.
  13.14. The OG/CC and MXG/CC will present the proposed schedule to the WG/CC for
  approval. If an agreement cannot be reached prior to the weekly scheduling meeting, the
  problem will be referred to the WG/CC for a decision. Once approved, the weekly schedule
  will become the final planning guide for both maintenance and operations and the basis for
  deviation reporting. Every effort will be made to execute the schedule as printed.
  13.15. After the weekly schedule is briefed and approved, MOF PS&D will consolidate,
  publish, and distribute it per AFI 21-101. They will ensure access to electronically
  developed maintenance and operational plans and schedules is accessible only to those areas
  that have a need for the information. The original copy will be filed and maintained in
  PS&D in accordance with the Air Force RDS.
  13.16. Changes to the printed weekly flying and utilization schedules require coordination
  and approval by the MXG/CC and OG/CC; exception: pure maintenance actions scheduled
  in the weekly schedule require MXG/CC coordination and approval only. The total number
  of sorties or missions and aircraft serial numbers, except when using the replacement rule in
  paragraph 19.3, will remain the same without incurring a deviation. Requirements may
  necessitate the conversion of out-and back (O&B) and cross-country (XC) sorties or missions
  to local sorties or missions or vice versa. Once the changes are made, normal deviation
  reporting applies. Remember, only launches by the parent maintenance organization are
  accountable in sortie scheduling effectiveness (SSE) computations.
     13.16.1. Use AF IMT 2407 to document weekly schedule changes prior to the start of the
     flying period and record these changes in the MIS. (AETC IMT 206C will only be used
     as a manual backup in the event of MIS nonavailability.) Deviations to the weekly
     schedule apply and are recorded even though a change is made using the AF IMT 2407.
     (AF IMT 2407 is a coordination sheet used to document the receipt of the changed
     information by all affected agencies.) The activity requesting the change will initiate AF
     IMT 2407 and ensure coordination with all affected activities. A detailed reason for the
     schedule change will be included on AF IMT 2407. NOTE: A change to the original
     printed takeoff or landing time of 15 minutes or less does not require an AF IMT 2407 to
     be initiated. However, munitions configuration changes require an AF IMT 2407,
     regardless of when the action is initiated.
         13.16.1.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) AF IMTs 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying
         Schedule Coordination, will be submitted and approved via e-mail. MX Division
         Chiefs, Deputy Director of Maintenance, or Director of Maintenance will be the
 26                               AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


          maintenance approving authorities for AF IMTs 2407. PS&D Supervisor, airframe
          specific PS&D scheduler, MOC Supervisor, and MOC Lead Controllers will be
          notified by copy on e-mail. During absences of the approving authorities, Division
          Superintendents, Maintenance Chief of Staff, Night Shift Aircraft Maintenance
          Coordinator, or Night Shift Production Superintendent may approve these requests.
      13.16.2. After coordination, PS&D will update the MIS for changes made before the
      daily scheduling meeting, and the MOC will update the MIS with changes made after the
      daily scheduling meeting. In addition, the MOC will annotate all changes in red on the
      weekly schedule maintained in the MOC. Maintenance analysis will use the MIS to
      review for trends and include the results in monthly summary reports. Commanders and
      schedulers will use trend results to identify and correct problems and to assist in building
      and executing future plans. Maintenance analysis will return the annotated schedules
      with (AF IMTs 2407) to PS&D or the MOC (established locally) for filing.
      13.16.3. For units that do not have an MIS, the MOC will forward the weekly schedule,
      including all AF IMT 2407s for the affected week, to maintenance analysis at the end of
      each flying week. Maintenance analysis will review for trends identified in the changes
      and include the results in monthly summary reports. Commanders and schedulers will
      use trend results to identify and correct trends and to assist in building and executing
      future plans. Maintenance analysis will return the annotated schedules (with AF IMTs
      2407) to either PS&D or the MOC (as local procedures dictate) for filing.
14. Flying the Schedule:
   14.1. Weekly Schedule. This schedule is the final planning guide for both maintenance and
   operations. Although changes to the weekly schedule are inevitable, changes that adversely
   affect maintenance or operations should be kept to a minimum. Operations scheduling and
   PS&D will maintain constant coordination to minimize the negative impact changes might
   have on achieving long range objectives and maximizing reaction time. Operations
   scheduling and PS&D will verbally coordinate changes to the weekly schedule no later than
   prior to the daily scheduling meeting or 1500. They will follow up verbal coordination on an
   AF IMT 2407 per paragraph 13.16.
   14.2. Alternate Schedule. If weather is questionable for night flying, operations scheduling
   may provide an alternate schedule for the following day (depending on the flying window,
   maintenance, and instructor capabilities) based on the successful completion of the night
   flying and it’s rescheduling. Operations scheduling will notify the MOC and flight line
   production superintendent by 2200 regarding which schedule to use.
   14.3. Delayed Launch. If a launch is delayed, operations scheduling will decide (after
   coordinating with the flight line production superintendent) if the sortie or mission should be
   cancelled (nondelivery for operations, maintenance or supply) to prevent hindering future
   aircrew or aircraft commitments. A delayed launch will be initiated before an aircraft’s crew
   ready time.
   14.4. Late Launch:
      14.4.1. If a scheduled sortie or mission does not launch within 1 hour (4 hours for Altus,
      Kirtland, Little Rock, Fairchild AFBs, and Ft Rucker only) after the scheduled takeoff
      time and there was no coordination between operations and maintenance prior to the crew
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                  27


     ready time, the sortie or mission will be terminated and the appropriate deviation will be
     recorded against maintenance, operations, or supply, as appropriate. NOTE: Verbal
     coordination can be used between operations and maintenance, however once a decision
     has been coordinated and agreed upon, maintenance must coordinate changes to the
     MOC.
     14.4.2. If the printed tail number is a ground abort and is replaced with a spare that does
     not take off within 1 hour (4 hours for Altus , Kirtland, Little Rock, Fairchild AFBs, Ft
     Rucker only) after the scheduled time, the MOC will record the ground abort, terminate
     the line, and add a new line (ops add) if requested.
     14.4.3. If no spare is available and an aircraft is added or the original aircraft launches
     after the 1 hour window (4 hours for Altus, Kirtland, Little Rock, Fairchild AFBs, Ft
     Rucker only) and the flight line production superintendent acknowledges supportability,
     the MOC will record an ops add. (This does not apply to weather-related delays.)
     14.4.4. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Subsequent sortie takeoff times resulting from
     accepting a spare and an approved chock extension may be adjusted as necessary to
     accommodate normal MX turn time. OPS and MX must jointly determine the spare’s
     chock time and MX will notify MOC of the new return to chock time. MX is responsible
     for filling subsequent schedule takeoff times.
  14.5. Early Launch. Early launches are authorized if the launch is consistent with mission
  control times and the flight line production superintendent acknowledges supportability.
  14.6. Interchanges:
     14.6.1. Interchanges should be used to prevent reconfiguration and unnecessary
     expenditures of work hours when the prime aircraft is NMC at its scheduled takeoff time.
     PS&D and/or the flight line production supervisor may interchange printed prime, spare,
     FCF, or OCF released or XC return aircraft without incurring deviations. Every effort
     must be made to make the interchanges at the daily maintenance scheduling meeting the
     day before the aircraft’s scheduled flight.
     14.6.2. Interchanges will be documented on an AF IMT 2407, except those outlined in
     AFI 21-101. PS&D will update the MIS for interchanges made before the daily
     scheduling meeting, and the MOC will update the MIS on any interchange made after the
     meeting and be notified of all interchanges.
  14.7. O&B or XC Sorties or Missions:
     14.7.1. When aircraft on an O&B or XC mission cannot return to home station as
     scheduled, the MOC will immediately notify PS&D, flight line production
     superintendent, and operations scheduling.
     14.7.2. Weather conditions and student progress may require the conversion of O&B and
     XC sorties or missions to locals. When converting an O&B or XC to a local sortie, the
     out portion will be converted nonchargeably, but the back portion will be recorded as a
     chargeable ops add if flown. Conversely, locals may be converted to O&B or XC.
     Convert local sorties to O&B or XC as follows; record the out portion as nonchargeable.
     For the back portion, sortie scheduling effectiveness is not affected since only launches
     by parent maintenance support are accountable in SSE (see 15.7.3). In the event that the
28                              AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


     conversion of local sorties to O&B or XC results in second and subsequent local sorties
     not being flown, record these sorties as a chargeable ops delete(s).
     14.7.3. Only launches by parent maintenance support of O&B and XC are accountable in
     sortie or mission scheduling effectiveness computations. Changes of this type must be a
     combined coordination effort between operations scheduling, PS&D, flight line
     production superintendent, and MOC to ensure affected aircraft meet the revised mission
     and tracking requirements.
     14.7.4. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Scheduling off-station aircraft during the week will
     result in an accompanying reduction in the daily number of prime fliers. NOTE: Failure
     to return aircraft by the scheduled NLT land time may result in a one-for-one cancellation
     of aircraft available for the following day’s flying schedule, beginning with the first
     scheduled takeoff.
         14.7.4.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Wing Programming and PS&D will
         coordinate normal flying schedules to the greatest extent possible to ensure the
         maximum number of off-station aircraft at any one time will not exceed 35 aircraft.
         The maximum number of off-station aircraft includes all non-mission capable (NMC)
         off-station aircraft, air shows, Instructor Enrichment Program (IEP)s, Continuation
         Training (CT), and student XC aircraft. Out and back sorties scheduled during weeks
         with large numbers of XC sorties may also impact or limit the number of XC sorties
         MX is able to provide. Requests for numbers above these must be authorized by the
         Director of Maintenance (DOM) or Deputy Director of Maintenance (DDOM).
     14.7.5. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) For weekend XC sorties, scheduled XC aircraft will
     normally recover on Sunday during the established recovery window.
     14.7.6. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Transient Alert support for Saturday launches and
     recoveries are negotiated by 47 FTW/MXZ and 47 CONS/LGCA. These launches and
     recoveries must be coordinated with 47FTW/MXZ and PS&D NLT 1400 on the Tuesday
     prior to the weekend of the requirement.
     14.7.7. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) When Laughlin aircraft are NMC off station, MX
     shall brief the WG/CC the aircraft location, discrepancy, the Wing responding to the
     aircraft, and ETIC daily. MX and OPS agree to give high priority to aircraft requiring
     ―rescue.‖ MX will determine and coordinate recovery efforts via MOC. After repairs are
     completed for NMC aircraft off station, MOC will notify OPS and request a ―rescue.‖ At
     its earliest opportunity, OPS shall dispatch aircrew to ―rescue‖ the off-station aircraft.
     All rescued aircraft shall return to home station via the most direct means available. XC
     aircrew may ―rescue‖ an off-station aircraft when returning to Laughlin by the most
     direct route, but may not continue their XC sorties in the ―rescue‖ aircraft, unless
     authorized by Squadron DO and MX Division Chief.
  14.8. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) Sortie or Mission. Tanker, airlift, tanker
  transport trainer, or rotary wing aircraft may implement ERCC procedures when it is not
  economical to generate a new aircraft for partially missed operational training objectives.
  During an ERCC, the aircrew maintains control of the aircraft. If an aircrew member does
  not remain during the crew swap, maintenance assumes responsibility for the aircraft and
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                    29


  maintenance inspections will be performed in accordance with the aircraft-specific technical
  guidance before the aircraft may relaunch.
  14.9. T-6 initial Solo ride. For T-6 initial student solo and instructor pilot seat change for
  currency, the aircrew will maintain control of the aircraft and no thru-flight will be
  performed IAW 1T-6A/B-6WC-1. However, for reporting purposes in IMDS this will be
  loaded as two separate lines but will be debriefed and counted as one sortie.
  14.10. Incomplete Training. This term is used to document student or crew who are
  incomplete on a sortie/mission due to not meeting required/planned training objectives.
  Incomplete training may result in a sortie or mission being documented as ―Ineffective‖, an
  operations determination. For example, if a student or crew has three training objectives
  scheduled for a sortie or mission and one of the requirements was not met, but is required for
  syllabus progression, a later sortie or mission line must be identified within that weekly
  schedule as an ERCC for the student to complete previously missed training events.
  Additionally, documenting incomplete training does not necessarily mean there was an air
  abort or an in-flight emergency.
  14.11. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Table 14.11. provides basic planning factors for daily
  flying schedules.
  14.12. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Crew Ready. The MOC will provide Mission Capable
  (MC) aircraft tail numbers ―Crew Ready‖ IAW Table 14.11.
  14.13. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Chock Time. Chock time is the time from scheduled
  takeoff time to aircraft return to parking spot (i.e. chocks). Chock times are IAW Table
  14.11.
  14.14. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Turn Time. Turn Time is the time from scheduled
  takeoff to next scheduled takeoff for local sorties. Turn times are IAW Table 14.11.
  14.15. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Refueling Operations. Refueling operations at Laughlin
  AFB are conducted by 47 LRD/LGRF (POL). For aircraft in which refueling operations are
  not completed in the specified times prior to takeoff time, the applicable MX expeditor will
  assign a spare against that sortie, if available. The crew may delay accepting a spare if the
  refueling operations ETIC of the original aircraft is such that the aircraft can reasonably be
  returned to MC status in less time than required to preflight and launch a spare. POL will
  complete refueling operations within the Minimum Turn Time IAW Table 14.11.
     14.15.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) If MOC fails to notify Fuels Control of schedule
     changes or an aircraft nearing takeoff time in a timely manner (NLT 15 minutes), it then
     becomes a Maintenance Non Delivery.
  14.16. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Functional Check Flight (FCF) and Transfer Aircraft.
  Aircraft requiring an FCF or scheduled for transfer will receive high priority to ensure they
  are accomplished as soon as practicable. Quality Assurance (QA) will notify the FCF Flight
  of aircraft requiring an FCF. PS&D will notify Squadron Programming of aircraft requiring
  transfer. Ferry flights/transfer aircraft should go directly to transfer destination and will be
  part of the weekly schedule when possible, but not considered a Prime Flier.
30                               AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


  14.17. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Deployments. Requests for deployment aircraft and
  personnel should be made to 47 FTW/MX as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days prior
  to the deployment. Deployments require 47 FTW/CC approval.
  14.18. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Additional Services.
     14.18.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Wing Programming is the POC for static displays
     and public affairs events (such as photographic opportunities), as well as the use of
     Wing/Group/Squadron Flagships for special events. Wing Programming shall deconflict
     requests, ensure the requests include all pertinent data for the event, and submit a request
     for services to PS&D for processing.
     14.18.2. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Requests for T-38 travel pods will be annotated in
     the remarks section on the OG Forms 206A and 206B.
     14.18.3. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Wing Programming is the POC for squadrons to
     submit requests for Red I Recoveries and Fini Flights. Fini Flights on the Red I are
     normally scheduled for the last flight of the day and will be reserved for field grade
     officers. Exceptions will be coordinated through the OG/CC and DOM. Other Fini
     Flight launches shall be done within the flight. T-6s use ―Kilo‖ Row for recoveries. For
     T-1s, ―OSCAR‖ Row shall be used. T-38s recover other Fini Flights within the flight.
     Fini Flights will be annotated in the remarks section on the OG Forms 206A and 206B.
     14.18.4. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Hangar requests require squadron commander
     approval and will be processed through PS&D and the DDOM using Attachment 8,
     Request for Hangar Use.
     14.18.5. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Airshow aircraft requests must be made to the
     DOM and Wing Programming prior to the 15th of the preceding month to the airshow.
     For example, a May airshow request should be made NLT 15 April. The DOM will
     advise the OG/CC of airshow location supportability and available maintenance recovery
     capabilities. Airshow aircraft and spare will be identified to ensure scheduled
     maintenance and inspections are complied with, and both aircraft will be scheduled for
     airshow preparations. The number of aircraft scheduled for air shows should be limited
     to no more than one aircraft per MDS per week. If the airshow prime and spare ground
     abort, taking a line aircraft is not approved. Airshow aircraft shall only fly the day of
     departure to the appointed airshow destination (no sorties will be scheduled on the
     aircraft prior to its departure). Any deviations to this policy must be approved by the
     OG/CC and DOM.
     14.18.6. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) ―Spouse taxis‖ should be annotated in the remarks
     section of the OG Form 206A for the affected week. A plan for use of aircraft will be
     provided in a separate ―taxi schedule‖ or annotated on the daily OG Form 206B and
     provided at the weekly scheduling meeting. Taxis are not counted as sorties on the OG
     Form 206A.
     14.18.7. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Pilot name change requests will be submitted by
     email to the appropriate aircraft scheduler, PS&D workleader, and PS&D supervisor
     during the first month of each quarter. These must be preapproved by the OG/CC IAW
     AETCI 21-106. Squadron representatives will be responsible for verifying submission
     accuracy.

15. Planned Surge:
   15.1. Surging is a management technique employed by the WG/CC and designed to
   temporarily produce sorties or missions at a higher-than-normal rate. For the purpose of this
   instruction, a sortie or mission surge for units that fly trainer-designated aircraft is an
   increase of at least 15 percent over the average daily sortie or mission rate and an increase of
   a least 50 percent for other units.
   15.2. Maintenance and operations must work together with the functional commander (FC),
   administrative contracting officer (ACO) (if a contracted activity), and any other support
   activity that may be affected by the surge to ensure proper coordination during the planning
   processes. The number of sorties or missions increased is determined by the training
   objective. Surge scheduling should only be used on a limited basis to recover lost sorties or
   missions or to purposely exceed or ―get ahead‖ in preparation of future known events that
   will cause a decrease in sortie or mission production. Units should plan to get the maximum
   number of sorties or missions possible from each airframe committed to the schedule.
   Surges may also be employed when part of a squadron is deployed.
   15.3. When planning a sortie or mission surge, take full advantage of the available flying
   and maintenance training period by performing concurrent aircraft inspection and servicing
   procedures. When planning surges, keep in mind that there may be some maintenance
   contracts that contain a maximum allowable number of sorties or missions that may be flown
   on a daily basis. NOTE: To determine the average daily sortie or mission rate when
   planning a sortie or mission surge in a particular month, take the number of sorties or
   missions planned for that month from the annual plan (Attachment 3) and divide that number
   by the number of O&M days in that month.
   15.4. Surging significantly increases the tempo of all activities involved in flying and
   producing sorties or missions. A surge can decrease aircraft mission capable rates by
   creating a backlog of unscheduled maintenance affecting future airframe capability and/or
   availability. Ineffective sorties or missions, an adverse effect on student and instructor
   capability, syllabus constraints, and overextending scarce resources also must be considered
   when scheduling surges.

   15.4. (LAUGHLINAFB) The official timekeeper for deviation purposes will be MOC.
   The applicable MX expeditor will notify MOC of crew shows, spare and interchange
   assignments (tail swaps), and inchock times.
   15.5. As a minimum, assign line numbers, aircraft tail numbers, takeoff and land times,
   configurations, type missions, and the priority in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule
   for the first sortie or mission launch. Only line numbers (the total number of sorties or
   missions the unit intends to fly), configurations, and type missions are required for
   subsequent launch lines. Returning MC aircraft may be inserted into the next open line as
   determined by aircraft-land status. If more sorties or missions were flown than intended,
   they will be considered flown as scheduled. For all other deviations, normal deviation
   reporting applies. Manage spare aircraft according to paragraph 6.
   15.5. (LAUGHLINAFB) See current Operations/Maintenance Deviation                       Matrix
   (Attachment 6) for disposition of sorties and locally assigned tracking codes.
   15.6. There are limitations on the frequency and duration of a surge for civil service and
   contract activities. Specifically, surging will not be employed for more than 2 days in a
   monthly flying period. Waivers must be submitted to HQ AETC/A3 and HQ AETC/A4 for
   approval.
   15.7. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Surges will be accommodated and flown in accordance
   with procedures in AETCI 21-104. The average daily sortie rate from the annual plan will be
   compared against the Required Sorties (block 2a on the OG Form 206A) to determine if a
   surge request is required.
16. Combat Generation. Generations are conducted as outlined in applicable Air Force
guidance and unit plans. Scheduling procedures are as follows:
   16.1. Publish a weekly schedule, but once the exercise is initiated, cancel that day’s printed
   schedule without recording deviations. Hold the remainder of the weekly schedule in
   abeyance until the exercise has terminated.
   16.2. Before publishing the air tasking order (ATO), determine the total number of aircraft
   that maintenance can support versus operational requirements.
   16.3. Ensure the ATO contains the mission number, on-status time or time on target, and
   configurations. Prepare and finalize a daily flying schedule that identifies aircraft tail
   numbers, including spares for the first launch period no later than 2 hours prior to the first
   on-status or takeoff time. When using a scramble scenario, establish a launch window
   timeframe instead of takeoff times. Report nondeliveries as deviations.
   16.4. When the exercise is terminated, revise the original weekly schedule by replacing it
   without reporting deviations. After approval of a new weekly schedule, normal deviation
   reporting procedures will resume.
17. Deviations (General): (NOTE: Also, see paragraph 18 for chargeable deviations and
paragraph 19 for nonchargeable deviations.)
   17.1. Deviation recording is a management tool for identifying and correcting trends. (See
   Table 1 for common deviation determinations.) The MOC will record all chargeable and
   nonchargeable deviations from the approved, printed weekly schedule in the MIS. AETC
   IMT 206C will only be used as a manual backup in the event the MIS becomes inoperative.
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                    33


     (See Attachment 3 for instructions on completing AETC IMT 206C.) Deviations recorded on
     the AETC IMT 206C will be input into the MIS by MOC personnel within 24 hours after
     system recovery.

                                                                 MND will also be recorded
                                                                 against the line but is not

    17.2. Deviations to the schedule are considered either chargeable or nonchargeable for the
    purpose of computing sortie or mission scheduling effectiveness. The MOC will review
    online sortie or mission recaps at the completion of each flying period, ensuring deviation
    reporting accuracy. If the MIS is inoperative, AETC IMT 206C must be used. The MOC
    will deliver a copy of the previous day’s completed IMT to maintenance analysis each
    morning.
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                      35


   17.3. Deviation reporting is applicable to all AETC-possessed aircraft. When an aircraft
   ground-aborts and the abort is associated with a nondelivery, multiple deviations will be
   recorded but the MND will not be computed in SSE (see Table 1, item 12). When assessing
   deviations, always ask, ―What caused the event?‖ Normally, the first event in a sequence of
   events is the primary cause for a deviation. For example, late crew arrival at the aircraft or
   operations refusal to accept an MC spare is not always a maintenance nondelivery.
18. Chargeable Deviations. These are variations to the flying schedule that are within the
control of the local authority. Chargeable deviations are as follows:
   18.1. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC). ERCC sorties or missions printed in the
   weekly schedule that are not flown (paragraph 14.8) are charged to the agency that caused
   the deviation. EXCEPTION: A deviation will not be recorded for an ERCC if all of the
   following conditions exist:
      18.1.1. The aircraft is required to be shut down to facilitate maintenance actions.
      18.1.2. Repairs are made while operations maintains control of the aircraft.
      18.1.3. The sortie or mission can be launched to meet mission requirements.
   18.2. Ground Abort (GA):
      18.2.1. A GA is the discovery of a maintenance discrepancy after aircrew arrival that
      prevents that crew and aircraft from becoming airborne in time to complete the scheduled
      mission. The following are examples of what will normally be classified as a GA:
          18.2.1.1. If a ground aborted aircraft is replaced by a spare and the spare can meet
          mission requirements, the original aircraft is coded as a GA.
          18.2.1.2. If a spare aircraft is available for an aborted aircraft, but the spare cannot
          meet mission requirements and the sortie or mission is not flown, a nondelivery will
          also be recorded against the responsible agency (maintenance or operations) as
          determined locally.
          18.2.1.3. If an aircraft lands Code 2 or 3 and bypasses the hot pits to take a spare
          aircraft, only the spare action is recorded. If the aircraft lands, takes fuel via the hot
          pits, incurs an NMC condition after completion of hot pit refueling (receptacle
          disconnected) and can no longer continue, a GA is recorded.
      18.2.2. GAs are only chargeable against the prime aircraft; that is, only one GA is
      chargeable per sortie or mission line. Additional GAs (spare or interchange) against the
      same sortie or mission are documented as nonchargeable for SSE. GAs on FCFs or
      OCFs are nonchargeable.
   18.3. Nondelivery. Nondelivery is a scheduled sortie or mission not flown due to
   maintenance nondelivery (MND), operations nondelivery (OND), or supply nondelivery
   (SND) Every effort must be made to determine the root cause for a nondelivery in order to
   prevent future missed training opportunities. An available MC aircraft refused by operations
   is not in itself an MND. Likewise, late arrival of an aircrew to a spare or interchangeable
   aircraft does not automatically create an OND. As determined locally, the nondelivery will
   be charged to the agency that caused the missed event.
      18.3.1. The following are examples of what will normally be classified as an MND:
36                                AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


        18.3.1.1. Aircraft undergoing repairs.
        18.3.1.2. Maintenance inspection not completed.
        18.3.1.3. Servicing not completed.
        18.3.1.4. Aircraft de-icing not completed.
        18.3.1.5. No launch personnel.
        18.3.1.6. No spare or interchangeable aircraft.
     18.3.2. The following are examples of what will normally be classified as an OND:
     (NOTE: If the first sortie or mission of the same or next day for an instructor or student
     [after being identified as DNIF] is flown by an alternate instructor or student and the
     sortie or mission proceeds as scheduled, no deviation is recorded. If an alternate
     instructor or student is not identified and the sortie or mission does not fly, OND,
     chargeable against the first scheduled flight, is recorded. DNIFs will be included in
     operations attrition factor development.)
        18.3.2.1. Late crew show.
        18.3.2.2. Scheduling conflict for instructor or student.
        18.3.2.3. Late return from previous sortie or mission.         (See the exception in
        paragraph 19.6.7.)
        18.3.2.4. Aircraft over ―G.‖
        18.3.2.5. Gear or flap over speed.
        18.3.2.6. Hard landing.
        18.3.2.7. Foreign object in the cockpit dropped by the aircrew (pencil, helmet screw,
        etc.).
     18.3.3. The following are examples of what will normally be classified as an SND:
        18.3.3.1. A scheduled sortie or mission is cancelled due to lack of repair parts, fuel
        availability, or parts not available within prescribed pickup or delivery times Pickup
        or delivery times are established in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, USAF Supply
        Manual, or the contractor operated and maintained base supply (COMBS) contract.
        18.3.3.2. A serviceable item was not available and the removed reparable item could
        not be repaired off-equipment due to nonavailability of parts prior to the scheduled
        takeoff time.
        18.3.3.3. A late delivery of POL directly resulted in missed operational training.
        NOTE: Do not record an SND for aircraft restricted to ―solo only‖ if the restriction
        will not hinder training objectives.
     18.3.4. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) When a Prime Flier ground aborts and a spare is
     offered, but is:
        18.3.4.1. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Refused by the aircrew, OPS will be charged
        an Ops Non-Delivery (OND).
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                    37


           18.3.4.2. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Unusable to complete an effective mission due
           to the delay, MX will be charged a Maintenance Non-Delivery (MND).
           18.3.4.3. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) Unusable due to ITS Caution/Danger or other
           adverse weather, it will be a weather loss.
       18.3.5. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) In the event of an over-G, overspeed, or other ops-
       related event which makes the aircraft unavailable for the remainder of the day, the first
       non-delivery following this event will be charged against Operations. This will occur
       after all available aircraft committed to the schedule (prime fliers and spares) have been
       exhausted. Ops may be charged for one nondelivery for each subsequent turn. Example:
       an over-G in the 1st go can result in one OND in the second turn and one OND in the
       third turn.
   18.4. Additions:
       18.4.1. Additions are aircraft or sorties/missions added to the weekly schedule that are
       not on the previously printed schedule and are outside the nonchargeable replacement
       windows. Additions will be recorded against the agency requesting the addition.
       18.4.2. Additions that exceed the current number of weather losses available for use to
       bring the student timeline and CT requirement back to even will be recorded as
       chargeable operations additions.
   18.5. Deletions. Deletions are sorties or missions scheduled, without an attempt to launch,
   that were deleted and not flown. Deletions are also aircraft scheduled, but removed from the
   weekly schedule. The following terms apply:
       18.5.1. ―Maintenance delete‖ pertains to aircraft removed from the daily portion of the
       weekly schedule prior to aircrew arrival and the sortie or mission was not flown.
       18.5.2. Operations delete pertains to sorties or missions scheduled, but not attempted for
       operations reasons, excluding other deletions (paragraph 19.6.3).
19. Nonchargeable Deviations. Nonchargeable deviations are variations to the weekly
schedule attributable to, or resulting from, events or factors not within the control of the local
authority, as follows:
   19.1. Weather Additions. Additions to the daily portion of the schedule may be required to
   compensate for higher-than-projected weather losses. When weather losses occur, sorties or
   missions may be added back into current and subsequent weekly schedules, as necessary, to
   bring the student timeline and CT requirements back to even without incurring any
   chargeable deviation. These provisions are applicable any time during the execution of the
   annual FHP. Nonchargeable weather cancels or additions will not be used in sortie or
   mission scheduling effectiveness computations. NOTE: Off-station, weather-cancelled
   sorties or missions may be added back on a one-for-one basis at the off-station location.
   19.2. Weather Deletions. These deletions are scheduled sorties or missions not flown due
   to adverse weather impacting mission accomplishment at local, destination, en route, or
   alternate locations. This includes sorties or missions not flown due to exceeding the thermal
   heat index or allowable wind chill index.

  19.3. NMC Aircraft Replacement. When changes to the weekly schedule are required to
  compensate for unscheduled maintenance, an NMC aircraft may be replaced, nonchargeable.
  The replacement aircraft must be chosen at least 12 hours prior to the first scheduled takeoff
  of the next day or up to 1 hour after the last scheduled landing of the current day’s flying.
  This also applies to aircraft shown as spares in the weekly schedule. NOTE: Record a
  maintenance delete against the removed aircraft if it is replaced outside the nonchargeable
  replacement window. For units with more than one flying squadron the nonchargeable
  replacement window is based on individual squadron flying hour windows and not the wing
  flying hour window.
  19.4. Air Abort. An air abort is a sortie or mission on an airborne aircraft that is terminated
  due to an in-flight aircraft system malfunction and prevents the completion of minimum
  sortie/mission requirements. An air abort is considered a sortie or mission flown when
  reporting total sorties or missions flown. An air abort will not be recorded when
  malfunctions occur during the before-takeoff checklist portion of helicopter sorties or
  missions. A noneffective sortie or mission or the early return of an aircraft does not
  necessarily mean an air abort occurred unless there is an in-flight aircraft system
  malfunction. NOTE: Effective sortie or mission determination will be made by operations.
  19.5. Ground Abort (GA). Only the first GA is chargeable against any single sortie or
  mission line. All other GAs against that sortie or mission will continue to be recorded, but as
  nonchargeable against the sortie or mission scheduling effectiveness rate. All GAs count
  toward the abort rate computation identified in AETCI 21-105.
  19.6. Other Category (OT). OT deviations to the weekly schedule that are not normally
  ascribed against maintenance or operations are as follows:
     19.6.1. Sorties or missions added to the daily schedule for reasons beyond the control of
     the local authority; for example, higher headquarters and distinguished visitors (DV)
     sorties or missions (excluding incentive and familiarization flights) and FCF, OCF, and
     ferry sorties or missions. Training sorties or missions that were sympathy deletions
     (paragraph 19.6.8), but were added back to the schedule are considered flown as
     scheduled. Sorties or missions added back to the schedule after being cancelled by the
     Supervisor of Flying for birds in the area are nonchargeable operations adds.
     19.6.2. Incentive and familiarization flights flown at the XC location of a deployed unit.
     These are considered flown as scheduled.
     19.6.3. Sorties or missions not flown due to:
         19.6.3.1. Lost air traffic control capability/determination, unprogrammed runway
         closure, total loss of required communications or equipment, or evacuation due to
         bomb threat. Also, random natural acts such as lightning strikes.
         19.6.3.2. A bird strike on a previous sortie or mission when there is no spare or
         interchangeable aircraft available. This is only authorized for use on the day of the
         incident.
         19.6.3.3. Higher headquarters or DV sorties or missions (excluding incentive and
         familiarization flights). This does not include higher headquarters or DV sorties or
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                     39


          missions cancelled due to chargeable deviations within the control of local authority
          (paragraph 18).
          19.6.3.4. Recommendation from the Supervisor of Flying or equivalent for safety
          concerns based on the quantity of birds in the area.
       19.6.4. Aircraft grounded or restricted from a scheduled mission because of an
       immediate action TCTO or one-time inspection.
       19.6.5. Deviations resulting from a WG/CC-directed exercise, including force protection
       conditions (FPCON).
       19.6.6. Notification of an unscheduled WG/CC safety briefing.
       19.6.7. The inability of an aircrew instructor or student to return to the home station from
       an O&B or a XC mission solely because of aircraft servicing delays at the transient
       location.
       19.6.8. Another scheduled aircraft’s abort or nondelivery sympathy.
       19.6.9. To prevent unnecessary expenditures of resources, UTE management can be used
       any day of the month when less-than-programmed attrition occurs and all training
       requirements for scheduled profile objectives have been met. For example, Monday thru
       Thursday are required night sorties or missions with Friday as an attrition day for those
       night sorties or missions. Zero night sorties or missions were lost Monday thru Thursday
       so Friday’s attrition night sorties or missions could be deleted while other training
       requirement profile objectives scheduled for Friday must still be accomplished. Notify
       the appropriate maintenance functions of UTE cancellations as soon as the requirement is
       known. Not intended to be used as a cover for poor scheduling or to hide deviations and
       should be used as a last option after attempting to make mission changes or moving
       training requirements. For year end management, refer to paragraph 7.
       19.6.10. ERCC sorties or missions added for incomplete training.                These are
       nonchargeable if added during the same week a training event was lost.
       19.6.11. Record the deviation as nonchargeable when an aircraft is at an off-station
       location, cannot return to home station for its scheduled sorties or mission, and a home
       station spare is not available to fly the sorties or missions. If the aircraft can return to
       home station for its scheduled sortie or mission from the off-station location, no deviation
       is incurred. NOTE: Sorties or missions not supported by parent maintenance support
       are considered flown as scheduled and are not used in scheduling effectiveness
       computations.
20. Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE) Rate: The purpose of the MSE rate is to
measure the success of a unit in executing its planned maintenance schedule. Scheduled actions
and their respective weighted factor points in Figure 2 will be used to compute the MSE rate.
See Table 2 for sample computations for these scheduled actions. The MSE rate is the
percentage of scheduled aircraft maintenance actions that were completed on or prior to the
scheduled date printed in the weekly schedule.
   20.1. Pen and ink changes will be allowed purely for maintenance and training action
   changes to the weekly schedule. Changes must be documented using an AF Form 2407
   labeled ―Pen and Ink Changes‖ and coordinated and approved by the MXG/CC or DOM
 40                                 AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


     NLT Friday @1600 prior to the effective week. Once these changes are made, normal
     deviation reporting applies.

NOTES:
1. Points are only earned for scheduled maintenance events on tail numbers printed in the weekly
schedule. Use the event completion month as the basis for when to calculate possible points and
points earned.
2. Column F (Points Earned) ÷ Column D (Possible Points) x 100 = MSE Percent.
3. Non-PE, ISO, HSC, or HPO requirements.
     20.2. The MIS and the published weekly schedule will be used to determine whether
     maintenance actions and training events/static displays were completed on time. An action is
     considered completed on time if the date entered in the event ID in the MIS is consistent with
     the date scheduled in the weekly schedule or if a training event /static display is completed
     on the date scheduled. TCTOs and TCIs compliance are based off the day the task is
     scheduled in the weekly schedule unless scheduled during a Phase, PE, HPO or ISO; the
     completion of the task will then be based on the completion of the inspection.
 42                                AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


   20.3. Phase, PE, HPO, and ISO inspections will be measured against the scheduled
   completion date for the ―look‖ portion of the inspection only. NOTE: Aircraft Fleet time
   will be updated in the MIS upon completion of the phase package. The phase package will
   consist of all work cards associated with the phase and identified in the respective aircraft -6
   TO. Phase is considered complete when all work cards loaded in IMDS for the entire phase
   package are completed and WCE 1 is signed off generating suspense to P&S for clearing and
   phase next due time update. Any additional work beyond completion of the phase work card
   package will be carried forward as unscheduled maintenance and will be signed off separate
   from the original phase package.
Do not count (earned or possible) any of the following scheduled maintenance actions into the
MSE rate:
       20.3.1. Maintenance cancelled due to severe weather, weather diverts, aircraft not able to
       return to base due to maintenance malfunction, or impounded aircraft.
       20.3.2. Cancelled maintenance actions to comply with a higher headquarters tasking and
       notification of an immediate action TCTO or OTI that prevents the scheduled
       maintenance from being performed.
   20.4. When computing MSE, record detailed reasons for missing scheduled maintenance
   actions. A low MSE rate may indicate a unit is experiencing turbulence on the flight line, in
   the back shops or even other areas outside of maintenance (i.e. operations, supply etc). This
   indicator is primarily used as feedback to maintenance managers on the success and
   adherence to scheduled maintenance plans and the wing’s ability to support these actions.
   20.5. The MXG/CC may select additional areas for local scheduling effectiveness tracking
   (Table 2, Item 12).
21. Spare Rate Factor:
   21.1. Computation. Based on historical data of the unit from previous similar flying
   months. Minimum spare aircraft requirement factors will be calculated against first-go
   sorties or missions by MSDA. These factors will be provided to the appropriate maintenance
   scheduling function. The following is an example how to determine the spare factor:




       21.1.1. The spare factor is determined by adding the total logistics nondelivery and GA
       percentage factors for the planning period. Contact maintenance analysis for these rates.
       21.1.2. Spare rate = spare factor x total average first-go launches. This is the spare
       aircraft required to support the schedule. Round decimals up to the next whole number.
   21.2. Application. The formula to determine minimum spare aircraft required is as follows:
   First-go sorties or missions scheduled X spare factor = minimum number of spare aircraft
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                   43


   required rounded to next whole number. This may be adjusted to compensate for unusual
   configurations such as tow dart, flare pods, etc. For example, 12 first-go sorties or missions
   and using the spare factor from paragraph 21.1; that is, 12 x .18 = 2.16 (number of spares
   required is 3).

Terms
Additions—Sorties or missions or aircraft flown, but not printed, on the weekly utilization and
maintenance schedule for a given day.
Adjustment—A formally coordinated change to a unit’s annual FHP. An adjustment changes
the total annual allocation and usually results in a reflow.
Attrition (aircraft)—Excess to PAI requirements procured to ensure aircraft fleet size remains
the same, both at the beginning and end of the life cycle. No operating resources are allocated
for these aircraft in the defense budget.
Attrition (sorties or missions)—Losses expected based on historical data. Sorties or missions
added by maintenance scheduling to a unit’s sortie or mission requirement to allow for expected
losses due to maintenance, operations, supply, air traffic control, sympathy, higher headquarters,
other cancels, and weather cancels. Attrition sorties or missions are not substitutes for capability
shortfalls; they are added to the contract to ensure mission goals are met.
Attrition rate (hours, sorties, or missions)—Percent of scheduled hours, sorties or missions
that are cancelled (log zero time) for any reason (operations, maintenance, weather, other).
Average daily sortie rate—The number of sorties or missions planned for that month from the
annual plan divided by the number of O&M days in that month.
Average sortie duration (ASD)—The average time flown per sortie by type of aircraft,
determined by dividing total hours flown by total sorties flown. HQ AETC/A3 establishes the
annual planning ASD. The ASD is not used as a flying objective.
Average mission duration (AMD)—The average time flown permission by type of aircraft,
determined by dividing total hours flown by total missions flown. HQ AETC/A3 establishes the
annual planning AMD. The AMD is not used as a flying objective.
Backup aircraft inventory (BAI)—Aircraft over and above the PAI to permit scheduled and
unscheduled depot-level maintenance, modifications, inspections, and repair without a reduction
of aircraft for the operation tasking. No operating resources are allocated for these aircraft in the
defense budget.
Cross—Country (XC) Mission—A scheduled mission planned to remain overnight at other
than home station or auxiliary field.
Deviation—A departure from the printed weekly utilization and maintenance schedule.
Engine running crew change (ERCC)—A sortie or mission scheduled to relaunch a tanker,
airlift, tanker transport trainer, or rotary wing aircraft after a crewmember change without
shutting down engines. The purpose of this scheduled event is to make up for partially missed
operational training events that occurred on previous sortie or missions.
——An ERCC does not require any aircraft maintenance support except to meet local safety
requirements (marshalling, safety or fire guard, etc.).
 48                                AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


——If an ERCC is not printed in the weekly schedule, but required due to a missed operational
training event, it must be added using an AF IMT 2407.
——An ERCC is a scheduled event and is used in sortie or mission effectiveness computations
when printed in future weekly schedules.
——Do not use an ERCC in sortie or mission effectiveness computations if the ERCC sortie or
mission is added during the same week an objective is lost.
Ferry sorties or missions—Sorties or missions used to support unscheduled depot input and
return, transfer, etc. When sortie or mission requirements are known prior to printing the flying
schedule, include them in the weekly schedule and identify the type in the applicable remarks
column. Any deviations that occur are nonchargeable and not used in scheduling effectiveness
computations. Use the ―other‖ category to record sortie or mission cancellations. Ferry sortie or
mission requirements generated too late for inclusion in the flying schedule will be documented
as a new line and considered flown as scheduled.
First—Go sortie—The first scheduled takeoff for a single or group of aircraft.
Historical attrition—Average historical sortie or mission losses for maintenance, operations,
weather, other, and supply. Schedulers use historical attrition when completing AETC IMTs 206
and 206A. Attrition is always expressed as additions to the sortie or mission or hourly
requirement.
Ineffective sortie or mission—A sortie or mission that did not complete minimum training
requirements as determined by the aircrew. Therefore another sortie or mission is required to
complete the original training objective. Commanders establish ineffective sortie or mission
guidelines in the form of a local OI to ensure consistency in determining refly factors. See refly
rate.
Interchange—Printed aircraft tail number swaps made to the daily portion of the weekly
schedule.
Local sortie or mission—Sorties or missions launched at the home station (includes O&B and
XC) or a deployed location when launched and recovered by parent maintenance support.
Includes deployed sorties or missions flown geographically away from home base or at
simulated isolated areas on home base.
Maintenance attrition rate—Average percentage of scheduled sorties or missions not flown
due to maintenance nondeliveries.
Mission—A primary objective for which an aircraft is operated. It may consist of an increment
of one or more sorties. For example, a mission may involve two sorties or, in the case of an
inflight refueling, several missions may be accomplished in one sortie (AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management).
Monthly flying and maintenance plan—The combination of planned monthly sorties or
missions and maintenance events planned in support of those sorties or missions that will be
performed during the effective month. A systematic approach of matching operational
requirements to maintenance capabilities (AFI 21-101 and its AETC Sup 1).
Monthly sortie or mission contract—A written agreement approved by the WG/CC that
specifies the number of sorties or missions and hours to be flown during the monthly period
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                      49


designated. The contract does not include attrition sorties or missions nor are attrition sorties or
missions substitutes for capability shortfalls. The contract is based on student production, UTE
rates, and instructor and maintenance capabilities.
Off—station sortie or mission—All sorties or missions launched from other than the home
station and/or auxiliary field not supported by the parent maintenance support.
Operation and maintenance (O&M) days—The number of calendar days in a year, month, or
week minus Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays.
Operations adds—Sorties or missions added by operations to the weekly schedule.
Operations attrition rate—Average percentage of scheduled sorties or missions not flown for
operational reasons (for example, aircrew nonavailability).
Operations deletion—Sorties or missions deleted by operations from the weekly schedule.
Operations squadron—Synonymous with flying squadron, fighter squadron, training squadron,
or airlift squadron.
Other attrition rate—Average percentage of scheduled sorties or missions not flown due to
factors beyond the control of the unit (for example, air traffic control or higher headquarters).
Out and back (O&B) mission—A mission scheduled to depart and return on the same day,
consisting of at least one off-station launch.
Primary aircraft inventory (PAI)—Aircraft assigned to meet the primary aircraft authorization
for performance of the operational and support mission to include wing-level maintenance
requirements. PAI forms the basis of the allocation of operating resources to include manpower,
support equipment, and flying hour funds. For aircraft managed under an Hourly UTE rate:
Calculated as annual hours required divided by the programmed annual UTE rate divided by 12
months. For aircraft managed under a Sortie UTE rate: Calculate as annual hours required
divided by programmed annual UTE rate divided by 12 months divided by the programmed
ASD.
Prime fliers—Number of aircraft committed to the daily schedule excluding spare aircraft,
aircraft required for FCFs, and aircraft required for ferry sorties or missions.
Reconstitution reserve—Aircraft currently stored, but planned to return to operation.
Commonly referred to as flyable storage aircraft.
Reflow—A reallocation of program elements (hours, sorties or missions, ASD/AMD, UTE)
carried out across the remainder of the month or year that does not change the total annual
allocation. Reflows will always accompany a flying hour adjustment. Reflows of execution
deviations may or may not be applied to execution models.
Refly rate (hours, sorties, or missions)—Hours, sorties, or missions flown in excess of syllabus
requirements, expressed as a percentage. Includes any student sorties or missions that were
airborne, but were incomplete or unsatisfactory, required additional training, etc. Only applies to
student training sorties or missions. Does not include cancelled hours, sorties, or missions.
Required sorties or missions—Number of sorties or missions to be flown to meet wing
objectives. These are the numbers of sorties or missions that ensure training and proficiency
requirements are met as reflected in the AETC PA. Includes refly sorties or missions. For an
 50                                 AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


hourly UTE rate, required hours, sorties, or missions are the number of hours, sorties, or
missions that ensure training and proficiency requirements are met by achieving the annual goal
reflected in the AETC PA.
Scheduled sorties or missions—The sum of required and attrition sorties or missions.
Scheduled takeoff—The takeoff time printed in the daily portion of the weekly schedule for
each sortie or mission line number. If the sortie or mission line number takeoff time is changed
at the daily scheduling meeting for the next day and recorded on an AF IMT 2407, that time
becomes the new scheduled takeoff time. A sortie or mission line number takeoff time change of
± 15 minutes does not require an AF IMT 2407, but it must be agreed to by maintenance and
now becomes the new scheduled takeoff time.
Sortie—The definition of a sortie is outlined in AFI 11-401, In addition the following rules
apply:
1. A sortie ends when performing a refuel operation (actual or simulated).
2. A series of practice landings (touch and gos) will be debriefed as one sortie or mission.
3. Helicopter sorties with multiple landings and takeoffs will be documented as one sortie
(line #) unless stopped based on the definition in AFI 11—401 and AETCI 21-104.
4. Multiple helicopter takeoffs and landings involving FCF requirements will be documented as
one sortie or mission.
5. Each sortie or mission will be debriefed in the MIS with a unique sortie or mission line
number.
EXCEPTIONS: During training missions that require the uploading or downloading of
paratroopers or passengers, the aircraft may be shut down during this operation and once readied
for takeoff will be considered an extension of the original sortie or mission. (This does not
include crewmembers.)
Spare aircraft—Aircraft committed to the flying schedule in addition to the prime flyers.
Spares are identified on the flying schedule to be used at the discretion of the production
supervisor to replace NMC or PMC aircraft when needed. Other aircraft considered as useable
spares are those that have flown in an earlier sortie or mission on the day needed, to include
FCF- or OCF-released aircraft and those scheduled for a sortie or mission that has been cancelled
or aborted.
Student sorties or missions—Sorties or missions necessary to accomplish the current syllabus
of instruction.
Supply—The average percentage of scheduled sorties or missions not flown due to
nonavailability of mission essential parts (to include CLS-provided support equipment) or fuel.
Support sorties or missions—Nonstudent sorties or missions required in support of the mission
by AFI 11-401; AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; and the
applicable AETC 51-series directives.
Sympathy aborts or delays—Deviations that occur when a flight of two or more aircraft under
the command of a flight leader or instructor pilot are deleted, aborted, or late due to a deletion,
abort, or delay of one or more of the aircraft in the flight or a supporting flight. Dissimilar air
AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012                                                  51


combat tactics delayed by the other aircraft. Cancellations caused by an aircraft’s scheduled
tanker, receiver, or mission event.
“T” designated aircraft—A term used to describe AETC-assigned aircraft that are designated
as trainers; that is, all MDSs of the T-1, T-6, and T-38 aircraft.
Total aircraft inventory (TAI)—Aircraft assigned to operating forces for mission
accomplishment. Includes PAI, attrition, BAI, and reconstitution reserve.
Turnaround time—The time from takeoff to takeoff for the same aircraft.
UTE rate—The average number of required sorties or missions (or hours) flown (planned or
actual) per PAI aircraft for a specific timeframe. HQ AETC/A4 establishes the annual maximum
sustainable UTE rate. The monthly UTE rate is calculated as monthly sorties or missions (or
hours) flown divided by PAI. The annual UTE rate is calculated as annual sorties or missions (or
hours) flown divided by PAI divided by 12 months.
Weather attrition rate—Average percentage of scheduled sorties or missions not flown due to
weather.

     INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING AETC IMT 206, MONTHLY FLYING
                          COORDINATION

A4.1. Cumulative FY UTE Data (Block 1). Fill in the header information as appropriate.
NOTE: A locally developed product may be used in lieu of AETC IMT 206, but it must include
all data listed in this attachment.
   A4.1.1. Block 1a. Planned cumulative data for hours, sorties, or missions and UTE to date.
   A4.1.2. Block 1b. Actual cumulative data for hours, sorties, or missions and UTE flown to
   date.
   A4.1.3. Block 1c. Variance cumulative data or delta for the fiscal year. The difference
   between Blocks 1a and 1b.
A4.2. Student Event Time-Line Position (Block 2): (NOTE: For students not tracked by
time-line position, this data is not required.)
   A4.2.1. Block 2a. Current student event time-line position.
   A4.2.2. Block 2b. Projected student event time-line position based on flying the planned
   month’s UTE.
A4.3. Attrition Data (Block 3):
   A4.3.1. Block 3a. Planned cumulative attrition (sorties, missions, or hours).
   A4.3.2. Block 3b. Actual cumulative attrition (sorties, missions, or hours) experienced.
   A4.3.3. Block 3c. Variance cumulative attrition or delta (sorties, missions, or hours).
A4.4. Historical Attrition (Block 4). The percent of attrition forecast to be lost for weather,
maintenance, supply, operations (not sorties or missions lost to aircrew DNIF, ERCC, or
ineffective sorties or missions), other, and total.
   A4.4.1. Block 4a. The top lists the weather percent factor, and the bottom lists the prorated
   weather attrition sorties or missions added each day for the month. Prorated weather attrition
   sorties or missions are used for managing nonchargeable weather additions. For prorated
   sorties or missions computation application, required sorties or missions are divided by 1
   minus the weather factor equals weather sorties or missions scheduled. Weather sorties or
   missions scheduled subtracted from required sorties or missions equals expected weather
   losses. Then divide expected weather losses by O&M days. These are the daily-prorated
   weather additions. For example, if Block 5a is 2,102 and the top of Block 4a is 20%, 2,102 /
   (1-.20) equals 2,628 sorties or missions, 2,628 minus 2,102 equals 526 weather attrition
   sorties or missions, and 21 O&M days equals 25 sorties or missions added each day for
   weather.
   A4.4.2. Block 4b. Percentage of projected maintenance losses.
   A4.4.3. Block 4c. Percentage of projected losses for supply.
   A4.4.4. Block 4d. Percentage of projected operational losses.
 56                               AETCI21-104_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2012


   A4.4.5. Block 4e. Percentage of projected losses due to factors other than maintenance,
   supply, or operations.
   A4.4.6. Block 4f. Total attrition factor used for additions to the monthly plan.
A4.5. Sortie Data (Block 5). Squadron operations scheduling determines the required sortie or
mission variable to use for attrition application (student only or student and support). Compute
scheduled sorties or missions as required—sorties or missions divided by 1 minus the attrition
factor. For example, if Block 5a is 2,102 and Block 4f is 25%, 2,102 divided (1-.25) equals
2,803 sorties or missions. NOTE: For hourly UTE, compute as hours planned divided by the
ASD/AMD.
   A4.5.1. Block 5a. The number of sorties or missions required to meet and/or maintain the
   cumulative and planned UTE rate for the month planned.
   A4.5.2. Block 5b. The number of sorties or missions the attrition factor will be applied
   against (paragraph 14.8).
   A4.5.3. Block 5c. Equals Block 5b (1 - Block 4f).
   A4.5.4. Block 5d. The sum of Blocks 5a and 5c.
A4.6. Forecast UTE Data (Block 6):
   A4.6.1. Block 6a. Required UTE data. The total number of flying hours required to meet
   and/or maintain the current annual plan and syllabus. Enter the required hours, sorties, or
   missions; UTE; and planned ASD/AMD.
   A4.6.2. Block 6b. Scheduled UTE data (requirement plus attrition). Number of flying
   hours scheduled to be flown. Then enter scheduled hours, sorties or missions, UTE, and
   ASD/AMD.
A4.7. Sortie Breakdown (Block 7). Monthly plan as follows:
   A4.7.1. Block 7a. Local sorties or missions scheduled, separated by student, support, and
   total.
   A4.7.2. Block 7b. Off-station sorties or missions scheduled, separated by student, support,
   and total.
   A4.7.3. Block 7c. FCF, ferry sorties, or missions scheduled, separated by student, support,
   and total.
   A4.7.4. Block 7d. Total sorties or missions scheduled, separated by student, support, and
