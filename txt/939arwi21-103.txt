PURPOSE: This 939th Air Refueling Wing Instruction (ARWI) establishes procedures for performing
functional check flights (FCF) in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Man-
aging Aerospace Equipment Maintenance, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Management, Air Force Reserve Command Instruction (AFRCI) 21-101, Aircraft Mainte-
nance Guidance and Procedures, and Technical Order (T.O.) 1-1-300, Acceptance Functional Check
Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks. This instruction delineates the controls established for
safely accomplishing an FCF. It applies to all 939th Maintenance Group (MXG) aircraft maintenance per-
sonnel and aircrew members in the flying squadrons of the 939th Operations Group (OG).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision changes unit designation from 939th Rescue Wing to 939th Air Refueling Wing. A bar ( | )
indicates revision from the previous edition.


1. FCF Requirements:
   1.1. An FCF is performed to determine whether an aircraft and its various components are function-
   ing according to predetermined specifications while subject to a flight environment. Conditions
   requiring an FCF are specified in the applicable –6 technical orders for the KC-135. FCF requirements
   may also be mandated by time compliance technical orders (TCTO). Additionally the wing com-
   mander and logistics group commander through the maintenance superintendent or quality assurance
   (QA), may direct an FCF be performed for conditions or maintenance actions not specified in the –6
   technical order.
   1.2. An FCF crew brief is required for each FCF, unless the aircraft is down for adjustments or minor
   maintenance that is performed in conjunction with the FCF.

    1.3. All FCF crews will be debriefed at the end of the day’s flying to maintain continuity of the pro-
    gram. The FCF checklist will be retained by QA. If the same crew continues the FCF a short brief will
    be held in QA prior to the first flight of the day. A new crew will receive a complete brief.
    1.4. The operations group commander will ensure only FCF qualified crewmembers perform FCFs,
    IAW T.O. 1-1-300.
       1.4.1. The operations group commander or squadron commander will certify all FCF crewmem-
       bers. If a one-time flight authorization is required for any crewmember, the flight order will be
       signed by the operations group commander or senior ART. Individuals not specifically certified
       may be authorized on the flight orders (“Z” code).
       1.4.2. Maintenance personnel will not be carried on the aircraft unless they are required to per-
       form essential procedures or troubleshooting during an FCF. The operations group commander
       will approve all mission essential group personnel (MEGP) flown during an FCF.
       1.4.3. Safety will be the first consideration in FCF accomplishment. If an item cannot be safely
       accomplished, it will be deferred until a safe environment is assured.

2. Responsibilities and Procedures Prior to FCF. The following procedures will identify the individ-
ual responsibilities of all work centers/sections involved with the FCF process.
    2.1. Operations group commander will:
       2.1.1. Ensure procedures are established to create a safe FCF environment.
       2.1.2. Ensure FCF aircrew members are properly certified.
       2.1.3. Approve the FCF areas. (See Attachment 1 for maps of approved areas.)
       2.1.4. Coordinate for improvements to safe flying operations with the operations group stan/eval
       (OGV) and MXG/QA.
    2.2. The aircraft commander will brief the crew to ensure:
       2.2.1. Compliance with Go-No-Go procedures.
       2.2.2. Knowledge of the FCF requirements for the flight.
       2.2.3. Knowledge of the FCF procedures for the flight.
       2.2.4. Understanding of the local FCF area.
       2.2.5. Compliance with weather requirements for the flight as specified in T.O. 1-1-300.
    2.3. Crew Chief will:
       2.3.1. Have the appropriate FCF entry placed into the discrepancy block of the Air Force Techni-
       cal Order (AFTO) Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Contact QA
       for the job control number (JCN) for the FCF entry.
       2.3.2. Prepare the aircraft for flight, and review the aircraft forms to ensure all required mainte-
       nance/servicing is completed. The production superintendent will be responsible for reviewing the
       aircraft forms before they go to QA. The maintenance superintendent will review the aircraft
       forms if an FCF is required after ISO/phase. Inspection flight chiefs, if required, will accompany
       the crew chief to QA for the aircrew FCF brief.

       2.6.2. After being notified by QA inform the FCF crew QA is ready to brief the FCF.

3. Procedures During FCF. All events that require the application of or reduction of power to the air-
frame (other than that required for normal flight to get to/from the FCF area) will be accomplished within
the designated FCF area.

4. Procedures After FCF:
   4.1. FCF aircrew will report to QA for FCF debrief after the last flight of the day with the FCF check-
   list, aircraft forms and any technical orders used to perform the FCF.
   4.2. QA will:
4                                                                      939ARWI21-103 1 APRIL 2003


       4.2.1. Debrief FCF aircrew, review FCF checklist, and aircraft forms to determine if all FCF
       requirements have been complied with. If the FCF is not complete ensure the FCF checklist and
       aircraft forms are updated to the current aircraft status. The debrief should collect enough informa-
       tion to be able to brief the next FCF aircrew on the status of the aircraft and the FCF checklist.

    5.2. Quality assurance will provide training and handbook for the assigned QA representative.

6. OCF Procedures:
    6.1. An FCF Checklist will be used and items requiring an OCF will be identified.
    6.2. OCFs will be flown by experienced aircrews (not required to be an FCF qualified aircrew) and
    will be accomplished following the same maintenance criteria as FCFs. The crew for each OCF will
    be determined on a case by case basis. Fly OCFs when an operational check is not listed as a –6 FCF
    requirement and when either of the following conditions exist:
       6.2.1. Test equipment does not exist to perform the operational check on the ground.
       6.2.2. An in-flight operational check is required.
