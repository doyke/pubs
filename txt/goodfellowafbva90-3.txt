Notes: 1) Unacclimatized workers should be closely monitored for 2 weeks.
Refer to AFPAM 48-151 for further guidance. 2) Add 10° F to current WBGT
if wearing ground crew ensemble, fire fighting gear, or other
restrictive/impermeable clothing. 3) Add 15° F to current WBGT if wearing
combat armor.
    Remember: Supervisors are responsible for employee safety! Work
 outdoors during coolest parts of the day and ensure cool water and shade
are available. Factors contributing to heat stress: fever, alcohol use, lack of
                    sleep, medication, and dehydration
