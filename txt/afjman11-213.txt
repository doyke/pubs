                                                Chapter 1
                                      GENERAL PROCEDURES

1.1. Methods of Submitting Flight Data. There are two methods of submitting flight data into the
national air traffic system: by automated teleprocessing and by voice. The primary method of processing
this data is through the automated Service B telecommunications system. Service B is part of the
National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN). This network provides DoD base operations
with the capability to send and receive flight plans and related air traffic messages between worldwide US
military base operations, Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC), and FAA Flight Service Stations
(FSS). At base operations where voice procedures are used, flight data is submitted by interphone direct
to the FAA FSS. Voice procedures are specified in attachment 3. The lead DoD agency for this program
is Headquarters Air Force Flight Standards Agency (HQ AFFSA/XVA).
    1.1.1. Equipment Provided. Continental United States (CONUS) military base operations are
    equipped with state-of-the-art equipment for sending and receiving air traffic messages. This equip-
    ment is leased by the FAA and provided for DoD use. Procedures on equipment usage are found in
    publications issued to and available at base operations. If equipment must be moved, the circum-
    stances describing the move must be provided, in writing, to the DoD Service B Program Manager
    (HQ AFFSA/XVA) 90 calendar days before requested move date.
    1.1.2. System Circuitry. Military base operations are provided with a dedicated circuit (or dial
    access) through which all messages are transmitted. Message traffic is automatically processed
    through the FAA switching centers and distributed according to address coding. Therefore, messages
    must be prepared according to the instructions provided in this publication. Incorrectly prepared mes-
    sages will be rejected and the originator subsequently notified.
    1.1.3. NADIN Switch. Two NADIN switching centers, one in Atlanta GA and one in Salt Lake City
    UT, monitor and control the Service B system. DoD bases east of the Mississippi River and in the
    Minneapolis ARTCC area are connected to NADIN Atlanta. Bases west of the Mississippi, except
    those in Minneapolis ARTCC are connected to NADIN Salt Lake City. These switching centers have
    the capability to selectively monitor any message and will reject unauthorized messages. DoD facili-
    ties will use this communications system and equipment for authorized air traffic messages only.
    Examples of nonacceptable materials are:
        • Classified messages or material.
        • Unnecessary or anonymous signals or correspondence.
        • Personal messages. Its use for unauthorized messages may be grounds for disciplinary action.
            Since each base is on a dedicated circuit, circuit control will immediately know the originator
            of the transmission.
    1.1.4. Equipment/Circuit Problems and Rerouting Traffic. When an equipment outage occurs or
    is anticipated, the involved facility will immediately notify its ARTCC who in turn will notify the
    appropriate NADIN switch (Atlanta NADIN 404-946-7675 or Salt Lake City NADIN 801-539-3172)
    of the situation. If base operations personnel are unable to transmit data, they will ask an adjacent
    facility to make the notification. NADIN will initiate action to reroute traffic to the tie-in FSS. Base
    operations personnel will also notify the local ARTCC and contractor repair facility. The appropriate
    800 telephone number is 1-800-336-1551 when communicating with the repair facility. Base opera-

     tions personnel will report outages in excess of 24 hours to the Service B Program Manager, DSN
     858-4779, HQ AFFSA/XVA, 1535 Command Dr, Suite D309, Andrews AFB MD 20331-7002.

1.2. Message Format (General). There are several different formats used for transmitting air traffic
control and movement messages. Although each type of message is explained in detail, certain entries are
common to each message (figure 1.1).

                             DEPARTURE NOTIFICATION MESSAGES

2.1. Base Operations Responsibility. Immediately after a departure, base operations personnel will sub-
mit a flight notification departure message to the next point of landing (figure 2.1). If this facility is not a
full Service B location, submit the message to the destination tie-in FAA FSS. Initial departure messages
will contain, as a minimum:
    • Type of flight plan
    • Aircraft identification
    • Type aircraft
    • Departure point
    • Destination
    • ETA
    • Remarks; e.g., coded data pertinent to services, passengers, or cargo. In the absence of remarks,
         enter the letter "N" (meaning none) in the remarks field. When an FSS is an addressee precede
         remarks with a dollar sign ($).
NOTES:
1. The remarks section will include items applicable to that segment of flight. Enter "AERO CLUB" for
those aircraft assigned to a base AERO CLUB. EXAMPLE: VFR N214MC C172 BLV BYH 1630 S
BLV AERO CLUB.
2. For civil aircraft enter users name and landing permit number, which should be indicated on the DD
Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or FAA 7233-1, Flight Plan. (Obtain FAA Form 7233-1 from any FAA
Flight Service Center.) Remember the pilot is required to enter this information as stated in his or her
landing permit authorization letter. EXAMPLE: WOODALL HAF 900001C.
3. Destination station base operations will check the monthly Civil Aircraft Landing Permit Report to
verify permit currency. User name will be listed by individuals last name or company first name, such as
Admire, Mark A = Admire and Crown Central Petroleum Corp = Crown.

2.2. Sample VFR Departure (Flight Notification) Messages:
    2.2.1. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) One Way. Only the destination station will be addressed (or the
    tie-in FSS if the destination is not a full Service B location). When the FSS is an addressee, remarks
    must be preceded by a dollar sign ($) to allow automatic processing by AFSS.


EXAMPLE:

(Destination Barksdale     (To BAD Tie-in FSS,
AFB)                       De Ridder FSS)
These messages transmitted from Randolph base operations to Barksdale base operations or De Ridder
FSS (BAD service B out) indicate: Type flight plan, aircraft call sign, aircraft type, departure point, des-
tination, and estimated time of arrival (ETA) (including en route delays).
    2.2.2. VFR Stopover Departure (Flight Notification) Messages. Address messages to all base
    operations or FSSs having tie-in responsibility for the different points of intended landing. Separate
    stopover legs by a slant (/) at the end of each leg except the last. Before the slant, include remarks and,
    if the message is addressed to DoD base operations only, include the proposed departure time applica-
    ble to each leg. Place remarks that apply to the entire route at the end of the message. Begin each
    stopover leg as a new line. The first leg will show ETA to the first stop. The additional legs will show
    estimated time en route (ETE) between legs. Enter a void time as a last line item.
NOTE: Although shown in the following example, an FAA FSS is not required to include a proposed
departure time from stopover points in Departure Notification Messages:
EXAMPLE:
          /B
          FF SKF BSM HLR
          071400 KNGPYXYX
          VFR R23467 UH1 NGP SKF 1532 P1600/
          BSM 0+30 P1730/
          HLR 1+50
This message, transmitted by Corpus Christi Naval Air Station base operations, indicates stopovers at
Kelly and Bergstrom AFBs with the destination being Fort Hood. To calculate the void time, take the
total time from takeoff to final destination, rounded to the next whole hour.
    2.2.3. VFR Departure (Flight Notification) Message from Stopover Point. En route stations are
    responsible for sending departure notices when an aircraft departs their location.
EXAMPLE
AFJMAN11-213 26 AUGUST 1994                                                                      9

         FF BSM
         071600 KSKFYXYX
         R23467 D1605
This message sent by Kelly AFB to Bergstrom AFB indicates the aircraft departed at 1605.
   2.2.4. VFR Arrival and Cancellation Messages. When an aircraft arrives at its destination and an
   arrival or cancellation message has been requested, follow the following example:
EXAMPLE:
         /B
         FF RND
         072020 KHLRYXYX
         R23467 RND A2015 HLR
This message sent by Ft Hood Army Airfield to Randolph AFB indicates an arrival at 2015.

2.3. Sample Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Departure (Flight Notification) Messages:
   2.3.1. IFR One Way. The same elements used in a VFR departure notice will be used in an IFR
   departure notice, except the type of flight will be shown as IFR.
EXAMPLE:
IFR One Way (C-9 Air Evacuation (EVAC) Andrews AFB to Plattsburgh AFB):
         /B
         FF PBG
         281421 KADWYXYX
         IFR E116 C9 ADW PBG 1430
Spoken, this departure message would read: "IFR, EVAC one one six, C9, Andrews to Plattsburgh, ETA
1430."
   2.3.2. IFR Stopover. An example of a message of a C-21 from Andrews AFB to Plattsburgh AFB,
   Loring AFB, Logan Intl, TF Green State, Newark, Andrews AFB, Wright-Patterson AFB, and Scott
   AFB follows:

          FFO 0+50 A5O N/
          BLV 0+40 DP A5O SMITH
Andrews base operations sends this departure notification message to Plattsburgh base operations, to
Loring base operations, to Bridgeport Connecticut (services Logan Airport and TF Green State Airport),
to Millville New Jersey FSS (services Newark New Jersey), to Wright-Patterson base operations, and to
Scott base operations. The message also indicates that service is required at Loring AFB and Boston
International (Intl), and a USAF code 5 M/Gen (A5) who requests no assistance (O) will be on loaded at
Andrews AFB and offloaded at Scott AFB. See chapter 4 of DoD FLIP (General Planning) for VIP codes.
Proposed times from each stop may be included if the message is between DoD base operations.
NOTE: AP is used at onload station to depict passenger pickup. DP indicates passenger deplaning sta-
tion.
     2.3.3. Departure From Stopover Point. When the aircraft departs from a stopover point, base oper-
     ations personnel at the stopover location will send a departure notice to the next destination.
EXAMPLE:
          /B
          FF LIZ
          281615 KPBGYXYX
          TUG11 D1605

          081945 KNGPYXYX
          IFR VV27548 C9 NGP NIR 2104 P2130/
          VFR RND 0+45 S P2220/
          IFR NBE 1+10

2.5. Other Departure Notices. It is not practical to provide examples of every possible departure notice.
It is important however, to use the format specified above. If the departure message becomes involved,
such as in the case of tactical missions that originate as formation flights and return as single ship, do not
hesitate to use clear text to explain the mission more completely.

   3.1.5. Delay En Route Flight Plans. A delay en route flight plan normally requires a separate mes-
   sage for each leg of flight. The following examples indicate a departure from Randolph AFB with ter-
   minal area delays, for approaches, at San Angelo, Texas, at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, and an arrival
   back at Randolph AFB. Such a flight plan requires three messages:

     3.1.6. Instrument Route (IR) Flight Plan. IFR flight plan messages indicating IR usage will
     include the entry and exit fixes in the route of flight and entry and exit times plus MARSA in the
     remarks.

The remarks that indicate route entry and exit times will be formatted in consecutive sequence, without
spaces.
   3.1.7. Short Notice IFR Flight Plan Messages. If the IFR flight plan indicates a time en route of 30
   minutes or less to the first stop, identify the destination as an addressee on the IFR proposal message.
EXAMPLE:

3.2. Altitude Reservations (ALTRV):
   3.2.1. CONUS. Flight plans that include ALTRV information in CONUS airspace are processed to
   the FAA ARTCC by the Central Altitude Reservation Facility. Base operations should not resubmit
   to the CONUS ARTCC that portion of the flight plan, DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, that con-
   tains an ALTRV being flown in US airspace.
       3.2.1.1. If the ALTRV starts at the originating base, that is the aircraft is on an ALTRV immedi-
       ately after departure, base operations personnel do not submit an IFR flight plan proposal mes-
       sage. The ARTCC performs all actions.
       3.2.1.2. If the ALTRV is initiated or begins en route, use the following procedure:
           3.2.1.2.1. The originating base operations submits a flight data message specifying the fix
           where the ALTRV begins, followed by the amount of time required to fly from the ALTRV
           entry point to the ALTRV exit point, followed by the exit point and remainder of route.
           EXAMPLE: flight plan route to (entry point) ABC 136050/D02+00..XYZ (exit point) and
           flight plan route to destination. This base operations message is similar to the message used to
           show a delay en route at altitude. The ALTRV duration, or delay time, is determined from the
           ALTRV approval message.
           3.2.1.2.2. Local procedures should ensure base operations personnel understand the ALTRV
           entry point, ALTRV delay time and exit point. The remarks section of the flight data message
           should specify the point where the ALTRV is joined and the ALTRV name. EXAMPLE:
           JOIN DING BAT1 ALTRV at ABC 136050.
   3.2.2. International Flight Plans. The ALTRV must be included in the International flight plan DD
   Form 1801, International Flight Plan, when the entire ALTRV takes place outside CONUS air-
   space. Base operations personnel will ensure that the ALTRV is included in the IFR flight data mes-
   sage (FPL) sent to the CONUS ARTCC computer. If the ALTRV begins in CONUS airspace and
   extends into another country’s airspace, base operations personnel will have to transmit two flight plan
   messages. The first flight plan message will be submitted in domestic format using the procedures
   above and sent to the CONUS ARTCC computer. The flight plan will also be sent to all addressees
   except the ARTCC computer.
   3.2.3. Summary:
16                                                                 AFJMAN11-213 26 AUGUST 1994

        3.2.3.1. If the ALTRV is all in CONUS airspace, do not include ALTRV as part of the flight plan
        message. Include the ALTRV entry and exit points and ALTRV duration in the text of the IFR
        flight plan message. Identify the ALTRV in remarks.
        3.2.3.2. If the ALTRV is all in international airspace, include the entire ALTRV in the route of
        flight. Identify the ALTRV in remarks.
        3.2.3.3. If the ALTRV begins in CONUS airspace and continues into international airspace, two
        messages are required:
            • Send one IFR flight plan proposal message (domestic format) as in 3.2.3.1. above.
            • Send the second message in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) format to
                all addressees.

NOTE:
The local ARTCC may have requirements that amend the above directions. Base operations personnel
must work closely with the ARTCC to ensure a mutual understanding of ALTRV procedures exists.

3.3. Canceling or Amending Messages. Flight plans previously submitted to the CONUS ARTCC
computer may be amended by an amendment message (AM) or canceled by using a remove strip (RS)
message until 30 minutes before the proposed departure time. After 30 minutes before the proposed
departure time, base operations personnel must call the ARTCC for manual coordination.
     3.3.1. AM Message. The AM message (figure 3.2) is used to modify, add to, or delete previously
     filed flight plan data. When accepted, the amendment information becomes a part of the flight plan
     data base. An AM is user-generated and is different than a correction message (CM) which is sent to
     respond to an error message generated by the ARTCC computer. If Field 02 (aircraft identification) is
     to be amended, no other field may be amended in the same AM. If Field 02 and other fields are to be
     amended, send a RS message (figure 3.3) and reenter a corrected flight plan.

           121900 KRNDYXYX
           RND1827055 AM HUNT12 02 HUNT33
In this message, the change applies to "field two", aircraft identification. Spoken, it would read "Hunt
field two, is amended to read Hunt 33."


EXAMPLE:

This message cancels the stored flight plan for Army 12345. NOTE: If there is more than one flight plan
on an aircraft, operating in the same ARTCC, the RS message must contain the call sign and location of
the aircraft that is being canceled. The message text will read: BLV1652147 RS R12345/LRF, or another
example: GSB2313091 RS CHIEF41/ILM037070.

3.4. Error and CMs. Errors in IFR flight plan proposal messages are identified by the FAA computer
and a rejection message is generated to the originator. Base operations uses a CM to provide the correct
information.
   3.4.1. Sample Error Message:
Base operations sends the following IFR proposal message:
          /B
          FF ZSE
          121200 KTCMYXYX
          TCM1800031 FP LK04 F106/P 05000 TCM P1700 400\
          TCM..PDX/0030
The computer sends the following error message to base operations:
          FF KTCMYXYX
          121220 KZSEZQZX
          ERROR 031 05 SPD 05000
This message tells you that base operations message 031, field 05 (air speed) is in error.
   3.4.2. Base operations CM. This is the only time when base operations personnel will repeat a mes-
   sage number-field 00.
EXAMPLE:
          /B
          FF ZSE
          121225 KTCMYXYX
          TCM1800031 CM 500


NOTES:
1. The ARTCC computer stores or holds an erroneous flight plan for a specified period of time. This
period varies between ARTCCs, but normally is no longer than 10 minutes after computer receipt. If base
operations personnel do not transmit a CM within the time frame established by the ARTCC, the entire
flight plan must be resubmitted.
EXAMPLE:
Computer Message: ERROR 070 10 RTE..FLACK..FIX NOT STORED CM: TCM1908070 CM
..FLAAK..
2. IFR proposed flight plan messages that contain errors and are sent to ARTCC computers outside or
beyond the local ARTCC may not be identified back to the originator. The message originator will
receive a normal ARTCC computer acknowledgment and a rejection message will be identified at the
ARTCC receiving the proposal. EXAMPLE: Ft Campbell KY (served by Memphis ARTCC) sends an
IFR proposal message to Jacksonville ARTCC on an aircraft stopping over at Cairns AAF. This message
20                                                                  AFJMAN11-213 26 AUGUST 1994

has an error in the route of flight. The Jacksonville ARTCC computer will acknowledge the message
back to Ft Campbell and a rejection message will be printed out in Jacksonville center. If the IFR mes-
sage was sent to the wrong center, that ARTCC may generate a message back to originator indicating the
error. The originator is then responsible for transmission to the correct center.

3.5. ARTCC Computer Acknowledgment Messages. When a flight plan message is accepted by the
ARTCC computer, an acknowledgment or "Roger" will be received as follows:
EXAMPLE:
          FF KRNDYXYX
          121320 KZCHZQZX
          R002
Houston ARTCC computer (KZCHZQZX) acknowledges Randolph AFB (KRNDYXYX) IFR Message
number 2.

3.6. ARTCC Computer Identifying Number (CID). The CID is an automatic numbering system gen-
erated by the ARTCC computer. When a base sends an IFR flight plan message (e.g., LRF2100003) and
the message is correct, the ARTCC computer "Rogers" the message by sending the base "R003." At the
same time, the ARTCC computer assigns an in-house CID. If several IFR messages are sent on the same
aircraft, as is the case with the stopover flight plan, each message is assigned a CID. Base operations per-
sonnel are unaware of the CID but they may need the information under certain circumstances.
EXAMPLE:
DUMP 55 is a C-130 operating out of Little Rock AFB on a stopover flight plan all within the Memphis
ARTCC control area. The stopover flight plan route is Little Rock AFB to Eaker AFB to Little Rock AFB
to Memphis. Little Rock AFB sends three messages:
          LRF0700002 (originating at Little Rock AFB)
          LRF0701003 (stopover at Eaker AFB)
          LRF0703004 (stopover at Little Rock AFB)
Approximately 45 minutes before original departure, Little Rock base operations wants to amend the filed
altitude of the stopover leg from Little Rock to Memphis. Little Rock base operations sends the following:
          LRF1015012 AM DUMP55/LRF 09 260
The ARTCC computer looks for DUMP 55 and finds two flight plan messages on DUMP 55 out of Little
Rock AFB. The computer sends this message to Little Rock AFB:
          ERROR 012 02 AID DUMP55 FILD DUPLICATION
          LRF P1100
          BYH P0930
          LRF P0800
This error message translates to: Error message 012, Field 02, aircraft identification (AID) DUMP 55
has more than one (duplication) flight plan message on file. The computer message then identifies all the
AFJMAN11-213 26 AUGUST 1994                                                                              21

messages on DUMP 55 using CID numbers, departure point, and proposed time. Now base operations
can amend the stopover leg out of Little Rock AFB using the CID (070): LRF0715010 AM 070 09 260.

3.7. Stereo Flight Plan. A stereo flight plan is used to activate a route of flight that is prestored in the
ARTCC computer. The flight plan message may be entered with the stereo identification as the only field
10 entry. The departure location (field 06) must agree with the stereo departure point. Variations from
these procedures do occur within some centers. Letters of agreement must be established between base
operations and the applicable ARTCC. Sample stereo entry:
          /B
          FF ZAB
          192300 KABQYXYX
          ABQ1230025 SP TACO21 A7/P 450 P1530 300 LOLA36
Field two must read SP. If it reads FP then a computer error message, message too short, will be trans-
mitted to the originator.

3.8. System Saturation. If the telecommunications system becomes saturated so that you cannot deliver
your IFR proposed flight plan messages, revert to these alternate procedures:
    • Immediately verify with the ARTCC what the problem is.
    • Coordinate with the center and telephone in your immediate IFR proposals; that is, those that are
       proposed for departure in less than 30 minutes. Other IFR proposals will be voiced to the local
       FSS.
    • Avoid sending duplicate messages via the telecommunications system.
    • Voice call all your message traffic, including departure notices, to the FAA FSS.
    • Notify your local flying organizations and ask them to submit their flight plans well in advance of
       the departure time.

                              MILITARY TRAINING ROUTES (MTR)

4.1. MTR Policy. Flight plans that indicate flights along MTR require special handling. Flight plan fil-
ing lead times and submission times to the ARTCC, as outlined in the FLIP Document, must be adhered
to.

4.2. Scheduling Requirements. MTRs are scheduled in advance. Instrument Routes (IR) and Visual
Routes (VR) cannot be used without being scheduled. Unit scheduling organizations "owning" these
routes provide base operations (with Service B capability) or the tie-in FSS with a daily schedule of route
usage. Base operations personnel do not schedule these routes but will issue the scheduled usage to all
FSSs, ARTCCs, and other base operations within 100 NM of the training route (see FLIP Document AP/
1B). Messages will include route identifier, time of use, and altitude involved. (NOTE: Slow-speed,
low-altitude training routes are not to be transmitted, briefed on, or posted). FAA FSS and ARTCCs are
not required to acknowledge MTR schedules. While scheduling flexibility is necessary, local procedures
should ensure that changes 2 hours before scheduled departure are held to a minimum.

         ICAO FLIGHT PLAN HANDLING (FAAH 7110.10, CHAPTER 7, SECTION 1)

5.1. ICAO IFR Flight Plans (FPL). Address FPL messages to the ARTCC servicing the airport of
departure using the three-letter ARTCC identifier and to all air traffic units providing air traffic control
service (not including CONUS air traffic units). Transmit all IFR FPL proposals to the ARTCC not less
than 1 hour before the proposed departure time. Dashes "-" and both open and closed parentheses "( )" are
required functions included in an IFR ICAO FPL message. Messages must adhere to ICAO standards,
submitted in the exact format ( figure 5.1) and be free of errors. ICAO FPL proposal messages will not be
automatically acknowledged by the ARTCC computer. A voice call will be required to verify receipt of
an FPL or AM. (See FLIP General Planning for additional information regarding ICAO FPLs.)

Latitude and Longitude - Degrees Only (Seven Characters). Two figures describing latitude in degrees,
followed by "N" (North) or "S" (South), followed by three figures describing longitude in degrees fol-
lowed by "E" (East) or "W" (West). Insert zeros, where necessary to compile the correct number of fig-
ures; e.g., 46N078W. (Do not separate latitude and longitude by a slash "/".)
Latitude and Longitude - Degrees and Minutes (11 Characters). Four figures describing latitude in
degrees and minutes followed by five figures describing longitude in degrees and minutes followed by
"E" (East) or "W" (West). Insert zeros where necessary, to makeup the correct number of figures; e.g.,
4620N07805W. (Do not separate latitude and longitude by a slash "/".)
Bearing and distance from a navigation aid. The identification of the navigation aid (normally a VOR), in
the form of two or three characters, then the bearing from the aid in the form of three figures giving
degrees magnetic, then the distance from the aid in the form of three figures expressing nautical miles.
Insert zeros where necessary, to makeup the correct number of figures; e.g., a point 180 degrees magnetic
at a distance of 40 nautical miles from VOR "DUB" would read DUB180040.
13-Aerodrome of destination and Estimated Elapsed Time (EET), preceded by a dash; e.g., -MPHO0415.
14-Alternate Aerodrome. Enter ICAO identifier, one space after EET.
15-Other information, preceded by a dash; i.e., -0 indicates no other information (note after this entry the
right parentheses, ")", must be inserted to complete the message). If additional information is added, use
one of the following abbreviations, a slash and the appropriate information in plain text or accepted abbre-
viation. If there are no remarks, indicate 0; i.e., -0). Do not use a dash within the text of the remarks.
EET and significant points or FIR boundary designators and accumulated elapsed time to such points or
boundaries.
REG/. The registration marking of the aircraft, if different from the aircraft identification above.
SEL/. SELCAL Code, if so prescribed by the appropriate Air Traffic Service (ATS) authority.
OPR/. Name of the operator, if not obvious from the aircraft identification.
STS/. Reason for special handling by ATS; e.g., hospital aircraft or one engine inoperative, e.g., STS/
HOSP, STS/ONE ENG INOP.


TYP/. Type(s) of aircraft, preceded if necessary by number(s) of aircraft, such as for a formation flight.
PER/. Aircraft performance data, if so prescribed by the appropriate ATS Authority.
COM/. Any additional COM equipment carried.
NAV/. Any additional NAV equipment.
DEP/. ICAO 4-letter location indicator of the location of the Air Traffic Services (ATS) unit from which
supplementary flight plan data can be obtained, if Air File (AFIL) is inserted in item 13.
  RMK/. Any other plain language remarks when required by the appropriate ATS authority as deemed
necessary.

5.2. Stopover Flight Plans. While multiple stopover flights are not authorized on the DD Form 1801,
separate flight plan forms for subsequent legs of flight may be filed at the first departure aerodrome. The
originating base operations will transmit the first flight plan message to the ARTCC controlling the depar-
ture point. Separate messages for the other legs may be transmitted by the originating base operations to
the base operations at each intermediate stop. Base operations, in receipt of this flight plan information,
will transmit the data to their local ARTCC facility. EXAMPLE: McGuire base operations receives
ICAO flight plans for a flight with intermediate stops at Lajes Field, Mildenhall RAF, and terminating at
Ramstein AB. McGuire AFB sends the initial leg (McGuire to Lajes) to New York ARTCC for initial
clearance. They then transmit to Lajes base operations, the flight plan from Lajes Field to Mildenhall
RAF, and to Mildenhall base operations, the flight plan from Mildenhall AFB to Ramstein AB. Upon
28                                                                  AFJMAN11-213 26 AUGUST 1994

receipt, Lajes Field and Mildenhall RAF will submit the appropriate flight plan to their air traffic control
facility.

5.3. ICAO Departure Message. Base operations personnel at the originating station will send all ICAO
departure notification messages (figure 5.2.). Messages will be sent to the same agencies addressed in
the FPL message not including the originating ARTCC.

                                    TRANSBORDER MESSAGES

6.1. General Information. Air traffic messages between the United States, Canada, and Mexico are con-
sidered transborder messages. Military bases that experience difficulties in processing flight data to Can-
ada should contact the Seattle FSS; for Mexico contact the San Antonio FSS. These facilities will provide
guidance, as necessary.

6.2. Canada Transborder Messages. Military base operations will transmit VFR and IFR departure
notification messages concerning aircraft landing in Canada. Canadian FSSs will acknowledge VFR
departure messages but normally do not acknowledge IFR departure messages.
   6.2.1. Flight plans must indicate a designated airport of entry as point of destination.
   6.2.2. Transmit flight notification messages in the following format:

6.3. Mexico Transborder Messages. Mexico requires notification of an inbound aircraft before its
arrival. Transmittal of a flight notification message with "ADMISA" (Advise Customs and Public Health
Services) in the remarks is one method of satisfying this requirement.
     6.3.1.   Transmission of flight notification message will consist of the following items:
         •    Aircraft identification.
         •    Aircraft type.
         •    Departure time.
         •    Departure point.
         •    Destination..
         •    Estimated time en route.
         •    Remarks:
     ADMISA, number of persons aboard, nationality, and pilot's name (if customs notification
     requested).
     REQ ACK (request acknowledgment).
EXAMPLE:
              /B
              FF MMMYYFYX
              091540 KSKFYXYX
              A48750 C141 D1535 SKF ADN 0305 ADMISA 5US JACKSON REQ ACK
     6.3.2. The departure station is responsible for Search and Rescue (SAR) action until an acknowledg-
     ment is received from Mexico. If an acknowledgment is not received within 30 minutes of transmis-
     sion time, the flight notification message should be retransmitted to the destination station and to
     Mexico City (MMMXXMOW), which will then send an acknowledgment to the departure station and
     assume responsibility for the message.
AFJMAN11-213 26 AUGUST 1994                                                                              33

  6.3.3. As some Mexican facilities operate on a part-time basis, do not request SAR operations for
  overdue aircraft unless the destination confirms that the aircraft has not arrived or circumstances indi-
  cate that an accident may have occurred. Make inquiries to the destination station and Mexico City
  when an acknowledgment has not been received within 2 hours of the aircraft’s ETA, provided this is
  within the hours of operation of the destination station.
  6.3.4. If no reply is received within 1 hour after the inquiry is transmitted or if the reply is negative,
  initiate preliminary communications search actions and transmit an information request (QALQ) mes-
  sage to stations along the route within the United States.
  6.3.5. If preliminary communications search actions are not successful, notify your tie-in FSS and ask
  for their assistance. Maintain suspense files of all unclosed flight plans until the aircraft is located,
  even though this may be for an indefinite period.

                                         OVERDUE AIRCRAFT

8.1. Agency Responsibilities. Overdue aircraft communications search responsibility is shared between
the DoD and FAA. The destination host base operations is responsible for preliminary communication
search activities, and the FAA destination tie-in FSS is responsible for all extended communication search
actions.
     8.1.1. Destination Base Operations. If an inbound aircraft (including aircraft flying locally and
     round robin) has not arrived or communications cannot be established within 30 minutes after ETA,
     the destination host base operations will initiate preliminary communications search actions.
         • Contact local air traffic control agencies. (This action frequently resolves questions regarding
             IFR aircraft.)
         • Initiate a ramp check.
        •    Check adjacent airports.
        •    If 1, 2, or 3 above fails to ascertain the aircraft's whereabouts, transmit a "QALQ" message to
             the original departure station and to each point of intended landing:
EXAMPLE:
            /B
            FF SPS
            091543 KSKFYXYX
          QALQ N2821Z
        • Notify the destination tie-in FSS, by voice, of the overdue aircraft and the preliminary com-
           munications search actions taken.
     8.1.2. Action by Departure Station. Upon receipt of a QALQ inquiry, the departure station will
     complete a ramp check and local communications search for the aircraft. This action should be com-
     pleted within 15 minutes. If the aircraft is located, send the following message to the destination base,
     the destination tie-in FSS, and the controlling ARTCC:
EXAMPLE:
            /B

          (FEXHA is defined as fuel exhaustion time).
NOTE: At this point, the FAA assumes responsibility for all overdue aircraft communications (extended
communications search). The military base operations will continue to cooperate with the tie-in FSS, as
may be required.

8.2. Extended Communications Search. Although the FAA is responsible for extended communica-
tions search activity, the military base operations may be in receipt of communications search traffic that
will require a response. As a result, the following information is provided: (Ref: FAAH 7110.10, chap 8).
   8.2.1. Information Request (INREQ) Message. If the reply to the QALQ is negative, or if the air-
   craft has not been located within 30 minutes after it becomes overdue (1 hour after ETA), the FAA
   will:
       • Transmit a numbered INREQ message to the departure station, flight watch stations with
           communications outlets (see FAA M14 charts) along the route, other FSSs along the route,
           and the Rescue Coordination Center. If these stations are within 50 miles of the Great Lakes,
           also transmit the INREQ to the Cleveland FSS.
       • Include all information in the INREQ message that will assist in search activities.

NOTE: INREQ messages are also addressed to ARTCCs along the route of flight and the Air Force Res-
cue Coordination Center-KRCCYCYX. An eight-letter identifier must be used when sending to the RCC.
   8.2.2. INREQ Action Upon Receipt. All stations in receipt of an INREQ are required to take some
   type of action.
       8.2.2.1. Departure Station will hold the INREQ message in suspense.
       8.2.2.2. En Route Stations will seek information about the aircraft:
           •   Check operational records.
           •   Check airports in their area.
           •   Check local Air Traffic Control agencies and initiate a ramp check.

     8.2.3. Alert Notice (ALNOT) Message. ALNOT messages are sent 1 hour after transmission of the
     INREQ message, or upon FEXHA time, whichever comes first (if all inquires to the INREQ were
     negative).
        8.2.3.1. ALNOT messages contain all items of the INREQ plus any information received as a
        result of the INREQ inquiries.
        8.2.3.2. ALNOT messages are addressed with priority indicator of "SS".
        8.2.3.3. The FAA calls the RCC at Scott AFB 10 minutes after issuance of the ALNOT to assure
        delivery and to answer any inquiries.
        8.2.3.4. ALNOTs are addressed to all Service B circuits serving the ALNOT search area plus the
        RCC.

NOTE:
ALNOTs are not numbered.
     8.2.4. Receipt of ALNOT Action. Upon receipt of an ALNOT, each station whose area extends into
     the ALNOT search area will:
        8.2.4.1. Immediately conduct a communications search of those airports. That could accommo-
        date the aircraft and were not checked during the INREQ status. Notify originator of search
        results within 1 hour of receipt. Use a numbered message.
        8.2.4.2. Deliver ALNOT information to adjacent terminal facilities.
        8.2.4.3. Request appropriate law enforcement agencies to check airports which could not be con-
        tacted, otherwise.
        8.2.4.4. Request search assistance from aircraft traversing the search area.
        8.2.4.5. Suspense ALNOT until canceled.
     8.2.5. Cancellation of INREQ or ALNOT. INREQs will be canceled by the originator of the mes-
     sage. ALNOTs are canceled by the RCC or the facility that originated the message. When informa-
     tion is received indicating an aircraft arrival, cancellation, extension of flight plan, or information that
     the aircraft has been located, the INREQ/ALNOT originator will transmit a cancellation message.

       CVS001035..CVS0445 : TANKER BLAST 41
     A3.2.10.13. VFR Element. Used when an aircraft is proceeding IFR to a fix and then VFR or
     VFR to an IFR pickup point. NOTE: The ARTCC computer stops processing whenever it reads
     VFR. EXAMPLE: Aircraft is going from New Orleans to Randolph AFB. The pilot files VFR to
     CRP and then IFR. The route of flight will read CRP.V163.THX..RND (Flight Plan remarks will
     indicate: VFR Departure). EXAMPLE: Aircraft files IFR to SAT then VFR to COT:
     HLR..AUS.V17.SAT.VFR.COT.
     A3.2.10.14. Stereo Routes. A stereo route must specify the identification of a prestored flight
     plan. The flight plan message may be entered with the stereo identification as the only Field 10
     entry. The stored data will automatically replace the stereo identification when received at the
     ARTCC.

        A3.2.10.15. Estimated Time En Route (ETE). Consists of an element separator (/) and four
        digits applicable to the destination: CVS/0445.
     A3.2.11. Field 11 Remarks. This is an optional field. Data in this field are separated from Field 10
     by a space and is limited to air traffic control remarks.
         • Full Route Clearance (FRC) will be added to the flight plan remarks any time the route of
            flight transmitted to the ARTCC is different than the route the pilot filed. This action requires
            the ARTCC controller to issue an FRC to the pilot, thus eliminating any possible confusion.
            When used, FRC must be the first remark in Field 11.
         • The overcast symbol, represented by a question mark (?) on the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)
            keyboard, is followed by the remarks applicable to the ARTCC controlling the departure
            point.
         • The clear weather symbol, represented by a colon (:) on the CRT key board, is followed by the
            remarks applicable to all ARTCCs through which the flight transits, including the originating
            ARTCC.
