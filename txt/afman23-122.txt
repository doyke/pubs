MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C

SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFMAN 23-122, Materiel Management Procedures

       By order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Guidance Memorandum implements new
requirements regarding the acceptance of serialized control assets under the Found on Base
(FOB) Turn-in Procedures into AFMAN 23-122, Materiel Management Procedures 8 August 2013.
To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein
prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

        The change is being made to allow overages of serialized control (i.e. NWRM, CCI/COMSEC,
weapons) or classified assets, generated only as a result of directed deactivations and/or modifications, to
be processed as a FOB turn in when proper documentation is provided.

       This memorandum will be implemented in the published version of AFMAN 23-122 as
coordinated and approved in this memo. The approved language will be inserted in the current published
AFMAN 23-122 (Chapter 6).

        This memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum,
or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication, whichever is earlier.

Para 6.2.3 and process the return with TEX code “+”. Serialized control assets (i.e. NWRM,
CCI/COMSEC, Weapons) or classified assets need to follow actions identified under Table 6.2.
All research actions and/or maintenance documentation will be filed with a copy of the D20
(BASE SUPPLY SURVEILLANCE REPORT) in accordance with AFI 23-101 (5.5.7.11). Use
table 6.2 for additional actions.

(Added) 6.2.2.5.3. Overages. Overages resulting from maintenance turn-ins due to scheduled
weapon system deactivations and modifications shall be considered resolved discrepancies when
maintenance activities provide documentation directing the deactivations and or modifications as
justification for resolution. The supply activity will add the items to the item record via a turn-
in/receipt transaction, and documentation will be filed with Document Control in accordance
with AFI 23-101 (5.5.7.11). For NWRM assets, notify the NTCC
(635SCOW.NTCC@us.af.mil) prior to processing for accountability and disposition instructions.
If documentation cannot be provided, the overages will be considered unresolved and the
requirements prescribed in Table 6.2. will be followed.

                                    GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Section 1A—Purpose, Scope and Description of Manual

1.1. Purpose, Scope and Description of Manual.
     1.1.1. Purpose and Scope. The purpose of this manual is to further implement direction
     provided in AFPD 23-1 and AFI 23-101. This guidance provides directions for performing
     predominantly retail materiel management processes associated with determining stock
     requirements, inventorying, storing materiel, cataloging, ordering, sourcing, receiving,
     delivering, and return/disposal of materiel for Class IX repair parts and select Class VII
     major end items as identified and approved by Headquarters AF (HAF). Additionally,
     guidance for other classes of supply is covered in specific subject areas. These references
     will be specifically enumerated where applicable.
     1.1.2. Supplementation and Waiver Authority. This instruction may be supplemented no
     lower than the Major Command (MAJCOM) level unless otherwise indicated. MAJCOMs
     supplementing this instruction must coordinate with AF/A4LM and will follow guidance in
     AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. All waiver requests to this instruction
     must be approved by the certifying official of this instruction.
     1.1.3. Description. This manual has the same construct as AFI 23-101 and AFH 23-123,
     Vol 2, Pt 1. While not all sections within AFI 23-101 have associated procedures enumerated
     in AFMAN 23-122, those sections where procedures are detailed have the same section titles.
     In a similar manner, where applicable, sections have the same titles in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
     1. For example, Sec. 5D, Equipment Management is the same section in AFI 23-101,
     AFMAN 23-122, and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
        1.1.3.1. Users are encouraged to refer to Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 for reference
        information as well as identification of legacy AF supply chain functions with updated
        terminology.
        1.1.3.2. The Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) system is the overarching term
        used to describe the system(s) used by base retail materiel management operations. The
        ILS-S is comprised of the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), Enterprise Solution –
        Supply (ES-S), and the Air Force Supply Centralized Database (AFSCDB). In many
        cases the term ILS-S is used to identify system related functions/references. Where
        applicable, in some instances, specific identification of SBSS or ES-S is used for more
        detailed identification.

Section 1B—Organizational Structures & Responsibilities

1.2. Organizational Structures & Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. Change of Accountable Officers (AOs).
        1.2.1.1. Purpose: To explain the Change of AOs process. For policy specific
        requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      7


     1.2.1.2. When the AO of an accountable Department of Defense Activity Address Code
     (DODAAC) is replaced by a newly designated AO the following actions will be
     performed:
        1.2.1.2.1. Complete a 100% inventory of NWRM for FB accounts with NWRM IAW
        Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and Inventory Adjustments, prior to transfer of
        accountability.
        1.2.1.2.2. The installation/ wing commander or equivalent with approving official
        input will determine if conditions exist which would preclude relief from
        accountability or require board/survey action against the officer before the present
        AO is relieved from accountability. If applicable, refer to AFMAN 23-220, Reports
        of Survey for Air Force Property.
        1.2.1.2.3. Process the consolidated inventory adjustment document register as the
        record of activity for FB account transfers. See Consolidated Inventory Adjustment
        Document Register in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. Note: Material Management IT
        system queries will not be used as the official tool to perform this function.
            1.2.1.2.3.1. The Materiel Management Flight will initiate a certificate of transfer
            for the account. See Figure 1.1 for FB accounts and Figure 1.2 for transfers of
            FB account with NWRM.
     1.2.1.3. For other than "FB" account transfers refer to Figure 1.3 If other guidance
     outlines transfer of accountability actions, it may be used in lieu of Figure 1.3 (e.g. "FK"
     munitions account transfers will refer to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions
     Maintenance Management for appropriate guidance.) Note: Contractor managed
     accounts must have a government AO appointed. The government AO can either be the
     functional area chief, quality assurance evaluator, or other appointed government
     individual who is qualified in the appropriate AFSC. These procedures apply to the
     transition of these AOs as well.

Section 1C—Satellite Operations

1.3. Satellite Operations.
   1.3.1. Satellite Relocation (Re-home).
        1.3.1.1. Purpose: Satellite accounts are moved from one computer support base (CSB) to
        another for satellite support for a variety of reasons: to improve support, to accommodate
        additional satellite accounts at the host base, to relieve a host base of too many accounts,
        to arrange new support when a base closes, etc. The process has to be exact. Strict
        management control and cooperation from all activities involved are necessary. In this
        section, timeline requirements, monitoring responsibilities, and reporting requirements
        are covered. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
        guidance use AFH 23-123.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    11


     1.3.1.2. General Procedure: For a satellite account to be relocated, certain specific
     procedures are required. The transfer procedures discussed here allow for an orderly
     transfer, and they apply to all activities involved in relocation. These procedures must be
     accomplished in the order presented, and MAJCOMS must supplement with directives
     needed for special requirements.
         1.3.1.2.1. Time Requirement. Plan to start relocation actions 90 days before the
         relocation schedule date, unless the major command in coordination with the AFMC
         SCM-R Computer Operations Activity elects to complete the procedure in a shorter
         period.
         1.3.1.2.2. The LRS CC/AO, AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity and
         Accounting & Finance officers at both the gaining and losing bases will appoint
         representatives to monitor the transfer process.
         1.3.1.2.3. Transfer. After down-loading procedures are completed, the AFMC SCM-
         R Computer Operations Activity and LRS CC/AO have the responsibility of
         transferring all output to the gaining CSB responsible for uploading the records.
         1.3.1.2.4. Points of Contact. Good communication is the key to a successful rehome.
         Primary and alternate points of contact at both the gaining and the losing bases and
         AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity must be identified. Each individual
         selected as a point of contact must have a good working knowledge of the rehome
         process. Recommend that the points of contact be selected from Functional Systems
         Management Section (LGLOS) or equivalent.
         1.3.1.2.5. Reporting Requirements. Notify the Standard Systems Group control
         room, HQ AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, DSN 596-5771, prior to
         the rehome download and when the rehome has been completed. The gaining CSB or
         AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity reports the beginning of upload and
         notifies AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity when upload is completed.
         Any problems with hardware, procedures, or software will be reported by means of
         normal procedures. When difficulties are encountered in efforts to resume normal
         operations, satellite parent command, CSB gaining command, and AFMC SCM-R
         Information Technology Activity will be kept informed.
  1.3.2. Satellite Relocation (Re-home) Sequence for Pre-Relocation Actions.
     1.3.2.1. Purpose: To provide a recommended schedule for planning satellite relocation
     (re-home) beginning 90 days before the completion date. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use Satellite Rehome
     Sequence for Pre-Relocation System Processing in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 1.
     1.3.2.2. The following actions will be performed:
         1.3.2.2.1. 90 Days before Relocation.
            1.3.2.2.1.1. LGLOS personnel at the losing CSB will contact the gaining CSB
            LGLOS, the A&F officers of both CSBs and the satellite relocation monitor and
            establish a relocation plan.
         1.3.2.2.2. 30 Days before Relocation.
12                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             1.3.2.2.2.1. The losing CSB will identify unique account attributes such as P item
             records, organization and shop codes and system designator information.
         1.3.2.2.3. 20 Days before Relocation.
             1.3.2.2.3.1. The gaining command will request an address change from AFMC
             SCM-R Information Technology Activity for the losing CSB to the gaining CSB.
         1.3.2.2.4. 15 Days before Relocation.
             1.3.2.2.4.1. The losing CSB will establish a cutoff date in conjunction with the
             planned removal of communication lines.
         1.3.2.2.5. 10 Days before Relocation.
             1.3.2.2.5.1. The losing CSB will send a list of standard reporting designators
             (SRDs) used by the satellite to the gaining CSB/ AFMC SCM-R Computer
             Operations Activity. The gaining CSB will load all the SRDs that are applicable.
             1.3.2.2.5.2. The satellite will develop a letter of agreement with the gaining
             CSB/AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity.
         1.3.2.2.6. 2 Days before Relocation.
             1.3.2.2.6.1. The losing CSB will provide the gaining CSB Interchangeable
             Substitute Groups (ISG) clean up information.
         1.3.2.2.7. 1 Day before Relocation.
             1.3.2.2.7.1. Ensure all satellite processing has stopped.
         1.3.2.2.8. Day of Relocation.
             1.3.2.2.8.1. Execute necessary ILS-S transition programs.
  1.3.3. Establishing a Satellite Account.
     1.3.3.1. Purpose: This section describes the procedures used to establish (also known as
     conversion) a satellite account. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and
     for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     1.3.3.2. Preconversion/Conversion Requirements.
         1.3.3.2.1. Formal Agreements. When a satellite account is established, a formal
         agreement about responsibilities may be considered between the account and the host
         base. This agreement may be in the form of a support agreement written according to
         the regulations contained in AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements, a contract, or a formal
         MOA.
         1.3.3.2.2. Time Requirements. Pre-conversion actions are normally time phased from
         a period of 120 days prior to conversion. However, the 120-day lead time may be
         compressed or expanded as mission dictates. All functions scheduled to establish a
         satellite account use the basic procedures contained in this section.
         1.3.3.2.3. Reporting Requirements: The new host CSB or AFMC SCM-R Computer
         Operations Activity notifies the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity at
         DSN 596-5771 when the upload begins and when the upload is complete. Normal
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   13


        procedures are used to report to the major command and the AFMC SCM-R
        Information Technology Activity any problems with hardware, software, or
        procedures.
        1.3.3.2.4. GSD SMAG Operating Program. The gaining major command is
        responsible for notifying HQ AFMC/FMRS of an anticipated move or conversion, the
        date of the move or conversion will take place, and any pertinent information on the
        major command involved.
        1.3.3.2.5. Notification of Conversion. The gaining major command is responsible for
        notifying certain agencies when a host or satellite account is established. The gaining
        major command will:
            1.3.3.2.5.1. Submit a letter/message to the AFMC Allowance Standard Activity
            advising them of the pending conversion and requesting any known address
            changes. Note: Notify AFMC Allowance Standard Activity only if the account is
            type E.
            1.3.3.2.5.2. Send a message to DLA Transaction Services(DLATS), Wright-
            Patterson AFB, Ohio, advising them of any SRAN changes and the type of
            accounts affected (for example, FB, FG, FP, etc.).
     1.3.3.3. Satellite Account Pre-Conversion/Conversion.
        1.3.3.3.1. Refer to Satellite Rehome Sequence for Pre-Relocation System Processing
        in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 1 for the programs/processes needed to support Pre-
        Conversion and Conversion.

                                            PLAN

Section 2A—Overview

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines steps for the materiel management processes associated
with demand and supply planning for base retail operations. These activities include Stockage
Policy procedures; Financial Management; WRM; Degraded Operations; and Readiness Spares
Packages and Kits; Contingency/ Wartime Planning.

Section 2B—Stockage Procedure

2.2. Stockage Procedure.
   2.2.1. Readiness Based Leveling.
       2.2.1.1. Purpose: Describe the procedures and transactions used to implement and
       maintain centrally computed Readiness Based Levels. For policy specific requirements
       refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123.
       2.2.1.2. General Readiness Based Level (RBL) procedures. A Readiness Based Level is
       a centrally computed quantity pushed from the Air Force RBL (D035E) system. When
       RBL levels are established in the ILS-S, the RBL quantity becomes the peacetime portion
       of the total base requirement and the base stock level.
       2.2.1.3. RBLs are demand-based levels and are identified in the ILS-S with Type Level
       Flag F and “A007PL” in the first six positions of the document number. See Guide To
       Assigning The Type Level Flag (TLF) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for a list of type
       level flags. The RBL process was designed to allocate the AFMC-computed worldwide
       peacetime requirements among AF bases and depots in a way that minimizes worldwide
       expected backorders.
       2.2.1.4. Contractor Inventory Control Points (CICP) are responsible for total item
       management including the requirements computation and setting and updating base stock
       levels. Wholesale contractor ICPs may use RBL, their own unique leveling system, or a
       combination of both in managing item stock levels.
       2.2.1.5. Computing RBLs involves both item usage during pipeline times and worldwide
       requirements data. Base item usage data are provided to the RBL (D035E) or Contractor
       Inventory Control Point (CICP) central leveling system via electronic reports.
       AFMC/CICPs can also send bases electronic requests for usage data when the RBL
       system has not received an updated base daily demand report/percent base repair report in
       over 90 days. The RBL process uses base specific data to determine the optimum
       allocation of the worldwide requirement. The following actions will be performed:
          2.2.1.5.1. RBL is processed quarterly at AFMC for both the base and the depot. The
          computation is performed during the third week of the first month of each quarter.
          Generally, the system will allocate a stock level to all worldwide users. However,
          there is no guarantee that each user will receive a positive level, because even though
          a base may have sufficient demands to establish a demand level in the ILS-S, the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  15


        AFMC-computed worldwide peacetime requirement may not be sufficient to allocate
        a positive level to every base. Therefore, the system could allocate a stock level of
        zero to a base. An exception applies to selected Communications-Electronics (C-E),
        space, and missile (non-airborne) items that are managed under the Low Density
        Level (LDL) process. For LDLs, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity LDL
        manager consolidates MAJCOM-approved levels, creates a flat file and sends it to
        AFMC to be loaded into the RBL system each quarter. The LDLs are then honored
        via RBL push levels even if the sum of the LDLs exceeds the worldwide requirement.
        2.2.1.5.2. The RBL system contains special rules for honoring Contingency High
        Priority Mission Support Kit (CHPMSK) requirements. When approved by
        AF/A4LM, CHPMSK levels are loaded at contingency (deployment) locations and
        supported by the source of supply. CHPMSKs support long term (over 90 days)
        contingency needs. To accommodate the CHPMSK requirements, RBL subtracts the
        CHPMSK authorized quantity from the worldwide peacetime requirements before
        any RBL allocations are made. Therefore, the additional CHPMSK quantity that will
        be requisitioned by the contingency location will be offset by reductions in RBL
        allocations to all worldwide users of the CHPMSK items.
        2.2.1.5.3. AFMC and CICPs communicate centrally computed RBLs sent via
        centrally computed level transactions. See Readiness Based Level (RBL) Procedures
        and Transactions in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for specific details and input
        format for centrally computed level transactions. The RBL will always be sent to
        bases on the AFMC master NSN for items in an interchangeable and substitute group
        (I&SG) or on a bachelor NSN for items that are not in an I&SG.
  2.2.2. Customer Oriented Leveling Technique (COLT).
     2.2.2.1. Purpose: Describe the procedures used to implement and maintain COLT. For
     policy specific requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
     COLT Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
     2.2.2.2. General Customer Oriented Leveling Technique (COLT) centrally computes
     levels for Budget Code 9 items that have an established demand pattern at a base. The
     following paragraphs describe the methodology for setting and implementing COLT
     stock levels.
     2.2.2.3. The COLT process was designed to set base stock levels on DLA-managed
     items in a way that minimizes base-wide unit customer wait time (CWT) per dollar spent.
     CWT considers both the number of items issued immediately and backordered (as does
     issue effectiveness) as well as the duration of the backorders to provide a complete
     measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of the levels. COLT is generally designed to
     produce base stock levels that are cost-neutral with respect to the ILS-S demand leveling
     process. The COLT process described in COLT Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
     Ch 2 was initially developed and tested in 2003, and approved for Air Force wide
     implementation in 2005.
     2.2.2.4. The Air Force COLT team obtains base-level data from the Air Force centralized
     database for input to the COLT model. The COLT model develops stock levels one base
     at a time; finding the optimum levels. A review of the output is performed by the AF
16                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     COLT team. Time is provided in the process for the AFMC SCM-R Weapon System
     Support Activity, MAJCOMs, or bases to optionally review the output to ensure level
     accuracy. The AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity /MAJCOM/base may
     decide to exclude some items from receiving levels based on local conditions (e.g.,
     improper coding of HAZMAT items). The final COLT levels are then sent to the ILS-S
     using XCA transactions. They are implemented in the ILS-S via RBL transactions
     described in RBL Procedures and Transactions, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. No
     special level request documentation approval/submission is required for COLT items.
     2.2.2.5. COLT levels are computed once a quarter for each base. To spread the
     workload, COLT computes levels for one-third of the bases each month of the quarter.
        2.2.2.5.1. Quarterly-computed COLT levels are only pushed to bases when the new
        level differs from the existing base stock level by more than the square root of the
        existing level. Note: Increases in levels for items with Mission Impact Code (MIC) 1
        will always be pushed regardless of the difference from previous levels. This is the
        same as the ILS-S rule and is designed to reduce level volatility. See COLT
        Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for additional explanation.
     2.2.2.6. There are a number of constraints (level caps) in COLT to control the depth of
     leveling. Like the ILS-S computed demand levels, the economic order quantity (EOQ) is
     capped at one year's demand quantity as is the COLT reorder point (ROP). These caps
     are designed to prevent over stocking.
        2.2.2.6.1. COLT stops leveling when the Expected Backorders (EBOs) are less than
        0.0027; preventing leveling where there are minimal gains. COLT supports the use
        of the Shelf Life Code (SLC); capping levels at half the shelf life quantity.
        2.2.2.6.2. Stockage Priority Code (SPC) 5 items are capped at the existing on hand
        balance. This allows COLT to maintain a level on these items (and prevent
        backorders), while keeping the system from buying more stock until there are
        subsequent demands. If there are subsequent demands, the SPC code will be
        upgraded, allowing the resumption of full COLT leveling. The final cap calls for the
        total COLT level to be capped at $4K (if the ILS-S demand level = 0) or $5K more
        than the ILS-S demand level (if the demand level > 0). COLT will sometimes provide
        significantly more depth of levels than the current ILS-S demand level.
        2.2.2.6.3. COLT has several rules that restrict the levels. There is an initial leveling
        rule in COLT to prevent initially stocking an item when the chance of a future
        demand is small. COLT logic limits stock levels for Individual Equipment (IEU)
        items (Federal Stock Group 84 and Federal Stock Class 4240) and HAZMAT items
        (IEX 9). To accommodate MAJCOM policies, COLT only provides levels on these
        items if ILS-S demand level > 0. COLT will not stock any item with a Max Level of
        0 or an SPC of E. In addition, there are exclusion/zero lists maintained by the AF
        COLT team, modified by the MAJCOMs/ AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support
        Activity, which excludes items in identified federal stock classes at identified bases
        from receiving positive levels.
        2.2.2.6.4. The ILS-S programmatically assigns mission impact code (MIC) 1 to items
        that have previously caused a MICAP at that base. Therefore, all COLT candidate
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    17


         items will receive a positive level on MIC 1 items, except for those MIC items with
         an SPC 5 and no on-hand serviceable balance.
         2.2.2.6.5. COLT has other rules to modify levels. COLT uses the Mission Change
         details and Base Closure Flags to modify demand and leveling for changing missions.
         COLT has a bench stock/RSP rule where it considers other inventory on a base as
         partially available to help avoid backorders. Finally, COLT has special logic to
         determine levels for the AMC Forward Supply Locations.
     2.2.2.7. Refer to COLT Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for further details
     associated with COLT transaction processing.
  2.2.3. Proactive Demand Levels (PDL).
     2.2.3.1. Purpose: Describes the procedures used to generate and communicate PDL to
     base level. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.2.3.2. PDL is used to compute levels for items that have no demand history or
     extremely low historical demands. The goal of PDL is to reduce the number of MICAPs
     for Material Management IT systems non-stocked items.
     2.2.3.3. PDL Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 describes the methodology
     for setting and implementing PDL.
  2.2.4. Mission Change Data.
     2.2.4.1. Purpose: To explain the mission change data (MCD) procedures process. For
     policy specific requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
     AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
     2.2.4.2. The mission-change process is designed to alter base stock levels for items
     applicable to a weapon system that is already assigned at the base that will be affected by
     a known “mission change.”
     2.2.4.3. A mission change is the addition or loss of a number of weapon system end
     items at a base or the base may be tasked to fly the same number of sorties, but increase
     or decrease the average sortie duration. The ILS-S can use the base historical SRD-based
     consumption data for the applicable weapon system and information about the mission
     change to adjust base demand, thereby adjusting the stock levels for the weapon system-
     applicable items. Consider an example in which the mission change process should be
     used. Suppose a base has 24 F-16C aircraft assigned and is going to receive an additional
     12 aircraft in 6 months. The actions contained in Mission Change and New Activation
     Spares Support List Procedures, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 will be taken by the base
     to establish sufficient materiel management support for the increased number of aircraft.
     2.2.4.4. Reference Mission Change and New Activation Spares Support List Procedures,
     AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for further details associated with MCD transaction
     processing.
  2.2.5. Adjusted Stock Level Requests.
18                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     2.2.5.1. Purpose: To explain the general procedures for requesting and processing
     Adjusted Stock Level (ASL) Requests. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-
     101 and for IT specific guidance use refer to AFH 23-123.
     2.2.5.2. General. Activities may submit requests for ASLs to AFMC SCM-R using a
     digitally signed email. Where multiple individual items with same justification require
     ASLs, request may be submitted in a single correspondence. All required data must be
     included on the request, message or email. Repetitious data need only be provided once.
        2.2.5.2.1. NWRM adjusted levels are directed, loaded/changed/deleted by the
        NWRM Transaction Control Cell (NTCC), 635SCOW.NTCC@us.af.mil. All
        actions including required validations are performed by the NTCC.
     2.2.5.3. Requesting ASL’s. Customers requesting an ASL will provide detailed
     justification for all initial requests for negotiated levels to AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
     Activity. The justification must clearly indicate the reason for the request, and the
     expected period the level will be needed. The quantity requested should be the minimum
     essential quantity required to support the requirement.
        2.2.5.3.1. All ASL request will contain the following information at a minimum:
            2.2.5.3.1.1. National Item Identification Number (NIIN).
            2.2.5.3.1.2. Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) and Base Name.
            2.2.5.3.1.3. Owning Major Command. The owning major command is the parent
            command of the organization making the request.
            2.2.5.3.1.4. Quantity requested.
            2.2.5.3.1.5. Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) or Mission Design and Series
            (MDS) of supported weapons system.
            2.2.5.3.1.6. Item Part Number.
            2.2.5.3.1.7. Technical Order, Figure, and Index.
            2.2.5.3.1.8. Date the level is required to be in place.
            2.2.5.3.1.9. Estimated length of time the level will be needed.
            2.2.5.3.1.10. Reason for the         request   along      with   supporting   mission
            justification/documentation.
            2.2.5.3.1.11. Level Justification Code.
            2.2.5.3.1.12. For Low Density Levels (LDL), the following additional data is
            required:
               2.2.5.3.1.12.1. Lead Command of the supported Weapons System.
               2.2.5.3.1.12.2. Type of LDL level being requested:
                 2.2.5.3.1.12.2.1. Single Point Failure (SPF) Items. Single point failure items
                 are items whose failure will render a system inoperative and/or unable to
                 perform its designated mission. SPF items are pre-positioned to meet
                 specific mission requirements such as system restoration time of 48 hours or
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  19


                 less and warrants pre-positioning of a spare or storage at a designated
                 centralized storage location.
                 2.2.5.3.1.12.2.2. Operational Readiness Part (ORP) Items. Operational
                 readiness part (ORP) items do not fit the general definition of an SPF item.
                 However, range and depth of available weapon system inventory usually
                 warrants pre-positioning of the spare or storage at a supply point or
                 centralized storage location. These conditions require pre-positioning of
                 ORP items. Examples of ORP, a units’ unique (remote) location, a small
                 worldwide available inventory, or units with multiple system locations. ORP
                 items are required to maintain maximum redundant capabilities or a one-of-
                 a-kind system capability.
                 2.2.5.3.1.12.2.3. Joint Transfer Agreement (JTA) Items. Joint transfer
                 agreement (JTA) items are inter-Service C-E related and have been
                 authorized for pre-positioning by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). These
                 assets are required to be maintained on a supply point for the life of the
                 system.
                 2.2.5.3.1.12.2.4. Non-Prepositioned (NPP).       This encompasses        the
                 remaining LDL levels that do not mandate pre-positioning.
        2.2.5.3.2. All ASL requests will be sent to the appropriate AFMC SCM-R Weapon
        System Support Activity for an analysis/review. For Non-Weapon System related
        requests, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control will perform analysis/review. AFMC SCM-R
        will assess the need for the level and best placement throughout the enterprise to
        support the identified need. If other than AFMC SCM-R initiated, ASL requests that
        are not justified will be disapproved and/or returned without action to the initiator,
        with reason for disapproval. Disapproved requests will be returned through the same
        channels that submitted the request.
            2.2.5.3.2.1. The analysis/review responsibility includes the identification of
            plausible alternatives to the establishment of the ASLs. For example, recommend
            disapproval of the ASL request if the item can be obtained from a depot,
            purchased, or manufactured locally in time to satisfy operational requirements.
     2.2.5.4. Types of Approved Levels. ASLs will be categorized as Directed, Permanent or
     Temporary based on the reason and results of the analysis/review. See AFH 23-123, Vol
     2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for further guidance.
        2.2.5.4.1. Approved ASLs will be loaded using the most appropriate Reason Why
        Code (RWC) outlined in Guidelines For Assigning the RWC in AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
        Pt 1, Ch 2. If there is not a specific RWC for the situation, load the ASL with RWC Y
        and file all correspondence related to the approval of the level for future reference.
        2.2.5.4.2. Permanent Levels.
            2.2.5.4.2.1. When analysis/review determines the need for an ASL based on an
            indefinite period or critical mission requirement and the demands pattern will not
            warrant an RBL/COLT level, a permanent level will be approved using
            Sustainment Flag P.
20                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        2.2.5.4.2.2. Permanent Levels can be loaded as a Minimum, Maximum, or Fixed
        type level, as Type level flag C, D, and E.
        2.2.5.4.2.3. Permanent Levels will be reviewed upon changes in mission or
        activation/deactivation of major weapons systems.
            2.2.5.4.2.3.1. If review shows the level is no longer required or a lesser
            quantity is justified, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will process an
            Adjusted Stock Level Delete input to delete the level or Adjusted Stock Level
            Change input to adjust the authorized quantity.
            2.2.5.4.2.3.2. Use the Special Level Review Listing or comparable ILS-S
            Query to manage and or delete any Permanent Levels that need deletion.
     2.2.5.4.3. Temporary Levels.
        2.2.5.4.3.1. When a change in mission or new mission requirements justify the
        need for an ASL and the purpose for the level indicates that future demand will
        result in a self-sustaining level, AFMC-SCM-R Stock Control Activity will
        establish the level as a temporary level using Sustainment Flag T.
        2.2.5.4.3.2. Using Sustainment Flag T, process an Adjusted Stock Level Load or
        Adjusted Stock Level Approval Date Update input with a determined expiration
        date. The approval date will be computed by subtracting 730 days from the
        expiration date. This date will be entered on the Adjusted Stock Level Load or
        Adjusted Stock Level Approval Date Update transaction.
        2.2.5.4.3.3. Temporary Levels can be loaded as a Minimum, Maximum, or Fixed
        type level, as Type Level Flag A, B, D or E. In most cases, Temporary Levels
        should be loaded as Minimum to allow the ASL to be deleted or become Memo
        once the normal demand computation meets or exceeds the ASL.
        2.2.5.4.3.4. Use the Special Level Review Listing or comparable ILS-S Query to
        manage and or delete any Temporary Levels.
     2.2.5.4.4. Directed Levels
        2.2.5.4.4.1. Adjusted Stock Levels directed from higher levels are termed
        directed because the quantity, application, justification, and approval have already
        been determined.
        2.2.5.4.4.2. Directed Levels can be loaded with Sustainment Flag P or T as
        determined by the directing activity.
        2.2.5.4.4.3. All directed ASLs are established in the ILS-S as either a Minimum
        Memo ASL or Minimum, Maximum, or Fixed Firm ASL upon receipt. Any Type
        Level Flag can be used per the directing activity of the level request. See
        Adjusted Stock Level Load, Change, Delete Transaction (XE4) in AFH 23-123,
        Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for more information and processing directed levels
        loads/changes and deletes.
        2.2.5.4.4.4. Directed Levels will be reviewed upon changes in mission or
        activation/deactivation of major weapons systems.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    21


            2.2.5.4.4.5. If review shows the level is no longer required or a lesser quantity is
            justified, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will coordinate with directing
            activity on deletion/change of the ASL.
     2.2.5.5. The following actions will be performed when ASLs are disapproved:
        2.2.5.5.1. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity personnel will prepare an Adjusted
        Stock Level Delete input as prescribed in Adjusted Stock Level (ASL) Delete Input
        Format (1F3D), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 to delete the ASL detail record.
     2.2.5.6. ASL requests for AFMC-managed non-airborne Communications-Electronic (C-
     E), Space, Weather, Radar, and Missile Systems are submitted electronically (email) by
     the requestor to MAJCOM System Manager, and coordinated with AFMC SCM-R Low
     Density Level (LDL) Manager at: grounds.stockcontrol@us.af.mil.
     2.2.5.7. ASL Load to Interchangeable and Substitute Group (I&SG). AFMC-SCM-R
     Stock Control Activity personnel may load Minimum, Maximum, or Fixed ASL detail
     records to any item within an ISG. Moreover, AFMC-SCM-R Stock Control personnel
     may load multiple detail records to the same item or group when: (1) the ASL is required
     to support different end items; (2) support is required by different shops within the same
     organization; or (3) support is required by different base organizations.
     2.2.5.8. Guidelines for approving ASL requests are as follows:
        2.2.5.8.1. Approval of Budget Code “9” ASL Requests. ASLs established for budget
        code “9” ERRC "XB3" and "XF3" items can be established at the discretion of the
        AFMC SCM-R. Level of approval for all budget code “9” "XB3" and "XF3" items
        with an extended cost of less than $5,000 rests with the AFMC SCM-R. The AFMC
        SCM-R Weapon System Support and/or Stock Control Activity, in coordination with
        the AFMC SCM-R Stock Fund Activity, is the final approval authority for budget
        code “9” items for levels with an extended cost of $5,000 or more.
        2.2.5.8.2. Approval of Budget Code “8” ASL Requests. The Inventory Management
        Specialist (IMS) will act as the approval/disapproval authority for budget code “8”
        assets due to being funded with use of Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group
        (CASG) funds.
        2.2.5.8.3. Approval of Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) or Contractor
        Inventory Control Point (CICP) ASL Requests. The CSWS/CICP will act as the
        approval/disapproval authority for all CSWS/CICP managed items.
        2.2.5.8.4. Approval of remaining AFMC managed items not equal to Budget Code 8
        will be approved/disapproved at the discretion of the IMs.
        2.2.5.8.5. If AFMC SCM-R has not received a response from the Source of Supply
        on the status of an ASL request within 10 duty-days of submission, AFMC SCM-R
        may elevate or disapprove the request at their discretion.
        2.2.5.8.6. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity loads a memo detail level and
        retains a suspense copy pending approval/disapproval. After final approval has been
        coordinated, process the ASL load, change, update, or delete transaction. AFMC
        SCM-R Stock Control Activity enters the approval date based on the desired
        expiration date on the Adjusted Stock Level Load or Adjusted Stock Level Approval
 22                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         Date Update transaction. This action loads the approval date and establishes the ASL
         detail record as confirmed (FIRM). The suspense copy can be destroyed.
         2.2.5.8.7. For AFMC managed requests, do not process an Adjusted Stock Level
         Approval Date Update until an approval is received. If this input is processed before
         materiel manager approval, the materiel manager will return an ASL reject
         transaction with a reject code "R". See Adjusted Stock Level Load, Change, Delete
         Transaction (XE4) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. If this occurs, AFMC SCM-R
         must process an Adjusted Level Validation input with an asterisk in position 73 that
         blanks the approval date and changes the ASL detail from firm to memo.
         2.2.5.8.8. If an ASL Reject Notification is received from the materiel manager and
         there is an approved authorization on file, contact the appropriate materiel manager.
         Please refer to Adjusted Stock Level Load, Change, Delete Transaction (XE4), AFH
         23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for ASL Reject Notification transaction processing.
         2.2.5.8.9. New ASL requests will be reviewed for supportability for NSNs coded as
         Obsolete (AAC V or Y), AF Inactive, or NSNs assigned NPPC 2, 3, 5 or 9. If an ASL
         is required for this type of item, then the requestor must submit an AF Form 86 or
         coordinate with the IMS/ES at the owning AFMC Air Logistics Complexes to re-
         catalog the NSN. The new level may be approved after the AF Form 86 action is
         completed and the NSN is stock listed and procurable. ASLs are authorized for
         obsolete items with an active repair contract. These items are coded obsolete with no
         plans for future procurement; however they have an active repair contract to support
         the weapon systems. Note: Previously existing ASLs are authorized if an AF Form
         86 action has been submitted. However, when exception codes are loaded to prevent
         future usage, the special levels will be deleted.
         2.2.5.8.10. ASLs are not authorized for stock numbers with ERRC "ND" and "NF".
         Exceptions are TLF D Maximum Level Zero and Non-AFMC managed ERRC
         “NF1”.
   2.2.6. Exception Management
   2.2.6.1. Exception Codes
         2.2.6.1.1. Exception codes are assigned to item records when exception processing is
         necessary for the management of excesses, requisitions, shipments and issues.
         Personnel at the AFMC SCM-R AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will manage
         the exception code program. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity is responsible
         for all locally assigned exception codes. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2
         [EEX/SEX] and Ch 5 [IEX/REX] for exception code processing instructions.
      2.2.6.2. Exception Phrases
         2.2.6.2.1. Exception phrases are assigned to the ILS-S when exception processing is
         necessary for the management of excesses, issues, requisitions and shipments.
         Personnel at the AFMC SCM-R AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will
         manage the exception phrase program. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more
         information concerning exception phrase record creation and management.

Section 2C—Financial Management
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     23


2.3. Financial Management.
   2.3.1. Due-Out Obligation Procedures.
      2.3.1.1. Purpose: Explains how to obligate an organization’s Operation and Maintenance
      (O&M) funds on selected due-outs. Two basic methods are used to obligate due-outs:
      Due-out obligation flag and Due-out obligation/de-obligation transaction input 1DO. For
      policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
      23-123.
      2.3.1.2. The procedures described in this paragraph do not apply to TEX code 8
      equipment due-outs, TEX code H due-outs, or TEX code D due-outs.
          2.3.1.2.1. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity or AFMC (for accounts under the
          AFMC support) will turn on the due-out obligation flag in the base constants record
          in the appropriate ILS-S.
          2.3.1.2.2. When this flag is turned on, all customer due-outs will obligate when
          processed.
          2.3.1.2.3. Funds Requirement Card (FRC) or Special Requisition (SPR) inputs to
          firm unfunded due-outs will obligate if funds are available, and the requisition is to
          routing identifiers other than D(xx), JBR, or J(nn).
      2.3.1.3. Due-Out Obligation. This method does not check for funds availability and
      could lead to over-obligation of funds. If the previous year's O&M funds are to be
      obligated; the budget officer must also approve the use of this process. Refer to Due-Out
      Obligation/Deobligation Input (1DO) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for processing.
          2.3.1.3.1. If the fiscal year of obligation is blank, the customer due-out was firm and
          obligated before 30 September of the previous fiscal year, but because of an error the
          date of obligation is now blank. In this case, use the previous year Accounting and
          Finance (A&F) Stock Fund Due-Out Reports to obtain the fiscal year to be used with
          the Due-out Obligation transaction.
          2.3.1.3.2. When the due-out is incorrectly canceled, the customer due-out was
          obligated before 30 September of the previous fiscal year, but LRS/Materiel
          Management Activity personnel incorrectly canceled the customer due-out. In this
          case, reestablish the due-out with the same document number and the same fiscal year
          of obligation, as reflected on previous A&F Stock Fund Due-Out Reports.
          2.3.1.3.3. If an item record indicative data change rejects, it may be necessary to de-
          obligate the due-out, cancel the due-out, reestablish the due-out using the same
          document number, and obligate with the original fiscal year of obligation using Due-
          Out Obligation transaction.
          2.3.1.3.4. Any other circumstances not previously identified that cannot be resolved
          by the local budget office, warranting obligation of a due-out using prior fiscal year
          O&M funding, requires MAJCOM Budget approval with MAJCOM SMAG manager
          coordination prior to processing.
          2.3.1.3.5. An industrial funds organization is an organization that provides a service
          or product to another military service or government agency. Customers pay for these
24                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        services and products. AF activities that are industrially funded include
        Transportation Working Capital Fund (sales code 49), CSAG-Maintenance (sales
        code 63 series), and other AF industrial funds (sales codes 48, 62, 69). Because the
        funding for these services or products is not linked to a specific year of appropriation,
        due-outs for industrial funds items are always obligated with current year funds.
  2.3.2. Budget Code Z Investments.
     2.3.2.1. Purpose: To explain steps required before loading Budget Code Z item records.
     For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
     AFH 23-123.
     2.3.2.2. Once the budget code has been assigned, it usually is not changed until the end
     of the fiscal year. This prevents excessive changes between investment funds (major
     appropriations) and stock and/or Operations and Maintenance funds. AFI 65-601, Vol 1,
     Budget Guidance and Procedures, Ch 8, provides the criteria for determining whether or
     not an investment equipment item is authorized a budget code Z.
     2.3.2.3. Budget code Z is initially assigned to locally funded equipment items with a unit
     cost of $250,000 or more. These items are funded through one of three appropriations:
     major procurement appropriation for other procurement (57*3080); other RDT&E
     procurement (57*3600); or NIMA procurement (97*0300.4802). Two materiel
     acquisition control records are maintained for each System Designator (S/D). One will
     always be for procurement appropriation 57*3080. The second may be for other
     appropriations authorized by HQ USAF see Materiel Acquisition Control Record
     (MACR) Load, Change, Or Delete Input (1LM) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 to load
     MACR for Budget Code Z.
     2.3.2.4. The SMAG manager should review applicable records before submitting O&M
     budgets to the base budget office to allow for tentative budget code changes that will
     affect budget submissions for 57*3600 and/or 57*3080 appropriations and C-SAG
     Operating Program. 2.3.2.5. Coordination with Records Maintenance personnel to
     change budget code Z. For more information on assignment of Budget Code 9/Z
     reference Assignment of Budget Code 9 in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8.
  2.3.3. Validating WRM Funding Requirements.
     2.3.3.1. Purpose: To explain the validation process of Operational RSPs such as
     CHPMSK, HPMSK, IRSP, MRSP, and MSK funding request procedures process. For
     policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
     23-123.
     2.3.3.2. Overarching guidance for War Reserve Materiel Program is contained in AFI
     25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures.
     WRM/Readiness Spares Packages (RSP) Requirements (Q07/NGV848) required in direct
     support of CHPMSK, HPMSK, IRSP, MRSP, and MSKs are described in AFH 23-123,
     Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5.
     2.3.3.3. General validation process. WRM/RSP report is designed for use by
     bases/MAJCOMs to determine and identify WRM and Operational RSP shortages.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      25


        2.3.3.3.1. WRM obligation authority is a firm limitation that is fenced and cannot be
        exceeded. If requirement exceeds the approved obligation authority, WRM Global
        Manager M/AFMC must request additional funds from AFMC/FM.
        2.3.3.3.2. The WRM community must fund for procurement of new WRM funding
        requirements through the congressional budgeting Program Objective Memorandum
        (POM).
        2.3.3.3.3. When WRM items are used to satisfy MICAP requirements, these items
        are replaced with SMAG operating obligations authority. WRM items should be
        rotated with like peacetime assets to the extent possible to assure their continued
        serviceability. If however, WRM assets become unusable or outdated, replacement is
        considered an initial procurement of new WRM and must be acquired with GSD
        WRM obligation authority and identified to HQ AFMC on the GSD Operating
        Program for additional WRM funding. GSD only has obligation authority to purchase
        WRM when specifically provided with additional Stock Fund Contract Authority.
        2.3.3.3.4. The CSAG WRM obligation authority will be used to finance CSAG
        budget code 8. GSD SMAG obligation will be used to finance budget code 9 GSD
        RSP requirements. Assets will be maintained on detail records and are included in
        ILS-S inventory until they are consumed and expensed.
     2.3.3.4. When the SMAG Manager receives the WRM/RSP Q07 report, the following
     actions will be performed to validate requirements for WRM funding.
        2.3.3.4.1. Coordinate quarterly with LRS/LGRDX and outside agency RSP monitors
        for the host and satellite activities to validate unsupportable requirements.
        2.3.3.4.2. Coordinate quarterly with installation WRMO/NCO (LRS/LGRDX) and
        commodity WRM Managers (WRMM), for the host and satellite activities to validate
        unsupportable requirements.
        2.3.3.4.3. Correct erroneous details and remove the output or change it before
        submitting the file. Remove all outputs containing valid details for items that should
        not be funded immediately because of lack of storage space (for example, deicing
        fluid, engine oil, etc.) or local availability (liquid oxygen, demineralized water, etc.).
        2.3.3.4.4. Annually conduct WRM GSD budget call to obtain WRM requirements
        from WRM/BEAR GMs (ACC/A4RX) to be included in the GSD Program Budget
        Review (PBR) to AFMC/FM.
           2.3.3.4.4.1. Submit the Approved Operating Budget (WRM funding requirement)
           to HQ AFMC/FMR for inclusion in the Budget Estimate Submission (BES) sent
           to SAF/FM.
           2.3.3.4.4.2. AFMC/FM gathers requirements from MAJCOM and includes in
           their PBR submission to SAF/FM.
           2.3.3.4.4.3. Based on Command War Reserve Materiel Officer/Non
           Commissioned Officer (CWRMO/NCO’s) POMs, SAF/FM will determine if
           O&M funds are approved for purchasing initial WRM assets. If O&M is
           approved, SAF/FM will provide AFMC/FM the additional stock fund authority
           for distribution to MAJCOMs.   Note: CWRMO/NCO’s that did not identify
26                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            WRM requirements in their POM will not receive WRM GSD funds.
         2.3.3.4.5. Budget execution for GSD begins with SAF/FM by annual funding
         distribution to AFMC/FMR, down to the SMAG Manager, who distributes to the
         bases where GSD WRM funds are executed.
            2.3.3.4.5.1. WRM obligation authority received by MAJCOMs from AFMC/FM
            will be distributed to bases with requirements identified and a POM submitted by
            CWRMO/NCO under PEC 28031 and/or 41135.
            2.3.3.4.5.2. Load funding when WRM GSD is received and identify to the WRM
            Global Managers (ACC/A4RX) base SRAN and GSD amount available for
            spending. Note: Funding is provided by priority and dollar value for the assets
            identified on the last Q07 processed.
            2.3.3.4.5.3. Load obligation authority to MACR Update Code (MUC) 21 in GSD
            Materiel Acquisition Control Record (MACR).
            2.3.3.4.5.4. The SMAG Manager will load funding and notify the host or satellite
            RSP monitors. Note: Funding is provided by priority and dollar value for the
            assets identified on the last Q07 processed.
            2.3.3.4.5.5. Track the spending of the WRM obligation authority and report back
            to AFMC/FM when spending is completed.
  2.3.4. Apportionment Control.
     2.3.4.1. Purpose: To explain control of appropriations procedures. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.3.4.2. Total Financial Authority (TFA) consists of obligation and commitment targets
     for operating and War Reserve Materiel (WRM). These targets will be loaded to the
     MACR, to support requisitions placed with supply sources (see DFASDE 7077.10-M,
     Standard Base Supply System User’s Manual, for MACR update logic). Targets for
     obligations are limitations that cannot be exceeded.
     2.3.4.3. General appropriations. The approved annual ratio of operating obligations plus
     credit returns to gross sales must be achieved in order to generate cash from sales to
     support stock replenishment requirements. Achievement of the approved ratio also aids in
     the control of SMAG outlays. Reference Unit Cost Ratio (UCR) Impacts in AFH 23-123,
     Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for items that impact the unit cost ratio.
     2.3.4.4. AOB provides approved credit returns, gross sales, obligations, and an approved
     ratio of operating obligations plus credit returns to gross sales (unit cost ratio).
     2.3.4.5. During periods of constrained funding, MACR factors must be applied in order
     to operate within financial limits imposed. The SMAG managers must continually
     monitor the financial targets and actual ratio in order to avoid an Anti-Deficiency Act
     violation. The following actions will be performed:
         2.3.4.5.1. MAJCOMs will distribute AOB to the SMAG managers.
         2.3.4.5.2. Operating obligations will be computed using the worksheet provided in
         AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   27


        2.3.4.5.3. SMAG Managers must develop an operating program at the lowest
        management and operating level.
        2.3.4.5.4. Initial development is performed at base level and is reviewed and
        consolidated at command and division level.
        2.3.4.5.5. Manage data appropriate to specific inventory and capital control
        objectives are selected from these financial reports see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch
        2.
        2.3.4.5.6. Compare this data with the approved objectives of the operating program
        in order to determine the status of the SMAG.
  2.3.5. SMAG MACR Controls.
     2.3.5.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures for MACR factor development and control.
     For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
     AFH 23-123.
     2.3.5.2. General Procedures. Unlike the OCCR, Project Funds Management Record
     (PFMR), and Stock Fund Inventory Management Record (SFIMR), which are for data
     collecting and reporting, the MACR serves the purpose of control. The MACR is used to
     adjust or prevent the automatic requisitioning of materiel. Also, the MACR is used to
     change or prevent requisitions undergoing normal computer processing.
     2.3.5.3. Maximum automatic obligation values, MACR factors, and Urgency Need
     Designator (UND) Codes are used as control data for requisitioning. You can load
     modifications of these values at any time, but use caution. Remember that the maximum
     automatic obligation for replenishment and due-outs cannot be loaded for less than $50.
     2.3.5.4. Four control parameters are available in the MACR record:
        2.3.5.4.1. Urgency of need funding flag.
        2.3.5.4.2. Maximum automatic obligation for due-outs.
        2.3.5.4.3. Maximum automatic obligation for stock replenishment.
        2.3.5.4.4. MACR factors.
     2.3.5.5. The use of MACR factors is preferable during mission changes and other events
     (such as MAJCOM changes in stockage levels or changes in supply levels dictated by
     local authority) that make demand patterns hard to predict. But keep in mind that with use
     of the MACR factors, there is an increased workload, both for depots and for the
     Distribution Section. Using the MACR factor also increases the chance of out-of-stock
     conditions and more customer due-outs. For these reasons, use the MACR factors only
     when necessary.
     2.3.5.6. The following actions will be performed:
        2.3.5.6.1. Compute the value of requisitions you anticipate making for the remainder
        of the fiscal year. Reference AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2, Example of MACR
        Factor Development to determine factors to use in the MACR.

Section 2D—War Reserve Materiel (WRM)

2.4. War Reserve Materiel (WRM).
   2.4.1. WRM Transfers Between Kits.
      2.4.1.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures to transfer between WRM Special Spares
      RSPs. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101, AFI 25-101 and for IT
      specific guidance use AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
      2.4.1.2. General WRM transfer between kits. This section discusses procedures for
      preparing and processing inputs to transfer assets from one WRM detail record to
      another. Input preparation is discussed first, followed by output documents, degraded
      operations transfers, rejects, and management notices. It is important to note that
      Transfers Between Kits cannot be corrected with record reversal and correction (formerly
      RVP) and require inputs to correct any processing errors.
      2.4.1.3. The following actions will be performed:
         2.4.1.3.1. For Transfer Between Kits Inputs.
             2.4.1.3.1.1. Leave the action quantity blank when the requirements of the gaining
             detail document number are to be filled from assets recorded on WRM detail
             records specified by the input stock number, system designator, and parameters.
             The total quantity transferred will be a combination of the following.
                 2.4.1.3.1.1.1. The gaining primes.
                 2.4.1.3.1.1.2. The authorized quantity minus on-hand assets (including
                 substitutes).
                 2.4.1.3.1.1.3. The due-outs (except when due-out action flag M is used)
                 (Refer to MSK/MRSP/WRM Transfers Between Kits (1KT) in AFH 23-123,
                 Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 ).
                 2.4.1.3.1.1.4. When processing serialized reporting assets, you must process a
                 Weapons Serialized Control Input (DSR) or Serialized COMSEC Control
                 Input (XHB) prior to processing the Transfer Between Kits. Serialized
                 reporting assets cannot be transferred using the Transfer Between Kits
                 multiple option.
             2.4.1.3.1.2. If output of documents is not desired but you wish to enter specific
             quantities, enter a 6 in the input TEX code position.
             2.4.1.3.1.3. Enter Due-Out Action Flag M when due-outs are not to be considered
             in the authorized versus on-hand computations, and the program will ignore any
             due-outs. An “Excess Due-Out Details Resulted From the Use of Due-Out Flag
             M” (F202) management notice will be produced when due-outs are greater than
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   29


          on-hand quantities.
          2.4.1.3.1.4. Transfer the resulting quantity from those assets recorded on the
          detail record as specified by the first parameter of the input. When the deficiency
          is not satisfied by the detail record of the first parameter, check the detail record
          of the second parameter. Continue checking each parameter until all have been
          verified or the deficiency has been satisfied.
          2.4.1.3.1.5. When the asset position of the gaining detail record does not match
          the authorized quantity, an “On-Hand Quantity” Does Not Complement the
          Authorized Quantity: Quantity Short” (F206) management notice will be
          produced.
          2.4.1.3.1.6. When an action quantity is entered, the computer will transfer this
          quantity to and from the detail record specified by the input.
              2.4.1.3.1.6.1. Rejects occur when the gaining detail record asset position and
              the action quantity exceed the authorized quantity.
              2.4.1.3.1.6.2. Rejects occur when a selected detail record is deployed.
       2.4.1.3.2. For Transfer Between Kits Output Documents.
          2.4.1.3.2.1. The computer prepares a transfer document for each Transfer
          Between Kits transaction (Refer to MSK/MRSP/WRM Transfers Between Kits
          (1KT) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2) unless degraded operations (TEX code
          6) is used.
          2.4.1.3.2.2. When the transfer document is received, the WRM Manager
          (WRMM) will do the following.
              2.4.1.3.2.2.1. Clear the suspended creation sheet.
              2.4.1.3.2.2.2. Physically transfer the assets or coordinate with kit custodians
              for the transfer.
              2.4.1.3.2.2.3. Sign the transfer document.
              2.4.1.3.2.2.4. Distribute documents as follows.
               2.4.1.3.2.2.4.1. Copy 1 to Document Control
               2.4.1.3.2.2.4.2. Copy 2 to the losing kit or organization
               2.4.1.3.2.2.4.3. Copy 3 to the gaining kit or organization
              2.4.1.3.2.2.5. When serialized reporting assets are transferred, a Serial
              Number List (F117) management notice will be output at function 444 .
              Attach the management notice to the applicable output document and the
              property being moved.
       2.4.1.3.3. Degraded operations Transfers. When the degraded operations option
       (TEX 6) is used, the WRMM will hand-write three copies of the transfer document.
       After the transfer, the WRM monitor signs and distributes the documents IAW
       Para.2.4.1.3.2.2.4 of this section
       2.4.1.3.4. Rejects and Management Notices.
30                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            2.4.1.3.4.1. The WRMM reviews rejects for corrections and reinputs. When
            reprocessing is not necessary, the WRMM will remove and destroy the suspense
            creation sheet and take action to clear any suspended (rejected) transactions.
            2.4.1.3.4.2. The WRMM will review management notices for necessary action.
            When excess due-outs result from processing a transfer, request an inquiry of the
            gaining detail record document number. Review the due-outs of the gaining
            detail record for possible cancellation, cancellation and reestablishment under a
            losing detail record, or any additional applicable action.
  2.4.2. Maintenance of WRM Assets.
     2.4.2.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures to maintain WRM assets. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101, AFI 25-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-
     123.

            2.4.3.3.1.1. WCDO support authorizations and assets are stored on WRM-
            WCDO-SPARES (241) detail records and accounted for on the WCDO/WRM
            Munitions List (R07). Use organization/shop code 002WR and activity code W
            for detail document numbers. Account separately for rations and petroleum, oils,
            and lubricants (POLs). Follow MAJCOM provided guidance identified in WMP-
            4/WCDO cover letter.
            2.4.3.3.1.2. Geographical Location Pseudo-Base codes (GEOLOC PBC).
            WCDO PBCs are assigned by Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability
            (LOGFAC) classified system managed by ACC/A4RX. Annually a unique PBC
            is assigned for every GEOLOC with WCDO requirement. GEOLOC to PBC
            relationship can be cross-referenced in LOGFAC. PBCs when associated with an
            actual location or Base Code is classified SECRET.
                2.4.3.3.1.2.1. Load the PBC shown in the WCDO report into the WRM-
                WCDO-SPARES detail records. The PBC of the Alternate Storage Location
                (ASL) is entered in position 62-65 and the PBC of the Planner Operating Base
                (POB) is entered in positions 66-69 of the WCDO load, change, and delete.
                2.4.3.3.1.2.2. For PBCs not contained in the WCDO document, contact
                CWRMO by SIPR. CWRMO will query LOGFAC and notify base via SIPR
                of the PBC. Bases will enter the PBC in positions 62-65 and 66-69 of the
                WCDO load, change or delete.
        2.4.3.3.2. WCDO Requirements. WRM spares detail records account for two kinds
        of authorizations, as shown in the annual HQ USAF Non-Airborne RSP (NARSP)
        Authorization, Document, Volume II. The WRMM will process the applicable
        WCDO load, change, and delete (see WCDO Load, Change, And Delete (TRIC 1CK)
        in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2) to load the total WCDO authorizations.
            2.4.3.3.2.1. The authorized quantity field of each input must reflect the
            Operational Plan (OPLAN) Starter Quantity identified on the WCDO. The total
 32                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             authorization is the sum of supportables and unsupportables. Enter the
             unsupportable quantity in the appropriate field when directed by CWRMO. The
             supportable and unsupportable quantities will be maintained on the same detail.
             To request WRM ordering authority for General Support Division SMAG
             requirements, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 and AFI 25-101.
                 2.4.3.3.2.1.1. Authorizations can be loaded with or without using the
                 automatic issue program. When the automatic issue program is used the
                 processor will create a WCDO detail record and create an issue request input
                 and process the issue.
                 2.4.3.3.2.1.2. Attempting to use the automatic issue program on details with
                 unsupportability codes loaded will result in (F215) management notice.
             2.4.3.3.2.2. When notified by the AFMC SCM-R Activity SMAG manager that a
             fiscally restrained unsupportable authorization has become supportable, the
             WRMM will follow these instructions:
                 2.4.3.3.2.2.1. Part unsupportable. If only part of the assets authorized become
                 supportable, process the change input and enter the new unsupportable
                 quantity in the unsupportable quantity field. The change input to decrease the
                 unsupportable quantity cannot contain issue data. Prepare an issue request
                 according to Expendable Item Customer Issue Request (ISU) Transaction
                 Format and Documentation Requirements in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5
                 for the new supportable quantity with WRM project code DCP.
                 2.4.3.3.2.2.2. Unsupportable details becoming supportable. If the total
                 authorization becomes supportable, process a change by inputting an asterisk
                 (*) in the supportability code field and zeros in the unsupportable quantity
                 field.   Prepare an issue request according to Sec. 5B, Order and
                 Requisitioning for the new supportable quantity with WRM project code
                 DCP.
   2.4.4. WRM Special Spares Readiness Spares Packages Detail Records.
      2.4.4.1. Purpose: To explain WRM Special Spares Readiness Spares Packages (RSP)
      Detail Record procedures. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and AFI
      25-101. For IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      2.4.4.2. The following actions will be performed:
         2.4.4.2.1. For accounting for (Special Spares) Details.
             2.4.4.2.1.1. Special Spares support authorizations and assets are stored on WRM-
             SPECIAL SPARES (233) detail records with type spares code H and established,
             maintained and deleted by Special Spares load, change, delete and receipt. WRM
             special spares RSP authorizations are accounted for on the Special Spares Listing
             (R34). Use activity code U and MAJCOM Special Spares Authorization Letter or
             email to identify shop code for detail document numbers.

Section 2E—Degraded Operations
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      33


2.5. Degraded Operations.
   2.5.1. Manual Accounting during Degraded Operations.
      2.5.1.1. Purpose: Describe the manual accounting during degraded operations procedures
      process. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance
      use AFH 23-123 and the ES-S User Guide.
      2.5.1.2. These procedures apply to AFMC SCM-R Activities, LRS, satellite accounts,
      and all assigned or attached activities that maintain records on or receive support from the
      ILS-S. These procedures are to be used in the event the ILS-S (in whole or in part) is not
      available. AFMC SCM-R Activity supported bases will coordinate degraded operations
      with AFMC SCM-R Activity Control Team Chief (CTC).
      2.5.1.3. Degraded Operations. Degraded operations will meet the requirements of
      normal operations, but the extent the processes are performed and the application of
      technology used to perform them will vary depending on the situation. Scenarios that
      may drive materiel management activities into degraded operations are described in
      Supply Automated Systems Availability Scenarios AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
      Degraded operations will be tailored to each situation based on mission requirements. As
      soon as the need for degraded operations becomes apparent the LRS/Materiel
      Management Activity/AFMC SCM-R Activity will advise customers that their support
      may be limited.
         2.5.1.3.1. Transactions will be processed on a case by case basis (normally based on
         mission impact) with close coordination between the LRS/Materiel Management
         Activity, AFMC SCM-R Activity, and the sources of supply. If the situation dictates,
         some transactions may be held and processed individually after recovery is complete.
         For example, a single equipment transaction that was worked off-line during
         degraded operations might be held and processed individually. The CTC will be
         involved in decisions to withhold transactions from recovery. Degraded operations do
         not impede physical movement (transfer/deployment) of spares and equipment.
         2.5.1.3.2. Degraded operations documents are created to move the assets. Kit
         deployment/transfers are processed as part of or immediately after system recovery
         (e.g., transactions that occur at home station prior to kit deployment/ transfer are
         processed prior to application of the deployment indicator. Transactions occurring at
         the deployed site are processed after the kit deployment/transfer has processed)
         2.5.1.3.3. Computer products/listings will be used to record transactions and update
         inventory information as needed. See Base Level Data Required to Support Degraded
         Operations in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
         2.5.1.3.4. Transactions will be prepared in legacy straight-line format (flat file) and
         processed as part of the degraded operations recovery.
         2.5.1.3.5. Sequence transactions. Ensure transactions are sequenced for recovery.
         Sequencing must be precise to avoid rejects. See Degraded Operations Backlog
         Processing Sequence in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for the degraded operations
         backlog processing sequence.
34                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     2.5.1.4. Duration. If a planned outage is projected to last less than 24 hours, the Control
     Team Chief can elect not to formally activate the Control Team (CT). Hold transaction
     processing until system is available. If the outage (planned or unplanned) is projected to
     be more than 24 hours, then degraded operations will be declared and the CT will be
     activated. The CT will not be activated for normal weekends and holidays with limited
     activity.
        2.5.1.4.1. Materiel Management activities should not expect to process all
        transactions during degraded operations (even if the operation extends for an
        extraordinary length of time). The capabilities of suppliers must be considered during
        the operational assessment, i.e., if suppliers are also in a degraded mode then
        significant limitations on additional transaction processing may need to be continued.
     2.5.1.5. Functional Area Procedures. Common procedures applicable to all functional
     areas are described below.
        2.5.1.5.1. Prepare for Degraded Operations. Preparations for degraded operations
        actually begin before the ILS-Ss goes down and before degraded operations
        commence. Each functional area will ensure they are able to access the computer
        products (reports/listings/data files) and forms needed to fulfill their primary duties
        during degraded operations. Specific data needed during most degraded operations is
        addressed in Base Level Data Required to Support Degraded Operations, AFH 23-
        123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. Note: Electronic media may be used instead of physical
        forms as long as the information contained in the media meets the intent.
        2.5.1.5.2. Update Computer Products. Ensure transactions are posted to applicable
        computer products as the transaction occurs. This will ensure the viability of the
        computer product throughout the degraded operation.
        2.5.1.5.3. Enforce Controls. Special handling must be enforced during degraded
        operations. Each functional area will ensure that special handling continues to be
        applied as warranted. Check item record attributes for Controlled Item Codes,
        Serialized Report Codes, TCTO, NPPC, Suspect, Functional Check, Shelf Life, ESD,
        and Exception Codes (Issue, Shipment, and Requisition) and apply special handling
        as required. Place special emphasis on the control of pilferable, classified and
        NWRM.
        2.5.1.5.4. Recovery Files. As transactions are made, create transaction images in
        legacy straight-line (80-320 position) (flat file) format. If ILS-S is available for
        recovery processing, ensure applicable 4-position SRAN is appended to the beginning
        of each transaction image prior to batch processing. Follow example found in ES-S
        Batch Processing , AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. Limit batch transactions to 250 or
        less images.
        2.5.1.5.5. Prepare auditable documents. Prepare DD Form 1348-1A, DoD Single
        Line Item Release/Receipt Document to facilitate the movement (issues, shipments,
        transfers, and releases) of assets during degraded operations. If Asset Management
        System is available then document labels can be used for on-base movements. See
        Preparation of DD 1348-1A, (ISU/MSI/DUO/DOR/A2x/SHP/A5J Documents) in
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     35


        AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for more information on the preparation of DD Form
        1348-1A.
        2.5.1.5.6. Quality Control. Ensure transactions are correctly prepared prior to end of
        day merge or more often if required to avoid rejects during recovery processing.
        Verify data on input images match what is reflected on the reports/accountable
        documents (for example, NSN, unit of issue, quantity, document number, and system
        designator match what is reflected on computer products and/or forms such as AF
        Form 2005, Issue/Return Request or DD Form 1348-1A).
     2.5.1.6. Specific Functional Area Procedures.
        2.5.1.6.1. Customer Support Liaison.
            2.5.1.6.1.1. Call-in points will accept issue requests and perform research actions
            based on CTC guidance. Requirements accepted but not qualifying for processing
            will be held and input after recovery.
            2.5.1.6.1.2. Will load item and support records during degraded operations.
            2.5.1.6.1.3. Will support the screening of incoming receipts and returns for due-
            out release action. A list of serviceable assets maintained in the FSC will be
            consolidated with the list of serviceable assets held in Receiving so asset
            availability can be quickly determined.
            2.5.1.6.1.4. After recovery is complete, perform quality control on all auditable
            documentation for accuracy. Quality control standards and procedures outlined in
            Quick Reference Guide For DD 1348-1A Quality Control Edits, AFH 23-123,
            Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, are also applicable to degraded operations documents. Confirm
            all degraded operations documents have been process in the ILS-S.
        2.5.1.6.2. Requisitioning. During degraded operations, requisitions are processed as
        offline requisitions. Ensure all new MICAP due-outs (TEX 7) are added to the High
        Priority MICAP Boards if available (see ES-S User’s Manual). If ESS is not
        available, call in new MICAP backorders to the AFMC SCM-R MICAP Activity.
        Only when directed by the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity, forward all
        Stock replenishment Issues (transaction exception code 6) and Non MICAP
        backorders to the AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity. AFMC SCM-R Stock
        Control/MICAP Support Activity will create offline requisitions for authorized items
        using the procedures outlined in Special Requisition (SPR) Transaction, AFH 23-123,
        Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 and the requisitioning process outlined in Requisitioning , AFH 23-
        123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 used during degraded operations.
        2.5.1.6.3. Receiving. CTC will prescribe what receipts will be processed using
        degraded operations procedures. Perform normal receipt actions as outlined in AFI
        24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo. A list of all serviceable
        items held in receiving will be maintained and screened against incoming asset
        requests (issues, shipments, etc.) as requested. AFI-24-203 provides guidance on the
        receiving process used during degraded operations.
        2.5.1.6.4. Asset Management storage operations. Storage operations will conduct
        asset availability checks (to include lateral sourcing requests) as needed and notify the
 36                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


          requestor/call-in points of asset availability. Stock will be processed for issue/release
          as directed. The CTC will determine if some or all stock will be binned.
          2.5.1.6.5. Flight Service Center (FSC). The FSC will maintain control of items Due-
          in From Maintenance (DIFM). The FSC will accept and process returns as prescribed
          by the CTC. Normal in-checking and inspection functions for serviceable returns
          apply as explained in of this manual. Serviceable returns will be screened for due-
          out release action and reparable items will be evacuated as directed. DIFM Return in
          AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 provides guidance on the DIFM process used during
          degraded operations.
          2.5.1.6.6. Quality Assurance (QA). LRS QA function will monitor the entire
          degraded operations process, to include attending and observing transaction recovery.
          AFMC SCM-R Activity Control Team will manage the entire degraded operations
          process at their level. LRS Quality Assurance function will ensure an After Action
          report is created and submitted using the Sample After Action Report Template found
          in, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
          2.5.1.6.7. Inventory personnel will be available to the CT for lifting freezes that
          result from erroneous processing. This section/element will collect and process
          Special Inventory Request notices that result from Insufficient Quantity rejects.
          2.5.1.6.8. Computer Operations/Functional Systems Management.                    The
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity /AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations/Quality
          Control Activity managers will configure ILS-S to support degraded operations (to
          include Recovery). Any incoming System interface processing should be suspended
          until recovery is complete. Base level interfaces (maintenance, transportation, etc.)
          will be evaluated and disabled if needed. If IT System is available, set the recovery
          flag for Degraded Operations. Assign processing capability to users designated by
          the CTC.
          2.5.1.6.9. Other Areas Not Specifically Addressed. Specific scenarios and mission
          requirements may require the involvement of other functional areas. Other areas that
          must process materiel management transactions off-line will do so IAW the
          applicable section of this publication.

Section 2F—Readiness Spares Packages and Kits

2.6. Readiness Spares Packages and Kits.
   2.6.1. Procedures for Unsupportable Package Requirements.
      2.6.1.1. Purpose: To load, change, or delete kit and package detail records’ authorized
      quantities for RSP. Package detail records account for two kinds of authorizations,
      supported and unsupported. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for
      IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
          2.6.1.1.1. Use blank for the supportability code for fully supportable authorizations.
          2.6.1.1.2. Use F for authorizations which may not be requisitioned because of base or
          command fiscal restraints (no funds available).
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      37


     2.6.1.2. General Unsupportable Package maintenance Procedures. The following actions
     will be performed for the loading, changing, or deleting of unsupportable RSP
     requirements:
         2.6.1.2.1. Load of Total Authorization. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity RSP
         package manager must load the total package authorization. The authorized quantity
         field of each input must reflect the total authorization, which includes the sum of
         supportables and unsupportables. Then, enter the unsupportable quantity in the
         applicable field. The supportable and unsupportable quantities will be maintained on
         the same detail.
            2.6.1.2.1.1. For RSP, HPMSK, and CHPMSK input screen see Airborne Mobility
            Readiness Spares Package (AMRSP) Load, Change, Inquire, Delete and Receipt
            (1UB) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
         2.6.1.2.2. Load authorizations using automatic issue program. Processes an issue to
         establish a due-out for new supported quantities see Expendable Item Customer Issue
         Request (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements in AFH 23-123,
         Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
     2.6.1.3. Issue for Shortages. To request an issue as changes are being made to the
     supportable detail record, processes a do not requisition issue See Expendable Item
     Customer Issue Request (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements in
     AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. When the computer program processes the issue, items
     will be issued from the warehouse to balance the package detail, or a due-out for the
     quantity will be issued. If the full quantity is issued, remove the special requirements flag
     from the unsupportable due-in detail record and link the due-out and due-in together.
     2.6.1.4. Supportability Change. When notified by the AFMC SCM-R Activity SMAG
     manager that unsupportable authorization has become supportable, the WRM manager
     will follow these instructions.
         2.6.1.4.1. Part unsupportable. If only part of the assets authorized become
         supportable, process the change input and enter the new unsupportable quantity in the
         unsupportable quantity field. The change input to decrease the unsupportable quantity
         cannot contain issue data. Prepare an issue request according to Expendable Item
         Customer Issue Request (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements
         in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the new supportable quantity.
         2.6.1.4.2. Total Unsupportable. If the total authorization becomes supportable,
         process a change by inputting an asterisk (*) in the supportability code field and zeros
         in the unsupportable quantity field. Prepare an issue request according to AFH 23-
         123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the new supportable quantity.
  2.6.2. Establishing and Maintaining Detail Records for RSP.
     2.6.2.1. Purpose: To create and maintain RSP detail records. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.2.2. General procedures to load, change, and/or delete or postpone RSP detail
     records. The following procedures will be used to establish and maintain RSP detail
     records :

        2.6.2.2.1. Use MAJCOM RSP Listing. Use the listing and records received from
        Lead MAJCOM as authority to load, change, or delete RSP detail records.
        2.6.2.2.2. LRS/Materiel Management Activity conducts a joint review with
        maintenance to determine how to best segment the MAJCOM provided
        authorizations. Ensure en route support, existing taskings to multiple operating
        locations and maintenance repair facilities are taken into consideration. Configure
        non-airborne MRSP according to employment repair capabilities.
        2.6.2.2.3. Assign Shop Codes. Assign shop codes to identify a kit/package or
        kit/package increment. The first position specifies the kit number and the second the
        part or container. Conduct a joint review with maintenance to determine how to best
        segment the MAJCOM provided authorizations. Ensure en route support, existing
        taskings to multiple operating locations and maintenance repair facilities are taken
        into consideration. In all cases, airborne MRSP must be configured in a manner that
        will support the unit's mobility concept. Configure non-airborne MRSP according to
        employment repair capabilities. Bases will ensure the sum of all authorizations does
        not exceed the total MAJCOM authorized quantity. All airborne and non-airborne
        MRSP will have standard shop codes with the first and second position alpha code
        identifying the XD investment segment. Non-airborne MRSP will use a separate shop
        code for each supported end item.
        2.6.2.2.4. Process transaction to load the detail. See AMRSP Load, Change, Inquire,
        Delete and Receipt (1UB) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for all input formats that
        apply to each type of asset. When the information has been processed and verified,
        retain authorization listings or files until superseded by new authorization files.
     2.6.2.3. Postponing Repairs. When an item is issued from a deployed MRSP kit/package
     but repair of the damaged reparable item is postponed until the deployment is over,
     process the issue from MRSP detail records, using transaction exception code W.
  2.6.3. Mission Support Kits (MSK).
     2.6.3.1. Purpose: To load, change, inquire, delete, and receipt for Mission Support
     details. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance
     use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.3.2. General procedures to load, change, inquire, delete, and receipt for Mission
     Support details MSKs. Personnel in Asset Management or organizational personnel
     (when MSKs are maintained at organizational level) will perform the following
     procedures to maintain MSKs:
        2.6.3.2.1. Establishing Authorization Numbers. Each authorized item will be
        assigned an item number which will be used as the last four positions of the detail
        record document number.
        2.6.3.2.2. Processing Formats. Use format and processing procedures outlined in
        MSK Load, Change, Inquire, Delete, And Receipt (1HM) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
        1, Ch 2 to load, change, inquire, and delete a Mission Support Kit.
        2.6.3.2.3. Adding to an MSK. When adding or increasing an MSK detail record,
        compare the total combined authorized quantity of all mission support kit and supply
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       39


        point detail records to the requisition objective. A reject stating the input quantity plus
        supply point and MSK authorization quantity exceed the requisition objective (R/O)
        will be produced if the combined authorized quantity exceeds the R/O. Load or
        change the detail record accordingly. You must either increase the R/O by adding a
        special level or decrease the MSK and supply point detail record authorized quantity.
        If you do not do this when requirements computation is performed on the item, you
        will receive a management notice stating the supply point and MSK authorized
        quantity exceeds the R/O.
        2.6.3.2.4. Establishing New Codes for MDS. If an MSK supports multiple MDS,
        unique shop codes should be assigned to each MDS. This will allow classification by
        MDS on the MSK Listing.
        2.6.3.2.5. Manual Processing. When the applicable IT system is not available, follow
        degraded operations procedures found in Sec. 2E, Degraded Operations for
        transaction processing.
  2.6.4. WRM Authorizations and Reconciliations.
     2.6.4.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with steps taken before
     processing WRM authorizations, processing the WRM authorizations and performing
     WRM reconciliation. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
     specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.4.2. General procedures for steps taken before processing WRM authorizations,
     processing the WRM authorizations and performing WRM reconciliation. The following
     actions will be performed:
        2.6.4.2.1. Material Management personnel must make sure they have received the
        entire WRM authorization file.
        2.6.4.2.2. Processing the WRM authorizations
            2.6.4.2.2.1. Lead MAJCOM RSP managers will develop, create and provide the
            MAJCOM WRM Serial Number Authorization Record/WRM Authorization
            Input Record images annually to the base Asset Management Section. These
            images will be provided via email in text format. Computer operations activity
            will process the two WRM Record image files using electronic file transfer to
            appropriate IT System mainframe. Computer Operations will advise Material
            Management personnel the WRM authorization file is ready for processing.
            2.6.4.2.2.2. WRM Base Authorization Input Processor. When Computer
            Operations notifies Asset Management of the processed WRM authorization file,
            Asset Management personnel initiate the WRM Base Authorization Input
            Processor on any terminal that has demand mode capability. See MAJCOM
            WRM Serial Number Authorization Record (XTJ) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
            Ch 2 for procedures to process the WRM Base Authorization Input Processor.
        2.6.4.2.3. WRM Base Authorization Input Processor List. If the option to create
        WRM authorization input list is taken, the computer will output a WRM base
        authorization input list to help Asset Management. This list helps in loading or
        changing WRM serial number/control record(s), segments the WRM Authorization
40                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        Input Record, and assigns the shop codes and item numbers. See MAJCOM WRM
        Serial Number Authorization Record (XTJ) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for
        WRM base authorization input screen selection format. The computer outputs the
        WRM Base Authorization Input Processor list in the following sequence:
        2.6.4.2.4. Major command WRM serial number authorization input record by
        SRD/UTC.
        2.6.4.2.5. WRM authorization input record by national stock number/ SRD/UTC.
        2.6.4.2.6. Initiating WRM Base Authorization Input Processor. After completing the
        actions required on the WRM base authorization input list, initiate the WRM Base
        Authorization Input Processor process to add and/or change the applicable WRM
        details. The computer will enter the add/change images of the applicable WRM detail
        load/change in the pseudo reader to process or create a disk file for review prior to
        processing.
        2.6.4.2.7. WRM Base Authorization Input Processor Scan Option. After completing
        all adds, changes, or deletes, Asset Management should process the WRM Base
        Authorization Input Processor scan option to make sure all the WRM authorization
        input records have been processed completely. If any WRM authorization input
        records have not been completely processed, the computer will produce a WRM base
        authorization input list. Then Asset Management must complete processing for those
        WRM Authorization Input Record authorizations which appear on the WRM Base
        Authorization Input Processor list.
     2.6.4.3. WRM Reconciliation.
        2.6.4.3.1. When Asset Management personnel are satisfied that all WRM Base
        Authorization Input Processor processing has been completed correctly, they should
        schedule a WRM Reconciliation. If necessary, the WRM Base Authorization Input
        Processor can be reinitiated to make additional changes. Continue processing the RSP
        Reconciliation until no discrepancies exist.
        2.6.4.3.2. WRM Reconciliation processing procedures.           Process the WRM
        Reconciliation in the following way:
            2.6.4.3.2.1. After the WRM Base Authorization Input Processor program
            completes the WRM master authorization record file, process this file using the
            WRM Reconciliation program. Make at least two copies. If there are no variances
            or note coded items to review the WRM Reconciliation program is complete.
            2.6.4.3.2.2. Have the Materiel Management Flight Officer, LRS CC/AO, or
            ranking individual of the tenant activity responsible for the kit certify the
            reconciliation.
            2.6.4.3.2.3. Forward copy 2 to the authorizing MAJCOM and Lead MAJCOM to
            inform the major command that reconciliation is now complete. If variances or
            note coded items are in the kit, keep copy 2 to submit to the Lead MAJCOM after
            the review is complete.
  2.6.5. Status Of Resources And Training System (SORTS) Reporting Of Readiness Spares
  Packages.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    41


     2.6.5.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with SORTS Assessment
     methods, for obtaining and reporting WRM/RSP Fill Rates. Minimum Required
     Products and Skills to Support ASM Assessment Processes. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.5.2. General. These procedures reference and implement guidelines in AFI 10-201,
     Status of Resources and Training System.
     2.6.5.3. The available methods for SORTS assessments are the Weapon System
     Management Information System Sustainability Assessment Module (WSMIS SAM,
     D087C), PC-Aircraft Sustainment Model (PCASM), and Enterprise PC-ASM (EASM).
     These procedures will take you through the entire assessment and SORTS reporting
     process for RSPs.
        2.6.5.3.1. WSMIS SAM. This is an AFMC mainframe computer system that assesses
        all Air Force airborne RSPs using standard methodology. Each supply account with
        RSPs and the Forward Supply Support (FSS) System reports their asset position by
        processing the weekly MAJCOM Combat Supplies Management System (CSMS)
        Reconciliation Report R30 to Wright-Patterson AFB. The AFMC SCM-R Activity
        processes the R30 for RSPs for regionalized accounts and RSPs transferred to AFMC
        SCM-R Activity managed locations.
        2.6.5.3.2. PC-ASM. For bases with multiple weapon systems and/or MAJCOM units
        assigned under one system designator, the host LRS/CC or equivalent should be
        responsible for ensuring PC-ASM is used for SORTS reporting. Each year, upon
        completion of the base level annual RSP Reconciliation, Lead MAJCOMs will
        download Dyna-METRIC Microcomputer Analysis System (DMAS) or
        Sustainability Assessment Module (SAM) files for base use in PC-ASM via the
        SIPRNET for SORTS reporting. The using base will import the data file into PC-
        ASM for each applicable Kit Serial Number (KSN) identified in the War
        Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 3 – Combat and Support Forces. As each of the
        KSN’s are loaded into ASM, the pertinent WMP, Volume 5 – Basic Planning Factors
        and Data Scenario information are also loaded. Note: If MAJCOM directs changes to
        the RSP (i.e. adds, changes, or deletes outside of the reconciliation period), they will
        provide using bases with the updated DMAS file to import into PC-ASM. The
        reporting base will accomplish an AF Form 2011, Base Supply ADPE Work Request
        to request a single Personal Computer-Aircraft Sustainability Model Report, R-26
        from the host computer operation section to update PC-ASM with the current retail
        level WRM and POS on-hand assets for all Mission Design Series (MDS) RSPs when
        accomplishing SORTS reporting. In cases in which two or more R-26 are required,
        coordination and approval through the MAJCOM is required. It is critical that both
        the PC-ASM RSP files and the R-26 are set up on OPLAN-tasked and DOC-response
        –time sequence. The MAJCOM will include the sequence numbers on the annual
        MRSP load letter. SORTS reporting will be accomplished on the 1st of each month or
        next duty day should it fall on a weekend or holiday and problem parts must be
        aggressively worked at that time. Results/Problem parts are included in the SORTS
        report to include detailed status of the parts and the impact on maintenance.
42                                                            AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        2.6.5.3.3. EASM. The AFMC SCM-R Activity is responsible for the development of
        EASM assessments for RSP SORTS reporting. Each year, upon completion of the
        MAJCOM RSP review process and subsequent posting of current Dyna-METRIC
        Microcomputer Analysis System (DMAS) files into WMIS-SAM, the AFMC SCM-R
        Activity will extract and load the applicable RSP data for each ASM assessed Kit
        Serial Number (KSN) identified in the WMP, Volume 3. As each of these KSN’s are
        loaded into ASM, the pertinent WMP, Volume 5 scenario information are loaded. On
        the 1st of each month or next duty day should it fall on a weekend or holiday, the
        AFMC SCM-R Activity will provide a consolidated R-26 to update ASM with the
        current retail level WRM and POS on-hand assets for each Mission Design Series
        (MDS) assessed within ASM. Problem parts will be identified as the result of the
        assessments, and passed to the applicable weapon system spares management team
        for analysis and action.
     2.6.5.4. For fill rates see AFI 10-201.
  2.6.6. Performing and Interpreting PC-ASM Assessments.
     2.6.6.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with performing initial PC-
     ASM assessment. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
     specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.6.2. General procedures to perform initial PC-ASM assessment.              The following
     actions will be performed.
     2.6.6.3. Setting Assessment Parameters. Use the default settings that appear on the PC-
     ASM assessment drop-down menu: i.e., Stock Type = On-Hand Stock, Component Data
     Type = WSMIS data, RRR LRU Repair Start = 3 (if assessing an IRSP, set this to 1),
     Problem LRU Count = 20, Problem SRU Count = 10, Model Output = OFF, and Small
     PAA Unit = OFF.
     2.6.6.4. For most units the reported assessment from PC-ASM is the “availability %
     (Method Z)”, which cross references to AFI 10-201, applicable rules (9-24) from table
     4.9, and is cross referenced to the applicable S-rating. For strategic airlift only, the sortie
     generation capability (method “Y”) is used and is accomplished only via WSMIS/SAM
     as a “fleet” rating. Strategic (C-5/C-17) bases are not required to perform PC-ASM
     assessments. This fleet assessment rating is computed via WSMIS/SAM, and the results
     can be obtained directly from WSMIS/SAM via SIPRNET. Even if your availability
     percentage equates to an S-1 level, problem parts are generated if your aircraft
     availability percentage falls below the Air Force minimum Direct Support Objectives
     (DSOs) of 93% for Strategic Airlift; 83 percent for Tactical Airlift, Tankers, Strategic
     Operations, and Bombers; and 63 percent for Fighters (default minimum). Refer to AFI
     10-201 for DSO information convert PC-ASM results to the SORTS percentages and S-
     Levels.
     2.6.6.5. Once the PC-ASM assessment is completed, produce the Problem Parts List. To
     do so, click on “Print Summary & Problem Parts” to identify any problem parts as a
     result of the PC-ASM assessment.
     2.6.6.6. If your MRSP(s) assessed to S-1 and has not generated any problem parts you
     are finished with PC-ASM and ready to fill out your SORTS worksheet. If an assessment
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    43


     is less than S-1 and/or problem parts are identified contact AFMC SCM-R Activity for
     further research and assistance.
  2.6.7. Performing and Interpreting EASM Assessments.
     2.6.7.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with the AFMC SCM-R
     Activity performing initial EASM assessments. For policy specific requirements review
     AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.7.2. General procedures followed by the AFMC SCM-R Activity to perform initial
     EASM assessments.
        2.6.7.2.1. Load current FY D087C WSMIS/SAM. DMAS files into ASM.
        2.6.7.2.2. On a SIPR system, add MDS applicable War Mobilization Plan Volume 5
        (WMP-5) scenario data for SORTS assessments (hours/sortie, sortie rate, and max
        sortie, decel rates if applicable).
        2.6.7.2.3. Load R-26 on-hand spares data into ASM.
        2.6.7.2.4. Within EASM, there are two methods in which the R-26 assets may be
        allocated to the Fleet RSPs: Fleet Proportional and Fleet Priority schemes. Fleet
        Proportional allocation spreads POS and spares evenly based on the authorizations
        with the goal of bringing all KSNs to the same equivalent performance level and
        generally achieve a higher fleet overall assessment. Fleet Priority allocation fills top
        priority RSPs optimally until availability target or item authorization is reached. This
        method provides a flexible option for assessing different scenarios. i.e. filling an RSP
        tasked for deployment. The AFMC SCM-R Activity will utilize the Fleet
        Proportional allocation scheme for monthly RSP assessments. The Fleet Priority
        allocation scheme will be utilized to initially robust RSPs identified in WMP Volume
        4, Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) Operational Plan (OPLAN) and Contingency
        Plan (CONPLAN) with Type Phase Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) scenarios.
        2.6.7.2.5. Assess RSP. EASM will perform modeling assessment and provide results
        on the Fleet Assessment Output tab. RSP kits are listed in priority sequence with
        Fleet Size, ENMCS data, Availability flown percentage. The fleet size is equal to the
        Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA) of the MDS weapon system supported by the
        RSP kit. The availability flown percentage is the percentage of the PAA supported
        that are expected to be FMC (fully mission capable) at the completion of the
        assessment scenario.
        2.6.7.2.6. After processing each unit and MDS fleet assessment, the AFMC SCM-R
        Activity will update the monthly RSP assessment data located on the SIPR EASM
        CoP.
     2.6.7.3. The AFMC SCM-R Activity shall provide EASM outputs to the LRS CC or
     equivalent to be utilized at their discretion. These EASM output files provide units with
     the A/A and the ENMCS reporting categories for determining the health of the MRSP(s).
     The first category is the aircraft availability (A/A). This is the primary measured
     category for determining your S-Level for SORTS reporting. (Refer to AFI 10-201 for
     Direct Support Objective (DSO) information to convert EASM results to SORTS
     percentages and S-Levels) Even if your sortie percentage equates to an S-1 level,
44                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     problem parts are generated if a single stock number exceeds the ENMCS threshold,
     which is the inverse of the Direct Support Object for the RSP’s Primary Aircraft
     Authorization.
     2.6.7.4. Problem parts identified by AFMC SCM-R Activity EASM monthly assessment
     processing are annotated on the applicable Fleet RSP assessment data located on the
     SIPR EASM CoP. In addition, the AFMC SCM-R Activity will provide identified
     problem part data to the AFMC SCM-R Activity for weapon system team review/action.
     2.6.7.5. If your MRSP(s) assessed to S-1 and has not generated any problem parts you
     are finished and ready to fill out your SORTS worksheet. If an assessment is less than S-
     1 and/or problem parts are identified contact AFMC SCM-R Activity for further research
     and assistance. EASM provides the capability to enhance the asset position and thus
     obtain assessments that are more robust by including all locally available assets and
     enterprise wide assets if applicable.
     2.6.7.6. As Requested Assessments. The AFMC SCM-R Activity will process out-of-
     cycle assessments upon request. Situations that may require an out-of-cycle assessment
     are contingency deployment computations, destruction and reconstitution assessments of
     spares due to natural disaster, fire, war, etc. ASM assessment requests shall be submitted
     to the AFMC SCM-R Activity Logistics Operation Cell (LOC). Figure 2.1 provides the
     minimum information required for a contingency deployment computation. Figure 2.2
     provides the minimum information required for RSP destruction and reconstitution
     assessment.

  2.6.8. Working Assessment Shortfalls.
     2.6.8.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with Working Assessment
     Shortfalls. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.8.2. General procedures to perform to work assessment shortfalls. Host and tenant
     units must work together to prevent “double counting” assets, correct ILS-S Audit Report
     mismatches, and research problem parts. The following steps will be performed.
     2.6.8.3. Ensure DIFM assets are properly coded and can be repaired on base. If not they
     need to be returned to the depot and requisitioned.
     2.6.8.4. Initiate Supply/Command assistance actions to AFMC SCM-R Activity on
     potential single failure component parts. (This is not necessary if your weapon system
     and depot use EXPRESS).
     2.6.8.5. Coordinate with Maintenance to determine the impact each problem part will
     have on the wartime mission and to identify any additional assets that may be available
     for use, e.g., Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM) assets,
     cannibalized assets from Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI), Attrition Reserve (AR)
     aircraft, and Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) coded aircraft.
         2.6.8.5.1. These problem parts are identified by NSN in the ESSA1 Remarks Label
         along with authorized quantity, RSP balance, other serviceable base assets, a
         description of the problem, anticipated maintenance man-hours to perform
         cannibalizations, and actions taken to resolve the problem.
         2.6.8.5.2. Verify SPRAM assets are in serviceable condition and assets would be
         available within DOC response time. The time must include removal, inspection,
         packing, palletizing, and marshaling. Consider only assets which maintenance can
         reasonably cannibalize in the pre-deployment phase within DOC response times from
         BAI, AR, and PDM coded aircraft. Ensure BAI/AR aircraft are available for
         cannibalization and not being used to backfill a grounded war-tasked aircraft. Aircraft
         in PDM status located off base will not be considered for cannibalization plans.
         2.6.8.5.3. After applying these additional wing assets to the appropriate RSPs in PC-
         ASM, rerun the PC-ASM assessment. Cannibalized or other base assets that are
         available can only be applied against RSP shortfalls once, not applied against each
         squadron independently. Remember, to reload the wartime flying scenario before you
         run the enhanced PC-ASM assessment (refer to the security portion of the classified
         flying scenario message).
         2.6.8.5.4. This second enhanced PC-ASM assessment will normally increase both
         sorties generated and aircraft availability. Use AFI 10-201, to convert the PC-ASM
         results to the SORTS percentage and S-Level.
  2.6.9. Post-SORTS Assessment Actions.
     2.6.9.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with post SORTS
     assessment follow-up actions. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and
     for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   47


     2.6.9.2. General procedures for Post SORTS pro-active actions. The following actions
     will be performed by AFMC SCM-R Activity:
        2.6.9.2.1. Units with PC-ASM capability will continually review the status of
        problem parts and pacing items, and coordinate with stock control to generate follow-
        ups/supply assistance requests when the LRS CC/AO has authorized this action.
        2.6.9.2.2. Compare EXPRESS Tables and D035C with applicable IT system records.
            2.6.9.2.2.1. LRS/Materiel Management Activities should compare the D035C
            reported asset position and the EXPRESS tables on the PC-ASM generated
            problem parts to ensure accurate D028/RAMPS reporting.
            2.6.9.2.2.2. In D035C, verify the reported demand level, WRM level, serviceable
            Peacetime Operating Stock (POS) balance, WRM balance, Due In/On-Hand
            DIFM, and in-transit serviceable levels are correct when compared to your
            applicable IT system records.
            2.6.9.2.2.3. EXPRESS tables should be reviewed to ensure the depot has these
            parts with the proper SORTS values, and scheduled for repair and/or distribution.
            2.6.9.2.2.4. The applicable IT system must initiate any corrective actions, not the
            Item Manager. A return maybe required to correct a DIFM problem, or releveling
            may be needed to correct a D028 problem with a WRM or POS level, etc.
  2.6.10. Home Station Consumable Readiness Spares Package (CRSP) Processing.
     2.6.10.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with home station CRSP
     processing. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.10.2. General procedures to perform loading and requisitioning of home station
     CRSP packages. The following steps will be performed:
     2.6.10.3. Loading CRSPs. When a CRSP package is not required for an imminent
     deployment or contingency, the withdrawal flag on each RSP detail will be set to "Y"
     thereby allowing unrestricted issues and lateral support shipments from CRSPs. The
     automatic withdrawal flag will be set to "N" when a deployment or contingency is
     imminent to restrict withdrawals. See MRSP/IRSP Serial Number And Control Record
     Change in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for additional information about loading RSP
     withdrawal flags. If the CRSP is segmented into multiple packages, the combined Total
     Wartime Requirement (TWR) for all RSP details for each stock number will not exceed
     the MAJCOM-computed TWR for the stock number for that SRAN.
        2.6.10.3.1. Implementing CRSP via RSP Details. Para 2.6.1 of this chapter provides
        the procedures for establishing RSP details. The MAJCOM can specify the use of
        either the MRSP or IRSP.
     2.6.10.4. Requisitioning CRSP Assets. Use standard RSP fill procedures to requisition
     CRSP requirements. The quantity requisitioned and maintained as a CRSP package at the
     home station is the RSP TWR quantity. the Contingency Flag Review process will
     initiate requisition modifier transactions as appropriate to ensure the pertinent base
     requisition quantities up to the TWR are assigned CRSP project codes and priorities. The
48                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     Contingency Flag Review is the process used to modify the JCS project flags and
     JCS/Intra-Air Force project codes on replenishment requisition transactions.
  2.6.11. Storage and Maintenance.
     2.6.11.1. Procedures for Storage and Maintenance all RSP
        2.6.11.1.1. Purpose: Provide guidance on storing and maintaining RSPs. For policy
        specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-
        123.
        2.6.11.1.2. General procedures and requirements for storage and maintenance of all
        RSP General procedures and requirements for storage and maintenance of all RSP.
        Refer to Para’s 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 of this manual.
  2.6.12. Independent/Dependent Concept.
     2.6.12.1. Purpose: Provide guidance on combining dependent MRSP and independent
     MRSP to enable single SORTS reporting. For policy specific requirements review AFI
     23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.12.2. Regardless of how the authorized MRSP is warehoused or packaged for
     deployment, it will be reported as a single MRSP of the Primary Mission Aircraft
     Inventory (PMAI). The dependent MRSP will be combined with the independent MRSP
     and will be SORTS reported as a single MRSP of the combined PMAI.
     2.6.12.3. General procedures for combining dependent MRSP and independent MRSP.
     The following procedures will be used to establish the “working package” and
     computation adjustments for SORTS reporting of the combined PMAI.
     2.6.12.4. When units operate under the independent/dependent concept, a "working
     package" of the combined PMAI must be built. This package will not be listed in the
     RSP Authorization Document, and will always have an authorization factor of zero,
     because no such unit actually exists. The working package and dependent MRSP will be
     built after all file maintenance has been done on the independent package.
     2.6.12.5. Create the working package by copying the independent package to a serial
     number containing the combined PMAI of the independent and the dependent packages,
     and an "N" in the thirteenth position of the PSN. In this new "N" package, change the
     flying hours and Direct Support Objectives (DSO) to reflect the combined PMAI. Create
     the dependent MRSP by copying the independent MRSP to a serial number containing
     the dependent PMAI and an “N” in the thirteenth position, then, if necessary, adjusting
     the flying hours and the DSOs.
     2.6.12.6. The independent/dependent operational concept requires adjustments after the
     computation. The independent, dependent, and working packages are computed
     separately. Quantities in the dependent package are then adjusted follows:
        2.6.12.6.1. The System Program Manager (SPM) must send the independent and
        working kits to be computed along with all the rest of the kits.
        2.6.12.6.2. The SPM must create a post-computation database on the REALM PC
        server and use the “TID” dependent kit calculation tool. After entering the three kit
        serial numbers and executing the computation, the dependent kit will be populated.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 49


        For computing items the dependent kit quantity is determined mechanically by
        subtracting the independent kit quantity from the working kit quantity. For non-
        computing items the dependent kit receives the same NOP quantity as the
        independent kit.
  2.6.13. Communications Security (COMSEC) MRSP.
     2.6.13.1. Purpose: To identify additional requirements to manage COMSEC items on
     MRSP. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance
     use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.13.2. General requirements to manage COMSEC MRSP details.            The following
     additional requirements will be followed for COMSEC MRSP assets:
     2.6.13.3. See Complete Inventory Count Procedures in Ch 5 for COMSEC MRSP
     inventory procedures.
     2.6.13.4. Aircraft Parts Store for the host Computer Support Base (CSB) serves as the
     point of contact for the COMSEC MRSP custodian and helps establish and maintain the
     MRSP.
     2.6.13.5. If a COMSEC MRSP is transferred, the MAJCOM authorizing the MRSP will
     identify the computer support base SRAN and COMSEC station number where the
     MRSP will be transferred.
  2.6.14. Out-of-Cycle Change Requests.
     2.6.14.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with submitting an Out-Of
     –Cycle Change Request. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
     specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.14.2. Out-of-cycle change requests are submitted on the AF Form 1032, WRM
     Spares List, or equivalent for recoverables and for consumables. Due to the workload
     involved, and the impact on package requirements, out of cycle changes should be kept to
     a minimum.
     2.6.14.3. Coordination among the offices concerned is essential. If an out-of-cycle
     change request is required, the initiator, the authorizing and Lead MAJCOM, and the
     SPM RSP Manager must be kept informed and given enough time to take appropriate
     action. Each office having action on an out-of-cycle change request must promptly
     acknowledge receipt of messages (to include e-mail), or AF Form 1032.
     2.6.14.4. Changes to economic order quantity (EOQ) items in contingency readiness
     spares package (CRSP) are approved by the authorizing MAJCOM. The Lead MAJCOM
     will provide the changes to the SPM RSP Manager in the D040 system format. If ten or
     fewer stock numbers are involved, a message or e-mail may be submitted.
     2.6.14.5. Changes to investment items in an RSP are approved by the SPM RSP
     manager, in close coordination with the applicable IMS/Equipment Specialist and Lead
     MAJCOM. Requests for changes will be made in AF Form 1032 format (or equivalent).
     Mandatory entries are the note code, stock number, quantity, work unit code, division
     code, the package or end item serial number, and the justification for the proposed
     change. Once the change is approved, All of the following actions are required otherwise
50                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     the RSP authorizations and the data files supporting readiness assessments will be
     inconsistent:
        2.6.14.5.1. The SPM RSP manager must make the change (as an adjustment) in
        Reliability Execution Availability Logistics Module.
        2.6.14.5.2. The Lead MAJCOM RSP Manager must notify the impacted base(s) of
        the change.
        2.6.14.5.3. The Lead MAJCOM RSP Manager must request, from HQ AFMC, new
        ASM files be extracted to support availability assessments.
  2.6.15. Base Level Review of Readiness Spares Package.
     2.6.15.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures and tasks associated with the annual
     base level RSP review process. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and
     for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     2.6.15.2. The review is to update the range of items in RSPs and verify the complete set
     of data used to compute quantities for those items. The review will include all
     recoverable items. Stock class 1377 cartridge actuated devices and propellant actuated
     devices are exempt from annual review. Selected EOQ items, to include the following
     categories, must also be reviewed: aircraft guns, gun components, aircraft wheels, aircraft
     tires, aircraft brakes and brake components, and others, as agreed between the SPM RSP
     Manager and Lead MAJCOMs. The review process provides a forum to forecast any
     RSP add/change/ deletes and the anticipated cost to buy them. The following actions will
     be performed:
        2.6.15.2.1. Annually, the RSP packages are reviewed. Authorizations are computed
        from historical demand data and programmed scenarios. However, inputs from the
        ALC, MAJCOM, Base RSP managers, and maintenance experts provide information
        necessary for determining valid authorizations. . These tasks are part of the annual
        RSP review process.
        2.6.15.2.2. Conduct a joint review with maintenance to determine how to best to
        segment the MAJCOM provided RSP Authorization document. Ensure existing
        taskings to multiple operating locations and maintenance repair facilities are taken
        into consideration. In all cases, airborne MRSPs must be configured in a manner that
        will support the unit’s mobility concept.
        2.6.15.2.3. The Base RSP manager will schedule a face-to-face base level review
        session with maintenance and distribute worksheets to lead technicians. The Base
        RSP Manager will serve as chair and record minutes, forward minutes and results to
        Lead MAJCOM.
        2.6.15.2.4. MAJCOM RSP/SPM Manager must be informed to review Authorization
        document for accuracy of the following data: Look for indentured data to the Next
        Higher Assembly, Item Type (LRU/SRU), Quantity per Aircraft (QPA) Maintenance
        Concept, Cannibalization indicator and TO Fig/Index
  2.6.16. Asset Deployment and Transfer.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      51


   2.6.16.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with deploying and
   transferring RSPs. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
   guidance use AFH 23-123.
          2.6.16.1.1. General procedures to deploy and transfer a RSP package or package
          segment from home station to a forward location or base. The following actions will
          be performed.
       2.6.16.2. Deployment. The movement of a RSP from home station to a forward location
       or base, usually for less than 30 days are accomplished by processing WRM Detail
       Record Deployment and Return Processor.
2.6.16.2.1. Not Used.
2.6.16.2.2. Not Used.
          2.6.16.2.3. Losing Base RSP monitor will accomplish the following.
              2.6.16.2.3.1. RSP personnel will process WRM Detail Record Deployment inputs
              to update the asset status flag on each unit's deployed package detail record.
              2.6.16.2.3.2. Produce the applicable package list for the RSP segment deployed
              and retain a copy at the home base.
              2.6.16.2.3.3. Delete the asset status flag immediately upon return after post-
              deployment inventory. After deployment, when the package has returned to the
              home base, process a WRM Detail Record Return to delete the asset status flag.
              2.6.16.2.3.4. Update applicable IT system database records by processing
              degraded operations recovery files within the IT system immediately after return.
          2.6.16.2.4. Losing Base Replenishment. Replenish the deployed package if required,
          from the unit's home base if airlift is available. Submit to MICAP the requirements
          from the host Base Supply for items not available in the package. Once a MICAP is
          verified, the host Base Supply will take necessary action to obtain the item using
          normal MICAP procedures.
       2.6.16.3. Transfer. Deploying units for over 30 days will transfer supply accounts to the
       AFMC SCM-R Activity servicing the deployment theater. Transfers are accomplished
       by processing WRM Detail Record Transfer. See WRM Detail Record Transfer
       (NGV471) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for select and parameter images.
          2.6.16.3.1. The gaining AFMC SCM-R Activity will provide detailed kit transfer
          instructions, to include a request for the latest results of the PC-Aircraft Sustainment
          Model (PCASM) assessment. The deploying unit will use the PC-ASM assessment to
          identify critical problem items and evaluate the overall spares posture of the gained
          unit. Kit transfer procedures will include specific redeployment instructions.
          2.6.16.3.2. Deploying Unit Responsibilities. Use degraded operations procedures for
          transaction processing during package or segment package transfers. Use the package
          listing and a log book or local computer products to record all transactions to or from
          the transferred package. Continue until all information is uploaded on the gaining
          CSB computer or reloaded at the unit's home station after redeployment. Document

                                SOURCING OF MATERIEL

Section 3A—Overview

3.1. Overview. This chapter outlines AF guidance for completing supply chain materiel
management processes associated with the sourcing of materiel activities. These activities
include Local Purchase and Retail Sales; Receipt Processing, Item Management; and
Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Materiel Shortages. For this chapter, DoD 4140.1-R
and DoD 4140.26-M serve as primary DoD sources and various AF publications also serve as
references.

Section 3B—Local Purchase and Retail Sales

3.2. Local Purchase and Retail Sales. This section explains ILS-S processing of local
purchase requisitioning. Processes are explained concerning submission, status, follow-up, and
reconciliation of local purchase requisitions.
   3.2.1. Local Purchase Submission Procedures. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity
   is responsible for local purchase requisitions. DoD and AF policy allows for the local
   purchase of items as another avenue to fulfill base requirements. Local purchase provides
   another method to obtain low cost items locally, quickly, and efficiently. In the ILS-S, local
   purchase requisitions are normally assigned routing identifier code (RIC) JBB.
       3.2.1.1. Purpose: To provide local purchase submission procedures. For policy specific
       requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
       3.2.1.2. General Submission Procedures. Use the following steps for all local purchase
       requisitions.
       3.2.1.3. Ensure four copies of DD Form 1348-6, Single Line Item Requisition System
       Document, DoD(Manual-Long Form) are completed IAW Requirements for completing
       DD 1348-6, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3. At a minimum ensure the following blocks
       are filled in:

            3.2.1.3.1. Distribute DD Form 1348-6 as follows:
                3.2.1.3.1.1. Copy 1: Customer Support.
                3.2.1.3.1.2. Copy 2: Customer.
                3.2.1.3.1.3. Copy 3 & 4: As locally determined when supported by Standard
                Procurement System (SPS).
         3.2.1.4. LRS/Materiel Management Activity loads the descriptions for local purchase
         items into the SPS when a new item is loaded into the ILS-S and sends a local purchase
         requisition to the SPS.
         3.2.1.5. Follow general requisition steps for customers’ orders IAW Sec. 5B, Order and
         Requisitioning of this manual.
      3.2.2. Special Submission Procedures.
         3.2.2.1. Purpose: To provide local purchase procedures needed for special requirements.
         For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
         AFH 23-123. Note: For all submissions, follow all steps in Para. 3.2.1 and the
         following:
         3.2.2.2. Project Buy U.S. (BUSH) for Overseas Bases. If the base is located overseas
         (OCONUS), the RIC equals JBH (Federal Supply Schedule), and the REX code is not 2,
         Base Contracting must accept and process the local purchase requisition to determine if
         Project BUSH applies. If applicable, Base Contracting will notify Supply to change the
         RIC to JBG (Project BUSH). If not applicable, LRS/Materiel Management Activity will
         assign REX code 2 to the local purchase item record and process a request cancellation
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    55


     for the requisition. The ILS-S will produce a new requisition with the routing identifier
     code of GSA, DLA, or AFMC.
     3.2.2.3. Mandatory Requirements for Local Purchase of AF-Managed Investment Items.
     All local purchase requests for AF-managed investment items must be channeled through
     the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will
     record the appropriate demand and consumption data for demand-based stock leveling
     purposes. Note: Although LRS/Materiel Management Activity may suggest a local
     contractor parts store as a supply source for AF-managed investment items, the Base
     Contracting Office (BCO) makes the final decision on vendor selection. Use the
     following instructions to process the local purchase of AF-managed investment items:
        3.2.2.3.1. Establish Retail Supply System Due-In Detail. Process a special
        requisition (SPR) with RIC JBB, signal code A, and fund code 64 to establish the
        due-in detail for AF-managed items (budget code 8, A-H, J-X, or Blank) in the ILS-S.
        3.2.2.3.2. Provide AF Funding Citation. Acquire a funds citation from the source of
        supply and manually prepare a DD Form 1348-1A requisition (A0*) transaction. The
        DD Form 1348-1A will contain the obligation authority and funds citation (received
        from the source of supply) in Block 3 (Ship To). Note: Do not use local funds to
        locally purchase AF-managed items. The depot source of supply should provide a
        funds citation for the assets.
        3.2.2.3.3. Local Purchase of AF-Managed Recoverable Items. Local purchase of
        AF-managed recoverable items is also authorized following the procedures described
        above for AF-managed investment items. AF-managed recoverable items contain
        ERRCD XD*/XF*, budget code 8, and are purchased from base CSAG stock fund
        monies. To establish the due-in detail and create a local purchase requisition (A0*)
        for AF-managed recoverable items in the ILS-S, process a manual SPR transaction
        with RIC JBB. Note: The BCO will cite CSAG stock fund monies to purchase the
        requisitioned items.
     3.2.2.4. Processing Emergency Local Purchase Requisitions. GSA items (budget code 9)
     with a DLA RIC of S** that have been locally purchased for emergency situations will
     be processed according to the following instructions.
        3.2.2.4.1. Special Requisition Transaction Input. SCM-R Activities/ LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity personnel will process a SPR transaction to establish the due-
        in detail and create an output requisition (A0*) transaction. Use RIC JBB in positions
        4-6 and S** RIC in positions 57-59 (project code). If the ILS-S will assign the
        requisition number, leave positions 30-43 blank. If the requisition is prepared offline,
        enter the offline requisition number in positions 30-43.
        3.2.2.4.2. Special Instructions for Base Contracting. Base Contracting will use the
        special instructions contained in AF 64 series directives to locally purchase items for
        DLA (S**) RICs.
     3.2.2.5. Local Purchase Adjustment Transactions. The LRS/Materiel Management
     Receiving function will coordinate with Customer Support Liaison for bulk deliveries to
     BCE. Customer Support Liaison will process local purchase adjustment transactions in
     the material management IT system to adjust the requisition quantity and/or dollar value
56                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     of the requirement when they are different from the original requisition quantity and/or
     dollar value. See Local Purchase Status Adjustment (LPA) Transaction in AFH 23-123,
     Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for more information concerning local purchase adjustment
     transactions.
     3.2.2.6. Local Purchase of Compressed Gases. To reduce costs for cylinder handling and
     transportation, purchase industrial grade compressed gases locally whenever possible.
     The GSA federal supply schedule contains a list of vendors approved for local purchase
     of compressed gases. If there are not enough cylinders available, submit initial or
     increased requirements for compressed gases to the DLA Aviation in the following
     manner:
        3.2.2.6.1. Overseas Activities. OCONUS retail Materiel Management Activities
        submit a requisition for the NSN assigned to the filled cylinder if the acquisition
        advice code (AAC) is K and the Federal Stock Class (FSC) is 6830.
        3.2.2.6.2. CONUS Activities. CONUS activities submit a requisition for the NSN
        assigned to the empty cylinder if the AAC equals D and the FSC equals 8120.
        Normally DLA Aviation will supply the empty cylinder. Empty cylinders are filled
        with gas through local purchase requisitioning procedures. However, to satisfy a
        CONUS gas cylinder requisition, the IM may work with the customer to substitute
        full cylinders for empty ones. DLA Aviation can take this action only if stock levels
        permit, and there are unusual circumstances to justify the substitution, or the customer
        urgently needs the full cylinder.
        3.2.2.6.3. Requisitioning Gases. CONUS or OCONUS activities will not use DLA
        Aviation to requisition any stock number assigned to gases only (FSC 6830). These
        stock numbers are for local purchase only. If local purchase sources are disrupted or
        unavailable, or if local purchase cannot meet the customer need, DLA Aviation will
        assist the customer to acquire gas as necessary. In any circumstance, requisitions to
        DLA Aviation must include either the NSN assigned to the empty cylinder (AAC D),
        or the filled cylinder (AAC K), not the gas itself (AAC L).
  3.2.3. Local Purchase Requisition Status.
     3.2.3.1. Purpose: This section explains how LRS/Materiel Management Activities
     manages status for local purchase requisitions. This section explains the submission and
     receipt of local purchase status from the Base Contracting Office (BCO). For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     3.2.3.2. The LRS manages local purchase requisition procedures for SPS. BCO will
     assign status to local purchase requisitions for input to the ILS-S during daily (inline)
     processing. BCO produces a variety of local purchase status transactions (with local
     purchase coding) to the ILS-S to update internal records.
     3.2.3.3. LPS transaction. DoD and AF local purchase status is provided to update status
     concerning a purchase order or contract. BCO assigns the purchase order number and
     provides a local purchase status (LPS) transaction to update the purchase order number,
     date, and all associated coding on ILS-S local purchase status details. See AFH 23-123,
     Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for local purchase status (LPS) transaction format and processing
     instructions.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   57


     3.2.3.4. Local purchase status change transaction. BCO provides local purchase status
     change transactions to the ILS-S to update local purchase requisition status, Estimated
     Delivery Date (EDD), contract number, purchase order number, and the BPA call number
     in the ILS-S. See Local Purchase Status Change (EDD) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol
     2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for Local Purchase Status Change transaction format and processing
     instructions.
     3.2.3.5. Local purchase cancellation (LCC) transaction. DoD and AF local purchase
     cancellation status is provided to cancel local purchase requisitions or decrease local
     purchase requisition quantities. Base Contracting will provide the LCC transaction to the
     ILS-S for processing. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for LCC transaction format and
     processing instructions.
     3.2.3.6. Local purchase status adjustment (LPA) transaction. LPA transactions are
     produced by BCO and forwarded to the ILS-S. The LPA transaction primarily notifies
     the ILS-S of adjustments to either the local purchase price or quantity. See AFH 23-123,
     Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for LPA transaction format and processing instructions.
     3.2.3.7. Local purchase extra (LPX) transaction. The LPX transaction is a CEMAS
     unique transaction that provides the ILS-S complete Procurement Instrument
     Identification Number (PIIN) and contract year, from the Award Purchase Request
     (AWDPR) file. The LPX transaction may also be used by the LRS/Materiel Management
     Activity to manually process local purchase detail updates. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
     Ch 3 for LPX transaction format and processing instructions.
     3.2.3.8. Local purchase receipt acknowledgement (1RA) transaction. The 1RA
     transaction is used to update SPS purchase order records. When the LRS/Materiel
     Management Activity or equivalent Receiving function processes a local purchase
     receipt, the ILS-S produces a 1RA transaction and sends it to the SPS. See Standard
     Procurement System (SPS) Local Purchase Receipt Acknowledgment (1RA) Transaction
     in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for 1RA transaction format and processing instructions.
     3.2.3.9. Local Purchase Requisition Cancellation Request (AC1) Transaction. Requests
     to cancel local purchase requisitions are created in the ILS-S through file status or the
     manual processing of a local purchase requisition cancellation request transaction. The
     ILS-S computes and requests cancellation for due-in excess each time requirements
     computation is performed. When the ILS-S computes due-in excess, it automatically
     formats an AC1 transaction, assigns status code ZD to the local purchase status detail,
     and forwards to the SPS. If a manual requisition cancellation request is made, the ILS-S
     formats an AC1 transaction with status code ZC. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for
     the format and processing instructions for the local purchase AC1 output transaction.
     3.2.3.10. Local purchase requisition cancellation request follow-up (AK1) transaction.
     An AK1 transaction is created in the ILS-S if Base Contracting does not reply to the first
     AC1 transaction within 10 calendar days. Base Contracting will process both
     cancellation request and cancellation request follow-up transactions and automatically
     reply with Local Purchase Cancellation , Local Purchase Status or Supply Status
     transactions to acknowledge, change, update, or cancel the local purchase requisition.
  3.2.4. Local Purchase Requisition Follow-up.
58                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     3.2.4.1. Purpose: This section explains how requisition follow-up actions are performed
     for local purchase requisitions. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity is responsible
     for local purchase follow-up. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and
     for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     3.2.4.2. Local purchase requisition follow-up. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity
     performs follow-up for local purchase requisitions. Requisition follow-up (AF*) and
     reinstatement (AT*) transactions are also produced by the ILS-S for local purchase
     requisitions. The type of follow-up transaction produced depends upon whether the
     status detail contains status or not. Local purchase follow-up transactions are produced
     as follows:
        3.2.4.2.1. Local purchase requisition with status. The ILS-S produces automated
        follow-up (AF*) transactions when updated procurement status has not been provided
        within established timeframes. The type of requisition AF* transaction produced
        depends on the base location, priority, estimated delivery date, and the date of last
        transaction (DOLT).
        3.2.4.2.2. Local purchase requisition without status. The ILS-S produces automated
        requisition reinstatement (AT*) follow-up transactions when initial procurement
        status has not been provided within established timeframes. The type of requisition
        follow-up (AT*) transaction produced depends upon base location, priority,
        requisition date, and DOLT.
     3.2.4.3. Action Required (ARC) Report Transaction for Local Purchase Requisitions.
     The LRS/Materiel Management Activity is responsible for ARC transactions for local
     purchase requisitions.
        3.2.4.3.1. ARC transactions are created on the third and subsequent follow-ups for
        local purchase requisitions. Position 71 of the ARC transaction will be blank and
        positions 72-76 will contain the purchase order number. If BCO has not replied to
        follow-up transactions within established schedules, an ARC transaction will be
        created by the ILS-S and forwarded to Customer Support for processing.
        3.2.4.3.2. The SPS does not accept ARC transactions. Therefore, Customer Support
        must review the Supply Interface System (SIFS) residual file and change the
        transaction Document Identifier Code (DIC) to the appropriate follow-up transaction
        DIC prior to submission to Base Contracting. Customer Support will contact BCO to
        obtain current status for local purchase requisitions that have produced ARC output
        transactions.
        3.2.4.3.3. If the local purchase requirement no longer exists, Customer Support will
        process LCC transactions to cancel local purchase due-in details. Local procedures
        will be established between Customer Support and Base Contracting to ensure prompt
        action is taken on ILS-S local purchase requisition ARC transactions.
        3.2.4.3.4. Once ARC transactions have been produced, no other automated follow-up
        (AF*) transactions will be produced by the ILS-S.
        3.2.4.3.5. New ARC transactions are programmatically created every 10 days until
        updated status is processed in the ILS-S, or local purchase requisitions are canceled.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       59


  3.2.5. Local Purchase Requisition Reconciliation.
     3.2.5.1. Purpose: To reconcile Local Purchases between the ILS-S and SPS. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     3.2.5.2. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel will process the Local
     Purchase SPS Reconciliation Program (NGV583) quarterly to perform a complete
     reconciliation of requisitions between SPS and the ILS-S. All ILS-S local purchase due-
     in details are reconciled, except those with status codes Z2 (overseas foreign
     procurement) and Z3 (valid description required). If large numbers of mismatched
     records exist, local management may schedule local purchase reconciliations more often.
     3.2.5.3. Production of Local Purchase Reconciliation Header /Local Purchase
     Reconciliation Transactions. Prior to conducting reconciliations, the Local Purchase
     Reconciliation Header transaction is produced. The Local Purchase Reconciliation
     Header transaction provides the SPS the base PIIN and SRAN. Customer Support must
     contact the BCO to obtain the correct contracting installation numbers used for the
     reconciliation. See Local Purchase Reconciliation Header (1LH) Transaction in AFH
     23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for format and processing procedures for the Local Purchase
     Reconciliation Header transaction.
     3.2.5.4. After the Local Purchase Reconciliation Header is created, a Local Purchase
     Reconciliation transaction output image will be produced for all local purchase
     requisitions contained in the ILS-S. If status is loaded in the ILS-S for the requisition, the
     Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction will provide corresponding status to
     contracting. See Local Purchase Reconciliation (1LP) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol
     2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for format and processing information for the Local Purchase Reconciliation
     transaction.
     3.2.5.5. LRS/Materiel Management Activity Reconciliation Processing.               Customer
     Support will request program SPS Due-in Reconciliation Listing.
     3.2.5.6. BCO Reconciliation Processing.          BCO processes the Local Purchase
     Reconciliation Header transaction header to build a table of the SRANs being reconciled.
     Once the SRAN table is built, the SPS processes the reconciliation output transactions as
     follows:
         3.2.5.6.1. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction record matches the SPS
         file exactly, no response will be provided to the ILS-S. The requisition data will be
         printed on the Reconciliation Matched Listing.
         3.2.5.6.2. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction matches SPS, but the
         estimated delivery date differs, the SPS sends the ILS-S a Local Purchase Status
         Change EDD transaction update. The requisition data will be printed on the
         Reconciliation Matched Listing.
         3.2.5.6.3. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction matches SPS, but status is
         different, the SPS will create a local purchase status or local purchase adjustment
         transaction for ILS-S processing and update. The requisition data will be printed on
         the Reconciliation Matched Listing.
60                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        3.2.5.6.4. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction matches SPS, but SPS
        shows the requisition was canceled, the SPS will generate a new local purchase
        cancellation transaction to cancel the requisition in the ILS-S. The requisition will
        print on the Reconciliation Matched Listing.
        3.2.5.6.5. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction does not match SPS and
        the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction does not contain BD (delayed) status,
        the SPS will generate an MILSTRIP Status transaction with BF (no record) status for
        ILS-S requisition update action. The requisition will print on the Reconciliation
        Unmatched Listing.
        3.2.5.6.6. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction does not match SPS and
        the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction indicates the contract was awarded, the
        SPS will generate a MILSTRIP Status transaction with B5 (updated status) status will
        be provided. The requisition will be printed on the Reconciliation Action Listing -
        Contracting.
        3.2.5.6.7. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction does not match SPS
        awarded contracts file, but the requisition has been received by SPS, the SPS will
        generate a MILSTRIP Status transaction with Z3 (description) status requesting
        additional item description from the ILS-S. The requisition will be printed on the
        Reconciliation Matched Listing.
        3.2.5.6.8. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction indicates requisition
        assignment to Contracting personnel in SPS, but the requisition has been awarded or
        suspended for further information, the SPS will generate a MILSTRIP Status
        transaction with BD (delayed) status for the ILS-S. The requisition will print on the
        Reconciliation Matched Listing.
        3.2.5.6.9. If the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction and SPS indicate BD
        (delayed) status, the SPS will print this item on the Reconciliation Action Listing –
        Contracting. This action indicates offline research is required for this requisition by
        contracting.
        3.2.5.6.10. If a SRAN is listed in the Local Purchase Reconciliation Header and no
        Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction is received for records contained in SPS, a
        listing of all the records SPS contains for that account will be printed on the
        Reconciliation Action Listing - for offline research by the LRS/Materiel Management
        Activity.
     3.2.5.7. LRS/Materiel Management Activity Investigation of Mismatched Records.
     Upon receipt of the Reconciliation Unmatched Listing and Reconciliation Action Listing,
     Customer Support will take the following actions:
        3.2.5.7.1. Identify the Problem. Customer Support personnel will review the
        Reconciliation Action Listing - and check all mismatched records found during the
        reconciliation to find out what caused the problem and take all necessary actions.
        3.2.5.7.2. Verify the Local Purchase Requisition. If the requisition is for a valid
        requirement, LRS/Materiel Management Activity will process a SPR to load the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   61


        requisition. Additionally, all necessary MILSTRIP Supply Status transaction inputs
        will be processed to correct ILS-S due-in details.
        3.2.5.7.3. Received Requisition. If the requisition was received, process a local
        purchase receipt acknowledgement transaction and notify Contracting. See SPS
        Local Purchase Receipt Acknowledgment (1RA) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
        Pt 1, Ch 3 for 1RA transaction format and processing instructions.
        3.2.5.7.4. Canceled Requisition. If the requisition was canceled, process an AC*
        transaction and notify Contracting.         See Requisition Cancellation Request
        (AC1/AK1) Output Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for AC*
        transaction format and processing instructions.
     3.2.5.8. Contracting Investigation of Mismatched Records. The Contracting Office will
     review the Reconciliation Action Listing - Contracting, to determine the cause for
     mismatched records. Contracting personnel may request Customer Support’s assistance
     in correcting their records. Some of the more common requests will be for stock number
     change transactions, and research of supply records to assist in correction of local
     purchase requisition mismatches.
     3.2.5.9. Local Purchase Reconciliation Management Reports. A suspense will be
     established to assure the reconciliation is completed not more than 10 days after receipt.
     After completion of actions by both the BCO and the LRS/Materiel Management
     Activity , a meeting between the two offices will be held to assure all required system
     inputs are completed and the reconciliation listings are properly documented. To assure
     management personnel are aware of LRS/Materiel Management Activity and Contracting
     interface problems, the results of the local purchase reconciliation process will be
     reviewed, dated, and signed by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity Materiel
     Management Officer and the Chief, Management Analysis Flight in the Base Contracting
     Office. Once the listing is signed it will be filed and any previous listings may be
     destroyed.
     3.2.5.10. Using the Integrated Accounts Payable System (IAPS) Billed Not Received
     (BNR) Follow-up To Supply for Receiving Report. This report identifies items that have
     a vendor bill presented for payment, but the receipt has not processed by the ILS-S. Use
     this listing to reconcile vendor bills with LRS/Materiel Management Activity receiving
     records. Local purchase items will appear on the listing 7 days after the vendor bill is
     received and processed in BCO.
        3.2.5.10.1. LRS/Materiel Management Activity Processing Actions. The Customer
        Support will process document number inquiries on all items. If the local purchase
        due-in detail is on file in the ILS-S, annotate the listing with the current status and
        EDD. If a Received Not Billed (RNB) detail is on file indicating LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity receipt processing, annotate the listing with RNB and the
        DOLT from the RNB detail. If no detail exists in the ILS-S for the requisition
        document number, perform a transaction history from the current Julian date back to
        the original date the requisition was established. Note: Use the document number
        date in most cases to establish the date of requisition creation. If the local purchase
        due-in was previously canceled, annotate the listing with cancellation status and date.
        If the item was previously received, annotate the listing with the word “Received”
62                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        and “Date.” If no record of the local purchase requisition is found during transaction
        history research, annotate the listing with the statement “No Record of Due-In.”
  3.2.6. Local Purchase Open Item List.
     3.2.6.1. Purpose: For bases not supported by the SPS, the Local Purchase Open Item
     List provides a means to determine and/or verify the status of purchase orders with the
     BCO. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance
     use AFH 23-123.
     3.2.6.2. Bases supported by the SPS may eliminate the manual Local Purchase Order
     File in Receiving. SPS supported bases are not required to complete the actions in the
     subparagraphs listed below; however, all other actions are required. The LRS CC/AO
     may assign Customer Support Liaison and Funds Management responsibilities listed
     below as deemed necessary to effectively and efficiently accomplish the tasks.
     3.2.6.3. Funds Management Actions. Funds Management will receive three copies of the
     Local Purchase Open Item List and send one copy to Receiving and one copy to
     Customer Support.
     3.2.6.4. Customer Support Liaison Actions. Within 10 workdays of receiving the
     annotated list from Receiving, Stock Control will complete the following actions:
        3.2.6.4.1. Obtain Missing DD Form 1155, Order for Supplies or Services and DD
        Form 1348-1A. If Receiving annotated the listing indicating missing DD Forms 1155
        and 1348-1A, Customer Support will obtain the forms from Contracting and send to
        Receiving.
        3.2.6.4.2. Determine Status of Unlisted Purchase Orders. Customer Support will
        contact Contracting to determine the status of unlisted purchase orders on the open
        item listing. If a purchase order was canceled, Customer Support personnel will
        advise Receiving to close the file. Otherwise, Customer Support will update local
        purchase due-in and status detail records in the ILS-S.
        3.2.6.4.3. Screen BNR Details for Processing Errors. Customer Support will ensure
        that BNR detail records are screened against the document files and transaction
        history records. Customer Support will act to reconcile any corresponding due-out
        detail records with the customer if required. Customer Support will initiate action
        with the appropriate section to correct any errors.
        3.2.6.4.4. Process the Annotated Listing. The open item list will be annotated with
        actions taken and one copy provided to Funds Management. Customer Support will
        retain one copy of the annotated listing to avoid duplicate research actions on the next
        listing.
     3.2.6.5. Final Funds Management Actions. After receiving the annotated list from
     Customer Support, Funds Management will perform the following actions:
        3.2.6.5.1. Check Signed Invoices. Funds Management personnel will identify BNR
        detail records which Accounting and Finance contains a signed invoice. Funds
        Management will initiate action with the appropriate sections to ensure a receipt
        (REC) and request for special inventory (1GP) transactions are processed. The
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     63


         signed invoice will be used as supporting documentation for any inventory
         adjustment transaction processed.
         3.2.6.5.2. Check for Proof of Delivery. Funds Management personnel will contact
         Accounting and Finance for proof of delivery for each BNR detail record. Once
         obtained, Funds Management will forward proofs of delivery to Receiving for receipt
         transaction (REC) and special inventory (1GP) processing. Funds Management will
         identify which BNR detail records reflect Records Reversal in the purchase order
         number columns and determine why receipts were not reprocessed correctly.
   3.2.7. Other Local Purchase Management Reports and Notices.
      3.2.7.1. Purpose: The following paragraphs describe some of the other products that
      may be used to ensure the LRS/Materiel Management Activity and contracting
      requisition records match. Aside from the quarterly local purchase requisition
      reconciliation process, there are a number of other local purchase management reports
      and notices produced. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
      specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      3.2.7.2. Holdover listing. Each day, SPS produces the Holdover Listing. This listing
      identifies supply local purchase requisitions “held over” because either the stock number
      and/or descriptive data are not loaded in the SPS system. The LRS/Materiel Management
      Activity should use this listing to identify items with status statements “NEW ITEM” and
      “NEW PRI.” These status statements indicate there is a mismatch between contracting
      and the LRS/Materiel Management Activity records that must be corrected before further
      procurement action is taken. The correct course of action is to obtain and load all of the
      item and associated descriptive data into SPS using the AF Contracting Information
      System (AFCIS) (https://afcis.ssg.gunter.af.mil/1IL). Loading this information into the
      contracting system will allow procurement action to continue.
      3.2.7.3. Item listing. The Item Listing is printed as required. This listing identifies all
      stock numbers currently loaded in the SPS database. Note: The listing is printed in stock
      number, part number, and nomenclature sequence. The LRS/Materiel Management
      Activity personnel use the Item Listing to research part numbers for local purchase
      customer requests when the SPS system is not available.
      3.2.7.4. Error notices. SPS error notices are produced when an error condition is
      detected during SPS processing. Error notices resulting from the LRS/Materiel
      Management Activity inputs are normally sent back to the ILS-S for correction. Supply
      will correct the error and then return the error notice to the BCO for reprocessing.
      Contact Base Contracting for explanations of Supply error notices and associated
      corrective actions.
      3.2.7.5. Procurement notices. If supply requisition, status, and other transactions do not
      meet UMMIPS standards, the SPS system creates Procurement Notices. For some
      Procurement Notices, the LRS/Materiel Management Activity may have to correct the
      specific problem. Contact Base Contracting for explanations of Procurement Notices and
      associated corrective actions.

3.3. Receipt Processing.
   3.3.1. Local Manufacture Receipts.
       3.3.1.1. Purpose: To explain the local manufacture receipt procedures process. For
       policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and additional information, AFI 24-203.
       3.3.1.2. In order to reduce transportation and handling costs, LRS/Materiel Management
       Activity FSC will process receipts for local manufacture items. All other receipts should
       be processes by Distribution personnel. Materiel Receipt Acknowledgement Notice
       (DRA) is not produced for local manufacture (JBD) receipts.
       3.3.1.3. Upon receipt of a work order request (DD Form 1348-1A) and manufactured
       items received from a base maintenance activity, the following actions will be performed:
          3.3.1.3.1. Receipts Due-In. Local manufacture receipts will be processed as receipts
          due-in. Ensure the form contains the requisition number assigned (See Sec. 5B,
          Order and Requisitioning of this manual for procedures to establish a requisition
          number).
          3.3.1.3.2. Acknowledge receipt by forwarding a receipted copy of the work order
          request to the maintenance activity. The remaining copies of the work order request
          will be used as a receiving document.
          3.3.1.3.3. Process the receipt transaction in the ILS-S (see AFI 24-203 for receipt
          format).
          3.3.1.3.4. Credit Determination. Credit will not be allowed on local manufacture
          items unless they are a part of the SMAG (budget code 9). Contact Customer Support
          Section to determine if credit is allowed. If the local manufacture receipts are for
          SMAG items, the receipts must contain a Y in position 45. The organization and shop
          code of the fabricating activity must appear in positions 46-50. The total cost (actual
          or estimated) of all items used to fabricate the end item must appear on the receipt
          document. The total cost must be divided by the number of units to obtain the cost
          which is also the input cost. Based on the input unit price, credit will be provided to
          the fabricating activity. The unit cost, not the total cost, is to be entered in positions
          74-80 of the receipt input.
   3.3.2. Receipt Acknowledgement.
       3.3.2.1. Purpose: To describe the automated processes and transactions used by the ILS-
       S to acknowledge receipt processing and to respond to follow-ups from wholesale
       activities. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
       guidance use AFH 23-123.
       3.3.2.2. The ILS-S acknowledges receipts with wholesale activities through two distinct
       automated methods. See Receipt Acknowledgement and Follow-Up in AFH 23-123, Vol
       2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for additional information on Receipt Acknowledgement.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     65


                                          Chapter 4

                          MAKE AND MAINTAIN MATERIEL

Section 4A—Overview

4.1. Overview. This chapter outlines AF guidance to complete supply chain materiel
management processes associated with the making and maintaining of materiel. These processes
include Time Compliance Technical Order; Repair and Time Change Items. For this chapter,
DoD 4140.1-R, serves as a primary DoD reference source.

Section 4B—Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO)

4.2. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO)
   4.2.1. TCTO Compliance.
       4.2.1.1. Purpose: To identify assets requiring TCTO compliance. For policy specific
       requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
       4.2.1.2. Accurate management of Time Compliance Technical Order’s is key to upgrade
       of end items such as aircraft, missiles, vehicles and equipment used to support these
       platforms.
       4.2.1.3. Items requiring TCTO compliance will be identified in one of two ways: Items
       requiring modifications which change their form, fit, or function will be assigned NPPC
       4. Items requiring issue to Maintenance for modification and then returned under the
       same stock number will be assigned the TCTO flag.
          4.2.1.3.1. Identified during receipt processing. When receipts are processed that
          require TCTO compliance, the phrase “TCTO MODIFICATION REQUIRED” will
          be printed on line 4 of the bin notice. Inspectors will determine whether the TCTO
          has been complied with, if it has not, an inspector will issue the item to Maintenance
          using procedures outlined in Para 5.2.2. of this manual.
          4.2.1.3.2. Identified on Shipping Document. When a shipping document contains
          “TCTO MOD REQ'D” in block 27 of the DD Form 1348-1A, or line 16 of the DD
          Form 1348-1A (computer generated) or the IT produced label, the inspector will take
          one of the following actions:
       4.2.1.4. Tag all items in storage requiring TCTO modification with a DD Form 1576,
       Test/Modification Tag - Materiel, as specified in TO 00-20-3, Maintenance Processing of
       Reparable Property and the Repair Cycle Asset Control System. Pull modified assets (if
       they are available) upon receipt of an issue document containing the phrase "TCTO
       MODIFICATION MAY BE REQUIRED." Contact the customer if only unmodified
       assets are available to see if an unmodified item is acceptable.
          4.2.1.4.1. If TCTO modification will result in a change in the form, fit (specification
          of size), or function, the item will be reidentified and assigned a new NSN. The
          inspector will load a numeric parts preference code (NPPC) of 4 to the NSN.
              4.2.1.4.1.1. Assignment and Retention of NPPC 4. NPPC 4 is assigned either
66                                                 AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


     through 1) the AFMC Interchangeability and Substitution Edit and Suspense
     System (D043B) or 2) a Stock Control Data-Load/Change/Delete input found in
     Procedures for Stock Control Data – Load/Change/Delete Input (FCD) in AFH
     23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 2. Inspection personnel will ensure NPPC 4 is retained
     until the item record is deleted to identify spares requiring TCTO modification
     that may have been received after the initial inspection.
     4.2.1.4.1.2. Conditions Causing the Deletion of NPPC 4. NPPC 4 is normally
     retained on the item record until the record is deleted. The following conditions
     may cause deletion of the NPPC 4 from the item record before the item is deleted:
        4.2.1.4.1.2.1. AFMC Cataloging Transaction. When a cataloging transaction
        from AFMC removes the NPPC 4, the material management IT system will
        automatically produce a TCTO Code management notice with the phrase
        “D043B UPDATE” in the remarks field. If LRS/Materiel Management
        Activity inspectors believe the code was removed in error and the item in
        question meets the criteria for assigning the NPPC 4, they assign a TCTO flag
        and contact the applicable ALC Technical Service Branch.
          4.2.1.4.1.2.1.1. If the ALC Technical Service Branch determines the item
          requires TCTO, process a Stock Control Data Input to load NPPC 4 found in
          AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8.
          4.2.1.4.1.2.1.2. If the ALC Technical Service Branch determines the NPPC
          4 is not applicable, Stock Control will delete NPPC 4. Inspection personnel
          will ensure DD Form 1576 is removed from the item.
          4.2.1.4.1.2.1.3. Delete the TCTO flag once the ALC Technical Service
          Branch resolves the issue.
        4.2.1.4.1.2.2. Stock Control Data Input to change or delete NPPC 4.
        4.2.1.4.1.2.3. Conflict with AFMC D043B. If the NPPC 4 was assigned
        locally with Stock Control Data Input but the AFMC D043B system does not
        yet contain the correct parts preference code, cataloging actions from D043B
        processing may remove the NPPC 4. When the NPPC 4 is removed, a TCTO
        Code management notice with the phrase “D043B UPDATE” in the remarks
        field will be produced.
          4.2.1.4.1.2.3.1. Inspection personnel may contact the applicable ALC
          Technical Service Branch and/or AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
          Activity and provide a copy of the TCTO for NSN requiring NPPC 4
          cataloging activity.
          4.2.1.4.1.2.3.2. Inspection personnel will load the TCTO flag to the item
          record of the item in question in order to maintain control of the item until
          the issue is resolved.
          4.2.1.4.1.2.3.3. Once the D043B records have been updated, the ILS-S will
          automatically produce a TCTO Code management notice and the procedures
          in this section will be followed.
          4.2.1.4.1.2.3.4. Inspection personnel will now delete the TCTO flag.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  67


        4.2.1.4.2. Items requiring TCTO modification for reasons other than having changed
        in form, fit, or function do not qualify for NPPC 4, they will be assigned a TCTO
        Flag using the Stock Control Data Input found in Loading, updating, and processing
        NPPCs in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 to prevent issue of unmodified items. These
        items will be issued to Maintenance for modification and then returned under the
        same stock number.
            4.2.1.4.2.1. Assignment and Retention of the TCTO Flag. The TCTO flag is
            assigned through the Stock Control Data-Load/Change/Delete input. Retain the
            TCTO flag on the applicable item records until the recession date of the TCTO.
     4.2.1.5. TCTO Code Management Notices. When an NPPC 4 is loaded to an item record
     a TCTO Code management notice will be produced. Upon receipt of the TCTO Code
     management notice, the materiel management inspector will determine the availability of
     the TCTO publication.
        4.2.1.5.1. Check TCTO Publication Files. If the TCTO publication is already
        available in the Inspector’s TCTO publication file then appropriate procedures will be
        followed. If the TCTO publication is not available, contact the Maintenance Plans
        Scheduling and Documentation to obtain the TCTO publication.
        4.2.1.5.2. TCTO not Available. If maintenance has no record of the TCTO
        publication requiring assignment of NPPC 4 to the item, the Inspector must contact
        HQ AFMC/LGSI to obtain the TCTO number. When the Inspector obtains the TCTO
        number, immediately provide it to Base Maintenance Plans Scheduling and
        Documentation, to requisition the required TCTO publication. Technical data may
        also be obtained by contacting the applicable ALC’s Technical Service
        Division/Branch.
     4.2.1.6. Control of Items Requiring TCTO Kits. Items requiring TCTO kits will not be
     issued to maintenance for modification until the kits are available and maintenance has
     requested them. When maintenance returns the modified item, enter the TCTO number
     in the remarks block of the DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag. Annotate the form to
     indicate TCTO compliance.
     4.2.1.7. Monthly Verification of TCTO Items On-the-Shelf. Each month Inspection
     personnel must verify stocked items assigned either NPPC 4 or the TCTO flag comply
     with TCTOs. Inspection personnel will ensure all assets are inspected. Outputs or
     listings should be produced in warehouse and detail location sequence to facilitate
     inspections.
     4.2.1.8. TCTO Compliance Undetermined. When the LRS/Materiel Management
     Activity Inspection personnel cannot determine if an item complies with a TCTO, use
     activity code “C” to issue the item to Maintenance for inspection. Maintenance performs
     the necessary tests or inspections to determine if the item complies with the TCTO.
     4.2.1.9. If the item does not comply and the appropriate TCTO publication is not
     available maintenance will request the TCTO publication. LRS/Materiel Management
     Activity Inspection personnel will assign the TCTO flag to the item to control it until
     Maintenance receives the TCTO/disposition instructions. Once Maintenance receives the
     TCTO publication, normal TCTO processing takes place.
68                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        4.2.1.9.1. If the item does comply with the TCTO, ensure it is tagged appropriately.
  4.2.2. TCTO Kit Management.
     4.2.2.1. Purpose: To explain TCTO kit management. For policy specific requirements
     review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.2.2. General procedures to identify TCTO kit management actions.
        4.2.2.2.1. Due-outs for TCTO kits are not released automatically. Receipt processing
        of TCTO kits produces a notice to stock and a TCTO availability notice. The notice
        indicates the total on-hand balance and all existing due-out detail record. All TCTO
        kits and all copies of the I029 management notice are forwarded to the LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity TCTO Kit Manager. To ensure a TCTO asset availability
        notice is produced, personnel will not enter a bypass due-out release TEX code on the
        receipt input.
        4.2.2.2.2. TCTO Kit Receipts
            4.2.2.2.2.1. Receiving Base Assembled TCTO Kits. As base assembled TCTO
            kits are completed, the LRS/Materiel Management Activity TCTO Kit Manager
            prepares a receiving document on DD Form 1348-1A. The receiving document
            will include routing identifier code JBD and the appropriate due-in requisition
            document number. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity TCTO Kit Manager
            signs the receiving document to indicate the TCN, NSN, and number of kits stated
            in the quantity field has in fact been completed. Flight Service Center picks
            up/signs for and processes all TCTO kits.
  4.2.3. TCTO Publications.
     4.2.3.1. Purpose: To explain the proper actions taken upon receipt of TCTO
     publications. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.3.2. General procedures for handling TCTO publications.
        4.2.3.2.1. Maintenance Quality Assurance will forward a copy of all TCTO
        publications (except for munitions) to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity
        inspectors and TCTO kit monitor. A copy will be filed in the applicable TCTO kit
        jacket file and used to manage items in stock which require modification. Maintain
        TCTO publications in TCTO number sequence.
     4.2.3.3. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity Inspector must do the following:
        4.2.3.3.1. Process Inquiry. Prepare an inquiry to list all item records, ISG related
        item records, and detail records for the listed stock numbers.
        4.2.3.3.2. Load NPPC 4 or TCTO Flag. Initiate action to load an NPPC 4 or TCTO
        Flag to the item record of the item to be modified. Enter the TCTO number in the
        source of restriction field (pos. 49-80) of the Stock Control Data-Load/Change/Delete
        input.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   69


         4.2.3.3.3. Tag materiel awaiting TCTO modification with DD Form 1576 series. Use
         the stock number or part number physically located on the asset as the source
         identification.
         4.2.3.3.4. Load suspect item flag to items assigned NPPC 4 or TCTO flag to ensure
         assets are properly inspected/tagged prior to releasing to stock or due-out release.
         4.2.3.3.5. Determine Total Kit Requirement. Determine the number of TCTO kits
         needed to modify base stocks. Take inventory of all unmodified spares on hand,
         including serviceable, unserviceable, readiness spares packages, and supply points.
         4.2.3.3.6. Review of Due-Ins. If the modification does NOT apply to specific serial
         numbered items, then due-in quantities that have been shipped or released for
         shipment will also be included in the total kit requirement. When the modification
         applies to specific serially numbered items, due-ins are not considered during the
         review. Requirements for serially numbered items will be determined upon their
         receipt from the depot.
         4.2.3.3.7. Correspondence. Send correspondence to forward supply points/locations,
         AC&W sites, relay sites, etc., when spares at those sites are to be modified. Forward
         the TCTO publication and a cover letter to these forward sites for their evaluation.
         Route the correspondence for AC&W sites and radio relay sites through the EACC.
         4.2.3.3.8. If the host base provides maintenance support for the forward base, include
         the number of assets at the forward base requiring modification in the total kit
         requirements.
         4.2.3.3.9. When compliance cannot be made at the forward base, the forward base
         requests replacement spares from the host base and returns unmodified spares to the
         host base for maintenance. The EACC will coordinate the return of unmodified
         spares for AC&W and radio relay sites. Send unmodified spares to Inspection, who
         then forwards them to maintenance for modification.
         4.2.3.3.10. Advising Maintenance. Upon completion of the above review, Inspection
         personnel will advise the appropriate maintenance activity of the total number of kits
         required to modify base stocks (and in transit items when applicable).
         4.2.3.3.11. Demand and Adjusted Stock Levels. If the technical order stipulates
         demand or adjusted stock levels be reduced or eliminated, advise the applicable Stock
         Control personnel to reduce or delete the adjusted stock level.
  4.2.4. Assembly of Kits.
     4.2.4.1. Purpose: To describe the base assembly of TCTO kits. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.4.2. General procedures to identify assembly of TCTO kits.
         4.2.4.2.1. The TCTO will normally indicate how the TCTO kit is to be assembled
         and directions for obtaining and funding the kit. Most TCTO kits are assembled at
         the wholesale level and provided free of charge to base units. However, the TCTO,
         AFMC, or HQ USAF may direct base assembly of TCTO kits. When base assembly
70                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         is directed and funds will be provided, the base will track expenditures as noted
         below.
         4.2.4.2.2. Billing Base-Assembled TCTO Kits. To make it easier to bill expenses
         incurred for the base assembly of TCTO kits, an Organization Cost Center Record
         (OCCR) and Project Funds Management Record (PFMR) are loaded for each kit
         and/or source of funds (such as OBAN, ALC, MAJCOM, etc.). Accounting and
         Finance (A&F) will load the PFMR, as specified by DFAS-DE 7077.10-M. The
         LRS/Materiel Management Activity will load the OCCR using an organization code
         in the 100-999 series and type organization code 3 as outlined Sec. 8B, Cataloging
         and Records Maintenance Procedures. The responsibility center/cost center code
         will be 99xxxx, as provided by A&F. Upon receiving authority to assemble a kit at
         base level, the LRS/Materiel Management Activity TCTO Kit Monitor will furnish
         A&F the TCTO kit number, the appropriate funding source, and the A&F disbursing
         station number.
         4.2.4.2.3. Inclusion of Unauthorized Materiel in TCTO Kits. When a modification
         requires materiel not authorized for inclusion in the kit, such as explosives,
         munitions, or medical items, the IM/SM responsible for the modification will provide
         appropriate funding for the required materiel to the activity developing or assembling
         the kit. Base funds will not be provided to buy items not normally included in TCTO
         kits. The costs for these items are included in the base's operating budget. The
         activity will then obtain the required materiel. All such items will be kitted separately
         and identified as part of the total TCTO kit so proper storage and safety measures can
         be taken.
         4.2.4.2.4. Deviations from the Complete Kit Policy. Deviations from the complete
         kit policy require waivers agreed to by the MAJCOM. Base level will accept the
         financial and manpower burden upon acceptance of a deviation from the complete kit.
         Host command LRS/Materiel Management activities will accept responsibility for kit
         buildup of incomplete TCTO kits waived by a tenant unit's MAJCOM. Items
         excluded from TCTO kits by waiver are acquired from existing organizational
         resources or purchased through regular supply channels. When the need is urgent and
         the using command has adequate materiel assets at another location, they will
         redistribute the materiel laterally to complete their TCTO kits.
  4.2.5. Establishment and Maintenance of TCTO Kit Files.
     4.2.5.1. Purpose: To explain the establishment and maintenance of the TCTO kit files.
     For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
     AFH 23-123.
     4.2.5.2. General procedures for filing completed TCTO kit files.
         4.2.5.2.1. Establishment and maintenance of TCTO Kit Files will be accomplished
         IAW AFI 23-101, Sec. 4B, TCTO.
     4.2.5.3. Completed TCTO Kit Files. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity TCTO Kit
     Monitor places the TCTO Kit file in the completed file when all balances have been
     reduced to zero and no requirements exist. The completed jacket file will be retained as
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   71


     specified in the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
     https://webrims.amc.af.mil.
  4.2.6. Establishment of TCTO Kit Item Records.
     4.2.6.1. Purpose: To identify procedures to establish the TCTO Kit item records. For
     policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
     23-123.
     4.2.6.2. General procedures governing TCTO Kit item records loads.
         4.2.6.2.1. Establishment of TCTO Kit Item Records. Upon notification from
         maintenance a new TCTO Kit is required the LRS/Materiel Management Activity
         TCTO Kit Monitor will request Records Maintenance load the item record. The item
         record will be assigned ERRCD XD2 and the appropriate Routing Identifier Code.
         4.2.6.2.2. Recoverable Assembly Management Process System (RAMP) Reporting.
         All TCTO kits assigned a depot RIC (e.g., FHZ, FLZ, F77, etc.) are included in the
         daily RAMP reports and are subject to depot management or redistribution.
  4.2.7. Identification of TCTO Kit Requirements.
     4.2.7.1. Purpose: To identify items requiring TCTO compliance. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.7.2. General procedures to identify TCTO requirements.
         4.2.7.2.1. Identification of TCTO Kit Requirements. Maintenance activities review
         incoming technical publications to determine the number of TCTO kits required.
         Usually, only one kit for each aircraft, missile, end item of equipment, spare part or
         component to be modified is authorized. The maintenance activity sends a copy of
         the technical order to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity inspection personnel to
         determine kit requirements for items in stock (and in transit when applicable).
  4.2.8. Releasing TCTO Kits to Maintenance.
     4.2.8.1. Purpose: To identify procedures for Releasing TCTO Kits to maintenance. For
     policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
     23-123.
  4.2.8.2. TCTO kits are ordered through the TCTO Kit Monitor. When complete kits are
  available for release to the user, the TCTO Kit Monitor processes a DOR at which time the
  TCTO kit may be distributed.
         4.2.8.2.1. Releasing TCTO Kits to maintenance. When TCTO kits are required, the
         following actions will be accomplished:
            4.2.8.2.1.1. The maintenance activity furnishes the TCTO Kit Monitor with a
            Maintenance IT system report listing specifying the technical order number and
            the serial number of the end item listed on the AF Form 2001, Notification of
            TCTO Kit Requirements. The TCTO Kit Monitor will process a force due-out
            release to the applicable due-out listed in the TCTO Jacket File using the
            procedures outlined in Sec. 5B, Order and Requisitioning of this publication.
            4.2.8.2.1.2. If a consolidated issue request has been used, the TCTO kit monitor
72                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            enters the quantity to be released and verifies the completeness of available kits
            (all components may not be available).
            4.2.8.2.1.3. If complete kits are available, the TCTO kit monitor prepares and
            processes a forced DOR using the procedures outlined in Ch 5 of this publication.
            4.2.8.2.1.4. When complete kits are not available, the TCTO kit monitor must
            advise maintenance of the current supply status of the items still required. The
            incomplete kits may be released at the option of the maintenance activity.
            4.2.8.2.1.5. The TCTO Kit Monitor enters the date of release for each TCTO kit
            on the AF Form 2001.
         4.2.8.2.2. Free Issue of TCTO Kits. Modification-driven TCTO kits will be free
         issued. Only one kit per asset requiring modification will be funded. When in-stock
         assets (RSP, POS, Supply Points, etc.) require modification, the asset will be issued
         using activity code “C” to the appropriate repair shop, and one TCTO kit for each
         asset requiring modification will be free issued to the appropriate repair shop as
         outlined in Sec. 5B, Order and Requisitioning of this publication.
         4.2.8.2.3. Exceptions. Non-modification driven TCTO kits and replacement kits or
         components for assets which are lost or used for purposes other than modification
         must be purchased using the organization's O&M funds unless type organization code
         3 is used.
  4.2.9. Storage and Control of TCTO Kits.
     4.2.9.1. Purpose: To describe the proper storage and control of TCTO kits. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.9.2. General procedures to establish controls to prevent the loss or unauthorized use
     of kits and their components.
         4.2.9.2.1. Shelf Life Monitoring. TCTO kits may contain shelf life items so each kit
         must be inspected to be certain the shelf life items listed in the TCTO bill of materials
         are still serviceable. The TCTO Kit Monitor will use kit stock numbers to control the
         shelf life items in the kits. When items become outdated, normal shelf life control
         procedures will apply. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity TCTO Kit Monitor
         tags kits containing outdated items with condition code E (limited restoration). The
         kits remain in this status until the outdated items have been replaced or shelf life has
         been extended.
            4.2.9.2.1.1. Type I items are replaced through normal requisitioning procedures.
            4.2.9.2.1.2. The Inspector will examine type II items and update the DD Forms
            1574, 1574-1, or DD Form 2477 on the containers. When the inspection is
            completed and/or when the outdated materiel is replaced, the kit will be assigned
            the appropriate supply condition code (A, B, or C).
         4.2.9.2.2. Items needing repair. TCTO kits found to contain items needing repair
         will be tagged condition code G (incomplete) by an authorized Inspector. The
         reparable items will be tagged condition code F (reparable) and turned in for repair.
         The LRS/Materiel Management Activity Inspector will notify the LRS/Materiel
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      73


         Management Activity TCTO Kit Monitor immediately to requisition replacements to
         return the kits to complete (issuable) status.
  4.2.10. Transferring TCTO Kits.
     4.2.10.1. Purpose: To describe procedures for transferring TCTO kits. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.10.2. General procedures to describe actions to transfer TCTO kits.
         4.2.10.2.1. Transferring TCTO Kits.           Maintenance Plans, Scheduling and
         Documentation (PS&D) will advise the TCTO Kit Monitor of impending transfers of
         aircraft or end items. This notice should be issued as far in advance of the transfers as
         possible in order to ship applicable TCTO kits with the aircraft or end items.
         4.2.10.2.2. PS&D will provide identification data, including date of transfer, specific
         TCTO number involved, destination base, type, and tail or identification number.
         4.2.10.2.3. The TCTO kit monitor determines: 1) the availability of the kits
         designated for transfer, and 2) the weight and cube of those kits (by estimation if
         exact figures are not available).
         4.2.10.2.4. The TCTO kit monitor prepares a degraded operations shipping document
         and Nondirected Shipment Transaction input for each kit being shipped, as outlined
         in Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure. The type of aircraft, end item of equipment, or tail
         identification number will be entered in Block V of the shipping document. The
         TCTO kit monitor will coordinate with the LRS/Transportation activity to establish
         the date the kits and shipping documents should be forwarded. After the
         LRS/Transportation activity has received and signed for the kits, the Nondirected
         Shipment Transaction input and document file copies will be processed. Upon
         shipment of the kits the TCTO kit monitor cancels all TCTO kit Due-Outs and Due-
         Ins for the transferred aircraft or end items, and, when applicable, annotates AF Form
         2001 to show the cancellation and shipment.
         4.2.10.2.5. Once the TCTO kit monitor has completed the shipment, it advises the
         consignee (ship-to SRAN) LRS CC/AO by message that the TCTO kits are being
         shipped with the transferred aircraft or end items of equipment. This message will
         include the TCTO kit stock number, technical order number, quantity, shipping
         document number, type of aircraft or end item, tail or identification number, and
         mode of shipment.
         4.2.10.2.6. When the TCTO kit monitor at the consignee (ship-to SRAN) receives the
         shipping notice, they will work closely with the PS&D and the Materiel Management
         Flight, Vehicle Operations Element to make sure that all kits arriving with the aircraft
         or end items are delivered to the LRS, Receiving Section. The TCTO kit monitor and
         the PS&D will ensure that all outstanding kit requirements for the new aircraft and/or
         end items are properly recorded on AF Form 2001 and incorporated into the base
         TCTO kit system. If requested by PS&D, the TCTO kit monitor adds the new
         aircraft, end item, or identification number to any existing AF Form 2001. The
         PS&D will prepare and process a new AF Form 2001 if required by an outstanding
         TCTO.
74                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


  4.2.11. TCTO Kit Reconciliation and Status Report.
     4.2.11.1. Purpose: To describe procedures for TCTO kit reconciliation and status
     reporting. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.11.2. General procedures to describe steps taken for TCTO kit reconciliation and
     status reporting.
         4.2.11.2.1. TCTO Kit Reconciliation and Status Report.    The LRS/Materiel
         Management Activity and Maintenance will reconcile all TCTO kit assets and
         requirements as needed. The purpose of this reconciliation is to validate kit
         availability, shortages, excesses, due-outs, and due-ins.
            4.2.11.2.1.1. Local Program. Bases will process a locally developed program or
            an as-required report (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 16 and AFH 23-123, Vol
            2, Pt 4, Ch 4) to obtain reconciliation data from applicable ILS-S database
            records. The program should list data from the item record, due-out detail, due-in
            and status detail records. For example:
                4.2.11.2.1.1.1. Item Record (technical order number obtained from item
                record nomenclature field; TCTO kit stock number, on-hand serviceable
                balance; routing identifier code; and the unit cost).
                4.2.11.2.1.1.2. Due-out Detail Record (due-out document number; due-out
                mark for field; quantity due-out; urgency justification code).
                4.2.11.2.1.1.3. Due-in and Status Detail Records.
         4.2.11.2.2. Actions. The following actions are necessary:
            4.2.11.2.2.1. Maintenance will advise the TCTO Kit Monitor of all excesses
            found in the reconciliation.
            4.2.11.2.2.2. Maintenance will advise the TCTO Kit Monitor of tail number
            changes required in existing due-outs and of additional requirements not stated in
            the Reconciliation Listing.
            4.2.11.2.2.3. The TCTO Kit Monitor ensures all changes requested by
            Maintenance are processed.
         4.2.11.2.3. An actual face to face meeting will be held. The Materiel Management
         Officer, or a representative, chairs reconciliation meetings. As chair, the Materiel
         Management Officer determines attendance requirements for LRS/Materiel
         Management personnel. The MXG CC selects personnel to represent maintenance at
         the TCTO reconciliation meetings.
            4.2.11.2.3.1. Both the Materiel Management Officer and the Maintenance
            Control Officer must sign the TCTO Reconciliation Listing.
            4.2.11.2.3.2. The chair prepares the minutes and distributes them to the MX
            Group Commander and the LRS CC/AO within 5 working days. Both
            LRS/Materiel Management Activity and maintenance TCTO monitors will use
            the minutes or the Reconciliation Listing to administer the TCTO program.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   75


         4.2.11.2.4. Reporting of Excess Kits. Report excess kits to the IM by e-mail. IMs
         will provide disposition for excess kits. At the option of the MAJCOM, excess
         locally manufactured kits with routing identifier JBD will be reported to a command
         redistribution system for disposition instructions. If a command redistribution system
         does not exist then Maintenance will disassemble all excess locally assembled kits
         having routing identifier code JBD and will return the components to stock.
  4.2.12. Redistribution/Disassembly of TCTO Kits.
     4.2.12.1. Purpose: To describe procedures for the redistribution and/or disassembly of
     TCTO Kits. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.12.2. General procedures to describe actions taken to redistribute or disassemble
     TCTO kits.
         4.2.12.2.1. Redistribution/Disassembly of TCTO Kits. IMs use Redistribution
         Orders (RDO) to direct redistribution or disassembly of excess centrally managed
         TCTO kits; those with a routing identifier code (RIC) other than JBD.
            4.2.12.2.1.1. RDOs directing disassembly contain the constants YBRKDN in the
            supplementary address field.
            4.2.12.2.1.2. In lieu of disassembly, MAJCOMs may use non-directed shipment
            requests (SHP) to redistribute locally assembled kits with RIC of JBD.
            4.2.12.2.1.3. When kits are to be disassembled:
                4.2.12.2.1.3.1. The TCTO kit monitor will issue the kits to Maintenance.
                4.2.12.2.1.3.2. Upon disassembly of the kits, all components will be turned in
                to base stocks.
                4.2.12.2.1.3.3. The TCTO kit monitor will work closely with the appropriate
                Maintenance Materiel Control to ensure that all documents for turned-in,
                removed, or replaced parts are properly marked and controlled throughout the
                redistribution process.
  4.2.13. Re-Identification and Stock List Changes.
     4.2.13.1. Purpose: To describe procedures for the re-identification and stock list changes
     of assets after modification. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for
     IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     4.2.13.2. General procedures to identify steps taken when an asset is modified due to
     TCTO compliance.
         4.2.13.2.1. When a TCTO affects parts, subassemblies, assemblies, or complete
         articles to the extent that physical modification of the part is required, a new part
         number will be assigned and the national stock number (NSN) will be changed.
         However, when the TCTO requires a condition inspection to identify defects which

     4.2.13.7. End article IMs issuing TCTOs will promptly notify the applicable cataloging
     activity to have expedited change actions initiated. Prompt re-identification changes in
     the next AF stock list change or AF service supplement change cycles, and any changes
     to the MCR-1 publication file will be accomplished. It is the intent to issue the applicable
     stock list change notice concurrently with release of the routine TCTO.
     4.2.13.8. Upon determining applicability of the TCTO, the Maintenance Plans,
     Scheduling and Documentation Section will immediately furnish an action copy of the
     TCTO to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. The LRS CC/AO will use the

     requisitions for validity of end item application as a controlled exception, and apply
     management codes as required IAW Para 4.2.14 of this publication.
  4.2.14. Management Coding On Supply Records.
     4.2.14.1. Purpose: To describe procedures for the management coding on supply records
     . For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
     AFH 23-123
     4.2.14.2. General procedures to outline coding on Supply Records for TCTO kits.
        4.2.14.2.1. All TCTO kits will be assigned manager review code "L" per AFMC
        guidance. This degree of management gives visibility of transactions and requires
        positive manager action before any shipments are made. This control is required to
        insure that kits are not used for unauthorized requirements. The visibility of actions
        assists the Technical Content Manager (TCM) in the release of backorders to
        maintain the TCTO schedule. IMs will coordinate with applicable MAJCOM TCTO
        Kit Manager(s) prior to force release actions to ship kits. The TCM(s) will document
        coordination actions in the TCTO kit management files.
     4.2.14.3. All items/spares affected by TCTOs that jeopardize life, safety of flight, and
     condemnation/mutilation will be assigned manager review code "T" per AFMC guidance.
     This degree of management gives visibility of transactions and requires positive manager
     action before any shipments are made. This control is required to prevent wrong
     spares/items from being issued to a user and to insure that critical parts affecting safety

      that have been removed by a TCTO are not reissued to maintenance for the same
      application. Manager review codes will be assigned to those affected items immediately
      upon receipt and processing of AFMC Form 874, Time Compliance Technical Order
      Supply Data Requirements, and AFMC Form 172, Coordination of Proposed Technical
      Order, and the manager review code will remain in place during the life of the TCTO.
      4.2.14.4. Items identified for removal and mutilated to prevent inadvertent reinstallation
      will be processed as follows:
          4.2.14.4.1. Assign manager review code "T."
          4.2.14.4.2. Determine approximate number of items in the ILS-S and prepare an
          AFMC Form 206 Temporary Work Request to have these items mutilated and/or
          salvaged. Items containing precious metal should be mutilated and all scrap residue
          processed to disposal. These items will be processed to the DLADS in accordance
          with the Precious Metals Recovery Program.
          4.2.14.4.3. When the AFMC Form 206 is approved and the work center that will do
          the mutilation/ salvage is known, the TCM will establish a maintenance contact for
          the work center; this will allow the work center to be notified of any subsequent items
          that generate into the ILS-S. The TCM of the item being mutilated will prepare a save
          list and coordinate it through the Product Director for use by the work center that is
          required to do the mutilation and/or salvage operation.
          4.2.14.4.4. A priority book message will be prepared to all LRS/Materiel
          Management Activities using "Safety of Flight Warning" as the subject. The message
          will require mutilation/salvage of the item and will give directions for accomplishing
          the mutilation/salvage operation. This message will require an answer, giving the
          number of items salvaged or mutilated or a negative reply "No assets this activity."
          4.2.14.4.5. The TCM will review procurement records. If it is determined that a
          production contract is in existence, the Directorate of Procurement will be advised
          and requested to stop all production, and to hold the contract in abeyance until
          work/re-identification/disposition can be determined and formalized.
          4.2.14.4.6. The Item Manager Wholesale Requisition Process (IMWRP) D035A
          subsystem records will be file maintained with a constant reject code "CJ" according
          to AFMC guidance.
          4.2.14.4.7. An AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action will be prepared
          and submitted by the TCM IAW Sec. 8B, Cataloging and Records Maintenance
          Procedures of this manual, to have the item cataloged as obsolete in the federal
          supply system.
      4.2.14.5. All TCTO kits will be assigned ERRCD "XD2." This designator is used in
      accounting records, to insure that all TCTO kit identification numbers assigned by the
      ALCs are reported in the RAMPS/D035C, regardless of unit cost, for management
      control.

         sequence. Both an open and closed file will be maintained. Once disposition
         instructions are received and actions taken, move the suspense jacket file from the
         open to the closed file. The closed folders will be maintained IAW the file plan.
         4.3.8.2.4. Verify Current Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) Status/Location.
         LRS/Materiel Management activities will monitor status of PQDR assets using the
         Repair Cycle Management listing. Procedures for updating DIFM status/location can
         be found in Para 4.3.3 of this manual.
  4.3.9. Base Contract Maintenance.
     4.3.9.1. Purpose: To explain the management of base contract maintenance items. For
     policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
     23-123.
     4.3.9.2. General Management of Base Contract Maintenance Procedures. LRS/Materiel
     Management activities will follow the procedures outlined in Base Contract Maintenance
     in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 4.
  4.3.10. Calibration Repair and Return (CRR).
     4.3.10.1. Purpose: This procedure covers the return, receipt, and evacuation of items for
     CRR. It also presents procedures for processing CRR documents for input/output,
     requisitions, and termination of accountability. Special instructions for Non-MILSTRIP
     shipments for Test Measurement Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) items to an off-base
     support Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) are also covered.
     4.3.10.2. Off-Base Calibration/Repair/Return. At times, property must be sent to off-
     base locations for calibration/repair and return.             Vendors, contractors, and
     calibration/repair activities (with the exception of the calibration/repair activities at the
     computer support base) are considered off-base. LRS/Materiel Management Activity
     procedures for processing property for calibration/repair and return are outlined below.
     These procedures do not apply to AFMC-managed XD/XF items, except when directed
     to return them directly to the contractor under warranty programs. Note: Do not use
     these procedures to ship small arms (CIC N or 4) under any conditions.
         4.3.10.2.1. These procedures document the movement of property from the customer
         through the ILS-S and back to the customer without charging O&M funds.
         4.3.10.2.2. Inputs to System. Inputs to the system must contain project code 440,
         PACER SHELL. This project code identifies equipment and materiel not on a
         maintenance scheduling and control system.
     4.3.10.3. Return of Equipment for Calibration, Repair, and Return.
         4.3.10.3.1. Tagging of Equipment. The custodian will ensure equipment is properly
         tagged with an AFTO Form 350 and the tag is clearly marked
         CALIBRATION/REPAIR AND RETURN.
84                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        4.3.10.3.2. Requesting Preparation for Repair and Return of equipment. The
        custodian will contact the EAE to request preparation of a repair and return (TRIC
        RAR) input.
           4.3.10.3.2.1. Preparing the Repair and Return Input Document. EAE will prepare
           a repair and return (TRIC RAR) input document. The document number for
           equipment will be the existing authorized/in-use detail document number, with
           activity code E and the current date entered in positions 36-39. If no
           authorized/in-use detail record exists, then the document number will be the next
           available number from the control register (but the activity code must be E). See
           Calibration/Repair and Return Request in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 4 for
           document and input transaction format.
           4.3.10.3.2.2. Preparing the RAR Input Document for EMC-1 Items. For EMC-1
           items an activity code P will be automatically assigned by the program if no
           authorized/in-use detail is loaded. This ensures that the due-out detail record is
           established with an activity code P. The prepared RAR may be input through any
           terminal or the RPS/main system. See Calibration/Repair and Return Request in
           AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 4 for document and input transaction format.
     4.3.10.4. Return of Expendable Items (Except For AFMC Managed XD/XF) for
     Calibration, Repair, and Return.
        4.3.10.4.1. Cleaning and Tagging. The user will ensure that the item is clean and
        properly tagged.
        4.3.10.4.2. Requesting Preparations for Repair and Return. The user will contact
        Customer Support and request preparation of a repair and return (TRIC RAR) input.
        4.3.10.4.3. Preparing the RAR Input Document. Customer Support will prepare a
        repair and return (TRIC RAR) input document (see Calibration/Repair and Return
        Request in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 4). The document number will contain
        activity code P. The prepared RAR may be input through any terminal or the
        RPS/main system.
     4.3.10.5. Reverse-Posting Unauthorized.   Reverse-posting of TRIC RAR is not
     authorized. If, for any reason, the RAR was processed with invalid data, then do the
     following:
        4.3.10.5.1. Prepare and process a receipt (TRIC REC). Use TEX code 2 and the due-
        out document number created by the erroneous input in positions 60-73. (See AFI
        24-203 for additional information on REC processing.)
        4.3.10.5.2. Find and destroy the AOE that was produced for routing to the repair
        base.
        4.3.10.5.3. If the AOE has already been sent to the repair base, tell the repair base to
        process a TRIC DOC to cancel the lateral due-out.
     4.3.10.6. Special instructions for the movement of Non-MILSTRIP Shipments of
     TMDE.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    85


         4.3.10.6.1. These instructions apply to the movement of TMDE items, commonly
         referred to as Precision Measurement Equipment (PME), to an off-base support
         PMEL, to include Air Force Metrology Calibration Detachment when calibration,
         repair and return of the same items are required (TO 00-20-14, Air Force Metrology
         and Calibration Program).
         4.3.10.6.2. These items are not to be processed through supply channels.
         4.3.10.6.3. In certain circumstances, shippers may have an official need to move
         DoD materiel outside of normal MILSTRIP procedures. In those situations, the
         shipper provides authority for movement and is responsible for the integrity of the
         shipment.
         4.3.10.6.4. All non-MILSTRIP shipment requests will be tendered to the
         Transportation Officer (TO) on DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping
         Document. The shipper must also provide written authority for movement when
         requested by the TO.
         4.3.10.6.5. Instructions for the completion and distribution of DD Form 1149 are
         provided in AFI 24-203.
         4.3.10.6.6. The distribution activity will receive DD Form 1149 from
         maintenance/equipment custodian/PMEL and assign transportation priority. Entries
         on DD Form 1149 will be checked for accuracy and a signature in block 19 with a
         receipt copy to delivery personnel. The transportation activity will verify DD Form
         1149 documentation and package(s) to be shipped, and process the shipment as
         prescribed in applicable directives.

                                DELIVERY OF MATERIEL

Section 5A—Overview

5.1. Overview. This chapter outlines AF guidance to accomplish supply chain materiel
management processes associated with the delivery of materiel. These processes include Order
and Requisitioning; Physical Asset Management; Equipment Management; Document Control
and Detail Records, Record Reversal and Correction, Physical Inventory and Inventory
Adjustments; SPRAM; Inspection and Related Operations; and Materiel Disposition in DLM
4000.25-1, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP); DLM 4000.25-
2, Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP); DLM
4000.25-6, Department of Defense Activity Address Directory (DoDAAD) (Activity Address
Code Sequence); DoD 4140.1-R, and DoD 4140.27-M are reference sources for this chapter.

Section 5B—Ordering and Requisitioning.

5.2. Ordering and Requisitioning.
   5.2.1. Customer Issue Request and Processing.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose: To explain the customer issue request procedures process. For policy
       specific requirements, review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
       5.2.1.2. General Discussion: Most maintenance issue requests are processed directly
       from an external maintenance IT system (i.e., IMDS and G081). Processing instructions
       for those systems can be found in the applicable system handbooks. Customers requiring
       the LRS/Materiel Management Activity to directly input issue requests in the ILS-S will
       submit issue requests to the Customer Support. Various forms used to submit customer
       requests for materiel include: AF Form 2005; DD Form 1348-6; AF Form 601,
       Equipment Action Request; and AF Form 1445, Materials and Equipment List. Under
       certain circumstances, spreadsheets may be more practical than individual AF Forms
       2005. However, all processing requirements that apply to the AF Form 2005 equally
       apply to the spreadsheet. Note: For special type items and conditions, follow these
       procedures and the applicable steps identified in Para 5.2.2.
       5.2.1.3. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will take the following actions for
       customer issue requests:
          5.2.1.3.1. Process customer request IAW with Expendable Item Customer Issue
          Request (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements in AFH 23-123,
          Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Priority orders a typically ordered as "fill or kill".
              5.2.1.3.1.1. If the customer request is killed:
                 5.2.1.3.1.1.1. Contact the requestor to determine backorder priority.
                   5.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. If requestor desires to backorder asset MICAP, see Para
                   5.2.4
                   5.2.1.3.1.1.1.2. If requestor desires to backorder other than MICAP, process
88                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                  backorder IAW Customer Backorders in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
         5.2.1.3.2. For Non-Expendable equipment item customer requests, the Equipment
         Accountability Element (EAE) will:
            5.2.1.3.2.1. Verify if equipment accountability is necessary.
            5.2.1.3.2.2. For accountable (ERRCD NF(*)/ND(*) assets issues:
                5.2.1.3.2.2.1. Assign activity code E and process IAW Non-Expendable Item
                Customer Issue Request (ISU) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
                  5.2.1.3.2.2.1.1. Load item code U or M respectively to the authorized/in-use
                  detail record prior to issuing an unsatisfactory substitute or multiple
                  component substitute instead of an authorized item, see Equipment
                  Management File Maintenance: FCI Load in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch
                  5.
         5.2.1.3.3. For Non-Accountable Equipment Item Issues.
            5.2.1.3.3.1. Assign activity code P and process IAW Non-Expendable Item
            Customer Issue Request (ISU) Transaction Format and Processing Instructions in
            AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
         5.2.1.3.4. Input transaction and review output reject/management notice for further
         action:
            5.2.1.3.4.1. If asset issued, ensure transaction output processed to the applicable
            warehouse.
            5.2.1.3.4.2. If transaction rejected, see 316 REJ Authority For Issue Flag Blank
            or Invalid in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for corrective action and re-input
            transaction.
  5.2.2. Customer Issue Request and Processing of Special Type Items and Conditions.
     5.2.2.1. Purpose: To explain how to prepare and process customer issue requests for
     special type items and conditions. For policy specific requirements, review AFI 23-101
     and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.2.2.2. General Discussion: There are numerous categories of items and circumstances
     where normal (automated) ILS-S issue procedures do not apply. Examples include:
     reduced price items; health hazard items; forms; local manufacture items; non-stock
     listed items; and rubber stamps that require special issue procedures. Also, under certain
     circumstances, customers may request issue of unserviceable items managed on ILS-S
     unserviceable detail (R920) records. When requested, special issue procedures and
     coding are required.
     5.2.2.3. The following actions will be performed for each condition. See Special Type
     Items and Conditions in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for transaction specific input
     formats.
         5.2.2.3.1. Transient Aircraft Item Issues
            5.2.2.3.1.1. Foreign Government Aircraft. Process issues according to AFI 25-
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 89


          301, Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements.
             5.2.2.3.1.1.1. This section provides materiel management procedures for
             international cross-servicing of Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft using
             Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authority. Under ACSA,
             logistic support exchanges are voluntary and at the discretion of the
             MAJCOM and installation/unit providing or receiving support. Each request is
             considered on a case-by-case basis, evaluated for legal authority, capability to
             support, and the supporting entity’s mission impact if the request is supported.
             This section provides instructions concerning the authority to exchange
             logistics support with international partners for the purpose of recovering
             NMC aircraft.
               5.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. The ACSA program is implemented using AFI 25-301 and
               is administered by each MAJCOM, NAF or AFFOR Logistics Plans
               function, normally residing within the A4R division. ACSA should never be
               confused with Foreign Military Sales (FMS) processes and procedures
               because it is a separate and distinct authority. In its most basic form, ACSA
               is a commander’s tool to procure, provide, or exchanges logistical support in
               emergent situations, such as, providing supply assets to an eligible
               international nation or organization to recover their NMC aircraft.
               5.2.2.3.1.1.1.2. LRS/Materiel Management Activity and/or maintenance
               commanders must seek guidance on ACSA exchange approval from their
               MAJCOM, NAF, or AFFOR A4R ACSA program manager before
               supporting international support requests. The HHQ ACSA program
               manager will coordinate the approval with appropriate agencies and if
               approved, provide the supporting unit with an ACSA form and instructions
               on how to proceed.
                  5.2.2.3.1.1.1.2.1. MAJCOMs have the option to delegate ACSA
                  exchange approval authority to local commanders.
               5.2.2.3.1.1.1.3. As part of the approval process, the HHQ ACSA manager,
               in coordination with the providing unit(s) will ensure:
                  5.2.2.3.1.1.1.3.1. The requesting nation is ACSA eligible.
                  5.2.2.3.1.1.1.3.2. The asset being provided or exchanged is authorized
                  under ACSA authority.
                  5.2.2.3.1.1.1.3.3. Any negative mission impacts of providing support
                  are minimal.
               5.2.2.3.1.1.1.4. An ACSA Mutual Logistics Support (MLS) order form
               completed and authorized by the HHQ ACSA manager is required to
               proceed with providing provisions of supply assets to international partners.
             5.2.2.3.1.1.2. Materiel management guidance.
               5.2.2.3.1.1.2.1. Having gained ACSA transaction approval, one of two
               materiel management procedures is used depending on the overall
               management concept of the asset(s) provided: contracted or non-
 90                                                            AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                    contracted/organic item management.
                    5.2.2.3.1.1.2.2. Contractor Inventory Control Point (CICP) managed items.
                        5.2.2.3.1.1.2.2.1. When the asset is repairable (DIFM asset), the
                        requesting nation must agree to immediately exchange the unserviceable
                        part for the issued serviceable part.
                        5.2.2.3.1.1.2.2.2. When the above conditions are met, the most
                        appropriate maintenance organization will order the part on their supply
                        account. If the requirement is actually loaded in a maintenance system
                        with a valid job control number (JCN), requisitions will be processed in
                        the appropriate maintenance system with an activity code “J” document
                        number. If there is no maintenance system JCN, the requisition will be
                        processed directly with the LRS/Materiel Management Activity using
                        the ILS-S under an activity code “X” document number. For either
                        scenario, assets are ordered non-recurring, using the foreign aircraft tail
                        number and nation/organization being supported as the “mark-for”. The
                        last two positions of the mark-for will be the ACSA country code. An
                        example mark for would be “CC0006516ALWCA” (Tail CC00065, Unit
                        516 ALW, from Canada). In order to clear the DIFM detail, the
                        unserviceable foreign part is immediately returned to the providing
                        maintenance organization and turned in to LRS/Materiel Management
                        Activity as unserviceable.

             modification with materiel condition code D.
             5.2.2.3.2.2.2. The following actions should be considered before processing
             customer issue requests:
               5.2.2.3.2.2.2.1. Customer Actions. The customer determines if unmodified
               assets may be used, or if TCTO kits are available for modification. This
               action is performed by contacting the TCTO kit manager for review of the
               modification technical order (for applicability by end-item model number,
               completion dates, etc.) and kit availability.
               5.2.2.3.2.2.2.2. LRS/Materiel Management Activity Actions. Customer
               Support personnel processes TCTO item issue requests with materiel
               condition code D if unmodified assets may be used. The Inspection function
               works with the responsible maintenance activity for item modification if
               needed when TCTO kits are available. Customer Support works with the
               base TCTO kit manager to determine the type of LRS/Materiel Management
               Activity action required to satisfy the issue request when TCTO kits are not
               available.
       5.2.2.3.3. Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Issues. All NWRM issue
       requests will comply with AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel
       Management.
          5.2.2.3.3.1. The Customer Support/After Hours support will:
             5.2.2.3.3.1.1. Review the current NWRM authorization list to ensure the
             individual and/or organization ordering the asset is a valid recipient.
             5.2.2.3.3.1.2. Provide the NWRM Transaction Control Center (NTCC) NSN,
             part number, issue document number, quantity, unit of issue, and applicable
             serial number(s) of the assets. The NTCC will lift freeze code “N” via Freeze
             Code Update processing, and notify the requesting LRS/Materiel Management
             Activity that the freeze code has been removed.
             5.2.2.3.3.1.3. If asset is available, process the issue request with IEX D.
92                                                      AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            After successful processing, contact the NTCC to reload the freeze code “N”.
            5.2.2.3.3.1.4. If asset is not available: process the backorder, contact NTCC to
            process a requisition and reload the freeze code “N”.
     5.2.2.3.4. Continuous Length Items. When the issue request is for one continuous
     length of an item, assign requisition advice code 2N to the issue request. Customer
     Support personnel will query the ILS-S to see if the item record serviceable balance is
     equal to or greater than the input issue request quantity and process the request as
     follows:
        5.2.2.3.4.1. Sufficient Continuous Length. If the quantity on hand in the ILS-S is
        equal to or greater than the input issue quantity, Customer Support personnel will
        contact warehouse personnel to verify that the quantity required is in one
        continuous length. Customer Support personnel will process the issue transaction
        with the quantity requested.
        5.2.2.3.4.2. Insufficient Continuous Length. If the quantity on hand is less than
        requested, or not in a continuous length, process the issue transaction with TEX Z
        to bypass on-hand stock and requisition the appropriate continuous length.
     5.2.2.3.5. Contract Maintenance/In-House Repair for items in stock. Prepare and
     process the issue transaction using activity code C, demand code N, the organization
     code established for contract maintenance or the LRS/Materiel Management Activity
     organization code (as determined locally), and shop code CM.
     5.2.2.3.6. Free Issue Items.
        5.2.2.3.6.1. All customer issue requests for free issue of GSD assets must be
        approved by the LRS CC/AO before processing with TEX code D. Customer
        Support will be responsible for ensuring free issue criteria are met before approval
        is given. See AFI 23-101, Sec. 2C, Financial Management for GSD free issue
        criteria. and for the policy regarding free issue of CSAG-Supply items with TEX
        R.
        5.2.2.3.6.2. Customer Support sends the free issue output document to
        LRS/Materiel Management Activity Funds Management/SMAG Liaison for
        his/her initials on the face of the output document before physical issue of the
        property.
            5.2.2.3.6.2.1. If approval was not received prior to processing, and the SMAG
            disapproves the issue, the SMAG manager will contact the LRS/Materiel
            Management Activity to have the transaction record reversed and reprocessed
            with the appropriate funding.
        5.2.2.3.6.3. Equipment items (ERRCD codes ND(*) and NF(*) with alpha budget
        codes are considered free issue to EAID reporting customers with the exception of
        special projects and Depot Procured Equipment Maintenance (DPEM).
     5.2.2.3.7. Reduced Price Item Issues.
        5.2.2.3.7.1. All requests for reduced price item issues are at the option of the LRS
        CC/AO. If approved, the issue request transaction will be processed with TEX %

          and the applicable discount percentage (01 through 99) granted by the LRS
          CC/AO in positions 62-63. See Transaction Exception Code in AFH 23-123, Vol
          2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for more information concerning TEX % procedures. Reduced price
          requested items must contain a serviceable balance greater than zero or the issue
          request will be killed. Additionally, the base requisitioning objective for the item
          must be zero which indicates an inactive item. All reduced price issue
          transactions will be processed as non-recurring (demand code N) so demand data
          is not updated.
       5.2.2.3.7.2. Repair Cycle Item Initial Issues.
          5.2.2.3.7.3.. The requesting organization will submit complete written
          justification for initial issue of repair cycle assets to the Materiel Management
          Flight OIC or Superintendent for review and approval/disapproval. Note:
          Guidelines for submitting justification letter for budget code 8 items are in AFI
          23-101, Sec. 2C, Financial Management. See Non-Expendable Item Customer
          Issue Request (ISU) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, for processing
          procedures for initial issue of SPRAM assets.
          5.2.2.3.7.4. Send approved initial issue requirements to Customer Support for
          preparation and processing of the initial issue request. See Non-Expendable Item
          Customer Issue Request (ISU) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for
          processing instructions.
       5.2.2.3.8. Issue of Items Frozen for Inventory.
          5.2.2.3.8.1. Customer Support personnel will:
              5.2.2.3.8.1.1. Contact warehouse personnel to verify property is on-hand to
              support issue request.
                5.2.2.3.8.1.1.1. If asset is not available:
                    5.2.2.3.8.1.1.1.1. Contact customer to determine if MICAP condition
                    exists. See Para 5.2.4 if MICAP condition is determined.
                    5.2.2.3.8.1.1.1.2. If MICAP condition does not exist, hold transaction in
                    suspense file until notified that item record is unfrozen and normal in-
                    line processing can be completed.
                5.2.2.3.8.1.1.2. If asset is available:
                    5.2.2.3.8.1.1.2.1. Prepare an off-line issue document (DD Form 1348-
                    1A or equivalent) and forward it to the applicable warehouse function
                    for issue to the requesting activity. Mark the issue document to reflect
                    that the asset is frozen for inventory.
                    5.2.2.3.8.1.1.2.2. File the issue request in a suspense file until advised
                    by Inventory personnel of the method and time the manual issues will
                    be processed.
              5.2.2.3.8.1.2. Review and take action on all management notices and rejects
              output during processing.
94                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            5.2.2.3.8.1.3. Other Documents. Hold all other documents rejected as a result
            of inventory action in suspense until notified by Inventory personnel that the
            inventory is complete.
     5.2.2.3.9. Local Manufacture Item Issues. The normal procedure for requesting a
     locally manufactured item is for the requesting activity to submit the request through
     the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. However, there are situations where the
     locally manufactured item does not have to be processed through the LRS/Materiel
     Management Activity. The following paragraphs explain the procedures for both
     situations.
        5.2.2.3.9.1. Local Manufacture of Items Requiring LRS/Materiel Management
        Activity Processing.
            5.2.2.3.9.1.1. The requesting activity submits the requirement to the
            LRS/Materiel Management Activity on AF Form 2005 or DD Form 1348-6
            (with necessary drawings) for non-stock numbered items. Drawings or
            examples of the locally manufactured items need not accompany the DD
            Form 1348-6 or the AF Form 2005 when the remarks blocks contain a
            statement that the manufacturing activity currently possesses the necessary
            documents. In other words, this is not the first request for the item. Normal
            issue/stock control procedures will apply.
            5.2.2.3.9.1.2. Items Coded Field Manufacture (FM). The following actions
            are taken to request local manufacture items coded FM:
              5.2.2.3.9.1.2.1. If the locally manufactured item is beyond base
              maintenance capability to manufacture, maintenance personnel return the
              work order request with the reason for non-manufacture to the LRS/Materiel
              Management Activity. LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel will
              cancel the local manufacture due-in detail record and assign requisition
              exception code 2. See Requisition Exception Codes in AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
              Pt 1, Ch 5 for requisition exception code processing instructions.
            5.2.2.3.9.1.3. Items not coded field manufacture (FM). The following action
            is taken to request the local manufacturing of items not coded FM:
              5.2.2.3.9.1.3.1. The using activity sends the request to Customer Support.
              If the item is not stock listed, Customer Support personnel identify the
              requested item and assign an ERRCD and a locally assigned stock number.
              If the item is identified as an accountable equipment (activity code E) item,
              the request is sent to the customer for preparation of AF Form 601/AF Form
              2005 before issue processing in the ILS-S.
              5.2.2.3.9.1.3.2. For stock listed budget code 9 DLA items, contact AFMC
              SCM-R Weapons System Support Activity to process Demand History
              Adjustment transaction.
              5.2.2.3.9.1.3.3. If the request is not for an equipment item, LRS/Materiel
              Management Activity personnel processes the issue request as memo (TEX
              7) and prepares a special requisition transaction to complete requisitioning.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 95


               Additionally, they will prepare a DD Form 1348-1A (eight copies) and send
               all copies to the appropriate maintenance Production Control activity.
              5.2.2.3.9.1.4. BCE locally manufactured items. The following actions are
              performed when the BCE is tasked to locally manufacture requested items:
               5.2.2.3.9.1.4.1. The requesting organization submits the request to
               Customer Support on AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request and
               AF Form 2005 or AF Form 601 (Equipment) as applicable. Additionally,
               non-stock numbered items require a DD Form 1348-6 with all necessary
               drawings attached. If local manufacture by the BCE is appropriate,
               Customer Support Liaison establishes a memo backorder (due-out) with
               TEX 7 and processes a special requisition transaction to complete ILS-S
               processing. See Special Requisition (SPR) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol
               2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for special requisition transaction instructions.
               5.2.2.3.9.1.4.2. The requesting organization then submits the DD Form
               1348-1A and AF Form 332 to the BCE for approval of local manufacture.
               If the AF Form 332 is approved, the item is locally manufactured and
               delivered to the Cargo Movement Section with the DD Form 1348-1A.
               Normal receipt and issue processing applies.
          5.2.2.3.9.2. Local Manufacture of        Items   Not    Requiring    LRS/Materiel
          Management Activity Processing.
              5.2.2.3.9.2.1. If the item is needed to satisfy an internal maintenance
              requirement, the Maintenance Group Commander may authorize local
              manufacture of the item without processing the request through the
              LRS/Materiel Management Activity if it is coded as a field level locally
              manufactured item When this option is used, paperwork does not have to be
              processed through the LRS/Materiel Management Activity and no demand
              may be placed on the LRS/Materiel Management Activity.
              5.2.2.3.9.2.2. If the item is needed to satisfy an internal BCE maintenance
              requirement, and equipment accountability (activity code E) is not applicable,
              the LRS/Materiel Management Activity will annotate the AF Form 332 in
              Block 31 with a statement indicating the item is not available through the ILS-
              S and that no further processing through the LRS/Materiel Management
              Activity is required. The request will then be returned to the BCE.
       5.2.2.3.10. Liquid Oxygen (LOX)/Liquid Nitrogen (LIN)/Deicing Fluid Issues.
          5.2.2.3.10.1. Generating Backorders (Due-Outs) for LOX/LIN/Deicing Fluid.
          When LOX/LIN/deicing fluid stocks require replenishment, LGRF personnel
          process an issue request transaction or notify AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
          Activity of their requirements. The notification will include a minimum of:
          quantity, required delivery date (RDD), priority, and the using organization code.
          If LOX/LIN and deicing fluid products are being ordered for more than one
          organization, the quantity for each organization will be specified in the
          notification. See Transaction Exception Code in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5
          for LOX/LIN and deicing fluid issue transaction format and processing
96                                                      AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


        procedures.
        5.2.2.3.10.2. The issue will be processed with TEX 7 to establish a memo
        backorder (due-out). If only one organization consumes the product, process the
        issue transaction against the using organization code. If more than one
        organization consumes the product, process an issue transaction for each
        organization code, in proportion to historical consumption as determined by the
        LGRF.

         the Air National Guard (ANG) and AFRC units, will requisition library-type
         items directly from Base Contracting. See AFI 65-601,Vol 1 for more
         information.
         5.2.2.3.23.7. Professional Development Guide (PDG) and Specialty Knowledge
         Test (SKT) Guides. Publication distribution offices will requisition PDG and
         SKT guides to support the Weighted Airmen Promotion System (WAPS). See
         AFI 36-2605, AF Military Personnel Testing System; and AFI 36-2306.
      5.2.2.3.24. Items Assigned a Local Unit of Issue (Dash One (-1) Stock Numbers).
      Items assigned a local unit of issue are identified by a dash one (-1) in positions 14
      and 15 of the stock number. Items are normally assigned a local unit of issue when
      the basic stock number is purchased using a different unit of issue than customers
      require upon issue. For example, a basic stock number is ordered with a unit of issue
      of box (BX). However, customers only require issues of one (1) each (EA). In this
      situation, a -1 stock number would be established to allow issues of one each.
         5.2.2.3.24.1. Requisitioning dash one (-1) stock numbers. Requisition (A0*)
         transactions should not be produced for -1 stock numbers. Depot cancellation
         action will occur if a -1 stock number is requisitioned to the source of supply.
         Therefore, ensure that all replenishment requisitions are produced for the basic
         stock number only. The -1 requirement can only be filled from the on-hand
         balance of the basic stock number.
         5.2.2.3.24.2. Adjust demand data. Do not reduce the demand data on the -1 stock
         number unless a lower demand-based stock level is desired. Demand data must
         be retained to ensure a demand-based stock level is computed as required. Note:
         Demand data will be adjusted automatically when the ILS-S S01 program is
         processed.
      5.2.2.3.25. Items Under Integrated Management. Items are placed under integrated
      management to alleviate problems incurred in forecasting unusual requirements for
      individual items required to support special programs or projects. These are non-
      repetitive in nature and cannot be predicted through the use of demand history or
      available program data. Additionally, these items have the greatest probability of
      materializing and resulting in the eventual submission of requisitions. This procedure
      is applicable to AFMC Air Logistics Centers, AFMC base support activities, and AF
      base level activities who become involved in these types of programs. Compliance
      with these procedures will permit a greater degree of responsive support for planned
      projects and programs, and can improve ICP effectiveness and enhance customer
      support.
         5.2.2.3.25.1. Items under integrated management are requisitioned as follows:
             5.2.2.3.25.1.1. Process a special requisition transaction to load the due-in
             detail. Demand Code P (Special Programs – Nonrecurring) will be used on
             the special requisition transaction format.
             5.2.2.3.25.1.2. Prevent due-in cancellation. Either establish a due-out or be
             sure the special requirement indicator (SRI) R is used on the special
             requisition transaction. Note: The SRI R appears on the due-in detail. Due-
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  101


              out detail or due-in details containing SRI R will prevent the ILS-S from
              requesting cancellation on these requisitions.
       5.2.2.3.26. Lumber and Other Wood Products. Lumber and other wood products
       coded for requisitioning from the DLA Land and Maritime may be locally purchased
       if the total value of the requisition is $2,500 or less. Note: There is no set dollar
       limit on lumber and other wood products coded for local purchase. For emergency
       lumber requirements not available locally, regardless of price, are processed
       dependent upon the FSC.
       5.2.2.3.27. AF Broadcasting Service (AFBS) Items. Submit requisitions for AF
       Broadcasting Service (AFBS) items (project code SAR) to the Television-
       Audiovisual Support Activity (T-ASA), Sacramento Army Depot CA, RIC BS7.
       Submit requisitions for AFBS part-numbered items in message format using DIC
       A0E/A05. Include all information from the required DD Form 1348-6, Non-NSN
       Requisition (Manual), in the message. In addition, enter the T-ASA management
       control number (MCN), if known, in the remarks block of the message. Media and
       Status (M&S) code T will be entered in block 7 for all requisitions. This will ensure
       100 percent supply and shipping status is furnished by T-ASA. After the message is
       prepared and released, enter the requisition into the ILS-S. After the requisition is
       entered, immediately process a supply status transaction input with status code BD
       (delayed), and with an EDD of 45 days from the date of the requisition number.
       Note: Do not use A0B/A02 procedures to requisition AFBS items.
       5.2.2.3.28. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Vehicle Parts. The DLA Land and
       Maritime is an optional source for vehicle parts to Air Force vehicle management
       activities, and can supply repair parts for commercial vehicles to military activities
       within the continental United States and overseas. Bases may use DLA Land and
       Maritime as an alternate source of supply to obtain vehicle parts not available from
       local procurement. The DLA Land and Maritime provides vehicle parts to AF
       Support for both national stock number (NSN) and non-NSN items are provided. All
       vehicle part requisitions submitted to DLA Land and Maritime must have a project
       code assigned to align the requirement to the specific type of vehicle equipment
       supported. Applicable project codes are: JZO (Administrative Vehicles); JZC
       (Commercial Construction Equipment); and JZM (Materiel Handling Equipment).
          5.2.2.3.28.1. Vehicle Part Requisitioning Process. Bases submit requisitions
          directly to DLA Land and Maritime (RIC equals S9C or SMS) with the correct
          JZ(*) project code. When the requisition is received, DLA Land and Maritime
          will provide supply status BZ indicating the requisition has been forwarded for
          action. If the requisitioned item is not included on the DLA Land and Maritime
          contract, the requisition will be canceled. Excluded items include: non-price
          listed items; tires; hazardous materials (batteries, flammables, etc.); extended cost
          exceeds $10,000.00; and 463L pallets and associated equipment.
          5.2.2.3.28.2. DLA Land and Maritime Actions. Once the requisition is accepted
          by DLA Land and Maritime, supply status BM with RIC S9J or SMS is provided
          to advise that the requisition is being supported through DLA Land and Maritime.
          When the asset is shipped, supply status BV is provided.
102                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.2.3.29. Chemical Warfare Defense Equipment (CWDE). When Chemical
      Warfare Defense Equipment (CWDE) items are requisitioned, enter additional
      information on the output requisition (A0*) transaction as follows.
         5.2.2.3.29.1. DLA Requisition Data Requirements. If the source of supply is the
         DLA Troop Support, RIC S9T or SMS, the priority designator in positions 60-61
         must be 05, required delivery date (RDD) in positions 62-64 must be S24, and the
         requisition advice code in positions 65-66 must be 2L.
         5.2.2.3.29.2. AFMC Requisition Data Requirements. If the source of supply is
         AFMC Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC), RIC FLZ, the requisition must contain
         the applicable 6*-series requisition advice code.
      5.2.2.3.30. Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Service (DLADS) Items.           All
      items withdrawn from DLADS are processed in the ILS-S as free issue.
         5.2.2.3.30.1. DLADS Withdrawal Authorization. The AO provides a letter to
         DLADS identifying the individuals authorized to authenticate requisitions for
         removal of assets from DLADS. This letter will include the base DODAAC),
         long line (mailing) address, telephone number, and full name and signature of
         individuals authorized to authenticate direct removal of DLADS items on behalf
         of the AO. Note: Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) activities with their own
         DODAAC will submit appointment letters directly to the servicing DLADS.
         Property received by NAF activities from DLADS must be for administrative or
         other purposes from which no direct benefits will be realized by individuals (i.e.,
         resale).
         5.2.2.3.30.2. Withdrawing Materiel from DLADS. All property withdrawals
         from DLADS (regardless of the asset condition) must be for valid, documented
         official requirements. DLADS withdrawals are subject to the same criteria as
         requests from other DoD sources, i.e., all withdrawals must be properly accounted
         for and posted in the ILS-S. Local retail supply activities document and approve
         DLADS withdrawals for established customer or stock replenishment
         requirements. Exception: If the requested item is AFMC-managed (ERRCD
         XD2) and budget code 8, AFMC item manager approval must be obtained prior to
         physical withdrawal of the asset from DLADS. Item manager approval is
         necessary to ensure there is a valid AF requirement for the asset prior to
         withdrawal.
            5.2.2.3.30.2.1. Manual (offline) requisition log. Customer Support maintains
            an offline (manual) requisition number log to manage withdrawals from
            DLADS. At a minimum, the log contains the customer's name, organization,
            office symbol, phone number, intended use of the property, document number,
            stock number, nomenclature, quantity, and a suspense date for a copy of the
            completed paperwork to be returned to Customer Support. If the suspense
            date has passed, Customer Support contacts the customer for resolution.
            5.2.2.3.30.2.2. DLADS withdrawals for organizational requirements.
            DLADS withdrawals for organizational requirements must be for assets
            normally authorized for requesting organizations and specific customer
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                103


             requirements. For audit purposes, base activities (other than NAF activities)
             must request all property (regardless of condition) located in DLADS through
             the retail Materiel Management Activity. The retail Materiel Management
             Activity ensures the requester is an authorized representative of the requesting
             organizational activity. Authorization for organizational DLADS withdrawal
             may be accomplished using any local approval procedure. For example,
             authorization letters from the unit commander, alpha rosters, or simply
             checking for valid identification may suffice. With few exceptions,
             organizational requests to withdraw property from DLADS must be
             established in the ILS-S to support valid customer requirements (due-out) and
             create audit trails for each DLADS withdrawal.
              5.2.2.3.30.2.2.1. Establishing customer due-out. Items pending withdrawal
              from DLADS must be assigned a valid stock number in order to process the
              requirement through the retail Materiel Management Activity. Therefore,
              Customer Support will have a new item record load (FIL) transaction
              processed (if required). If DLADS has a locally-assigned stock number
              (non- NSN) identifying the item, a new FIL transaction is required to load
              the new stock number using an L-serialized number. Place the DLADS
              local number (from the DLADS screening sheet) and a short description of
              the item in the nomenclature field of the item record load. Once the item
              record is loaded, an issue transaction is processed in the ILS-S with TEX
              code H and the appropriate Demand Code (recurring vs. non-recurring).
              The issue transaction creates a memo due-out detail to the customer's
              organization. Note: This customer due-out detail may be established before
              or after customer visits the DLADS; however, normal due-in-from-
              maintenance (DIFM) controls and demand data update requirements apply.
              If an item in DLADS contains ERRCD XD* or XF* (regardless of
              serviceability), it is placed under DIFM control unless the item will not be
              repaired or used for its original purpose. Items that will not be repaired or
              used for their original purpose may be processed, bypassing DIFM control,
              by using demand code I, J, K, L, or M, as appropriate.
              5.2.2.3.30.2.2.2. Requisitioning procedures. When property required to fill
              the due-out requirement is available in DLADS, Customer Support
              processes a special requisition transaction with RIC JBR in positions 4-6,
              and J, K, or L in position 40, the supplying activity DODAAC in positions
              45-50, and the due-out document number in positions 67-80. The JBR
              routing identifier code ensures property is released to the customer at no
              cost.
             5.2.2.3.30.2.3. DLADS withdrawals for stock replenishment requirements.
             LRS/Materiel Management Activities may withdraw serviceable items from
             DLADS to fill stock replenishment requirements. In this situation, a customer
             due-out detail is not required. The special requisition transaction is processed
             with positions 67-80 blank.
             5.2.2.3.30.2.4. DLADS Withdrawal of Accountable Equipment Items. Refer
             to Para 5.4.11
104                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            5.2.2.3.30.2.5. DLADS withdrawal of scrap materiel. If property identified
            as scrap is located in DLADS, automated DLADS withdrawal processing is
            not required. Customer Support Liaison personnel prepare DD Form 1348-1A
            requisition document using an offline requisition number. Place the word
            SCRAP in the stock number field. Mark the document “DO NOT POST,”
            and ensure the customer returns a DLADS signed copy of the completed
            document to Customer Support.
            5.2.2.3.30.2.6. DLADS withdrawal of material in batch lots. If DLADS has
            the required item in a batch lot, it is usually not necessary for the customer to
            withdraw the complete lot to obtain the needed item. If part of the batch lot is
            withdrawn, follow DLADS withdrawal procedures for individual item
            withdrawal. If the customer wants the entire lot, the DD Form 1348-1A
            requisition document must be processed as DO NOT POST. Customer
            Support Liaison personnel annotate the lot number in the stock number field
            on the DD Form 1348-1A document rather than identifying individual items
            by stock number. However, after withdrawal, the customer will return the
            entire batch lot to the retail Materiel Management Activity Inspection
            function for item identification and establishment of stock number records. If
            an item record is not loaded for an item included in a batch lot, a new item
            record load transaction is required to load the item in the ILS-S.
            5.2.2.3.30.2.7. DLADS withdrawal requests for materiel managed by other
            type accounts. Requests for withdrawal of DLADS materials normally
            managed by other accounts, e.g., medical items in FSG 65, will not be
            processed through the ILS-S. Advise the customer to request the item through
            the appropriate submission source.
         5.2.2.3.30.3. Organizations Geographically Separated From DLADS. When the
         retail Materiel Management Activity and requesting activity/organization are
         geographically separated from the DLADS, the AO may issue a block of DD
         Form 1348-1A requisition document numbers (with the stock number blank), to
         geographically separated units. This is intended to preclude multiple trips
         between the DLADS and the LRS/Materiel Management Activity and must be
         monitored carefully. LRS/Materiel Management Activity prepares the DD Form
         1348-1A, leaving the stock number and nomenclature blank. The Materiel
         Management Officer furnishes instructions for the customer on what data are to
         be added after identifying the item selected.
            5.2.2.3.30.3.1. Suspense log. Customer Support Liaison establishes a
            suspense log to reflect requisition document numbers assigned on all DLADS
            withdrawals for geographically separated units. The log reflects the number
            of withdrawals, signature of recipient, category of property, due date for
            return of unused documents or copy of used documents, and any other
            pertinent data.
      5.2.2.3.31. Sole Source/Brand Name Items. AF policy allows customers to request
      specific “Brand-Name” items without Base Contracting competing the requirement
      with local vendors. Additionally, customers may be authorized (with certain
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               105


       limitations) to request a specific vendor or one “Sole Source” for items. To comply
       with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requirements, the customer must provide
       a technical justification to Contracting for each Sole Source or Brand-Name request.
       The customer must also prepare and provide any technical requirements to support
       the justification. DD Form 1348-6, Non-NSN Requisition, will be prepared to
       provide Contracting a complete description of the required item. Note: To ensure
       prompt processing, Customer justification statements may be expanded (as necessary)
       to ensure Contracting requirements are satisfied.
          5.2.2.3.31.1. Brand-Name Requirements. If a customer specifies that only one
          manufacturer’s part number or specific item will satisfy requirements, Brand-
          Name requisitioning may be justified. The customer must also specify in writing
          what technical requirements exist to justify use of a brand-name item, rather than
          procure the item competitively. A DD Form 1348-6 must also be prepared
          describing the required item. The DD Form 1348-6 must also include the
          statement “DO NOT SUBSTITUTE”. Note: Brand-Name requisitioning does
          not necessarily justify sole source procurement.
          5.2.2.3.31.2. Sole-Source Requirements. If a customer specifies that only one
          vendor or Sole Source can supply the requested item (or suitable substitute), Sole
          Source requisitioning may be justified. The customer must specify in writing why
          the requirement can only be satisfied from one source. A DD Form 1348-6 must
          also be prepared describing the required item. The justification and DD Form
          1348-6 will be forwarded to Research for checking against available commercial
          catalogs and federal supply schedules, to determine if the requested item can be
          procured from other sources within the date required. Research will annotate any
          other potential sources on the DD Form 1348-6.
          5.2.2.3.31.3. Recycled Products. AF policy requires the use of recycled products
          when available and practical. Customers are responsible for using recycled
          products, except when recycled products do not meet minimum quality standards
          for the intended use. When recycled products cannot be used for Brand Name or
          Sole Source requirements, customers must include in the justification letter the
          technical or mission requirements which preclude the use of recycled materials.
          5.2.2.3.31.4. Brand Name/Sole Source Request Processing. A customer due-out
          will be established in the ILS-S for each Brand Name or Sole Source Request
          with demand code N (nonrecurring). This will ensure the ILS-S will not compute
          a demand-based stock level and stock the requested items. Note: If a customer
          requires a Brand Name or Sole Source item more than once, and there is no
          suitable substitute available, have an AF Form 86 prepared to have the item
          cataloged. See Request For Stock List Data: Data For Input #1 And Input #2
          (BZA) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information concerning AF
          Form 86 processing.
       5.2.2.3.32. Base Investment (Budget Code Z) Items.       The ILS-S will not
       automatically requisition base investment (budget code Z) items. Equipment
       Management establishes a memo due-out (TEX 7) for each Budget Code Z customer
       request. Once the memo customer due-out is entered into the ILS-S, a 350
106                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      management notice (Requisition Suppressed) is produced.         See General
      Use/Reject/Management Notices in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more
      information concerning processing of the 350 management notice.
         5.2.2.3.32.1. Funds Availability.    Equipment Management sends the 350
         management notice to the Customer Support to check the availability of base
         investment funds. If funds are not immediately available for the requested item,
         the customer due-out detail will remain memo. As long as the requirement
         remains unfunded, the LRS/Materiel Management Activity Funds Manager or
         Customer Support will retain the 350 management notice in suspense in a locally
         determined sequence or they can utilize a local computer listing to sort all budget
         code Z requests according to their buy priority. The Customer Support will
         establish jacket files and coordinate with Base Budget on all budget code Z
         requirements.
         5.2.2.3.32.2. Determining Buy Priority. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity
         Resource Management activity or Customer Support Liaison will use the 350
         management notice or local listing/file to manage all budget code Z item requests
         according to their buy priority. The buy priority depends on the customer's
         urgency of need (UND) and impact statements. The Financial Management
         Board (FMB) will determine the buy priority. The LRS/Materiel Management
         Activity Funds Manager/Customer Support or Base Budget personnel will send
         the priority list of budget code Z requirements to base Accounting and Finance
         budget personnel for submission to the applicable MAJCOM to get funding
         approval as required. After receiving MAJCOM approval for base investment
         item requests, the LRS/Materiel Management Activity Funds Manager or
         Customer Support will annotate the approved 350 management notice from the
         suspense file indicating funds are available, and initiate special requisitioning
         processing. The LRS will coordinate with AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity
         on any non-local purchase budget code Z requirements when funding is received
         to ensure the requirements are requisitioned.
         5.2.2.3.32.3. Customer Support will use the following instructions to prepare the
         special requisition transaction:
            5.2.2.3.32.3.1. Fund code assignment.       AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
            Activity will assign the fund code for budget code Z requisitions based upon
            appropriations:
              5.2.2.3.32.3.1.1. Appropriation 57*3080--assign fund code 17.
              5.2.2.3.32.3.1.2. Appropriation 57*3600--assign fund code 29.
              5.2.2.3.32.3.1.3. Appropriation 97*0300 4802--assign fund code 8C.
         5.2.2.3.32.4. Industrial Fund Activity Budget Code Z Item Requisitions. Special
         requisitions for investment equipment for industrial fund activities will place the
         appropriate fiscal year code in position 51, the industrial fund code in positions
         52-53, and requisition advice code 2E in positions 65-66.
         5.2.2.3.32.5. AF    Materiel   Command       (AFMC)     and    General    Services
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               107


          Administration (GSA) Items.
             5.2.2.3.32.5.1. Requisition Preparation. Enter a certification that funds are
             available for the fund code cited on the manual requisition form or an attached
             sheet/letter signed by the certifying Financial Services Office (FSO)
             individual. For overseas bases, you must enter a funds limitation statement,
             MAXIMUM FUNDS AUTHORIZED $XXXXX.00, in the lower right-hand
             corner of the requisition. If the maximum dollar amount of funds listed is too
             low to procure the item, the supply source will cancel the requisition. If the
             supply source cancels the requisition, Records Maintenance will calculate a
             new standard price and process a unit price change (FCU) transaction. AFMC
             SCM-R Stock Control Activity will then submit a new requisition with a new
             price.
             5.2.2.3.32.5.2. Prepare a special requisition IAW Para 5.2.5.3 Enter the
             fiscal year code in position 51 rather than the signal code. This action will
             ensure investment funds are obligated to the correct activity. Note: For
             overseas bases only, assign the applicable fund code in positions 52-53 based
             upon the appropriation.
          5.2.2.3.32.6. Interim Processing by the Customer Support. When the Funds
          Manager or Customer Support receives the completed requisition and approved
          350 management notices, the 350 management notice will be annotated with the
          current date and all documents will be sent to FSO. A copy of the 350
          management notice and all supporting documentation will be filed as locally
          determined.
          5.2.2.3.32.7. Financial Services Office (FSO) Processing. FSO will perform the
          following actions after receiving the pending requisition:
             5.2.2.3.32.7.1. Certify funds are available.
             5.2.2.3.32.7.2. Assign the applicable appropriation (budget program or
             program line number).
             5.2.2.3.32.7.3. Retain a file copy of all supporting documentation.
             5.2.2.3.32.7.4. Load funds (annual budget authorization (ABA) and
             allotment) to the budget code Z MACR.
             5.2.2.3.32.7.5. Notify the LRS Resource Management Activity or Customer
             Support Liaison that the requirement was funded and return all supporting
             documentation.
          5.2.2.3.32.8. Final Processing by the LRS Resource Management Activity or
          Customer Support Liaison . After receiving funding notification from FSO, the
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity Funds Manager or Customer Support will
          destroy the suspense copy of the approved 350 management notice. The
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity Funds Manager or Customer Support Liaison
          will request AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity to process the SPR transaction
          to establish a due-in detail, firm-up the customer due-out detail (if applicable),
          and update the budget code Z MACR.
108                                                      AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.2.3.33. Exchange of AF Property with Commercial Sources.               Whenever
      economically possible and efficient, AF policy allows the exchange of property with
      commercial sources to satisfy requirements. The exchanged item and the procured
      item must be similar, the procured item replaces and performs substantially all of the
      functions of the exchange item. If required, the exchange property has been made
      safe or harmless, or has been demilitarized. Lastly, the exchanged and procured items
      are eligible to be exchanged per Property Eligible For Exchange in AFH 23-123, Vol
      2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Note: A list of Property Ineligible For Exchange is provided in the
      same reference. To request a waiver of exchange requirements, a customer must
      submit a fully justified request to AF/A4LM. If approved, AF/A4LM will send the
      waiver request to GSA for action.
         5.2.2.3.33.1. Recording of the Exchange. The item being procured must be
         recorded and issued at the Latest Acquisition Cost. Customers must submit a
         letter requesting an exchange of any item not specifically excluded from the
         program. The letter will contain the following statement: this property is offered
         as exchange or trade-in under the exchange provisions of the Federal Property and
         Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, DoD Materiel Management
         Regulation (DoD 4140.1-R), 23 May 2003, Category Applies. Note: Enter the
         numeric category from Property Eligible For Exchange in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
         1, Ch 5.
         5.2.2.3.33.2. Customer Support Liaison/Equipment Management Actions.
         Depending on the commodity exchanged (supplies/equipment), Customer Support
         Liaison or Equipment Management personnel will send AFMC SCM-R Stock
         Control Activity three copies of the exchange request letter and a copy of the
         management notice showing the due-out and requisition document numbers.
         5.2.2.3.33.3. Customer Support Liaison Actions. Customer Support Liaison
         personnel will record the requisition and due-out document numbers on all copies
         of the exchange request letter. Customer Support Liaison will send one copy to
         Contracting and file one copy in requisition number sequence. Customer Support
         will work with BCO to ensure the item is eligible for exchange, the LAC is
         assigned, and the amount of credit to be received for the exchange item is
         determined. Customer Support must record the new item LAC and amount of
         credit on their copy of the request letter.
             5.2.2.3.33.3.1. Notify Receiving. Customer Support will send Receiving a
             copy of the exchange request letter with applicable cost information.
             Additionally, Customer Support will include a note directing Receiving to
             process a receipt transaction for the exchanged item.
             5.2.2.3.33.3.2. Verify Receipt or Cancellation. After receipt processing,
             Customer Support will retain the exchange request letter for one year.
             Customer Support will verify that the customer has received the property or
             the due-out has been satisfied. If the item has not been received, or is still
             due-out, contact Contracting to obtain current status for the exchange item.
             Customer Support will record the date of the review on the letter and file it for
             another year.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    109


                5.2.2.3.33.3.3. Processing Exchange Requisitions. Customer Support will
                process exchange requisitions in the ILS-S. Contracting will provide
                procurement status containing Quantity Purchased Variance Code T in the
                local purchase status (LPS) or local purchase adjustments (LPA) transactions.
                When Customer Support processes the LPS/LPA transactions with Quantity
                Purchased Variance Code T, the ILS-S will update the price on the local
                purchase status detail. Note: The ILS-S will not change the unit price on the
                item record.
            5.2.2.3.33.4. Return Processing for Exchangeable Items. When the new item
            arrives, the customer will return the item to be exchanged to LRS/Materiel
            Management Activity. Note: Some items may require inspection. If the
            contractor or vendor wants to inspect the exchangeable item, refer the inspection
            request to Contracting. Customer Support Liaison/FSC will process return
            transactions using the instructions in Sec. 6B, Returns with TEX 8 or 1, and
            activity code E, P, or R, as applicable.
            5.2.2.3.33.5. USAF Historical Property Issues. All USAF historical property
            issue requests will comply with AFI 84-103, USAF Heritage Program.
  5.2.3. Issue to Supply Point, MSK, WRM, RSP, and Non-Airborne RSP Detail Records.
     5.2.3.1. Purpose: To explain how to process issues to supply point, MSK, WRM, RSP,
     and Non-Airborne RSP detail records. For policy specific requirements, review AFI 23-
     101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.2.3.2. General Discussion: The ILS-S reformats the issue from detail record input
     transaction into a replenishment issue to detail record transaction during issue from detail
     processing. This process can only be bypassed by assigning a TEX “F” when processing
     the issue from detail record. When automatic replenishment transactions are bypassed or
     other circumstances dictate, an issue must be processed to these detail records to
     replenish the details. The ILS-S will only issue the input quantity up to the authorized
     level or backorder any unfilled quantity as appropriate under normal processing.
     5.2.3.3. The following actions will be taken when processing:
        5.2.3.3.1. Process replenishment issues to Supply Point detail records with:
            5.2.3.3.1.1. Activity code S, organization code 005, and applicable supply point
            code in the document number. Use demand code N in order to bypass demand
            data update.
            5.2.3.3.1.2. TEX 6 or 4 when processing issue request for recapped tires assigned
            the dash two (-2) stock number.
            5.2.3.3.1.3. TEX 2, K, 6, and 4 or V when the replenishment issue is for a
            recapped tire and a requirement exists to exceed the authorized Supply Point
            authorized quantity.
        5.2.3.3.1.4. TEX M to bypass kill action and establish a backorder for the requested
        item when substitute items are available with equal units of issue, but the assets
        cannot be used.

               (or part of the input quantity) and permit issue and/or due-out action resulting in
               excess detail assets.
                   5.2.3.3.3.1.1. If TEX 7 or P is used, a special requisition submission
                   transaction will be required. See Special Requisition (SPR) Transaction in

                in the maintenance repair cycle (DIFM).
            5.2.4.3.1.2. Cannibalization of serviceable items from another unserviceable end-
            item will be considered if assets are not available for issue.
        5.2.4.3.2. Once all base stocks have been exhausted , establish the MICAP
        backorder:
            5.2.4.3.2.1. The following paragraphs provide procedures for different situations:
        5.2.4.3.3. Standard MICAP:
            5.2.4.3.3.1. Aircraft MICAP request will be reprocessed with TEX 7 unless the
            SCM-R MICAP Support Activity or Weapon System Support Activity notifies
            LRS/Materiel Management Activity that the ILS-S auto sourcing logic is to be

         contacting the respective DLA Customer Interaction Center (CIC) for all DLA
         managed requirements.
           5.2.4.3.4.3.2.1. If assets are available, AFMC SCM-R Weapon System
           Support Activity will call the requirement in to the appropriate DLA CIC.
           5.2.4.3.4.3.2.2. If no assets are available, AFMC SCM-R Weapon System
           Support Activity will check the (National Logistics Support Center Website:
           www.cls.nlsc.noaa.gov) for asset availability.
               5.2.4.3.4.3.2.2.1. If assets are available at G13, AFMC SCM-R Weapon
               System Support Activity will contact DLA CIC and inform the
               representative assets are available at G13 and they should process "BM"
               status to pass the requirement to G13 manual NEXRAD MICAP
               support:
         5.2.4.3.4.3.3. AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity will assign an
         off-line requisition number.
         5.2.4.3.4.3.4. For National Weather Service (NWS) managed reparable,
         MICAP requirements must be processed in-line with the MICAP controller
         ensuring that the correct supplementary address is entered. The requisition
         should go directly to AFMC Air Logistics Complex (Ogden/FGZ) for
         processing. If the requisition is not in the DO35A system the MICAP
         Controller will enter the requisition information into DO35A.
         5.2.4.3.4.3.5. For consumable items, the MICAP controller will check for
         asset availability at the respective DLA CIC (SMS). If assets are available, the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  113


              MICAP controller will call the requirement into the appropriate DLA CIC.
              The MICAP controller must ensure the correct supplementary address is given
              and inform the CIC representative the requirement is for a NEXRAD
              emergency. If no assets are available, the MICAP controller will check the
              NWS website for asset availability. If assets are available at G13, the MICAP
              controller will contact DLA CIC with offline requisition information and
              inform the DLA CIC customer service representative assets are available at
              G13 and to process "BM" status to transfer the requisition to G13.
              5.2.4.3.4.3.6. When the IT system is back in-line, the AFMC SCM-R MICAP
              Support Activity will process a special requisition transaction to load the
              requisition number.
       5.2.4.3.5. Local Manufacture (RIC:JBD) Items MICAP:
          5.2.4.3.5.1. Complete previously addressed MICAP validation process.
              5.2.4.3.5.1.1. Check availability of end-item and all bits and pieces needed to
              manufacture the item.
          5.2.4.3.5.2. Parts Available. Reprocess the issue request for the end-item using
          the appropriate MICAP UJC, when the bits and pieces required to manufacture
          the item locally are available.
          5.2.4.3.5.3. Parts Not Available. Reprocess both the killed end-item and the bits
          and pieces required for manufacture with the appropriate MICAP UJC if the bits
          and pieces required to manufacture the item locally are not available.
       5.2.4.3.6. Transient Aircraft MICAP Support.
          5.2.4.3.6.1. If a maintenance team is dispatched to repair a transient aircraft at a
          location with an AF SRAN, establish a due-out at the transient location IAW
          procedures described in Para 5.2.4.3.3
          5.2.4.3.6.2. Transient Locations without Supply Accounts.
              5.2.4.3.6.2.1. If assets are available from Aircraft’s Home Base. If assets to
              satisfy MICAP conditions for a transient aircraft are required at a location that
              does not contain an Air Force SRAN, issue the required assets at the home
              base to the home base maintenance activity. Note: Maintenance personnel
              will either dispatch a home base maintenance team or process maintenance-to-
              maintenance shipment procedures to ship the assets to the activity that will
              repair the aircraft. Home station maintenance personnel and aircraft
              commander will ensure that reparable (unserviceable) assets are returned to
              home station either with the aircraft or through transportation channels (using
              DD Form 1348-1) to clear any DIFM detail records. Assign DIFM status code
              Aircraft Cross Country (AXC) to the DIFM detail to indicate the asset is at a
              transient location.
              5.2.4.3.6.2.2. If assets are not available from Aircraft’s Home Base. If assets
              to satisfy MICAP conditions for a transient aircraft (non-home station) are
              required at a location where no Air Force SRAN exists and a home base
              maintenance team will not be dispatched, the home station will process a
114                                                  AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         MICAP due-out using the home station maintenance organizational account.
         The AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity will source for assets to
         fill the MICAP requirement. Once lateral assets are found, the AFMC SCM-R
         Weapon System Support Activity will create a manual lateral shipment
         document using the address of the recovery location. The shipment documents
         will authorize shipment of the required assets to the aircraft commander where
         the aircraft is located. The home station of the transient aircraft will become
         accountable for the shipped assets. The manual shipment documents (DD
         Form 1348-1) will contain instructions in the remarks block advising the
         aircraft commander: 1) the reparable items should be returned to the home
         station of the aircraft; and 2) the aircraft commander should contact home
         base maintenance to pick-up the reparable items. The AFMC SCM-R Weapon
         System support Activity will process the manual shipment in the applicable
         ILS-S to the home station supply account.
         5.2.4.3.6.2.3. Transfer of Asset Accountability.            To transfer asset
         accountability, the home station LRS/Materiel Management Activity will
         process a receipt transaction once notified by the AFMC SCM-R Weapon
         System Support Activity that the asset was delivered to the recovery location.
         The home station maintenance activity will advise the LRS/Materiel
         Management Activity to update the DIFM status to “AXC” to indicate the
         asset is at a transient location. The Materiel Management Flight or equivalent
         at the shipping base will also email/FAX a set of all shipping documents to the
         home station of the aircraft to the Asset Management Section. The due-out
         release and shipping documents will be cross-referenced in the ILS-S. Two
         copies of each issue document and one copy of the receiving document will be
         forwarded to base maintenance Production Control pending return of the
         aircraft. Production Control will ensure reparable items are picked up when
         the aircraft returns and the items are processed through base maintenance
         using normal DIFM procedures.
      5.2.4.3.6.3. Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Air Force Special Operations
      Command (AFSOC) Transient Aircraft. For AMC aircraft, the theater AMC
      Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) will help the LRS CC/AO locate assets for
      lateral shipments to satisfy MICAP requirements. For AFSOC aircraft, the
      AFSOC Combat Logistics Office (CLO) will assist to locate assets for lateral
      shipment to satisfy the MICAP requirements. Information requisition data (stock
      number, unit of issue, quantity, part number, technical order, figure and index)
      will be furnished to the AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity, who
      will provide -- an offline requisition number to the TACC/CLO. Item indicative
      data such as nomenclature, part number, technical order reference, and complete
      aircraft identification will also be provided. The applicable TACC/CLO will
      conduct theater lateral support searches to satisfy transient aircraft MICAP
      requirements.
      5.2.4.3.6.4. No Available Lateral Assets. If the item is not available from theater
      resources, the TACC/CLO may pursue CANN options, or the AFMC SCM-R
      Weapon System Support Activity will generate an off-line requisition to the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     115


            source of supply.
  5.2.5. Requisition Submission.
     5.2.5.1. Purpose: To explain requisitioning procedures for establishing base-generated
     requisitions. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific use
     AFH 23-123.
     5.2.5.2. General Discussion: Under normal processing, the ILS-S will generate automatic
     requisitioning actions to the source of supply. General ILS-S automated (inline)
     actions/processes are found in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, Requisition Submission.
     When circumstances prevent automatic requisitioning, an off-line requisition must be
     submitted.
     5.2.5.3. The following actions will be performed for manual (off-line) requisitioning:
         5.2.5.3.1. Lateral support requisition submission.
            5.2.5.3.1.1. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control or Weapon System Support Activities
            will process all non-MICAP lateral support requests.
            5.2.5.3.1.2. The AFMC SCM-R will request lateral support to and from NATO
            forces utilizing the Acquisition and Cross Serving Agreement through project
            officer at HQ USAFE/A4RI.
            5.2.5.3.1.3. AFMC SCM-R may telephone lateral support                    requisition
            requirements to other AF bases using the following instructions:
                5.2.5.3.1.3.1. Provide the lateral support base with an offline requisition
                number. See Requisition Serial Number Assignment in AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
                Pt 1, Ch 5 for more information about assigning offline requisition serial
                numbers.
                5.2.5.3.1.3.2. Prepare a special requisition transaction to load the requisition
                and corresponding due-in details. Input the same offline requisition number
                given to the lateral support base to ship the item(s). Note: To link the lateral
                due-in with the customer due-out, enter the customer due-out document
                number in positions 67-80 of the SPR transaction. See SPR transaction in
                AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for more information concerning special
                requisition input processing.

         purchase/local manufacture requisitions. See Sec. 3B, Local Purchase and Retail
         Sales, for additional information on establishing Local Purchase requests.
      5.2.5.3.4. Purchasing centrally managed XB/XF items related to weapon systems
      with Government Purchase Card (GPC). Specific procedures for processing GPC
      purchases are outlined in AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card
      (GPC) Program. For GPC purchases in support of vehicle maintenance requirements
      also refer to AFI 24-302.
         5.2.5.3.4.1. Obtain local purchase authority.
             5.2.5.3.4.1.1. The AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity will
             request local purchase authority and a qualified source from the applicable
             Weapon System’s Program Director (SPD) for all MICAP requirements.
             5.2.5.3.4.1.2. The AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity will
             advise the requesting activity of the approval for local purchase and provide
             the requesting activity with the qualified source information. Note: The
             decision to purchase the asset with the GPC rests with the requesting activity.
         5.2.5.3.4.2. For non-MICAP requirements, the requesting activity will be
         responsible for obtaining SPD approval for GPC purchase.
         5.2.5.3.4.3. Requesting activities will coordinate with LRS/Materiel Management
         Activity to process Due Out Cancellation, TEX 9
         5.2.5.3.4.4. AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity will process a
         monthly script to extract all TEX Code “9” Due Out Cancellations. and process a
         Demand History Adjustment in the applicable DLA Materiel Management IT
         System to capture demand data for the quantity of DLA items procured through
         local purchase for all DLA managed budget code 9 assets (for both MICAP and
         non MICAP requirements).
      5.2.5.3.5. Items requiring special requisitioning procedures. See Special Requisition
      (SPR) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for processing instructions
      required to create and submit requisition transactions for special types of items or
      conditions.
         5.2.5.3.5.1. AMC FSL Requisition Built-Up Items. AFMC SCM-R assigns
         command stock numbers to selected assemblies requiring build-up, assembly,
         cure dating, etc. Requisitions for command stock number items do not require DD
         Form 1348-6, non-NSN requisition (manual).
         5.2.5.3.5.2. Built-up items with a command stock number assigned will be
         processed in-line.
         5.2.5.3.5.3. AMC FSLs will submit telephone, fax or email requisitions to the
         AFMC SCM-R Stock Control or Weapon System Support Activity for built-up up
         items that do not have a command stock number assigned (i.e., wheels and tires).
      5.2.5.3.6. Special Requirements Indicator (SRI). Special requirements indicator
      (SRI) R is used on special requisition transactions to requisition items that the ILS-S
      will not requisition automatically.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     117


              5.2.5.3.6.1. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will forward SRI R
              justification letters to the AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity
              5.2.5.3.6.2. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will forward budget code 9
              requests to AFMC SCM-R Stock Fund Activity for funds approval. If approved,
              the AFMC SCM-R Stock Fund Activity returns the request to the AFMC SCM-R
              Stock Control Activity for processing.   See AFI 23-101 for additional
              information.
              5.2.5.3.6.3. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will use the instructions
              contained in see in Special Requirements Indicator (SRI) R in AFH 23-123, Vol
              2, Pt 1, Ch 5 to assign SRI R requisitions.
                 5.2.5.3.6.3.1. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will verify special
                 requirements indicator R monthly to ensure the special requirement condition
                 is still valid. If special requirement no longer exists, process a due-in/due-out
                 modifier transaction to remove SRI R from the ILS-S due-in detail. See
                 Requisition Modifications in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for more
                 information on due-in/due-out modifier transaction processing and requisition
                 modification. Once SRI R is removed from the due-in detail, the ILS-S
                 determines if the requisition quantity is still required or should be canceled.
                 5.2.5.3.6.3.2. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will maintain a file of
                 approved letters of justification for SRI R for each monthly validation as long
                 as the requirement is valid. Justification letters may be destroyed after the
                 requisitioned items have been received, canceled, or the requirement no longer
                 applies. Letters of justification are not required for AMC FOSE, excess
                 shipments from a deployed contingency or contracted ICPs or local routing
                 identifier requisitioning.
              5.2.5.3.6.4. AMC FSLs use SRI R to prevent production of cancellation when
              returning excess stock back to the PSP. SRI R letters of justification are not
              required for FSLs, excess shipments from deployed contingency and contracted
              ICPs. Note: If approval is required for a GSD stock fund (budget code 9) item,
              the Funds Manager must review the requisition prior to processing and identify
              any possible negative effect to the GSD stock fund operating program.
          5.2.5.3.7. REX Codes. REX codes are a one-position, alpha/numeric code assigned
          to stock numbers to restrict or modify output requisition transactions. Numeric REX
          codes are normally assigned as described in Requisition Exception (REX) Codes,
          AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Alpha REX codes are locally, AFMC SCM-R, or
          MAJCOM assigned and used to modify requisitions. See the reference above for a
          complete list of REX codes and processing instructions for each.
5.2.5.3.7.1. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity function responsible for monitoring each
REX code must prepare and maintain an exception control (ECC) image for each item IAW
AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8, Exception Phrase Load, Change, or Delete (FXR). REX codes
may be manually loaded, changed, or deleted with a stock control data (FCD) transaction. See
Procedures for Stock Control Data – Load/Change/Delete Input (FCD) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
1, Ch 2 for format and processing instructions for FCD transactions.
118                                                   AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.5.3.7.2. Suppress Automatic Requisitioning. Requisition exception codes 1, 3,
      and 4 will cause the ILS-S to suppress requisition transactions, regardless of the
      assigned exception notice code (ENC). However, requisitions are suppressed for
      all REX-coded items if ENC R (Reject) is assigned. REX codes are also used to
      identify requisitions which require external management review before
      submission. Assignment of ENC P (Process) to the REX exception phrase record
      will cause the ILS-S to enter the REX code in position 71 of the output requisition
      transaction.
         5.2.5.3.7.2.1. Before submitting the output requisition transaction to the
         supply source, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must blank position 71.
         Note: This does not apply to local purchase requisition transactions printed on
         DD Form 1348-1A.
      5.2.5.3.7.3. Requisition Override Records. Requisition exception (REX) codes
      may also be used to force the ILS-S to override normal requisition data as
      specified by the exception phrase record. Requisition exception phrase records
      loaded for this purpose are identified as requisition override records. Any alpha
      requisition exception code may be used as a requisition override record. Properly
      established requisition override records will improve local requisitioning and
      reduce the need for manual (offline) requisitions. Conversely, improper
      requisition override records will generate invalid requisitions and internal records.
      Use exception notice code (ENC) P (process) when you create requisition
      override records.
         5.2.5.3.7.3.1. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will manage the
         requisition override program.
         5.2.5.3.7.3.2. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will review and take
         action on stock numbers assigned REX codes listed in the Requisition
         Exception Code (REX) table in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 on an as
         required basis. "As required" is determined by a customer requirement or
         automated releveling processes. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will
         annually audit REX 4s ensuring there is complete processing data in the
         nomenclature field. Note: IEX "D"s will also receive annual audits.
         Additionally, REX codes will be deleted as necessary, e.g., if a part-numbered
         or non-NSN item changes to an active (cataloged) stock number, the routing
         identifier code (RIC) changes to a new source of supply that will support base
         requirements, the exception no longer applies to the item, etc.
         5.2.5.3.7.3.3. AMC FSL will coordinate assignment of requisition override
         records with AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity. The FSL will assign the
         designated REX code to all item records in the FSL satellite account based on
         the requirement. This will ensure requisitions are correctly routed. Note: Do
         not use ENC R (reject) because the ILS-S will reject the requisition
         transaction. For each requisition override record, create an ECC image that
         supports the assigned requisition override. See Exception Codes and
         Exception Code Control (ECC) Management in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch
         8 for more information concerning creating and maintaining ECC images.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 119


        5.2.5.3.8. Fund Requirement (FRC) File:
            5.2.5.3.8.1. The AFMC SCM-R Activity manages the FRC program. The AFMC
            SCM-R Activity will process the R04/NGV857, FRC Update/Analysis to identify
            instances that the ILS-S has suppressed requisitioning for a General Support
            Division (GSD) stock fund (budget code 9) item because either the Maximum
            Automatic Obligation (MAO) authority is exceeded, or the requisition does not
            pass urgency of need funding flag (UNFF) or specific stockage priority code
            (SPC) edits. See Fund Requirement (FRC) File and Image Processing in AFH 23-
            123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for FRC File and Image Processing instructions.
                5.2.5.3.8.1.1. LRS/Materiel Management Activity will process the Funds
                Requirement Update/Analysis, Option 3 as required to determine which due-
                outs to obligate. Budget code 9 items must be approved through AFMC SCM-
                R Activity.
                5.2.5.3.8.1.2. Review Due-outs assigned JBx
                5.2.5.3.8.1.3. Coordinate with organization to ensure customers are aware of
                suppressed requirements.
                5.2.5.3.8.1.4. Coordinate with AFMC SCM-R to obligate requirements.
  5.2.6. Due-Out Release (DOR).
     5.2.6.1. Purpose: To explain the DOR procedures process. For policy specific
     requirements, review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.2.6.2. General Discussion: Normally, the ILS-S automatically releases serviceable
     assets to fill a customer backorder. Special circumstances may prevent automatic release,
     and automatic release of high priority items can be manually prevented. These result in
     an on-hand balance for an item with due-outs loaded. When this occurs, the serviceable
     assets available have to be manually (forced) due-out released to fill the backorder.
     5.2.6.3. The following actions will be performed:
        5.2.6.3.1. To force release to a specific due-out:
            5.2.6.3.1.1. Review applicable management notice or process inquiry in the
            appropriate IT system to obtain due-outs for asset.
            5.2.6.3.1.2. Enter the desired document number in the force DOR transaction in
            the ILS-S as outlined in Customer Due-Out-Release (DOR) in AFH 23-123, Vol
            2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
        5.2.6.3.2. To release automatically per the order of release table depicted in ILS-S
        Order Of Release Sequence Table in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
            5.2.6.3.2.1. Process force DOR transaction as outlined in Forced Due-Out
            Release (DOR) Input Transaction, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
  5.2.7. Modify Backorders.
120                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.2.7.1. Purpose: To explain the modification of established due-ins and due-outs. For
      policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
      23-123.
      5.2.7.2. General Discussion: When customer backorders require modification, the
      AFMC SCM-R or LRS/Materiel Management Activity (for non-AFMC SCM-R
      supported customers) prepares and processes a due-in/due-out update transaction.
      5.2.7.3. The following actions will be performed:
         5.2.7.3.1. The customer will submit the following information when backorder
         modification action is required:
             5.2.7.3.1.1. Stock number requested.
             5.2.7.3.1.2. Document number
             5.2.7.3.1.3. Requisition number
             5.2.7.3.1.4. Modification Requirement. The customer will identify any or all of
             the following data elements for modification:
                 5.2.7.3.1.4.1. Supplementary address.
                 5.2.7.3.1.4.2. Project code.
                 5.2.7.3.1.4.3. Force activity designator.
                 5.2.7.3.1.4.4. Mark-for.
                 5.2.7.3.1.4.5. Urgency justification code.
                 5.2.7.3.1.4.6. Required delivery date.
                 5.2.7.3.1.4.7. Ammo transaction code.
                 5.2.7.3.1.4.8. Authority for issue flag.
         5.2.7.3.2. For non-MICAP customer backorders, process Due-In/Due-Out Modifier
         (DIT) Input Transaction in due-in/due-out update transaction in the ILS-S in
         accordance with AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
         5.2.7.3.3. For MICAP customer backorders, process the appropriate MICAP
         Notification/Status transaction in the ILS-S in accordance with MICAP
         Notification/Status (NOR) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
             5.2.7.3.3.1. For MICAP customer backorders, AFMC SCM-R Weapon Systems
             Support Activity will ensure priority due-in details are deleted or changed when
             corresponding customer due-out details have been cancelled or downgraded.
  5.2.8. Requisition Follow-up.
      5.2.8.1. Purpose: To explain the requisition follow-up procedures to validate/obtain
      status. The AFMC SCM-R Activity is responsible for all requisition follow-up except for
      local routing identifiers, TCTOs, and non -MICAP part number requisitions. The
      LRS/Materiel Management Activity is responsible for local routing identifiers, TCTOs,
      and non-MICAP part number requisition follow-up. For policy specific requirements
      review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  121


     5.2.8.2. General Discussion: Use manual requisition follow-up procedures when
     automated (INLINE) Requisition follow-up transactions discussed in Requisition Follow-
     Up, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1 Ch 5 have not yielded the desired results, and mission
     requirements dictate improved status is required. Manual requisition follow-up
     processing may be conducted alone or in conjunction with automated follow-up
     processing.
     5.2.8.3. The following actions will be accomplished for manual requisition follow-up:
        5.2.8.3.1. The AFMC SCM-R will perform follow-up for all off-line lateral support
        requisitions when no shipment is loaded. See Requisition Follow-Up (AFC/FLP)
        Input Transactions in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for processing information and
        input transaction format.
        5.2.8.3.2. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will perform follow-up for local
        purchase, local manufacture, and non-MICAP part number requisitions when
        necessary.
            5.2.8.3.2.1. For local purchase requisitions with status, see Requisition Follow-
            Up in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for automated follow-up transaction format,
            frequency, and processing instructions.
            5.2.8.3.2.2. For local purchase requisitions without status, see Requisition
            Follow-Up in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for automated requisition
            reinstatement follow-up transaction processing instructions and transaction
            format.
            5.2.8.3.2.3. For local manufacture requisition follow-up, Requisition Follow-Up
            in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for more information and processing
            instructions.
        5.2.8.3.3. Priority requisition follow-up transaction. Utilize the priority requisition
        follow-up transaction for priority 01-08 requisitions containing unsatisfactory
        estimated delivery dates. See Requisition Follow-Up (AFC/FLP) Input Transactions
        in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for processing instructions and format.
        5.2.8.3.4. Action required transaction. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity is
        responsible for centrally managed item action required status images. The
        LRS/Materiel Management Activity is responsible for all routing identifier JXX
        action required transactions. See Requisition Follow-Up in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
        Ch 5 for transaction processing information and format.
        5.2.8.3.5. Supply assistance request message. When all other attempts have failed to
        acquire current or improved status for priority 01-08 requisitions, the supply
        assistance request message should be used. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity
        will assist customers with preparing supply difficulty and supply assistance requests
        for forwarding to the AFMC SCM-R Activity. The AFMC SCM-R will combine base
        inputs and submit assistance requests to the appropriate action ALC/ICP, and return
        responses to the initiators. The supply assistance request message informs the source
        of supply how the lack of the requisitioned item affects mission support. See
        MILSTRIP Supply Assistance Request Message Format in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
122                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013

         used by the Materiel Management Activity.
             5.2.8.3.5.1. Method to Request Supply Assistance. A request for assistance may
             be accomplished by electronic mail (computer--DDN), message, letter, or
             telephone to the appropriate supply source.
  5.2.9. Requisition Reconciliation.
      5.2.9.1. Purpose: To ensure requisitioned materiel is still required and valid. For policy
      specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.2.9.2. As this is a system intensive process, see Requisition Reconciliation in AFH 23-
      123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for processing instructions to automated responses using the ILS-S
      to ensure requisitioned materiel is still required and valid.
  5.2.10. Requisition Status.
      5.2.10.1. Purpose: To explain the requisition status procedures process. AFMC SCM-R
      manages status for centrally managed item requisitions. The LRS/Materiel Management
      Activity will manage status for local purchase, local manufacture and non-MICAP part
      number requisitions. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
      specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.2.10.2. General Discussion: AFMC SCM-R Activity/LRS/Materiel Management
      Activity personnel must ensure all status is processed immediately, no matter how the
      status is received. If status is not processed immediately, more workload may be created
      due to invalid follow-ups, receipt rejects, and requisition cancellations and billings.
      AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must establish management notice suspense files
      for status problems. Most status transactions are processed internally by the ILS-S,
      however some require external handling. AFMC SCM-R Activity/ LRS/Materiel
      Management Activity personnel must make decisions on each management notice
      received to correct individual status problems.
      5.2.10.3. The following actions will be accomplished in performing requisition status
      updates:
         5.2.10.3.1. F4(**) management notices. The ILS-S will produce F4** management
         notices to explain processing actions for each cancellation status code received. See
         AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for detailed instructions for each management notice.
             5.2.10.3.1.1. SRI. If a special requirement indicator is assigned to the due-in
             detail, the system will add a third line of print on the F4** management notice
             specifying the flag. See Special Requisition (SPR) Transaction in AFH 23-123,
             Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for more information concerning SRI assignment.
         5.2.10.3.2. Processing Cancellation/Rejection Status. AFMC SCM-R Activity/
         LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel will process rejection and cancellation
         status. The following paragraphs detail specific instructions for processing the most
         common types of rejection/cancellation status you will receive. See MILSTRIP,
         Intra-Air Force, And Intra-Base Requisition Status Codes and Phrases in AFH 23-
         123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for a complete list and explanation of each type of status code
         that may be received and for status transaction format and instructions.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                123


          5.2.10.3.2.1. Cancellation Status Code BF (No Record of Requisition). If the
          wholesale source of supply does not have a record of an ILS-S requisition, the
          wholesale supply system generates a status transaction with status code BF.
             5.2.10.3.2.1.1. Cancel the requirement. If the due-in and due-out should be
             canceled, enter TEX 9 in position 51 of the status transaction and re-input.
             5.2.10.3.2.1.2. Re-requisition the requirement. If the canceled quantity
             should be requisitioned again, enter TEX R in position 51 of the status
             transaction and re-input.
             5.2.10.3.2.1.3. Decrease the requirement. If the cancellation should be
             processed to delete or decrease only due-in details and corresponding status
             details, enter TEX P in position 51 of the status transaction and re-input.
             5.2.10.3.2.1.4. Current status exists. In this situation, do not re-input the
             status transaction. Take this action when due-in and status details exist in the
             ILS-S with current status. Note: Follow-up processing will force the source
             of supply to confirm they do not have a record of the requisition. See Para
             5.2.8 for more information concerning ILS-S follow-up processing.
          5.2.10.3.2.2. Cancellation Status Code CA. The source of supply notifies
          LRS/Materiel Management Activities of CA cancellations by message. The
          message explains the reason for the cancellation and any additional requirements.
          When the message is received, AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity processes a
          status (AE*) input transaction with status code CA. Note: Status code CA
          automatically assigns REX code 1 which prevents further requisitioning action for
          the item. See Requisition Exception (REX) Codes in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
          Ch 5 for a list of REX codes and associated processing instructions. If AFMC
          SCM-R Stock Control Activity does not receive the CA cancellation message, the
          ILS-S will generate subsequent follow-up (AF*) transactions to the supply source.
          See Para 5.2.8 for more information concerning requisition follow-up processing.
          Note: The supply source will not send another message to the base. When
          follow-up transactions are received by the supply source they send status (AE*)
          transactions with status code CA. When processed in the ILS-S, the CA status
          transaction will assign REX code 1 to the item record, update cancellation status
          codes on the routing identifier record, and output an F436 management notice.
          See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning F436
          management notices.
          5.2.10.3.2.3. Cancellation Status Code CW (One-Time Local Purchase). The
          ILS-S will generate a 421 Reject (input must be coded with TEX 9, P or R, and
          reprocessed) when requisitions are canceled with CW status. Use the following
          instructions to process CW cancellation status:
             5.2.10.3.2.3.1. If the canceled quantity will be locally procured to meet the
             requirement, prepare a DD Form 1348-6 according to the instructions in AFH
             23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. Attach a copy of the 421 Reject to copy 2 (and 3 if
             required) and send to Contracting. The 421 Reject indicates to Contracting
             this DD Form 1348-6 has been generated because of CW status. AFMC
124                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             SCM-R Stock Control Activity will submit a new requisition for the
             requirement.
             5.2.10.3.2.3.2. If a DD Form 1348-6 has been previously submitted on this
             item, and management decides to procure it locally, re-input the status
             transaction with TEX R in position 51. Do not send the DD Form 1348-6 and
             the 421 reject notice to the Base Contracting Office.
             5.2.10.3.2.3.3. If the due-in and due-out on the item should be canceled, enter
             TEX code 9 in position 51 of the status transaction and re-input.
             5.2.10.3.2.3.4. If the item cannot be locally procured, enter TEX P in position
             51 of the status transaction and re-input. This action will delete or decrease
             the due-in and status details. Submit a new requisition to the source of supply
             with advice code 2A.
             5.2.10.3.2.3.5. If the cancellation is for a local purchase due-in, only TEX
             codes 9 or R apply.
         5.2.10.3.2.4. Cancellation Status Codes ZG and ZH. For cancellation codes ZG
         (item permanently not available from Base Contracting) and ZH (item temporarily
         not available from Base Contracting), the ILS-S will delete the requisition and
         assign REX 1 to the item record. The primary course of action is to review the
         requirement for these items with the customer and work to find an acceptable
         substitute. If a substitute is discovered, re-requisition the substitute item with a
         new requisition number through Contracting. If a substitute cannot be found,
         assign REX 2 to the item record using a Stock Control Data (FCD) transaction.
         This action will allow requisitioning again from the primary source of supply as
         determined by the federal supply class/MMAC (FSC/MMAC) table. See
         management notice I964 in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
      5.2.10.3.3. Source of Supply Substitute and/or Equal Item Offers. The source of
      supply will notify the LRS/Materiel Management Activity through message or other
      correspondence when substitute and/or equal items are available to satisfy
      requisitions. When notified, Stock Control will first determine the unit price of the
      offered item. If the extended cost of the requisition is greater than $499.99, or the
      item is considered accountable equipment (ERRCD equals ND*), Stock Control will
      contact the customer to determine if the offered item is acceptable. If acceptable by
      the customer, instruct the source of supply to provide updated status (BH) containing
      the new (offered) stock number. If the offered item is not acceptable to the customer,
      instruct the source of supply to continue procurement (if possible) for the requested
      item. Note: The source of supply should establish a customer response suspense
      date. However, if a customer response suspense date is not provided by the source of
      supply, Stock Control should submit the customer response (acceptance/non-
      acceptance) to the source of supply within 7 workdays.
      5.2.10.3.4. Request for Missing Requisition Information. BD status suspends the
      requisition in the wholesale supply system for 30 calendar days awaiting Item
      Manager review and action. Bases have 30 days to provide requested information. If
      the supply source does not receive requested information within 30 calendar days, the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 125


        supply source cancels the requisition using status code D3 (Canceled). See
        MILSTRIP, Intra-Air Force, And Intra-Base Requisition Status Codes and Phrases in
        AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 or more information concerning D3 status processing.
  5.2.11. Requisition Tracing.
     5.2.11.1. Purpose: To explain the requisition tracing procedures process. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.2.11.2. General Discussion: When requisitions (shipments) become overdue or lost in
     transportation channels, the ILS-S initiates tracer action through government and
     commercial transportation sources. Tracer action is also used to recover the lost
     shipment. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity managers use the Military Standard
     Transportation and Movement Procedures (MILSTAMP) Tracer Reconciliation program
     to trace and resolve lost or misplaced requisitions (shipments) that contain an ILS-S
     shipment status detail. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity must ensure that all
     required tracing actions are completed on schedule.
     5.2.11.3. The following actions will be performed for requisition tracing:
        5.2.11.3.1. AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity will process the
        MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation program on the first and third weekend of each
        month. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for more information about the
        MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation program, output products, and distribution
        instructions.
        5.2.11.3.2. Managing the Tracer Action Reconciliation. The ILS-S MILSTAMP
        Tracer Reconciliation Program creates the Transportation Tracer Listing and tracer
        action required transaction images for CONUS, and SHIPMENT TRACER
        FOLLOW-UP transaction images for OCONUS bases. Customer Support uses the
        Transportation Tracer list and output transaction images to determine what, when,
        and how shipment tracing actions should occur. See Requisition Tracing in AFH 23-
        123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for tracer action required processing instructions.
            5.2.11.3.2.1. Customer Support Initial Actions.
                5.2.11.3.2.1.1. Review the List for Repeat Entries. Before any other
                processing action is taken, compare the new list to the previous list. If all
                actions from the previous list have not been completed, then the new listing
                will contain repeat entries. Line off any repeat entries on the new list and
                complete the required actions on the previous list. Set up controls to ensure
                timely processing of the listings and completion of required action before the
                next list is run.
                5.2.11.3.2.1.2. Delete Items. Process a tracer action required image with an
                asterisk (*) in position 7 for Unclassified and Pilferable items with a dollar
                value of less than $100 to immediately delete them. Any other item will be
                reported as a SDR regardless of dollar value, after the Cargo Movement
                confirms that the shipment was lost, destroyed, or Proof of Delivery could not
                be furnished. Follow procedures outlined in AFJMAN 23-215, Reporting of
                Supply Discrepancies for SDR reporting. SDR reporting is also applicable to
126                                                 AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         unclassified and pilferable items above $100, after the Cargo Movements
         confirms that the shipment was lost, destroyed, or Proof of Delivery could not
         be furnished. Use the ES-S SDR function or the DoD Web-SDRs as the
         primary means to submit SDRs and SF 364 when the ES-S SDR function or
         the DoD Web-SDR system is not available.
         5.2.11.3.2.1.3. Processing Output Products. Processing the Transportation
         Tracer Listing program will produce DD Form 1348-1A, I306, and/or I198,
         I116, and F080 management notice(s). Process the output as follows:
           5.2.11.3.2.1.3.1. Shipped-short receipt. Send the short-shipped receipt
           (I306 management notice) to Document Control for filing.
           5.2.11.3.2.1.3.2. F080 management notice. If an F080 management notice
           is produced, write the following message on the front of the F080: DOES
           NOT MEET DOLLAR REPORTING CRITERIA. PLEASE DELETE
           CLAIMS RECEIVABLE DETAIL. Send the notice to Accounting and
           Finance for their action.
           5.2.11.3.2.1.3.3. Management notice distribution. Route the I198 and/or
           I116 management notices to the appropriate work center for processing. See
           AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning I198 and
           I116 management notices.
         5.2.11.3.2.1.4. Distribute the Listing. Send copies 1 and 2 of the list to
         Document Control for screening.
      5.2.11.3.2.2. Document Control Action. Document Control will check each entry
      on the listing against the Document Control receipt suspense and completed files
      to determine if the shipment has been received. Verify the complete 14 position
      document number against the receipt files, paying close attention to any suffix
      code. Annotate the listing for items that have been received with RECEIVED or
      IN FILE (DATE). Document Control will return both copies of the listing to
      Customer Support within 3 workdays of receiving the listing.
      5.2.11.3.2.3. Customer Support Subsequent Actions Following Document
      Control Review.
         5.2.11.3.2.3.1. Processing Actions for Items Marked Received or In File
         (Date) by Document Control.
           5.2.11.3.2.3.1.1. Prior to forwarding the transportation tracer list to Cargo
           Movement for processing, take immediate action to line through those
           entries that Document Control has marked as received or in file (date).
           Coordinate with Cargo Movement to ensure they understand no action is
           needed on these items. Note: If Customer Support chooses to take action
           on these items prior to forwarding the listing to Cargo Movement, extreme
           care must be taken to not delay Cargo Movement processing of the listing.
           5.2.11.3.2.3.1.2. Immediately forward the listing to Cargo Movement for
           their actions.
      5.2.11.3.2.4. Cargo Movement Actions.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       127


                  5.2.11.3.2.4.1. Cargo Movement will work tracer action listing IAW AFI 24-
                  203.
               5.2.11.3.2.5. Customer Support Subsequent Actions Following Cargo Movement
               Review.
                  5.2.11.3.2.5.1. Screening Cargo Movement Statements. After receiving the
                  annotated Transportation Tracer Listing from Cargo Movement, ensure only
                  valid statements listed in AFI 24-203 are used. If the listing includes other
                  statements, return the listing to Cargo Movement for corrective action as
                  described in AFI 24-203.
                  5.2.11.3.2.5.2. Based upon Cargo Movement remarks; complete the following
                  actions:
                    5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1. Received or in file (date). First check the transaction
                    history to see if shipped status transactions processed after a partial receipt.
                        5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.1. If the transaction history indicates a partial receipt
                        (with the same suffix code as the tracer action required detail) before
                        updated shipment status processed, process a tracer action required
                        transaction with a D in position 7 to delete corresponding shipment
                        status details.
                        5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.2. If a partial receipt is not involved, and Cargo
                        Movement indicates the shipment has been received on base, process a
                        tracer action required transaction with action code A to update the
                        transportation tracer flag on the shipment status detail to A. Action code
                        A will move the shipment to the Receipt Acknowledged Error Listing
                        indicating the shipment has been received on base but not by
                        LRS/Materiel Management Activity.
                        5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3. Customer Support will take the following actions
                        after processing the tracer action required transaction with action code
                        A:
5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.1. Receipt processing. If the receipt processed incorrectly, rejected, reverse-
posted, or did not process, take action to correctly process the receipt.
5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.2. No receipt. If the receipt cannot be located, prepare a DD Form 1348-1A
(Shipped-Short) receipt and process it as follows:
5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.2.1. Shipment received. Check with the customer to determine if the customer
physically received the shipment. If the customer received the shipment, create a DD 1348-1A
receipt document and briefly explain on the front how this determination was made. The
Customer Support supervisor or Materiel Management Officer will certify the customer receipt
statement. Furthermore, ensure the receipt has processed correctly and have the customer sign
the Due-Out Release (DOR) document acknowledging receipt for the shipment. Customer
Support will annotate the listing with actions taken, attach supporting documentation, and send
all documentation to Document Control for filing.
 128                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.2.2. Shipment not received. If the customer has not received the shipment,
prepare a DD 1348-1A receipt and attach a copy of the supporting documentation. Next, send all
documentation to Inventory for special inventory processing. See Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory
and Inventory Adjustments of this chapter for inventory processing.
                   5.2.11.3.2.5.2.2. Cargo Movement tracing. This annotation indicates Cargo
                   Movement will trace the shipment through transportation channels.
                   Customer Support will process the tracer action required transaction with a
                   B in position 7 to indicate the shipment is being traced through
                   transportation channels and updated status will be provided. Note: Cargo
                   Movement monitors all items being traced through transportation channels
                   to ensure the tracing is completed before shipments appear 30 days later on
                   the Exception Action Listing.
                   5.2.11.3.2.5.2.3. Updated shipment status.      If the LRS/transportation
                   activity provides updated shipment status, Customer Support will process a
                   shipment status input transaction with updated date shipped, mode of
                   shipment code, Transportation Control number (TCN) or Government Bill
                   of Lading (GBL), as noted by Cargo Movement. See Shipment Suspense
                   Record (SSC) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for shipment status input
                   transaction format and processing instructions.
                   5.2.11.3.2.5.2.4. SF 361/Message Attached. When Cargo Movement
                   annotates the Transportation Tracer Listing with SF 361/Message Attached,
                   Customer Support will process a tracer action required transaction with an
                   asterisk (*) in position 7. This annotation indicates tracer action was
                   unsuccessful and the shipment is considered lost. At this point, Customer
                   Support will prepare a Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) via the ES-S SDR
                   function or the DoD Web SDR system to the shipping activity and include
                   results of the tracer action and attach any pertinent documentation. Use the
                   SF 364 in the absence of the ES-S SDR function or the DoD WebSDR
                   system. Processing the tracer action required transaction will produce an
                   I306 management notice for a shipped-short receipt. Additionally, the tracer
                   action required transaction will delete the corresponding due-in detail and
                   change the shipment status detail supplementary address to TARREC. This
                   processing is used to identify tracer action required shipped-short receipt
                   processing. Note: If the shortage meets dollar value requirements specified
                   in DFAS-DE 7077.10-M, the ILS-S will create a Claims Receivable detail
                   and an F080 management notice.
                       5.2.11.3.2.5.2.4.1. F080 management notice produced. If an F080
                       management notice is produced, send a copy of the SF 361 received
                       from Cargo Movement to Accounting and Finance for action. Customer
                       Support will process a tracer action required transaction with action code
                       C to prevent the lost shipment from appearing on the Report of Item
                       Discrepancy (ROD) Listing.
                       5.2.11.3.2.5.2.4.2. F080 management notice not produced. If an F080
                       management notice is not produced, attach a copy of the SF 361
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                129


                   (received from Cargo Movement) and the I306 management notice
                   (shipped-short receipt), and send both to Document Control for action.
                   Process a tracer action required transaction with action code C to prevent
                   the lost shipment from appearing on the Report of Item Discrepancy
                   (ROD) Listing.
               5.2.11.3.2.5.2.5. Previously researched by Cargo Movement. Customer
               Support should check the previous Transportation Tracer Listing to
               determine why previously identified processing was not completed.
               Customer Support will line off any duplicate entries on the new listing and
               return it to Cargo Movement for processing. Immediately complete all
               processing actions from the previous listing and set up controls to prevent
               the condition from happening again.
               5.2.11.3.2.5.2.6. Shipment Tracer Follow-up action required (overseas
               bases only). When Cargo Movement returns the Transportation Tracer
               Listing for overseas (OCONUS) bases with the annotation “SHIPMENT
               TRACER FOLLOW-UP Action Required,” Customer Support will process
               these shipments as follows:
                   5.2.11.3.2.5.2.6.1. Processing tracer action required transaction. If the
                   shipment is being traced by Cargo Movement through shipment tracer
                   follow-up transactions, process the tracer action required transaction
                   with a B in position 7.
                   5.2.11.3.2.5.2.6.2. Obtain updated shipment status from the AF shipper
                   service control office (SSCO). Overseas bases send shipment tracer
                   follow-up transactions to the AF Shipper Service Control Office (SSCO)
                   or HQ AFMC for tracer actions. See Tracer Action Request (TM1)
                   Transaction For Overseas Bases in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for
                   shipment tracer follow-up transaction format and processing
                   instructions. When SSCO receives and processes shipment tracer
                   follow-up transactions, shipment status reply (TMA) transactions are
                   created and transmitted (by message or email) to the ILS-S to provide
                   updated transportation information.
                   5.2.11.3.2.5.2.6.3. Processing SSCO Updates. Upon receipt, process
                   tracer action request reply transactions in the ILS-S. Conversely, if a
                   message or email is received from the SSCO, Customer Support will
                   prepare and process a tracer action request reply transaction using the
                   format listed in Tracer Action Request Reply (TMA) Transaction For
                   Overseas Bases in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Tracer action request
                   reply transaction processing updates shipment status details with
                   updated transportation information (day shipped/mode/TCN/GBL).
                   Note: No reply to tracer action within 30 days will cause the shipments
                   to appear on the Exception Action Listing. See Para 5.2.11.3.6 for more
                   information concerning the Exception Action Listing.
          5.2.11.3.2.6. File the Completed Listing. Keep the current Transportation Tracer
          Listing on file in Customer Support. Retain with the previous listing until the
130                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         next scheduled listing is produced.
      5.2.11.3.3. Parcel Post Tracer Listing (TTF-P) Processing.
         5.2.11.3.3.1. The Parcel Post Tracer List is created to identify and trace
         shipments shipped by parcel post (mode of shipment code G or H), military
         ordinary mail (mode of shipment code 6), or express mail (mode of shipment code
         7) that exceed MILSTAMP standards. Note: If processing is not completed on
         the current listing, the shipments will appear on subsequent Parcel Post Tracer
         Listings.
         5.2.11.3.3.2. Customer Support Action. Customer Support will review the Parcel
         Post Tracer Listing and take the following actions:
             5.2.11.3.3.2.1. Deleting Shipments. Unclassified and Pilferable shipments
             with a dollar value of less than $100 should be immediately deleted by
             processing a tracer action required transaction with an asterisk (*) in position
             7. Any other item with a controlled item code (CIC) other than U will be
             reported as a SDR regardless of dollar value, after the U.S. Postal Service
             confirms that the shipment was lost, destroyed, or Proof of Delivery could not
             be furnished. Follow procedures outlined in AFJMAN 23-215 for SDR
             reporting. SDR reporting is also applicable to unclassified and pilferable
             items above $100, after Cargo Movement confirms that the shipment was lost,
             destroyed, or Proof of Delivery could not be furnished. Use the ES-S SDR
             function or the DoD Web-SDRs as the primary means to submit SDRs and SF
             364 when the ES-S SDR function or the Web-SDR system is not available.
             Note: Processing the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation (NGV597) program
             with the delete option will automatically delete items (CIC equals U) with a
             dollar value of less than $100.00. See MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation
             (NGV597) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for more information on deleting
             lost shipments valued less than $100.
             5.2.11.3.3.2.2. Tracer action required Processing Output. Tracer action
             required transaction processing produces a DD Form 1348-1A (shipped-short)
             receipt document, and I306, I198, I116, and F080 management notice(s).
             Process the output as follows:
               5.2.11.3.3.2.2.1. Send the I306 management notice (short-shipped receipt)
               to Document Control.
               5.2.11.3.3.2.2.2. Write the following message on the front of the F080
               management notice:        DOES NOT MEET DOLLAR REPORTING
               CRITERIA. PLEASE DELETE CLAIMS RECEIVABLE DETAIL. Send
               the notice to Accounting and Finance for their action.
               5.2.11.3.3.2.2.3. Route the I198 and/or I116 management notices to the
               appropriate work center for processing. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7.
               for more information and processing instructions.
             5.2.11.3.3.2.3. Annotate the Listing. After processing tracer action required
             transactions and any related output as described above, cross the shipment off
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   131


             of the listing.
             5.2.11.3.3.2.4. Designate Controlled and Uncontrolled Shipments. Parcel
             post shipments are mail-type shipments that are divided into two large
             categories: Controlled and Uncontrolled. To determine if shipments are
             controlled or uncontrolled, check position 7 of the TCN/GBL field of the
             Parcel Post Tracer List. Controlled shipments are identified by the following
             characters: C (Certified), I (Insured), or R (Registered). If position 7 does not
             contain one of these characters, then the shipment is considered uncontrolled.
             5.2.11.3.3.2.5. Distribute the Listing. Distribute the Parcel Post Tracer listing
             according to the following instructions:
               5.2.11.3.3.2.5.1. Controlled shipment tracing.       For tracing controlled
               shipments (identified by a C, I, or R in position 7 of the TCN/GBL), send
               the Parcel Post Tracer Listing to Document Control and Receiving (if
               applicable) sections to determine if the shipments have been received.
               5.2.11.3.3.2.5.2. Uncontrolled shipment tracing. For tracing uncontrolled
               shipments, send the listing to Document Control.
          5.2.11.3.3.3. Document Control Action. Document Control will check each entry
          on the Parcel Post Tracer Listing against Document Control receipt suspense files
          and completed receipt files to determine if the shipment has been received.
          Verify the complete requisition (shipment) document number, paying close
          attention to the suffix code. Mark shipments on the list that have been received
          with RECEIVED or IN FILE (DATE). If the item has not been received, mark
          the item with the statement, NO RECORD. Document Control will return the list
          to Customer Support within 5 workdays of receiving the listing.
          5.2.11.3.3.4. Customer Support Processing of Annotated Parcel Post Tracer List.
             5.2.11.3.3.4.1. RECEIVED or In File (Date). Customer Support will check
             the transaction history to see if shipped status processed after a partial receipt.
             If the transaction history shows a partial receipt processed (with the same
             suffix code as the tracer action required detail) before shipment status
             processed, process a tracer action required transaction with Action Code D in
             position 7 to delete the shipment status detail. If a partial shipment is not
             applicable, Customer Support will process a tracer action required transaction
             with Action Code A in position 7 to reset the transportation tracer flag (TTF)
             on the shipment status detail to A, and indicate shipment will appear on the
             Receipt Acknowledged Error Listing. Note: Shipments appearing on the
             Receipt Acknowledged Error Listing identifies shipments received on base
             but not received in LRS/Materiel Management Activity. See Para 5.2.11.3.4
             for more information. After processing a tracer action required transaction
             with action code A, Customer Support will perform the following actions:
               5.2.11.3.3.4.1.1. Receipt processing.        Determine if the receipt was
               processed correctly. If it was processed incorrectly, rejected, reverse-
               posted, or did not process, take action to correctly process the receipt.
132                                             AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


       5.2.11.3.3.4.1.2. No receipt. If the receipt cannot be located, prepare a DD
       Form 1348-1A (shipped-short receipt) and process it as follows:
          5.2.11.3.3.4.1.2.1. Shipment received. If it can be determined the
          customer actually received the item, briefly explain on the front of the
          DD Form 1348-1A how this decision was made. The Customer Support
          Supervisor or Materiel Management Officer must certify this statement.
          Customer Support will ensure the receipt is processed and the customer
          signs the due-out release (DOR) document to acknowledge physical
          receipt of the shipment. Customer Support annotates the list with action
          taken and sends the documents to Document Control for filing.
          5.2.11.3.3.4.1.2.2. Shipment not received. If the customer has not
          received the item, send the I306 management notice (shipped-short)
          receipt, along with a copy of the transaction history to Inventory for
          special inventory processing. If special inventory action validates a
          shortage, Inventory must process an inventory adjustment transaction
          with a TEX code T. Inventory returns the receipt, a copy of the
          transaction history research, and any output from the inventory to
          Customer Support. Customer Support annotates the list with action
          taken and sends all documentation to Document Control for filing.
      5.2.11.3.3.4.2. Processing controlled shipments – NO RECORD.  If
      Document Control or Receiving marks the shipment with NO RECORD,
      Customer Support will perform the following actions:
       5.2.11.3.3.4.2.1. Prepare parcel post shipment tracing transaction. To
       initiate tracing on controlled Parcel Post shipments, process a tracer action
       required transaction with action code T in position 7 to create an output
       parcel post tracing transaction. Action code T flags the ILS-S shipment
       status detail to indicate an output parcel post tracing transaction has been
       created. See Registered, Insured, and Certified Parcel Post Shipment
       Tracing (AFT) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for transaction format and
       processing instructions.
       5.2.11.3.3.4.2.2. Request shipment tracing. Send the output parcel post
       tracing transaction to the correct source of supply, to begin tracer action
       with the U.S. Postal Service. Once the source of supply determines
       shipment disposition, they will send an offline message to the Materiel
       Management Activity. If no response is received within 15 days, ILS-S
       inline follow-up programs will send another output parcel post tracing
       transaction.
       5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3. Lost or destroyed shipments. If the postal service indicates
       the shipment was lost, destroyed, or proof of delivery could not be
       furnished, Customer Support will take the following actions:
          5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.1. Process tracer action required transaction. Customer
          Support will process a tracer action required transaction with action code
          asterisk (*). Once processed, the ILS-S will build a shipped-short
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                        133


                         receipt, delete the due-in detail, and change the supplementary address
                         field of the shipment status detail to TARREC. ILS-S processing will
                         produce an I306 management notice (shipped-short receipt).
                         Additionally, tracer action required transaction processing builds a billed
                         not received delete transaction for Accounting and Finance program
                         NGV960.
                         5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.2. Parcel post shipments with special dollar value
                         requirements. If the parcel post shortage meets the dollar value
                         requirements specified in DFAS-DE 7077.10-M, a claims receivable
                         detail and an F080 management notice is produced. Upon receipt of the
                         F080 management notice, prepare and forward a SDR using the ES-S
                         SDR function or the DoD WebSDR to the shipping activity. Use the SF
                         364 in the absence of the ES-S SDR function or the DoD WebSDR
                         system. If the extended value is greater than $250 for a DoD shipment
                         or greater than $100 for a non-DoD shipment, request reverse billing or
                         credit action on the ES-S SDR function or the DoD WebSDR system.
                         5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.3. Process a tracer action required transaction with
                         action code C in position 7 to indicate an SDR was prepared. This
                         action will prevent the shipment from appearing on the Report of Item
                         Discrepancy Listing. Note: A tracer action required transaction with
                         action code Asterisk (*) must be processed first or a 112 REJ will be
                         produced.
                         5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.4. Distribute Copies of the SDR. Attach a copy of the
                         SDR to the DD Form 1348-1A (shipped-short receipt) and send it to
                         Document Control for filing.
5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.4.1. If a reverse-billing or credit action is not requested because of the item's
dollar value, send a copy of the SDR to Accounting and Finance requesting the detail be deleted.
5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.4.2. If a reverse billing or credit action is requested because of the item's dollar
value, keep a copy of the SDR in a suspense file until receipt of a reply. When a response is
received that either grants or refuses credit, send the SDR and response to A&F for required
action.
                     5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4. Delivered Shipments. If the post office indicates proof of
                     delivery, take the following actions:
                         5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.1. Process the tracer action required transaction with
                         action taken code A in position 7. This action will place the shipment on
                         the Receipt Acknowledged Error Listing portion of the Tracer Action
                         Required Listing.
                         5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.2. Process the receipt if it can be located.
                         5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.3. Prepare a DD Form 1348-1A (shipped-short receipt)
                         if the receipt cannot be located and process as follows:
 134                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.3.1. Shipment received. If it can be determined the customer received the
shipment, briefly explain on the front of the DD Form 1348-1A how this determination was
made. The Customer Support supervisor or Materiel Management Officer will certify the
determination statement. Ensure the receipt is processed and the customer signs the Due-Out
Release (DOR) document acknowledging actual possession of the item. Customer Support
annotates the listing with actions taken and sends to Document Control.
5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.3.2. Shipment not received. If the customer did not receive the shipment, send
the receipt, along with a copy of the transaction history, to Inventory for special inventory
processing. If the special inventory shows there is a shortage, Inventory must process an IRC
with a TEX code T. Inventory returns the receipt, a copy of the transaction history, and any
output from the inventory to Customer Support. Customer Support annotates the list with action
taken and sends the documents to Document Control for filing.
                  5.2.11.3.3.4.3. Processing Uncontrolled Shipments Not Received.
                  Uncontrolled parcel post shipments cannot be traced. If Document Control
                  indicates the shipment was not received (NO RECORD), Customer Support
                  will process a tracer action required transaction with Action Code asterisk (*).
                  The ILS-S will build a shipped-short receipt, delete the due-in detail, and
                  change the supplementary address field of the shipment status detail to
                  TARREC. ILS-S processing will also produce an I306 management notice
                  (shipped-short receipt). At this point, Customer Support will prepare a SDR
                  via the ES-S SDR function or the DoD Web SDR system to the shipping
                  activity and include results of the tracer actions from the U.S. Postal Service
                  and attach any pertinent documentation. In the Absence of the ES-S SDR
                  function or the DoD WebSDR system, use SF 364. Additionally, ILS-S tracer
                  action required transaction processing builds a BNR delete transaction for
                  Accounting and Finance.
           5.2.11.3.4. Receipt Acknowledged Error Listing (TTF-A) Processing.
              5.2.11.3.4.1. This list includes lost or delayed shipments that the
              LRS/Transportation activity has received but the shipment has not been received
              by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. The Receipt Acknowledged Error
              Listing also identifies those shipments that were shipped by pilot/consignee
              pickup.
              5.2.11.3.4.2. Customer Support Processing.
                  5.2.11.3.4.2.1. Overdue Receipts. Check previous Transportation or Parcel
                  Post Tracer Action listings to see what action was started to clear the overdue
                  receipt. Immediately resume action to clear these receipts.
                  5.2.11.3.4.2.2. Pilot/Consignee Shipments. If the TCN/GBL field contains
                  Pilot/ Consignee, then transportation channels were not used for this shipment.
                    5.2.11.3.4.2.2.1. Shipment received. Contact the customer and determine
                    how and when the item was picked up and delivered. Locate and process
                    the receipt.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                135


               5.2.11.3.4.2.2.2. Shipment not received. Prepare a DD Form 1348-1A
               (shipped-short receipt) if the receipt cannot be located and process it as
               follows:
                   5.2.11.3.4.2.2.2.1. If it can be determined the customer actually received
                   the item, briefly explain on the front of the DD Form 1348-1A how this
                   decision was made. Then have the Customer Support supervisor or
                   Materiel Management Officer certify the statement. Ensure the receipt
                   is processed and the customer signs the DOR acknowledging actual
                   possession of the item. Customer Support annotates the list with action
                   taken and sends the documents to Document Control for filing.
                   5.2.11.3.4.2.2.2.2. If the customer has not received the item, send the
                   receipt, along with a copy of the transaction history, to Inventory for
                   special inventory processing. If the special inventory shows there is a
                   shortage, Inventory must process an IRC with a TEX code T. Inventory
                   returns the receipt, a copy of the transaction history research, and any
                   output from the inventory to Customer Support. Customer Support
                   annotates the list with action taken and sends the documents to
                   Document Control for filing.
       5.2.11.3.5. Consolidated Shipment Error Listing (TTF-L) Processing
          5.2.11.3.5.1. This listing traces consolidated shipments that exceed age
          requirements and are identified by a lead transportation control number.
          5.2.11.3.5.2. Customer Support Action.
              5.2.11.3.5.2.1. Deleting Shipments. Unclassified and Pilferable items with a
              dollar value of less than $100 should be immediately deleted by processing a
              tracer action transaction image with an asterisk (*) in position 7. Any other
              item with a controlled item code (CIC) other than U will be reported as a SDR
              regardless of dollar value, after research by Customer Support and Document
              Control confirms that the shipment was lost, destroyed, or Proof of Delivery
              could not be furnished. Follow procedures outlined in AFJMAN 23-215 for
              SDR processing. Note: Processing the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation
              (NGV597) program with the delete option will automatically delete items
              (CIC equals U) with a dollar value of less than $100.00. See AFH 23-123,
              Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for more information and processing options for the
              MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation program.
              5.2.11.3.5.2.2. Processing Output.      Processing tracer action required
              transactions with action code asterisk (*) will produce an I306 management
              notice (shipped-short receipt), I198, I116, and F080 management notices.
              Process the output as follows:
               5.2.11.3.5.2.2.1. I306 management notice (shipped-short receipt). Send the
               short-shipped receipt (I306 management notice) to Document Control.
               5.2.11.3.5.2.2.2. F080 management notice annotation. Write the following
               statement on the front of the F080 management notice: DOES NOT MEET
136                                                  AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


           DOLLAR REPORTING CRITERIA.               PLEASE DELETE CLAIMS
           RECEIVABLE DETAIL. Send the annotated F080 management notice to
           Accounting and Finance (A&F) for action.
           5.2.11.3.5.2.2.3. Other management notice distribution. Route I198 and/or
           I116 management notices to the appropriate work center for processing. See
           AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information.
         5.2.11.3.5.2.3. Annotate the Listing. After processing tracer action required
         transactions and capturing any output, cross the shipment off the listing.
           5.2.11.3.5.2.4. Distribute the Listing. Send the listing to Document Control
           for their action.
      5.2.11.3.5.3. Document Control Action. Document Control will screen the lead
      TCN and the document number against the completed receipt files to determine if
      shipments have been received. Verify the complete document number, paying
      close attention to the suffix code. Mark received items with RECEIVED or IN
      FILE (DATE). Mark shipments that have not been received with NO RECORD.
      Document Control will return the annotated listing to Customer Support within 5
      workdays.
      5.2.11.3.5.4. Customer Support Action.
         5.2.11.3.5.4.1. Supplemental Shipments Received. If Document Control
         annotates the listing for supplemental due-in details (document number) as
         RECEIVED or IN FILE (DATE), determine if the receipt was processed
         correctly. If the receipt was processed incorrectly, rejected, reverse-posted, or
         did not process, then reprocess the receipt correctly.
         5.2.11.3.5.4.2. Supplemental Shipments Not Received. Prepare a DD Form
         1348-1A (shipped-short receipt) if you cannot find the receipt and process it
         as follows:
           5.2.11.3.5.4.2.1. If the customer actually received the item, briefly explain
           on the front of the DD Form 1348-1A how this determination was made.
           The Customer Support supervisor or Materiel Management Officer will
           certify this statement. Additionally, ensure the receipt is processed correctly
           and the customer signs the due-out release (DOR) document acknowledging
           receipt of the item. Customer Support annotates the listing with these
           actions taken and sends the document(s) to Document Control.
           5.2.11.3.5.4.2.2. If the customer has not received the item, send the receipt,
           along with a copy of the transaction history, to Inventory for special
           inventory processing. If the special inventory shows there is a shortage,
           Inventory must process an IRC with a TEX code T. Inventory returns the
           receipt, a copy of the transaction history research, and any output from the
           inventory to Customer Support. Customer Support annotates the list with
           action taken and sends the documents to Document Control for filing.
         5.2.11.3.5.4.3. Consolidated Shipments Not Received. If Document Control
         annotates the lead TCN and supplemental shipments as NO RECORD,
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 137


              Customer Support will research the lead TCN to determine what happened to
              the requisition number (due-in). Note: The Consolidated Shipment Error
              Listing does not include the stock number (NSN) for the lead TCN.
              Therefore, research the transaction history for the TCN document number date
              to determine the stock number.
                5.2.11.3.5.4.3.1. After identifying the lead TCN NSN, Customer Support
                will perform another transaction history to determine if the lead TCN
                requisition (due-in) was previously deleted. If the lead TCN due-in detail
                was deleted, reestablish the due-in document number in the ILS-S with a
                special requisition transaction.
                5.2.11.3.5.4.3.2. Prepare and process a shipment status transaction using the
                latest shipment data available on each supplemental due-in detail. If research
                indicates a receipt was processed, determine if the receipt processed
                correctly.
                   5.2.11.3.5.4.3.2.1. If correct, prepare a receipt document (DD Form
                   1348-1A) for Document Control. Delete any erroneous shipment status
                   details with tracer action required transactions using Action Code D.
                   5.2.11.3.5.4.3.2.2. If incorrect, reverse-post and reprocess the receipt
                   correctly. If you cannot obtain current shipment status because of the
                   age of the lead TCN, process a tracer action required transaction with
                   Action Code D. Cancel any supplemental due-in details for the
                   consolidated shipment with a supply status transaction using
                   cancellation code Z7. See Supply Status (AE*) Input Transaction in
                   AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for supply status transaction processing
                   instructions. Note: If the consolidated or supplemental shipments are
                   received by the Materiel Management Activity at a later date, process
                   the receipt(s) using receipt not due-in (RNDI) procedures.
       5.2.11.3.6. Exception Action Listing (TTF-F) Processing.
          5.2.11.3.6.1. This listing identifies delayed or lost shipments Cargo Movement
          marked as Cargo Movement TRACING on previous Transportation Tracer
          Listings. Note: For overseas (OCONUS) bases, the Exception Action Listing
          also identifies shipments for which a shipment tracer follow-up transaction has
          been submitted. However, no shipment tracer follow-up reply transaction has
          been received.
          5.2.11.3.6.2. Customer Support Initial Action. Send the Exception Action Listing
          to Cargo Movements for action.
          5.2.11.3.6.3. Cargo Movement Action. Within 5 workdays of receipt, Cargo
          Movement will research and annotate the Exception Action List with one of the
          following statements.
              5.2.11.3.6.3.1. Received or In File (Date). This annotation indicates Cargo
              Movement received the shipment on base and sent it to LRS/Materiel
              Management Activity for their action.
138                                                  AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.2.11.3.6.3.2. SF 361/Message Attached. This annotation indicates the
         shipment was lost in the transportation channels.
         5.2.11.3.6.3.3. Updated Shipment Status. This annotation indicates Cargo
         Movement received updated shipment data. Cargo Movement will circle the
         old shipment data and write the new shipment data above the old information.
      5.2.11.3.6.4. Customer Support Action following Cargo Movement Review.
      After receiving the annotated Exception Action Listing from Cargo Movement,
      check to see if it contains any statements other than those listed above. If the
      listing includes other statements, return it to Cargo Movement for their action, as
      stated in AFI 24-203. Otherwise, complete the following actions based upon
      Cargo Movement statements annotated:
         5.2.11.3.6.4.1. Received or In File (Date). Process the tracer action required
         transaction with Action Code A to indicate that the shipment processed
         through Cargo Movement channels, but has not been received by
         LRS/Materiel Management Activity. See if the receipt was processed
         correctly. If it was processed incorrectly, rejected, reverse-posted, or did not
         process, take action to correctly process the receipt. If the receipt cannot be
         located, prepare a DD Form 1348-1A (shipped-short receipt) and process it as
         follows:
           5.2.11.3.6.4.1.1. Shipment received. If the customer received the item,
           briefly explain on the front of the DD Form 1348-1A how this decision was
           made. The Customer Support supervisor or Materiel Management Officer
           will certify the statement. Ensure the receipt is processed in the ILS-S and
           the customer signs the DOR acknowledging actual possession of the item.
           Customer Support annotates the listing with action taken and sends the
           listing and supporting documents to Document Control.
           5.2.11.3.6.4.1.2. Shipment not received. If the customer has not received
           the item, send the shipped-short receipt, along with a copy of the transaction
           history, to Inventory for special inventory processing. If the special
           inventory shows there is a shortage, Inventory must process an IRC with a
           TEX code T. Inventory returns the receipt, a copy of the transaction history
           research, and any output from the inventory to Customer Support. Customer
           Support annotates the list with action taken and sends the documents to
           Document Control for filing.
         5.2.11.3.6.4.2. SF 361/Message Attached. When Cargo Movement annotates
         the Transportation Tracer Listing with SF 361/Message Attached, Customer
         Support will process a tracer action required transaction with an asterisk (*) in
         position 7 to indicate tracer action was unsuccessful and the shipment is
         considered lost. At this point, Customer Support will prepare a Supply
         Discrepancy Report (SDR) via the ES-S SDR function or the DoD Web SDR
         system to the shipping activity and include results of the tracer action and
         attach any pertinent documentation. In the Absence of the ES-S SDR function
         or the DoD WebSDR system, use SF 364. The tracer action required
         transaction will produce an I306 management notice (short-shipped receipt),
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  139


                delete the corresponding due-in detail, and change the shipment status detail
                supplementary address field to TARREC. Additionally, if the shortage meets
                the dollar value requirements specified in DFAS-DE 7077.10-M, the ILS-S
                will produce a Claims Receivable detail, and produce a F080 management
                notice.
                  5.2.11.3.6.4.2.1. F080 management notice produced.              If an F080
                  management notice is produced, send a copy of the SF 361 from Cargo
                  Movement to Accounting and Finance for their action. Customer Support
                  will process a tracer action required transaction with Action Code C in
                  position 7 to prevent the shipment from appearing on the Report of Item
                  Discrepancy Listing. Note: Process a tracer action required transaction
                  with action code asterisk (*) first to prevent a 112 Reject. See AFH 23-123,
                  Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning 198 Rejects.
                  5.2.11.3.6.4.2.2. F080 management notice not produced. If an F080
                  management notice is not produced, attach a copy of the SF 361 from Cargo
                  Movement to the I306 management notice (shipped-short receipt). Send the
                  all supporting documents to Document Control. Process a tracer action
                  required transaction with action code C in position 7 to prevent the shipment
                  from appearing on the Report of Item Discrepancy Listing.
                5.2.11.3.6.4.3. Updated Shipment Status.        Process a shipment status
                transaction with updated date shipped, mode of shipment code, Transportation
                Control Number (TCN), or Government Bill of Lading (GBL), as noted by
                Cargo Movement. See Shipment Status (AS*/AU*) Input Transaction in
                AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for shipment status transaction format and
                processing instructions.
  5.2.12. Customer Backorder Review, Validation, and Cancellation.
     5.2.12.1. Purpose: To explain the customer backorder review, validation, and
     cancellation procedures. For policy specific requirements see AFI 23-101 and for IT
     specific information see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
     5.2.12.2. General Discussion: Because the accuracy of backorders in the IT system is
     important, LRS/Materiel Management Activity must coordinate with organizations to
     review and validate their backorders regularly.
     5.2.12.3. The following actions will be performed:
         5.2.12.3.1. Customer backorder review. Customers review backorders for their
         organizations to ensure they contain valid requisition numbers. Also, customers
         should ensure requisition numbers have current status, and that backorder data
         elements (i.e., priority, project code, quantity, mark-for, etc.) are correct.
         5.2.12.3.2. Customer backorder validation. Customers validate backorders for their
         organization by contacting the requestor to determine if the item is still required.
         UND A and B backorders must be validated at least monthly. UND C backorders
         must be validated at least quarterly. Note: Local management may dictate only

            5.2.12.3.4. Review of UND A and B Customer Backorders. Each day, LRS/Materiel
            Management Activity will coordinate with applicable organizations for review of
            customer backorders with UND A. At least weekly, LRS/Materiel Management
            Activity will coordinate with applicable organizations for review of customer
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  141


       backorders with UND A and B. Note: Management may determine daily processing
       is not warranted. Customers are not required to return listings received for backorder
       review. However, customers must notify LRS/Materiel Management Activity of
       items on the listings no longer needed. Notification may be via the listing, telephone,
       or other military correspondence.
       5.2.12.3.5. Validation of Customer Backorders:
          5.2.12.3.5.1. Monthly Validation of Customer Backorders. The backorder
          validation listing (M30), or equivalent, for all due-outs is produced monthly.
          UND C due-outs are required to be validated at least quarterly. Note: The
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity and maintenance organization jointly
          determine when the validation of customer backorders with the IMDS CDB
          system shall be accomplished.
          5.2.12.3.5.2. Validation of Customer Backorders. Validation of customer
          backorders for non- IMDS CDB organizations may create output images which
          can be input after the organization has completed the validation. In this case,
          these images and one copy of the validation listing are retained by the
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity. During backorder validation for IMDS
          CDB organizations, the images are forwarded to the applicable IMDS CDB
          organization.
          5.2.12.3.5.3. Validation Processing.        To validate due-outs, the supported
          organization should contact the person with the need for the backordered item to
          ensure the item is still required. It’s essential the organization validate each due-
          out on the list and cancel those which are no longer required. If there are any
          changes or cancellations required, the customer organization must contact the
          LRS\Materiel Management Activity in writing or by returning an annotated
          listing. The customer organization should provide a point of contact in case the
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity requires additional information.
       5.2.12.3.6. Validation of Base Civil Engineering (BCE) Customer Backorders. The
       M09, or equivalent, serves as the tool for validation of BCE customer backorders.
       The computer listings are distributed with a letter of transmittal to BCE Materiel
       Control Section. BCE uses the same procedures as other customers for reviewing,
       validating, requesting changes and cancellations to existing backorders. In addition,
       LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel use the M09, or equivalent, in the
       same method as the M30. LRS\Materiel Management Activity retains work copies of
       the M09 and M30, or equivalents, for the purpose of reviewing and researching
       customer backorders, including memo-obligated backorders.              If necessary,
       LRS\Materiel Management Activity personnel will requisition for support or cancel
       customer due-outs as appropriate.
       5.2.12.3.7. Validation of Bench Stock Due-outs. The monthly inventory of bench
       stocks fulfills the requirement to review and validate bench stock backorders.
       5.2.12.3.8. Backorder cancellations:
          5.2.12.3.8.1. Once a customer has determined that an item on backorder is no
          longer required, they will contact the LRS\Materiel Management Activity to have
 142                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


              the backorder cancelled.
              5.2.12.3.8.2. The LRS\Materiel Management Activity personnel will process a
              due-out cancellation as described in Customer Backorder Due-Out Cancellation
              (DOC) Transaction, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
              5.2.12.3.8.3. When necessary, the LRS\Materiel Management Activity will
              process a request for due-in cancellation for local purchase, local manufacture and
              non-MICAP part number requisitions. See Local Purchase Status Cancellation
              (LCC) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for processing instructions.
              Note: Process due-in cancellation requests as required to ensure the requisition is
              not loaded at the source of supply.

Section 5C—Physical Asset Management

5.3. Physical Asset Management.
   5.3.1. Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR).
       5.3.1.1. Purpose: To describe the procedures for submitting, following up, and replying
       to SDR. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
       guidance use AFH 23-123.
       5.3.1.2. General. SDRs will be submitted in accordance with AFJMAN 23-215 and DLM
       4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17. The SDR program is used to promote evaluation, correction, and
       improvement of logistics operations.
       5.3.1.3. Incoming SDRs. Incoming SDRs should rarely occur because bases are
       primarily receiving rather than shipping activities. Therefore, the preponderance of base
       SDR activity pertains to “outgoing” SDRs, i.e., those sent to DLA, GSA, commercial
       vendors, and occasionally to other AF bases (lateral support).
       5.3.1.4. SDR Submissions (Reporting Activity). The reporting (receiving) activity will
       submit an SDR for all item or packaging discrepancies which meet at least one of the
       conditions specified in AFJMAN 23-215 and DLM 4000.25, and Vol 2, Ch 17.
          5.3.1.4.1. LRS\Materiel Management Activity personnel will use ES-S SDR function
          or the DoD WebSDR system as the primary tools to submit SDR’s. The SF 364,
          Report of Discrepancy paper form can be used as a secondary tool until access to the
          ES-S SDR and DoD WebSDR systems are established. All requirements pertaining
          to SDRs throughout this section will be accomplished using the ES-S SDR function
          or the DoD WebSDR system. Exception: SF 364 paper form can be used for reporting
          local purchase discrepancies to the Base Contracting Office (BCO). Refer to the DLA
          Customer Assistance Handbook via the web using CAC card for further information
          concerning current POC addresses, e-mails or phone numbers.
       5.3.1.5. Discrepancies in Item Unique Identification Data (IUID) are reportable under
       shipping discrepancy criteria. Coordinate with EAE to report discrepancies involving
       IUID to ensure contractual requirements are met.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    143


     5.3.1.6. Adjustments. Completed SDRs may be used to support adjustments to the
     accountable inventory and financial accounting records of both the reporting and
     shipping activities.
     5.3.1.7. SDR Suspense File. The reporting activity will maintain a consolidated suspense
     file on all SDRs submitted. The LRS CC/AO will designate the activity responsible for
     maintaining the suspense files (if no activity is designated then Customer Support Liaison
     Element will maintain the suspense file). The activity responsible for maintaining this file
     will also accomplish all follow-up and processing actions. SDRs will remain in suspense
     until closed. An SDR is considered closed when: a reply is received, the SDR is
     categorized as unresolved, or the shipment appears on an ILS-S script providing shipment
     loss analysis. Closed SDRs will be maintained IAW AFRIMS.
        5.3.1.7.1. When a reply is received the suspense copy of the SDR may be closed.
        5.3.1.7.2. SDRs may be categorized as unresolved based on the lack of response to
        follow-ups. These SDRs will be processed as indicated in Para 5.3.1.9
        5.3.1.7.3. The Shipment Loss Analysis Report lists all shipments which were
        previously considered lost but have since been received. If a SDR was submitted for
        an item that appears on this report then the SDR should be removed from the file and
        canceled since the SDR is no longer valid.
     5.3.1.8. Processing Report of Discrepancy Listings. When discrepant receipts are
     processed in the supply system a claims receivable or claims payable detail will be
     created. ESS-SDR function automatically identifies the transactions and creates an
     internal SDR record; or, claims payable and claims receivable details that require an
     initial SDR or follow-up can be obtained by processing the ILS-S program (See Report
     Of Discrepancy List (NGV587) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for pertaining to
     accounts not managing SDRs thru ES-S). The program also produces transportation
     action required (TAR) inputs for all listed items. The listings and TAR inputs are used to
     ensure proper billing credit actions are taken.
        5.3.1.8.1. Claims Receivable Details. Claims receivable detail records are used to
        produce informational SDRs and to request billing credit. They are created and
        deleted as follows:
            5.3.1.8.1.1. Creation. A claims receivable detail is created if one of the following
            conditions exists and the dollar value involved is greater than $100 for non-
            Department of Defense (DoD) activities (Exception-greater than $25.00 for GSA)
            and greater than $100 for DoD activities:
                5.3.1.8.1.1.1. Receipt shortage. If a shortage of a funded receipt is processed
                and the dollar values above are met, then a claims receivable detail will be
                created under program control along with a received not billed detail. The
                quantity-received field will reflect the total quantity due-in, not the quantity
                received.
                5.3.1.8.1.1.2. Soon-to-be-Canceled Due-In. During follow-up processing, if a
                due-in detail is subject to valid cancellation, and a billed-not-received (BNR)
                detail exists, then a reject is created indicating the due-in cannot be cancelled
144                                                      AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             because a BNR detail exists and to submit a report of discrepancy requesting
             credit.
         5.3.1.8.1.2. Deletion. A claims receivable detail is deleted under program control
         if the credit billing is received and processed, the credit billing is denied by the
         source of supply, or Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Field Site
         deletes it.
      5.3.1.8.2. Claims Payable Details. Claims payable detail records are used to request
      billing credit. They are created and deleted as follows:
         5.3.1.8.2.1. Creation. A claims payable detail is created under program control if
         an overage of a funded shipment is processed and the overage is greater than $100
         for DoD and non-DoD activities (Exception:-greater than $25.00 for GSA).
             5.3.1.8.2.1.1. Deletion. A claims payable detail is deleted under program
             control when the proper billing adjustment input has been processed.
             5.3.1.8.2.1.2. Items on the Report of Discrepancy/Supply Discrepancy Report
             Listing (See Report Of Discrepancy List (NGV587) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
             2, Ch 6). The stock control portion of the listing shows each claims receivable
             detail which requires an SDR submission and which is a reclassified BNR
             detail. These claims receivable details have a B in the source-flag field. The
             listing and Tracer Action Request data files are produced to assist Customer
             Support in conducting follow-up.
      5.3.1.8.3. Items on the Receiving Listing. This listing shows each item which
      requires a SDR submission for its claims payable detail, claims payable receipt
      overages, and short receipt claims receivable detail. Receipt overage claims details
      will have a P (213 CLAIMS-PAYABLE-FLG) in the source-flag field. Short receipt
      claims receivable detail will have an S in the source-flag field. See DFAS-DE
      7077.10-M, Automated Materiel System Interfaced with Supply System at Base Level:
      D00 2A/GV, User’s Manual, claims receivable and received not billed record layouts
      for source-flag indicators.
      5.3.1.8.4. Initial SDR Actions on the Stock Control and Receiving Listings.
      Customer Support, stock control function will review the Receiving listing and
      identify all claims receivable details created through the processing of a shipped short
      receipt. For all such details on the listing, and for all details on the Stock Control
      listing, they will perform the following actions:
         5.3.1.8.4.1. Process SDRs. Refer to DLM 4000.25 and AFJMAN 23-215 for
         specific dollar value criteria. DoD guidance establishes a minimum reporting
         dollar value of $100, with exception to controlled material and shipments from
         contractors, manufacturers, or vendors – these are mandatory. Prepare an SDR
         for each detail exceeding $100 per line item. Claims from $100 to $499.99 may
         be pursued at the local level initially, but will forward documentation to the
         finance center or claims office for disposition if the claim cannot be settled.
         Claims above $500.00 are mandatory submissions. Process a TAR input (see
         Tracer Action Required (TAR) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5)
         with action code C. This input will update the detail 213-Billing-Request-Date or
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   145


            221-FAE-Date to show that an SDR has been submitted.
            5.3.1.8.4.2. Designate Details for Deletion. Identify shipments between DoD and
            non-DoD activities which are less than $100 per line item. DFAS Field Site will
            then automatically delete the corresponding claims receivable or payable detail
            records. Annotate the SDR listings with the deletion actions taken.
        5.3.1.8.5. Follow-up Listing. SDR follow-ups will be prepared and processed as
        specified in AFJMAN 23-215 and DLM 4000.25. To assist in the follow-up process
        a listing that shows all claims receivable and claims payable details which do not
        have follow-up SDRs submitted for them will be produced by the Report of
        Discrepancy List. The follow-up schedule is determined by subtracting the 213-
        Billing-Request- Date or 221-FAE-Date on the detail from the Julian date of the SDR
        listings as follows:
            5.3.1.8.5.1. First Follow-up. Details requiring first follow-up action are those
            which appear on the list 55 days after the initial submission of the SDRs. Once a
            first follow-up has been submitted, a detail will not appear on the list again until
            40 days after initial submission.
            5.3.1.8.5.2. Second Follow-up. Details requiring second follow-up action are
            those which appear on the list 120 days after the initial submission of the SDRs.
            Once a second follow-up has been submitted, a detail will not appear on the list
            again and the SDR will be considered unresolved.
            5.3.1.8.5.3. Update the ILS-S. When a follow-up is submitted, process a TAR
            input (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5) with an action code F to update the Billing-
            Request-Date and/or FAE-Date and show a follow-up has been submitted.
            5.3.1.8.5.4. Designate Details for Deletion. TAR monitor or Customer Support
            personnel will identify all non-classified item details appearing on the follow-up
            listing for DoD shipments valued at less than $100. These items will be
            designated for deletion. DFAS Field Site will then automatically delete the
            corresponding claims receivable/payable detail records. All classified items,
            regardless of cost, will require follow-up action.
     5.3.1.9. A SDR is defined as unresolved if its reply has not been received 146 days after
     initial submission. Allow additional mailing time for overseas bases.
        5.3.1.9.1. Forward all unresolved SDRs to the MAJCOM for assistance. If MAJCOM
        personnel do not reach a resolution for the SDR, they will request assistance from the
        AF SDR focal point.
     5.3.1.10. SDR Reply Actions.
        5.3.1.10.1. Required Replies. Action activities are required to reply to every SDR
        submitted within the time limits specified in AFJMAN 23-215 and DLM 4000.25,
        Vol 2, Ch 17. Shipping activity personnel will perform the following actions:
            5.3.1.10.1.1. Respond to the SDR indicating the appropriate disposition, e.g.,
            acknowledgement of the report, disposition of the material, validation of the
            report with authorization of financial adjustment, and/or instructions for repair or
            other type of corrective action. Identify the interim disposition/status using up to
146                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             three disposition/status (reply) codes available from the DLMS Data Element
             Dictionary/Directory.
             5.3.1.10.1.2. Complete the information on the reverse side of the SDR.
             5.3.1.10.1.3. Indicate whether a billing adjustment will be issued.
             5.3.1.10.1.4. Forward the reply to the receiving activity.
         5.3.1.10.2. Process Replies. LRS\Materiel Management Activity TAR monitor or
         Customer Support personnel will perform the following actions after receiving a reply
         to a SDR:
             5.3.1.10.2.1. Process TAR. When a reply is received, process a TAR (see Tracer
             Action Required (TAR) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) with an
             action code R to update the detail DOLT. The detail will no longer appear on the
             SDR listings, but it will remain in the computer until the proper billing adjustment
             input is processed by DFAS Field Site personnel.
             5.3.1.10.2.2. Forward Copies to the DFAS Field Site. Forward copies of all SDR
             replies to the DFAS Field Site.
         5.3.1.10.3. Interim Replies. Responsible action activities must provide an interim
         reply where a final reply cannot be provided within established timeframes. For
         additional information refer to DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17.
      5.3.1.11. Management Evaluation of the SDR Process. AFJMAN 23-215 and DLM
      4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17 directs the institution of SDR quality programs and semi-annual
      reporting of results. SDR quality programs must be sufficient to identify trends, establish
      volume and dollar values of SDRs, identify problems with shipping activities, and assist
      in preventing recurrences. Note: This does not address Security Assistance (SA) SDRs.
      Action on SA SDRs will be prescribed by SAF/IA (see Appendix G, Security Assistance
      Guidance, to AFJMAN 23-215).
         5.3.1.11.1. The LRS CC/AO will ensure detailed SDR data is maintained to analyze
         their programs. Bases must collect information on the number of SDRs submitted (by
         shipping activity), dollar value, and discrepancy type. The number of follow-ups,
         responses received, unresolved SDRs, and dollar values recovered will also be
         measured. Operations Compliance will semiannually report the effectiveness of the
         SDR program to their respective MAJCOMs.
         5.3.1.11.2. MAJCOMs will collect SDR data from their respective units on a semi-
         annual basis (reporting periods are October - March and April - September). This is
         necessary so MAJCOMs can evaluate the quality of their base SDR programs.
         MAJCOMs will ensure their units are collecting the minimum information shown in
         Para. 5.3.1.11.2.1 from all sources of shipment or supply (e.g., AFMC Air Logistics
         Complexes, GSA, DLA (including Defense Distribution Depots), other Bases, and
         any other major source of supply. MAJCOMs may prescribe additional information,
         if necessary. MAJCOMs may be asked to provide data to AF/A4LM as needed. Note:
         Data sent to AF/A4LM should only include overall trends and problems that cannot
         be resolved at MAJCOM and base levels. Defense Logistics Agency Management
         Standards Office (DLMSO) is developing requirements to enable DoD WebSDR to
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   147


          provide summary reports to facilitate the monitoring of trends, weighing the value of
          SDR dollar values, and measuring compliance with SDR timeframes.

                         Brief explanation of top two SDR problems
   5.3.2. Storage Locations (Primary, Reserve, Bin Labels, Locator Files).
      5.3.2.1. Purpose: To explain storage location procedures process. For policy specific
      requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.3.2.2. The warehouse location system allows you to pinpoint the exact location of any
      item in your warehouse inventory. Property may be maintained in fixed warehouses,
      supply points, transportable spares packages, or in maintenance activities to include in-
      use assets.
      5.3.2.3. Before assigning a warehouse location, stockroom personnel must complete the
      following at a minimum:
          5.3.2.3.1. Ensure all unnecessary labels and tags are removed from outside of box.
          5.3.2.3.2. Ensure applicable serviceability tag/labels are attached.
          5.3.2.3.3. Ensure the item is properly stored in correct warehouse (i.e. NWRM,
          classified, pilferable, ESD, etc.)
      5.3.2.4. Assigning Warehouse Locations.        Refer to Warehouse Location
      Load/Change/Delete (FCS) input transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for
      specific ILS-S information and processing.
          5.3.2.4.1. Primary Storage Locations. Warehouse personnel assign and maintain
          primary warehouse locations for each serviceable item stocked. Primary locations are
          assigned to items using the warehouse location load/change/delete input transaction.
          5.3.2.4.2. Reserve Storage Locations. The LRS CC/AO will establish controls to
          ensure reserve locations are assigned only as a last resort and that they are promptly
          deleted when no longer needed.
148                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.3.2.4.2.1. If used, warehouse personnel will cross-reference bin labels or the
         bin label/holder of both primary and reserve locations.
         5.3.2.4.2.2. Items under detail management (e.g., readiness spares package
         (RSPs), unserviceable details, in-use equipment, etc.) may contain duplicate
         storage locations; however, the storage facility must have the capability to cross-
         reference the applicable document number to maintain the audit trail and item
         accountability at all times.
      5.3.2.4.3. Processing a Warehouse Location Load/Change/Delete Request. When a
      warehouse location load/change/delete request is received, the warehouse/locator
      terminal operator updates the stock number directory before processing the
      warehouse location load/change/delete request in the ILS-S.
         5.3.2.4.3.1. Locator Files. Warehouse personnel will download electronic stock
         number directory from Discoverer Plus weekly for each geographically separated
         storeroom. All location changes will be posted on the electronic copy of the stock
         number directory. Maintain electronic copies in current status and retain until a
         new listing is produced.
         5.3.2.4.3.2. Rejects. If the warehouse location load/change/delete request input
         rejects, correct the input and reprocess it, or take the action indicated by the reject.
         If the item record is frozen for inventory, forward a copy of the reject to Inventory
         personnel. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for details on researching and
         processing rejects.
         5.3.2.4.3.3. Duplicate Locations. Once a warehouse location record has been
         assigned to an NSN, a duplicate location record will not be allowed. When a
         warehouse location record is loaded or changed and the location has already been
         assigned within a system designator, a reject notice will occur. A different
         location must be assigned or the existing record must be changed or deleted.
         5.3.2.4.3.4. Stockroom Suspense File. Develop and maintain warehouse location
         load/change/delete suspense files (within stockrooms). Suspense copies can be
         discarded once the location change is verified on the daily document register.
         5.3.2.4.3.5. Warehouse Locations for Unserviceable Details. Warehouse location
         load/change/delete inputs can also be used to load or change locations on
         unserviceable details. All location loads/changes will be maintained in suspense
         until the location is verified by its appearance on the Due-In From Maintenance
         Listing.
      5.3.2.4.4. Bin Labels. Bin labels will be attached to storage racks, bins, or bin
      subdivisions (shelf, box, drawer, etc.) in a neat and uniform manner. Bin labels for
      outside storage locations should be at strategic points in the area (such as on corner
      markers of open storage bays). Place labels for outside storage on permanent
      weatherproof placards. Bin labels are not required for unserviceable warehouse
      location changes.
         5.3.2.4.4.1. Production of Bar-Coded Bin Labels. The HHT print Temporary Bin
         Labels ES-S warehouse bin label function provides the capability to print
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     149


            temporary warehouse bin labels on portable printers attached to HHTs (see ES-S
            User’s Manual for processing instructions). The ILS-S produces all bar-coded bin
            labels. Bar-coded bin labels cannot be created manually, regardless of the number
            required
            5.3.2.4.4.2. Warehouse personnel may request new warehouse bin labels by
            preparing a warehouse location load/change/delete (FCS) input transaction, (see
            AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) or through the Print Warehouse Bin Label
            function in ES-S (see ES-S User’s Manual).
            5.3.2.4.4.3. Validation of Bin Label Data. Warehouse personnel validate all data
            on the bin labels by comparing the data on the label with the data on output
            documents or bin notices. If the data on the bin label does not match the data on
            the document and the data on the bin label is not correct, process a request for a
            replacement label.
            5.3.2.4.4.4. Active Storage Locations without Bin Labels. When warehouse
            personnel find a location with property but no bin label or an incorrect bin label,
            they must identify the proper location. Check the stock number directory or
            process an inquiry to determine the correct location for the stock number.
                5.3.2.4.4.4.1. If the warehouse location is correct and a replacement bin label
                is needed prepare a warehouse location load/change/delete (FCS) input
                transaction, (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5) or through ES-S.
                5.3.2.4.4.4.2. If the inquiry rejects because the item record is not loaded, then
                a special inventory is required. If the inquiry rejects because the item record is
                not loaded, warehouse personnel will:
                  5.3.2.4.4.4.2.1. Coordinate with Customer Support to load the item record
                  5.3.2.4.4.4.2.2. Process a warehouse location change to assign location
                  5.3.2.4.4.4.3. Process a request for special inventory. Refer to Special
                  Inventory Interrogation Input (1GP) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for
                  additional information on request for special inventory.
  5.3.3. Special Storage Handling.
     5.3.3.1. Purpose: To explain special storage handling procedures process. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.3.3.2. Hazardous commodities, controlled items, cylinders, electrostatic discharge
     (ESD) and elastomeric material are among items where alternate or additional procedures
     for storage and handling are required.
     5.3.3.3. Hazardous Commodities. AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management,
     establishes procedures and standards that govern management of hazardous materials
     (HAZMAT) throughout the AF and applies to all AF personnel who manage, authorize,
     procure, issue, use, or dispose of HAZMAT in the course of their official duties, whether
     the processes are performed by government or contractor personnel. AFI 32-7086 is
     applicable to all installations, except where joint basing or international agreements
     require modified policy.
150                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.3.3.3.1. Personnel must wear the proper safety clothing and equipment when
      handling hazardous material.
      5.3.3.3.2. Leakage or Spillage of Hazardous Commodities. Leakage or spillage of
      hazardous commodities with a health, flammability and reactivity hazards rating of 0
      or 1, proceeded by an asterisk (*); 2, 3, or 4 may be extremely dangerous to
      personnel. If leakage or spillage should occur, contact the Civil Engineering
      Squadron (CES) and Base Safety Officer before cleaning up or disposing of the
      materiel.
      5.3.3.3.3. The procedures identified in the following paragraphs apply only if the
      Hazardous Materiel Management Program identified in AFI 32-7086 has not been
      established.
         5.3.3.3.3.1. References Listing Hazardous Commodities. It is not possible to list
         all hazardous items that may be received into the Supply complex. Therefore, to
         adequately protect life and property, materiel management inspectors must be
         alert to potentially hazardous material received, stored, or issued. The following
         references provide guidance for the storage, handling, and identification of
         hazardous commodities:
             5.3.3.3.3.1.1. AFJMAN 23-209, Storage and Handling of Hazardous
             Material, provides guidance in the control, storage, and handling of hazardous
             commodities.
             5.3.3.3.3.1.2. AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air
             Force, sets forth how AF employees and activities acquire, receive, store,
             distribute, use, transfer, or dispose of any item or part that contains radioactive
             material not expressly excluded in the AFI.
             5.3.3.3.3.1.3. FED-STD 313B, Federal Standard: Material Safety Data
             Sheets (MSDS), Preparation and Submission of, contains a list of federal
             supply classes likely to contain hazardous/radioactive material.
             5.3.3.3.3.1.4. Radioactive Item Control. FED-STD 313B contains a list of
             stock groups/classes in which certain items may contain radioactive material.
             5.3.3.3.3.1.5. Warehouse Processing.        Issue documents output to the
             warehouse with the issue exception phrase statement “Health Hazard-Medical
             Certif Req'd,” will be checked against the Health Hazardous Approval List
             (HHAL). If the organization and shop code are listed as an approved user, the
             storage clerk will write or stamp on the document HHAL Approved and select
             the materiel for issue.
               5.3.3.3.3.1.5.1. If the item is not on the HHAL listing, but Customer
               Support or the customer call-in point (CCIP) has notified the storage clerk
               of the CES approval, annotate the issue document, APPROVED BY CES
               and write the name and grade of the certifying official, then issue the
               property.
               5.3.3.3.3.1.5.2. If you have not been notified of the approval by Customer
               Support or the CCIP and the item is not on the HHAL listing, call Customer
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    151


                 Support or the CCIP and ask them to contact the CES for approval. If CES
                 approval is obtained, annotate the issue document, Approved by CES and
                 write the name and grade of the certifying official, then issue the property.
                 If CES approval is not obtained, return the issue document to Customer
                 Support or the CCIP for reverse-post action.
                5.3.3.3.3.1.6. If the HHAL is Not Used. If the HHAL or ENS is not used for
                issue exception code (IEX) 9 is P (process) the LRS CC/AO and CES may
                jointly establish procedures that permit medical certification to be received on
                the phone before releasing IEX 9 items to the customer. The following action
                must be taken before issuing items that require medical certification:
                 5.3.3.3.3.1.6.1. Contact CES for certification. Write the name and grade of
                 both the certifying official and the individual requesting certification on the
                 documents before removing property from the storage location. Forward
                 copy 3 of the issue document to the CES if telephone certification is
                 authorized and obtained.
                 5.3.3.3.3.1.6.2. Not Authorized. If the CES does not authorize issue of the
                 materiel, take reverse-post action and contact the requesting organization to
                 explain why the materiel cannot be released.
     5.3.3.4. Controlled Items. AF activities will comply with guidance in DoD 4140.1-R;
     DoDM 5200.1, V3, DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified
     Information; and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management regarding the
     storage of controlled materiel.        Procedures apply to all AF activities or agencies
     managing, issuing, receiving, storing, shipping or tracking AF owned controlled materiel;
     to include civilian, contractor, Air National Guard, and AF Reserve Component units.
        5.3.3.4.1. Designation. AF activities will formally designate, in writing, personnel
        authorized to handle, or accept controlled materiel in accordance with AFI 31-401,
        AFI 20-110 and other applicable directives.
            5.3.3.4.1.1. Only personnel authorized by the Commander or equivalent are
            permitted to handle and accept controlled materiel into accountable records
            systems. Releasing activities will verify the identification of an individual and
            their authorization to accept controlled materiel prior to signing for the materiel.
            5.3.3.4.1.2. Utilize only the most current authorization list(s) of individuals
            approved to handle, and accept controlled materiel. Maintain the source lists in a
            single collection point to manage the documents. Update these lists on an annual
            basis or when changes occur.
            5.3.3.4.1.3. AF activities will store controlled materiel according to the security
            classification and/or security risk or pilferage controls of the item.
            5.3.3.4.1.4. AF activities will ensure controlled inventory items are safeguarded
            in appropriate storage facilities.
            5.3.3.4.1.5. AF activities will clearly identify the item, classification, and serial
            number (as appropriate) for all controlled materiel being stored.
152                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.3.3.4.2. AF activities will manage documentation for controlled materiel in
         accordance with disposition guidance found in AFI 31-401.
         5.3.3.4.3. AF activities will stamp or mark in red each copy of the movement
         document with the appropriate item classification phrase (i.e., classified, controlled
         cryptological item, classified NWRM, etc.) prior to the issue, receipt, return, or
         shipment of controlled materiel.
             5.3.3.4.3.1. Clearly mark NWRM transitory holding and unserviceable storage
             areas. Requirements for classified storage also apply.
             5.3.3.4.3.2. All NWRM must be segregated by condition code.
         5.3.3.4.4. AF activities will annotate the item serial number of the physical asset onto
         all accountable documents.
         5.3.3.4.5. AF activities will not requisition or transport AF owned controlled materiel
         outside of normal Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures
         (MILSTRIP). All AF activities will coordinate acquisition, utilization, and
         transportation requirements for AF owned controlled materiel with authorized
         activities.
         5.3.3.4.6. AF activities will provide training to affected personnel in regards to all
         DoD and AF policies to be followed in managing, issuing, receiving, storing,
         shipping or tracking controlled materiel. AF activities will conduct training to
         maintain awareness and competence regarding proper management of controlled
         materiel and will document all training in formal training records.
         5.3.3.4.7. AF activities will stamp or mark in red each copy of Top Secret, Secret and
         Confidential documents with the phrase "CLASSIFIED ITEM" prior to the issue,
         receipt, return, or shipment of classified material.
      5.3.3.5. Cylinders. This paragraph describes the general procedures for the control of
      government- or vendor-owned cylinders/containers.
         5.3.3.5.1. Government-Owned Cylinders. Cylinders are used to store warehouse
         stock of compressed gases. Each government-owned gas cylinder will be assigned a
         national stock number (NSN), L or P stock number.
             5.3.3.5.1.1. Tagging Cylinders' Condition. Inspection personnel indicate the
             condition of the cylinders by attaching tags or labels as specified in TO 42B5-1-2,
             Gas Cylinders (Storage Type) Use, Handling, and Maintenance.
             5.3.3.5.1.2. Exchanging Cylinders. Customers may exchange empty cylinders
             for full ones on a one-for-one basis. No transaction against the cylinder item
             record is necessary for an exchange.
             5.3.3.5.1.3. Issuing Cylinders without an Exchange. If a customer has a
             requirement for gas but does not have an empty cylinder immediately available, a
             full cylinder will be issued.
             5.3.3.5.1.4. Refilling/Repairing Empty Cylinders. Warehouse personnel ship or
             issue cylinders to vendors for refill or repair.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  153


            5.3.3.5.1.5. Customer Pre-inspection.      When mutually agreed to between
            LRS\Materiel Management Activity and the customer, the LRS CC/AO has the
            option to allow customers to pre-inspect and accept delivery of compressed gas
            cylinders at the LRS\Materiel Management Activity storage point. When this
            option is used, the customer physically inspects the cylinders for any defects and,
            if not defective, transports them from the LRS\Materiel Management Activity
            storage point to their organization site. This method reduces delays that may
            result when defective cylinders are delivered by LRS\Materiel Management
            Activity to the customer site. However, when this option is used, it is the
            responsibility of the customer to return empty cylinders to the supply storage
            point.
        5.3.3.5.2. Controlling Vendor-Owned Cylinders or Containers. When issuing
        vendor-owned cylinders or containers, Central Storage personnel will prepare AF
        Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt. The AF Form 1297 will be signed by the
        organization receiving the contents of the cylinders or containers. Central Storage
        will maintain the signed form in a suspense file until the cylinders or containers have
        been returned to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. Warehouse personnel will
        prepare and process updates to vendor-owned container detail records (See Vendor
        Owned Container Detail Record Update – 1VR in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5)
        upon issue of filled containers and when empty containers are returned.
     5.3.3.6. Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). Inspection will ensure ESD items are properly
     marked/labeled and a type cargo code (TCC) 3 is stored on the item record. When
     physical inspection indicates ESD marking/labeling with TCC other than 3, handle the
     item as ESD sensitive and submit a message or letter to the Transportation Manager at
     the Air Logistics Complex (ALC) managing that particular item. To inquire if an item is
     truly TCC 3, send all requests to Robins AFB Type Cargo Code Challenges.
        5.3.3.6.1. Serviceability Checks. When the serviceability of an ESD item is
        questionable, inspection personnel will issue the item to maintenance for a functional
        check. Never use staples or any kind of metal fasteners to attach documentation to
        ESD property.
     5.3.3.7. Elastomeric Materiel. Elastomeric items will be managed using first-in/first-out
     (FIFO) procedures. For example, materiel with a use by date of 1 Jan 2012 should be
     placed in front, on top, etc., of items with a use by date of 1 May 2013. When issuing
     property, select the items with the closest use by date first. If materiel does not have a
     use by date, then select the items with the oldest date received stamped/printed on the
     package/container. Exception: Issue the newest item to fill RSP kits.
     5.3.3.8. Controlled Inventory Items Codes (CIIC) as Highest Sensitivity (Category I) –
     Arms, Ammunition and Explosives with a physical security classification of Secret (CIIC
     5), High Sensitivity (Category II) – Arms, Ammunition and Explosives. (CIIC 6), and
     High Sensitivity (Category II) – Arms, Ammunition and Explosives with a physical
     security classification of Confidential (CIIC 8) will be stored and transported in
     accordance with the provisions of AFI 31-401, DoDM 5100.76, Physical Security of
     Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives (AA&E) or DoDM 5100.76,
     V3 whichever is more stringent.
154                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.3.3.9. Small Arms weapon components, such as silencers, mufflers and noise
      suppression devices will be treated as Category II items. (Reference: DoDM 5100.76,
      V3).
      5.3.3.10. Small Arms major subparts, such as frame(s) and receiver(s), will be treated as
      Category II items. (Reference: DoDM 5100.76).
      5.3.3.11. Barrels and Major Subassemblies will be protected as Category IV Arms.
      (Reference: DoDM 5100.76).
      5.3.3.12. Generally, only arms, rockets, explosive rounds, mines and projectiles that have
      an unpackaged weight of 100 pounds or less shall be categorized as sensitive. (Reference:
      DoDM 5100.76).
      5.3.3.13. The following is a list of sensitive items that require a high degree of protection
      and physical inventory control. The DoD components are expected to include additional
      items determined to require a similar degree of control:
         5.3.3.13.1. Drug abuse items.
         5.3.3.13.2. Precious metals.
         5.3.3.13.3. Hazardous items.

            artillery rounds, bombs, and torpedoes) which have potential use in civil
            disturbances and are vulnerable to theft.
  5.3.4. Warehouse Storage Location Validation.
     5.3.4.1. Purpose: To explain warehouse storage location validation procedures. For
     policy specific requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
     AFH 23-123.
     5.3.4.2. The accurate storage and control of assets is essential to inventory control and
     accuracy. Warehouse location validations are conducted to: 1) verify the asset is stored
     in the warehouse location stated on item record 2) ensure all records indicating a
     serviceable balance are assigned a warehouse location, and 3) identify those records
     having duplicate warehouse locations.
     5.3.4.3. Warehouse Validation Schedule. Warehouse personnel are required to prepare a
     warehouse location validation schedule each fiscal year to ensure all assigned locations
     are validated annually.     Note: Do NOT count balances when conducting annual
     validations.
         5.3.4.3.1. Scheduling Warehouse Location Validations. The validation program is
         scheduled and performed based on the location of items in the warehouse (warehouse
         location sequence). Additional validation selections are provided to fulfill the
         requirements of local management (example classified, sensitive, pilferable).
         However, these additional selections do not satisfy the normal requirements for
         validation.
         5.3.4.3.2. Coordination of Activities. The LRS CC/AO will ensure Inventory Section
         and warehouse personnel coordinate closely during the preparation of the warehouse
         location validation and inventory schedules. The storage activity will complete
         scheduled validations within 10 workdays prior to the start of a cycle inventory.
         5.3.4.3.3. Copies of the Location Validation Schedule. The NCOIC of the Central
         Storage Element will provide copies of the warehouse location validation schedule to
156                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         the appropriate stock rooms, Inventory section, and any other section/element as
         required locally. All recipients of the warehouse location validation schedule will
         retain it until replaced by or superseded with a new schedule.
         5.3.4.3.4. Satellite Accounts. The warehouse location validation for satellite
         accounts is scheduled and conducted by warehouse personnel responsible for their
         respective satellite accounts.
      5.3.4.4. Validation File Listing. ES-S Warehouse Management, Location Validation
      function is the primary IT tool for validations. One day before the start of the validation,
      warehouse personnel will request the warehouse validation listing using applicable IT
      system. Refer to ES-S User’s Manual for the parameter format. The Warehouse Location
      Validation program writes images to a location-validation database and prints the images
      on the Validation File Listing in warehouse location sequence.
      5.3.4.5. Warehouse Location Validation Processing. Warehouse personnel compare the
      stock number displayed on the bin label with the stock number on the property tag of the
      item in the bin location. Note: Warehouse personnel will open all containers for
      controlled materiel (NWRM, classified, sensitive, and pilferable) and physically verify
      that the item matches the stock number on the property tag and bin label. Materiel in a
      location must be identified/tagged. Refer to AFI 23-101 for specific marking/tagging
      guidance.
      5.3.4.6. Processing Warehouse Location Validation Discrepancies.
         5.3.4.6.1. Stock number on property does not match stock number listed on the bin
         label. Warehouse personnel will take the following actions:
             5.3.4.6.1.1. Process a stock number inquiry in the applicable IT system to
             determine if location exists and was accidently put in the wrong location. Note:
             If applicable IT systems are unavailable you can research using the Stock Number
             User Directory (SNUD), warehouse location change suspense files, or the Daily
             Document Register.
                 5.3.4.6.1.1.1. If warehouse location is assigned, then move to correct location.
                 5.3.4.6.1.1.2. If warehouse location is not assigned, process a warehouse
                 location change (FCS) to assign one. Refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5
                 for processing instructions.
                 5.3.4.6.1.1.3. If the inquiry indicates a zero (0) balance, prepare a request for
                 special inventory. Enter the location of the property on the request, and then
                 forward it to the Inventory Section, see Special Inventory Interrogation Input
                 (1GP) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the format.
                 5.3.4.6.1.1.4. If the inquiry rejects because the item record is not loaded,
                 warehouse personnel will get with Customer Support to load the item record,
                 then process a warehouse location change to assign location, and finally
                 process a request for special inventory.
      5.3.4.7. Stock in bin/location for which no warehouse location has been assigned.
      Warehouse personnel first check the warehouse location change suspense file and the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   157


     “Serviceable Balance - No Location” Listing to see if a warehouse location is being
     loaded.
        5.3.4.7.1. If a location is being loaded, prepare a slip to indicate the bin has been
        validated.
        5.3.4.7.2. If the locator file indicates another location, move the stock to the proper
        location.
        5.3.4.7.3. If you cannot resolve the problem using either of the methods above, then
        prepare a request for special inventory. Annotate the location on the inventory
        request, and place a copy in the bin.
     5.3.4.8. Zero Balance/Zero Demand Level Listing. A listing of locations assigned to
     item records with a zero (0) serviceable balance, a zero (0) demand level, and date of last
     transaction (DOLT) equal to or greater than 30 days, will be requested using the
     appropriate option. Note: Program control will not select “dead” locations with the
     above conditions when any of the following detail records are linked to the item record:
     Due-in detail, due-in from maintenance detail, due-in from maintenance (DIFM)
     unserviceable detail, supply point detail, war reserve materiel (WRM)/ in place readiness
     spares package (IRSP) spares detail, and WRM/war consumables distribution objective
     (WCDO) spares detail. Warehouse personnel will physically verify each location
     identified on the list to ensure the location is empty.
        5.3.4.8.1. If the location is empty, warehouse personnel may delete the location. See
        Warehouse Location Load/Change/Delete (FCS) input transaction in AFH 23-123,
        Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing. Remove the bin
        label from the location after the location has been deleted.
        5.3.4.8.2. If any stock remains in the bin, process a request for special inventory and
        forward it to Inventory.
     5.3.4.9. Serviceable Balances with No Warehouse Location.           ES-S Warehouse
     Management, Location Validation function is the primary IT tool for managing
     serviceable balances with no location. See the ES-S User’s Manual or refer to for the
     Serviceable Balance No Location Listing. This listing is used to identify items having
     serviceable balance but no warehouse location and a date of last transaction (DOLT)
     greater than 3 days.
        5.3.4.9.1. Warehouse personnel will request this listing daily to ensure items that
        appear on the listing are being worked in a timely manner. Items will not appear on
        the listing for no more than 5 duty days unless under special circumstances.
  5.3.5. Warehouse Change Documents.
     5.3.5.1. Purpose: To explain warehouse change document procedures process. For
     policy specific requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
     AFH 23-123.
     5.3.5.2. Certain ILS-S transactions will automatically cause the generation of warehouse
     change documents. These transactions are item record indicative data changes, unit of
     issue changes, and controlled item code changes.
158                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.3.5.3. Processing Warehouse Change Documents. Transactions that will cause the
      automatic generation of a warehouse change document are:
         5.3.5.3.1. Item Record Indicative Data Changes. When an item record indicative
         data change input changes a stock number, system designator, or ERRCD. Note: A
         warehouse change document will NOT be produced when the FIC input changes only
         the last two positions of the national stock number (positions 14-15). It is, therefore,
         NOT necessary to keep positions 14-15 of the national stock number current on
         external tags, bin labels, etc. The 13-digit national stock number is the basis for ILS-S
         transactions on these items.
         5.3.5.3.2. Unit of Issue Changes. Refer to Warehouse Change Document in AFH 23-
         123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for the output format.
         5.3.5.3.3. Controlled Item Code Changes. Refer to Warehouse Change Document in
         AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for the output format.
      5.3.5.4. Receipt of Warehouse Change Documents. Warehouse personnel must process
      warehouse change documents as quickly as possible. Upon receipt of warehouse change
      documents, warehouse personnel will do the following:
         5.3.5.4.1. Update Labels, Tags, and Listings. Change the applicable data on bin
         labels, property tags, locator listing (Stock Number Directory), etc.
            5.3.5.4.1.1. Shelf Life and Issue Exception Code Changes. The ILS-S program
            control prints the shelf life code and issue exception code. When applicable,
            warehouse personnel will use this data to update external files.
            5.3.5.4.1.2. Zero Balance Procedures. When a unit of issue change results in a
            zero balance because there is an insufficient quantity on hand to show a balance,
            warehouse personnel must get Customer Support to help resolve the problem. For
            example, if the item is critical or in short supply locally, local management must
            decide if adjunct (-1) records should be loaded.
         5.3.5.4.2. Relocate Property.    Relocation may be necessary when the following
         occur:
            5.3.5.4.2.1. Changed Controlled Item Code. The Materiel Management Flight
            Commander or Superintendent must approve any relocation of the property
            caused by controlled item code changes by signing the warehouse change
            document. When changing from classified to unclassified, warehouse personnel
            must verify the change to the controlled item code originated through the stock
            number user directory (SNUD). If the change did not originate through SNUD,
            warehouse personnel process a controlled item code change input to reinstate the
            previous controlled item code stated on the warehouse change document. If the
            change was received through SNUD, it should be valid. However, if the Materiel
            Management Flight Commander or Superintendent believes the change
            compromises security, warehouse personnel immediately ask Customer Support
            to validate the controlled item codes. In the meantime, the property remains in
            secure storage.
            5.3.5.4.2.2. Consolidating Stock Numbers/Unit of Issue. When warehouse change
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   159


            documents require consolidation due to stock number merge or unit of issue
            conversions. Ensure material correctly matches quantity and stock number
            changes.
        5.3.5.4.3. Coordinate with Inspection. Coordinate with Inspection when property
        requires inspection.

              5.3.6.3.17.2.1. PAS codes will be loaded with the following headings:
166                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                5.3.6.3.17.2.2. Base Code: wing (ex: 52 FW).
                5.3.6.3.17.2.3. UIC/SRAN: populate (ex: FB5621).
                5.3.6.3.17.2.4. Base Name: spell out (ex: 52nd Fighter Wing).
            5.3.6.3.17.3. Line item authorizations must be loaded in accordance with tariff
            sized authorizations and single unit items (ex: BOI of 4: 1000 C Bags = 4000
            canister authorizations) within the nomenclature table in the mobility IT system.
            Refer to the mobility IT system user’s guide for load procedures.
         5.3.6.3.18. IPE Element personnel must take corrective action on all the mobility IT
         system errors. This will foster accurate accountability. Errors, cause and corrective
         action are listed below.
            5.3.6.3.18.1. Error or Warning received after processing roll up file:
                5.3.6.3.18.1.1. ERROR: NSN Not found in Nomenclature List. Cause: NSN
                is loaded in a base system that is not in the AF master File. Corrective
                Action: Request for loading of new NSN/Nomenclatures through your
                MAJCOM POC to the PMO office for approval and loading in the master file.
                If the request is denied, remove all assets loaded against the
                NSN/Nomenclature and remove NSN/Nomenclature from the unit’s mobility
                IT system.
                5.3.6.3.18.1.2. WARNING: Contract/Lot Not defined for NSN. Possible
                Cause: Typo when entering Contract/Lot; new contract/lot entering the AF
                inventory. Corrective Action: Validate the contract/lot on the property to the
                error received. If the item is new to the AF inventory, forward the information
                through your MAJCOM POC to the PMO office. If there is an error, take
                corrective action in the mobility IT system.
                5.3.6.3.18.2.1. Errors received after processing contract/lot update file.
                  5.3.6.3.18.2.1.1. ERROR: Not received via Internet Update. Cause: The
                  Contract/Lot combination is loaded in the base mobility IT system and not
                  in the AF master file. Corrective Action: Forward Contract/Lot information
                  to the PMO office to be added to the master file.
                5.3.6.3.18.2.2. ERROR: ## entries in STOCK but not in Contract/Lot List.
                Cause: Contract/Lot is in error and not in the base mobility IT system or in the
                AF master file. Corrective Action: ## entries are the number of lines not
                quantity that need to be. Validate the Contract/Lot on the property to the error
                received. If the Contract/Lot is valid, forward the information to the PMO
                office. If there is an error, take corrective action in the mobility IT system.
         5.3.6.3.19. All IPE personnel will complete computer based training (CBT) modules
         located at the Mobility CoP referenced above. Training must be documented.
  5.3.7. Supply Point Management.
      5.3.7.1. Purpose: To explain supply point unique management procedures. For policy
      specific requirements, review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance AFH 23-123.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  167


     5.3.7.2. Supply Points are additional warehouses located within or next to the supported
     activities.
     5.3.7.3. Supply Point Establishment/Change Requests.
        5.3.7.3.1. Organizations desiring to establish and/or change a supply point must
        submit a list of requested items to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity, Flight
        Service Center (FSC) element. This list shall include the following item information:
        stock number, part number, nomenclature, end item application (i.e., weapon system,
        end item, or equipment), quantity desired, and identify if functional check is required
        for the assets. The following items are authorized on a supply point:
            5.3.7.3.1.1. Any item of supply, except for equipment items (ERRCD ND*/NF*)
            and items assigned Numeric Parts Preference Codes (NPPC) 4 or 9.
            5.3.7.3.1.2. Buildup items. The individual XD*/XF* components of buildup
            items will be identified and accounted for separately on supply point detail
            records. Expendable items (XB3) required for a buildup item do not need to be
            accounted for separately. Expendable items can be obtained by submitting
            normal issue requests.
            5.3.7.3.1.3. Launch kits.
        5.3.7.3.2. Once an item is selected for addition, all authorized interchangeable
        (substitute) items must also be stocked in the supply point.
        5.3.7.3.3. Upon receipt of the supply point establishment/change request, the FSC
        will:
            5.3.7.3.3.1. Verify only authorized items have been requested (reference Para’s
            5.3.7.3.1.1 - 5.3.7.3.1.3 above).
            5.3.7.3.3.2. Determine authorized quantity amounts. The quantity of an item
            stocked in a supply point is based upon the demand data of the organizations
            using the supply point (except for XB3 items). Items used by more than one
            organization can be stocked in a supply point; however, care must be taken to
            ensure all base users are adequately supported.
                5.3.7.3.3.2.1. Sole Users. When only one organization uses the item, the total
                authorization of the base’s operating stock may be kept at the supply point
                (when space allows). In this case, supply point personnel will receive, store,
                and issue property in the same manner as central storage personnel.
                5.3.7.3.3.2.2. Multiple Users. When there is more than one user of the item,
                only a portion of the base’s operating stock will be stored in the supply point
                for each supported organization. In this case, the balance maintained in each
                supply point will be recorded on a supply point detail for each organization.
            5.3.7.3.3.3. Verify supply point requests are supported by positive Requisitioning
            Objectives (RO). This can be accomplished by processing individual item record
            inquiries or a Discoverer script to ascertain base asset position. If RO is
            insufficient to support supply point request, the FSC direct the customer to
            prepare and submit an ASL. Failure to submit the ASL could delay supply point
168                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             support. See Para 2.2.5 for ASL request submission instructions. Non-Airborne
             Communications-Electronics (C-E) XD* items (to include space, weather and
             missile system assets) do not require the documented request for a special level.
             See Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure for procedures on establishing Low Density
             Levels for C-E XD* items.
             5.3.7.3.3.4. Forward supply point requests which include Economic Order
             Quantity (EOQ) items (ERRCD XB3) to the Materiel Management Flight
             Commander for approval.
             5.3.7.3.3.5. For all new supply point establishment requests, coordinate addition
             of a new delivery destination record with the Customer Support Liaison Element.
             Shop codes for all supply point activities must have a corresponding delivery
             destination record loaded to ensure correct delivery. For supply point activities
             not located on the supporting base or satellite, the off-base indicator must be used
             when loading a delivery destination. When this indicator is used, the ILS-S
             produces a transportation copy of issue or release document. The off-base
             indicator will be blank for those activities serviced by the supporting base or
             satellite Pickup and Delivery. See Delivery Destination Record Load, Change, Or
             Delete (1DE) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for delivery destination input
             format and processing procedures.
             5.3.7.3.3.6. Add/change/delete Supply Point Detail Records. Assets maintained
             in supply points will be accounted for and controlled on supply point detail
             records. See Supply Point Detail Load/Change/Delete/Inquiry (FSP) in AFH 23-
             123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing.
             5.3.7.3.3.7. Submit requests to produce the Supply Point Listing and bin labels.
             See Supply Point Listing (Q13/NGV875) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for
             specific ILS-S information and processing instructions. For specific information
             on bin labels, refer to the ES-S User’s Manual. Provide a copy of the listing and
             bin labels to the supply point monitor. Maintain one copy of the Supply Point
             Listing in the FSC.
      5.3.7.4. Asset Accountability. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity maintains
      accountability of assets in supply points in the appropriate ILS-S.
         5.3.7.4.1. The supported organization’s supply point monitor is responsible for the
         overall management and control for those supply point within their possession, to
         include: assist LRS\Materiel Management Activity personnel during scheduled
         inventories, maintain supply discipline when ordering assets from the supply point,
         ensuring assets in supply points are serviceable inventories, and provide secure space
         and facilities to store supply point assets.
      5.3.7.5. Stocking and Replenishing Supply Points.
         5.3.7.5.1. Issues (Transfers) to Supply Points. The issue of stock to a Supply Point is
         merely a transfer of stock from one warehouse location to another. No usage or
         demand data will be updated. When Supply Points are established and/or changed,
         the issue interface can be used to automatically request transfers of stock to the
         Supply Point. Standard issue (transfer) procedures outlined in Customer Issue
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                169


        Request (ISU/MSI) Transaction Mark-For Field Data Requirements in AFH 23-123,
        Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 will be used to replenish supply points.
        5.3.7.5.2. Issues From Supply Points. All issues from a supply point are over-the-
        counter. When a demand is placed on the supply point and the item is available,
        supply point personnel will select the item from the location and prepare an MSI
        request. If ILS-S access is available at the supply point, the MSI document will be
        returned to the input terminal so the recipient's signature can be obtained. supply
        points operating without an ILS-S terminal (or with an inoperable terminal) will
        prepare MSI requests as degraded operations. The supply point monitor will forward
        all documentation to the FSC for processing and to ensure proper document control
        actions are taken. See Issue From Detail Record (MSI) Processing Instructions and
        Transaction Format in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for detailed supply point
        processing and documentation preparation.
        5.3.7.5.3. Turn Around Processing In Lieu of Issue Requests. Turn around
        procedures may be used in lieu of processing issue requests to record demand data for
        fast moving items in supply points. When turnaround procedures are used, the supply
        point detail Date Of Last Transaction (DOLT) is not updated. See Maintenance
        Turnaround Processing in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 4 for turnaround processing
        and T.O. 00-20-3, Maintenance Processing of Reparable Property and the Repair
        Cycle Asset Control System for additional information, for additional information.
     5.3.7.6. Transfers of Items between Supply Points. One supply point may issue items to
     another. First, a return (TRIC TIN with TEX code 8) from the losing supply point must
     be processed to prevent due-outs from being released. See Recoverable Item Turn-In
     Request (TIN) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 for return processing. Secondly, a
     forced due-out release (TRIC DOR with TEX code 3) will be processed with the gaining
     supply point’s due-out. See Forced Due-Out Release (DOR) Input Transaction in AFH
     23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
     5.3.7.7. Returns to a Supply Point from Maintenance. Returns (TRIC TIN) to a supply
     point from maintenance will be completed, see Recoverable Item Turn-In Request (TIN)
     as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6. Supply points will only accept returns
     when the property is serviceable and required to satisfy existing due-outs.
     5.3.7.8. Supply Point Reconciliation.
        5.3.7.8.1. Semiannual reconciliations of all supply points are mandatory. More
        frequent reconciliations are recommended when warranted by the volume of changes.
        One of the semiannual reconciliations will be accomplished at the same time as the
        annual supply point inventory. See Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and Inventory
        Adjustments for more information on inventorying supply points. Reference AFI
        21-101 for additional information.
        5.3.7.8.2. A Supply Point Listing will be used to perform the reconciliation. See
        Supply Point Listing (Q13/NGV875), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. The supported
        supply monitor(s) will perform a physical count to verify the balances. All items and
        requirements on the listing will be verified, to include:
            5.3.7.8.2.1. Balance Discrepancies. When the physical on-hand balance does not
170                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             match the quantities on the Supply Point Listing, discrepancies will be reconciled
             according to the inventory procedures in Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and
             Inventory Adjustments.
             5.3.7.8.2.2. Verified Excesses. The supply point monitor will complete an AF
             Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, and return verified excesses to the FSC.
             5.3.7.8.2.3. Items Less than the Authorization. When the reconciliation shows
             the total items are less than the authorization plus due-outs, the FSC will verify
             the RO is still sufficient to support the supply point’s authorized quantity. If RO
             is sufficient, FSC will process issue requests to establish due-outs or create issue
             release. The FSC may use the issue transactions produced by the Supply Point
             Listing or manually process issues. If RO is not sufficient to support authorized
             quantity, procedures in Para 5.3.7.3.3.3 will be followed; or assets will be
             returned to FSC and supply detail reduced for discrepant quantity.
      5.3.7.9. Operating Supply Points with Buildup Items.
         5.3.7.9.1. Transaction Notification. Each time a buildup item (or components) is
         removed from the supply point to replace a like item (removed from an end item), the
         organization responsible for the supply point items will notify the LRS/Materiel
         Management Activity of the transaction. An issue from the supply point or a
         turnaround will be processed for each component. When issue procedures are used,
         demand code R or N will be used to establish DIFM accountability.
         5.3.7.9.2. Clear the DIFM. After the item is restored (repaired and built up) by
         Maintenance, the asset will be placed back in the supply point’s stock and a
         paperwork return (TRIC TIN) for each component will be processed to clear the
         outstanding DIFM details.
             5.3.7.9.2.1. After the return is processed, a paperwork transfer to the supply point
             will be processed to reduce the serviceable on-hand balance and restore the supply
             point on-hand balance.
             5.3.7.9.2.2. If the item is returned to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity for
             Not Reparable This Station (NRTS)/condemned action, normal DIFM return
             procedures will apply. See Ch 4 and 6 for more information.
         5.3.7.9.3. MICAP Requirements for Buildup Items. Supply points will release
         buildup items to satisfy the MICAP requirement of another activity when no other
         items are available to satisfy the redistribution order and AFMC directs the shipment.
         Maintenance personnel will ensure the item is broken down (into separate
         components) prior to release.
         5.3.7.9.4. LRS-Operated Buildup Supply Points.              When the LRS/Materiel
         Management Activity manages the buildup supply point (instead of Maintenance),
         short term (10 days or less) hand receipts will be used to control the items while they
         are physically in Maintenance undergoing buildup. LRS/Materiel Management
         Activity will coordinate with Maintenance to minimize the amount of time an item is
         in buildup. When hand receipts are in excess of 10 days, conduct a daily revalidation
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     171


        with Maintenance until they are cleared. Do not use DIFM procedures to control the
        items during buildup because they will cause erroneous ILS-S reporting.
  5.3.8. Selecting Assets for Issue, Shipment, or Transfer (Normal, Warehouse Refusal,
  Zero Balance Validation).
     5.3.8.1. Purpose: To explain how to select assets for an issue, shipment, or transfer. For
     policy specific requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
     AFH 23-123.
     5.3.8.2. When a request will be satisfied by assets that are in stock, a movement
     document will be produced. Warehouse personnel will take immediate action to move
     the assets from stock for delivery to the customer or cargo movement.
     5.3.8.3. After receiving documentation, take the following steps to ensure that you are
     selecting the right property:
        5.3.8.3.1. Go to the location indicated on the document.
        5.3.8.3.2. Ensure the bin label matches the information on the issue document.
            5.3.8.3.2.1. Ensure that the stock number and unit of issue on the property
            tag/label are correct.
            5.3.8.3.2.2. Ensure proper stock rotation, in other words select the oldest dated
            item in location.
        5.3.8.3.3. Select the quantity indicated on the document.
        5.3.8.3.4. Ensure issue exception processing is accomplished when applicable. For
        example, random length (IEX code 4 – sheet metal, tubing, fabric, etc.) sometimes
        requires quantities to be issued in one continuous length.
        5.3.8.3.5. Check document to determine if location requires zero balance verification.
        This occurs when the quantity on the item record is reduced to zero after pulling the
        quantity that is listed on the document.
        5.3.8.3.6. Sign and date the issue document to show that you pulled the property.
        5.3.8.3.7. Move the property and document for delivery to the customer.
     5.3.8.4. Asset Selection Problems. The two most common problems that may occur
     when assets are being selected from stock are: 1) the warehouse location stated on a
     document is either empty or does not contain sufficient assets to fill the request; 2)
     documents indicate the on-hand balance was reduced to zero but assets remain in stock.
        5.3.8.4.1. Warehouse Refusals. A warehouse refusal occurs when the warehouse
        location stated on an issue or shipment document is either empty or does not contain
        enough quantity to fill the request. In this situation, take the following steps to ensure
        the item is not misplaced in the warehouse:
            5.3.8.4.1.1. Fill the request from a reserve location (if applicable).
            5.3.8.4.1.2. Check adjacent locations to see if the item might have fallen into the
            adjacent location or was stored in the wrong location.
            5.3.8.4.1.3. Check the same and adjacent locations in the bin rows on each side of
172                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             the one stated on the issue/shipment document.
             5.3.8.4.1.4. Check the locator listing and FCS suspense file for a possible
             warehouse location change.
             5.3.8.4.1.5. Process a CTH inquiry to check for recent transactions (i.e. receipts,
             returns, location changes). Check with Receiving, Inspection, and the Flight
             Service Center to determine the availability of the property.
             5.3.8.4.1.6. If the assets are still not found, notify the warehouse or stockroom
             supervisor. Supervisors will take action to verify the item is missing by repeating
             all of the above procedures. If the assets are still not found the warehouse or
             stockroom supervisor will:
                5.3.8.4.1.6.1. Stamp all copies of the document WAREHOUSE REFUSAL
                (using 1/2 inch block letters and red ink), sign copy 1 across the stamp, and
                write ASSIGN TEX CODE P beneath the stamp on the first copy.
                5.3.8.4.1.6.2. Prepare and input a special inventory request to load freeze
                code I to the item record. See Special Inventory Interrogation Input (1GP),
                AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for format. Forward all copies of the refused
                document along with special inventory output notice to the inventory control
                function.
                5.3.8.4.1.6.3. If the issue is for a repair cycle item, prepare and process a due-
                in from maintenance (DIFM) detail change input to load status “RFS” to the
                DIFM detail. Refer to Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) Updates in AFH
                23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 4 for processing instructions.
                5.3.8.4.1.6.4. Notify Customer Support of all warehouse-refused documents.
                Note: Customer Support will notify AFMC SCM-R Stock control if
                warehouse refusal is for a shipment or Redistribution Order.
         5.3.8.4.2. Zero Balance Validation. To facilitate zero balance validation, the supply
         system automatically identifies documents or transactions (ISU, BSU, DOR, SHP,
         and A5J) that reduce the item record serviceable balance to zero. The phrase SER
         BAL = 0 will be printed in either block W or block F on physical documents. Bench
         stock issues (TRIC BSU) that reduce the item record serviceable balance to zero are
         identified by a numeric zero in position 80. The individual validating the zero
         balance will initial next to the zero balance phrase to indicate the check has been
         accomplished. Note: ES-S/AM processing stores user information on transaction
         histories, a physical document is not required.
             5.3.8.4.2.1. If stock remains, request a special inventory for the warehouse
             location indicated on transaction. See Special Inventory Interrogation Input
             (1GP), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for inventory request format.
  5.3.9. Directed and Non Directed Shipments.
      5.3.9.1. Purpose: To explain base-initiated, non-directed shipment (SHP) procedures.
      For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
      AFH 23-123.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    173


     5.3.9.2. General: AF bases can initiate shipments of supply (ERRCD XB3, XF3, and
     XD*) and equipment (NF*/ND*) items when required. Base-initiated shipments can also
     be used to ship assets when the application of “special shipment procedures” is required.
     One common use of base-initiated shipments is base-to-base lateral support. (Note bases
     are not authorized to initiate asset shipments to non-AF activities (such as other Services,
     DLA, or GSA). Bases are not authorized to return serviceable AF managed assets back
     to Air Logistics Complex’s using transaction SHP, bases should receive redistribution
     orders (A2*) from the item manager. One common use of base-initiated shipments is
     base-to-base lateral support. Base-initiated shipments can also be used to ship assets
     when the application of “special shipment procedures” is required. Bases will perform
     physical bare item inspection of property (identaplate, engraving, decal, or label) to
     ensure: proper identification of asset IAW MIL-STD-129, Military Marking for Shipment
     and Storage; and that materiel shipped matches supporting documentation AFTO Form
     350, Reparable Item Tag and ILS-S records.
        5.3.9.2.1. Lateral requisition procedures allow for an ILS-S account to requisition
        either stock replenishment and/or due-out requirements from another ILS-S account
        provided there is a mutual agreement between the Supply activities. This form of
        support can be for selected items or a full range of items. See AFI 23-101, Sec. 2B,
        Stockage Policy for detailed information about lateral support policy for CONUS and
        OCONUS bases.
            5.3.9.2.1.1. Note: Lateral support shipments are subject to the asset release rules
            detailed in Lateral Support Requisitioning Procedures, High priority lateral
            support in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 and ES-S User’s Manual. AFH 23-123,
            Vol 2, Pt 4, Ch 6 provides details which supports both manual sourcing
            (a.k.a.,“GET IT”) and automatic sourcing tools.
            5.3.9.2.1.2. The activity required to pay for lateral support transportation charges
            are dependent on whether the asset being shipped is included within the Defense
            Working Capital Fund (DWCF), or not and whether the asset is an Item Manager
            directed shipment or not. Details are provided in AFI 65-601 Vol 1, Budget
            Guidance and Procedures.
            5.3.9.2.1.3. Processing a lateral support non-directed shipment (SHP) transaction
            causes the ILS-S to output a DD 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt. Base logistics
            personnel use the output release/receipt document to pick (from the supply
            warehouse location) and ship the redistributed asset. AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch
            2, provides Nondirected Shipment (SHP) Output Format - DD 1348-1A.
            5.3.9.2.1.4. A lateral shipment may be picked up by an individual (as in the case
            of neighboring bases) rather than being moved through normal transportation
            channels. However, release the property only to individuals identified by losing
            and gaining bases when coordinated by AFMC SCM-R MICAP/Stock Control
            Activity (Excluding local manufacture and local purchase items). This procedure
            is required to prevent release of property to unauthorized individuals
        5.3.9.2.2. Status for base-initiated shipments is programmatically passed to the base
        receiving the redistributed asset by the ILS-S via supply status (AE*) transactions.
        Additionally, the ILS-S at the receiving base programmatically initiates follow-up
174                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         action with the shipping base via MILSTRIP follow-up transactions. Refer to Sec.
         5B, Order and Requisitioning for additional information about supply status (AE*)
         and MILSTRIP follow-up (AFC) transactions.
      5.3.9.3. The ES-S Manage Outbound Shipment process provides enhanced capabilities
      for managing movements from initial shipment through Cargo Movement until the
      receipt is processed at the gaining base. This capability focuses on ensuring outbound
      shipments are planned, packaged and executed by Cargo Movement personnel within the
      standard timeframes defined for the current Delinquent Shipment Listing (R40) process,
      and that base shipments arrive at the proper destination in the correct quantity. Refer to
      ES-S User’s Manual for more information.
      5.3.9.4. There are a number of circumstances where special procedures must be used to
      generate base shipments.
         5.3.9.4.1. For Non-Reimbursable Shipments.
             5.3.9.4.1.1. Use of Advice Code and FREE SHPMNT Phrase. Stock Control
             inputs advice code 2E if Funds Management has approved a request for non-
             reimbursable shipment. When code 2E is input, the phrase FREE SHPMNT will
             appear on the output DD Form 1348-1A shipping document.
             5.3.9.4.1.2. When a request is received for a non-reimbursable shipment, AFMC
             SCM-R Stock Control Activity forwards the correspondence to AFMC SCM-R
             Funds Management Activity. AFMC SCM-R Funds Management Activity will
             then take the following actions:
                 5.3.9.4.1.2.1. Approve or disapprove the request.
                 5.3.9.4.1.2.2. File a copy of the request in suspense. The AFMC SCM-R
                 Funds Management Activity reviews this copy against the daily Free Issue
                 and Credit Code Y Turn-Ins Listing, Base Supply Surveillance Report
                 D20/NGV821).
                 5.3.9.4.1.2.3. If the shipment is for a vendor-owned container, no further
                 action is required.
                 5.3.9.4.1.2.4. If the shipment was previously approved by AFMC SCM-R
                 Funds Management Activity, no further action is required.
                 5.3.9.4.1.2.5. If neither approval nor disapproval was obtained, the AFMC
                 SCM-R Funds Management Activity must record approval or disapproval on
                 the listing.
                   5.3.9.4.1.2.5.1. If the shipment is approved, no further action is required.
                   5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2. If the shipment is not approved, the AFMC SCM-R Funds
                   Management Activity will take the following actions together with
                   personnel from base level Customer Support/SMAG Liaison POCs to
                   coordinate with Materiel Management Flight/transportation activity and the
                   shipment processing activity (AFMC SCM R or LRS/Materiel Management
                   Activity):
                      5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.1. Attempt to stop the shipment.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  175


                   5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.2. Recover the shipping document.
                   5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.3. Reverse-post the transaction.
                   5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.4. Reinput the shipment as a normal reimbursable
                   transaction.
                5.3.9.4.1.2.5.3. If a FREE SHPMNT cannot be aborted, the AFMC SCM-R
                Funds Management Activity marks the listing as disapproved with
                comments indicating the attempt to stop the shipment was unsuccessful.
                Before forwarding the original request to Stock Control, AFMC SCM-R
                Funds Management Activity will sign and mark/stamp the original to
                indicate whether the request was approved or disapproved.
                5.3.9.4.1.2.5.4. When AFMC SCM-R Funds Management Activity returns
                the approved or disapproved requests, Stock Control will take the following
                actions:
                5.3.9.4.1.2.5.5. Process a SHP input for approved requests with advice code
                2E.
                5.3.9.4.1.2.5.6. Process a SHP input for disapproved requests without an
                advice code.
       5.3.9.4.2. Shipment of Serviceable Assets Direct from a Detail.
          5.3.9.4.2.1. Use of Document Numbers. The detail document number must be
          entered in positions 67-80 when serviceable assets are to be shipped from MSK,
          supply point, MRSP, or WRM details.
          5.3.9.4.2.2. Automatic Replenishment of Assets. The ILS-S automatically
          initiates replenishment requisitioning for shipped MSK, supply point, MRSP, or
          WRM assets unless the TEX code in position 51 of the shipment transaction
          (SHP) contains a “+.”
       5.3.9.4.3. Classified and Sensitive Item Shipments.
          5.3.9.4.3.1. Release of Classified/Sensitive Items. Classified material will be
          released only to individuals identified by the LRS CC/AO as authorized to receive
          classified material. When someone is to receive classified material, first check the
          individual's military or civilian identification card and verify his/her identity.
          Identity will be verified against approved classified authorization list/letter. Make
          the identity check before the individual signs the DD Form 1348-1A and before
          releasing the materiel.
          5.3.9.4.3.2. Preparation of DD Form 1348-1A Hand Receipt. The ILS-S prepares
          three copies of the DD Form 1348-1A for use as a hand receipt for directed and
          non-directed shipments of classified/sensitive items (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
          Ch 2 5 for the Classified Hand Receipt Output Format). Requirements for off-
          base shipment of these items must contain one of the classified or sensitive
          controlled item codes (listed in DoD 4100.39-M, Vol10, Table 61).
              5.3.9.4.3.2.1. Asset Management personnel stamp or write CLASSIFIED
              ITEM in red ink on all copies of DD Form 1348-1A when a shipment (FTR,
176                                                      AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             A2*, A4*, SHP, or A5J) is produced for a classified item.
             5.3.9.4.3.2.2. LRS/transportation activity personnel place the three extra
             copies in the shipping container with the other shipment documents.
             5.3.9.4.3.2.3. DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally Record is used only for the
             transportation portion of a movement.
      5.3.9.4.4. Movement of Classified Shipments via GSA Contract Carrier. Secret and
      Confidential freight shipments may be moved within CONUS via the GSA contract
      small package express carrier provided there is strict adherence to the restrictions and
      processes contained in AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo.
      Shipments must comply with provisions contained in DoDM 5100.76, V3 and AFI
      31-401.     LRS/transportation activity personnel must develop locally written
      procedures with LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel, information
      management, and security personnel covering the preparation, handling, receipt,
      documentation, and delivery of classified shipments using this method of
      transportation. Ensure these procedures include the possible shipment of classified
      property directly from decentralized support elements such as flight-line operated
      parts stores and flight service centers.
         5.3.9.4.4.1. Cargo Movement is responsible for ensuring the package, wrapping,
         marking, and addressing are in compliance with applicable directives if packed by
         Cargo Movement, otherwise it is the shipper’s responsibility. The carrier’s
         package may be used as the outer wrapper. Classification markings, packing lists,
         and classified document receipts will be located on the inner container. Contact
         local Cargo Movement personnel, and review AFI 24-203, Preparation and
         Movement of Air Force Cargo for guidance when considering using the GSA
         contract small package express carrier for movement of classified material.
      5.3.9.4.5. Reliability Improvement Warranty (RIW) Item Shipments.
         5.3.9.4.5.1. Identification of RIW Items. RIW items are managed by the AFMC
         item manager and are identified in the ILS-S by the SNUD. SNUD performs the
         following for RIW assets:
             5.3.9.4.5.1.1. Set the item record RIW program to 1.
             5.3.9.4.5.1.2. Set the repair cycle record RIW program code to G.
             5.3.9.4.5.1.3. Changes the disposition field to the database key of the
             applicable shipping destination record.
         5.3.9.4.5.2. Redistribution of Serviceable/Unserviceable RIW Items.         Item
         Manager-directed RIW shipments to the DLADS will be processed IAW Disposal
         and Demilitarization instructions described in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6.
         RIW shipments processed for return to a contractor must contain project code 390
         and project name PACER WARRANT. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for
         the format of the RIW Shipment Notification (XFA) transaction.
             5.3.9.4.5.2.1. Results of RIMCS Loads. Most RIW items will be assigned
             RAMPS report codes, and the load of RIMCS data found on SNUD will
             usually create an automatic shipment. However, if the TIN was input with
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                177


              TEX code 1 (to request offline disposition from the applicable item manager)
              the asset can be shipped to the routing identifier code. These shipments are
              accomplished by making a SHP input using the serial number in positions 46-
              50 of the RIMCS input image.
              5.3.9.4.5.2.2. Processing Through Intermediate Repair Facilities. If the RIW
              contractor has an intermediate repair facility at the Primary Supply Point
              (PSP) base, and if all reparable assets must be processed through this facility
              because of a contractual agreement, then the off-shore activity must load a
              shipment override record identifying the intermediate facility as the ship-to
              SRAN. This load will override the automatic shipment to the intermediate
              facility.
       5.3.9.4.6. NWRM SHP/A2x/A4x Shipments: Before sourcing for lateral support, the
       NWRM Transaction Control Center (NTCC) will always verify that D035 does not
       already reflect a shipment released against the original due-in.
          5.3.9.4.6.1. LRS\Materiel Management Activity will provide the NTCC with the
          requestor’s information along with NSN, part number, quantity, unit of issue,
          gaining base SRAN, applicable serial number(s), and condition code.
          5.3.9.4.6.2. NTCC will contact the IM to ensure the gaining base/address is
          authorized to receive the asset(s).
          5.3.9.4.6.3. NTCC will lift the freeze code “N” via FFC processing, process the
          SHP/A2x/A4x request, then reprocess the freeze code “N”.
              5.3.9.4.6.4. NTCC will notify the IM of pending shipment and will track
              asset(s) through transportation channels to final destination.
              5.3.9.4.6.5. NTCC will update Positive Inventory Control (PIC) Fusion.
       5.3.9.4.7. Deficient Item Shipment Conditions That Warrant Shipped Not Credited
       (SNC) Detail Creation Procedures: Shipments for unserviceable budget code 9
       deficient items are manually initiated by the AFMC SCM-R Activity via Non-
       directed Shipment (SHP) transactions. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for
       detailed processing instructions). This SNC detail provides Accounting and Finance
       with a suspense record for identifying and following up on transactions for credit
       purposes.
       5.3.9.4.8. Disposition of Certain Chemical Defense Equipment (CDE).
          5.3.9.4.8.1. This paragraph applies to the disposition/return of certain CDE by
          use of routing identifier code B14 which is managed by the U.S. Army Armament
          Munitions and Chemical Command, Rock Island IL.
          5.3.9.4.8.2. Procedures.    To ensure the Air Force complies with Army
          requirements, the following procedures apply:
              5.3.9.4.8.2.1. Stock Control assigns SEX code 2 to item records for the stock
              numbers listed below. The ILS-S will report CDE to RID B14 for disposition
              instructions via Report of Redistributable (Excess) Materiel (FTE)
              transactions, regardless of excess or asset condition.

                 5.3.9.4.8.2.2. All returns of CDE material, regardless of condition, must be
                 correctly packaged and labeled. All NSNs should be packed separately to
                 facilitate depot receipt, handling, and safe storage. Return items must be
                 labeled or manifested as hazardous waste.
   5.3.10. Organizational Refusals.
       5.3.10.1. Purpose: To explain the organizational refusal procedure process. For policy
       specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
       5.3.10.2. Organizational refusals occur when a customer refuses to accept an item for
       any number of reasons.
          5.3.10.2.1. When this occurs the person refusing the property (the custodian or his
          alternate for equipment items) must annotate all copies of the ISU/MSI/DOR
          document with the phrase ORGANIZATION REFUSAL, give a brief explanation for
          refusing the property, and sign the document.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   179


     5.3.10.3. LRS Transportation Actions. LRS transportation personnel will return the
     property along with the issue/due out release document to materiel management
     inspection activity.
     5.3.10.4. LRS\Materiel Management Activity Inspection Actions. Upon receipt of an
     item and applicable issue/due-out release document annotated with ORGANIZATIONAL
     REFUSAL, Inspection personnel will determine the primary responsibility for the refusal.
     Inspection personnel will consider the reason for refusal stated on the issue/due-out
     release document and an inspection of the item when making this determination. For
     example, the LRS/Materiel Management Activity is responsible if the property is
     misidentified, unserviceable, an unsuitable substitute, or the quantity issued is in excess
     of what the customer ordered. However, the customer is responsible if the wrong item
     was ordered, or if the item was shipped due to a failure to cancel a due-out. See AFH
     23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, for more specific information about processing Organizational
     Refusals. Note: Do NOT reverse-post items returned because 1) too many were issued,
     or 2) the wrong item was issued and returned after having been signed for. Process these
     items according to the correct return (TIN) procedures explained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
     Pt 1, Ch 6.
  5.3.11. Deficiency Reports.
     5.3.11.1. Purpose: To explain deficiency report procedures process. For policy specific
     requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123.
     5.3.11.2. Upon receipt of a supply or equipment item with a deficiency or latent defect,
     report the Deficiency Report asset and prepare the asset for immediate return according
     to T.O. 00-35D-54.
     5.3.11.3. Control of Deficiency Report Exhibits. The originating point maintains control
     of the exhibit when the size and configuration of the asset allows. When the exhibit size
     and configuration allow, move the exhibit to a controlled area (preferably locked) to
     ensure the exhibit is not altered or lost. Normally, this controlled area is in the
     LRS/Materiel Management Activity. When there is not enough space in the
     LRS/Materiel Management Activity, maintenance may store the exhibit pending final
     disposition. There is an exception to this policy when maintenance becomes the
     permanent storage location. If the need arises to establish a permanent storage area
     within maintenance, the organization must request approval authority from AF/A4LM,
     through its MAJCOM.
     5.3.11.4. Materiel Deficiency Returns. Process Deficiency Report to include latent
     defect returns as follows. Maintenance personnel initiating deficiency returns must
     provide materiel management personnel with a copy of the initial deficiency report (DR)
     submittal paperwork with the deficient property at the time of return. The return will not
     be processed without the required paperwork.
         5.3.11.4.1. Unserviceable Supply (ERRCD X**) Items. For unserviceable supply
         item returns, indicate the unsatisfactory condition of materiel by entering supply
         condition code Q and action taken code C. EXCEPTION: Use action taken code C
         and supply condition E for Federal Supply Class (FSC) 3110 routing identifier code
         Sxx, ERRCD XF3.
180                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.3.11.4.2. The ILS-S will programmatically assign supply condition code Q to the
         unserviceable.
         5.3.11.4.3. The ILS-S will programmatically update the appropriate details (for
         example, due-in from maintenance (DIFM), in-use) when returns with action taken
         code C are processed.
         5.3.11.4.4. The ILS-S will produce a management notice I012 (stock awaiting
         disposition) on the input terminal reflecting the unserviceable detail document
         number. A 156ALL inquiry will also be programmatically printed reflecting the NSN
         affected by the deficiency report action. Be sure to attach a copy of the management
         notice to the property so it can be readily identified.
      5.3.11.5. Processing Deficiency Report Returns. The Flight Service Center (FSC) will
      process Deficiency Report or latent defect returns for items assigned ERRCD XD, XF,
      XB. EAE will process return documents for Deficiency Report or latent defects on
      equipment managed items. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for return (TIN) formats.
      FSC/ EAE will process the return if the pre-degraded operations method is used and
      Cargo Movement will perform this task if degraded operations method is used.
         5.3.11.5.1. If deficiency report items are assigned budget code 8 or 9, the ILS-S
         return program logic will automatically grant credit (assign credit code Y) based upon
         the action taken code of C and condition code Q. Funds manager approval is not
         needed.
         5.3.11.5.2. Store deficiency report assets in a central location in the LRS/Materiel
         Management Activity warehouse unless the items are too large.
      5.3.11.6. Check for Similar Deficient Assets. FSC or EAE personnel (for equipment
      assets) will query the ILS-S database to determine if there are additional assets (with the
      same NSN) requiring deficiency report action. If additional assets exist, coordinate with
      the using maintenance activity to determine if the assets should be tested for similar
      deficiencies. If other assets have the same deficiency, use the following procedures:
         5.3.11.6.1. If an organization is using the asset, the maintenance activity reporting
         deficiency will determine whether the item should be used or turned in. If return is
         required, process the asset (according to the section above).
         5.3.11.6.2. If the asset is in base stock, coordinate with the maintenance activity to
         determine whether the assets should be removed from stock or remain in stock. If the
         assets are to be removed, process according to this section.
         5.3.11.6.3. Use the instructions in T.O. 00-35D-54 to monitor deficiency report
         pending actions. The deficiency report will be monitored using the materiel
         deficiency report portion of the unserviceable DIFM Detail List. When the maximum
         hold date is exceeded and no disposition instructions have been received, follow
         instructions in T.O. 00-35D-54.
      5.3.11.7. Deficient Warranty Item Returns. For pre-post returns, forward property and
      all copies of the DD Form 1348-1A to the holding area.
         5.3.11.7.1. If the defective item is authorized for field level repair, determine whether
         the item should be repaired or if disposition should be requested from the SPM/IM. If
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  181


        the item is mission essential and in critical short supply and non-availability would
        adversely affect the mission capability of the activity concerned, the item should be
        repaired locally and returned to service. On those defective warranted items which are
        not turned in to LRS/Materiel Management Activity but are repaired on site,
        maintenance will notify supply of their decision to repair. LRS/Materiel Management
        Activity, in turn, will advise the SPM/IM by message including the information
        below that the item was repaired and returned to service.
        5.3.11.7.2. RIW items will not be repaired locally, except in such cases where the
        warranty identification tags and/or equipment technical order specifies that such
        repair is authorized. Procedures for RIW items are contained below.
        5.3.11.7.3. On items for which disposition instructions are required, attach a DD
        Form 1575, Suspended Tag - Materiel/1575-1, Suspended Label-Materiel, to the item
        to identify the item as an exhibit with condition code "Q."
        5.3.11.7.4. Notify the applicable SPM/IM (T.O. 00-25-115) by message of the
        defective item furnishing the NSN, contract number, and all data available regarding
        the defect and request disposition instructions.
        5.3.11.7.5. Follow disposition instructions according to SPM/IM.
  5.3.12. Bench Stock (Add, Change, Delete and Reconciliation).
     5.3.12.1. Purpose: To explain bench stock procedures process. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.3.12.2. Bench stocks are consumable items kept on-hand in a work center to increase
     mission support. As such, the ILS-S includes functionality that makes use of historical
     organizational item consumption data to recommend the quantity of items customers
     should include, maintain or delete in organizational bench stocks. However, the process
     also provides customers the flexibility to include consumable items in their bench stocks
     with little or no historical consumption. The specific criteria for bench stock item
     qualification are provided in Para 5.3.12.5. The logic used in the ILS-S for determining
     bench stock item add, change, and deletion recommendations is described in Para
     5.3.12.6
     5.3.12.3. Advantages and Disadvantages of Bench Stocks.
        5.3.12.3.1. Advantages of Bench Stocks. Bench stock items are physically stored in
        the maintenance work area, bench stock customers have ready access to the items as
        needed. Consumption of bench stock items requires no paperwork or communication
        with LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel. Bench stocks also result in
        reduced workload for base logistics support activities since the items are periodically
        replenished in bulk quantities rather than being issued, picked, and delivered
        individually each time a customer need occurs.
        5.3.12.3.2. Disadvantages of Bench Stocks. Bench stock inventory must be
        purchased at the time of replenishment since maintenance funds are expended for the
        purchase of bench stock items in advance of actual need, there is at least some
        potential for buying unneeded items. Organizational bench stock customers must also
        provide the storage space and storage bins required for maintaining bench stock
182                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         inventories. There is also an organizational workload associated with periodically
         coordinating bench stock inventory range and depth updates with base logistics
         support personnel. The establishment and maintenance of customer bench stock
         records is a recurring workload for LRS/Materiel Management personnel. Finally,
         from a materiel management point of view, it is disadvantageous that inventory
         issued to organizational bench stocks is no longer visible within ILS-S.
      5.3.12.4. Bench Stock Responsibilities for Organizational Customers and LRS/Materiel
      Management Activity Personnel.
         5.3.12.4.1. The organizational commander will appoint a primary and alternate bench
         stock monitor.
         5.3.12.4.2. The Organizational Customer will be responsible for the following:
            5.3.12.4.2.1. All newly appointed bench stock monitors shall attend/receive Base-
            Level Supply Customer Training as it pertains to Block I (General Supply
            Indoctrination) and Block IIA/B (Bench Stock/Repair Cycle) training prior to
            assuming responsibilities as a bench stock monitor.
            5.3.12.4.2.2. Provide secure bench stock storage.
                5.3.12.4.2.2.1. Care and safe-guard bench stocks IAW AFI 23-111,
                Management of Government Property in Possession of the AF.
            5.3.12.4.2.3. Ensure controls are established for shelf life items to ensure that
            older shelf life items are used first to minimize the occurrence of expired,
            unusable items.
            5.3.12.4.2.4. Monitoring each bench stock item balance and flagging items for
            replenishment when the on-hand balance is less than or equal to 50 percent of the
            authorized stock level.
            5.3.12.4.2.5. Reviewing bench stock due-outs. The ILS-S will provide each
            organization with a Daily Document Register that will serve as the basis for the
            review. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for a complete description of the Daily
            Document Register. Bench stock customers may also obtain Due-Out Status
            Listings to validate organizational bench stock backorders. See AFH 23-123, Vol
            2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for additional information about Due-Out Status Listings.
         5.3.12.4.3. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will be responsible for the
         following:
            5.3.12.4.3.1. Create and maintain bench stock records to document requested and
            approved customer bench stock authorization requests. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
            Pt 1, Ch 5 for transactions and procedures required to Load Master Bench Stock
            Detail Records (2BSL), Master Bench Stock Record Change (2BSC), Master
            Bench Stock Record/EOQ Delete (2BSD), and Master Bench Stock Consolidation
            (2BSCON) transactions.
                5.3.12.4.3.1.1. Maintain Master Bench stock file.     The LRS\Materiel
                Management Activity Customer Support maintains this file on each account
                which exists at base level.

      5.3.12.5. Bench Stock Item Qualification Criteria. Before a bench stock is established,
      the following minimum criteria must be met.
         5.3.12.5.1. The item record Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Coded
         (ERRC) designator must be XB3.
         5.3.12.5.2. Restricted Item Codes. In general, the item record must not be coded as
         follows:
             5.3.12.5.2.1. Disposal (numeric parts preference code (NPPC) 2). On-hand/in-use
             assets that have an NPPC 2 may be issued/used if they satisfy a local requirement
             or until the cost to repair the item exceeds its value.
             5.3.12.5.2.2. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) (numeric parts
             preference code 4).
             5.3.12.5.2.3. Non-published (numeric parts preference code 5). On-hand/in-use
             assets that have an NPPC 5 may be issued/used if they satisfy a local requirement
             or until the cost to repair the item exceeds its value.
             5.3.12.5.2.4. Unacceptable for AF use (numeric parts preference code 9).
             5.3.12.5.2.5. Recoverable Assembly Management             Process   (RAMPS)/War
             Reserve Material (WRM) codes 5, 6, 7, or E.
             5.3.12.5.2.6. Classified, sensitive, or issue exception codes (IEX) 3, 6, E, or K.
             Additional details regarding classified items are provided later in this chapter.
         5.3.12.5.3. Quantity Irregularities. Items that are normally used in quantities that are
         different from the unit of issue (for example, nuts, bolts, screws, etc.) and items that
         have a quantity of issue different from the quantity unit pack, should be added to
         bench stock to the maximum levels possible.
         5.3.12.5.4. Controlled Items in Bench Stocks. The following rules apply to items
         with a controlled item code. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 and DoD 4100.39-M
         for details about controlled item codes.
             5.3.12.5.4.1. Controlled Items Not Requiring IEX. Controlled item code *, I, J,
             U, 7, Y, and Z are authorized on bench stock. None of these categories require
             issue exception codes loaded on the item record.
             5.3.12.5.4.2. Controlled Items Requiring IEX. Controlled item code R items,
             other than photographic items, are authorized on bench stock when the unit
             commander has given his approval in writing. Items in this category will require
             an issue exception code N to be loaded to the item record.
             5.3.12.5.4.3. Photographic Items. Controlled item code *, J, R, or X items may be
             authorized on bench stock with the written approval of the unit commander who
             controls and manages bench stock.
                5.3.12.5.4.3.1. Requesting Approval. The shop supervisor/bench stock
                manager will send a letter to his/her commander asking to add the items to
                bench stock (specifying org/shop code). The letter will list the national stock
                number (NSN), nomenclature, and unit of issue of each photographic type of
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 185


               item to be added.
               5.3.12.5.4.3.2. Approval Letters. If the additional items are approved, endorse
               the letter to the Customer Support Liaison Element. After LRS/Materiel
               Management Activity personnel take action, Customer Support Liaison
               Element will endorse the letter back to the applicable unit commander so a
               successor will be aware of the action and comply with AFI 23-111.
           5.3.12.5.4.4. Controlled Item Codes S and C. With MAJCOM approval, items
           with controlled item codes S and C items may be included on organizational
           bench stocks when demand data indicates it is advantageous to do so. In
           accordance with MAJCOM guidelines, supplement this chapter with a local issue
           exception code indicating, “Classified/Secret Item authorized on Bench Stock.”
           When authorized by MAJCOM, classified bench stock material must meet all
           security, storage, and access provisions outlined in AFI 31-401, and DoDM
           5100.76, V3.
           5.3.12.5.4.5. Other Controlled Item Codes. Controlled item codes not specified
           above are authorized on bench stock when the unit commander has given
           approval in writing. Assigning issue exception code N to the item record will
           further identify items in this category. When IEX N is assigned, the other item
           flag for bench stock items will be assigned with a stock control data change. The
           bench stock flag will be assigned by the ILS-S when a master bench stock detail
           is loaded.
        5.3.12.5.5. Budget code S items need to be approved /coordinated with the CICP.
        5.3.12.5.6. Off-Base Supported Organizations. Unless specifically included in a joint
        tenancy agreement, or some specific directive, the LRS/Materiel Management
        Activity will not perform a walk-thru inventory of bench stock assets to off-base
        organizations.
     5.3.12.6. Bench Stock Item Add, Change and Delete Logic.
        5.3.12.6.1. This logic is used in the ILS-S to develop recommendations for adding,
        deleting, and changing the quantities of items in organizational bench stocks.
        5.3.12.6.2. Guidelines for Adding and Deleting Items from Bench Stocks. The bench
        stock process makes use of organizational historical consumption and customer
        desires to determine what range of items to include in a customer bench stock. The
        range determination may result in the addition or deletion of an item from a bench
        stock.
           5.3.12.6.2.1. Bench Stock Additions. The identification of candidates for bench
           stock addition is either consumption-based or specified by bench stock customers.
               5.3.12.6.2.1.1. Consumption-Based Bench Stock Add Recommendations. The
               ILS-S uses organization-specific historical consumption data to identify items
               that, based on past demand, price, and other item characteristics, are
               candidates for addition to an organizational bench stock. For details about
               ILS-S procedures for identifying bench stock addition candidates, see the
               Bench Stock Review (M04/NGV850) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. The
186                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                bench stock review logic recommends items for addition to organizational
                bench stocks meeting the qualifying conditions detailed in Para 5.3.12.5 of
                this section where organizational economic order quantity (EOQ)
                consumption detail record indicates there have been three or more customer
                demands and the EOQ consumption detail has existed for at least 30 days.
                5.3.12.6.2.1.2. Non-Consumption-Based       Bench       Stock    Additions.
                Organizational bench stock customers can request the addition of qualifying
                items to bench stocks regardless of historical consumption under certain
                conditions. See Para 5.3.12.8 of this section for a complete list of non-
                consumption-based bench stock qualification conditions.
            5.3.12.6.2.2. Bench Stock Deletions. Like additions, bench stock deletion
            candidates are based on organizational consumption history and bench stock
            customer desires.
                5.3.12.6.2.2.1. Consumption-Based          Deletion       Recommendations.
                Consumption-based bench stock items that become inactive (have no
                consumption) are candidates for deletion from bench stocks.
                5.3.12.6.2.2.2. Non-Consumption-Based Deletions. Organizational bench
                stock owners may request deletion of bench stock items at any time based
                upon mission support or financial considerations.
         5.3.12.6.3. Bench Stock Quantity Determination. The determination of what quantity
         to apply to customer bench stocks is based upon consumption and non-consumption
         based support periods for individual items.
            5.3.12.6.3.1. Consumption-based Support Period. Unless otherwise specified by
            the organizational bench stock owner, the depth of stock for bench stock items is
            calculated based upon a 30-day support requirement. That is, the bench stock
            quantity is the quantity required to fill the organization’s anticipated demands,
            based on their historical demand history, for a 30-day period.
            5.3.12.6.3.2. Non-Consumption-Based       Support      Period.    Organization
            commanders may deviate from the 30-day support requirement by specifying an
            alternative number of support days in the Organizational Bench Stock Stockage
            Days Field of the BS OCCR.
         5.3.12.6.4. Organizational Cost Center Record (OCCR) Bench Stock Stockage Days
         Field. When the bench stock stockage days field is populated, the ILS-S will use that
         value in calculating the depth of stock for bench stock items. Additionally, bench
         stock quantity calculations are altered as specified when a master bench stock detail
         record contains a minimum reserve authorization (MRA) or a maximum authorization
         quantity (MAQ).
      5.3.12.7. Conditions for Non-Consumption-Based Bench Stock Additions. Conditions
      for Non-Consumption-based Bench Stock Item Additions. An item may be added to
      bench stock via MRA and MAQ procedures described in Para 5.3.12.8 this section,
      regardless of consumption data, if one of the following conditions applies:
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       187


            5.3.12.7.1. The end-item being supported is a primary mission aircraft, missile
            system, or communications electronic maintenance (CEM), and the Deputy
            Commander for Maintenance has determined that maintenance cannot wait for the
            item to be delivered from a LRS/Materiel Management Activity warehouse.
            5.3.12.7.2. The using activity is off base or in a remote area of the base, and the item
            must be at the using location.
            5.3.12.7.3. The unit of issue is not compatible with the unit of use (such as nuts,
            bolts, and screws) or with the quantity unit pack (QUP) (such as wire which comes in
            50 foot rolls).
        5.3.12.8. Procedures for Establishing Non-Consumption-Based Bench Stock Items.
        Commands have the option to use adjusted stock levels to support bench stock items.
        Bases will use MRA or MAQ procedures to establish, order, and maintain adequate
        stockage for bench stock levels not based on normal consumption.
            5.3.12.8.1. MAQ/MRA Flags. The Bench Stock Review (M04/NGV850) in AFH 23-
            123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 is normally used to calculate bench stock authorized quantities.
            Bench stock authorized quantities that are not based on consumption may be
            established via the use of MAQ or MRA procedures. See Para 5.3.12.8.3 this section
            for the details about how to specify MRA/MAQ quantities and flags in Master Bench
            Stock detail records. MRA/MAQ flags and their definitions are provided in Table 5.4

Table 5.4. MRA/MAQ Flags and Definitions.
     Code                                        Meaning

 1            Bench stock minimum reserve authorization based on a 30-day requirement.
     2         Bench stock maximum authorized quantity based on a 30-day requirement.
     3        Bench stock minimum reserve authorization based on a 45-day requirement.
     4       Bench stock maximum authorization quantity based on a 45-day requirement.
     A        Bench stock minimum reserve authorization based on a 60-day requirement.
     B       Bench stock maximum quantity authorization based on a 60-day requirement.
     C           Authorization based on consumption for 60 days with no bench stock
                                          minimum reserve.
     D        QUP to be considered when computing recommended level. Using this code
                  does not prevent automatic deletion if normal deletion criteria apply.
  BLANK          Authorization based on consumption for 30 days with no bench stock
                                          minimum reserve.
5.3.12.8.2. Not Used
            5.3.12.8.3. Impact of MRA/MAQ Flags on Bench Stock Quantity Calculations.
               5.3.12.8.3.1. MRA/MAQ Flag A, B, C, 3, or 4. If a master bench stock detail
               record contains an MRA/MAQ flag of A, B, C, 3, or 4, the MRA/MAQ will
               override the bench stock stockage days.
               5.3.12.8.3.2. MRA/MAQ Flag C. If the MRA/MAQ flag is a C, the authorized
               quantity will be computed based on 60-day consumption.
188                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


           5.3.12.8.3.3. MRA/MAQ Flag 1, 3, or A. If the MRA/MAQ flag is 1, 3, or A, the
           authorized quantity will be the MRA or the computed consumption quantity,
           whichever is greater. When the date of last demand (DOLD) is greater than 270
           days, the item is no longer considered for automatic change, review procedures
           must be accomplished.
           5.3.12.8.3.4. MRA/MAQ Flag 2, 4, or B. If the MRA/MAQ flag is 2, 4, or B, the
           authorized quantity will be the maximum authorized or the computed
           consumption quantity, whichever is smaller. When the DOLD is greater than 270
           days, the item is no longer considered for automatic change, and review
           procedures must be accomplished.
        5.3.12.8.4. MRA/MAQ Quantity Letters. Recertification of MRA/MAQ will be
        accomplished through the review process.
        5.3.12.8.5. Conformity. MRA/MAQ quantity changes required for conformance with
        quantity unit pack or materiel handling requirements do not require a letter from the
        supported organization and may be accomplished by annotating the listing.
      5.3.12.9. Master Bench Stock Record Load. Bench Stock Review Program
      Recommended Additions.
        5.3.12.9.1. The monthly Bench Stock Review Program will produce a listing of those
        items, which qualify for addition to an organizational bench stock. These additions
        are computed from the EOQ consumption detail records, which are built from issues,
        and due-out releases processed for expendable (ERRCD XB3) items that are not
        currently on bench stock. When these listed items are not recommended for addition,
        these details are maintained in the database for 180 days before they are deleted.
        Once an item has been recommended for addition, it will stay in the database for 30
        days. If at the end of the 30-day period the item has not been added to a bench stock,
        the detail will be deleted and the consumption data will be deleted from the records.
        5.3.12.9.2. Recommended add transactions will not be produced for items that are
        assigned RAMPS/WRM report codes 5, 6, 7, or E. If the organization elects to add
        these items to their bench stock and a reject (extended cost exceeds $1000.00 EOQ
        item) is produced when the transaction is processed, the organization should be
        notified so they can determine if a suitable substitute can be added to their bench
        stock in place of the originally recommended add item. See Load Master Bench
        Stock Detail Record (2BS) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S
        information and processing.
        5.3.12.9.3. Addition of Items Not on the Bench Stock Review Program Listing. Upon
        receipt of a request to add items which are not on the monthly bench stock add listing,
        LRS\Materiel Management Activity Customer Support Center personnel will
        accomplish the following:
           5.3.12.9.3.1. Verify the stock number and unit of issue.
           5.3.12.9.3.2. Furnish the issue exception code, application code, and system
           designator for each item.
           5.3.12.9.3.3. Review each item to ensure that all criteria for bench stock are met.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  189


            5.3.12.9.3.4. Obtain necessary approvals and notify the requesting activity of
            action taken.
            5.3.12.9.3.5. Prepare and process a load input as described in this chapter to load
            the master bench stock detail.
            5.3.12.9.3.6. Prepare and process a bench stock issue. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
            1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing Bench Stock Issue (1BS)
            transactions
     5.3.12.10. Master Bench Stock Record Change. Changes to the authorized quantity on
     existing master bench stock details are made automatically during the review. The
     MRA/MAQ flag is considered, as well as consumption, in computing new levels. See
     Para.5.3.12.8.3. for additional information about MRA/MAQ flags. Organizations may
     request changes to a bench stock at any time via telephone, letter, email, or annotated
     listing. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing
     Master Bench Stock Record Change (2BSC) transactions.
        5.3.12.10.1. Authorized Quantity Changes. An authorized quantity change is
        computed only for substantial changes in consumption patterns. For this computation,
        a change that exceeds the square root of the previous authorized quantity is defined as
        substantial. The review program does not make changes smaller than the square root
        of the previous authorized quantity.
        5.3.12.10.2. 30-day Consumption Factor. A 30-day consumption factor will be used
        unless one of the following exists:
            5.3.12.10.2.1. The organization cost center record contains bench stock stockage
            days.
            5.3.12.10.2.2. The master bench stock detail record contains an MRA/MAQ flag
            of A, B, C, 3, or 4. If both conditions exist, the MRA/MAQ will override the
            bench stock stockage days.
     5.3.12.11. Bench Stock Routine, Stock-Out, Urgent Replenishment and Due-Out
     Procedures. The normal responsibilities of Customer Support Center personnel include
     assistance in the establishment, change or deletion of Master Bench Stock details as well
     as the processing of bench stock issue requests as applicable.
        5.3.12.11.1. Routine Bench Stock Cycle Replenishment. Bench stock items should
        be replenished when the quantity on hand is equal to or less than 50 percent of the
        authorized quantity. This should be done once every 30 days (or more often as
        necessary). The unit bench stock monitor will perform the following:
            5.3.12.11.1.1. Weekly Walk-Through. Red flags should be displayed if the stock
            is below 50 percent of the authorized bench stock level whether a due-out has
            been established or not. At the option of the LRS CC/AO and supported
            organization, the unit bench stock monitor may process routine bench stock
            replenishment requests as soon as the 50 percent or below level is reached. The
            LRS CC/AO may authorize the organizational bench stock monitor use the ILS-S
            to enter their replenishment requests. When this option is used, the organization
            may waive the weekly walk through.
190                                                      AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.3.12.11.1.2. Document Replenishment Needs. Unit bench stock monitors will
         circle the item numbers on the AF Form 465, Bench Stock Inventory (Not LRA)
         which require replenishment and then process issue requests. Customer Support
         Center personnel will process requests bench stock issue requests for units not
         having that capability. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S
         information and processing Bench Stock Issue (1BS) transactions.
         5.3.12.11.1.3. Coordinating Customer Excess Disposition. Customer Support
         personnel will coordinate with the supported activity to take the appropriate
         action when excess bench stock inventory exists. Items will not be considered
         excess until the on-hand balance is more than twice the authorization. Excesses
         will initially be considered for return review (to determine if return is desired--or
         necessary, as in the case of storage problems within the bench stock).
      5.3.12.11.2. Stock-Out and Urgent Bench Stock Replenishment Procedures.
         5.3.12.11.2.1. Stock-Out (Empty Bin) Reports. The organization may request
         normal issue processing to replenish the entire bench stock authorization
         providing a backorder does not already exist for this item.
         5.3.12.11.2.2. Urgent Bench Stock Requirements. The method to satisfy urgent
         bench stock requirements will be determined by the LRS/Materiel Management
         Activity in coordination with the supported activity. One of the following
         methods will be used.
         5.3.12.11.2.3. Submit Issue Request. Process a priority issue request or call in an
         expedite issue request to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity using activity
         code X and then follow normal issue procedures described earlier in this chapter,
         including the re-input of any killed quantity after validation. Items will be
         delivered within specified delivery times.
         5.3.12.11.2.4. Submit Request to Customer Support Center. The Customer
         Support Center will input a bench stock issue. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5
         Expendable Item Customer Issue Request (ISU) transaction format and
         processing instructions. If the request is filled (issued), a DD Form 1348-1A
         output issue document will be produced. The customer will be notified of item
         availability by telephone. The output issue document will be hand-carried to the
         appropriate warehouse for item location. Issued items will be delivered within
         specified delivery times.
      5.3.12.11.3. After Duty Hour Requests. Provide the applicable Customer Support
      function with all the bench stock issue requests outside normal duty hours.
      5.3.12.11.4. Supply Support Delays. If the supply support (timeliness of receipts) for
      an organizational bench stock is ineffective, the Customer Support Center may
      request a Due-Out Status Listing or any other management product, or develop a QLP
      or SURGE program to ensure satisfactory supply action has been taken for due-outs.
      This will be coordinated with Stock Control to ensure maximum bench stock support.
      5.3.12.11.5. Bench Stock Due-Out Processing.
         5.3.12.11.5.1. Establish Firm Backorder (Due-Out). The Customer Support
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   191


            Center will establish a firm customer backorder (due-out) for all initial bench
            stock fill requests that are processed when property is not available for issue.
               5.3.12.11.5.1.1. Due-Out Quantity Balances. If a backorder (due-out) already
               exists for the full authorized bench stock quantity, the issue request will be
               killed. Bench stock backorders will only be created for the full authorized
               quantity. When a due-out is created as a result of a partial issue being
               processed by the ILS-S, the bench stock due-out will be created for the full
               authorized quantity. For each bench stock backorder, the cumulative
               recurring demand (CRD) field is updated on the master bench stock detail.
               5.3.12.11.5.1.2. Other Asset Notice. If an issue request is not satisfied and
               available items may be suitable, a management notice is produced. If any or
               all of the items are acceptable, reprocess the bench stock issue request with
               transaction exception code (TEX) C. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for
               more information on processing I023 Management Notices. The use of this
               TEX code will allow available assets to be issued in place of the originally
               requested item(s).
        5.3.12.11.6. Unsuitable Substitutes. If substitute items are available, but cannot be
        used, process issue requests for the usable item only; these issues may be identified as
        bench stock by using the mark-for field serial number portion to identify the line
        number, e.g. BS00433.
        5.3.12.11.7. Cancellation of Due-Outs. When a master bench stock detail is deleted
        by processing a Bench Stock Record/EOQ Delete (2BSD) transaction, the IT system
        will automatically cancel any existing due-out with the same stock number,
        organization and shop codes. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, Master Bench
        Stock Record/EOQ Delete Transaction for specific ILS-S information and processing.
        5.3.12.11.8. Lack of Funds. If insufficient funds exist for the requested item, the due-
        out is killed and a management notice (lack of funds) is produced. See AFH 23-123,
        Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for resolution of Input Exceeds Project FMR Fund Balance rejects.
        5.3.12.11.9. Due-Out Release Procedures. On-base due-out release of items for
        bench stocks will be delivered by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity to the
        organizational bench stock delivery location.
     5.3.12.12. Bench Stock Review Requirements and Responsibilities. The bench stock
     review process is designed to ensure bench stocks are regularly updated in a way that
     maximizes mission support.
        5.3.12.12.1. Three-Phase Review Process. The bench stock review will be made in
        three separate phases--monthly and semiannually for regular bench stock, and
        annually for standard reporting designator (SRD) and minimum reserve authorization.
        The semiannual review may be discontinued with the concurrence of the LRS CC/AO
        and the supported organizations.
            5.3.12.12.1.1. Phase I--Monthly Recommended Additions, Changes, and
            Deletions. Bench stock will be reviewed monthly for additions, changes, and
            deletions. Items recommended by IT system are based upon past issue and due-
192                                                 AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      out release action. Coordination with affected bench stock account representatives
      will be effected prior to changes being made. This requirement may be changed to
      quarterly at the option of the major command. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5
      for instructions on processing the Bench Stock Review listing on a quarterly
      basis.
      5.3.12.12.1.2. Phase II--Semiannual Recommended Additions, Changes, and
      Deletions. The Customer Support Liaison Element will arrange a semiannual joint
      review meeting with bench stock-supported-shops (determined jointly by the LRS
      CC/AO and the supported organization commander or Maintenance Chief).
         5.3.12.12.1.2.1. The Customer Support Liaison Element, Materiel Control,
         and the appropriate shop supervisor will participate in the joint review
         meeting. During these reviews, special emphasis must be given to items with
         no demands in the past year and items with excessive quantities not supported
         by demands. The semiannual review may be discontinued with the
         concurrence of the LRS CC/AO and the supported organization commander,
         but must be conducted at least annually.
         5.3.12.12.1.2.2. Processing of the Organizational Bench Stock Listing is not
         required when this review does not take place, but may be processed if
         requested by the Customer Support Liaison Element supervisor. This
         paragraph may be supplemented if local/MAJCOM requires this review to be
         accomplished more frequently. The review should not conflict with normally
         busy periods, such as end of month. Therefore, close coordination with the
         scheduler is needed to set the processing date for the semiannual review.
         5.3.12.12.1.2.3. All bench stocks will be replenished within 15 days of their
         scheduled semiannual reviews. After the review is concluded (within one
         work week), normal support to the shops will be resumed as quickly as
         possible. The one-week time limit may be extended by the major command
         for distant/remote off-base supported activities. Also, off-base organizations
         may be reviewed prior to on-base organizations to eliminate the delay in
         processing the Bench Stock Review.
         5.3.12.12.1.2.4. All changes and recommended deletions will be reviewed
         during the joint review meeting, and the listing annotated as needed, and then
         signed by reviewing participants. The Customer Support Liaison Element will
         keep a copy of the signed listing until the next review is completed.
         5.3.12.12.1.2.5. The Customer Support Liaison Element will provide copies
         of the Organization Bench Stock Listing to the applicable shop supervisor and
         Materiel Control (after all necessary actions have been taken). The listing
         assists shop personnel in the location of bench stock items. The Customer
         Support Liaison Element will also file a copy of the listing with the signed
         listing from the joint review meeting. The copy of the listing produced after
         the semiannual review may be replaced if a new listing is run before the next
         review. A thorough review is extremely important to ensure that bench stock
         supports the mission efficiently and economically.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                               193


             5.3.12.12.1.2.6. If approved by the LRS CC/AO and the supported
             organization commander or Maintenance Chief, the semi-annual joint review
             may be conducted by the following electronic means:
              5.3.12.12.1.2.6.1. LRS\Materiel Management Activity personnel will
              initiate the ILS-S generation of the Organizational Bench Stock Listing and
              forward it to the appropriate individual using any electronic means. Current
              technology will allow the listing to be sent via e-mail to the bench stock
              monitor or the organization’s electronic mail box. Future technology
              changes that allow transfer of listing will also be acceptable methods of
              forwarding the listing. Because the LRS\Materiel Management Activity
              Bench Stock Monitor will not be the chairperson for a formal meeting,
              reviewing organizations will ensure special emphasis is placed on the
              following items: items with no demands in the past year and items with
              excessive quantities not supported by demands.
              5.3.12.12.1.2.6.2. The review should not conflict with normally busy
              periods, such as end of month. Therefore, close coordination with the
              AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity scheduler is needed to set the
              processing date for the semiannual review.
              5.3.12.12.1.2.6.3. All shops will be replenished within 15 days of their
              scheduled semiannual reviews. After the review is concluded (within one
              work week), normal support to the shops will be resumed as quickly as
              possible. The one-week time limit may be extended by the major command
              for distant/remote off-base supported activities. Also, off-base organizations
              may be reviewed prior to on-base organizations to eliminate the delay in
              processing the Bench Stock Review.
              5.3.12.12.1.2.6.4. All changes and recommended deletions will be reviewed
              during the electronic review, and the listing annotated as needed. The using
              organization will prepare a memo for the record to be signed by the
              reviewing participant. The memo will indicate the following data elements:
              date the Organizational Bench Stock Listing was created; date review was
              completed; details requiring change; required change; name; rank; and
              phone number of individual(s) conducting the review. The memo will be
              forwarded to Customer Support Liaison who will make the indicated
              changes and maintain the signed memo until the next review is completed.
              5.3.12.12.1.2.6.5. Updated copies of the Organization Bench Stock Listing
              will be provided by the Customer Support Liaison for the applicable shop
              supervisor and Materiel Control (after all necessary actions have been
              taken). A thorough review is extremely important to ensure that bench stock
              supports the mission efficiently and economically.
             5.3.12.12.1.2.7. The Customer Support Liaison must keep the funds manager
             informed of significant increases or decreases in bench stock authorizations
             and demands. Organization commanders will find pertinent financial
             information included in each organization's bench stock listing. No bench
             stock orders will be filled unless funds are available in the project fund
194                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                management record.
            5.3.12.12.1.3. Phase III--Annual SRD/MRA Validation. SRD data and minimum
            reserve authorization levels must be validated annually at the same time as one of
            the semiannual bench stock reviews. Bench stock demands are identified to
            mission requirements only if proper SRD data are loaded. MRA levels may no
            longer be valid resulting in erroneous stock control practices. After phase II of the
            review has been completed, the following actions are required:
                5.3.12.12.1.3.1. A cover letter signed by the LRS CC/AO must accompany
                the Organization Bench Stock Listing provided to Materiel Control. The letter
                will request a review of all SRD and MRA data. There must also be a reply by
                endorsement, signed by the shop supervisor, to certify completion of the
                review.
                5.3.12.12.1.3.2. Changes resulting from the review will be submitted to the
                Customer Support Liaison, who will update the master bench stock record.
                5.3.12.12.1.3.3. A copy of the signed endorsement will be filed in the
                Customer Support Liaison and used for verification of the annual review.
      5.3.12.13. Bench Stock Issue Output Issue Document Format and Document Flow – DD
      Form 1348-1A.
         5.3.12.13.1. Bench Stock Issue Document Flow. See Bench Stock Issue Transaction
         in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing.
            5.3.12.13.1.1. Customer Support Liaison. Create the master bench stock issue
            request for items requiring replenishment.
            5.3.12.13.1.2. Asset Management Section.
                5.3.12.13.1.2.1. Off-base issues. Select the property to be issued and enter the
                date and name of the individual selecting the property on line 29 of the DD
                Form 1348-1A. Forward property with DD Form 1348-1A attached to
                transportation for shipment. The transportation function will sign, date, and
                distribute the DD Form 1348-1A.
                5.3.12.13.1.2.2. Bench stock issues. Select the property to be issued and enter
                the date and signature of the individual selecting the property on line 29 of the
                DD Form 1348-1A; notify the BSSS when property is ready for pickup.
            5.3.12.13.1.3. Place property and any corresponding documentation in the
            Deployment and Distribution holding area for customer delivery. Refer to AFI 24-
            301 for additional information on delivery procedures.
            5.3.12.13.1.4. Management Notice. This output will be used to coordinate with
            the customer if a substitute is available for issue.
      5.3.12.14. Deployed Bench Stock. Depending on the MAJCOM, consumables may be
      supported under the Deployable Bench Stock concept, or may be included in readiness
      spares package (RSPs).
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    195


         5.3.12.14.1. These two different approaches dictate different replenishment actions.
         Be aware of these differences and take every effort to aid or assist in the timely
         replenishment of consumables. These represent the majority of bits and pieces,
         attaching parts and hardware. They can be your “bread and butter” in eliminating
         mission capability (MICAPs) and facilitating repair.
         5.3.12.14.2. Deployable Bench Stock is owned by the deploying unit. These assets
         are not on record when deployed nor can they be transferred. In order to keep stock
         on-hand, an RSP detail must be created using the bench stock line number as the
         detail. A good way to do this is by creating a separate shop code (i.e. BS) and then
         using the bench stock review listing to mirror the RSP to the bench stock. Once this is
         done, you can begin ordering bench stock that is at or below 50 percent. Keep in mind
         that if you are deployed overseas it’s highly recommended that you order the
         complete bench stock total to avoid stock outages.
            5.3.12.14.2.1. Items included in the RSP will be ordered under normal procedures
            as they are expensed (used.)
         5.3.12.14.3. Bench Stock Review. Bench Stock should begin immediate review of
         deploying units' bench stock. If it is a short notice deployment (60 days or less), the
         above actions are still advised but must be compressed within the given time.
            5.3.12.14.3.1. Close and continuous coordination with the supported organization
            to check and double check bench stock adds and deletes is essential.
            5.3.12.14.3.2. Initiate priority action to fill bench stocks according to established
            procedures.
            5.3.12.14.3.3. Initiate priority action on bench stock due-out line items that the
            deploying organization identifies as necessary for deployment.
     5.3.12.15. Bin Labels.
         5.3.12.15.1. Bench stock bin labels are produced via the ILS-S upon request. Bin
         labels are automatically produced for new bench stock items and when existing bench
         stock records are changed. Bin labels for items with a shelf life are colored, to
         distinguish those items from non-deteriorating items. See Daily Bin Labels
         (D38/NGV837) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for additional details about bench
         stock label printing options. In some locations, bench stock items are managed by the
         use of automated information technology (AIT) equipment (hand-held terminals) that
         record the information stored on bin labels.
         5.3.12.15.2. Process this report using ES-S. Reference the ES-S User’s Manual on
         the ES-S CoP. The purpose of this report is to provide bin labels for all item record
         warehouse locations, bench stock operations, supply point, equipment, retail sales,
         SPRAM, mission support and war reserve type items.
  5.3.13. Shelf Life Item Control.
     5.3.13.1. Purpose: To explain shelf life procedures process. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
196                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.3.13.2. Shelf life management procedures are contained in DoD 4140.27-M and will be
      followed for stocking, storing and issuing shelf life designated material. Specific
      guidance is given in this chapter and will be used along with DoD 4140.27-M at AF
      activities.
         5.3.13.2.1. Designation. Items assigned a National Stock Number (NSN) in the
         Federal Supply System will be designated by a specific shelf life code. This code
         identifies length of the shelf life period. All NSNs or National Item Identification
         Number (NIINs) not designated as shelf life items in accordance with DoD 4140.27-
         M are considered to be non-deteriorative and, thus, are not managed as shelf life
         items and shall be coded and identified by shelf life code 0 (zero).
      5.3.13.3. Shelf Life Management and Programs.
         5.3.13.3.1. Storage. Shelf life items should be consolidated in one central stockroom
         or warehouse to the maximum extent possible. Consolidation will facilitate
         efficiency during inspection or surveillance actions by reducing the amount of travel
         time between locations. It is not necessary to segregate shelf life items from other
         assets in storage.
             5.3.13.3.1.1. Report any item in storage that appears to be deteriorating and
             excluded from the shelf life control procedures to the responsible item manager to
             evaluate if the item should be assigned a shelf life code.
             5.3.13.3.1.2. Item(s) may be unsuitable for intended use at the expiration of the
             assigned storage time. Users need to ensure not to confuse Shelf Life and Service
             Life. Shelf Life is the time the item sits “on the shelf” prior to issue or after issue
             and not in use. The service life is determined by appropriate TO, Commercial
             Manuals, or other documentation. For example, a tire might have a shelf life code
             of “S” (60 months). This does not mean you replace a “in use” tire every 60
             months. The service life of the tire might be 10 years. If however, the tire has
             been on the shelf for 60 months and has not been used the shelf life code (SLC)
             will apply because requirements in tactical situations when mission success could
             be jeopardized by failure and lives could be lost during combat when assets have
             sat “on the shelf”. Users may challenge any SLC if they feel items are improperly
             coded.
             5.3.13.3.1.3. Identification on Labels. Warehouse personnel must make sure the
             label on each item, subject to shelf life management, clearly states the expiration
             date. Activities using items with short shelf lives are authorized, on an optional
             basis, to use a color-coding system making expiration dates more readily
             apparent. One system is to have two sets of decals like those used on vehicle
             license plates. Each set is a different color to designate the current year and the
             next year. Each color would have decals with numbers from 1 to 12 to designate
             the month of expiration.
                5.3.13.3.1.3.1. Chemical Warfare Defense Equipment (CWDE). Individual
                Protective Equipment assets that qualify for shelf life extension must be
                clearly marked with the latest discard/expiration date and will be clearly
                remarked with new discard/ expiration date. This can be done by marking out
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   197


              the old data and hand writing in new data, or use of DD Form 2477. Note:
              Property previously identified with AF Form 2032, Inspection Extension
              (rescinded) must now be identified using a DD Form 2477. AFTO Form 152,
              Chemical Defense Ensemble Inspection Record/DD Form 1574 to show
              updated extended shelf life is an acceptable method of update. Assets
              "without" a marked discard/expiration date will not require individual
              marking of extended shelf life. Along with the guidance above, Mobility
              Inventory Control and Accountability System (MICAS) will be updated for all
              assets with extension data.
          5.3.13.3.1.4. Zero Balance Procedures. When a unit of issue change results in a
          zero balance because there is an insufficient quantity on hand to show a balance,
          warehouse personnel must get Customer Support to help resolve the problem.
          For example, if the item is critical or in short supply locally, local management
          must decide if adjunct records should be loaded (“-1”, i.e. modify the NSN to
          reflect the appropriate quantity).
       5.3.13.3.2. Maximum Use of Stock. Issues of shelf life stocks should be directed
       against the oldest stocks (those with the least shelf life remaining). Storage activities
       shall initiate controls to minimize expiration of materiel in storage by issuing first
       those stocks which have the earliest expiration date for Type I items; or the earliest
       date manufactured, date packed, date cured, or date assembled for Type II items,
       except where issue of newer stocks is justified. Under normal circumstances, this
       policy prescribes for a strict application of first-in/first-out (FIFO) issue control
       techniques.
          5.3.13.3.2.1. Exceptions. The only exception to this policy is issues (transfers) to
          mission support kit (MSK)/mobility readiness spares package (MRSP)/war
          reserve material (WRM) where the newest stock is released. Under no conditions
          will warehouse personnel issue an item that has reached or passed its expiration
          date. Immediately notify inspection personnel when an item with an expired shelf
          life date is discovered in stock. Inspection personnel will immediately begin a
          complete review of all assets on hand for that stock number.
          5.3.13.3.2.2. Time compliance technical order (TCTO) kits containing shelf-life
          items will be assigned a shelf-life code of the shortest shelf-life item in the kit.
       5.3.13.3.3. Internal Controls. To control items in storage, Inspection personnel do
       the following:
          5.3.13.3.3.1. Query the ILS-S to list the item records for all items assigned shelf
          life codes (See ES-S User’s Manual and/or AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2) for
          additional information on shelf life codes ). This program may also be processed
          to select specific shelf life codes, as required. This option should be used to
          frequently monitor items assigned short shelf life codes.
              5.3.13.3.3.1.1. Physically check each location for the following:
              5.3.13.3.3.1.2. Bin label attached to and matches property in location.
              5.3.13.3.3.1.3. Ensure using first-in/first-out (FIFO) issue control techniques.
198                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             5.3.13.3.3.1.4. Verify shelf life and expiration date.
             5.3.13.3.3.1.5. Ensure items are in original packing with manufacturer label
             for Type I. Type II must have a manufacturer label or DD Form 2477. Note:
             Manufacturer label must be clear and legible.
             5.3.13.3.3.1.6. Color coding bin labels. On an optional basis, warehouse
             personnel can use a color-coding system to making shelf life and expiration
             dates more readily apparent. One system is to have two sets of decals like
             those used on vehicle license plates. Each set is a different color to designate
             the current year and the next year. Each color would have decals with
             numbers from 1 to 12 to designate the month of expiration.
         5.3.13.3.3.2. Annotate the listing to indicate items are outdated or require issue or
         disposition before the next inspection.
         5.3.13.3.3.3. Retain the annotated listing(s) until new products are produced.
      5.3.13.3.4. DoD Shelf Life Program Website. The DoD Shelf Life program has both
      a secure and non-secure website. These sites contain access to the Shelf Life
      Extension System (SLES) and other management information. The secure site is
      available to .mil customers without a password and is located at
      https://headquarters.dla.mil/j-3/shelflife. The non-secure site is located at:
      http://www.shelflife.hq.dla.mil.
      5.3.13.3.5. Quality Status Listing. The Quality Status Listing (QSL) provides
      extension information for Type II Shelf Life materiel that has been tested by DoD and
      General Services Administration (GSA) certified laboratories. The QSL is available
      to “.mil” customers on the SLES secure site. All levels of storage activities may
      utilize the test results in the QSL to extend the shelf life or dispose of specified items
      as indicated. To extend the shelf life based on the test results in the QSL the items on
      hand must equate to the same stock number, contract, lot, and/or batch number as
      listed. The items must be properly stored during the entire shelf life period. Note:
      Since every Type II item cataloged in the ILS-S will not be listed on the QSL at any
      given time the appropriate ICP Shelf Life Point of Contact may be contacted for
      assistance.
      5.3.13.3.6. Shelf-Life Extension System (SLES). The AF will utilize the DLA
      managed SLES program enabling military activities to determine whether shelf-life
      material has been tested by a certified laboratory and extended.
         5.3.13.3.6.1. Acting in the role of AF Executive Agent, the Warner Robins Air
         Logistics Complex shares the responsibility of testing shelf-life items with other
         DoD components and helps assure update and operation of the data in the SLES.
         5.3.13.3.6.2. The data reflects results of test conducted by certified AF Materiel
         Command (AFMC) Physical Science Laboratories to determine if Type II Shelf-
         Life materiel can be extended for use. Test samples are selected from materiel
         stored according to applicable storage standards. The SLES report may be used to
         extend the inspection/test date on all like materiel with the same stock number
         and manufacturer’s lot/batch number provided the materiel has been stored
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   199


            according to applicable storage standards. However, it should be stressed the
            SLES report is advisory and results are determined when the ideal storage
            conditions have been complied with. When using the SLES, remember local
            storage conditions must be taken into consideration prior to extension/disposal
            actions.
     5.3.13.4. Receiving Shelf Life Items. When shelf life items are received they will be
     inspected to be certain the expiration of inspection/test date is accurate.
        5.3.13.4.1. Date Is Not Expired. If the date is not expired, cargo movement
        personnel will sign or stamp block 27 of the DD Form 1348-1A, to verify the shelf
        life date on the tag/label and the paperwork are correct.
        5.3.13.4.2. Date Is Expired. If the inspection/test date is expired, cargo movement
        personnel will take the following actions:
            5.3.13.4.2.1. Type I. Receive expired type I (alpha codes) shelf life XB3 items
            with supply condition code H. Supply condition code H will automatically create
            an unserviceable document to transfer XB3 property to the DLADS. Receive all
            other ERRCs with supply condition code F. Supply condition code F will
            automatically request disposition reporting instructions or create a unserviceable
            shipping document, as applicable.
            5.3.13.4.2.2. Type II (numeric codes).
                5.3.13.4.2.2.1. If the inspection/test date can be extended, extend the date and
                receive the property as serviceable.
                5.3.13.4.2.2.2. If the property requires serviceability check by maintenance,
                after the receipt is processed, follow procedures in Sec. 5B, Order and
                Requisitioning of this manual to issue the property to maintenance.
                5.3.13.4.2.2.3. If the inspection/test date cannot be extended, receive XB3
                items     with     supply     condition     code    H     and    all    other
                Expendability/Recoverability/Reparability/Cost (ERRCs) with supply
                condition code F.
        5.3.13.4.3. Non-NSN Local Purchase Items. Upon receipt of non-NSN local
        purchase items, the inspector will perform normal inspection responsibilities and
        determine if the appropriate shelf-life code is on the ILS-S. The item record shelf-life
        code will be displayed on the local purchase receiving document (block B, print
        position 29, DD Form 1348-1A). If the item received is considered a dated item and
        the shelf-life code on the ILS-S does not apply, the inspector will coordinate with the
        Records Maintenance Unit to load the proper code or will insure the ILS-S is loaded
        with the correct code. DD Form 1574 or DD Form 1574-1, Serviceable Label will be
        applied to outer cartons on all non-NSN local purchase items or on individual items if
        not packed in multiple quantities.
     5.3.13.5. Shelf Life Codes.
        5.3.13.5.1. Assigning Shelf Life Codes. Items assigned shelf life codes are divided
        into categories as follows:
200                                                    AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.3.13.5.1.1. Type I (alpha codes). Type I (alpha codes) are assigned to items
      having a definite, non-extendable shelf life.
         5.3.13.5.1.1.1. Type I shelf life items will not be tested, inspected, or
         extended in storage. These assets will be downgraded from condition codes
         "A," to "B," to "C," to "H," in accordance with the specified condition code
         timeframes located in DoD 4140.27M.
         5.3.13.5.1.1.2. For all shelf life assets other than cure dated items, the
         manufactured date, assembled date, packed date, expiration date, and the
         inspect/test date shall be expressed by the numeric month followed by the last
         two digits of the calendar year, with the day of the month being the last day.
         When two or more unit packs of identical items have different beginning or
         ending shelf-life dates, the earliest ending date, i.e. expiration or inspect/test
         shall be the date used. Note: Example, the date of 12/03 would be December
         2003 and the inspection/expiration date would be the 31st of December 2003.
         The 31st would be the use to date and the item could have a longer service
         date.
      5.3.13.5.1.2. Type II (numeric codes). Type II (numeric codes) are assigned to
      items having a shelf life which may be extended after the completion of
      inspection, testing, or restoration, as appropriate. An item may be extended for
      the full term of its original life unless TOs or other publications prevent it.
         5.3.13.5.1.2.1. For Type II extendible shelf life items, materiel requiring
         visual inspection should be inspected 6 months prior to the inspection test
         date. Materiel requiring laboratory testing shall be tested 9 months prior to
         the inspect/test date, while the item is still in condition code A. Prior to
         testing, the QSL shall be checked to determine if the item has already been
         tested and extended. For materiel requiring laboratory testing which is stored
         at an intermediate or LRS/Materiel Management Activity, the storage activity
         may test materiel locally in a certified lab or contact the managing ICP shelf
         life focal point DoD 4140.27M for a list of approved certified labs. If the
         materiel is inspected/tested while still in condition code A and passes, the
         shelf life will be extended for the full period of the assigned original shelf life.
         During second or subsequent test/inspections, passing items will be extended
         for one-half of the originally assigned shelf life. Thus, an item that is assigned
         shelf life code 6 (24 months) is extended for 24 months after passing the first
         test/inspection and 12 months after passing the second or subsequent
         test/inspection.
           5.3.13.5.1.2.1.1. When submitting Type II shelf life materiel to a testing
           laboratory, it is important that the batch, lot, and contract numbers are
           annotated on all documentation/property that is being sent for testing. This
           requirement applies to materiel from the warehouse that needs to be tested,
           as well as the materiel in depot maintenance support centers. This
           information is required so that the test results reported in the SLES product
           can be used accurately. In cases where the contract number is not available,
           the materiel can still be tested and extended if test parameters are met.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      201


     5.3.13.6. Extensions. For all Type I and II shelf life materiel, the SLC takes precedence
     over the manufacture expiration date. All appropriate marking should reflect the
     expiration date of the SLC assigned unless otherwise directed by the ICP or other shelf
     life agency (For example, if the manufacture states an item will expire in 5 years however
     the SLC states 10 years, the assigned SLC takes precedence).
        5.3.13.6.1. Testing and Inspections.
            5.3.13.6.1.1. Shelf-Life Testing Costs. The basic premise is the organization
            owning the material pays for the testing. If the customer owning the material is
            from another AF Base, another Service, another Agency, etc. they are responsible
            to fund any costs related to the testing of shelf-life assets. If the material is owned
            by a local manufacturing production organization, the testing lab gets paid by the
            expense incurred testing the material being charged back to the organization
            owning the material.
            5.3.13.6.1.2. A complete functional test, including any required disassembly, is
            necessary prior to issue or shipment if the assigned storage time has elapsed. If
            complete functional testing is not required, check required testing in accordance
            with applicable technical order (TO).
            5.3.13.6.1.3. After Type II shelf life materiel is inspected or tested and then
            extended to a new inspection or test date, a DD Form 2477, shall be attached to
            the outside container of each item in a conspicuous place at the storage location.
            5.3.13.6.1.4. Shelf Life Items in Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSPs).
            The responsibility for management and surveillance of shelf-life items maintained
            in the MRSP will be as determined/specified in AFI 23-101, Sec. 2F, Readiness
            Spares and Kits.
            5.3.13.6.1.5. Natural or synthetic rubber components, bearings, lubricants, etc.,
            should be replaced when necessary, as well as any other reconditioning required
            to return the item to a serviceable condition prior to issue or shipment if the
            assigned storage time has elapsed.
            5.3.13.6.1.6. Petroleum Products. Petroleum products are managed IAW with the
            AF Petroleum Office (AFPET) and TO 42B-1-1, and AFI 23-204, Organizational
            Fuel Tanks. Chemicals and chemical products, both packaged and bulk, in FSCs
            6810 (chemicals), 6820 (dyes), and 6850 (miscellaneous chemical specialties)
            supply classes will be inspected visually or retested as specified in TO 42C-1-12.
            All overage chemicals should be reported by letter or message to AFPET.
                5.3.13.6.1.6.1. Contact AFPET at 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Ft. Belvoir,
                VA 22060 for petroleum product retest information or disposition instructions.
                Information can also be obtained through the AF Petroleum Agency via the
                AF Portal.
            5.3.13.6.1.7. Aircraft jet engine oils, MIL-L-7808L, Performance Specification;
            Lubricating Oil, Aircraft Turbine Engine, Synthetic Base and MIL-L-23699, must
            be used within 36 months of the date of packaging or the date of the last test. To
            prevent unnecessary testing, the QSL published by DLA may be used to obtain
202                                                  AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      test data.
          5.3.13.6.1.7.1. Bases maintaining large inventories of aircraft and engine oils
          as WRM may have difficulty rotating stocks in peacetime, when demands are
          low. Accordingly, 12 months before the product's expiration date, bases
          should submit requests for assistance in redistributing stock. AF bases unable
          to rotate stocks adequately may use advice code 2G when requisitioning to
          DLA.
      5.3.13.6.1.8. Containers, Drums, Tanks, Lines, and Associated Equipment. Local
      checklists will be developed to ensure that containers, drums, tanks, lines, and
      associated equipment are inspected monthly. The ILS-S listings or a suitable
      program may be used to assist in these inspections. Checklists will indicate
      specific storage areas where chemicals are stored, location of tanks and lines
      where applicable, and location or serial numbers of associated equipment used in
      the chemical storage operation. The result of the monthly inspections will be
      documented on the checklist and maintained for a minimum of one year.
      5.3.13.6.1.9. XD/XF Assets. All Type II shelf life ERRC designator XD(C/T)
      and XF (P) items must undergo a 100% test or inspection. These items will
      require a bench or functional check to ensure serviceability; therefore all affected
      assets must be checked.
      5.3.13.6.1.10. Critical Supplies. Shelf life items that are in a critical supply
      position will be tested and extended in stock when appropriate; regardless of the
      dollar value of the materiel involved. Item criticality will be determined by
      coordination with the appropriate AF activity with engineering authority assigns
      the shelf life code having responsibility for the item.
      5.3.13.6.1.11. Possession of Shelf Life. Inspections shall be the responsibility of
      the activity having custody of a shelf life item. Units shall be responsible and
      accountable for shelf life inspection on materiel that has been issued to them.
      Supply activities shall be responsible and accountable for shelf life inspection on
      materiel in their possession. The materiel management activity should request
      assistance from a maintenance activity (user) when they need services or advice to
      accomplish the inspection or to evaluate the test results. The following
      procedures will assist with these circumstances:
          5.3.13.6.1.11.1. Process a condition change input to transfer outdated
          serviceable items to unserviceable details when the item is to be issued to
          Maintenance for serviceability check, or there will be a delay in processing
          the item to disposal.
          5.3.13.6.1.11.2. Maintenance personnel will forward written results of their
          test findings and the items not used or consumed in testing.
          5.3.13.6.1.11.3. Maintenance will return items not consumed but tested
          unserviceable. Inspection personnel will process a return for the total quantity
          of the items not consumed but tested unserviceable.
          5.3.13.6.1.11.4. Maintenance will tag those items tested and found
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       203


                serviceable and their expiration dates will be extended according to this
                manual.
                5.3.13.6.1.11.5. Inspection personnel will process a return for the quantity
                used or consumed during testing.
                  5.3.13.6.1.11.5.1. The unserviceable document will be stamped or typed
                  with the following statement: Property Reflected On This Document Has
                  Been Consumed During Routine Testing IAW__________.
                  5.3.13.6.1.11.5.2. The ILS-S document will be signed and dated by the
                  chief inspector or his/her designee and forwarded to Document Control.
                  Attach a copy of the written test results to provide an audit trail.
                  5.3.13.6.1.11.5.3. Items consistently failing to meet test requirements and
                  have been properly stored should be reported to the appropriate Item
                  Management organization for assessment of the assigned shelf life or use of
                  an alternate source of supply.
     5.3.13.7. Processing Outdated Shelf Life Items. Under no conditions will warehouse
     personnel issue an item which has reached or passed its expiration date. Immediately
     notify inspection personnel when an item with an expired shelf life date is discovered in
     stock. Inspection personnel will immediately begin a complete review of all assets on
     hand for that stock number.
        5.3.13.7.1. Type I Shelf Life Items. When type I shelf life items are outdated,
        process a condition change to change the condition to H (condemned) for an
        automatic transfer to DLADS.
        5.3.13.7.2. Type II Shelf Life Items. Type II shelf life items will be tested 15-45
        days before the expiration date. Testing is required when the on-hand balance for the
        affected batch/lot indicates the materiel will remain in stock beyond the expiration.
        Decisions are based on the normal utilization rate and/or demand pattern for the
        affected item. The QSL maintained by DLA under the SLES program will be
        checked before any local testing is initiated. A condition change is not necessary
        unless test results are not received prior to the expiration of shelf life for that batch/lot
        number.
            5.3.13.7.2.1. Processing Type II Expired Shelf Life Items. Process a condition
            change input to change the condition code to J (suspend outdated items on an
            unserviceable detail). Do this when the item is to be issued to maintenance for a
            serviceability test or when there is a delay in processing. Issue unserviceable
            items to maintenance using ILS-S controls for monitoring.
            5.3.13.7.2.2. Test Findings. The Maintenance function forwards a written reply of
            the test finding(s), along with any materiel not used or destroyed in testing, to
            Inspection.
                5.3.13.7.2.2.1. Item Destroyed During Testing. If the item was destroyed as a
                result of testing, Inspection processes a return with supply condition code of H
                and action taken code of 9. This action will generate a transfer document to
                DLADS. Returns are processed using the original issue document numbers to
204                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                 make certain all due-in from maintenance (DIFM) details are deleted.
                   5.3.13.7.2.2.1.1. Stamp, type or hand scribe the following statement on the
                   transfer document: Property Reflected On This Document Has Been
                   Consumed During Routine Testing IAW__________.
                   5.3.13.7.2.2.1.2. The Chief Inspector or designee will sign and date the
                   document before forwarding it to Document Control. A copy of the written
                   test result(s) will be attached to provide an audit trail.
             5.3.13.7.2.3. Tested Unserviceable.      Materiel not consumed but tested
             unserviceable is processed in the same manner as above, but the resulting transfer
             document and the unserviceable item are forwarded to DLADS.
             5.3.13.7.2.4. Tested Serviceable. Items tested and found serviceable are tagged
             and their expiration dates are extended according to instructions in this section.
         5.3.13.7.3. Exception to Type II Shelf Life Testing. When small quantities of the
         same stock number reach their expiration date, the Chief Inspector must determine if
         testing of this material is cost effective. Testing should not be done when the cost of
         the test is greater than the total dollar value of the outdated materiel, or when only
         one unit remains and the materiel will be consumed in testing.
      5.3.13.8. Shipping. Source of Supply activities should utilize the following criteria to
      ensure that shelf life items arrive at their destination with adequate serviceable shelf life
      remaining. Once the Type II materiel is received, it becomes the receiver's (i.e., retail,
      end user) responsibility to inspect the materiel and ensure that extension information is
      available or submit an SDR if information is not current and not available in the QSL.
      Subsequently, the receiver will ensure that extension markings are current and remark
      accordingly.     Costly DLADS/hazardous waste disposal of Type II shelf-life
      items/materiel solely on the basis that the inspect/test date markings on the shipment
      container had lapsed when received would most likely be premature and is unauthorized
      without conducting the appropriate research. Shipping expired shelf-life materiel to any
      customer is prohibited.
         5.3.13.8.1. Continental United States (CONUS) Shipments.
             5.3.13.8.1.1. Items with less than 90 days of shelf life remaining (condition code
             "C") may only be issued for immediate usage -- priority designator 01-08
             requisitions.
             5.3.13.8.1.2. Items with three to six months shelf-life remaining (condition code
             "B") may be shipped to CONUS contractors' facilities for use as government
             furnished property (GFP) or government furnished materiel (GFM) and to other
             CONUS requisitioner's for stock and reissue.
         5.3.13.8.2. Overseas Shipments. All items for overseas shipment, including
         shipments under security assistance programs, will be selected from the newest stock
         (longest remaining shelf-life). The minimum requirements are outlined below. These
         three paragraphs are quoted from DoD 4140.27-M.
             5.3.13.8.2.1. Items with an SLC of 24 months or greater, issued to satisfy either
             overseas or ILP requirements shall be in condition code A, with a minimum of 12
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    205


            months shelf life remaining. Requisitioners may waive the 12-month minimum
            by submitting exception requisitions. Items with an SLC of less than 24 months
            are not subject to the 12-month minimum. However, they must be issued from
            condition code A assets, unless the customer specifies that other than condition
            code a materiel is acceptable. OCONUS requisitions may be identified by
            Document Identifier Codes (DIC) A01, A02, A03, A04, or A05 in record position
            1-3 of the requisition. ILP requisitions are identified by the following Military
            Standard Requisitioning And Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) service codes in
            record position 30: B (Army FMS), D (AF FMS), K (Marine Corps FMS), P
            (Navy FMS), or T (DLA FMS).
            5.3.13.8.2.2. In addition to the above, ILP requisitions will be issued in
            accordance with Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) policy. LIFO issues of Type I shelf
            life items will be accomplished by issue of materiel with the most current date of
            expiration. Type II items will be issued by the most current date of manufacture,
            cured, assembly, or date packed (subsistence only), regardless of exceptions.
        5.3.13.8.3. For AF managed items. Condition Code B materiel may be issued for
        priority 01-08 AF FMS requisitions.”
        5.3.13.8.4. Requisitioners may specify the shipment of only the newest stock to meet
        strategic mission requirements by utilizing Military Standard Requisitioning and
        Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) advice code "2G."
        5.3.13.8.5. The IMMs have the capability to supplement the advice codes indicated
        in the customer's requisition or when instructing storage activities to deviate from the
        FIFO principle by the use of Military Standard Reporting and Accounting Procedure
        (MILSTRAP) management codes. These codes are to be used only to supplement
        information conveyed by the condition code on the materiel release order. The two
        MILSTRAP management codes are defined as follows: Code "T" - Issue newest stock
        only. Code "U" - Issue stock having at least one-year shelf life remaining.
     5.3.13.9. Excess, Disposal and Reutilization of Shelf Life Assets.
        5.3.13.9.1. All AF units shall report all excess on-hand quantities to the Integrated
        Materiel Manager (IMM). All efforts will be made to redistribute potentially expiring
        shelf life assets.
        5.3.13.9.2. Final disposal action should be the absolute last resort for shelf life items
        that have, for example: (1) expired or (2) will not be extended due to visual
        inspection/laboratory test failure       and (3) are not Hazardous Material
        (hazmat)/Hazardous Waste (hw). Using discretion and common sense, in terms of
        Environment, Safety And Occupational Health (ESOH) considerations, there may be
        circumstances where use of these items may be diverted to completely non-critical or
        non-tactical applications as opposed to disposal. Alternative uses should be
        coordinated with ESOH authority and facilities maintenance.
        5.3.13.9.3. Challenging a SLC Assignment. Challenges shall be written, coordinated
        within the challenging service/agency prior to routing to the AF activity with
        engineering authority that assigns the shelf life code, and coordinated with the
        remaining services/agencies prior to service implementation. Because shelf life
 206                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


          assignments are based on optimum storage conditions and the exact rates of
          deterioration or degradation are unknowns, shelf life items must be closely monitored
          and visually inspected prior to use. If the items are still good even where stored
          under adverse conditions, the scenario presents an opportunity to challenge the shelf
          life code assignment.
          5.3.13.9.4. Retail activities will dispose of expired items and redistribute/dispose of
          excess items as needed. When serviceable items become unserviceable due to
          expiration of a shelf life component, a determination will be made as to whether a
          firm or future stock level requirement still exists for the item. If so, the item will be
          tagged with a DD Form 1576 or DD Form 1576-1, Test/Modification Label Materiel
          and forwarded to maintenance for local repair or evacuation.

Section 5D—Equipment Management

5.4. Equipment Management.
   5.4.1. Organizational Visits.
       5.4.1.1. Purpose: To explain the procedural processes to conduct organizational visits.
       For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
       AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
       5.4.1.2. General Discussion: The EAE is responsible for ensuring proper accountability
       of in-use equipment, equipment items are marked with a Unique Item Identifier (UII),
       equipment custodians properly conduct their duties, and squadron commanders are
       provided feedback concerning equipment accountability. The EAE assists unit property
       custodians with equipment issues, perform base level equipment management functions
       and perform scheduled organizational visits. See MIL-STD-130 for IUID instructions.
       Note: MAJCOMS are authorized to modify these instructions for wings with contracted
       or Most Efficient Organization (MEO) LRS’s if organizational visits will significantly
       increase the cost of current contracts or MEO manpower until such contracts are due to
       be competed or renewed. The unit will provide their MAJCOM/A4R with a waiver
       request that includes reason(s) they cannot comply, their proposed alternative method to
       ensure equipment accountability and a projected get well date. MAJCOMs/wings will
       add associated EAE tasks to contracts as they are competed or renewed.
       5.4.1.3. The following actions will be performed:
          5.4.1.3.1. Schedule and conduct annual organizational visits to ensure custodians are
          performing their accountability responsibilities. Document the visit results and
          provide to the squadron commander or responsible officer with recommendations for
          corrective actions. The EAE will check the following areas:
              5.4.1.3.1.1. Ensure accountable equipment items that are verified as directed
              below are marked with a Unique Item Identifier (IUID) and Unique Item
              Identifier (UII) label is serviceable, readable, and associated with the correct
              equipment data within AFEMS.
              5.4.1.3.1.2. Verify accountability of all capital equipment assets and ensure
              documentation is available to support valuation.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   207


            5.4.1.3.1.3. Verify accountability of Nuclear Weapons Related Material
            (NWRM) equipment IAW AFI 20-110.
            5.4.1.3.1.4. Verify accountability of COMSEC/CCI equipment . COMSEC/CCI
            equipment items are defined as equipment and components used to secure official
            communications. These items are identified with Serialized Report Code (SRC)
            "C".
            5.4.1.3.1.5. Spot check a random 10% sample (per account) of the organization’s
            remaining accountable in-use equipment to ensure it is on hand.
            5.4.1.3.1.6. Verify the unit has a process to account for pilferable items
            purchased with the government purchase card. Units can account for pilferable
            assets (i.e., digital cameras, projection equipment) via the use of an
            Organizational Visibility List or locally developed product. Validate that
            equipment items that meet the criteria for accountability on Equipment
            Authorized In-Use Details (EAID) are not accounted for on the Organizational
            Visibility List or locally developed product.
        5.4.1.3.2. Provide the accounts responsible officer, responsible officer’s group and
        wing commander with a written status report of the organizational visit signed by the
        LRS CC/AO. Include on this report, strengths, findings and observations.
        5.4.1.3.3. Review and validate the responsible officer’s replies to the report’s
        findings and determines if the actions taken are sufficient to correct the deficiencies.
        If the discrepancies are not resolved within 30 calendar days, notify the LRS CC/AO,
        the responsible officer’s group and wing commander, in writing.
        5.4.1.3.4. Measure schedule effectiveness to ensure organizational visits are
        completed annually and reported to the LRS CC/AO monthly during how-goes-it or
        equivalent briefings.
  5.4.2. Allowance Standards (AS).
     5.4.2.1. Purpose: To explain AS and their use with Equipment Management. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-
     123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). AS’s are available online in AFEMS. The
     following is guidance for the application of AS’s:
     5.4.2.2. AS’s prescribe the master item in the Interchangeable and Substitute (I&S)
     subgroup.
     5.4.2.3. ERRCD and AS.
        5.4.2.3.1. Generally, only nonexpendable items (ERRCD Nxx) are listed in an AS.
        When expendable items are listed, it is for information purposes only. With the
        exception of WRM equipment items, Equipment Management Code (EMC) “1” items
        are excluded from EAID records and AFEMS reporting.
        5.4.2.3.2. Using commands can substitute expendable items and quantities if desired.
        Exceptions include specialized tools, personal retention and survival items,
        components of bench set components, test measurement diagnostics equipment, and
        WRM.
208                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.4.2.4. End Items for Standby Use. Only in unusual circumstances will end item
      allowances be approved for standby (backup or maintenance attrition) equipment. If
      additional end items are required, coordinate with MAJCOM FAM and CEMO for
      approval.
         5.4.2.4.1. Those requests, which are in direct support of weapon systems or other
         major equipment end item systems, must be validated by the applicable SPM,
         Product Group Manager (PGM), or Materiel Group Manager (MGM) before sending
         them to AFMC Allowance Standard Activity. Justification for this type of
         allowance/authorization must provide sufficient detail to define the need.
      5.4.2.5. AS’s will not include expendable spare parts required for the maintenance,
      assembly, or repair of end items. In certain circumstances, equipment items may be
      required as spare parts to be used in the repair of other major equipment end items. The
      items will be obtained using activity code “P” and the reparable equipment item will be
      turned in to supply.
      5.4.2.6. The BOI in AS’s represents the maximum allowable quantity of a
      nonexpendable item.
         5.4.2.6.1. The AS BOI is authorized by the applicable approval authority when
         substantiated by adequate justification.
         5.4.2.6.2. Allowances should be stated in flexible terms to allow for variables in
         equipment, personnel, and workloads.
         5.4.2.6.3. Organization commanders may exceed the BOI in a non-weapon AS if the
         item is ERRC code NF, BC 9, and use code B (base funded/base support). This
         guidance excludes:
             5.4.2.6.3.1. BC9 items listed in AS 009, 016 (Parts C, D, E, F, G, and H), 410,
             501, 654, and 658.
             5.4.2.6.3.2. Weapon system AS, depot support, controlled items, mobility, WRM,
             and any allowances requiring approval above wing/base level.
      5.4.2.7. AS Support Categories. All AS’s will indicate the end item application grouped
      into specific support categories according to the intended use of the equipment.
         5.4.2.7.1. Category I, Miscellaneous Allowances. These are nonpublished
         Allowance Source Codes (ASC), such as; Special Allowance 041; Retention
         Authority 048, etc.
         5.4.2.7.2. Category II, Special Support. Reflects equipment to support peculiar
         operations, missions or functions, including WRM support. AS’s in this category
         may reflect both standard and nonstandard equipment. The user will review AS’s in
         this category annually to validate the need to continue the requirement and advise the
         AM of the results of the review.
         5.4.2.7.3. Category III, System Support. Reflects equipment to support specific
         aircraft or missile, and is tailored to specific operational and maintenance concepts.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   209


         5.4.2.7.4. Category IV, Facilities Support. Reflects equipment required to support
         normal base and satellite installation functions for such things as food service,
         chaplain, and civil engineers.
         5.4.2.7.5. Category V, Personnel Support. Reflects equipment to support personnel
         in performance of their assigned duties based upon AFSC or job
         classification/description and related functions with respect to specific USAF
         missions.
         5.4.2.7.6. Category VI, Mission Support. Reflects equipment required to support
         common application of organizational and field level maintenance for such things as
         machine, welding, and sheet metal shops.
         5.4.2.7.7. AS Changes. Users may submit change requests when allowances are
         inadequate, excessive, or unsuitable for functions for which prescribed. Change
         requests can be submitted online through the AFEMS (TACR) or manually on AF
         Form 601. Detailed instructions for submitting change requests are contained in AF
         Form 601 Preparation, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Recommendations to change
         an AS preface (or format) must be submitted by letter.
            5.4.2.7.7.1. Change requests from USSOCOM, USCENTCOM, AFMC, and Air
            Force Security Forces Center are forwarded directly to AFMC Allowance
            Standard Activity.
     5.4.2.8. Proposing a new AS. Any activity may develop a new AS to perform a specific
     duty or function. Any level may approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed new AS
     prior to forwarding it to AFMC Allowance Standard Activity for final action.
         5.4.2.8.1. Forward the requests through MAJCOM channels. Include statements of
         evaluation by ERAA with a proposed BOI on the approval.
         5.4.2.8.2. Send one copy to AFMC Allowance Standard Activity for approval.
         5.4.2.8.3. Include the recommended title, purpose, preface, and special information
         in sufficient detail to permit the evaluation of the stated equipment requirements.
         5.4.2.8.4. Include a complete list consisting of the NSN, nomenclature, unit of issue,
         and BOI for each of the proposed items.
         5.4.2.8.5. Explain pertinent data. Include such things as a functional chart, copies of
         directives assigning new or expanded functions, numbers and skills of personnel
         available or required for equipment operation and maintenance, level of maintenance
         to be performed, student load, peacetime and wartime workload.
     5.4.2.9. AS updates. The AFEMS (C001) message board will used to notify all affected
     users of allowance changes/updates. In certain instances, the AFEMS (C001) will
     provide an automated base authorization update (DOC ID XSJ) which will permit the
     updating of the authorized/in-use detail record without human intervention. Non-
     AFEMS users will receive the changes quarterly through CD-ROM.
  5.4.3. Special Allowances.
     5.4.3.1. Purpose: Special Allowances (ASC 041) were established to permit necessary
     deviations for authorizations when a requirement develops for an item or quantity of
210                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      equipment and normal allowance standard coverage is inappropriate or inadequate.
      Special ACRs are subject to the same approval/disapproval authority as AS changes.
      Submit requests for special allowance according to Sec. 5D, Equipment Management.
      For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
      AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
      5.4.3.2. In addition to applicable data specified in Para 5.4.9, cite the peculiar
      circumstances that preclude inclusion of the item in an AS.
      5.4.3.3. The MAJCOM CEMO is the approval authority for base funded (BC 9)
      equipment items. This does not apply to controllable items requiring a higher level for
      approval.
      5.4.3.4. MAJCOM approval allows a base to procure a BC 9 item while, at the same
      time, processing the request for a normal AS add.
      5.4.3.5. All special requests for CP items will be forwarded through command channels
      to the AM for approval.
      5.4.3.6. The provisions above do not apply to USAF medical activities.
      5.4.3.7. The ASC(s) covering the above, and other specific situations, are identified in
      AFEMS. Requisition or retained items that are restricted for authorization, acquisition,
      or possession only need approval of the controlling agency prior to the ASC being
      approved for use. Note: Through the AF Portal, access the AFEMS webpage address is:
      https://www.afems.wpafb.af.mil
  5.4.4. Emergency Contingency Allowances.
      5.4.4.1. Purpose: Emergency Contingency Allowances are applicable in instances of an
      emergency contingency, combat operations, or emergency relief mission where an
      established base cannot provide support and normal allowance coverage is inadequate.
      For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
      AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
      5.4.4.2. The MAJCOM Commander having logistical support responsibility requests
      establishment of an FX account IAW AFI 24-230, Maintaining Air Force DoD Activity
      Address Codes (DODAAC), and authorizes the use of emergency contingency (allowance
      identity ASC 058) to authorize and identify requirements. Advise AFMC Allowance
      Standard Activity each time the contingency allowance procedure is authorized and the
      anticipated scope and level of approval within the MAJCOM. Except for combat
      operations, use ASC 058 only in those instances where the referenced FX account is
      established. To support combat operations, cite ASC 058 for emergency equipment
      authorizations as a place holder for equipment that is transferred. Authorizations are
      driven by what is reflected in the LOGDET based on the UTC in the standard AS to meet
      the MISCAP. Send requests for ASC 058 authorizations for combat operations to the
      parent MAJCOM for approval. The MAJCOM periodically evaluates ASC 058 approved
      authorizations and initiates requests changes to applicable AS, when appropriate.
      5.4.4.3. Upon completing the contingency requirement, request disposition instructions
      from the applicable IM.
  5.4.5. Mobility Equipment (ME) and WRM Allowances.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                211


     5.4.5.1. Purpose: Mobility Equipment (ME) and WRM Allowances provide a means to
     allow equipment for the prescribed purposes of ME and WRM support. Determination of
     items and quantities of equipment to be authorized as ME will be made by the
     coordination with (FAM) and pilot unit based on applicable allowance documents and
     also the consideration of equipment which is to be prepositioned as WRM and/or
     available as joint-use at the deployment base. For policy specific requirements review
     AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3
     (AFEMS).
     5.4.5.1.1. During the development stages of new Weapon Systems AS’s (WSAS), items
     required to support the weapon system during mobility contingencies are identified and
     included in the WSAS. The FAM will identify general-purpose equipment required to
     support a mobility tasking and coordinate with CEMO to incorporate these requirements.
        5.4.5.1.2. Changes to WSAS and non-WSAS will be coordinated             through the
        MAJCOM, which has approval/disapproval authority.
        5.4.5.1.3. Air Force policy dictates that active duty and reserve forces units tasked
        with the same Unit Type Code (UTC) requirements will be similarly equipped so that
        they can be used interchangeably. To achieve this goal, ME required to meet the
        wartime tasking of reserve forces must be identified by the gaining MAJCOM in
        coordination with ANG, AFRC, and AFMC Allowance Standard Activity.
        5.4.5.1.4. When adequate authorization criteria is published or has otherwise been
        provided to the AO by CEMO to permit base level determinations of items and
        quantities of equipment to be authorized as ME, submission of AF Form 601, etc. for
        command level approval is not required.
        5.4.5.1.5. All equipment to support a UTC will be on-hand, on-order, or contained
        in appropriate budget documents if not centrally procured. AF/A4LM must approve
        exceptions to this policy.
        5.4.5.1.6. WSAS/non-WSAS is the only basis for the authorization and procurement
        of ME. In no case will equipment items be placed in Unit Type Code logistics detail
        (LOG-DET) without a WSAS/non-WSAS authorization.
     5.4.5.2. War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Allowances.
        5.4.5.2.1. WRM allowances and authorizations are based on formal wartime tasking
        in the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 3, as determined by
        agreement between AF/A5X and the appropriate MAJCOM operational OPR.
        5.4.5.2.2. Detailed instructions regarding policy, allowances and accounting for
        WRM is contained in AFI 23-101, Sec. 5D, Equipment Management.
  5.4.6. Deployment and Transfer of Equipment.
     5.4.6.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures for the transfer and deployment of
     equipment. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
     5.4.6.2. General Discussion: Transfer of accountability will be the primary method to
     move equipment. Movement of all equipment in support of contingency, humanitarian, or
212                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      disaster relief operations will be accomplished using transfer procedures in the ILS-S or
      AFEMS. Note: The primary method to move equipment for ANG and AFRC will be to
      deploy not transfer. Transfer of ANG and AFRC equipment can only occur when the
      ANG/AFRC CEMOs have determined that it is excess to their needs. Excess ANG and
      AFRC equipment will follow transfer procedures. Transfer of ANG and AFRC
      equipment that is not excess can only be transferred if DoDI 1225.06, Para. 4e, Encl. 3,
      Para. 2, Equipping the Reserve Forces; AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning; and AFH
      10-416, Personnel Readiness and Mobilization are complied with first. Additionally, at
      least 45 days prior to initiating ANF/AFRC equipment transfers, gaining MAJCOMs will
      provide a replacement plan to AF/A4LE for staffing and subsequent approval with the
      SECDEF through the Asst. SECDEF for Reserve Affairs (ASD (RA)). AF/A4LE will
      forward the approved plan and proposal for withdrawal, diversion ,k or reduction for
      equipment to the ANG/AFRC CEMO’s.
      5.4.6.3. Perform the following actions:

          deployments.
          5.4.6.3.3.3. Conduct an inventory with the deploying custodian prior to the
          movement of assets to identify assets to deploy or transfer.
          5.4.6.3.3.4. Ensure all assets are in serviceable condition and have identification
          labels prior to deployment.
          5.4.6.3.3.5. Either create a deployment/transfer package in AFEMS or forward a
          list of NSNs, details and quantities from the deploying account to EAE or AFMC
          SCM-R Equipment Activity for deployment/transfer processing. Process separate
          packages for each deploying function, i.e., civil engineering, security forces,
          aircraft maintenance, etc.

             equipment IAW AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for EAID Accountability
             Transfer (Inline) - 1ET; Equipment/WRM Deployment Select (FME) Input
             (Group Selection); and Equipment/WRM Receipt/Transfer Input (FED)
             transaction processing instructions. If the custodian has AFEMS access, assist
             with the creation of the deployment/transfer package.
               5.4.6.3.5.6.2.1. If the transfer is from one base account to another on the
               same base, the transfer will result in an out-of-balance condition at the
               losing account. This will result in an automatic backfill. To rectify this
               situation, prior to transfer, process a replacement issue with transaction
               exception code “H” to suppress automatic requisition. Immediately upon
               return of asset from deployment, cancel the replacement issue (backorder).
               Note: Transfer vehicles BEFORE other items on the same custody account
216                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


              to prevent rejects. Use only valid Routing Identifiers (RIDs). Do not use
              RID “XXX”. The use of RID “CLS” (classified) is authorized and will be
              kept to an absolute minimum and only to identify true classified locations.
             5.4.6.3.5.6.3. Ensure all listings/accountable documents are signed and in
             possession of the deploying custodian prior to departure. Instruct the
             custodian to hand-carry listings/documents to the gaining location.
             5.4.6.3.5.6.4. Manage Overdue Return Notices. If deployed assets have not
             returned within 30 days of deployment termination date, EAE will coordinate
             with the equipment custodian to determine the status of the deployment and
             rectify existing details. May develop local scripts to identify assets 30 days
             overdue. Note: AFEMS only produces Overdue Return Notices when the
             accountability remains with the host LRS CC/AO.
             5.4.6.3.5.6.5. Upon return of deployed property to home base, assist the
             custodian with conducting an inventory after processing all documentation.
             5.4.6.3.5.6.6. Prepare the inputs necessary to remove the deployment
             indicator, subtract the appropriate quantities from the deployed quantities and
             add it to the on-hand quantity. Assets deployed using the group selection
             option, should be returned from deployment using the same selection criteria.
             Note: Do not remove the deployed indicator until the deployed quantity is
             reduced to zero.
      5.4.6.3.6. The Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron (ELRS) will:
         5.4.6.3.6.1. Assume responsibility of all equipment and transactions processed
         against the owning SRAN, to include all equipment and transactions from tenant
         units and/or satellite accounts.
         5.4.6.3.6.2. EEAE will identify deployed equipment custodians at the time of
         their debarkation and obtain a copy of the deployment listing/shipping
         documentation. This is to ensure all assets are physically received at the gaining
         location.
         5.4.6.3.6.3. Create jacket file/folders for all equipment accounts added to the
         owning SRAN.
         5.4.6.3.6.4. Assist deployed custodians with identifying, inventorying, and
         assuming accountability for all equipment under their responsibility.
         5.4.6.3.6.5. Contact AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity to initiate accountability
         via Equipment Receipt Input (FED) transactions IAW AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
         Ch 5.
         5.4.6.3.6.6. Upon notification of deployment termination, assist custodians with
         inventorying equipment and forward all pertinent shipping information to the
         home station owning custodian and EAE.
         5.4.6.3.6.7. Contact AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity to transfer accountability
         back to home station. Using EAID Accountability Transfer (1ET) procedures. See
         AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    217


            5.4.6.3.6.8. Ensure all listings/accountable documents are signed and in the
            possession of the returning deployed custodian prior to departure.
        5.4.6.3.7. The AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity will:
            5.4.6.3.7.1. When notified of deployment, process transfers, loans, or
            redistribution orders as directed by CEMO using EAID Accountability Transfer
            (1ET) IAW AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
            5.4.6.3.7.2. Assist EAE/owning custodian with establishing or obtaining gaining
            account information to facilitate the transfer.
            5.4.6.3.7.3. Process Equipment Receipt Input (FED) transactions for all assets
            transferred or as directed by CEMO. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for
            processing instructions.
            5.4.6.3.7.4. Initiate tracking of shipment suspense details (99S) for equipment
            assets until accountability is established. Utilize a DISCOVERER script to
            identify delinquent 99Ss. Process a CTH inquiry on the NSN to determine if an
            FED was processed with an erroneous shipment document number. If processed
            in error, delete the 99S.
            5.4.6.3.7.5. Contact the gaining custodian if deletion of 99S does not occur to
            determine if the asset was received. If asset was received, the gaining custodian
            should submit the FED request through EAE resulting in establishment of
            accountability and deletion of 99S. If carrier cannot provide evidence of delivery,

     will be authorized and accounted for on EAID records maintained by the AO. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-
     123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
     5.4.10.2. The EAID constitutes the authorization, accounting, and reporting record for
     both host and tenant units supported by the AO. Except for AFMC Air Logistics
     Complexes Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) facilities, acquisition of base funded
     or AFMC centrally procured equipment will not be issued prior to authorization approval.
     Equipment authorizations will be documented as follows:
        5.4.10.2.1. Current Authorizations. Consists of all equipment authorized in-use
        and/or in-place within an organization and maintained on EAID records.
        5.4.10.2.2. Forecast Authorizations.      Forecast authorizations are used to
        systematically plan, develop, and report projected equipment requirements for CP
        items (forecast records for base funded items will be at MAJCOM option).
        Requirements will be forecast as far in advance as possible. Detailed instructions
        concerning forecasting are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 3, Ch 4, Development of
        Forecast Authorization Records.
        5.4.10.2.3. Authorizations are coded in EAID records to indicate the type of
        authorization and/or intended utilization as follows:
            5.4.10.2.3.1. Mobility Equipment (ME). Items and quantities of equipment
            required to be moved with a unit or special activity upon deployment to an

     policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
     AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
     5.4.11.2. General Discussion: Prior to withdrawing or requisitioning equipment from
     DLADS, the requesting organization must comply with procedures that outline
     equipment authorizations and have a valid equipment authorization established.
222                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.4.11.3. Preparatory Actions for DLADS Withdrawals:
         5.4.11.3.1. When practicable, the EAE and AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity shall
         obtain technical advice and recommendations from functional experts prior to
         approval/disapproval of any equipment authorization request for equipment being
         withdrawn from DLADS.
         5.4.11.3.2. The EAE and AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity can
         approve/disapprove changes within an allowance standard and disapprove changes
         that exceed the allowance standard. Approved recommended changes to an allowance
         standard will be input into the AFEMS using the TACR and include
         recommendations/evaluators comments. The TACR will be forwarded to the next
         evaluator. For supported tenant units of other commands, the AFEMS will forward
         the request to the parent command of the tenant unit.
         5.4.11.3.3. Input into AFEMS all requests to change allowance standards or special
         allowance for HQ USAF controlled items. The AFEMS will forward the request to
         the parent MAJCOM for approval and submission to the appropriate allowance
         manager. Note: Submit special weapons allowance change requests to the Prime Item
         Manager.
      5.4.11.4. DLADS Withdrawal Procedures for Equipment Items.
         5.4.11.4.1. Before accountable equipment items can be withdrawn from DLADS, a
         valid allowance standard or authorization supporting the equipment must exist. This
         authorization requirement also includes unserviceable equipment items which will be
         repaired by the customer and used for their original purpose. Any vehicle equipment
         asset withdrawals must be coordinated with the MAJCOM Vehicle Management
         Staff IAW AFI 24-302.
            5.4.11.4.1.1. If the authorization is not established, Equipment Management
            personnel process accountable items using equipment transfer (FED) transaction
            procedures.
            5.4.11.4.1.2. If the authorization and customer due-out are already established in
            the ILS-S for the item, cancel the existing due-out and reestablish it with TEX H.
            5.4.11.4.1.3. If equipment transfer (FED) procedures are used, Customer Support
            prepares a DD Form 1348-1A requisition (A0*) document using an offline
            requisition document number to withdraw the item from DLADS. Clearly mark
            the requisition (A0*) document “Do Not Post” and attach it to the FED document.
         5.4.11.4.2. Non-accountable individual equipment items withdrawn from DLADS to
         fill a valid authorization for individual/organizational clothing (ASC 016), are
         processed through the retail materiel management Individual Equipment function, if
         this function is not contracted out.
         5.4.11.4.3. Unserviceable equipment withdrawals. Equipment authorizations are not
         required for unserviceable equipment items withdrawn from DLADS which will not
         be repaired, or used for their original purpose by the customer. In this case, the
         customer provides the LRS/Materiel Management Activity a signed statement by the
         organizational commander or designated representative. This statement certifies the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       223


        unserviceable equipment item will not be repaired or used for its original purpose.
        Customer Support personnel review the signed statement to ensure necessary
        approval is obtained prior to processing the withdrawal. The customer should retain a
        copy of the approval as authority to retain the unserviceable equipment item without
        accountability. The statement may be submitted by letter or typed on the DD Form
        1348-1A requisition (A0*) document by Customer Support and will read as follows,
        “I certify this item will not be repaired, is not to fill a valid authorization, and will not
        be used for its original, intended purpose.”
        5.4.11.4.4. Re-identification of equipment items. Equipment items obtained for
        purposes other than what they were intended must be re-identified for the
        LRS/Materiel Management Activity. A local L-serialized stock number will be
        assigned with the original stock number loaded in the nomenclature field.
        Additionally, these items will be assigned an ERRCD NF1 to these items and the unit
        price of one penny (.01) will be loaded. For example, a withdrawal of condemned
        flight suits to perform paint details.
  5.4.12. Allowance Source Code (ASC) Listing.
     5.4.12.1. Purpose: To explain the procedural process for review and validation of
     allowance source codes. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
     specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
     5.4.12.2. General Discussion: AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity and/or the EAE use
     the ASC listing to ensure that equipment authorizations are within required allowance
     standards, units are requesting minimum quantities of equipment and the Allowance
     Source Code (ASC) applies to the requestor.
     5.4.12.3. Perform the following actions:
        5.4.12.3.1. Validate all special allowance flags annually in August and obtain the
        certifying official’s signature. MAJCOM may assign this duty to the EAE. Upon
        certification, any pre-approved AF Forms 601 may be destroyed if the option for a
        certified listing is used.
        5.4.12.3.2. Review authorizations to determine if they require an elevated level of
        approval authorization. If elevated level of approval is required, prepare TACR in
        AFEMS. Note: In instances where approval authority for items currently prescribed
        in allowance standards is later elevated, those authorizations which already exist do
        not require retroactive higher level approval unless action is directed by that authority
        through the allowance standard manager.
        5.4.12.3.3. Review all ASCs at least annually and annotate the ASC Listing with
        changes/actions. During ASC reviews, as a minimum, examine the following:
            5.4.12.3.3.1. Special allowances 048,054, and 063. Ensure supporting
            documentation is on file. Note: As 048 is not authorized for NWRM equipment.
            5.4.12.3.3.2. Duplication of requirements. Research using organization citing
            same NSN, allowance standard (AS), part, section, subsection and column against
            multiple equipment records and validate total authorized quantity against the basis
            of issue.
224                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             5.4.12.3.3.3. Multiple components and interchangeable substitute (ISG)
             relationships. Verify that bench mock-ups and other multiple and component ISG
             relationship-s bare authorized within the allowance standard or technical order.
             5.4.12.3.3.4. Compare mobility (A), base use (B), joint use (C) and war reserve
             material (D) use codes on Equipment Authorization Inventory Data/Document
             (EAID) records against authorizations in AFEMS .
             5.4.12.3.3.5. Verify unsuitable and/or unsatisfactory substitutes with D043
             relationships and/or AFEMS basis of issue narrative.
  5.4.13. Equipment Authorization and On Hand Balance Reconciliation.
      5.4.13.1. Purpose: To explain the procedural process for review and correction of
      equipment out of balance conditions, quantity errors, and Allowance Source Code 000
      excess equipment. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
      specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
      5.4.13.2. The Equipment Authorization and On Hand Balance Reconciliation compares
      the authorized quantity with the in-use and due-out quantity. Process the list quarterly

         5.4.15.3.4. Remote Prepositioned Satellite Materiel Management CA/CRL accounts.
         Personnel assigned to the prepositioned site are rotated at a frequency which may
         make normal CA/CRL procedures impractical. A satellite Equipment Management is
         usually established to manage satellite equipment; however, a single custodian may
         be used if there are not enough management actions to justify a separate function. Be
         aware that the single custodian concept cannot be used without AF/A4LE approval.
         In addition, if the single custodian concept is being used when an activity is given
         satellite status, AF/A4LE must give approval before conversion to a separate
         Equipment Management. Note: MAJCOM or theatre LRS/Materiel Management
         Activity’s will also concur on the use of these procedures.
             5.4.15.3.4.1. Change of custodian. Follow the procedures in Para 5.4.15.3.2 for
             a change in AOs. Exceptions to this must comply with Para 5.4.15.3.4

NEXT REVIEW DUE:


  5.4.18. Establishment/Termination of EAID Accountability.
      5.4.18.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures to establish or terminate accountability for
      EAID assets. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
      guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
      5.4.18.2. General Discussion: This section explains when to use the transactions to
      establish and terminate equipment accountability.     Note: Transactions to establish,
      transfer and terminate accountability for NWRM equipment are not authorized and must
      be coordinated through the Nuclear Transaction Control Center (NTCC).
      5.4.18.3. Caution: Extreme care must be taken when you process termination inputs.
      Programs to perform a record reversal and correction of a termination input do NOT
      exist. If an error is made, you must take the following action: Prepare an input to
      establish authorized/in-use detail record using the original document number and the base
      SRAN. Correct and reprocess any rejected inputs. The same procedures apply when a
      transaction to establish EAID accountability is processed in error: Prepare input to
      terminate accountability using the original document number and the base SRAN.
      Correct and reprocess any rejected inputs. .
      5.4.18.4. Perform the following actions:
          5.4.18.4.1. Use Termination and EAID Establishment transaction procedures when
          financial records are NOT to be updated to accomplish the following tasks:
             5.4.18.4.1.1. Establish EAID accountability:
             5.4.18.4.1.2. Buying equipment being rented by USAF.
             5.4.18.4.1.3. Items provided by a contractor as part of a facility project.
             5.4.18.4.1.4. Initial load of a satellite.
             5.4.18.4.1.5. Items withdrawn from DLADS.
             5.4.18.4.1.6. Items previously dropped because of changes in Equipment

          5. Note: Using Establish/Terminate accountability procedures in this section is
          Exception processing.
          5.4.18.4.4.2. AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity or EAE must process the
          transactions (rather than other flights or elements such as Receiving or Pick-up
          and delivery) and has the following responsibilities:
              5.4.18.4.4.2.1. Review equipment being processed to determine output
              documents, signatures required, etc. In many cases, this documentation may
              not require property to be moved.
              5.4.18.4.4.2.2. Input Establish/Termination transactions through any input
              terminal.
238                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                 5.4.18.4.4.2.3. Process the output.
                 5.4.18.4.4.2.4. AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity will provide justification
                 to the EAE who will write the justification on all termination output
                 documents to explain why accountability ended (for example, return of rental
                 items to vendor; return of asset loaned to USAF from other government
                 agencies).
                 5.4.18.4.4.2.5. EAE will ensure documents are annotated, signed, and
                 forwarded to Document Control within 5 working days.
                  5.4.18.4.4.2.5.1. The equipment custodian or the LRS Materiel
                  Management Officer must sign all Establish/Terminate output documents.
                  The LRS Materiel Management Officer may delegate authority to the
                  Equipment Management Supervisor to sign the output documents during
                  his/her absence.
  5.4.19. Processing of Errors from AFEMS.
      5.4.19.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures to process and correct errors, rejects, and
      variances. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
      guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
      5.4.19.2. General Discussion: The AFEMS provides automated transactions which
      allow the ILS-S to update their database without human intervention in most cases. These
      transactions are intended to reduce variance and reject conditions by eliminating manual
      reviews and record updates. The AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity will be notified of
      variances via email notices that are sent as errors are found..
      5.4.19.3. Perform the following actions:
         5.4.19.3.1. To determine mismatches and error notices, log into AFEMS and select
         email from the main menu.
             5.4.19.3.1.1. Upon determining the corrective action for an error, delete the
             error suspense by logging on to the AFEMS, selecting data transactions from the
             Main Menu and retrieve the error record using an AFEMS online transaction.
         5.4.19.3.2. Email notices sent to the AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity require
         immediate action. AFEMS terminal users MUST log on daily to the AFEMS to see if
         email notices or output products are awaiting their action.
             5.4.19.3.2.1. The following basic research points need to be emphasized when
             corrections are being made.
                 5.4.19.3.2.1.1. Check the ILS-S database records for completeness and
                 accuracy.
                 5.4.19.3.2.1.2. Review the reject error report and email notices to determine
                 the appropriate corrective action IAW AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5,
                 Equipment Transaction Report Edits.
                 5.4.19.3.2.1.3. Determine whether incorrect entries caused the error.
                 5.4.19.3.2.1.4. Contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity,
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 239


                Supply Control Center to determine whether a suspected ILS-S ADS
                programming problem could be causing a recurring reject.
  5.4.20. Fixed Ground Communications-Electronics (C-E) Equipment (AS 654).
     5.4.20.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures used to acquire and account for fixed
     ground communications-electronic (C-E) equipment in allowance standard 654. For
     policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
     AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
     5.4.20.2. Fixed ground C-E equipment is non-tactical, which means it is not moved from
     a location for tactical deployment. C-E equipment includes all radio, wire, and any other
     means used for the electrical and visual transmission and reception of information or
     messages in the clear or by cryptographic means; radar and radiation aids to Air Traffic
     Control, navigation, enemy aircraft warning and interception; electronic weather
     equipment, electronic countermeasure devices, and related electronic systems and
     equipment.
     5.4.20.3. Perform the following actions:
        5.4.20.3.1. Submit AF Form 601 to EAE or AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity after
        the equipment has been installed. Initial requirements are generally pushed to base
        level as part of a communications-computer systems (C-CS) installation project or
        procured through a contract. Note: AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity will establish
        an equipment detail record and generate a requisition for initial requirements only
        when 1) the local CSRD is the approval authority, 2) the technical solution can be
        determined locally, and 3) the required item is a budget code 9 or Z item.
            5.4.20.3.1.1. Normal equipment processing procedures apply for replacement of
            installed fixed ground C-E equipment.
            5.4.20.3.1.2. Some fixed ground C-E end item equipment contains components
            which are NF/ND and are not carried on separate details. Issue replacements for
            these nonexpendable components by using activity code P.
        5.4.20.3.2. Maintain on accountable EAID records all end items (ERRC NF/ND)
        specifically identified as major items in a project package. For example, an AN/GPN-
        22 installed as a fixed facility may be made up of individual radar scopes or radios
        that are ERRC NF/ND; however, only the highest stock number assembly is
        accounted for on an in-use detail.
        5.4.20.3.3. Equipment not requiring EAID Accountability.
            5.4.20.3.3.1. Nonexpendable components of a major end item.
            5.4.20.3.3.2. Government-owned, contractor-operated C-E equipment when the
            terms of the contract do not require the contractor to report under AFEMS.
            5.4.20.3.3.3. Real property C-E items in FSC 5410 and 5445. Accountability of
            these FSCs is with BCE. Some FSC 5410 and 5445 items are not real property
            and EME should check with BCE before coding as real property.
        5.4.20.3.4. ASC 654 equipment will be custody receipted to the organization
        possessing the fixed ground equipment (the using/operating agency). Equipment
240                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         installed at unmanned sites will be custody receipted to the AF organization tasked
         with maintenance responsibility.
         5.4.20.3.5. Establish accountability for Fixed Ground C-E (AS 654) provided
         through a contract by submitting an AF Form 601 to the AFMC SCM-R Equipment
         Activity after the equipment is installed. Cite the approved IT/NSSRD or PMD
         number and the coordination of the base level communications-computer systems (C-
         CS) program manager in the justification and item description block. Attach a copy of
         the DD Form 250, Material Acceptance and receiving Report.
      5.4.20.4. Leased or Rented Fixed Ground C-E Equipment require EAID accountability if
      the lease is for more than 12 months. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, Equipment
      Receipt Input (FED) for additional processing instructions.
         5.4.20.4.1. Establish accountability by initiating AF Form 601 and attach a copy of
         the lease/rental agreement (or refer to the agreement) as authority to enter items on
         EAID records. Include the approved IT/NSSRD or PMD number and coordination of
         the base C-CS program manager in the justification and item description block.
         5.4.20.4.2. Establish EAID records for leased/rented equipment based on the highest
         assembly or system that will identify the equipment being leased or rented.
         5.4.20.4.3. Establish authorized in use detail records with equipment code “R” and
         accounting and finance code “RENT”.
      5.4.20.5. If equipment is not stock listed assign a P number and submit for cataloguing
      action.
      5.4.20.6. Establish accountability for fixed C-E equipment Found On Base (FOB) by
      submitting AF Form 601.
         5.4.20.6.1. Enter the approved IT/NSSRD or PMD number in the justification and
         end item block.
         5.4.20.6.2. If there is not an approved IT/NSSRD or PMD on file in the local
         communications unit, the AF Form 601 will have to be validated and approved by the
         Communications Squadron Commander.
         5.4.20.6.3. Inventory adjustment procedures will be used to initiate accountability.
      5.4.20.7. Special Instructions for Telephone Switches.
         5.4.20.7.1. Digital switches (other than DMS 100 digital switches) will be accounted
         for by P numbers loaded as substitute/multiple components for the prime number.
         5.4.20.7.2. Manual switches are accounted for by part number.
      5.4.20.8. Changes to Fixed Ground C-E Equipment require the submission of an
      IT/NSSRD approved by the applicable authority (Base, MAJCOM, Air Staff, etc.). Once
      approved, input the TACR in to AFEMS.
      5.4.20.9. Notify EAE immediately of any modifications have been made that change the
      identity of the fixed C-E equipment. Update the authorized/in-use details by submitting
      an AF Form 601 with a copy of applicable supporting documentation.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                241


  5.4.21. Communications Security/Controlled Cryptographic Item (COMSEC/CCI)
  Equipment.
     5.4.21.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures on how to requisition and account for
     COMSEC/CCI equipment. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for
     IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
     5.4.21.2. There are three categories of COMSEC/CCI equipment: airborne, deployable,
     and fixed.

              shipment to the USAF Marksmanship School for maintenance will be shipped
              and returned to the master shooter when received from the school on
              accountable documentation.
       5.4.24.3.10. Demilitarization.
248                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.4.24.3.10.1. SA/LWs for Demilitarization or Destruction. SA/LWs must be
         demilitarized or destroyed according to the following procedures:
             5.4.24.3.10.1.1. The IM must authorize the demilitarization or destruction of
             all SA/LW.
             5.4.24.3.10.1.2. EAE must process a Non-Directed Transfer to DLADS to
             adjust accountable records, after authorization to demilitarize or destroy is
             granted.
             5.4.24.3.10.1.3. A Weapon Control Report transaction to applicable materiel
             management system (SA Registry) with transaction code V will be generated
             under program control.
      5.4.24.3.11. SA/LWs Using Code V. Demilitarized SA/LWs using code V and
      retained for training, ceremonial, or other purposes must be processed according to
      the following procedures:
      5.4.24.3.12. SA/LWs must be re-identified to a different stock number (NSN),
      assigned a controlled item code N, safeguarded, and reported to the applicable
      materiel management system.
      5.4.24.3.13. The applicable Materiel Management Activity is responsible for
      updating the DoD Central Registry.
      5.4.24.3.14. SA/LWs Abandoned, Claimed, Found-On-Base, and Confiscated.
             5.4.24.3.14.1.1. SA/LWs Abandoned, Claimed, Found-On-Base,                  and
             Confiscated should be reported according to the following guidelines:
               5.4.24.3.14.1.1.1. Before abandoned, confiscated, etc., SA/LWs can be
               registered in applicable materiel management system , the AFMC SA/LW
               Function must check the AF and DoD-wide registry to see if the SA/LW is
               registered.
               5.4.24.3.14.1.1.2. If the SA/LW is registered with the AF, then the small
               arm should be reported by normal reporting procedures.
               5.4.24.3.14.1.1.3. If the SA/LW is not registered with the AF, then it will be
               registered immediately when the SA/LW comes under government control.
               5.4.24.3.14.1.1.4. The document to establish accountability should contain
               the following two statements: condition under which the SA/LW was
               obtained, i.e., lost, found-on-base, confiscated; a notation will also be made
               to indicate the completion of DoD-wide registration and reutilization
               screening.
         5.4.24.3.14.2. Excess SA/LW, regardless of dollar value, must be reported.
             5.4.24.3.14.2.1. Non-appropriated-funded SA/LW turned in to a DLADS and
             privately-owned SA/LWs classified as claims property will be registered
             immediately when they come under the control of DoD. SA that are claimed
             (private property whose title has passed to DoD as a result of a claim against
             the government due to its damage in connection with government activities,
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                249


             usually movement of household goods) or confiscated (private property whose
             title has passed to the DoD as a result of being confiscated by appropriate
             authority, usually as a result of being abandoned and/or unauthorized for
             personal possession) by DoD activities will be reported immediately to
             Component Registries, i.e., AF is the applicable materiel management system.
             Contact the AFMC SA/LW Function SA equipment specialist.
       5.4.24.3.15. Captured SA/LW.
          5.4.24.3.15.1. Special procedures for captured SA/LW.
          5.4.24.3.15.2. Caution: Personnel involved with managing SA must be familiar
          with AFI 31-101 before using information in this section. Also, AFJI 31-217,
          Control and Registration of War Trophy and War Trophy Firearms, outlines
          some of the joint service responsibilities regarding war trophies.
          5.4.24.3.15.3. Special procedures apply for accountability of captured SA/LW.
             5.4.24.3.15.3.1. All AF SA/LW that are currently on hand but not registered
             in the applicable LRS/materiel management system and all those captured in
             the future are subject to the following guidance:
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.1. Ensure all SA/LW are safeguarded IAW AFI 31-101.
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.2. Immediately enter information on captured weapons into
               the applicable materiel management system using stock number
               “1005PCAPTURE.” The model number should be added to the end of the
               stock number to identify the weapon (e.g., 1005PCAPTUREM9,
               1005PCAPTUREAK47), utilizing no more than four characters.
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.3. Identify in writing, to their parent MAJCOM, the type of
               SA/LW complete with description, quantity, serial number, and intended
               purpose.
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.4. MAJCOMs will provide disposition instructions. In the
               meantime, bases must retain these assets using ASC 054CAPT. Disposition
               will consist of 1 of 3 different scenarios:
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.5. If the SA/LW/small arm is intended for display purposes,
               it must be approved through the AF Historian IAW AFI 84-103, USAF
               Heritage Program, Ch 8.
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.6. If assets could be used to support mission requirements if
               approved by MAJCOM.
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.7. If captured     the   most    probable   fate   will    be
               disposal/demilitarization.
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.8. If not approved for display or to fill mission
               requirements, units and LRS/Materiel Management Activity must ensure
               that disposal of captured SA be IAW DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel
               Disposition Manual, Ch 4.
               5.4.24.3.15.3.1.9. SA/LW that survives DLADS screening will be
250                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                   destroyed. If the local DLADS has expanded demilitarization authority and
                   there are less than 10 SA/LW, the DLADS will generally accomplish the
                   demilitarization. Otherwise the DLADS will give instructions for shipping
                   the SA/LW to a demilitarization facility. If the MAJCOM authorizes
                   shipment of the SA/LW to another location for demilitarization, the losing
                   unit will input the shipping transaction while the gaining unit input the
                   proper demilitarization instructions into applicable materiel management
                   system. Note: If the shipment is to the Anniston Army Depot, funding will
                   be required to have the SA/LWs demilitarized.
                   5.4.24.3.15.3.1.10. ASC 054CAPT will be used for captured SA/LW
                   awaiting disposition from MAJCOM.
                   5.4.24.3.15.3.1.11. File Maintenance. All SA/LW controlled by serial
                   number must be assigned a valid NSN or service stock number (NC/ND).
                   Records Maintenance must submit AF Form 86, when required.
  5.4.25. Forecasting New Equipment Requirements.
      5.4.25.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures to forecast new equipment requirements.
      For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to
      AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
      5.4.25.2. Forecasting is necessary to support future organizations changes, future fielding
      of new or modified weapon/support systems, Special Training Equipment Program
      (STEP) requirements, WRM changes, and ME changes.
      5.4.25.3. The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU CEMO will perform the following:
         5.4.25.3.1. Ensure the accurate and timely forecasting of future requirements are
         noted in the classified equipment requirements computation system.
         5.4.25.3.2. Ensure forecast authorization equipment data only contains those items
         indicated as nonexpendable by assignment of expendability, recoverability,
         reparability category (ERRC) code of “S” or “U” in the applicable weapon/support
         system ASs. Note: Do not include expendable items, including those contained in the
         AS, in the forecasts submitted by the owning MAJCOM.
         5.4.25.3.3. Submit forecast data as soon as possible after requirements are known
         (corresponding Organization Information Data is also necessary). Note: It must be
         stressed that forecasting affects only authorizations. It does not affect actual
         movement of assets, but causes reallocation of existing assets within the equipment
         item requirements computation affecting the AFMC budget/buy requirement position.
         The actual redistribution of SE assets, caused by movement of a system or subsystem,
         is subject to negotiations between the MAJCOMs, the SPM, and the IM.
         5.4.25.3.4. The owning MAJCOM CEMO is responsible for developing,
         maintaining, and reporting forecast authorization equipment data, as required, to
         project equipment requirements in support of programmed and unprogrammed unit
         actions.    Note: Failure to submit accurate forecasts in a timely manner will
         negatively impact the ability of the AFMC Air Logistics Complexes to support the
         projected change.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 251


        5.4.25.3.5. The owning MAJCOM will develop forecasts for base funded items and
        furnish them to the bases to ensure their budget projections are accurately projected.
        Reporting forecasts for base funded assets to AFMC is not required.
        5.4.25.3.6. The owning MAJCOM will notify the host MAJCOM when a unit is to be
        activated, deactivated, moved, or when a mission change will occur within host
        MAJCOM area of control. Additionally, the owning MAJCOM will provide the host
        MAJCOM with all applicable unit forecast authorization equipment data, for centrally
        procured (CP) and base funded items.
        5.4.25.3.7. The applicable CEMO will actively participate with the SPO and SPM in
        the mock-up inspections, development of engineering inspections, contractor
        technical compliance inspections, weapon system phasing group meetings, SE
        reviews, provisioning conferences and other related meetings pertinent to the
        weapon/support system program.
        5.4.25.3.8. When forecasts are developed for programmed changes, the owning
        MAJCOM CEMO must ensure that ILS-S authorization records are not established
        prior to the actions identified in the following paragraphs. When both records
        (Current Authorizations/Forecast Authorizations) are established, the Air Force
        budget requirement is overstated. Additional information regarding forecasting
        authorizations for organization equipment, development of forecast authorization
        records, and forecasting for Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMEL)
        support equipment (SE)is contained in the following paragraphs.
     5.4.25.4. Authorizations for Organization Equipment.
        5.4.25.4.1. Equipment subject to EAID/Forecast authorization includes              all
        nonexpendable items of equipment required for the support of AF organizations.
        5.4.25.4.2. Forecast authorizations will be used to systematically plan, develop and
        report projected equipment requirements for centrally procured items to support
        future conditions.
        5.4.25.4.3. Forecasts will be submitted for each organization requiring organizational
        equipment support programmed in the USAF Program Document “Units, Bases and
        Priorities” (PD) for activation, conversion or reorganization more than 270 days after
        the next scheduled requirements reporting date.
        5.4.25.4.4. Forecasts will be submitted when changes occur in equipment
        authorizations (increase or decrease) due to conditions not reflected in the PD and
        scheduled more than 270 days after the next scheduled requirements PD reporting
        date.
        5.4.25.4.5. Exceptions to the normal 270 days are those SE requirements for PMEL
        (360 days).
     5.4.25.5. Development of Forecast Authorization Records.
        5.4.25.5.1. The development and reporting of forecast authorizations is essential to
        ensure adequate budget/buy and timely supply support for future equipping
        requirements. Forecast records only reflect authorizations for requirements to support
        programmed or unprogrammed unit actions and must be maintained in a current
252                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         status to accurately reflect future authorizations required to support programmed
         actions.
         5.4.25.5.2. The owning MAJCOM is responsible for preparation, maintenance, and
         processing of forecast authorizations of the affected organization, with assistance (as
         necessary) from the appropriate AFMC allowance manager and SPM. When
         forecasts involve tenant units supported by a different command, full coordination
         between the two MAJCOMs and the affected AO is essential.
         5.4.25.5.3. If new weapon or support systems are acquired or if unit strength is
         increased or decreased, a forecast or forecast change must be processed.
         5.4.25.5.4. Forecasts are required when USAF PDs show:
            5.4.25.5.4.1. A weapon or support system is scheduled for activation.
            5.4.25.5.4.2. A unit is scheduled for re-designation.
            5.4.25.5.4.3. A unit is scheduled to convert to a different weapon system or
            maintenance concept.
            5.4.25.5.4.4. Changes are scheduled to occur in operational plans, which result in
            a change in equipment requirements.
            5.4.25.5.4.5. A unit is scheduled for significant changes in personnel capabilities
            and functions.
            5.4.25.5.4.6. A unit is scheduled to transfer between commands more than 270
            days subsequent to the reporting date. The gaining command is responsible for
            submission of the forecast.
         5.4.25.5.5. Forecasts will be submitted when non-programmed (non-USAF PD)
         changes affect (add, increase, delete or reduce) in-being organizational EAID
         authorizations more than 270 days beyond the AFEMS reporting date.
         5.4.25.5.6. Forecasts are required to change requirements to meet:
            5.4.25.5.6.1. Scheduled increased or decreased workloads.        For example:
            Additional tenant units to be assigned to the base and will be supported by the
            host base shops.
            5.4.25.5.6.2. Changes in the numbers or types of systems to be assigned to the
            base and will be supported by base shops.
            5.4.25.5.6.3. Any other future condition scheduled to occur more than 270 days
            after the AFEMS reporting date, which will increase or decrease equipment
            requirements of an in-being base organization.
      5.4.25.6. Forecasting for PMEL Support Equipment.
         5.4.25.6.1. The activation, conversion, movement, or transfer of a weapon system or
         subsystem at a base may require augmentation of, or additional SE within PMEL.
         Care must be taken to ensure these requirements are correctly identified and
         forecasted as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 3.
            5.4.25.6.1.1. If these requirements affect a unit supported under a host/tenant
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  253


            agreement as in AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, the MAJCOM of
            the tenant unit will identify these requirements to the host MAJCOM, to ensure
            they are aware of the mission change.
        5.4.25.6.2. SE requirements for PMEL should be submitted 360 days prior to the
        scheduled event. Input or retention of forecast records within these designated time
        frames would inflate the AFMC buy/budget position. Failure to provide the item
        manager with forecast data pending establishment of in-use details will normally
        result in nonsupport of the requirements.
  5.4.26. Organization Information Record.
     5.4.26.1. Purpose: Describe procedures for management of the organization information
     records. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
     5.4.26.2. Organization Information Records identify all essential data and programmed
     actions associated with an organization. These actions are associated with additions to or
     deletions from assigned systems, activations of new weapon or support systems,
     transfers, moves, redesignations, or the capabilities of the organizations being reported.
     For example, when activating a new organization, you must create a new Organization
     Identity (Org ID) Number.
     5.4.26.3. See AFH 23-123, Vol 3, Ch 4 for applicable ILS-S processes to manage
     Organization Information Records.
  5.4.27. Base Receipt/Issue/Distribution/and Redistribution.
     5.4.27.1. Purpose: Describe procedures for base receipt, issue, distribution and
     redistribution of equipment. The ILS-S is designed to respond to processed receipt and
     return actions based on previously established due-in, due-out, and equipment in-use
     detail records. The ILS-S will automatically accomplish required issue transactions and
     distribution of assets to authorizations loaded to the EAID record. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2
     (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
        5.4.27.1.1. Upon receipt of equipment, the AO will update established due-in/due-out
        and EAID records when an issue is made to a designated organization. If the need
        exists to fill a higher priority request, the AO may reassign the item.
        5.4.27.1.2. When an organization reports excess equipment on hand, care will be
        taken to ensure that overages are actually in excess to authorizations, rather than
        belonging to another custody account. The AO will check due-in records to ascertain
        if a different organization has a shortage and, when possible (if the item is not USAF
        or CEMO controlled), reissue to that shortage.
        5.4.27.1.3. If turned in assets cannot be reallocated to an existing base organization
        the AO will report the item to the applicable IM and await IM disposition
        instructions. Procedures for reporting excess equipment are contained in Sec. 5D,
        Equipment Management.
     5.4.27.2. Current AO EAID records are reported online in the AFEMS/C001, and used
     for computation of requirements and establishing buy/budget positions. IMs screen
 254                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


       output products for obvious errors and reconcile quantities prior to taking procurement,
       disposal, or redistribution actions.
          5.4.27.2.1. Assets reported in excess of established authorizations and/or reflecting
          ASC “000” generate queries from the IM to record validity and availability of excess
          for redistribution.
          5.4.27.2.2. The queries are forwarded to the reporting AO, who will verify the
          reported excess. Replies to IM queries are required as soon as possible, but not later
          than ten working days after receipt.
       5.4.27.3. Decentralized Procurement Distribution/Redistribution. The distribution and
       redistribution of assets procured under the decentralized process will be at the direction
       of the MAJCOM that owns, or has funded for, the asset(s). MAJCOMs must coordinate
       these actions with the IMs to ensure the most urgent requirements are filled, when
       possible, and that critical assets are not prematurely disposed.
   5.4.28. Equipment Disposition for Base Deactivation and Closure.
       5.4.28.1. Purpose: Describe procedures for Equipment disposition for Base Deactivation
       and Closure. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
       guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS).
       5.4.28.2. LRS or Materiel Management Activities will contact AFMC SCM-R
       Allowance Activity and MAJCOM Equipment Management to coordinate the disposition
       of equipment in conjunction with base deactivation and closures.
          5.4.28.2.1. Upon coordination in Para 5.4.28.2, LRS/Materiel Management
          Activities will assign Allowance Source Code 076 for bases undergoing deactivation.
          This code identifies excess related personal property reflected on the AO managed
          EAID holding account pending transfer to civil engineering and subsequent reporting
          to General Services Administration (GSA) on SF 118C, Related Personal Property
          Schedule C - Supplement to Report of Excess Real Property.
          5.4.28.2.2. Assets will be transferred directly from the active in-use custodian
          account to the AO holding account to preclude stock fund capitalization action.
          5.4.28.2.3. LRS/Materiel Management Activities will consult the AFMC SCM-R
          Allowance Activity and MAJCOM Equipment Management for guidance regarding
          any further required actions.

Section 5E—Document Control and Detail Records

5.5. Document Control and Detail Records.
   5.5.1. Quality Control of Documents.
       5.5.1.1. Purpose: To explain the quality control procedures for documents. For policy
       specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
       5.5.1.2. General Procedures for Quality Control. LRS/Materiel Management Activities
       will follow the procedures outlined below concerning the quality control of documents.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    255


         5.5.1.2.1. Required Documents. Begin by comparing the information on the
         document control record (DCR) with the information on one of the following: the
         ILS-S document, or Document Control copy of the source document. When
         procedures state that a specific copy of a document is to be used as the Document
         Control copy, the most legible copy may be substituted when the document specified
         is marred or hard to read. Also, verify all accountable equipment documents are
         signed for by the applicable equipment custodian. Additionally, ensure only
         individuals officially appointed as inspectors verify condition of property. Note:
         Automated document control uses the DCR from the microcomputer database to
         make these comparisons (see Para 5.5.3.4.2 of this document).
         5.5.1.2.2. Filing DCR. DCRs are created by the applicable ILS-S during end-of-day
         processing.
         5.5.1.2.3. Filing source documents. Generally, source documents are filed according
         to organization and ascending document number to match the document control
         record sequence.
         5.5.1.2.4. Weapons Inventory Listing. Document Control will maintain a signed copy
         of the Weapons Inventory Listing IAW AFRDS. A letter attached to the listing must
         summarize the results of the inventory, any differences, and the action taken to
         correct the differences. The Materiel Management Officer must sign the letter and the
         LRS CC/AO must approve it.
         5.5.1.2.5. Matching. To match document control records with their documents, use
         the last 8 positions of the document number. Exception: For stock-funded, locally
         manufactured items the document control records will contain the organization and
         shop code of the manufacturing activity in positions 30-35. Note: The Document
         Control copy for these receipts will contain the base stock record account number in
         the document number field of the materiel management document.
         5.5.1.2.6. Errors. If you find an error or an omission that you can correct, do so.
         Otherwise, return the document to the responsible activity for immediate corrections.
         5.5.1.2.7. Disposition. After you have validated the document and performed the
         required quality control checks, either destroy it or place it in a valid document file.
         Note: Bases in wartime categories 1, 2, and 3 must validate only the signature on a
         document.
  5.5.2. Shipment Suspense Processing.
     5.5.2.1. Purpose: To explain the quality control procedures for Shipment Suspense
     Processing. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.5.2.2. General Procedures for Shipment Suspense Processing.           LRS/Materiel
     Management Activities will follow the procedures outlined below concerning the
     management of Shipment Suspense Processing. This section describes the procedures
     that Document Control uses to manage the shipments both with and without the CMOS
     interface. Shipments without the CMOS interface are controlled by using the shipment
256                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      suspense file and either a shipment suspense detail or shipped not credited detail.
      Shipments using the CMOS interface are controlled entirely by either a SSC or a SNC.
      5.5.2.3. Shipment Suspense (SSC) Output. The ILS-S will provide an output of an SSC
      image under several conditions when not operating with the CMOS interface. These
      conditions are described below.
      5.5.2.4. Bases operating with a CMOS interface.
         5.5.2.4.1. Redistribution Order and Referral Order Inputs. With these inputs, the ILS-
         S will output an SSC and also create a shipment suspense detail when shipment action
         is initiated. For each different stock number, system designator, document number,
         and/or suffix code that is shipped, there will be one SSC output and one shipment
         suspense detail established.
         5.5.2.4.2. Replies to Reports of Customer Excess. With these inputs, the ILS-S will
         output an SSC and create a SNC detail when credit return shipment action is initiated.
         5.5.2.4.3. DLADS Transfer Inputs. These inputs will produce an SSC and build a
         shipment suspense detail. The SSC output will contain a T in position 7.
         5.5.2.4.4. CMOS Interface Processing. When the CMOS interface is in operation,
         Document Control does not retain shipment documents and transfers to off-base
         DLADS and off-base organizations.
             5.5.2.4.4.1. A SSC detail or a SNC detail is created and an electronic image is
             sent to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. SSC images are not created
             because CMOS generates SSC inputs and automatically updates the shipment
             suspense/shipped not credited details with the in checker identification code, date
             inchecked, TCN, date shipped, and mode of shipment code.
             5.5.2.4.4.2. There are exceptions when Document Control must manually update
             details. The Customer Support NCOIC assigns a three-digit numerical in checker
             code to each person in Document Control, and any other authorized outside
             activities when approved by the LRS CC/AO, to be used when processing manual
             updates. These codes must be controlled. Use the following procedures when
             processing these exceptions:
                5.5.2.4.4.2.1. Downgraded Low Dollar Value Property. When low dollar
                value property is authorized to be downgraded to scrap and not sent to
                DLADS, the inspector sends a copy of the document to Document Control.
                Document Control personnel processes an SSC to update the applicable detail
                with the in checker code and date. A TCN is assigned in accordance with SSC
                input format and Entry requirement in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
             5.5.2.4.4.2.2. Non-CMOS Property Transfers. When property is moved from one
             account to another and not moved through the LRS/Materiel Management
             Activity, a transaction exception code will be used to bypass CMOS. A DCR will
             be established and a signed document will be returned, cleared, and filed under
             normal document control procedures.
         5.5.2.4.4.3. Procedures for Degraded Operations Recovery. During these operations,
         the LRS/Materiel Management Activity enters data for each transaction manually. All
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 257


        SSCs for these transactions are stored in the ILS-S interface until recovery is
        complete. When the interface is activated, the SSC transactions are processed.
        5.5.2.4.5. Transfer of Property to DLADS. When property is moved to the DLADS
        and delivered by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity and not through the LRS, a
        signed copy of the transfer document must be provided to Document Control.
        Shipment suspense details are created to use for DLADS confirmation and follow-up
        (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 8 for more information on intransit control system
        transaction flow). A DCR is created and a signed document is returned to Document
        Control and cleared under normal document control procedures.
        5.5.2.4.6. Deployed MRSP Details. When MRSPs are deployed, each detail is
        flagged to create off-base releases of property. Normally, these must pass through the
        LRS/Materiel Management Activity. However, when MRSPs are about to be
        returned and the MRSP personnel do not want to ship items to the deployed location,
        they should sign for the property and send a signed copy to Document Control.
        Document Control clears the document. These documents are then filed as normal.
        5.5.2.4.7. Non-CMOS/Agile Logistics/Two-Level Maintenance (2LM) Shipments.
        When reparables are shipped to repair activities directly from the DSE bypassing the
        LRS/Materiel Management Activity, Document Control will update the SSC from the
        document control shipment copy. The Document Control copy of the materiel
        management document will be signed and forwarded to Document Control. These
        documents will be cleared and filed under normal Document Control procedures. It is
        mandatory that the SSC be updated within four hours from the time the property is
        picked up by the express carrier.
  5.5.3. Automated Document Control.
     5.5.3.1. Purpose: To explain the Procedures for Automated Document Control. For
     policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
     23-123.
     5.5.3.2. General Procedures for Automated Document Control. The following actions
     pertain to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity utilizing an Automated Document
     Control. Procedures concerning document removal, document signatures, specific
     quality control checks, control checks for supporting documentation, document
     verification procedures for DLADS in-transit control program, degraded operations
     document processing, delinquent document requirements, and permanent document file
     requirements are explained in other sections concerning Document Control in this
     manual.
     5.5.3.3. Any document can be printed from the Automated Document Control system
     (AIS) by Document Control.
     5.5.3.4. Exceptions to Procedures.   The following is a list of changes arising from
     automating document control.
        5.5.3.4.1. Modified delinquent date. Normally, documents must be processed and
        cleared within five calendar days or they become delinquent. Documents that have a
        delinquency standard other than five calendar days, require that the document control
258                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         record be annotated with the modified delinquent date. Document Control uses the
         Change Work File to enter the Julian date showing the modified delinquent date in
         the OPR field of the DCR.
         5.5.3.4.2. Document Control Record (DCR). It is Document Control's responsibility
         to maintain the DCR data file. Document Control performs the quality control checks
         then updates the DCR database using the personal computer process. More
         information on DCRs can be found in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
         5.5.3.4.3. DSD. Document Control creates and loads the DSD record on the database
         (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for procedures) and deletes the DSD when it is
         cleared.
      5.5.3.5. DDL. Document Control provides a two-part Delinquent Document Listing--part
      one for Document Control and part two for all other functions. Each part is further broken
      into pre-delinquent and delinquent listings. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for more
      information.
      5.5.3.6. CTH Inquiries. Document Control processes TIP/BATCH CTH inquiries from a
      terminal through screen inputs (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for CTH inquiry
      procedures).
      5.5.3.7. Automated reversal. Document Control processes reversal inputs on CTH
      records. The automated program creates the reversal inputs and displays them for review
      before processing. The automated reversal procedures are in Para 5.6.2
      5.5.3.8. Personal Computers. Procedures for the automated processing of document
      control records are in Para 5.5.3
  5.5.4. Filing Documents.
      5.5.4.1. Purpose: To explain the quality control procedures for filing documents. For
      policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
      23-123.
      5.5.4.2. General Procedures for Filing Documents.             LRS/Materiel Management
      activities will follow the procedures outlined below concerning the filing of documents.
      5.5.4.3. Required Checks. Before filing documents, complete all required quality control
      checks. These are outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 of this instruction. Once all
      checks for completeness are accomplished, the document(s) may be filed.
      5.5.4.4. Document Filing.
         5.5.4.4.1. Arrange documents in Julian date serial number sequence.
         5.5.4.4.2. Remove the corresponding document control suspense record from the file.
         5.5.4.4.3. Do a quality control check. If the document control suspense record and
         the source document do not match, correct the errors using the instructions in Sec. 5F,
         Record Reversal and Correction. If the DCR and the source document match, use
         the code in position 53 to tell you which of the following actions to take:
             5.5.4.4.3.1. All materiel management activities will retain all source documents
             with TRICS ISU, TIN, REC, DOR, MSI, SHP, AXA, BSU, FCH, and FCU for 75
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 259


            months (6 years and 3 months) regardless of what is in position 53. The materiel
            management accounts with an applicable materiel management automated
            tracking system do not need to maintain paper copies if the transaction was
            processed through this automated system. However, these transactions must be
            retained in this automated system for 75 months. All other transactions not
            processed through this automated tracking system will be maintained using the
            current Document Control Imaging System (DCIS). The materiel management
            accounts that have a DCIS or like system may continue to use the system instead
            of filing paper copies.
     5.5.4.5. All other TRICs.
        5.5.4.5.1. If an F appears in position 53, file the source document in the appropriate
        document file and destroy the document control record.
        5.5.4.5.2. If a D appears in position 53, destroy both the source document and the
        document control record.
        5.5.4.5.3. If an audit, inspection, or other reason requires Document Control to keep
        documents you usually destroy after a specific time, maintain the documents in a
        separate file. Do not mix them with documents normally filed by Document Control.
        Batch file them without regard to any filing sequence.
     5.5.4.6. Weapons Inventory Listing. Document Control will maintain a signed copy of
     the Weapons Inventory Listing IAW AFRDS. A letter attached to the listing must
     summarize the results of the inventory, any differences, and the action taken to correct
     the differences. The Materiel Management Officer must sign the letter and the LRS
     CC/AO must approve it.
  5.5.5. Processing Degraded Operations Documents.
     5.5.5.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures for processing degraded operations
     documents. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.5.5.2. General Procedures for Processing Degraded Operations Documents.
     LRS/Materiel Management activities will follow the procedures outlined below
     concerning the processing of degraded operations documents.
     5.5.5.3. General Issues, Releases, and Shipments. Once the appropriate signature has
     been obtained, Document Control will receive copy 1 of all degraded operations
     documents .
        5.5.5.3.1. Maintain these documents in a suspense file according to ascending Julian
        date serial number.
        5.5.5.3.2. When the transaction appears on the Document Register, perform quality
        control IAW Para 5.5.1 and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5.
        5.5.5.3.3. If the document is one that Document Control must keep, file the
        handwritten accountable materiel management document in the permanent document
        file.
260                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.5.5.4. Returns. Receiving or designated return point will send a copy of all returns to
      Document Control.
         5.5.5.4.1. Maintain returns in a suspense file in document number order.
         5.5.5.4.2. When the return appears on the Document Register, perform quality
         control checks outlined in Para 5.5.1 and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5.          Note:
         Single returns with partial credit return require special processing. There will be two
         document control records (DCR) representing a separate transaction for these returns.
         You must consider the total action quantity shown when you perform the quality
         control check. If reversal action is required, you must process separate inputs for each
         transaction.
  5.5.6. The Delinquent Document Listing.
      5.5.6.1. Purpose: To explain the quality control procedures for managing the Delinquent
      Document Listing. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
      specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.5.6.2. General Procedures for the Delinquent Document Listing.  LRS/Materiel
      Management Activities will follow the procedures outlined below concerning the
      management of the Delinquent Document Listing.
         5.5.6.2.1. Obtain current Delinquent Document Listing.
         5.5.6.2.2. Review Listing. Verify that the documents were not previously given to
         Document Control personnel. Contact applicable section delinquent document
         monitors to verify location/status of particular document(s). Hold delinquent
         document meetings as needed with LRS/Materiel Management Activities.
         5.5.6.2.3. Distribute the Listing. Distribute copies of the delinquent listing to the
         applicable LRS flights and other Materiel Management activities as well as other
         agencies local management has chosen. Document Control keeps one copy of the
         listing.
         5.5.6.2.4. Annotate listing. Annotate Document Control's copy of the delinquent
         listing to mark the documents still being processed and the flight responsible.
         5.5.6.2.5. Destruction of the delinquent listing. You may destroy the Document
         Control copy of the delinquent listing after you have annotated the next day's run of
         the listing.
         5.5.6.2.6. Further Actions for Delinquent Documents. Begin aggressive action to
         locate documents the first day they appear on the delinquent document listing and
         continue the research on the second day. If a document is still missing after it appears
         on three daily listings, you must obtain a duplicate or prepare a replacement. Your
         action will depend on the type of document you are looking for and at what stage in
         processing it is lost or missing. Remember, you must consider completing the
         transaction as well as properly documenting it.
             5.5.6.2.6.1. Lost Documents. If the intended receiver has no record of and does
             not have the property, prepare a replacement document, initiate a mandatory
             special inventory, and complete issue or shipping action. If the special inventory
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    261


            shows that a shortage exists, Inventory will start proper action. The inventory
            results will support the complete inventory adjustment. If no shortage exists, file
            the completed replacement document. No record reversal action is necessary.
            5.5.6.2.6.2. Lost document certification. If you cannot find a signed copy 1, 2, 3,
            or 4 from the original set or a reproduction of the signed copy 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the
            original set, then a replacement document will be created with a certificate of lost
            document stamped or typed on the Document Control copy. This certificate will
            state that a thorough search has been made. Include any other details important
            enough to mention. Forward to Document Control for filing. Note: A duplicate
            means copy 2, 3, or 4 of the original document. A replacement is a hand scribed
            or typed copy to look like the original.
            5.5.6.2.6.3. Procedures for lost DLADS shipping documents: First, see if a
            duplicate copy of the lost shipping document exists. Contact the
            custodian/activity, local LRS/transportation activity, or the local DLADS that was
            to receive the property to see if copy 2, 3, or 4 of the shipping document is
            available. If a duplicate copy is available, it may be used without certification. If
            it is not, then prepare a replacement. The replacement will be signed by the
            intended custodian or activity, the local LRS/transportation activity, or the local
            DLADS. Send a copy of the certified document to the intended receiver.
        5.5.6.2.7. Follow-up. Complete follow-up actions on delinquent documents each day
        until the document(s) is/are received.
        5.5.6.2.8. Notify Leadership as necessary.
  5.5.7. Delinquent Shipment Listing.
     5.5.7.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures for management of the Delinquent
     Shipment Listing. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
     specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.5.7.2. General Procedures for Management of the Delinquent Shipment Listing.
     LRS/Materiel Management Activities will follow the procedures outlined below
     concerning the management of the Delinquent Shipment Listing. This listing provides
     Document Control with a list of all shipment transactions for which the SSC detail or
     SNC detail has not been updated with transportation data (TCN, in checker code, in
     checker date, mode of shipment, and date shipped) using the SSC input. Detailed
     instructions for the Delinquent Shipment Program are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
     Pt 2, Ch 6. Additionally, more information concerning Shipment Suspense detail records
     can be found in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 8.
     5.5.7.3. Processing Frequency. Document Control requests that the delinquent shipment
     listing be processed every 2 weeks. If the base is using the automated applicable
     SBSS/CMOS interface, the listing should be processed each week. More information on
     the interface of the materiel management and transportation systems can be found in Sec.
     7C, Supply Chain Materiel Management System and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7.
     5.5.7.4. Output. The delinquent shipment listing is produced in six parts:
262                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.5.7.4.1. Parts I and II contain delinquent SSC and SNC records which have not
         been updated with transportation data. Parts I and II are not produced when the base
         is using the automated SBSS/CMOS interface.
         5.5.7.4.2. Part III contains both SSC and SNC detail records for which the
         LRS/transportation activity has provided only an estimated date the item was shipped
         and a transportation hold code was not provided. These details are identified by an
         asterisk (*) in position 1 of the TCN field. Part III is not produced when the base is
         using the automated SBSS/CMOS interface.
         5.5.7.4.3. Part IV contains a separate list of delinquent shipment suspense detail
         records for all transfers to DLADS which were shipped through the base
         LRS/transportation activity channels but have not been updated with an SSC input.
         The delinquent shipment listing determines whether LRS/transportation activity or
         the LRS/Materiel Management Activity delivery was used for disposal documents by
         checking the “TMO-DRMO-DELIVERY-FLG” on the 516 record. If the flag is set to
         a T, the LRS/Materiel Management Activity delivers the shipment directly to
         DLADS. This part is not produced if DLADS shipments are delivered directly by the
         LRS/Materiel Management Activity or if the base is using the automated
         SBSS/CMOS interface.
         5.5.7.4.4. Part V is produced only when the automated SBSS/CMOS interface is
         being used. The listing contains all SSC and SNC records for which the
         LRS/transportation activity has not provided an in checker code and in checker date.
         5.5.7.4.5. Part VI is produced for those SSC and SNC records where the in checker
         code and date are present but the TCN and/or Mode of Shipment are/is blank.
         5.5.7.4.6. Processing Parts I, II, and IV for Bases not using the SBSS/CMOS
         Interface.
      5.5.7.5. Document Control Actions. To process parts I, II, and IV details, check 1)
      previous delinquent shipment listings provided by the LRS/transportation activity for
      transportation data, 2) any unprocessed transportation data provided by the
      LRS/transportation activity and 3) delinquent document files. Line off any entry on the
      listing found during the above checks so the LRS/transportation activity does not review
      these details. Enter any unprocessed transportation data found on an SSC input and
      process to the ILS-S. Forward the updated delinquent shipment listing (original and one
      copy with carbon, do not separate) to the LRS/transportation activity within 1calendar
      day after receiving the listing.
      5.5.7.6. LRS/transportation activity processing actions. To process the delinquent
      shipment listing, the LRS/transportation activity will follow the steps below:
         5.5.7.6.1. Review the delinquent shipment listing against appropriate materiel
         management documents.
         5.5.7.6.2. Return copies of these documents with the listing if they have not
         previously been provided to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   263


        5.5.7.6.3. If copies have been sent to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity, the
        LRS/transportation activity will enter the transportation data on the listing and return
        the annotated listing to Document Control for processing of an SSC input.
        5.5.7.6.4. If the LRS/transportation activity cannot provide either hold data or
        TCN/GBL, but is sure the shipment was made on a specific Julian date, it will
        provide these data.
     5.5.7.7. Document Control Actions.
        5.5.7.7.1. When Document Control receives either copies of transportation
        documents or the annotated delinquent shipment listing, enter the TCN/GBL data in
        the SSCs and input them to the ILS-S to update the SSC detail.
        5.5.7.7.2. When the LRS/transportation activity is sure a shipment was made on a
        specific Julian date but cannot provide hold data or TCN/GBL, Document Control
        will check to see that a completed shipment document signed by the
        LRS/transportation activity is on file. If a document is on file, then enter the
        following data on the SSC input: an asterisk (*) in position 62, and the Julian date of
        the shipment in positions 63-66. Next process the SSC image to update the SSC
        detail.
        5.5.7.7.3. Part III Processing for Bases without CMOS Interface. Part III of the
        delinquent shipment listing contains SSC/SNC details for which the
        LRS/transportation activity has provided an estimated date shipped and a
        transportation hold code was not provided. The estimated date shipped, as provided
        by the LRS/ transportation activity, will appear in the date shipped field of the
        SSC/SNC detail. This part of the listing provides information about the number of
        shipments the LRS/transportation activity makes for which the ILS-S has been
        provided no TCN/GBL or hold code. If the LRS/transportation activity has the
        TCN/GBL for a shipment that appears in this part of the listing, it will send a copy of
        the materiel management document along with the listing. Document Control will
        then use the TCN/GBL to process the appropriate SSC input and update the
        SSC/SNC detail.
        5.5.7.7.4. Part V Processing for Bases with CMOS Interface. Part V of the delinquent
        shipment listing will include those SSC/SNC details which have no in checker
        number or in checker date in the detail. This is an indication that the
        LRS/transportation activity has not received the property for shipment.
        5.5.7.7.5. Document Control must check with the section shipping the materiel to
        ensure the property has been moved, and no delays in shipping have occurred. If
        delays have occurred, line through the items that have not been forwarded to the
        LRS/transportation activity for shipment. Forward the listing to the
        LRS/transportation activity. The LRS/transportation activity will use the listing to
        either provide transportation data or annotate the listing with no record of the
        shipment found. The listing will then be returned to Document Control.
        5.5.7.7.6. For any item that the LRS/transportation activity has no record of the
        shipment, Document Control will freeze the item record and request an inventory.
264                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             5.5.7.7.6.1. If inventory results indicate an overage equal to (or greater than) the
             quantity on the shipment document exists then prepare a certified replacement
             document and complete the shipping action. No inventory adjustment for the
             shipment quantity or record reversal and correction action is necessary.
             5.5.7.7.6.2. If inventory results do not indicate an overage equal to (or greater
             than) the quantity on the shipment document exists then further research may be
             necessary.
         5.5.7.7.7. Part VI Processing for Bases with CMOS Interface. Part VI of the
         delinquent shipment listing will include those SSC/SNC details which have the in
         checker code and date in the detail but lack the TCN and Mode of Shipment. This is
         an indication that the LRS/transportation activity has received the property but not
         released it for shipment.
         5.5.7.7.8. Part VI should be annotated and forwarded directly to the
         LRS/transportation activity for research. The LRS/transportation activity must
         provide the missing data and/or conduct research to verify receipt by the consignee of
         the shipment. The listing will then be returned to Document Control.            Note:
         Manually processed SSCs must also include the date shipped. This date is used to
         Shipment Suspense Record deletion during follow-up.
  5.5.8. Monitoring Authorizations to Receipt for Property.
      5.5.8.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures for monitoring authorizations to receipt for
      property. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
      guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.5.8.2. General Procedures for Monitoring Authorizations to Receipt for Property.
      LRS/Materiel Management activities will follow the procedures outlined below
      concerning the monitoring authorizations to receipt for property.
      5.5.8.3. Initiating Activity Responsibilities. The organization commander to include the
      LRS CC/AO must do the following:
         5.5.8.3.1. Submit a letter to the Customer Support which identifies individuals
         authorized to receive classified and NWRM property. The letter will contain the data
         elements specified in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, Receipt Authorization Record
         for Classified/NWRM Property.
         5.5.8.3.2. For munitions, the initiating activity will follow the specific requirements
         in AFI 21-201 and AFI 21-204, Nuclear Accountability Procedures.
         5.5.8.3.3. For classified equipment, the initiating activity will submit all requests to
         appoint or change a custodian directly to the EAE. EAE maintains the custodian
         authorization receipt file according to Sec. 5D, Equipment Management. EAE will
         provide a copy of this request (letter) to Document Control, or Customer Support, and
         Vehicle Management so they can update the Authorization Receipt Listing and notify
         internal LRS/Materiel Management Activity agencies of the change/update.
         5.5.8.3.4. Every June and December the initiating activity reviews the Authorization
         Receipt Listing provided by the LRS CC/AO, annotates required changes, signs and
         dates the listing, and returns it to the LRS CC/AO.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     265


          5.5.8.3.5. Retain the Classified and NWRM Authorization Receipt Listing from
          Document Control or Customer Support until it receives an updated listing.
      5.5.8.4. Responsibility of the LRS CC/AO. The LRS CC/AO will provide a letter of
      receipt authorization to activities that can process classified and NWRM property. This
      letter will identify the LRS/Materiel Management Activity representatives authorized to
      receive classified and NWRM property.
      5.5.8.5. Responsibilities of Document Control or Customer Support. For classified
      receipt authorizations for and NWRM property, Document Control or Customer Support
      will:
          5.5.8.5.1. Prepare Classified and NWRM Authorization Receipt Listing from the
          receipt authorizations. Document Control will send a complete copy to each internal
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity. One copy will be used to provide supported
          activities with a list of individuals authorized to receive classified and NWRM
          property for their organization.
          5.5.8.5.2. Record all changes to the current Classified and NWRM Authorization
          Receipt Listing. Beginning with 1, number each change to the listing. Notify internal
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity activities and the supported agencies either by
          letter or listing. Note: Changes to the current activity requesting the change, receipt
          listing do not require you to process a complete new listing.
          5.5.8.5.3. Perform a semiannual revalidation of authorizations to receipt for classified
          and NWRM property each June and December. The validations are done by sending
          organizations a copy of their portion of the authorization listing which is prepared
          from the file maintained according to this paragraph. Necessary additions, changes,
          and deletions are annotated by the organizations and the listings are returned to
          Document Control or Customer Support. Document Control or Customer Support
          then updates the file and produces a new, updated listing for distribution according to
          this paragraph.

Section 5F—Record Reversal and Correction

5.6. Record Reversal and Correction.
   5.6.1. Record Reversal and Correction Research.
      5.6.1.1. Purpose: To explain the record reversal and correction research procedures
      process. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
      guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.6.1.2. General Discussion: Inadequate research and subject knowledge could result in
      rejects or erroneous inventory adjustments (i.e. Transaction Identification Codes
      (TRIC’s), Type Transaction Phrase Codes (TTPC), and reversal sequence). Reversible
      TRIC’s and TTPC’s are located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. The key is the word
      “reverse.” The reversible transactions that appear on the CTH will be processed in
      reversal order according to TRIC’s and TTPC’s. Instructions on considerations for detail
      records i.e., Special Purpose Recoverable Asset Maintenance (SPRAM), War Reserve
      Materiel (WRM), Mission Support Kit (MSK), Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), In-
266                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      Place Readiness Spares Packages (IRSP) and Due In From Maintenance (DIFM) are
      located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Guidance on Material Support Division prices
      on the transaction history is located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Moving Average
      Costs required for Reversal Records are located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
      5.6.1.3. The following actions will be performed in order:
         5.6.1.3.1. From your research: determine the TRICS, TTPC, and record reversal
         processing order utilizing appropriate IT systems
             5.6.1.3.1.1. Process a stock number inquiry to obtain interchangeable items and
             substitutes in appropriate IT system
             5.6.1.3.1.2. Process a consolidated transaction history record (CTH) on all related
             stock numbers in appropriate IT system
             5.6.1.3.1.3. After determining that a record reversal correction is needed: assign
             freeze code “Q” to all affected item records utilizing the appropriate IT systems.
             Information addressing Freeze Code “Q” and its effects on record reversal and
             correction in the appropriate IT system is located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch
             5, Item Record Preparation for Record Reversal. Note: AFMC SCM-R Activities
             will coordinate with the LRS/Materiel Management Activity prior to processing
             record reversal and correction transactions on shipments and RDOs to ensure
             property has not departed from the base.
             5.6.1.3.1.4. Print a copy of the freeze code load notice and attach it to the reversal
             record source document.
             5.6.1.3.1.5. Fill out reversal record source document for processing in appropriate
             TRIC/TTPC transaction sequence.
             5.6.1.3.1.6. Forward the reversal record source document to LRS CC/AO
             designated personnel to process reversal inputs.5.6.1.4. Determine the proper
             sequence for record reversal. All personnel responsible for record reversals must
             determine the proper sequence of each transaction, i.e. due-out releases (DOR’s)
             before receipts (REC’s), etc.
      5.6.1.4. Those processing the record reversal will coordinate with Asset Management to
      determine correct quantities, unit of issue or stock numbers when necessary to ensure
      accurate processing of the record reversal.
  5.6.2. Automated Record Reversal.
      5.6.2.1. Purpose: To explain the reversal inputs for Automated Record Reversal from
      the Consolidated Transaction History records that has been researched by the initiator.
      For policy specific requirements review, AFI-23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
      AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
      5.6.2.2. General Discussion: Only one TRIC can be processed at a time when utilizing
      this program. Be sure to process the individual TRIC’s in the reversal order you identify.
      All information and requirements for normal record reversal processing also applies to
      the automated record reversal. Inputs on the applicable IT systems require the TTPC,
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     267


     date, and serial number of the transaction you want to reverse. This includes TTPC’s
     from all stock numbers that are applicable to the transaction being reversed.
         5.6.2.2.1. Review all prefilled areas on record reversal screen for accuracy before
         input.
         5.6.2.2.2. Ensure the cursor is placed at the end of the last field on the screen before
         transmitting.
  5.6.3. Steps of Document Distribution.
     5.6.3.1. Purpose: To identify possible steps to ensure the capture of record reversal and
     correction documentation. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for
     IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.6.3.2. This procedure will help with the quality assurance of the process of getting the
     reversal out of the system.
         5.6.3.2.1. The initiator will forward the record reversal and correction request to
         his/her assigned supervisor.
         5.6.3.2.2. Upon supervisor approval, the initiator will provide the request to the
         Materiel Management Flight Commander /Chief for approval.
         5.6.3.2.3. After Materiel Management Flight leadership approval, the initiator will
         provide the request to the Record Reversal monitor for processing the reversal.
         5.6.3.2.4. The initiator records the dates and transaction serial numbers on the record
         reversal and correction log. Sample log is located in Document Identifier Code
         (DIC)/Transaction Identifier Code (TRIC) Authorized Record Reversal, AFH 23-123,
         Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. If the type of transaction was a receipt and multiple inputs were
         required, enter the date and 3333transaction serial numbers which were applicable to
         type transaction phrase codes (2T, 1Y, or 1W), since no output documents are created
         for these TTPCs.
         5.6.3.2.5. Record Reversal and Correction Action monitor will forward the original
         output to Document Control for filing.
            5.6.3.2.5.1. AFMC SCM-R Activities will process their own record reversal and
            correction actions. The AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity will retain
            record reversal and correction documentation for AFMC SCM-R Activities and
            will forward a copy to the base for document control purposes.
         5.6.3.2.6. Additional copy of output provided to initiator for corrective action after
         reversal of transaction to ensure all reversal actions were completed.
         5.6.3.2.7. After verification of completion of all reversal actions, additional copies of
         output documentation should be destroyed.
         5.6.3.2.8. Notify stock control of all transactions affecting unserviceable details in
         order to report or to delete excess detail records.
  5.6.4. Forced Record Alteration.
268                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.6.4.1. Purpose: Occasionally, there will be conditions created on a database that
      cannot be corrected by processing normal transactions. When these conditions exist the
      records must be altered or deleted. However, there are conditions where record
      alterations should never be used; this includes QLP with update, and DBE (Database
      Editor). It is mandatory that all errors should be corrected by processing a normal input
      or a series of inputs, such as file maintenance, reverse-post, or inventory adjustments in
      lieu of a Forced Record Alteration. AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 3 contains more
      information on forced record alteration process, for other policy specific requirements
      review AFI 23-101.
      5.6.4.2. Caution: Forced Record Alteration processing input images are not written to
      audit trail tape.
      5.6.4.3. Forced Record Alteration processing. This program will permit alteration or
      deletion of records on the database. The execution of this program is restricted and
      should only be executed by personnel who are familiar with database management
      system commands and the structure of the database. All Forced Record Alteration
      requests will be reviewed and approved by the Materiel Management Flight
      Commander/Chief and the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity. AFMC SCM-R
      and Contingency account Record Alteration Requests will be reviewed/approved by the
      AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity only."
         5.6.4.3.1. After documentation has been reviewed and approved the LRS/Materiel
         Management Activity requesting activity will submit a Forced Record Alteration
         request using the AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity website
         https://private.amc.af.mil/635SCMG/CST/SCMGeFORCED                       RECORD
         ALTERATION/ for processing. If the reason for the request was for system related
         errors include the Difficulty Report (DIREP) or Computer Systems Discrepancy
         (CSD) ticket number as part of the Forced Record Alteration documentation.
         5.6.4.3.2. After processing, AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity or
         Computer Operations will provide both the before and after image and annotate the
         output document with an explanation of why an alteration was made, as well as the
         date completed. The document must also indicate if A&F and satellites or other type
         stock record account records were affected. The Forced Record Alteration output will
         be signed by the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity. For base level
         generated Forced Record Alterations AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity
         personnel will provide the electronic copy to the requesting/owning account for filing
         through                                  their                               website
         https://private.amc.af.mil/635SCMG/CST/SCMGeFORCED                        RECORD
         ALTERATION/.
         5.6.4.3.3. The original copy of the document, all supporting documentation, and a
         signed Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document (IAD) Register will be filed in
         the Document Control. Each document produced by a record being changed or
         deleted is assigned a serial number under program control. The serial number consists
         of a 4-digit Julian date and a 4-position serial number. The serial number portion of
         the control number is stored in the inventory adjustment record and is updated each
         time a document is produced. The latest serial number will be printed on the monthly
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  269


        Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register allowing Document Control
        to account for record alterations.
        5.6.4.3.4. Once a month, verify the accuracy of the Forced Record Alterations file.
        Compare the number of documents in the file with the last serial number used for the
        month, printed on the monthly Consolidated IAD Register. If the Register Serial
        Number and the file do not agree, the following procedure is used to account for and
        correct the difference:
            5.6.4.3.4.1. Conduct an extensive search to determine the reason for the
            disagreement. Note: The serial number for a Forced Record Alteration output
            document is stored on the Miscellaneous Transaction Summary Record. Do not
            confuse this serial number with the normal transaction serial number. Systems
            documents will start with serial number 0001 for primary gangs and 5001 for
            secondary gangs.
            5.6.4.3.4.2. The section supervisor must submit a letter fully explaining the
            reason for the difference, complete with support documents (copies of RPS/main
            site console outputs, etc.). Note: It is important that Document Control have as
            much information as possible to explain the discrepancy.
            5.6.4.3.4.3. The Force Record Alteration serial number will be reset when the
            end-of-year option of the Prep Inventory Accuracy Records Report is processed.
            The date in the document number will indicate the date the AF IT System
            processed the input.
            5.6.4.3.4.4. If a complete record is lost and must be reconstructed on the
            database, use the applicable inputs to reestablish the record. For example, if an
            item record is lost, use a FIL input to reload the record; use an inventory
            adjustment input to establish the serviceable balance (if applicable) and execute
            the Force Record Alteration to enter applicable data in other fields that cannot be
            entered with normal inputs.
  5.6.5. Query Language Processor (QLP) with Update.
     5.6.5.1. Purpose: It is mandatory that all ERRORS should be corrected by processing a
     normal input or a series of inputs, such as file maintenance, reverse-post, or inventory
     adjustments, in lieu of QLP with Update. Occasionally however, there will be conditions
     created on a database that cannot be corrected by processing normal transactions and
     Query Language Processor (QLP) with Update will be required. For other policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.6.5.2. General Discussion: AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity will provide
     the DISA OKC with a request letter of individuals authorized to process QLP with
     Update.
     5.6.5.3. QLP with Update. All QLP w/update transactions will be coordinated/approved
     by the authorized AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity. The AFMC SCM-R
     Computer Operations Activity will maintain a control log of all QLPs with update. The
     log will contain the date; serial number; reasons for use, including database/areas
     affected; who authorized use; names of personnel using the program; and what was
 270                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


       changed. AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity personnel will provide the
       electronic copy to the requesting/owning account for filing through their website
       https://private.amc.af.mil/635SCMG/CST/SCMGeFORCED RECORD ALTERATION/.
       The Materiel Management Activity will process the hard copy output resulting from use
       of QLP with update in the same manner as a Forced Record Alteration document,
       annotated with the information from the control log, and filed in Document Control.
       5.6.5.4. AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity will take all output from this
       process and follow the rules of documenting and filing output required for Forced Record
       Alterations. A write once/read only electronic media may be used in lieu of printed
       output. The documentation must state why Forced Record Alterations or other inputs
       could not be used to modify the records and approval official's name and rank. Document
       Control will file the output with the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document
       Register, M10/NGV836.
       5.6.5.5. Wing and MAJCOM inspectors, along with AF Audit personnel, can request
       from DISA OKC personnel a list of user-IDs, dates, and times that QLP with Update was
       invoked (by researching audit trail tapes and spooled master console data), to provide a
       check of compliance with this instruction.

Section 5G—Physical Inventory and Inventory Adjustments

5.7. Physical Inventory and Inventory Adjustments.
   5.7.1. Establish and Distribute an Inventory Schedule.
       5.7.1.1. Purpose: To provide an inventory schedule by fiscal year to ensure all items
       assigned a warehouse location and/or on a detail record are inventoried at prescribed
       frequencies. For policy specific requirements and frequency review AFI 23-101, Sec. 5G,
       Physical Inventory and Inventory Adjustments. For other policy specific requirements
       review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
       5.7.1.2. The inventory schedule will follow the warehouse location validation for type
       stock record account codes B and E, and satellites.
       5.7.1.3. The following actions will be performed to establish and distribute an Inventory
       Schedule:
          5.7.1.3.1. To be efficient, plan inventories carefully. Determine the length of time
          and the number of items selected for inventory carefully so that normal LRS/Materiel
          Management Activity operations do not suffer.
          5.7.1.3.2. Physical Inventory Control Section will establish an inventory schedule by
          fiscal year.
          5.7.1.3.3. Prepare and publish an inventory count schedule using letter format.
          5.7.1.3.4. Establish an inventory deadline as the date on which the inventory begins.
          The balance on the computer record as of the deadline date is the balance with which
          the inventory count input balance is compared.
          5.7.1.3.5. Provide copies of the inventory schedule to all affected sections/elements
          or flights.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     271


            5.7.1.3.5.1. The LRS CC/AO will notify supported unit commanders of
            upcoming scheduled inventories.
            5.7.1.3.5.2. EAE functions will notify the appropriate unit equipment/SPRAM
            custodians of the inventory schedule to allow proper time to generate necessary
            documents and/or listings, resolve discrepancies, etc. in preparation for the
            inventory.
  5.7.2. Preparing the warehouse for Inventory Count.
     5.7.2.1. Purpose: Provide guidance on preparing the warehouse for an inventory count.
     For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
     AFH 23-123.
     5.7.2.2. All actions applicable to the location scheduled for inventory must be processed
     at least 1 day before the inventory deadline date.
     5.7.2.3. Warehouse personnel accomplish the following to prepare for an inventory
     count:
         5.7.2.3.1. Validate the warehouse location within 10 workdays of the date the
         inventory is to begin. See Sec. 5C, Physical Asset Management of this manual for
         more information on procedures to conduct warehouse validations.
         5.7.2.3.2. Isolate and identify the area scheduled for inventory by clearly marking the
         parameters of the area with ropes, signs, etc. Signs marking off the area must state the
         inventory deadline date so warehouse personnel can monitor transactions occurring
         before that date.
         5.7.2.3.3. Limit movement of assets in the areas to be inventoried to emergency
         issues and to transactions occurring before the inventory deadline date.
            5.7.2.3.3.1. If property is removed from an area under inventory on or after the
            inventory deadline date, record the transactions on a recap sheet. As a minimum,
            entries on the recap sheet must include stock number, system designator, quantity,
            document number, appropriate transaction identification code, and warehouse
            location.
            5.7.2.3.3.2. Items received during inventory are held in the Receiving hold area if
            sufficient space is available. If not, the materiel, a copy of the receipt, and a copy
            of the applicable IT system notice indicating the stock number is frozen for
            inventory will be held in the warehouse storage hold area.
  5.7.3. Complete Inventory Count Procedures.
     5.7.3.1. Purpose: To provide instructions for performing complete inventory counts. For
     policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
     23-123 or the ES-S User’s Manual
     5.7.3.2. CAUTION: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on
     a classified item constitutes a potential compromise of classified information and will be
     reported immediately upon discovery in accordance with AFI 31-401. For NWRM, see
     AFI 20-110 for additional reporting requirements.
272                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.7.3.3. General Procedures for Conducting Complete Inventory Counts: Steps to
      prepare the warehouse for inventory must be completed before the inventory count
      deadline date.
         5.7.3.3.1. Perform complete inventory counts using the closed warehouse-method of
         inventory. See AFI 23-101, Ch 5 for additional information on closed warehouse
         method.
         5.7.3.3.2. Prepare inventory parameter request.
            5.7.3.3.2.1. ES-S Inventory function is the preferred method for inventory
            procedures.             See             ES-S               User’s             Manual
            (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=
            OO-LG-IL-ES-13&Filter=OO-LG-IL-
            ES&tsi=1354113048265&AlertReferer=) for instructions. AFMC SCM-R
            Computer Operations Activity supported accounts will utilize on-line AF Form
            1991. Submit request one day before the inventory count deadline date (See AFH
            23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for inventory parameter request format). Note: ILS-S
            system queries will not be used as the official tool to perform this function.
            5.7.3.3.2.2. To ensure frequency requirements are met, inventory parameters will
            be processed once a month with the Date of Last Inventory (DOLI) option. For
            example, two separate Inventory Count File parameters will be processed for in-
            warehouse assets that will become overdue in the schedule month: one to identify
            item records that will not meet the 365-day/annual requirement (e.g., consumables
            and recoverables) and another for the 180-day/ semi-annual requirements (e.g.,
            classified and COMSEC). Also, DOLI options will be processed to identify detail
            records that will become overdue in the scheduled month (i.e., Supply Point
            Listing, WCDO/WRM Munitions List, Airborne MRSP Listing, etc.)
         5.7.3.3.3. Retrieve the Inventory Count Listing from the reports section of the AFMC
         SCM-R Computer Operations web site via the AF Portal at
         https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
         af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=sF575FC8E256A5E6A01256F8D9872
         016E or LGLOS as applicable.
         5.7.3.3.4. Physically count and record the warehoused/in-use quantity for each item
         listed on the Inventory Count Listing.
         5.7.3.3.5. When the inventory count is completed, inventory personnel must update
         the Physical Count Quantity on each Inventory Count Record and process in the ILS-
         S (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for Inventory Count format).
            5.7.3.3.5.1. If the count quantity and the item record/detail quantity are equal the
            IT system will update the Date of Last Inventory and remove inventory freeze
            codes. No further action is required.
            5.7.3.3.5.2. If the count quantity and the item record/detail quantity are unequal
            the following actions are accomplished:
                5.7.3.3.5.2.1. The IT system updates the applicable inventory accuracy
                record, creates a transaction history, and produces an inventory recount image.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              273


              (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the inventory recount format).
              5.7.3.3.5.2.2. Physically recount the inventory materiel in the location
              indicated on the inventory recount image and record the count balance.
              5.7.3.3.5.2.3. Update inventory recount images with the recount quantity and
              input into the appropriate material management IT system (AFH 23-123, Vol
              2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the inventory recount format).
                5.7.3.3.5.2.3.1. AF policy allows programmatic/automatic inventory
                adjustments for items meeting defined criteria (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
                1, Ch 5 for detailed automatic adjustment criteria).
                5.7.3.3.5.2.3.2. When unequal physical inventory recounts do not qualify
                for programmatic/automatic adjustment, additional research must be
                conducted (See in Para 5.7.5 of this section for complete research
                procedures and documentation requirements).
       5.7.3.3.6. Inventory count completion
          5.7.3.3.6.1. Review Daily Document Registers and Transaction Histories to
          ensure all item movement recorded on recap sheets is processed immediately after
          count/recount processing. Recap sheets may be destroyed after verifying all
          transactions are recorded in the appropriate material management IT system.
          5.7.3.3.6.2. Advise applicable elements/sections/flights the inventory count has
          been completed after all count/recount records and subsequent transactions have
          been processed.
       5.7.3.3.7. Complete Inventory Counts of Supply Points
          5.7.3.3.7.1. The general procedures for complete inventory recounts apply to
          supply point inventory recounts except as detailed below.
              5.7.3.3.7.1.1. Process Supply Point Listing (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5)
              to create the count record database file and print a list of count images for
              supply point items in document number sequence. Inventory count personnel
              advise FSC personnel of applicable supply points undergoing inventory count
              to ensure emergency issues/shipments are recorded on recap sheets. Note:
              ILS-S queries will not be used as the official tool to perform this function
              5.7.3.3.7.1.2. Inventory count personnel perform the physical count of local
              supply point assets with the exception of CCI/COMSEC. LRS CC/AO
              personnel will not physically handle CCI/COMSEC assets, the physical
              inventory count will be conducted only by the CCI/COMSEC monitor. All
              other supply point custodians will assist Inventory Count Personnel as
              required.
              5.7.3.3.7.1.3. Off-base inventory counts are conducted in the same way as
              local supply point inventory counts, except that Inventory Count Personnel
              send only the inventory count listing to the supervisor of the supply point.
              Inventory Count Personnel retains the remainder of the Supply Point Listing
              and appropriate Issues and Inquiries until the inventory count has been
274                                                    AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            completed. The supply point supervisor is responsible for conducting the
            inventory count and for returning the listing to Inventory Count Personnel.
            For satellite accounts, the inputs are returned to satellite Inventory Count
            Personnel. Note: If the annual inventory count is to be conducted at the
            same time as the reconciliation, the Supply Point Listing will be distributed
            by the supply point monitor within the FSC.
            5.7.3.3.7.1.4. Inventory Count Personnel processes inventory recount inputs
            for supply points. Satellite account supply point inventory recounts are input
            by satellite account Inventory Count Personnel.
            5.7.3.3.7.1.5. Inventory Count Personnel can reconstruct lost count or recount
            inputs by obtaining the required data from the count listing.
      5.7.3.3.8. Complete Inventory Counts of MSK/MRSP Assets
         5.7.3.3.8.1. The general procedures for complete inventory recounts apply to
         MSK/MRSP inventory recounts except as detailed below. Note: For recoverable
         and consumable MSK/MRSP items, the item records are not frozen during annual
         inventories
         5.7.3.3.8.2. Conduct an inventory count within 10 working days of return from
         deployment. The 10-day requirement applies if accountability was assumed by
         the forward location. If accountability was retained by the home station, the
         inventory count may be waived if the MRSP was originally stored in locked
         containers with seals affixed and the seals are intact upon return. Otherwise, the
         10-day inventory requirement applies.
         5.7.3.3.8.3. For receipt of an MRSP transferred or loaned from another unit;
         conduct an inventory count at the option of the LRS CC/AO.
      5.7.3.3.9. Complete Inventory Counts of WCDO/IRSP Assets.
         5.7.3.3.9.1. The general procedures for complete inventory recounts apply to
         WCDO/IRSP asset inventory recounts except as detailed below.
         5.7.3.3.9.2. WCDO/IRSP items collocated with normal retail warehouse stock. If
         WCDO/IRSP spares are stored in the same bin location as normal retail stock and
         DO NOT have an RSP warehouse location assigned, conduct the inventory by
         doing the following:
            5.7.3.3.9.2.1. Process Inventory Count Listing (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2,
            Ch 6).
         5.7.3.3.9.3. Segregated WCDO/IRSP spares. If WCDO/IRSP spares are stored
         separately from normal retail stock, and a RSP warehouse location is assigned,
         conduct the inventory by doing the following:
            5.7.3.3.9.3.1. Process WCDO list using the inventory select option (AFH 23-
            123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6).
            5.7.3.3.9.3.2. Process IRSP using the inventory select option (see AFH 23-
            123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6).
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                275


          5.7.3.3.9.4. MAJCOMs authorized IRSP will ensure local inventory procedures
          are developed and coordinated with the storing activity when these assets are not
          stored in the LRS CC/AO storage facility. Inventory Count Personnel provides
          the storing activity with an annual inventory count schedule. The inventory count
          is jointly accomplished by personnel from Inventory Count Personnel and the
          storing activity.
       5.7.3.3.10. Complete Inventory Counts of CCI/COMSEC on MRSP or Equipment
       Details.
          5.7.3.3.10.1. The general procedures for complete inventory apply to
          CCI/COMSEC MRSP/CA-CRL inventory recounts except as detailed below.
          5.7.3.3.10.2. Inventory Count Personnel schedule CCI/COMSEC inventories on a
          semi-annual basis in February and August. However, RSP personnel/equipment
          custodian will perform the required physical inventory count. Inventory Count
          Personnel WILL NOT physically handle CCI/COMSEC assets.
          5.7.3.3.10.3. In addition to scheduling inventories, Inventory Count Personnel
          will take the following actions:
             5.7.3.3.10.3.1. Advise the applicable custodian of the inventory count date so
             all transactions can be recorded on a recap sheet.
             5.7.3.3.10.3.2. Obtain the required inventory count list (MRSP listing/CA-
             CRL) using the inventory count option (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6).
             Send the MRSP custodian the inventory count list. Note: ILS-S queries will
             not be used as the official tool to perform this function.
          5.7.3.3.10.4. RSP personnel/equipment custodians will perform a100% physical
          inventory count by serial number. Specifically, physically verify the serial number
          on the item to the serial number on inventory list; enter the quantity on hand on
          the inventory count list, and return to Inventory Count Personnel for immediate
          processing.
          5.7.3.3.10.5. Overage/Shortage of CCI/COMSEC. If the physical inventory
          count does not agree with the supply system inventory balances, an inventory
          recount image is produced.
             5.7.3.3.10.5.1. Inventory Count Personnel must notify the LRS CC/AO, the
             CCI/COMSEC custodian, and the organization commander of a possible
             overage/shortage of CCI/COMSEC.
             5.7.3.3.10.5.2. Inventory Count Personnel will assist the RSP
             personnel/equipment custodian in performing the required research (see
             Para.5.7.5. for additional information on research). Note: For equipment
             items, coordinate with EAE for additional research and corrective actions.
             5.7.3.3.10.5.3. If the cause of the overage/shortage cannot be determined, the
             LRS CC/AO and/or organization commander will notify the appropriate
             security manager to initiate an inquiry into the probable compromise. Process
             the probable compromise according to DoDM 5100.76, V3, AFI 31-401, and
             AFMAN 23-220. Note: The CCI/COMSEC custodian / equipment custodian
276                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                 is responsible for any additional reporting actions (see AFI 33-201, V1,
                 Communications Security (COMSEC), and V5, Controlled Cryptographic
                 Items (CCI), for additional information on CCI/COMSEC materiel).
         5.7.3.3.11. Conduct complete inventory counts of BEAR Unit Type Codes (UTC
         upon return from a deployment.
         5.7.3.3.12. When the annual inventory count schedule is completed, Inventory Count
         personnel will prepare an inventory parameter request using the DOLI option (See
         AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 to detect and produce inventory count outputs for item
         records that contain a warehouse location or serviceable balance but have not been
         inventoried in the past 365 days or in the last 180 days for sensitive and classified
         items.
  5.7.4. Special Inventory Count Procedures.
      5.7.4.1. Purpose: To provide instructions for performing special inventory counts to
      reconcile out-of-balance conditions discovered during other than complete inventory
      counts. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance
      use AFH 23-123 or the ES-S User’s Manual.
      5.7.4.2. Caution: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a
      classified constitutes a potential compromise of classified information and will be
      reported immediately upon discovery in accordance with AFI 31-401. For NWRM items,
      see AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions.
      5.7.4.3. Conducting Special Inventory Counts: The following paragraphs explain
      generalized procedures for requesting and conducting special inventory counts. If an
      inventory functional section/element does not exist at satellite accounts, the host base
      performs the special inventory. Note: Special inventory counts do not satisfy the
      requirement for complete inventories.
         5.7.4.3.1. Special Inventory Interrogations are required for:
             5.7.4.3.1.1. Insufficient Balance. When an insufficient balance exists for a
             degraded ops transaction, item condition code changes, or identity changes, the
             appropriate Material Management IT System will programmatically freeze the
             item record. Inventory Count Personnel will receive the degraded ops transaction
             reject and the special inventory request.
             5.7.4.3.1.2. Warehouse       Refusal.    For     warehouse    refusals,    the
             warehouse/stockroom supervisor will process the special inventory request and
             forward the output notice to Inventory Count Personnel.
             5.7.4.3.1.3. Other. Inventory Count Personnel will process the request for other
             special inventory requirements.
         5.7.4.3.2. Process a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
         1, Ch 5 to freeze the item record and/or details with freeze code I and produce a
         Special Inventory Count Output Notice (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5)
         containing pertinent asset, detail, and history information. Transactions that do not
         affect the serviceable balance of a frozen item record will be allowed to process.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    277


        5.7.4.3.3. Inventory Count Personnel will manage a Special Inventory Suspense file.
            5.7.4.3.3.1. Retain the suspense file copy of the Special Inventory Interrogation
            Inputs and/or reject notices. Automated files will be used in lieu of paper.
            5.7.4.3.3.2. After the inventory count is complete, pull the suspense copy for
            distribution. Return a copy of the annotated Special Inventory Interrogation Input
            to the requesting activity. If an automated file is used, notify the requester and
            delete the record.
            5.7.4.3.3.3. Destroy the suspense copy for policy-directed special inventories (ex:
            control item change or critical item code change).
        5.7.4.3.4. Count the items in the bin location reflected on the Special Inventory
        Count Output Notice (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5).
        5.7.4.3.5. If the item count is equal to the quantity indicated in the output notice,
        process a Special Inventory Input transaction using the format provided in AFH 23-
        123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Note: If a Transaction Exception Code is in the input, it
        appears on the M10 Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register for the
        management review.
        5.7.4.3.6. If the item count is not equal to the quantity indicated in the output notice,
        conduct research to determine the cause and appropriate actions to correct the out-of-
        balance condition. See Para 5.7.5 of this section for details about how to conduct the
        research.
        5.7.4.3.7. When the research is complete and corrective actions have been taken,
        process an inventory recount input using the format provided in AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
        Pt 1, Ch 5.
     5.7.4.4. Special Inventory Procedures for Selected Conditions.           The following
     paragraphs detail additional special inventory count procedures as they apply to specific
     conditions.
        5.7.4.4.1. Warehouse Refusals or Insufficient Balance Rejects.
            5.7.4.4.1.1. If Inventory Count Personnel receive warehouse refusals without a
            Special Inventory Output Notice (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) attached,
            they should prepare and process a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH
            23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) for the item(s).
                5.7.4.4.1.1.1. Distribution of Warehouse Refusal Documents.            The
                distribution of warehouse refusal documents depends upon the outcome of the
                special inventory count.
                5.7.4.4.1.1.2. Assets Not Found. If Inventory Count Personnel cannot find
                the assets associated with the warehouse refusal, distribute the related
                documents as follows:
                5.7.4.4.1.1.3. Issue Documents (to include Bench Stock Issues). Distribute
                issue documents as follows: copy 1 to Document Control; copy 2 to Input
                source; copy 3 to Organization; copy 4 to the FSC.
278                                                      AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             5.7.4.4.1.1.4. Shipping Documents.     Distribute shipping documents as
             follows: copy 1 to Document Control; copy 2 to Input source; all other copies
             will be destroyed
             5.7.4.4.1.1.5. Reverse-Post Document. Forward the copy of the reverse-post
             document (DD Form 1348-1A) to Bench Stock Support, so that the master
             bench stock format will be re-input.
             5.7.4.4.1.1.6. Assets Found. If Inventory Count Personnel find asset(s)
             associated with the warehouse refusal, return the documentation to Storage
             personnel for action.
         5.7.4.4.1.2. For insufficient rejects without a Special Inventor Output Notice,
         prepare and process a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol
         2, Pt 1, Ch 5).
      5.7.4.4.2. Controlled Item Code Changes. When a controlled item code is upgraded
      and the item record has a serviceable balance or a warehouse location, the item record
      will be frozen for a special inventory count. Special Inventory count images will be
      systematically created when controlled item code changes occur and detail records
      have an on-hand balance exist.
         5.7.4.4.2.1. Inventory count images for DIFM details are created when the DIFM
         status flag equals zero and for unserviceable details when the first six positions of
         the document number equals R920RW.
         5.7.4.4.2.2. Unserviceable Asset Special Inventory Counts.          Use the
         Unserviceable Detail List section of the Repair Cycle Asset Management List to
         perform the inventory of unserviceable detail assets.
         5.7.4.4.2.3. Notify Personnel. When counting out-of-warehouse assets (DIFM,
         supply point, etc.), Inventory Count personnel notify the personnel who are
         counting the materiel of the new controlled item code, so that adequate security
         measures are taken.
      5.7.4.4.3. Unserviceable Asset Overage. Take the following actions if the special
      inventory count result indicates an unserviceable asset overage exists:
         5.7.4.4.3.1. Unserviceable DIFM item:
             5.7.4.4.3.1.1. Overage Found--Unserviceable Detail Already Loaded. If there
             is an overage and an unserviceable detail is loaded for the stock number, use
             Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) to increase the
             detail balance.
             5.7.4.4.3.1.2. Overage Found--Unserviceable Detail Not Loaded. Pick up
             supply items by processing an Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol
             2, Pt 1, Ch 5) with TEX code L (found on base) followed by a condition code
             change (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5).
         5.7.4.4.3.2. Unserviceable Equipment Items. Inventory works with EAE to
         determine if the previous user caused the overage by forwarding a return item to
         the unserviceable warehouse location without processing the TIN input. Note:
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                279


          when dealing with overage of a serialized control item, contact the applicable
          Item Manger with the actual serial number of the asset. The Item Manager will be
          able to tell you who the last owner of the asset was, by organization and shop
          code, and SRAN. Never process an FOB TIN on a serialized control
          (CCI/COMSEC/weapon) asset.
              5.7.4.4.3.2.1. Previous User Known. If you can determine the previous using
              organization, process a P or E activity code return (whichever is appropriate)
              using their organization code. This records the unserviceable detail and
              updates the authorized/in-use detail record if appropriate.
              5.7.4.4.3.2.2. Previous User Unknown. If you cannot trace the asset to a
              previous user, process a serviceable Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123,
              Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) with TEX code L followed by a Condition Code Change
              (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). This action establishes an unserviceable
              detail record.
       5.7.4.4.4. Unserviceable Shortages. If there is a shortage, process a Special
       Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) to decrease and/or delete the
       unserviceable detail record. Notify FSC Personnel of all transactions affecting
       unserviceable detail records to ensure reporting, control, and shipment of
       unserviceable assets.
       5.7.4.4.5. Identity Changes. If recorded assets or item records require identity
       changes, Inventory Count Personnel will work with Inspection and Storage personnel
       to provide the data necessary for proper validation and corrective action according to
       Sec. 5I, Inspection and Related Operations.
       5.7.4.4.6. Problematic warehouse location changes.
          5.7.4.4.6.1. Inventory Count Personnel screen the file maintenance
          transactions(activity code Y) on Daily Document Resisters to ensure newly
          assigned warehouse locations are valid. When new locations are not valid,
          Inventory Count Personnel must initiate special inventory count procedures to
          verify the locations and quantities on hand.
          5.7.4.4.6.2. When the items are not located, inventory adjustments will be
          processed in accordance with this section.
          5.7.4.4.6.3. When locations are determined to be valid, update the inventory
          schedule to ensure locations are included in normal inventory cycle.
       5.7.4.4.7. Misidentified Serialized Control CCI/COMSEC Items. Special inventory
       procedures must be used to re-identify serialized control CCI/COMSEC items.
          5.7.4.4.7.1. Process a return to decrease the Authorized-In-Use-Detail record for
          the losing stock number.
              5.7.4.4.7.1.1. Process a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH 23-
              123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) to freeze the stock number on the losing in use detail
              record.
              5.7.4.4.7.1.2. Process a COMSEC/CCI Serialized Control Input-Format Two.
280                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                 Use type phrase IADDTL.
                 5.7.4.4.7.1.3. Process a Special Inventory Input to decrease the in use
                 quantity on the losing in use detail record.
             5.7.4.4.7.2. Increase the Authorized In Use Detail record for the gaining stock
             number.
                 5.7.4.4.7.2.1. Process a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH 23-
                 123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) to freeze the stock number on the gaining in use detail
                 record.
                 5.7.4.4.7.2.2. Process COMSEC/CCI Serialized Control Input-Format Two.
                 Use the type phrase IADDTL.
                 5.7.4.4.7.2.3. Process a Special Inventory Input to increase the in use quantity
                 on the gaining in use detail record.
  5.7.5. Researching Out-Of-Balance Inventory Conditions.
      5.7.5.1. Purpose:     Provide procedures for researching inventory out-of-balance
      conditions. For additional information on research requirements, accounting adjustments,
      and determining cause, see AFI 23-101, Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and Inventory
      Adjustments, DoDR 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Vol 12, Ch 7,
      and AFPD 65-1, Management of Financial Services. For other policy specific
      requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.7.5.2. Caution: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a
      classified or NWRM constitutes a potential compromise of classified information and
      will be reported immediately upon discovery in accordance with AFI 31-401. For
      NWRM, see AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions.
      5.7.5.3. General research requirements associated with specific inventory deficiencies.
      Research begins with the current date and continues back either one year, to the last
      inventory adjustment, or the previous DOLI. Research is not mandatory for automatic
      adjustments (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for Automatic Adjustment Criteria).
         5.7.5.3.1. Research all variances, including DIFM balances, before input of the
         recount to determine cause and/or correct the following accountable processing
         errors:
             5.7.5.3.1.1. Review the Consolidated Transaction History Inquiry Report to find
             erroneous transactions.
             5.7.5.3.1.2. Account for transactions that may not have been posted. Review
             unprocessed backlog including warehouse recap sheets, the daily/cumulative
             reject listing, and the receiving line for assets that have not been forwarded to
             Central Storage.
             5.7.5.3.1.3. Review Serviceable Balance with no Location function (see ES-S
             User’s Manual) to determine if a different warehouse location was assigned.
             Correct warehouse location errors.
             5.7.5.3.1.4. Review IT audit trail file to determine if a notice to stock is on file
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   281


            with a warehouse location.
            5.7.5.3.1.5. Review emergency issues made during complete inventory count to
            ensure all physical movement of materiel in and out of the storage bin was
            properly recorded.
            5.7.5.3.1.6. Do any additional research required to review locally established
            processes.
        5.7.5.3.2. After research, correct the discrepancies via the following actions as
        appropriate:
            5.7.5.3.2.1. Complete a Record Reversal to correct erroneous transactions
            detected during research for resolved discrepancies.
            5.7.5.3.2.2. Advise Central Storage or the warehousing activity for other type
            accounts and satellites to move the property to the correct location or to process a
            warehouse location change.
            5.7.5.3.2.3. Process backlog transactions that include corrected/rejected
            documents by other applicable sections or flights for resolved discrepancies.
            5.7.5.3.2.4. Adjust the count or recount quantity for unresolved discrepancies.
            Then reprocess the count or recount image.
     5.7.5.4. Document research actions (including discrepancies and corrective action) and
     file this document in Document Control as a supporting document. MAJCOM
     determines the format and data required.
     5.7.5.5. When initial research does not identify the probable cause(s) of inventory loss,
     further research may be required. See AFI 23-101, Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and
     Inventory Adjustments and AFMAN 23-220 for additional guidance.
        5.7.5.5.1. Further research is conducted by a person not supervised by the
        accountable or responsible officer.
        5.7.5.5.2. The results of the investigation or ROS will be documented on DD Form

     5.7.5.6. Investigating Discrepant DLADS Shipments/Transfers. Intransit control
     procedures are an additional control for discrepant DLADS shipments or transfers. They
     do not affect inventory adjustment procedures and criteria. Use the inventory procedures
     below to investigate and process Disposal Follow-Up from DLADS .
        5.7.5.6.1. When Document Control forwards a copy of the Disposal Follow-Up from
        DLADS to Inventory, perform a special inventory to determine why a quantity
        variance exists between the quantity shipped/transferred to the DLADS Location and
        the quantity reported to the DLADS. Complete the special inventory and return the
        Disposal Follow-Up from DLADS to Document Control within ten days.
        5.7.5.6.2. Inventory Personnel will determine if the property was removed from the
        warehouse and delivered to the DLADS Location or if the property was transferred to
        Cargo Movement for shipment to the DLADS Location. If the property is located,
        Inventory ensures it is promptly delivered or transferred to the DLADS Location
282                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.7.5.6.3. If the property is not located and you suspect theft or fraud is the reason
         property is not in the warehouse or at DLADS Location, document these findings and
         present them to the Operations Officer. The Operations Officer reviews the findings
         and if warranted, initiates a request for criminal investigation according to AFI 90-
         301, The Inspector General Complaints Resolution. If the DLADS Location never
         received the shipment/transfer, enter an L in position 44 and enter zeros in pos. 25-29.
  5.7.6. DIFM Inventory Procedures.
      5.7.6.1. Purpose: To provide instructions for performing DIFM inventory counts. For
      policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH
      23-123 or the ES-S User’s Manual.
      5.7.6.2. Caution: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a
      classified or NWRM constitutes a potential compromise of classified information and
      will be reported immediately upon discovery in accordance with AFI 31-401. For
      NWRM, see AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions.
      5.7.6.3. Conducting DIFM Inventory Counts: DIFM Reconciliations satisfy the
      requirement to inventory out-of-warehouse recoverable items. When discrepancies are
      discovered between DIFM record balances and the physical count, FSC will request a
      special inventory by processing a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH 23-123,
      Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5).
         5.7.6.3.1. Special Inventory Counts of DIFM Items. Conduct the following steps for
         resolving variances in DIFM inventory
             5.7.6.3.1.1. Perform a physical count.

             Para. 5.7.5 of this section.
         5.7.6.3.2. If research confirms adjustment or records reversal/correction is not
         required, do the following:
             5.7.6.3.2.1. Process a Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch
             5) with the item record serviceable balance or the detail balance in the inventory
             count to remove the freeze code.
         5.7.6.3.2.2. If records reversal and correction is required to resolve the discrepancy,
         take the following action:
                 5.7.6.3.2.2.1. Prepare and process reverse-post and/or other transactions as
                 required (see Sec. 5E, Document Control and Detail Records of this
                 manual).
                 5.7.6.3.2.2.2. If applicable, forward warehouse refusal documents to Central
                 Storage to release materiel for customer equipment.
                 5.7.6.3.2.2.3. Annotate the Special Inventory Interrogation Input notice with
                 the action taken. Use this notice to clear the freeze code suspense file.
         5.7.6.3.3. When adjustments are required, do the following:

            Enter the stock number, system designator, count quantity (leading zeros are not
            required), and TEX code, if applicable. The document number and research date
            fields will be required if the suspense image is for a DIFM detail inventory count.
            5.7.6.3.3.2. If required, prepare reverse-post transactions.
            5.7.6.3.3.3. Annotate the Special Inventory Interrogation Input notice with the
            corrective action. Keep the notice in suspense until the adjustment appears on the
            document register. Use this notice to clear the freeze code suspense file.
        5.7.6.3.4. The following special instructions apply for unserviceable assets found on
        base:
            5.7.6.3.4.1. If an asset does not seem to belong to an existing detail,
                5.7.6.3.4.1.1. Input Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch
                5) TEX L to pick it up on the item record serviceable balance.
                5.7.6.3.4.1.2. Process a condition change request to establish an unserviceable
                detail, and transfer the assets.
            5.7.6.3.4.2. If the item is unserviceable and belongs to an existing detail, use
            normal processing. For serialized controlled items, create the serial number record
            (in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10) with the phrase IADITM (inventory
            adjustment item).
  5.7.7. Equipment Inventory Counts.
     5.7.7.1. Purpose: Provide procedures for completing inventory counts of in-use/in place
     equipment. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
     guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.7.7.2. CAUTION: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on
     a classified or NWRM constitutes a potential compromise of classified information and
     will be reported immediately upon discovery in accordance with AFI 31-401. For
     NWRM, see AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions. The following actions will
     be performed by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity/unit equipment custodians:

     inventory and documentation requirements can be found in AFI 31-101. For IT specific
     guidance, see AFH 23-123.
     5.7.8.2. General Inventory Requirements. SA/LW require serial number inventories at
     prescribed intervals (excludes depot level activities). Equipment custodians are
     responsible for maintaining, accounting for, inventorying, and managing the use of
     SA/LW on authorized in-use details. CA/CRL Listing will be used to conduct SA/LW
     inventories (see Para.5.7.7. for additional information on equipment inventory
     procedures). Maintain inventory records in accordance with AFRIMS.
        5.7.8.2.1. Unit level SA/LW are assigned to and maintained by an organization solely
        intended for that organization's use (e.g. CES, SVS, SFS, etc.). Unit level SA/LW
        will be inventoried monthly by serial number.
            5.7.8.2.1.1. Owning organization equipment custodian will perform the monthly
            inventory by serial number.
        5.7.8.2.2. Base level SA/LW are assigned to and maintained by LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity and intended for base use. LRS/Materiel Management Activity
        is responsible for storage, accountability and management of SA/LW for base
        requirements. Base level SA/LW will be inventoried semi-annually by serial number.
            5.7.8.2.2.1. LRS/Materiel Management Activity equipment custodians perform
            100% semiannual inventory by serial number using the CA/CRL.
            5.7.8.2.2.2. Conduct semi-annual inventories 1-31 March and 1-30 September.
            5.7.8.2.2.3. Coordinate at least one inventory cycle with the annual Combat Arms
            inspection.
        5.7.8.2.3. For inventory purposes, permanently affix sequentially numbered anti-
        pilferage seals to containers.
        5.7.8.2.4. Inventory the contents of each container by serial number and record on a
        locally developed spreadsheet. Note: This spreadsheet will include the following
        minimum information: account code (ORG/SHOP), detail number, NSN,
        nomenclature, serial number from the SA/LW, butt number (if applicable), number
        assigned to the container and serial numbers from the anti-pilferage seals.
            5.7.8.2.4.1. Include a copy in the outside container packing list.
            5.7.8.2.4.2. Forward copies of the spreadsheet to Document Control and EAE to
            ensure anti-pilferage seal integrity. The Document Control copy is the official
            record.
     5.7.8.3. Conducting SA/LW Inventory. Use the following procedures for conducting
     SA/LW inventories:
        5.7.8.3.1. EAE will provide custodians CA/CRLs on the first duty day of the month.
        Custodians will complete the SA/LW inventory and return the signed CA/CRL within
286                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         15 workdays (30 workdays for off base). The custodian and commander of the
         owning organization will sign the CA/CRL or SPRAM listing.
         5.7.8.3.2. EAE will process a Weapons Serialized Control Input (Format Two) as
         outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 with type phrase “INVDTL” to update
         the serialized control detail record DOLI.
         5.7.8.3.3. EAE will file the signed inventory CA/CRL in the master jacket file.
      5.7.8.4. Use the following procedures for banded and crated SA/LW.
         5.7.8.4.1. Banded and crated SA/LW will consist of a 100 percent count by serial
         number Custodians may use the spreadsheet on the outside of the container for the
         first and second inventory.
         5.7.8.4.2. Custodians will open all SA/LW in sealed containers and perform a
         physical inventory by serial number every third inventory.
         5.7.8.4.3. When there is any evidence of tampering or the anti-pilferage seal serial
         numbers do not match those recorded on the Document Control maintained
         spreadsheet, custodians will open containers and complete a 100% inventory by serial
         number.
      5.7.8.5. Discrepancy Reporting. Complete the following actions within 24 hours of
      discovering the discrepancy. If the error is unresolved after 24 hours, follow installation
      procedures for lost/stolen SA/LW.
         5.7.8.5.1. EAE and inventory count personnel will provide assistance to the
         equipment custodian to determine if the discrepancy is the result of supply transaction
         processing.
             5.7.8.5.1.1. If research reveals a supply transaction error, inventory count
             personnel will correct the error.
         5.7.8.5.2. Missing SA/LW. Conduct an immediate 100% floor-to-book serial
         number inventory of the SA/LW storage facility and a review/validation of hand
         receipts.
             5.7.8.5.2.1. If the floor to book inventory does not resolve the error, EAE will
             process an AFEMS small arms serial number inquiry. Contact the CEMO if
             further assistance is required. If weapon cannot be found follow procedures for
             Lost or Stolen SA/LW
         5.7.8.5.3. Lost or Stolen SA/LW. If a SA/LW is lost or suspected stolen, contact
         SFS immediately. Make other notifications as required in the installation’s
         procedures for lost or stolen SA/LW IAW 31-101.
         5.7.8.5.4. Found SA/LW. Immediately following the identification of a found
         SA/LW, contact EAE for inventory research assistance.
             5.7.8.5.4.1. If EAE cannot establish SA/LW ownership, contact SFS to
             determine if the SA/LW was reported stolen.
             5.7.8.5.4.2. If ownership remains undetermined, contact the CEMO for
             assistance.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                              287


     5.7.8.6. Inventory Adjustments of SA/LW. If a verified overage/shortage exists, see
     Weapons Serialized Control Input (Format Two) as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
     Ch 10 for serialized control processing that must accompany inventory adjustment
     procedures.
  5.7.9. NWRM Inventory Procedures.
     5.7.9.1. Purpose: To describe the general procedures associated with conducting Semi-
     annual NWRM Worldwide Inventory (WWI) and inventories required when the NWRM
     Accountable Officer (NWRMAO) changes. Additional information, including
     appointment/certification of NWRM inventory team, can be found in AFI 20-110. For
     other policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
     AFH 23-123.
     5.7.9.2. A complete physical count of NWRM by serial number and/or Unique Item
     Identification (UII) will be conducted semiannually and/or upon change of NWRMAO to
     obtain agreement between the physical on-hand NWRM balances and the accountable
     record balance. NWRM inventories validate the existence and completeness of 100% of
     the NWRM. Existence indicates items selected from the Accountable Property Systems
     of Record (APSR) (i.e. SBSS, CAS, DSS, etc.) are physically inspected. Completeness
     indicates all assets are accounted for in the APSR.
        5.7.9.2.1. The change of NWRMAOs requires a 100% inventory to support the
        effective date of transfer. For the accounting of all NWRM, the losing NWRMAO
        will direct a 100% inventory of NWRM. This inventory will be validated (reviewed
        with the inventory officer (IO), ref. Para. 5.7.9.3.3.3 and AFI 20-110) by both the
        losing and gaining NWRMAOs to certify a joint 100% inventory as of the effective
        accountability transfer date. See Sec. 1B, Organization Structure and
        Responsibilities for Change of NWRMAO procedures. Note: Semiannual
        inventories can be used to suffice for the requirement for a change of NWRMAO
        provided both gaining and losing individuals approve the inventory and no
        transactions affecting stock record balances occur between the end date of the
        inventory and the effective date of the transfer of accountability.
        5.7.9.2.2. AF activities will conduct the NWRM inventory during the same month of
        the installation’s nuclear weapons Semiannual Inventory Report (SIR) IAW TP 100-
        3150, Joint Reporting Structure; Nuclear Weapons Reports.
        5.7.9.2.3. AF activities that do not conduct a SIR, will conduct the NWRM
        semiannual inventory in the months of March and September.
        5.7.9.2.4. NWRM will be inventoried according to the policies prescribed in AFI 20-
        110 and the procedures in this section.
        5.7.9.2.5. CAS managed NWRM will use CAS procedures found in AFI 21-201,
        Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management. Note: Out-of-cycle inventory
        counts do not satisfy semiannual complete inventory requirements. The LRS CC/AO
        may elect to conduct an annual inventory count for any class or type of asset other
        than controlled assets, to include NWRM.
288                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         5.7.9.2.6. Due to information system constraints and to ensure schedules and
         deliveries are not impacted, it is up to the respective organization to determine if
         items need to be frozen within the repair cycle for proper count during the inventory
         period.
         5.7.9.2.7. NWRM installed on-weapon systems (e.g. missiles, aircraft) will not be
         inventoried.
      5.7.9.3. Roles and Responsibilities for Semiannual Inventory
         5.7.9.3.1. HQ AFMC: Directs and manages the semiannual NWRM world-wide
         inventory on every NWRM with an on-hand balance in materiel management APSR
         to include all detail/custody balances.
             5.7.9.3.1.1. Provides specific dates for the stop movement and freeze of NWRM.
             The inventory freeze will take place during a two week period in the months of
             March and September for executing the inventory (except AF activities with a
             SIR, who follow TP 100-3150). The inventory freeze will be lifted after all units
             have completed their physical count.
             5.7.9.3.1.2. All materiel management ASPR NWRM items will be frozen for
             inventory. The AFMC NWRM Transaction Control Cell (NTCC) manages
             inventory freeze codes and updates the Date of Last Inventory (DOLI) after the
             inventory is complete.
             5.7.9.3.1.3. Identifies a POC to provide NWRM information to the MAJCOMs
             and consolidates all NWRM inventory results forwarded to HQ AFMC thru

       5.7.9.3.3. The NWRMAO will:
          5.7.9.3.3.1. Review the inventory data spreadsheet provided by AFMC to
          validate locations, baseline quantities or volume to determine number of teams
          required to perform inventories in the allotted inventory period.
          5.7.9.3.3.2. Assemble the inventory team(s) coordinating with appropriate
          organizations and assign inventory area of responsibility.
          5.7.9.3.3.3. Appoint an IO in writing and select additional team members to assist
          with inventory as required.
          5.7.9.3.3.4. The inventory team members must be identified no later than (NLT)
          seven days prior to the start of the inventory to allow time to arrange for access
          into the secured areas.
          5.7.9.3.3.5. The Inventory Team will be comprised of the following individuals:
          an IO with materiel management experience and a verifying individual. The
          organizational equipment custodian will be required to support the inventory of
          assets on in-use details. The team may be further supported with additional
          personnel to facilitate the inventory (moving property, unpackaging and
          repackaging assets, etc.). Maintenance/munitions SMEs will assist in determining
          special asset handling requirements. (See AFI 20-110 for additional information
          on inventory teams).
          5.7.9.3.3.6. Coordinate with the respective area being inventoried to provide
          special instructions for access, safety, electro-static discharge (ESD) prevention,
          and other required information.
          5.7.9.3.3.7. Schedule the times and locations for the inventory teams (where to go
          and when).
          5.7.9.3.3.8. Ensure all inventory team members are authorized to enter all
          locations where NWRM are stored.
          5.7.9.3.3.9. Brief the inventory team on the details and procedures of conducting
          a ‘blind inventory.’
          5.7.9.3.3.10. Use the inventory spreadsheet and current APRS data to identify all
          locations where NWRM is stored. Note: The inventory spreadsheet(s) will not be
          used to perform the inventory; it will be used to reconcile the results after the
          inventory is complete.
          5.7.9.3.3.11. Create blind inventory count cards for each NWRM NSN using the
          Excel template provided (for an example, see NWRM Inventory Count Card
          Template, AFH 23-123,Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). Only the NSN and location/facility
          will be filled in.
             5.7.9.3.3.11.1. NWRM Storage Facility (NSF) may use DSS-generated
             products.
          5.7.9.3.3.12. Provide NWRM inventory count cards to the team verifying
          officer(s) Sample count cards are provided in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
290                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            5.7.9.3.3.13. Provide NWRM Smart-Book (if used, see 5.7.9.4.) for assigned
            inventory area.
            5.7.9.3.3.14. In coordination with inventory team(s), reconcile the blind
            inventory count cards with the inventory spreadsheet after inventory counts are
            complete.
            5.7.9.3.3.15. Conduct thorough and in-depth causative research for any and all
            variances or discrepancies.
            5.7.9.3.3.16. Report discrepancies IAW this manual and AFI 20-110.
            5.7.9.3.3.17. Perform additional trend analysis of the inventory and provide
            results to inventory OPR at the AFMC NTCC within 30 calendar days of
            inventory closeout.
         5.7.9.3.4. Inventory Officer will:
            5.7.9.3.4.1. Perform the physical count, annotate the NWRM inventory count
            card(s), and provide the information to the inventory team verifier at the end of
            each count.
            5.7.9.3.4.2. Keep track of the NWRM inventory count cards given to the
            inventory team.
            5.7.9.3.4.3. Validate the count and direct recounts when the physical count does
            not match the accountable balance on the inventory spreadsheet.
            5.7.9.3.4.4. Initiate causative research for all inventory discrepancies.
         5.7.9.3.5. The verifying individual will:
            5.7.9.3.5.1. Accomplish an audit of account in conjunction with the NWRM
            inventory. See AFI 20-110 for audit of account procedures.
      5.7.9.4. NWRM Smart-Book (if utilized).
         5.7.9.4.1. The use of a Smart-Book is a local option although not required, its use is
         highly encouraged. If utilized, care must be taken to ensure the information contained
         in the Smart-Book does not contain or become “classified” in nature. Each
         organization with NWRM may generate an NWRM Smart-Book to help familiarize
         the inventory team with their organization’s NWRM. If utilized, at a minimum the
         Smart-Book shall contain:
         5.7.9.4.2. Official NWRM NSN list with all NWRM NSNs highlighted which the
         organization does and/or could possess.
         5.7.9.4.3. Consolidated list of potential NWRM with list of locations within the
         organization where the item could be found (known as the NWRM footprint).
         5.7.9.4.4. Each NWRM item listing will consist of the following:
         5.7.9.4.5. NSN.
         5.7.9.4.6. Part Number(s).
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    291


        5.7.9.4.7. Applicable Resource Control Center (RCC)/Production Section Scheduling
        Designator (PSSD).
        5.7.9.4.8. Delivery location(s).
        5.7.9.4.9. Storage location(s), including the AWP area.
        5.7.9.4.10. Maintenance location(s), where work is performed on the item.
        5.7.9.4.11. Month/Year of last time the organization had one or more of these items.
        5.7.9.4.12. A picture or drawing of each NWRM, including information on the
        location of the data plate.
     5.7.9.5. The following actions are general procedures for NWRM Semi-annual
     Inventories:
        5.7.9.5.1. In order to validate the existence of NWRM, the inventory will be a blind
        inventory, meaning the inventory officers will be provided a count card with an NSN
        and location but will not be given the serial number or the number of assets on record.
        5.7.9.5.2. A complete physical inventory of NWRM, by S/N, will be conducted on
        every NWRM with an on-hand balance in the accountable materiel management
        systems to include all detail balances, assets tracked by spreadsheets, or any assets
        that are not on an accountable materiel management system (e.g. trainers, mockups,
        simulators, test stands, displays).
           5.7.9.5.2.1. The inventory team will be taken to the respective area by escorts
           from the organization where the inventory is to take place to physically inventory
           all NWRM they find in the area.
           5.7.9.5.2.2. These inventory locations will be searched for NWRM that may have
           been misplaced to include those areas where NWRM has recently been stored or
           maintained. The objective is to perform a general sweep of these locations, not a
           “wall-to-wall” search, to find all NWRM.
        5.7.9.5.3. All NWRM will be visually verified (except when properly packaged and
        marked per AFI 20-110) and counted by serial number. The blind inventory count
        card will be filled out using asset information from the asset itself or the exterior
        packaging/tag if the asset is banded, crated, and/or sealed. The objective is to ensure
        100% accountability of all NWRM.
        5.7.9.5.4. The IO and verifying individual will both visually inspect the items
        identification information for each asset or container. The maintenance/munitions
        SME will ensure the correct serial number is identified for assets that contain sub-
        components (e.g. Aft Section). The IO will record the required information on the
        blind inventory count card and the verifying individual will verify the information to
        ensure 100% accuracy. It is essential that serial numbers are accurately transcribed (to
        include any preceding zeros) to the blind inventory count cards during the inventory.
        Note: Care must be taken to ensure the information recorded on the blind inventory
        count card is legible.
        5.7.9.5.5. If the data plate does not have all of the information needed to identify the
        asset (e.g. data plate is missing the NSN), or the item is contained in a sealed box, use
292                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         accompanying documentation (e.g. Work Control Document (WCD), DD Form 1577,
         or AFTO 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document) to get the required information
         for the count card. If documentation conflicts, then note all variations of numbers on
         the count card using subsequent lines with ‘#’ column set the same for any one item
         pending research after the completion of the inventory.
             5.7.9.5.5.1. When unable to determine the identity of an asset, contact the NTCC
             for assistance.
         5.7.9.5.6. Inventory of installed assets on accountable records.
             5.7.9.5.6.1. NWRM will not be disassembled for the sole purpose of serial
             number (SN) verification.
             5.7.9.5.6.2. These assets will be inventoried by records check. The NWRMAO
             will create a new blind inventory count card for each NSN for NWRM that are
             inventoried via a records check.
             5.7.9.5.6.3. The IO and verifying individual will complete the blind inventory
             count card using data from the accountable system and will annotate, inventoried
             by records check, in the remarks section of the count card.
             5.7.9.5.6.4. When transcribing the blind inventory count card data to the
             inventory spreadsheet, annotate in the comments section the next higher assembly
             (NHA) the asset is installed in (e.g. Trainer, Mockup, Simulator, test stand).
         5.7.9.5.7. After the inventory is complete, perform inventory reconciliation IAW the
         process in this manual.
      5.7.9.6. Inventory Count Cards
         5.7.9.6.1. The IO will document each NWRM inventoried on their inventory count
         cards. Each line on the count card will only contain one item (i.e. Qty is 1). Special
         care will be taken to ensure all leading zeros are included in SNs.
         5.7.9.6.2. If corrections are made, line out incorrect information and initial next to
         the line out.
         5.7.9.6.3. When all assets have been inventoried and the count card has remaining
         lines, draw a diagonal line through all unused rows and write “No Further Entries” on
         the line.
         5.7.9.6.4. Additional detailed instructions for filling out the count card (NWRM
         Inventory Count Card) form are provided with the official form.
         5.7.9.6.5. Once the inventory is complete, close the inventory by assigning page
         numbers (1 of 8, etc.) to the blind inventory count cards. Blind inventory count cards
         used during the inventory must be signed and dated by both the IO and verifying
         individual.
         5.7.9.6.6. NWRMAO will collect all materiel given to the inventory teams.
      5.7.9.7. Movement of assets during semiannual inventory.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 293


       5.7.9.7.1. Movement of assets must be curtailed prior to the inventory to clear the
       transportation channels and ensure that most, if not all, assets are accounted for in a
       system of record. To facilitate this effort, outbound shipments will be stopped two
       weeks prior to the start of the inventory. Internal base-level or depot-level asset
       movements (receipts, issues, due-out releases, returns) will continue through the day
       prior to the data pull for the inventory (ensure returns are processed to unserviceable
       details).
       5.7.9.7.2. The Cargo Movement will also stop all outbound shipments two weeks
       prior to the start of the inventory. They will make every effort to ensure all assets
       processed for shipment are shipped prior to this deadline. After the data pull, asset
       movements are restricted at all locations, with the exceptions noted below, until
       inventory actions are completed across the AF and NTCC has lifted the inventory
       freeze and normal activity can resume.
       5.7.9.7.3. Exceptions to asset movement restrictions:
          5.7.9.7.3.1. MICAPs: MICAP requirements for assets with available stock on
          hand will be satisfied using manual degraded operations issue procedures (Asset
          Management will not be used). MICAP requirements for assets with no stock on-
          hand will be requisitioned off-line and receipted/due-out released using manual
          degraded operations procedures (Asset Management will not be used). All
          transactions will be recorded on recap sheets for subsequent processing when the
          freeze is lifted. The NWRMAO is responsible for ensuring all degraded
          operations transactions are processed correctly and record balances, serial
          numbers, etc. match assets on-hand.
          5.7.9.7.3.2. Internal base-level asset movements (REC, ISU, MSI, DOR, TIN)
          will continue through the day prior to the data pull for the inventory
          5.7.9.7.3.3. Inventory requirements for record balance gains (receipts, returns)
          resulting from the above transactions: Assets will be inventoried using
          procedures above (general procedures for NWRM Semi-annual Inventories) and
          the following additional guidance. A new blind inventory count card will be
          created by the NWRMAO and completed by the inventory team. Enter
          explanation of record balance gain in the remarks field of the blind inventory
          count card (i.e. MICAP REC, Doc # FBXXXX91969001). These additional
          assets will not be counted when processing Inventory Recount (IRCs) transaction
          to complete ILS-S inventory processing. Asset information from the blind
          inventory count cards will be transferred to the appropriate columns of the
          inventory spreadsheet using the first blank line at the bottom of the inventory
          spreadsheet. Enter specific explanation for addition in the remarks column (i.e.
          MGS receipt, Doc # FBXXXX91960001).
          5.7.9.7.3.4. Inventory requirements for record balance losses (issues, due-out
          releases, shipments) resulting from the above transactions: Enter explanation for
          movement of asset in the remarks column of inventory spreadsheet for each
          specific serial number involved (i.e. MICAP MSI, Doc # S0050191960001).
          These assets will be counted when processing IRCs to complete ILS-S inventory
          processing, since they were on record at the beginning of the inventory period.
294                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      5.7.9.8. Inventory Procedures for Assets in Cargo Movement.
         5.7.9.8.1. Assets that have been processed for shipment but were not physically
         shipped by the Cargo Movement prior to the shipping deadline will be inventoried per
         guidance above. The NWRMAO will identify NWRM assets in the Cargo Movement
         and create a new blind inventory count card for each NSN. The IO will complete the
         blind inventory count card and enter In-transit Cargo Movement and the shipment
         document number in the remarks column. These additional assets will not be counted
         when processing IRCs to complete ILS-S inventory processing. Asset information
         from the blind inventory count cards will be transferred to the appropriate columns of
         the inventory spreadsheet using the first blank line at the bottom of the spreadsheet.
         Enter In-transit Cargo Movement and the shipment document number in the
         comments column.
      5.7.9.9. Inventory of Assets in Base Level Maintenance. Installed NWRM not on the
      Accountable Property System of Record (APSR) are not subject to NWRM inventory.
      Reference AFI 20-110, Ch 8. Note: If NWRM items are already disassembled, they will
      not be counted, but the SN/part number (PN) should be captured. The remarks section of
      the inventory count card should clearly identify these items as sub-assemblies of the end
      item they are a part of. Ensure local procedures are developed to identify NWRM assets
      disassembled for on-going maintenance actions to prevent duplication of count by
      inventory teams.
         5.7.9.9.1. Upon completion of the physical inventory, enter the inventory count total
         for each item/location (warehouse, supply point, in-use, etc.) in the blind inventory
         count cards and return to NTCC. When all inventory counts have been processed and
         matched to corresponding records, the NTCC will update process an NWRM DOLI
         Update.
      5.7.9.10. Planning and Performing Inventories in AF NWRM Storage Facilities. These
      procedures outline the process to accomplish the world-wide inventory of NWRM in
      Distribution Standard System (DSS) accounts.
         5.7.9.10.1. The Acceptable Performance Level (APL) for physical inventories of
         NWRM is 100 percent. This means that there will be zero difference between the
         physical count and record balances.
         5.7.9.10.2. Unique Item Identification (UII) numbers must be verified manually
         during the physical count process as DSS does not inventory by UII. A DSS Query
         Management Facility (QMF) generated spreadsheet should be utilized in the
         verification process of the UII numbers for each physical inventory. (See Figure 5.3
         for the spreadsheet example, and Figure 5.4 for QMF query.)
         5.7.9.10.3. All inventories of NWRM are completed by physically counting the
         stock. A paper count (recording the on-hand balance from the Quantity By Location
         record) IS NOT an acceptable practice.
         5.7.9.10.4. Physical counts will be performed by a two person (IO and verifying
         individual) dual count verification process.
             5.7.9.10.4.1. If a second or third count of a location is required, different
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  295


          individuals will perform the count. Example: Persons conducting the first count
          should not conduct the second or third count. (Second count is generated as a
          result of a first count variance. Third count is the result of a variance between the
          first and second counts.)
          5.7.9.10.4.2. A bare item inspection is not required for banded, crated, and/or
          sealed items that show no sign of tampering. Otherwise, conduct a bare item
          inspection to verify the NSN, UII, Condition Code, Unit of Issue and quantity. (If
          opening the container will compromise the condition of the materiel, do not
          perform the inspection.)
       5.7.9.10.5. Procedures must be established to ensure the NWRM inventory includes
       or meets the following:
          5.7.9.10.5.1. Schedule inventories.
          5.7.9.10.5.2. Monitor scheduling to ensure effective management of work.
          5.7.9.10.5.3. Complete NWRM inventories within two weeks of workload
          release.
          5.7.9.10.5.4. Provide NTCC with verification that all NWRM NSNs at the site
          have been inventoried.
          5.7.9.10.5.5. Track and report performance to the NSF NWRMAO.
          5.7.9.10.5.6. Report problems completing any of the Type Physical Inventory
          Codes (TPIC) G inventories to the NWRMAO.
          5.7.9.10.5.7. Coordinate the availability of an Equipment Specialist (ES) as
          required in performance of a bare item inspection/physical count.
          5.7.9.10.5.8. Notify the NWRMAO within one hour after discovery of potential
          inventory loss or gain of NWRM.
          5.7.9.10.5.9. Have all potential adjustments reviewed by the NWRMAO.
          Causative research for all adjustments requires approval at the Flag Officer/Senior
          Executive Service level.
          5.7.9.10.5.10. Conduct rapid assessment research for all potential gains and
          losses and report findings to the NWRMAO.
          5.7.9.10.5.11. TPIC. NWRM item inventories will be assigned a TPIC of G
          through the Complete Inventory Group Program in DSS.
          5.7.9.10.5.12. Report inventories of any NSN not completed, in writing, to the
          NWRMAO. The report should contain an explanation of the reason the inventory
          is incomplete.
             5.7.9.10.5.12.1. Catalog data changes and condition code changes
             automatically cancel the TPIC G inventory in DSS. If this occurs, reschedule
             the cancelled inventory and complete within the original two-week period.
             (DSS CA Dispatch report PE4X (ADD INVENTORY CANCELLATION)
             will be generated daily and may be reviewed to identify cancelled inventories
             due to cataloging or condition code changes.)
296                                                   AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            5.7.9.10.5.12.2. If a rescheduled inventory cannot be completed within the
            original two-week period, permission to extend the completion date must be
            obtained from AFMC Cataloging Activity.
      5.7.9.10.6. NWRM Inventory Scheduling Procedures in DSS
         5.7.9.10.6.1. Use the PS03 (LOCAL STRATA INPUT/REVIEW) screen to add
         an inventory request. Type Physical Inventory Code “G”, Warehouse Area, and
         Narrative (title for inventory) must be entered.
            5.7.9.10.6.1.1. After adding inventory request, confirm release of the
            inventory (PS031 screen, LOCAL STRATA SELECTIONS).
            5.7.9.10.6.1.2. The complete inventory program will run behind the scenes
            and populate the stratum. The inventory must be reviewed and accepted
            before it will release into production.
         5.7.9.10.6.2. Access the PS11 (BROWSE OPEN SAMPLE INVENTORIES)
         screen to locate and browse (or delete) the inventory that was created. DSS will
         display the PS16 (COMPLETE INVENTORY REVIEW/ACCEPT) screen, where
         the inventory may be accepted or deleted. The applicable Inventory Cut-Off Date
         (ICOD) must be entered prior to accepting the inventory.
            5.7.9.10.6.2.1. The inventories will load into the workload bank and
            subsequently release into the workload when end-of-day wrap-up runs on the
            assigned ICOD.
         5.7.9.10.6.3. Verify the group inventory was accepted by browsing the applicable
         group ID number on the blank PS11 (BROWSE OPEN SAMPLE
         INVENTORIES) screen. DSS will display the PS13 (DISPLAY IN-PROCESS
         RESULTS) screen showing the inventories were loaded into the workload bank.
      5.7.9.10.7. Physical Counting in the NWRM Storage Facility (NSF)
         5.7.9.10.7.1. For assets stored in the NSF, the IO and verifying individual will
         proceed location-by-location to stored material, find that material on the DSS-
         generated data sheets, “both” verify the information contained on the DD Form
         1500-Series tag against the DSS data, and enter the “Physical Quantity” for each
         location and the “Count Quantity” for each UII on the respective documents.
         5.7.9.10.7.2. Utilizing a Blind Count Card or DSS-generated product, annotate
         the following:
            5.7.9.10.7.2.1. National Stock Number (NSN)
            5.7.9.10.7.2.2. Date Asset Inventoried
            5.7.9.10.7.2.3. Location/Facility

               5.7.9.10.7.2.8. Use the Remarks block to annotate any discrepancies or other
               notes of interest.
               5.7.9.10.7.2.9. IO prints name, organization, phone number, and signs in the
               Inventory block. verifying individual does the same in the Verifying Officer
               block.
               5.7.9.10.7.2.10. For DSS documents, enter the quantities where required.
               5.7.9.10.7.2.11. Print, sign, date, provide office organization, and phone
               number at the bottom of each sheet. Note: SRAN and UII need not be filled
               out on the Blind Count Cards
        5.7.9.10.7.3. After the inventory documents are annotated, the IO and verifying
        individual will turn them over to the NWRMAO who will verify the counts against a
        DSS QMF-generated list. (See Figure 5.2)
            5.7.9.10.7.3.1. If the counts reconcile, the counts will be input into DSS (PE3H
            screen, ENTER INVENTORY COUNTS) by a qualified NSF DSS user.
            5.7.9.10.7.3.2. If the counts do not reconcile, a different inventory team will be
            dispatched to the location where the discrepancy exists to perform a second count.
            If that second count reconciles, the count will be input into DSS (PE3H screen).
            5.7.9.10.7.3.3. If the second count does not reconcile, the NWRMAO will
            accompany the inventory team to the location and determine the cause of the
            discrepancy and resolution.
               5.7.9.10.7.3.3.1. Counts that cannot be reconciled will be processed IAW AFI
               20-110 procedures for causative research and potential inventory adjustment.
     5.7.9.11. Inventories in Depot Organic Maintenance.
        5.7.9.11.1. These procedures outline the process to accomplish the world-wide
        inventory of NWRM items in depot organic maintenance.
        5.7.9.11.2. Maintenance Wing (MXW) personnel will inventory NWRM within their
        respective wing.
        5.7.9.11.3. The AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Activity does not
        have any NWRM in repair and these procedures do not address any NWRM assets on
        an aircraft/end-item currently in storage at AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and
        Regeneration Activity.
        5.7.9.11.4. For locations using multiple inventory teams, ensure local procedures are
        developed to identify NWRM disassembled for on-going maintenance actions in
        order to prevent duplication of count by inventory teams. Teams are highly
        encouraged to coordinate the performance of inventories to avoid duplication in
        counts.
        5.7.9.11.5. NWRM that have been removed from a NHA as part of an on-going
        maintenance action are subject to inventory. These items will be captured on a new
298                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      inventory count card and the remarks section of the count card will clearly identify
      these items as sub-assemblies of their associated NHA.
         5.7.9.11.5.1. Research will be conducted to determine the status of these items
         e.g. to be reinstalled in the NHA or it is no longer required and will be turned in,
         demilitarized, etc. These assets will be added to the inventory spreadsheet
         following the last entry under a heading “Part of Ongoing Maintenance Action.”
         The status of these assets (e.g. reinstalled in NHA, turned in) will be clearly
         identified in the comments section of the inventory spreadsheet for that item.
         These are not considered overages.
      5.7.9.11.6. NWRM that are issued to a work order for repair of an NWRM NHA.
      These assets will be documented on a new inventory count card and the remarks
      section of the count card will clearly identify these items as sub-assemblies of the
      NHA they are a part of to include the work order number. These items will be added
      to the inventory spreadsheet with a comment stating these items will be installed in a
      NHA to include the work order number.
      5.7.9.11.7. All maintenance holding areas (courtesy stores) will be inventoried, NHA
      only.
      5.7.9.11.8. Items in the maintenance repair organization (MRO) will not be frozen
      for this inventory.
      5.7.9.11.9. Inventory data will consist of physical location, SOS, manager designator
      code (MDC), NSN, Condition Code, Serial Number, and an on-hand accountable
      balance.
      5.7.9.11.10. Researching an out-of-balance scenario. Each situation may be unique,
      but there are common circumstances that could cause an out-of-balance scenario.
         5.7.9.11.10.1. Verify/validate, conduct research in the following areas for any
         discrepancies noted.
             5.7.9.11.10.1.1. Check the RINA screen in D035K for condition code Z in-
             transits, check the scheduling workbooks to verify all returns have been
             processed, etc. See process for more avenues that could cause an out-of-
             balance scenario. If the verifying individual does not have D035K access, the
             NSF RIM will check D035K information.
             5.7.9.11.10.1.2. Transaction history in D035K.
             5.7.9.11.10.1.3. Due-In for Overhaul (DIOH) Returns (document identifier
             D6M, condition code Z in-transits)
             5.7.9.11.10.1.4. Due-In for Overhaul (DIOH) Issues (document identifier
             D7M, condition code Y in-transits)
             5.7.9.11.10.1.5. Wash-post transactions
             5.7.9.11.10.1.6. The missing item may be located in awaiting parts storage
             (AWP) area, which should be checked accordingly.
             5.7.9.11.10.1.7. Review scheduling workbooks (AFMC Form 105) for
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  299


                process routes (paint shop, etc.) and match SN against the WCD.
                5.7.9.11.10.1.8. Look for exceptions in G042A, G004L and D035K.
                5.7.9.11.10.1.9. Look for found on base (FOB) receipts.
        5.7.9.11.11. If discrepancy cannot be reconciled, D/VO will complete an AFMC
        Form 37, Inventory Research Register. An inventory adjustment will not be taken by
        inventory team.
        5.7.9.11.12. Forward AFMC Form 37 to Wing NWRMAO for further research
        and/or action.
        5.7.9.11.13. The NWRMAO will continue causative research, if required, and
        forward AFMC Form 37 to the IM for adjustment action.
        5.7.9.11.14. Inventory adjustments and ROS will be passed to the IM for processing.
        5.7.9.11.15. The IM will coordinate with AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support
        Activity Item Manger (RIM) to process any adjustments.
     5.7.9.12. Planning and Performing Inventories in Contractor Facilities.
        5.7.9.12.1. Close and early coordination between the NWRMAO, AFNWC Program
        Offices, IM, Production Management Specialist (PMS), ALC Contracting (PK), the
        Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the AFMC SCM-R Activity
        NTCC is essential to ensure full understanding and cooperation from all involved
        parties to include the contractors possessing Government owned NWRM at their
        facilities.
        5.7.9.12.2. NWRMAO will:
            5.7.9.12.2.1. Assign an IO that has a basic understanding of the items to be
            inventoried.
            5.7.9.12.2.2. Provide the IO blind inventory count cards that contain the NSN and
            location of NWRM as well as an inventory spreadsheet sealed in an envelope that
            is to be used during the reconciliation.
            5.7.9.12.2.3. Coordinate with the contracting officer (CO) at least 30 days prior
            to the inventory, to notify the contractor that the inventory will be taking place.
            5.7.9.12.2.4. Instruct contractors to stop movement of assets and freeze assets as
            well as reduce transaction processing to mission essential transactions to align
            with the inventory freeze dates provided by AFMC. The contractor will provide
            the inventory team documentation of all transactions processed after the data pull
            upon arrival at the contractor’s facility.
        5.7.9.12.3. PMS (AFNWC) will: Work with the IM to ensure the inventory team has
        all the necessary information/data to facilitate a successful inventory.
        5.7.9.12.4. CO will:
            5.7.9.12.4.1. Act as a liaison to the contractor to ensure full understanding and
            compliance with the inventory requirements.
            5.7.9.12.4.2. Ascertain if special access/security clearances are required for
300                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             access to contractor facilities.
             5.7.9.12.4.3. Coordinate specific dates for the inventory and forward a formal
             written notification to the contractor.
             5.7.9.12.4.4. Contact DCMA for inventory support as necessary.
         5.7.9.12.5. The IO will plan for the inventory, conduct the inventory, perform the
         inventory reconciliation and conduct any causative research at the contractor facilities
         where the inventory took place, and report inventory results as prescribed by AFMC
         in this document.
             5.7.9.12.5.1. Ask the contractor if they are aware of other AF owned NWRM at
             their facilities. These assets will be inventoried IAW AFI 20-110 and this
             manual.
         5.7.9.12.6. The V/DO will perform the inventory along with the IO.
             5.7.9.12.6.1. Be familiar with AF inventory procedures.
         5.7.9.12.7. Program Manager will: coordinate with the CO to ensure all contracts
         include the necessary contract language outlining the requirements for semi-annual
         100% NWRM inventories.
         5.7.9.12.8. DCMA will: At larger contractor locations where a DCMA representative
         is assigned, DCMA may act as a liaison between the contractor and the inventory
         team to verify the contractor’s stated location of previously un-located items. At
         contractor facilities where no DCMA representative is assigned, the regional DCMA
         office will act in an advisory capacity providing assistance where practical.
      5.7.9.13. Reconciling Inventories.
         5.7.9.13.1. Serial number validation. Since NWRM are serialized, it is essential that
         serial numbers from the blind inventory count cards are verified against the
         accountable record to ensure 100% accountability. Asset identification info (NSN,
         serial number, condition code) from the blind inventory count cards will be validated
         against both the AFMC provided inventory spreadsheet and the system accountable
         record to ensure all data matches. If there is a discrepancy, research must be
         conducted to resolve the error.
         5.7.9.13.2. Completion of the inventory spreadsheet. Blind inventory count card data
         for assets on record will be transferred (electronically) to the inventory spreadsheet in
         the appropriate columns to the right of the pre-existing data. Blind inventory count
         card data for assets gained (receipts, returns) or in the Cargo Movement will be added
         in the first blank line at the bottom of the inventory spreadsheet. Ensure explanations
         for record balance loss asset movements are recorded in the comments column for
         each specific serial number.
         5.7.9.13.3. If physical count does not match accountable records and inventory
         spreadsheet, research must be performed IAW researching inventory discrepancy
         procedures in this section and full supporting documentation provided (in accordance
         with AFI 20-110, Ch 11).
      5.7.9.14. Researching Inventory Discrepancies.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   301


        5.7.9.14.1. The NWRMAO must research, identify, and correct, or initiate action to
        resolve, the cause of all inventory discrepancies. If the input inventory count does not
        match the accountable records balance, a physical recount is required to validate the
        initial count. The inventory team will recount the item using the procedures in this
        document and record the results on new inventory count card(s). The NWRMAO will
        then use the NWRM inventory count card(s) and inventory spreadsheet to reconcile
        the inventory to the accountable record.
        5.7.9.14.2. If the recount does not resolve the discrepancy, pre-adjustment research is
        required. Pre-adjustment research is performed to verify that the system balance is
        correct. The NWRMAO will perform a complete review of all transactions to include
        supporting documents and catalog changes, shipping discrepancies and un-
        posted/rejected documentation since the last inventory in order to validate the system
        balance and determine if a discrepancy between that balance and the count exists. If a
        potential loss cannot be resolved within 24 hours, a Report of Survey will be initiated
        and provided to the IM. Pre-adjustment research is complete when the system balance
        is verified to be correct or the adjustment quantity is determined.
        5.7.9.14.3. If upon completion of pre-adjustment research, an inventory adjustment is
        required, the IM, the NTCC, and MAJCOM A4R must be notified within 24 hours
        and provide inventory adjustment documentation for IM approval. The inventory
        adjustment documentation must be certified by the NWRMAO and approved by
        his/her appointing official (Wing/CC) per in AFI 20-110. IMs must obtain approval
        from the first Flag Officer/Senior Executive Service level in their chain of command
        prior to performing or authorizing the inventory adjustment transaction. The
        adjustment that results will change the system balance to match the final definitive
        count.
        5.7.9.14.4. Causative research must be performed on all discrepancies, resolved and
        unresolved, identified as a result of the inventory. The purpose of causative research
        is to identify the root cause of any inventory discrepancy. The NWRMAO has 30
        days to complete causative research and provide the results to the IM, the NTCC, and
        MAJCOM A4R.
            5.7.9.14.4.1. A resolved discrepancy is any discrepancy that is correctable by
            (re)processing a transaction to correct the system balance (thus bringing count in
            line with balance). An unresolved discrepancy is any discrepancy that cannot be
            corrected by (re)processing a transaction to correct the system balance.
     5.7.9.15. Analyzing and Reporting Inventories.
        5.7.9.15.1. All units will return an inventory spreadsheet and Certificate of Inventory
        to complete the inventory. The spreadsheet should be properly annotated
        (electronically) with the final verified results and returned directly to the MAJCOM
        designated POC. Units should request a read receipt to ensure the product is received
        by MAJCOM designated POC.
        5.7.9.15.2. MAJCOM POCs will quality check/review unit submitted inventory
        documentation. Consolidate information and submit an inventory documentation
        package to NTCC.

   5.7.10. Adjustment Procedures.
       5.7.10.1. Purpose: To provide instructions to adjust the accountable balance for
       unresolved discrepancies when there is a difference between the quantity of assets on
       hand and the quantity shown in the accountable balance. For IT specific guidance use
       AFH 23-123 or the ES-S User’s Manual.
       5.7.10.2. Caution: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a
       classified item constitutes a potential compromise of classified information and will be
       reported immediately upon discovery in accordance with AFI 31-401. See AFI 20-110
       for additional reporting requirements for NWRM.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   305


     5.7.10.3. Inventory variances are discovered during Complete or Special inventories or
     upon the processing of a Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5).
     5.7.10.4. Processing a Special Inventory Input may create both a decrease and an
     increase inventory adjustment record. These adjustments appear as separate entities on
     the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register
  5.7.10.5. Adjustment Documentation
        5.7.10.5.1. Inventory Adjustment Voucher (IAV). The document used to provide
        relief from property accountability and justification for the adjustment of the physical
        inventory and accounting records. An IAV will be used for the following
        circumstances:
            5.7.10.5.1.1. Unresolved discrepancies that do not meet the criteria for
            performing an investigation, where cause or probable cause was identified during
            pre-adjustment and causative research.
            5.7.10.5.1.2. Unresolved discrepancies meeting the criteria for performing an
            investigation, where no personal responsibility was found during the course of the
            investigation.
               5.7.10.5.1.2.1. The following documents may be used as IAVs:
                 5.7.10.5.1.2.1.1. AFMC Depot machine products generated by the Financial
                 Inventory Accounting and Billing System.
                 5.7.10.5.1.2.1.2. DD Form 1348-1, used within the ILS-S.
                 5.7.10.5.1.2.1.3. AF Form 85, Inventory Adjustment Voucher, used in
                 manual supply systems.
        5.7.10.5.2. Reference AFMAN 23-220 to provide relief from property accountability
        and justification for the physical inventory and accounting records. This reference
        may be used for unresolved discrepancies that do meet the criteria for an investigation
        where cause or probable cause cannot be identified during pre-adjustment and
        causative research.
        5.7.10.5.3. The DD Form 200 is the document used to substantiate inventory loss
        adjustments for the following:
            5.7.10.5.3.1. Unresolved discrepancies meeting the criteria for investigations
            where personal liability is determined.
            5.7.10.5.3.2. When authorized by appointment, the reviewing authority may
            approve physical inventory adjustments equal to or less than $50,000, when
            negligence or abuse is not evident or suspected. When negligence or abuse is
            evident or suspected, the reviewing authority initiates and forwards the DD Form
            200 to the appointing authority for action. The DD Form 200 shall be used to
            substantiate adjusting the stock record, and providing relief from property
            accountability.
            5.7.10.5.3.3. If the loss was due to theft by an unknown person(s), the
            government may not recoup funds even if an ROS was processed. Therefore, the
306                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             only purpose of the ROS would be to provide documentation for use in adjusting
             property records. In such cases, a memorandum for record or similar document
             (i.e., Security Forces report) will satisfy the AO’s desire for documentation to
             support relieving accountability for the stolen item(s).
      5.7.10.6. Supporting Documentation for Inventory Adjustment Vouchers (IAVs).
      5.7.10.6.1. IAVs must be supported by one or more of the following documents prior to
      submission for approval:
             5.7.10.6.1.1. AFMC Form 37, Inventory Research Worksheet.
             5.7.10.6.1.2. DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss.
             5.7.10.6.1.3. DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher.
             5.7.10.6.1.4. SF Form 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report.
             5.7.10.6.1.5. DD Form 1131.
             5.7.10.6.1.6. SF 364, Report of Discrepancy.
             5.7.10.6.1.7. DD Form 114, Military Pay Order.
             5.7.10.6.1.8. Other substantial documentation related to the research performed to
             support the inventory adjustment.
      5.7.10.7. Authentication of Inventory Adjustment Vouchers (IAV). Authentication of
      IAVs requires the signature of the certifying and approval officials (see Authentication of
      Inventory Adjustments and Identity Changes, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). The
      certification official signature certifies the following:
             5.7.10.7.1.1. There is no evidence of neglect, theft or property, or fraud.
             5.7.10.7.1.2. Research has been performed and differences are attributable to
             normal supply activity.
             5.7.10.7.1.3. Property responsibility and general principles prescribed by AFI 23-
             111, have not been violated.
         5.7.10.7.2. Approving official signifies that the signer is aware of the discrepancies
         reflected by the IAV, that they reflect adversely on the system involved. It will also
         reflect that positive action is being taken to correct existing discrepancies in order to
         hold IAV processing to a minimum. If any or all of the line item entries on an IAV
         are not acceptable, it will be returned to the initiator indicating the unacceptable
         adjustments with instructions that additional research be accomplished. If the
         additional research does not provide a satisfactory explanation of the discrepancy, a
         DD Form 200 will be initiated in accordance with AFMAN 23-220 of this manual.
      5.7.10.8. Inventory Adjustment of AF Property Bearing a Security Classification.
         5.7.10.8.1. Any classified item, including publications, may be listed on the IAV
         regardless of the security classification of the item.
         5.7.10.8.2. The following procedures apply when a potential variance on a classified
         item is identified:
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    307


         5.7.10.8.3. A potential variance (gain or loss) on a classified item constitutes a
         potential compromise of classified information and will be reported immediately
         upon discovery in accordance with AFI 31-401. Within the context of the inventory
         program, the identification of a potential inventory variance by the D008 constitutes
         discovery.
      5.7.10.9. A preliminary inquiry will be conducted within 10 days upon discovery of the
      potential variance in accordance with AFI 31-401.

   5.8.1. Adding/Deleting SPRAM Authorizations.
      5.8.1.1. Purpose:    To explain the procedures for Adding/Deleting SPRAM
      Authorizations. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
      guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.8.1.2. Recommendations to add or delete SPRAM authorizations are submitted by the
      requesting organization via letter to the EAE. Additions or increases require justification
      such as TO references, maintenance directives, correspondence, etc.
         5.8.1.2.1. Computation method. The method for computing the additional SPRAM
         authorized quantity should be included in the justification. Example: If a
         maintenance directive states that a quantity of two SPRAM assets is required per
         aircraft and 24 aircraft are assigned to the base, then the SPRAM quantity authorized
         under this justification would be 48.
         5.8.1.2.2. Approval. Each request for changes to SPRAM authorizations will be
         approved by the respective group commander and forwarded to MAJCOM
         headquarters for submission to the SPM. The Group Commander (or equivalent) may
         delegate SPRAM approval authority to squadron commanders. The Operations
         Group and Maintenance Group Commanders (or equivalent) may delegate SPRAM
         approval authority to the squadron commanders or senior Maintenance officer within
         squadrons. Delegation below that level is not authorized. Note: NWRM SPRAM
         approval authority will not be delegated.
         5.8.1.2.3. Documentation. A copy of each letter requesting changes to SPRAM
         authorizations must be maintained by the EAE in a folder along with the current
         SPRAM listing and the custodian appointment letter. The letters requesting SPRAM
         changes may be discarded once a new SPRAM listing signed by the SPRAM
         custodian is received.
         5.8.1.2.4. Review. All SPRAM authorizations should be reviewed annually and
         certified as valid. Certification may occur during the annual SPRAM inventory and
         may be noted on the approved SPRAM listing.
   5.8.2. Maintain SPRAM Custodian File.

             5.8.2.2.1.1. Original appointment letter; a copy is permitted as long as it is a
             direct photocopy of the original no fax copy is allowed for permanent use. A fax
             copy may be permitted if only used as a suspense copy when an off-base
             organization will be mailing either an original or photocopy to the EAE or AFMC
             SCM-R Equipment Activity.
             5.8.2.2.1.2. SPRAM request change letters, i.e., letter requesting for a change to
             existing authorized quantities, etc.
             5.8.2.2.1.3. SPRAM training certificate(s). Training certificates issued from each
             respective EAE or AFMC SCM-R Activity EME is acceptable. EAE or AFMC
             SCM-R Equipment Activity will utilize the SPRAM Training Handout provided
             by each MAJCOM CEMO for training certification.

             extension to current Annual SPRAM Inventory requirements.
  5.8.3. Load, Change, Delete SPRAM Detail Records.
      5.8.3.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures to load, change and delete SPRAM detail
      records. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific
      guidance use AFH 23-123.
      5.8.3.2. EAE personnel load, change, and delete special purpose asset detail records
      using the Load, Change, Delete SPRAM Detail Record input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
      1, Ch 5 for the input format).
         5.8.3.2.1. Load. The following is applicable:
             5.8.3.2.1.1. Use any terminal for the load, change and delete SPRAM detail
             record input. However, any input through a satellite terminal function must be for
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       309


                that specific satellite system designator.
                5.8.3.2.1.2. Load the item record for the applicable system designator, if required.
                5.8.3.2.1.3. Enter an I in position 64 of the load, change and delete SPRAM detail
                record input to call the issue program. Assets will either be issued from the item
                record serviceable balance or due-outs will be established.
         5.8.3.2.2. Change. Change the special purpose asset detail as follows by processing
         load, change and delete SPRAM detail record input with a C in position 80.
                5.8.3.2.2.1. Authorized quantity. Do not decrease the authorized quantity below
                the total quantity on hand for the prime and all substitute detail records.
                5.8.3.2.2.2. Item code. To realign the prime/substitute relationship in a group,
                change the existing substitute record to the prime record or add a new prime
                authorization. If you make this realignment, the existing prime is changed to a
                substitute if an on-hand quantity exists. If the on-hand quantity is zero, the
                program deletes the detail substitute.
                5.8.3.2.2.3. Type SPRAM flag. Input the type SPRAM flag on the prime
                authorization. This input changes all detail records with the same document
                number and system designator.
                5.8.3.2.2.4. SRD. A valid SRD must be entered on the prime detail record. This
                input will update the prime and sub detail of the SPRAM asset.
         5.8.3.2.3. Delete. Delete a special purpose asset detail record when all on hand
         balances are 0 by processing the load, change and delete input with a D in position 80
         if the on-hand balance equals zero. You cannot delete a SPRAM detail record if
         either the prime (item code P) or substitute detail records are not zero.
         5.8.3.2.4. Inquiry. Inquire a special purpose detail record by processing a load,
         change and delete SPRAM detail record input with an I in position 80. The only data
         elements required to inquire a SPRAM detail is TRIC, action code, stock number,
         system designator and document number.
  5.8.4. Manage/maintain SPRAM Management Products.
     5.8.4.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures for managing/maintaining the SPRAM
     management products. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT
     specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.8.4.2.

        5.8.4.2.7. Records of Assets Off-Base. Maintain all records of SPRAM assets that
        accompany end-items (that is, aircraft, test stations, etc.) off-station for other than
        deployments. Maintain a copy of the correspondence directing the movement of the
        assets with applicable model and serial numbers. If end-items return without the
        SPRAM assets, the depot or using location will be tasked to return the assets, provide
        a replacement, or accept accountability. Coordinate with the EAE to process returns
        and shipments to the gaining location, if required. Maintain copies of returns and
        shipment documentation until an updated SPRAM Report List is approved and filed.
        5.8.4.2.8. Relief of Accountability Documentation.       Maintain all copies of
        documentation requesting relief of accountability for assets lost, damaged, or
        destroyed until updated SPRAM Report List listing reflects all actions have been
        completed and the SPRAM Report List is signed and filed.
  5.8.5. Deploy/Transfer SPRAM Assets.
     5.8.5.1. Purpose: To explain the deployment/transfer of SPRAM procedures. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.8.5.2. A deployment is the temporary movement of assets from the home base to
     another location or base with accountability remaining at the home station. A transfer is
     the movement of assets and accountability to another location or base. When it is
     necessary to deploy or transfer SPRAM assets, the SPRAM custodian must provide the
     EAE a listing of all items to be transferred or deployed indicating the duration, location,
     and any special actions required. The custodian determines if any requirements on order
     at the time of transfer action should remain on-order or be cancelled.
        5.8.5.2.1. Authority to Deploy or Transfer. The organization commander possessing
        the SPRAM assets has the authority to deploy or transfer SPRAM assets. However,
        for management purposes, MAJCOMs retain the authority to identify specific
        SPRAM assets that require MAJCOM approval before they are deployed or
        transferred.
        5.8.5.2.2. Losing EAE. When directed by the MAJCOM to deploy or transfer
        SPRAM assets, the SPRAM custodian identifies the assets to the EAE. The losing
        EAE does the following:
            5.8.5.2.2.1. List of assets. After receiving the deployment or transfer listing from
            the custodian, logistics plans, and appropriate staff agencies, finalize the lists of
            assets to be deployed or transferred.
            5.8.5.2.2.2. Prepare the inputs necessary to deploy, return, or transfer the selected
            items (Equipment Deployment/Return Transaction/EAID Accountability
            Transfer/EAID Accountability Termination).
                5.8.5.2.2.2.1. Use the Equipment/SPRAM Single Item Deployment/Return
                Input to deploy or return single items (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for
                the input format).
                5.8.5.2.2.2.2. Use Equipment/SPRAM Accountability Transfer inputs to
                transfer single items (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) for the input
                format).     Note: EAID Accountability Transfer, EAID Accountability
312                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             Termination and Accountability Transfer transactions are not authorized for
             NWRM equipment. Contact the NWRM Transaction Control Cell for
             processing instructions.
             5.8.5.2.2.2.3. Use EAID Accountability Termination inputs for group
             selection of assets for deployment, return, or transfer. (See AFH 23-123, Vol
             2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the input format.)
         5.8.5.2.2.3. Shipping destination record. Ask Customer Support to load a
         shipping destination record for the ship-to SRAN. This provides a complete
         mailing address when shipping documents are output.
         5.8.5.2.2.4. Multi-item custody receipt transfer. When the items selected for
         transfer will be moved as a complete unit to another Supply Equipment account,
         prepare the input to show that the transfer is made as a multi-item custody receipt
         transfer. This option is only available with group processing of assets for
         deployment, return, or transfer.
         5.8.5.2.2.5. Single-item custody receipt documents. When the items selected for
         transfer will be shipped, transported, and received as individual items, use
         materiel management shipping documents. Transfers to non-Supply Equipment
         accounts are always made on materiel management shipping documents.
         Equipment Deployment/Return and EAID Accountability Transfer inputs will
         only produce materiel management output documents.
         5.8.5.2.2.6. Cover letter. Prepare a cover letter to the gaining LRS CC/AO and
         attach the following:
             5.8.5.2.2.6.1. Shipping documents.
             5.8.5.2.2.6.2. Item Record load/Load, Change, Delete SPRAM Asset Detail
             Records/ Accountability Transfer inputs (when produced by EAID
             Accountability Termination).
             5.8.5.2.2.6.3. DD Forms 1348-6 related to L and P numbered items
             transferred.
         5.8.5.2.2.7. Assets and quantities transferred. Forward to the gaining LRS
         CC/AO MAJCOM a listing of the assets and quantities transferred.
         5.8.5.2.2.8. Names of custodians. Obtain and keep the names of the custodians
         who will accompany the deployed or transferred assets and hand-carry the
         materiel management documentation.
         5.8.5.2.2.9. Due-ins and due-outs. Determine if the losing EAE should cancel
         due-ins and due-outs or keep them in the ILS-S database. Before canceling due-
         ins and due-outs, consider such factors as urgency of need by the unit before and
         after transfer, avoiding excessive shipping costs, and the availability of the item
         from base sources.
      5.8.5.2.3. Gaining EAE. When the deployed or transferred unit arrives at the new
      location, the gaining unit property custodian receives it and signs the resulting
      SPRAM Report List.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  313


       5.8.5.2.4. EAID Accountability Termination Input Options. Before processing EAID
       Accountability Termination input, EAE personnel must understand that the EAID
       Accountability Termination input has several options. For example, Item Record
       Load, Load, Change, Delete SPRAM Asset Detail Records, and Accountability
       Transfer inputs can be produced to load item records, establish special purpose assets
       detail records, and receive property. If a substitute item is deployed, manually prepare
       a Load, Change, Delete SPRAM Asset Detail Records to load a prime detail to the
       ILS-S database.
       5.8.5.2.5. End Item Transfer. The following procedures apply when an end item(s)
       (aircraft/missile) is transferred to the AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and
       Regeneration Activity. Upon notification of an end item transfer, the AFMC SCM-R
       Equipment Activity will terminate accountability for all installed and support
       equipment, SPRAM assets, and -21 technical order assets. These procedures will
       minimize the number of AFEMS (C001) reporting errors for FB/E2373 and the losing
       bases.
          5.8.5.2.5.1. Assets Transferred On-Board with the Aircraft/Missile. EAID
          Accountability Termination documents will not be processed to FB/E2373 for
          aircraft/missile installed equipment when the aircraft/missiles are transferred to
          AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Activity for retirement/storage.
          AFMC SCM-R Equipment Activity will process the EAID Accountability
          Termination/EAID Accountability Transfer documents using the losing base
          SRAN. Accountability Transfer documents will not be generated for installed
          equipment assets located on board the aircraft or missile. The reason why
          accountability ended (aircraft transferred to AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and
          Regeneration Activity for retirement/storage, aircraft tail number) will be
          annotated on the EAID Accountability Termination EAID Accountability
          Transfer output documents. Copies of the EAID Accountability Termination /
          EAID Accountability Transfer terminations will be provided to the equipment
          custodian. Copy one is filed in Document Control. The losing AFMC SCM-R
          Equipment Activity is responsible for clearing all in transit delinquent shipments
          identified by the AFEMS (C001) as a result of erroneously processing EAID
          Accountability Termination / EAID Accountability Transfer documents. Note:
          EAID Accountability Transfer, EAID Accountability Termination and
          Accountability Transfer transactions are not authorized for NWRM equipment.
          Contact the NWRM Transaction Control Cell for processing instructions. Instead
          of processing EAID Accountability Transfer, refer to Sec. 5G, Physical
          Inventory and Inventory Adjustments for processing of the inventory
          adjustment with proper supporting documentation.
          5.8.5.2.5.2. Assets which are shipped through transportation channels. Use non-
          direct shipments (not EAID Accountability Termination) according to procedures
          contained in Sec. 5C, Asset Management of this manual to ship in-use spare
          assets not transferred onboard the aircraft/missile to AFMC Aerospace
          Maintenance and Regeneration Activity for storage. Assets will be shipped to
          FB/E2373, mark for AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Activity,
          Bldg. 7401, Davis Monthan AFB, AZ. Shipment suspense details should not be

              generated. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for shipping destination record
              transaction (FRD) format
          5.8.5.2.6. Receive or transfer SPRAM. Use the Accountability Transfer input to
          process an issue to a special purpose asset detail record. It may be produced by EAID
          accountability termination processing or by manually preparing individual inputs for
          the input format (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the format).

Section 5I—Inspection and Related Operations

5.9. Inspection and Related Operations.
   5.9.1. General Requirements for Inspection and Related Operations.
       5.9.1.1. Purpose: To explain standard AF methods and procedures for inspection and
       related operations which include verifying identity, condition (as certified by
       maintenance inspectors or obvious physical damage) and status marking, tagging, and
       labeling of property at U.S. AF activities. The contents of this chapter also include
       special storage and handling to include condition and identity changes of materiel and are
       applicable to all activities unless prescribed otherwise in the individual section. For
       policy requirements review AFI 23-101, Sec. 5I, Inspection and Related Operations. For
       other policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use
       AFH 23-123.
       5.9.1.2. Caution. Under no circumstances will logistics personnel sign DD Form 1574-1
       certifying an asset as a serviceable condition item.
       5.9.1.3. Reference MIL-STD-129 and MIL-STD-130, prescribes identification marking
       requirements to be followed by contractors and AF activities. Serviceable items being
       received, stored, issued, or shipped must be identified either through original containers
       or subsequent containers. Example: 100 bolts are received into your account in one
       clearly identified package. A shipment for 10 bolts is requested from your account. The
       materiel management technician would place the 10 bolts into another container (i.e.,
       Baggie) then annotate the identification (NSN, Noun, Contract and Lot Numbers) and the
       quantity contents legibly on the new container prior to shipment, accompanied by the
       shipment s DD Form 1348-1/1A. DD Form 1574-1 can be used to identify property if the
       remark field contains the following statement: ID PURPOSES ONLY.
       5.9.1.4. The following actions will be performed:
          5.9.1.4.1. Requirements for XD (Reparable) items:
              5.9.1.4.1.1. Incoming Shipments:
                  5.9.1.4.1.1.1. Verify identification on the outside container matches DD Form
                  1348-1 or DD Form 1348-1/1A. If the outside container does not match the
                  DD 1348-1/1A, the container must be opened to properly identify the item. If
                  the actual property does not match the DD Form 1348-1/1A, submit a Supply
                  Discrepancy Report (SDR)/Reports of Discrepancy (ROD) as outlined in AFI
                  23-101, Sec. 5I, Inspection and Related Operations.
                  5.9.1.4.1.1.2. Ensure condition paper work is located on the outside of the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       315


                  container. If condition paperwork is not located on the outside of the container
                  but the item identification is matched according to Para 5.9.1.4.1.1.1 and
                  there is no suspected damage, the DD Form 1348-1/1A will suffice as
                  condition paperwork. The DD Form 1348-1/1A must be affixed to the outside
                  container for originator tracing purposes. No further labeling/tagging or
                  opening containers are required. Exception: Items of sufficient size to make
                  stenciling more appropriate due to outside storage and exposure to weather, or
                  when stenciling is preferred by AF activities. When stenciling is accomplished
                  in lieu of tagging, the minimum information will be the data contained on DD
                  Forms 1574/1574-1 (inspector’s name/signature or the inspector’s stamp
                  certifying the condition of the asset on the outside of the container).
                  5.9.1.4.1.1.3. If serviceability or condition of property cannot be identified or
                  is in question, an SDR must be processed prior to acceptance into the ILS-S
                  outlined in AFI 23-101, Sec. 5I, Inspection and Related Operations.
              5.9.1.4.1.2. Incoming Returns:
                  5.9.1.4.1.2.1. Ensure DD Form 1574 series tag is completely filled out and
                  contains a legible signature from a certified maintenance inspector stating the
                  identification of the asset and the condition is placed on the outside of the
                  container. If DD Form 1574 series tag is placed on the outside of the container
                  no further labeling/tagging or opening of containers are required. Exception:
                  Items of sufficient size to make stenciling more appropriate due to outside
                  storage and exposure to weather, or when stenciling is preferred by AF
                  activities. When stenciling is accomplished in lieu of tagging, the minimum
                  information will be the data contained on DD Forms 1574 series tag
                  (inspector’s name/signature or the inspector’s stamp certifying the condition
                  of the asset on the outside of the container).
5.9.1.4.2. Not Used.
          5.9.1.4.3. General requirements for both reparable and expendable items:
              5.9.1.4.3.1. Open packages with single items of supply received in vendor-sealed
              containers for additional inspections or tagging as to the condition and or
              identification when subjected to one or more of the following actions:
                  5.9.1.4.3.1.1. Property has been used; been rendered incomplete; suffered
                  obvious or suspected damage, deterioration, corrosion; or had latent defects
                  disclosed.
                  5.9.1.4.3.1.2. Condition or status of the property has been changed by
                  direction of higher authority.
                  5.9.1.4.3.1.3. Identification of the property has been lost, defaced, or
                  obliterated.
                  5.9.1.4.3.1.4. The container shows evidence of possible damage to the
                  materiel, or the item history dictates inspection action is required regardless of
                  pack.
316                                                       AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


            5.9.1.4.3.1.5. When the maximum operating time of the item is limited and
            partial service life has been accrued but the item is returned to serviceable
            stock after minor repair under the provisions of TO 00-20-3, Maintenance
            Processing of Reparable Property and Repair Cycle Asset Control System.
         5.9.1.4.3.2. For bare items utilize the item identity plate if available.
         5.9.1.4.3.3. To validate identity of an asset cross reference the assets part number
         with catalog records utilizing Master Item Identification System (MIICS) and/or
         Federal Logistics Data
      5.9.1.4.4. Original Containers affected by conversion to national stock numbers
      (NSNs) or superseded by new codes or NSNs:
         5.9.1.4.4.1. Do not open solely for application of new Stock List Change data
         (SLC) while in storage.
         5.9.1.4.4.2. Identify proper SLC data except in those instances when it is not
         economically feasible to remark each container in storage, due to quantity
         involved. In such instances, a sufficient quantity will be identified and re-tagged
         to facilitate issue and inventory.
            5.9.1.4.4.2.1. Mark the location adequately with the use of a bin card to
            indicate that some items have not been retagged. When issues or shipments
            are made, all items and /or unit packs, as well as outside or intermediate
            containers, will be marked with the current SLC data (MIL-STD-129).
      5.9.1.4.5. Use the correct DD Form 1570 series tag IAW TO 00-20-3 to prepare all
      authorized DD Form 1570 series tags/labels to include DD Form 1574, DD Forms
      1575, Suspended Tag-Materiel, DD Forms 1576, Test/Modification Tag-Materiel,
      and/or DD Form 1577, Unserviceable (Condemned) Tag-Materiel.
         5.9.1.4.5.1. Prepare by imprinting or by mechanical equipment if equipment is
         available and installation is authorized.
         5.9.1.4.5.2. Prepare tags and labels manually by use of lead pencil, rubber stamp
         or non-smear ball-point pen when small quantities are involved or mechanical
         equipment is not available.
            5.9.1.4.5.2.1. In instances where condition tags or labels would be subjected
            to conditions that would cause the ball-point pen ink to run or become
            illegible, the use of ball-point pen will not be utilized.
      5.9.1.4.6. Use MIL-STD-129 and/or MIL-STD-130 for marking and identification.
         5.9.1.4.6.1. MIL-STD-129 provides the minimum requirements for uniform
         military marking for shipment and storage. Marking is the application of
         numbers, letters, labels, tags, symbols, or colors on containers or packaging to
         provide identification and expedite handling during shipment and storage.
         5.9.1.4.6.2. MIL-STD-130 provides the guideline that requires product
         identification nameplates, product identification labels, and product identification
         tags be designed in a specific way.

            5.9.1.4.7.1. May be utilized to identify the contents of containers having only one
            line item and which are stored outside or being shipped overseas.
            5.9.1.4.8.1. Metal embossing plates:
                5.9.1.4.8.1.1. May be utilized for applying item description and other data to
                forms, tags, labels, listings, etc., at AF installations where equipment is
                authorized and available.
        5.9.1.4.9. Activity Supply Inspector:
            5.9.1.4.9.1. Will ensure that all materiel received, stored, issued, or shipped is
            properly identified, and the legibility and permanence of the information
            contained on tags, labels, and other markings are maintained.
     5.9.1.5. Condition and Item Management Data Changes. Changing the condition,
     identity, or item management data of assets may be needed under certain circumstances.
     The document flow for Document Flow for Condition/Identity Change (FCC or FCH) is
     described in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
        5.9.1.5.1. Condition Changes. Processing Condition Changes (FCC) is described in
        AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
     5.9.1.6. Suspect Materiel. AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance will coordinate stock
     screening action requests received from the Air Force Discrepant Materiel Program
     Office (AFDMPO) DLA, GSA, Depot item managers, Air Staff, etc.
        5.9.1.6.1. AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity will suspense supported
        LRS/Materiel Management Activities to perform stock screening actions and will
        maintain all stock screening notifications and screening results received from the
        bases until suspect flags or exception control data is removed.
        5.9.1.6.2. Supported LRS/Materiel Management Activities must also maintain
        documentation on suspect items loaded at their location.
  5.9.2. Processing Identity Changes.
     5.9.2.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures for processing identity changes. For policy
     specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     5.9.2.2. Use the identity change processing to re-identify a specific item or quantity of
     supplies from one stock number to another when it is recorded on the item record, EAID,
     or a SPRAM detail record. Note: Identity changes are not allowed for vehicles and
     WRM while on EAID. Process a return to stock before the identity change input is
     processed. The item can may be issued back to the appropriate EAID under the new
     NSN.
        5.9.2.2.1. Identity Changes. Identity changes may be used to correct the identification
        of serviceable items in storage, but they should be very rare. When possible, reverse-
        post processing will be used to correct the identification of items on detail records.
318                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         The identity change of a Weapon or CCI/ COMSEC asset will not be allowed.
         Processing Identity Changes are described in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
         5.9.2.2.2. Item Management Data Changes. Some item management data changes
         (e.g., controlled item code changes) will automatically cause the generation of
         warehouse change documents. Warehouse personnel must process warehouse change
         documents as quickly as possible. Warehouse Change Documents are described in
         AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
      5.9.2.3. Whoever identifies that there is a discrepancy between the item/detail record’s
      stock number assignment in the ILS-S and what the asset’s actual stock number is
      physically (also known as misidentified) will notify a qualified inspector (as deemed by
      AFI 23-101, Sec. 5I, Inspection and Related Operations). Note: Normally, the qualified
      inspector for assets on equipment and SPRAM details is aligned under EAE. Whereas,
      the qualified inspector for all other assets is from the Inspection Element.
      5.9.2.4. The qualified inspector will:
         5.9.2.4.1. Inspect the asset to confirm it is misidentified. Exception: The LRS
         CC/AO may, at his/her discretion, determine that an asset does not have to be
         physically inspected by an LRS/Materiel Management Activity inspector if sufficient
         information is provided by E-mail, fax, or other means.
         5.9.2.4.2. If the asset is misidentified, research the ILS-S to ensure the discrepancy
         cannot be resolved by other means (i.e., record reversal, return, etc.). Extreme care
         should be taken when processing an identity change since it creates both a decrease
         and an increase inventory adjustment record.
         5.9.2.4.3. Re-tag/label the property.
         5.9.2.4.4. Ensure the identity change meets the criteria specified in Processing
         Identity Changes, AFH 23-123, V2, Pt 1, Ch 5 prior to initiating any transaction
         processing.
         5.9.2.4.5. Coordinate with EAE to ensure changes are made to equipment and
         SPRAM details as necessary IAW Sec. 5D. Note: Items that are deployed cannot be
         re-identified, but the remaining on-hand quantities can be re-identified.
         5.9.2.4.6. Process the identity change transaction in the ILS-S. See AFH 23-123, Vol
         2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for SPRAM Identity Change, Identity Change Input, and EAID/In-Use
         Identity Change Input and output formats.
         5.9.2.4.7. Take corrective action(s) as prescribed by AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 if
         the transaction rejects.
         5.9.2.4.8. Create a suspense file and forward the identity change document to
         warehouse storage or EAE personnel, as applicable. Ensure asset is relocated; new
         location is assigned; and location is entered on DD Form 1348-1A, as appropriate.
         5.9.2.4.9. Upon receipt of returned document, annotate the reason for change in
         blocks 26-27 of DD Form 1348-1A (continue on reverse side of form if needed. For
         suspect materiel, AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance will coordinate stock screening
         action requests received from the Air Force Discrepant Materiel Program Office
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    319


        (AFDMPO) DLA, GSA, Depot item managers, Air Staff, etc. sign identity change
        document (i.e., DD Form 1348-1A) as prescribed AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5,
        Quick Reference Guide For DD 1348-1A Quality Control Edits.
        5.9.2.4.10. Obtain the appropriate official’s certification and approval as prescribed
        by AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, Authentication of Inventory Adjustments and
        Identity Changes, if applicable.
        5.9.2.4.11. Forward completed documentation as follows:
            5.9.2.4.11.1. Copy 1 to Document Control for filing IAW Sec. 5E, Docment
            Control and Detail Records of this manual.
            5.9.2.4.11.2. Copy 2 to custodian (for equipment and SPRAM identity change
            inputs).
            5.9.2.4.11.3. Copy 3 to EAE jacket file (for equipment and SPRAM identity
            change inputs).
  5.9.3. Processing Assets for Maintenance Functional Check.
     5.9.3.1. Purpose: To explain the procedures for processing maintenance functional
     checks. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance
     use AFH 23-123. The types of assets requiring function checks fall into two categories:
        5.9.3.1.1. Assets (other than buildup items) requiring extensive functional checks
        before installation.
        5.9.3.1.2. Serviceability of an asset is in question. Assets that appear to have been
        mishandled while in stock, dropped, etc. or assets received in a suspect condition.
     5.9.3.2. Responsibilities.
        5.9.3.2.1. Supply Inspectors normally manage the functional check program for the
        LRS CC/AO. At the option of the LRS CC/AO or the MAJCOM, the functional
        check program for readiness spares packages may be managed separately.
        5.9.3.2.2. The LRS CC/AO and the Chief of Maintenance will jointly agree on an
        individual to act as the Maintenance contact point.
     5.9.3.3. Identification of items requiring functional checks before installation. The
     Maintenance contact point for functional checks will prepare a listing of all items
     requiring extensive functional checks before installation and forward a copy of this list to
     supply Inspection. This listing is usually in the form of a signed letter. All listings,
     letters, etc., submitted by Maintenance point of contact will be kept on file in Inspection
     until the superseded or items no longer require functional checks.
        5.9.3.3.1. Inspection of items requiring functional check. Upon receipt of the listing,
        Inspection personnel do the following:
            5.9.3.3.1.1. Process an inquiry to determine the location of all assets on the
            listing, including interchangeable assets.
            5.9.3.3.1.2. Physically inspect all assets on the inquiry to determine if the local
            maintenance activity has already performed the functional check. The appearance
320                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             of a base maintenance inspector's stamp/signature is adequate proof of the
             function check. If Inspection personnel find any assets requiring a functional
             check, they process them in accordance with paragraph 5.9.3.4.
             5.9.3.3.1.3. Process FCD inputs to load or delete the functional check flag for
             those items identified on this listing.        (See Stock Control Data –
             Load/Change/Delete Input (FCD), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for FCD
             format.) The FCD input changes all master and interchangeable items in the
             group having the same system designator.
             5.9.3.3.1.4. At the option of a MAJCOM, DD Form 1576 or 1576-1 may be used
             for items that require in-stock functional checks; otherwise, annotations will be
             made on either the DD Form 1574 or 1574-1 to indicate in-stock functional
             checks are required.
             5.9.3.3.1.5. Remove the distinctive markings from the bin labels for those items
             requiring deletion.
         5.9.3.3.2. Processing Items Requiring Functional Checks.           When Inspection
         personnel find an item for which the local maintenance inspector has not indicated the
         condition of serviceability by stamping or signing the DD Form 1574, they contact
         the maintenance contact point or Production Control to determine when the asset(s)
         can be scheduled for a functional check.
             5.9.3.3.2.1. Receive time and place of delivery. Maintenance contact point tells
             Inspection personnel what maintenance shop will perform the functional check
             and when the functional check can be conducted.
             5.9.3.3.2.2. Issue to Maintenance. Process an ISU or MSI using activity code C
             and the organization and shop code furnished by Maintenance point of contact.
             Note: Process MSI for assets accounted for on MRSP, MSK, WRM, or supply
             point detail records. See Issue From Detail Record (MSI) Processing Instructions,
             AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for MSI format.
             5.9.3.3.2.3. Deliver items. Deliver the items to the appropriate shop where they
             will be controlled under normal DIFM procedures until returned to Supply. If
             these items need repair, the required bits and pieces will be charged to the
             repairing shop.
             5.9.3.3.2.4. Return from Maintenance. When maintenance returns the item to
             supply, process a turn-in (TIN) based on the condition of the item and the action
             taken code. See Recoverable Item Turn-In Request (TIN), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt
             1, Ch 6 for the TIN format.
      5.9.3.4. Processing Assets of Questionable Serviceability. When the serviceability of
      any asset is in doubt, the supply Inspectors will place the item in a suspect condition and
      process the item to maintenance using the functional check process.
         5.9.3.4.1. Issue to Maintenance. Issue the suspect item to maintenance using MSI
         with activity code C and the organization and shop code furnished by maintenance
         point of contact. The issue to maintenance results in no financial updates to the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     321


          organization’s O&M funds because of the suspect condition code and the C activity
          code.
          5.9.3.4.2. Return from Maintenance. Credit will be allowed based on the
          serviceability of the item and the action taken code as indicated below:
              5.9.3.4.2.1. Serviceable with Action Taken Code B. When maintenance
              determines the item is serviceable (condition code A) and performs no repair
              (action taken code B) process the turn-in (TIN) with a suspect condition code and
              then change the condition of the asset from suspect to serviceable process using a
              Condition Code Change input (FCC). This process prevents crediting the
              maintenance organization for repairs it did not perform. See Processing
              Condition Changes, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the FCC format.
              5.9.3.4.2.2. Serviceable with Action Taken Code Other than B.                When
              maintenance determines the item was unserviceable and repairs the item (action
              taken code indicating repair, other than B) process the TIN as serviceable to allow
              the maintenance organization to receive credit for the repair performed.
              5.9.3.4.2.3. Unserviceable.    When maintenance determines the item is
              unserviceable and performs no repair, process the TIN as unserviceable.
              Maintenance will not receive any credit for the return of the unserviceable item.
      5.9.3.5. Functional Checks Listing. Program NGV401 with the functional check listing
      option (or an equivalent local program) will be processed as required, but at least
      semiannually. A copy of the output will be forwarded to both the Maintenance point of
      contact and Inspection. Upon receipt of the listing, Inspection personnel do the
      following:
          5.9.3.5.1. Check this listing against the previous listing and with letters submitted by
          Maintenance point of contact.
              5.9.3.5.1.1. Thoroughly research items added to or deleted from the previous
              listing.
              5.9.3.5.1.2. If no requests from Maintenance point of contact are on file, ask the
              Maintenance point of contact to verify the additions or deletions.
          5.9.3.5.2. Update the present listing manually or request a new listing when new
          additions or deletions are requested. The number of changes required should
          determine whether to manually update the listing or request a new one.
          5.9.3.5.3. Provide a copy of the Functional Check Listing to Receiving for use during
          degraded operations.

Section 5J—Management of Discrepant, Counterfeit and Suspect Counterfeit Materiel

5.10. Management of Discrepant, Counterfeit and Suspect Counterfeit Materiel.
   5.10.1. Discrepant, Counterfeit and Suspect Counterfeit Materiel Procedural
   Reference. Purpose: To provide reference to AF policy guidance and procedures regarding
   the management of discrepant, counterfeit and suspect counterfeit materiel. For policy
   specific requirements review AFI 23-101; other authoritative sources for discrepant materiel
 322                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


   are cited in this instruction. This guidance identifies requirements for non-conforming or
   malicious materiel reporting, investigating, and resolution processes.
   5.10.2. Discrepant materiel management procedures are delineated in TO 00-35D-54, USAF
   Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution.

Section 5K—Stock Positioning.

5.11. Stock Positioning.
   5.11.1. Asset Redistribution.
       5.11.1.1. Purpose: Describe the processing actions for Stock Control or designated
       personnel to manage RDO/Referral suspense detail records.
       5.11.1.2. RDO/Referral suspense details will appear on the Base Supply Surveillance
       Report (D20), part 13 and the RDO Metrics Report (M22) (Reference Surveillance
       Report (D20/NGV821) and Redistribution Order (RDO Metrics) (M22/NGV885) in AFH
       23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5). These listings provide management with the capability to
       manage and track all incoming RDO/Referral orders when they are in a suspended status.
       Interrogation of the RDO/Referral suspense details can also be accomplished by
       processing a 16 ALL inquiry or an inquiry with retrieval code “T.”
       5.11.1.3. The management of RDO functionality within ES-S is designed to operate with
       little to no manual intervention. Users can view the ES-S Audit Trail Component (ATC)
       entries to determine the disposition of each RDO transaction. User can create a list of all
       RDO suspense details from any base account (based on AFSCDB data), list rejected
       RDOs, determine if RDO rejects were cleared without reprocessing (assuming the clear
       was processed through ES-S), and also determine if a record reversal and correction on
       the shipment was performed. The following action should be performed:
       5.11.1.4. When a wholesale-directed redistribution transaction (A2*/A4*) is processed in
       the ILS-S, the system checks for serviceable base assets. If serviceable base assets exist,
       then the RDO/referral order is subjected to a series of rules, based upon the priority of the
       redistribution transaction, to determine what base assets may be released for shipment.
       Basically the rules ensure base assets will only be redistributed to bases with higher
       priority needs. Those asset release rules are detailed in Redistribution Order (RDO)
       Asset Release Rules in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
          5.11.1.4.1. If base assets are available to satisfy the RDO/referral, but some or all of
          the required assets are “inaccessible” for immediate shipment, the ILS-S creates an
          RDO/referral suspense detail (220) detail. There are numerous reasons why
          serviceable assets may be suspended. For instance, RDO/referral suspensions can
          occur due to ongoing physical inventory actions, out of warehouse storage locations,
          because the serviceable assets are deployed in an MSK, and when an external
          management decision is required. The RDO/referral suspense detail is maintained in
          the ILS-S until the redistribution action is either honored or denied.
          5.11.1.4.2. When an A2*/A4* is suspended, either an I136 or I023 management
          notice is produced and forwarded to Stock Control.  See Common RDO (A2*),
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  323


       Referral Order (A4*), And Excess Disposition Shipment (FTR) Rejects and
       Corrective Actions in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for common RDO rejects.
       5.11.1.4.3. Process a query to determine if the 220-RDO-QTY can be satisfied from
       other assets or substitute NSNs.
       5.11.1.4.4. Personnel should check the numeric source coded item in D043 to
       determine what the source code was before it was locally tailored. If the source code
       is preferable to the source code on the input stock number (including consideration of
       the item jump-to-code) then the item can be shipped to satisfy the RDO. If research
       indicates the asset cannot be shipped, then take action to deny the RDO. Numeric
       source codes indicate that the interchangeable and substitute group (I&SG) has been
       locally tailored, and the item may or may not be in a subgroup that is usable in lieu of
       the requested stock number.
       5.11.1.4.5. Re-input RDO (A2*/A4*) transactions to either honor or deny suspended
       redistribution/referral orders. See Redistribution/Referral Order (A2*/A4*) Input in
       AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
          5.11.1.4.5.1. Re-input RDOs with TEX code asterisk (*) to ship a substitute NSN
          or to honor RDOs with off-base supply point or deployed MSK assets. However,
          before using TEX “*,” personnel should ensure that the A2*/A4* satisfies the
          asset release rules detailed in Redistribution Order (RDO) Asset Release Rules
          AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. Note TEX “*” is note authorized for RSP details.
          Failure to re-input suspended RDOs with the “*” could cause duplicate
          RDO/Referral suspense details. When using TEX code “*,” re-input the original
          A2*/A4*, with the following changes:
          5.11.1.4.5.2. If shipping from an MSK or supply point detail, use the NSN and
          the quantity that will be released from the detail. Use the suffix code from the
          RDO/Referral suspense detail. If MSK or supply point assets are available, then
          Stock Control can ship (A2*/A4*) the asset directly off the appropriate detail or
          the assets can be turned in and shipped off the item record by re-inputting the
          A2*/A4*. Stock Control should normally ship directly off the detail in lieu of the
          return/ship process.
          5.11.1.4.5.3. If shipping a substitute item, use the substitute NSN and the quantity
          of the substitute NSN that will be released for the RDO. Use the suffix code from
          the RDO/Referral suspense detail.
       5.11.1.4.6. Re-input the applicable denial code into the TEX code field of the
       A2*/A4*. The TEX code field is a dual purpose field and must reflect the appropriate
       denial code. See authorized denial codes in Redistribution Order Denial (B7*)
       Transaction Format in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
       5.11.1.4.7. If a referral order (A4*) is partially or completely denied either
       programmatically or manually, the ILS-S outputs a supply status (AE*) transaction
       with “CB” status.

      5.11.1.4.8. When ICPs that initiated RDOs and referral orders have not received
      status from the shipping bases, the ICPs follow-up to the shipping bases for updated
      status.
         5.11.1.4.8.1. When AFMC or contractor ICPs has not received status from a
         shipping base indicating when (or whether) an RDO has been honored, the ICP
         sends a redistribution order follow-up (BF7) transaction to the shipping base. The
         redistribution order follow-up transaction format is provided in ILS-S Responses
         to RDO and Referral Order Follow-ups in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. The
         ILS-S response to these wholesale redistribution order follow-up transactions
         depends upon whether the base has received the RDO, and if so, whether the
         RDO has been honored. The ILS-S responses to ICP RDO follow-ups are
         provided in ILS-S Responses to RDO and Referral Order Follow-ups, AFH 23-
         123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
         5.11.1.4.8.2. Referral order follow-ups. ICPs who initiate referral orders can
         follow-up to shipping bases via MILSTRIP follow-up (AF*) transactions. Refer
         to Reply To Redistributable Order Follow Up Shipment Status (BL7) in AFH 23-
         123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for a reference to MILSTRIP follow-up output (AF*)
         transactions. See ILS-S Responses to RDO and Referral Order Follow-ups, AFH
         23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for details regarding the ILS-S responses to referral
         order follow-ups.
      5.11.1.4.9. Initiators of RDOs and referral orders communicate cancellation requests
      via AC* transactions. See Requisition Cancellation Request (AC1/AK1) Output
      Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the format for AC* transactions.
      When RDO or referral order cancellation request transactions are input, the ILS-S
      attempts to locate a shipment suspense or SNC detail with an equal document number
      and suffix code; or an RDO/referral suspense detail. The action taken by the retail
      system depends upon what details are found. See ILS-S Responses to RDO and
      Referral Order Follow-ups, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for a complete explanation
      of the ILS-S responses to RDO/referral order cancellation requests.

                                    MATERIEL RETURNS

Section 6A—Overview

6.1. Overview. This chapter outlines AF guidance for performing supply chain materiel
management processes associated with materiel returns and disposal of materiel. These activities
include Returns and Disposal. DoD 4100.39-M, Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS)
Procedures Manual, DoD 4140.1-R, DoD 4160.21-M, and DoD 4160.28-M-V2, Defense
Demilitarization Manual, Demilitarization Coding serve as primary DoD reference sources.

Section 6B—Returns

6.2. Returns.
   6.2.1. Material Returns to the Retail Supply Activity.
       6.2.1.1. Purpose: To explain return procedures. For policy specific requirements
       review, AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. Caution: Classified
       items will be handled IAW AFI 31-401.
       6.2.1.2. Return requests will be processed without delay.
       6.2.1.3. The following actions will be performed for all returns:
           6.2.1.3.1. Perform physical bare item inspection of property (identaplate, engraving,
           decal, or label) to ensure proper identification of asset IAW MIL-STD-130. Ensure
           materiel received matches supporting documentation and ILS-S records.
                6.2.1.3.1.1. If property identification does not match information in the ILS-S,
                review interchangeable/substitute data within the system or research in the D043B
                Interchangeable and Substitute (I&S) maintenance system.
                6.2.1.3.1.2. If I&S data is       not compatible, action may dictate use of
                Interchangeability Code I for return processing.
           6.2.1.3.2. Interchangeability Code I. Use extreme discretion in processing Due-in
           From Maintenance (DIFM) returns with Interchangeability Code I. Improper
           processing will lead to incorrect inventory control.
                6.2.1.3.2.1. The submitting organization will create a memorandum certifying the
                item returned is acceptable to clear existing DIFM records; this memorandum will
                include supporting documentation such as TO’s or service manuals.
                6.2.1.3.2.2. The FSC will use this information to verify the item returned is
                acceptable for the item issued and should not be or is not linked in the applicable
                Interchangeable Substitute Group. All supporting documentation will be filed
                with a copy of the D20, Base Supply Surveillance Report for a period of two
                years.
326                                                     AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      6.2.1.3.3. Property Preservation. Ensure all returns are protected with packaging
      identified in Special Packaging Instruction (SPI) information, DD Form 1348-1A and
      AFMAN 24-206_IP, Packaging of Materiel.
      6.2.1.3.4. Sign and date customer copy of the original DD Form 1348-1A, Issue
      Release/Receipt Document or AF Form 2520, Repair Cycle Control Log upon receipt
      and completion of bare item inspection.
      6.2.1.3.5. Review the AFTO Form 350. Review the AFTO Form 350 accompanying
      repairable returns for completeness and compatibility IAW TO 00-20-2. Coordinate
      with the applicable Maintenance Reparable Processing Center for clarification or
      correction of any questionable or incomplete entries.
         6.2.1.3.5.1. Block 16 must contain the original issue request or due-out release
         document number listed on the DD Form 1348-1A or equivalent.
         6.2.1.3.5.2. Block 17 must contain the nomenclature of the item.

         6.2.1.3.5.4. Block 18a, must contain the WUC when the item is declared NRTS
         or condemned (Action Taken Codes 0 through 9).
         6.2.1.3.5.5. Block 19 must contain the National Stock Number.
         6.2.1.3.5.6. Block 20 must contain an Action Taken Code compatible with
         property condition. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 for a list of Action Taken
         codes.
         6.2.1.3.5.7. Block 21 must contain the Quantity.
      6.2.1.3.6. AFTO Form 350 Disposition. Leave Part 1 of the AFTO Form 350 tag
      attached to the item. Part II of the AFTO Form 350 will be used for return processing
      actions.
      6.2.1.3.7. Condition tags. Verify the accuracy of condition tags affixed to the repair
      cycle asset IAW TO 00-20-3.
      6.2.1.3.8. Removal of Tags and Labels. Remove all documentation not pertaining to
      current transaction (i.e., previous shipping labels, issue documents, MICAP, NMCS,
      999, etc.). Tags and labels must be obliterated or removed from the item’s container
      prior to the item being shipped, reissued or returned to warehouse stock.
      6.2.1.3.9. AF Form 2005 and processing instructions. If return is not processed in an
      automated tracking system, prepare an AF Form 2005. The procedure for preparing
      the AF Form 2005 depends on the type of item being turned in, as outlined in other
      sections of this chapter. The format and processing instructions for consumable
      (XB3) item return requests are provided at AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6, Processing
      Turn-In of Consumable Items. The format and processing instructions for
      recoverable (XD2) and equipment (NF/ND) items are provided at in AFH 23-123,
      Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6, Recoverable Item Turn-In Request (TIN). Ensure the AF Form
      2005 contains all required entries, including the DOCUMENT CONTROL,
      Classified, or NWRM stamp; after processing, forward it immediately to Document
      Control.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       327

               processing is delayed for more than 1 duty day, enter a P in Repair Cycle Flag
               position 53. Record the last three positions of the Julian date (actual return date)
               in Tote Box/Hold Bay positions 4-6 of the Return input.
           6.2.1.3.10. Handling Post Return Processing. After completing return processing,
           move material with correct automated tracking labels and applicable documentation
           to locally designated hold areas or applicable warehouse stockrooms.
   6.2.2. Special Return Procedures.
        6.2.2.1. Purpose: These procedures cover returns that require special action. For policy
        specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
        6.2.2.2. Materiel Deficiency Returns. Process Materiel Deficiency Returns IAW TO 00-
        35D-54.
           6.2.2.2.1. Maintenance personnel (originator) will deliver the deficient exhibit to the
           LRS/Materiel Management Activity IAW TO 00-35D-54, specifically:
               6.2.2.2.1.1. A copy of the initial deficiency report (DR) submittal paperwork.
               6.2.2.2.1.2. Provide documentation for DR to include latent defects found after
               initial exhibit reporting
               6.2.2.2.1.3. Two completed copies of the DD Form 1575, Suspended Tag –
               Materiel
               6.2.2.2.1.4. Two copies of the DD Form 2332, Product Quality Deficiency
               Report Exhibit properly completed IAW TO 00-35D-54 with the deficient
               property at the time of return.
           6.2.2.2.2. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will verify maintenance has
           provided required documentation and unserviceable (ERRCD X**) item returns are
           identified with supply condition code Q and action taken code C.
        6.2.2.2.3. Upon completion of return processing, the appropriate ILS-S produces
        management notice I012 (Stock Awaiting Disposition) reflecting the unserviceable detail
        document number. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will attach a copy of the
        I012 management notice to the property and write the Report Control Number (RCN) on
        the I012 so the exhibit can be readily identified.
           6.2.2.2.4. Move the exhibit to the deficiency report storage location.
           6.2.2.2.5. Assign location to R920 detail.
        6.2.2.3. Warranty Item Returns. Include all warranty paperwork when an items is

        6.2.2.4. Items Undergoing Physical Inventory. Inventory freeze codes (C for Cycle
        inventory and I for Special inventory) will not affect processing of unserviceable returns.
        However, inventory freeze codes will have the following effects on serviceable return
        processing:
            6.2.2.4.1. If TEX code 7 or G is used to force shipment, the system will process the
            return and shipment of the property.
            6.2.2.4.2. If the entire quantity can be due-out released, the system will process the
            return and release the due-out.
            6.2.2.4.3. If neither of these conditions exist, reject 469 will be printed. Take the
            following actions:
                6.2.2.4.3.1. Hold copy 1 of the 469 reject in suspense and re-input the return after
                freeze code is removed.
                6.2.2.4.3.2. Forward copy 2 of the 469 reject to the holding area, where it will be
                attached to the property.
        6.2.2.5. Found on Base (FOB) Item Returns. Assets in the possession of base customers
        not accounted for on supply system due-in from maintenance or in-use equipment detail
        records are commonly referred to as found on base (FOB).
            6.2.2.5.1. Determine ownership. The following research actions will be performed
            for all FOB returns to determine ownership: Verify all warehouse locations and
            detail balances; review transaction history for previous adjustments to validate if
            FOB is related; and check Degraded Operations log sheets to verify all transactions
            have been processed. After research, if ownership of FOB property can be
            determined, return the property to the owning organization.
            6.2.2.5.2. Specific FOB Actions. The FSC will ensure all research actions are
            documented and filed with a copy of the D20 when an item is found on base and
            ownership cannot be determined, follow actions in Para 6.2.3 and process the return
            with TEX code “+” (see Table 6.2 for exceptions). All research actions will be
            documented and filed with a copy of the D20, BASE SUPPLY SURVEILLANCE
            REPORT for a period of two years. Use the following table for additional actions:

Table 6.2. Exceptions to TEX code “+” Returns.

Serialized control assets (i.e.       These assets will not be turned-in with a TEX +
NWRM, CCI/COMSEC and                   (plus). Use Special Inventory procedures and
Weapons) or Classified                    customers will follow Report of Survey
                                        guidance in AFMAN 23-220. For NWRM,
                                        immediately contact the NTCC to determine
                                       proper accountability/disposition actions. Also
                                           see AFI 20-110, Ch 11 for discrepancy

     6.2.2.6. Readiness Spares and Supply Point Item Returns. These assets are “returned” to
     retail supply stocks, and the materiel return procedures are the same as those used for
     customer materiel returns. Use the activity code, Organization Code, Shop Code and
     serial number of the Readiness Spares or Supply Point detail for processing the return.
     6.2.2.7. Controlled Item and Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Returns
        6.2.2.7.1. Write or stamp CLASSIFIED ITEM in red ink on all copies of classified
        item source documents. For NWRM equipment, stamp the AF Form 2005 with
        CLASSIFIED NWRM in red ink.
        6.2.2.7.2. LRS/Materiel Management activities will research and verify the serial
        number and part number/stock number conversions for all controlled materiel turned-
        in without the serial number or national stock number physically identified on the
        item.
        6.2.2.7.3. Serialized Control Returns. When processing a return that affects the total
        on-hand or detail quantity, follow normal processing procedures. However, if
        processing a transaction for a partial quantity, specific serial numbers must be
        identified before the in-line transaction is processed. Use TRIC XHB or DSR
        detailed in COMSEC Serialized Control Input (XHB) and Small Arms Reconciliation
        Report For AFMC (DSR) respectively in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10.
        6.2.2.7.4. NWRM Returns. In addition to instructions in Para 6.2.1, NWRM returns
        will be processed using the following procedures:
            6.2.2.7.4.1. The FSC will ensure only personnel authorized by the NWRMAO
            process NWRM return transactions.
            6.2.2.7.4.2. FSC/return processing activities will notify NTCC of processing
            actions when an NWRM is being returned.
            6.2.2.7.4.3. The FSC will provide the NTCC the NSN, the part number,
            document number, quantity, unit of issue, and applicable serial number(s).
            6.2.2.7.4.4. The NTCC will lift freeze code “S” via Freeze Code Update (FFC)
            processing, and notify the requesting FSC the freeze code has been removed.
            FSC will process the TIN. After successful processing, NTCC will inform
            IM/repair facility of pending shipment and reload the freeze code “S”.
            6.2.2.7.4.5. Do NOT process returns for NWRM with a TEX 7 and
            Supplementary Address. This will prevent automatic bypass of the freeze code.
            6.2.2.7.4.6. If return processing releases to a backorder, FSC will provide final
            destination detail (SPRAM, Equipment, Supply Point, etc.) of the asset(s). All
            excess POS assets will be redistributed based on direction from the Item Manager
            (IM).
            6.2.2.7.4.7. If return processing released to an unserviceable hold detail, contact
            the NTCC to process a Shipment (SHP) or Wholesale Activity Redistribution
            Order /Referral Order (A2x/A4x) to the correct address.
            6.2.2.7.4.8. NTCC will update webpage In the future, Positive Inventory Control
            (PIC) Fusion Center will have visibility of transactions automatically.

      6.2.2.8. Parachute Returns. In addition to instructions in Para 6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3,
      parachute returns will be processed using equipment returns detailed in Para 6.2.5 and
      the following procedures.
         6.2.2.8.1. Parachute components found to be unserviceable as a result of inspection
         performed in accordance with applicable technical orders will be processed as
         follows:
         6.2.2.8.2. Reparable and serviceable parachutes and components of the following
         stock numbers, which are excess to AF requirements, will be converted to training

         parachute assemblies are conspicuously stenciled in indelible ink: "NOT FOR
         FLIGHT - GROUND TRAINING ONLY." Unserviceable components may be
         stenciled during the technical order inspection performed by maintenance.
         6.2.2.8.6. Disassembled Parachutes.      If disassembling parachutes, the EAE,
         responsible custodian, and owning activity must work together to ensure the
         parachute is properly taken apart, identified and accounted for on separate DIFM
         details before taking it to the FSC.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  331


        6.2.2.8.7. EAE will determine what parts make up the assembled parachute and then
        prepare the documents listed below. Process these documents in the exact order
        listed. Note: Although these documents are basically "paperwork" transactions,
        output DD Form 1348-1A will be distributed in the normal manner.
            6.2.2.8.7.1. Activity Code E Return (Assembled Parachute). This return transfers
            the parachute from the in-use detail to the item record. EAE will prepare and
            process the return with the following information: Supply condition code A;
            transaction exception code (TEX) 8; and PARCHUTDSAMBLY in positions 67-
            80. If necessary, prepare an FCI to adjust authorizations.
            6.2.2.8.7.2. Activity Code P Issue (Assembled Parachute). This issue removes the
            parachute from the item record balance. EAE will prepare and process the issue
            with the following information: Activity code P; organization code 004; shop
            code AD; and PARCHUTDSAMBLY in positions 67-80.
            6.2.2.8.7.3. Activity Code P Return (Parachute Component). For each parachute
            component, EAE will prepare and process the return using following data:
            Activity code P; organization code 004; shop code AD; condition code A; and
            TEX code 8.
            6.2.2.8.7.4. Activity Code C Issue (Parachute Component). For every activity
            code P return prepared for a component, EAE will prepare and process an
            activity code C issue. In positions 67-80, enter the in-use document number of
            the parachute. Use the disassembling activity's organization and shop code to
            establish DIFM control on component items. Note: The activity disassembling
            the parachute must sign each activity code C issue. Other issues or returns will be
            signed by EAE.
        6.2.2.8.8. Return and Disposition of Parachute Components. After parachute
        components have been associated to a unique DIFM detail, the disassembling activity
        will return any serviceable, reparable, or condemned parachute components to the
        FSC.
     6.2.2.9. Return of Bench Mockups or Sets. The equipment custodian must state
     disassembly is complete when returning a bench mockup or set. Follow equipment return
     procedures using activity code E, for returns of each component of the mockup or set.
     6.2.2.10. Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM). Returns for
     SPRAM items must contain demand code I (when reducing or deleting authorized detail)
     or demand code R (when requesting replacement item).
     6.2.2.11. Safe and Filing Cabinet Returns. Return documents for safes and filing
     cabinets with combination locks will include combination settings. When locksmith
     services are available, the combination settings will be changed to 50-25-50 prior to
     return. If a locksmith is unavailable, returns may be accomplished without changing
     combination settings. If so, in addition to writing the settings on the return document,
     also notate the combination on the tag or label attached to the safe or cabinet.
     6.2.2.12. Multiple DIFM Indicator. When using a multiple DIFM indicator, there is only
     one DIFM document number. Additional processing will be required if returning partial
332                                                           AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      quantities or using separate conditions. Example: DIFM quantity is 10. If returning five
      each with an action taken code 9, and the other five with an action taken code B, it will
      be necessary to process separate returns with the same document number.
      6.2.2.13. Non-accountable equipment. Non-accountable equipment GPC purchased
      items must be processed through the ILS-S to ensure the assets are not on any
      accountable records. Process returns for non-EAID equipment items that do not affect in-
      use detail records. The requester provides the org/shop code. Materiel Management
      personnel will process the return using:
         6.2.2.13.1. Activity code “P” document numbers.
         6.2.2.13.2. Activity code “K” from retail outlets.
         6.2.2.13.3. Credit code “N”. Note: Credit code “Y” is assigned when credit is
         allowed, the Funds manager must approve the use of credit code “Y” before
         processing
         6.2.2.13.4. Contact EAE for items on EAID details
  6.2.3. Recoverable, Consumable, or Equipment Return Procedures.
      6.2.3.1. Purpose: To provide procedures on the return of recoverable, consumable, or
      equipment items. For policy specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT
      specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      6.2.3.2. In addition to guidance in see Para’s 6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3), follow instructions in
      subsequent paragraphs for recoverable (ERRCD XD2 or XF3), consumable (ERRCD
      XB*/NF1), or equipment (ERRCD N**) returns to the ILS-S.
      6.2.3.3. Recoverable Item Returns. Return recoverable items after completing the base
      repair cycle process IAW TO 00-20-9, Forecasting Replacement Requirements for
      Selected Calendar and Hourly Time Change Items. In addition, all recoverable returns
      will follow procedures in Para’s 6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3 and recoverable return transaction
      processing outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6.
      6.2.3.4. Consumable Item Return Procedures. In addition to Para’s 6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3
      and consumable return processing outlined in Processing Turn-In of Consumable Items
      AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 perform the following actions for all consumable item
      returns:
         6.2.3.4.1. AFI 23-101 and DoD 4160.21-M mandates all government materiel must
         be fully used and reused whenever it can be effectively, economically, and safely
         utilized. Although activities or work centers may no longer need consumable assets
         for current needs, they are not authorized to automatically throw away these items
         because they may be needed in the future. The following general guidelines will help
         determine item usefulness and applies to both on and off-base organizations.
         6.2.3.4.2. Throw Away Items. Customers may only throw away items that are in
         such a deteriorated condition they cannot be sold through DLADS, thus making them
         useless for any future application. Examples are used gaskets, seals, broken plastic
         items, etc.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     333


        6.2.3.4.3. Useful materiel. Customers will collect, retain, and return to the
        LRS/Materiel Management Activity all consumable items, serviceable or
        unserviceable, having potential use or resale value. The LRS/Materiel Management
        Activity will reissue and redistribute these for repair and reuse, or transfer to DLADS
        as scrap.
        6.2.3.4.4. The return activity will prepare and sign DD Form 1574. The return
        activity will write appropriate organization and shop code on the DD Form 1574 or
        the property container. The DD Form 1574 is not required on a consumable item if
        the item is in its original sealed container, and the national stock number has not been
        removed or obliterated.
        6.2.3.4.5. LRS/Materiel Management Activity will not accept serviceable property
        less than a full Unit of Issue (UI). If returned serviceable property contains less than
        a full UI (i.e., 57 EA and the UI is HD), the organization will keep the items as work
        order residue or add them to existing bench stock.
  6.2.4. Specific Consumable Processing Procedures.
     6.2.4.1. Purpose: To provide procedures on certain consumable returns. For policy
     specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     6.2.4.2. IAW AFI 24-203, Cargo Movement personnel will check each collection/pickup
     point on base, according to the schedule set by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity.
     They will deliver recovered consumable materiel to FSC for processing.
     6.2.4.3. Use the organization and shop code identified on the DD Form 1574 or container
     to make sure funds credit is provided when authorized. Property suspected to be
     unserviceable or misidentified will be verified by a certified inspector. Process
     unserviceable returns as condition code “H.” If items are considered scrap, process IAW
     Sec. 6C, Disposal and Demilitarization of this manual. After processing, move
     materiel to applicable hold location.
  6.2.5. Equipment Return Procedures.
     6.2.5.1. Purpose: To provide procedures on the return of recoverable, consumable, or
     equipment items. For policy specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT
     specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     6.2.5.2. In addition to Para’s 6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3 and equipment return processing
     outlined in Processing Turn-In of Equipment Items To ILS-S, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
     Ch 6 the following actions will be performed for all equipment returns:
     6.2.5.3. The organization equipment custodian will contact EAE to request return of
     accountable equipment items. Additionally, the custodian will prepare two copies of AF
     Form 2005 for return processing.
  6.2.5.4. The EAE:
        6.2.5.4.1. Reviews the equipment custodian’s AF Form 2005 for accuracy.
        6.2.5.4.2. Queries the ILS-S to identify unfilled base authorizations for the item.
            6.2.5.4.2.1. If unfilled base authorizations exist:
 334                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                  6.2.5.4.2.1.1. If a due-out exists, EAE will contact the customer to verify the
                  item returned will be acceptable to their requirements. If so, ensure the
                  correct document number is annotated on AF Form 2005 used for return with
                  TEX 2.
                  6.2.5.4.2.1.2. If no due-out exists, EAE will transfer the serviceable item to
                  the existing base authorization.
                  6.2.5.4.2.1.3. If there are no unfilled base requirements, EAE will obtain
                  disposition instructions from the Item Manager. When disposition instructions
                  are provided, EAE will ensure the correct DODAAC is annotated on the AF
                  Form 2005.
       6.2.5.5. Documented Cargo Operations will pick up the property from custodian. Sign
       and leave a copy of the AF Form 2005 with the custodian. Deliver the property and
       remaining AF Form 2005 copies to FSC for Return transaction processing IAW Para’s
       6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3.

Section 6C—Disposal and Demilitarization

6.3. Disposal and Demilitarization.
   6.3.1. Disposal.
       6.3.1.1. Purpose: To explain disposal procedures process required to transfer materiel
       (TRM) to DLADS for managing excess and surplus material transfers.              Materiel
       transfers from AF retail materiel management activities to DLA can be either directed by
       wholesale inventory control point (ICP) item managers, or can be initiated based upon
       disposal decisions by local managers. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-
       101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
       6.3.1.2. Overarching disposal guidance is contained in DoD 4160.21M.
       6.3.1.3. General Disposal Procedures. Locally-directed materiel transfers to DLADS are
       processed in the ILS-S when items are no longer required (excess), all disposal authority
       criteria has been met, and the item does not support an active AF weapon system or end
       item. The following action will be performed for all items being transferring to DLADS
       through LRS/Materiel Management Activity channels.
          6.3.1.3.1. Identify the type of property for disposal by checking NSN and/or Part
          Number. Reference AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 for clarification.
          6.3.1.3.2. Ensure all the paperwork if applicable, is complete (e.g. hazardous forms,
          disposition instructions, and condition tags with property).
          6.3.1.3.3. Input of a locally-directed materiel transfer, the ILS-S applies transfer
          disposal authority criteria to ensure the materiel qualifies for transfer. The transaction
          format and processing instructions for transferring items are provided at AFH 23-123,
          Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6.
          6.3.1.3.4. Successful processing of the transfer transaction produces a DD Form
          1348-1A output A5J transfer document, reference Preparation of DD 1348-1A,
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 335


        (ISU/MSI/DUO/DOR/A2x/SHP/A5J Documents) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6,
        Transfer Document.
        6.3.1.3.5. Attach document to the property. Note: DLADS is sometimes located off-
        base and the transferred materiel must be transported.                     Go to
        http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/ to request an appointment to bring scrap or
        usable property to nearby DLADS.
        6.3.1.3.6. If document contains demilitarization codes F, G or P forward to
        Inspection for processing and coordination materiel movement with LGRD
        6.3.1.3.7. For Wholesale-Directed Transfers to DLADS Transactions reference
        Processing Procedures For ICP-Directed Transfers to DLADS, AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
        Pt 1, Ch 6.
     6.3.1.4. For Critical Safety Items (CSI) materiel which lacks required supporting
     documentation will be mutilated prior to being transferred. The term “AFTO Form 95
     Required” will be printed on all output shipments or transfer documents requiring
     supporting historical maintenance data. LRS/Materiel Management Activity inspector
     should contact maintenance when this phrase is printed on serialized reparable items and
     no maintenance documentation is available.
        6.3.1.4.1. A criticality code of “E” or “F” identifies an item as CSI, in IAW DoD
        4100.39                        M,                       Vol                    10,
        http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/410039m/410039m_vol10.pdf
        6.3.1.4.2. DLADS will mutilate CSIs not accompanied by an AFTO Form 95 or
        other historical maintenance record, and if the items have not already been mutilated.
        6.3.1.4.3. When disposing such aviation CSIs into DLA, ensure that the documents
        clearly annotate that the part is "defective," "non-reparable," or "time-expired" and
        that mutilation is required. Note: If the materiel is new/unused and still packaged in
        the original manufacturer’s container that reflects all of the identification and
        contracting data, the item shall be issued or turned-in to DLA without applying the
        mutilation requirement.
        6.3.1.4.4. CSIs that contain military offensive or defensive capabilities shall be
        demilitarized in accordance with DoD 4160.28-M.
     6.3.1.5. Disposal of Special Access Program parts will comply with AFI 16-701, Special
     Access Programs.
  6.3.2. Disposal Return Document (DTID).
     6.3.2.1. Purpose: To explain Disposal Return Document/materiel transfer procedures
     used by base organizations to process directly to DLADS. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     6.3.2.2. These procedures are primarily used to transfer scrap to DLA by authorized base
     organizations. Since organizational transfers of materiel to DLADS are not processed
     through the ILS-S, the initiating organizations are responsible for hand scribed or typed
     DD Form 1348-1A documenting the transfer. There are two methods available for
336                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      producing the documentation. Organizations will use DLA’s Electronic Return Document
      (ETID) system or manually produce the transfer shipment documentation if IT is limited.
      6.3.2.3. General Disposal Procedures. Property shall be turned in to the DLADS Site
      IAW DLM 4000.25-1-M, and DoD 4160.21-M, Ch 3 all returns will be on DD Form
      1348-1A.
         6.3.2.3.1. Segregate scrap materiel to minimize DLA handling costs and to ensure
         maximum returns from the sale of disposed materiel. Segregation of scrap materiel
         shall be accomplished by the base organizations initiating materiel for all transfers.
         6.3.2.3.2. If purchased items using Government Purchase Card (GPC), organization
         will contact LRS/Materiel Management Activity to ensure the assets are not on any
         accountable records. For “Scrap Materiel,” organization will make every effort
         possible to return the items directly to DLADS.
         6.3.2.3.3. Property shall be turned           in    using    the   DLADS      Site   at
         https://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/.
         6.3.2.3.4. For password access see additional information link.
         6.3.2.3.5. The requesting organization must coordinate with DLADS to schedule
         property drop off/pick-up
         6.3.2.3.6. When an ETID is prepared by an IM to process excesses at more than one
         storage location, separate forms will be prepared for each location. Each form will
         contain indicative information for the property held only at that location. Ensure
         quantity to be transferred and retention quantity entries are complete.
  6.3.3. Batch Lot Processing.
      6.3.3.1. Purpose: To explain the batch lot procedures. For policy specific requirements
      review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
      6.3.3.2. In some cases, bases are authorized to transfer useable low dollar value materiel
      to DLADS in “batch lots” instead of individual stock number (item) transfers. Note:
      Batch lotted property documents are not in Web Docs and will be mailed back.
      Reference DoD 4160.21-M, Ch 3 above for more information.
      6.3.3.3. General batch lot procedures. Property shall be collected in a standard tri-wall
      container or other suitable container but must not exceed the dimension of a standard box
      pallet. Place containers in a convenient location within each warehouse and when the
      container is full or the warehouse supervisor considers it desirable, an ETID will be
      prepared and the container forwarded to the DLADS. The following types of property do
      not qualify for batch lot processing:
         6.3.3.3.1. Munitions List and Strategic List Items IAW DoD 4160.28-M, V2,
         Defense Demilitarization Manual, June 2011.

         6.3.3.3.5. Hazardous property.
     6.3.3.4. The following procedures will be performed:
         6.3.3.4.1. Generating activities transferring property to a DLADS site will prepare an
         ETID to accompany the property.
         6.3.3.4.2. Click     on       link        and          submit        the       request.
         https://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/.
  6.3.4. Demilitarization Procedures.
     6.3.4.1. Purpose: To explain demilitarization for selected items. For policy specific
     requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
     6.3.4.2. Demilitarization of selected items must be performed by the disposing activity
     prior to transfer to preclude the unauthorized use of military items; destroy the military
     advantages inherent in certain types of property; render dangerous property harmless;
     protect the national interest; and preclude the compromise of security requirements IAW
     DoD 4160.28M, V2.
     6.3.4.3. General DEMIL Procedures: The following actions will be performed:
         6.3.4.3.1. LRS/Materiel Management Activity inspection personnel will contact IM
         personnel to obtain guidance when DEMIL codes on DD Form 1348-1As appear to
         be incorrect or cannot be determined. If an IM cannot be identified, contact DLADs
         in accordance with DoD 4160.21-M.
             6.3.4.3.1.1. When inspection personnel detect incorrect demilitarization codes,
             they forward documents showing the changed demilitarization requirement to
             Records Maintenance, who will resolve the coding conflict.
         6.3.4.3.2. For items assigned DEMIL code F, Inspection is responsible for initiating
         correspondence to obtain demilitarization instructions from the IM/ICP.
             6.3.4.3.2.1. Inspection personnel ask Central Storage to segregate and/or mark
             property destined for shipment pending response from the IM/ICP.
         6.3.4.3.3. For items assigned DEMIL code G before they can be transferred:
         Inspection is responsible for monitoring demilitarization, subsequent transfer, and
         related documentation.
             6.3.4.3.3.1. Inspection personnel ask the following activities to establish a point
             of contact for carrying out demilitarization:
                6.3.4.3.3.1.1. Munitions Maintenance and/or Armament Maintenance, for
                ammunition and explosives.
                6.3.4.3.3.1.2. HAZMAT Pharmacy/BES or Civil Engineer, for radiological,
                biological, and toxicological materiel.
                6.3.4.3.3.1.3. Aircraft Maintenance for aircraft related items.
                6.3.4.3.3.1.4. Other activities as required.
         6.3.4.3.4. Upon receipt of a shipping document, the inspector contacts the applicable
         function and arranges for the required demilitarization. Note: DoD 4160.28-M, V2
 338                                                            AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


           establishes the criteria for determining          the most      appropriate    means    of
           demilitarization.
              6.3.4.3.4.1. The inspector stamps or types the following certificate on the
              shipping document before the property is moved to the disposing activity:

Figure 6.1. Inspector Certification.
I certify that demilitarization has been accomplished as prescribed in chap,_____para.____ there
is/is no residual materiel of salable quality. Residual materiel is/is not downgraded to scrap/
waste/destroyed.
Signature:
Organization:
Base:
           6.3.4.3.5. The function carrying out the demilitarization accepts temporary
           accountability for the property by signing and returning copy 8 of the shipping
           document to the Inspection section. Inspection personnel hold this copy in suspense
           until the demilitarized property and/or related documentation have been returned.
           They then destroy copy 8.
           6.3.4.3.6. The activity demilitarizing the item completes the certification as follows:
              6.3.4.3.6.1. If, after demilitarization, the property retains its original identity
              (only key points have been demilitarized), the certifying agent specifies 1) that the
              item has been demilitarized, 2) that there is residual materiel, and 3) that such
              materiel has not been downgraded to scrap. The certifying agent then returns the
              residual property and related documentation to the LRS, who then ships it to the
              DLADS.
              6.3.4.3.6.2. If, after demilitarization, the property does not retain its original
              identity (it has been crushed or destroyed), the certifying agent specifies 1) that
              the item has been demilitarized, 2) that there is or is not residual materiel of
              salable quality, and 3) that such materiel has been downgraded to scrap or waste.
                  6.3.4.3.6.2.1. If the residual materiel is of salable quality, the certifying agent
                  circles the stock number in print positions 8-22 of the DD Form 1348-1A,
                  enters the word SCRAP, and returns the residual materiel and related
                  documentation to Supply for later shipment to the DLADS.
                  6.3.4.3.6.2.2. If the residual materiel is not of salable quality, the agent circles
                  the stock number in print positions 8-22 of the DD Form 1348-1A, enters the
                  word WASTE, and returns ONLY the documentation to LRS.
              6.3.4.3.6.3. If, after demilitarization, there is no residual materiel (as in
              explosives), the agent certifies 1) that the item has been demilitarized, 2) that
              there is no residual materiel of salable quality, and 3) that the residual materiel
              has been downgraded or destroyed. The agent then circles the stock number in
              print positions 8-22 of the DD Form 1348-1A, enters the word DESTROYED,
              and returns the documentation to LRS.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      339


            6.3.4.3.7. Inspection personnel forward shipping documents containing a
            demilitarization certificate and the word WASTE or DESTROYED in print positions
            8-22 to Document Control. Note: No DLADS signature is required. Inspection
            personnel process shipping documents containing a demilitarization certificate and
            the word SCRAP in print positions 8-22 for delivery to the DLADS.

       specific guidance use AFH 23-123.
       7.2.1.2. General Request Procedures. The following actions will be performed for all
       base level MMHS/SAS requests:
       7.2.1.3. Requirements Call. Annually, third quarter of the fiscal year, AFMC performs a
       requirements call requesting final validation of all upcoming fiscal year projects and
       submission of new projects. MAJCOM Program Managers receive the requirements call
       data. New and updated concept papers are required for each project identified during the
       requirements call.
          7.2.1.3.1. Concept Paper. New MMHS/SAS projects require a concept paper.
          Projects will not be budgeted without a current concept paper. The concept paper is a
          one page summary of deficiencies and requested improvements. It contains specific
          background information, requested improvements, present system(s), anticipated
          benefits/impact and base point of contact. All concept papers will be developed and
          submitted electronically. A Sample Concept Paper can be found in AFH 23-123, Vol
          2, Pt 1, Ch 7. Once the concept paper is complete, submit to MAJCOM Program
          Manager for validation and prioritization.

Section 7C—Supply Chain Materiel Management System

7.3. Supply Chain Materiel Management System. The Supply Chain Materiel Management
System Section covers system interfaces and reject management.
   7.3.1. Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) Interface.
       7.3.1.1. Purpose: This section provides the procedures and identifies the processes
       required for the ILS-S and the CMOS interface. Following a brief explanation of the
       SBSS and CMOS interface, the specific procedures and processes are identified.
          7.3.1.1.1. SBSS/CMOS Interface. The SBSS/CMOS interface establishes an
          electronic interface between the SBSS and base transportation activities. The
          interface provides base transportation organizations with timely data to effectively
          plan and schedule shipments into the transportation pipeline, to control shipment
          limits to maximize the use of transportation resources, and to reduce transportation
          costs. In addition, it allows transportation to preplan shipment consolidation and
          select the mode of shipment based on priority. CMOS provides electronic record
          images to the SBSS when transportation receives outbound cargo, and it continues to
          provide shipment status information to the SBSS until the cargo is released for
          shipment. The SBLC ICI is the primary mechanism used to pass messages and
          transactions between the ADS.
       7.3.1.2. General Procedures.
          7.3.1.2.1. Responsibilities.
              7.3.1.2.1.1. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity. The AFMC SCM-R
              Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for ensuring an ADS-Interface
              Record is loaded, see ADS-Interface Record, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 6 for
              transaction format.
              7.3.1.2.1.2. Satellite Accounts.      Satellite accounts are responsible for
              coordinating the load of the CMOS indicator with AFMC SCM-R Records
              Maintenance Activity to establish the SBSS/CMOS interface.
          7.3.1.2.2. Material Management IT system processes.
              7.3.1.2.2.1. Acknowledgment of Receipt. The SBSS/CMOS interface eliminates
              the requirement for a signature on the shipment documents processed from the
              SBSS to base transportation. Base transportation acknowledges receipt of a
              shipment to the SBSS with an electronic image of a shipment suspense record
              from the CMOS which updates the shipped not credited detail (SNC). It also
              updates the shipment suspense detail (SSC) with an inchecker code and inchecked
              date. Note: When the CMOS flag is loaded, document control cards (DCC) are
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                345


          not produced for shipment documents except for classified items. See Sec. 5E,
          Document Control and Detail Records of this manual for more information on
          document control procedures for shipments both with and without CMOS
          interface.
          7.3.1.2.2.2. Directed and Nondirected Shipments. The SBSS provides CMOS
          with an electronic image of a shipment interface record for all outbound
          shipments. This record contains the shipping information printed on the DD
          Form 1348-1A which provides the CMOS with all the transportation data required
          to incheck materiel and process outbound cargo (see SBSS-to-CMOS Shipment
          Interface Records, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7). Note: When the collocated
          activity option is used, a shipment interface record is not provided to CMOS. A
          document control card (DCC) is produced.
          7.3.1.2.2.3. Transfer to DLADS. When transportation channels are used to
          transport property transfers to DLADS, the SBSS provides CMOS with an
          electronic image of a shipment interface record, see SBSS-TO-CMOS Shipment
          Interface Records, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7. However, when the
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity makes the delivery to DLADS, a shipment
          interface record is not provided to CMOS. See SBSS-TO-CMOS Shipment
          Interface Records, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7 for loading a DRMO-TMO
          delivery flag to the OCCR. (Note: Delivery flag still uses old office symbol
          identifiers, i.e. not DLADs or Cargo Movement)
          7.3.1.2.2.4. Off-Base Issues. When materiel is routed to an off-base organization
          through the base transportation office, the SBSS provides an electronic image of
          the shipment interface record to the CMOS for issues and due-out releases (TRICs
          ISU, BSU, MSI, and DOR).
          7.3.1.2.2.5. Reverse-Post Processing. When a directed or nondirected shipment,
          transfer to DLADS, or off-base issue is processed through the base transportation
          office and is reverse-posted, the SBSS provides an electronic image of a Record
          Reversal Record to the CMOS (see Record Reversal Record, AFH 23-123, Vol 2,
          Pt 1, Ch 7).
          7.3.1.2.2.6. Follow-up Processing. An electronic image of a Follow-up Action
          Record (see Follow-up Action Record, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7) is
          provided to CMOS when a receipt of acknowledgment, inchecker code and
          inchecker date for an off-base shipment, transfer to DLADS, or off-base issue is
          not received by the SBSS in a timely manner. The first follow-up occurs when
          the inchecker code and inchecker date in the SSC or SNC detail is blank and the
          date of last transaction is older than 5 days. When a response is not received from
          CMOS, a second follow-up occurs when the date of last transaction is older than
          10 days.
          7.3.1.2.2.7. Delinquent Shipment Listing, Part 5 lists SSC/SNC details with a
          blank inchecker code/inchecked date when the date of last transaction is greater
          than 14 (Delinquent Shipment Listing (R40/NGV810), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
          Ch 6) for more information on the Delinquent Shipment Listing). This report
          provides management with a list of off-base shipments, transfers to DLADS, and
346                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             off-base issues processed to the Base Transportation Office when a receipt of
             acknowledgment, inchecker number, and inchecker date have not been received
             from CMOS.
  7.3.2. Integrated Maintenance Data System Central Database (IMDS CDB/G054) and
  Core Automated Maintenance System For Mobility (CAMS-FM/G081) Interface.
      7.3.2.1. Purpose: To provide the procedures and identify the processes required for the
      Material Management IT system interface with IMDS CDB and CAMS-FM/G081.
      7.3.2.2. Implementation of these processes does not change the current organizational
      structure.
      7.3.2.3. Only selected transactions are permitted to be processed from a maintenance
      work center terminal. In IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM, maintenance personnel have the
      capability to order parts, cancel their own requirements, retrieve current status, and
      review canceled requirements through remote terminals located in the work center area.
      7.3.2.4. Manual operations will be used if the interface is suspended for long periods of
      time.
      7.3.2.5. Software. The SBLC ICI is the primary mechanism used to pass messages and
      transactions between the ADS.
      7.3.2.6. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Implementation. Ensure the following actions are
      accomplished prior to IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM activation:
         7.3.2.6.1. Validate and update those SRDs that the IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM unit will
         use to ensure they are loaded in the SBSS SRD table (008 record). See SRD Inquiry,
         AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for the input/output format of SRD Inquiry.
         7.3.2.6.2. Validate and update the IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM organization record to
         ensure the IMDS CDB-GANG-NBR (the gang number they will be using for their
         inputs) and the 518-Maint-Unit-Ident-Code are loaded. See OCCR, Load, Change, or
         Delete, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for the Organization Cost Center Record
         Load/Change/Delete/Inquiry format and entry requirements.
         7.3.2.6.3. Use The ADS Interface Record handler to establish the SBSS/ IMDS
         CDB/CAMS-FM interface. The information required for this screen consists of
         IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM gang number, their host system ID, and of course, the SBSS
         information as well. See ADS-Interface Record, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7 for
         the format.
      7.3.2.7. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Activation/Deactivation.
         7.3.2.7.1. To activate IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM contact the ICI Monitor at the DMC to
         ensure that the ICI authorization file can accommodate proper SBSS/IMDS
         CDB/CAMS-FM gang number correlation and that the SBSS host-ID and IMDS
         CDB/CAMS-FM host-ID are correct.
         7.3.2.7.2. To deactivate IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM interface, process ADS Interface
         Record to delete IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM interface record. See ADS-Interface
         Record, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7 for the format.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   347


      7.3.2.8. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM to SBSS Processes.
          7.3.2.8.1. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Transaction Identification Codes (TRICs). IMDS
          CDB input terminals are restricted to the following TRICs:
              7.3.2.8.1.1. Issues. Activity code J is assigned to issue requests for IMDS
              CDB/CAMS-FM support units.

Table 7.1. Activity code J serial number assignment.
Assigned to      Serial Number           For

     LRS              8000-8999              Off-line transactions for IMDS CDB units
     LRS              9000-9999              Off-line transactions for CAMS-FM units
              7.3.2.8.1.2. Demand code I (initial issue) is not authorized for use by IMDS
              CDB/CAMS-FM.
          7.3.2.8.2. Due-out release. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM is restricted to force release
          (TEX code 3) TCTO items only.
          7.3.2.8.3. Due-out cancellation.
          7.3.2.8.4. Maintenance Turn Around
          7.3.2.8.5. MICAP Notifications to correct indicative data or to report cannibalization
          actions taken, to preclude, satisfy, or transfer (from one end-item to another ) MICAP
          conditions.
          7.3.2.8.6. Changes to DIFM and Unserviceable Details (DFM).
          7.3.2.8.7. Bench Stock Issue Requests.
          7.3.2.8.8. Due-In/Due-Out Update. Maintenance is authorized to change only the
          following data elements: delivery destination, due-out document number, and mark-
          for.
      7.3.2.9. SBSS to IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Outputs. The outputs from SBSS to IMDS
      CDB/CAMS-FM are in the form of due-out status notifications, management notices, and
      reject notices.
          7.3.2.9.1. Due-Out Status Notifications. The SBSS uses this transaction to notify
          IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM of a change in status for a due-out asset requested by
          maintenance. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM uses the data contained in the notification to
          update the status fields in IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM systems. (See Due-Out Status
          Notification (1SH) Transaction Format, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the 1SH
          format and an explanation of the different status codes.)
          7.3.2.9.2. Management Notices. For each issue transaction submitted (whether it is
          through IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM or the SBSS input terminal), the SBSS returns an
          I004 to update the status fields in the supply data record maintained on the IMDS
          CDB/CAMS-FM system (except manual TEX ‘6’ issues or issues from a supply
348                                                        AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         point). Other management notices sent to IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM include the I005,
         I006, I023, and I122, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7). Management notices sent
         to IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM are displayed on the input terminal. IMDS CDB/CAMS-
         FM determines possible routing to other specified output terminals
         7.3.2.9.3. Reject Notices. When SBSS software detects an error in a transaction
         image sent by IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM, the image is returned to the IMDS
         CDB/CAMS-FM input terminal along with the applicable reject notice. IMDS
         CDB/CAMS-FM then determines possible routing to other output terminals. Note:
         Reject notices for IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM J activity code are not cumulative and do
         not adhere to normal materiel management procedures governing delinquency.
      7.3.2.10. Interface Failure Contingencies. Use the following procedures when one or
      more of the following interface components is inactive.
         7.3.2.10.1. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Active - ICI Active - SBSS Inactive.
            7.3.2.10.1.1. ISU Transactions. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM will reject all ISU
            transactions entered by Maintenance for transmission to the SBSS for processing.
            The transaction image input and a message will be returned to the IMDS
            CDB/CAMS-FM terminal that input the transaction. The message will indicate
            that the SBSS is unavailable for processing, and off-line processing procedures
            must be used until the SBSS again becomes active.
            7.3.2.10.1.2. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM to SBSS Transactions.                   All IMDS
            CDB/CAMS-FM to SBSS transactions, except issues, will be placed in an ICI
            hold file pending later processing. It is conceivable, though not probable, that the
            ICI file could fill to capacity. Should that occur, all subsequent IMDS
            CDB/CAMS-FM to SBSS transactions will reject back to the input IMDS
            CDB/CAMS-FM terminal with an explanation message.
         7.3.2.10.2. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Active - ICI Inactive - SBSS Active or Inactive.
         IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM will reject all transactions entered by maintenance for
         transmission to the SBSS. The transaction image and a message will be returned to
         the IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM terminal that input the transaction. The message will
         indicate that ICI is unavailable for processing and off-line processing procedures
         must be used until the electronic interface is reactivated. Contact AFMC SCM-R
         Computer Operations Activity to determine if ICI can be activated.
         7.3.2.10.3. IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Inactive - ICI Active or Inactive - SBSS Active
         or Inactive. The maintenance facility will use off-line procedures until the IMDS
         CDB/CAMS-FM becomes active and the electronic interface is reactivated.
         7.3.2.10.4. Off-line Procedures for Critically Needed Assets.
            7.3.2.10.4.1. Maintenance sends the required information to process the issue
            transaction to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. This information must
            include the ID code of the requesting IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM unit and the entire
            12-position job control number. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity creates a
            document number for the requested asset using the normal J document numbers
            and starting with a daily serial number of 8000-8999 for IMDS CDB and 9000-
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 349


            9999 for CAMS-FM.
            7.3.2.10.4.2. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity processes the issue, if the
            SBSS is active.
                7.3.2.10.4.2.1. The SBSS will either issue or kill the request. LRS/Materiel
                Management Activity then notifies Maintenance of the action taken and
                requests verification when a kill action occurs. Supply and Maintenance will
                use the information on the I023 management notice to determine how the
                request will be satisfied.
            7.3.2.10.4.3. If the SBSS is not active, supply will initiate current manual
            procedures to issue the required asset. When the SBSS is reactivated, the
            LRS/Materiel Management Activity will process the issues using degraded
            operations procedures.
  7.3.3. Reject Management.
     7.3.3.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with managing rejects
     associated with materiel management transactions. For policy specific requirements
     review AFI 23-101; for roles and responsibilities of reject management see AFH 23-123,
     Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7, and for ES-S specific guidance refer to the ES-S User’s Manual, Ch 24.
        7.3.3.1.1. ES-S Reject Management is the preferred method for managing materiel
        management rejects. ES-S provides a capability to manage all suspended rejects (not
        just those processed through ES-S). This capability is designed to replace the reject
        management processor that requires users to sign-on into the SBSS in the Demand
        mode. Rejects in ES-S may be managed for a single base or across the enterprise. See
        the ES-S user’s manual for use of ES-S Reject Management.
            7.3.3.1.1.1. Cumulative Reject Processor may be used as a secondary tool when
            ES-S is not available or until access to the ES-S Reject Management function is
            established. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7.

       AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity can load item records however, Customer
       Support will load item records when base customers are unable to process their own item
       record loads.
       8.2.1.3. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity and LRS Research and
       Records Maintenance functions are responsible for the accuracy of the transactions they
       process.
       8.2.1.4. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes for loading
       item records and for loading, changing, and deleting part number detail records.
   8.2.2. Research and Processing Actions Required to Assign Stock Numbers to Non-
   Cataloged Items.
       8.2.2.1. Purpose: Describe the procedures Research must follow to assign a stock
       number to a non-cataloged item. Also describes the requirements for completing DD
       Form 1348-6, Non-NSN requisition (manual) and actions for processing non-cataloged
       transactions.
       8.2.2.2. Non-cataloged items consist of part number items, non-NSN items, and non-
       stock listed (NSL) items.
       8.2.2.3. Verify that the source document (DD Form 1348-6, etc.) contains all necessary
       data elements to complete the research action (that is, if a TO reference is given, the
       figure and index must be included). If a TO reference gives a non-procurable source

     code, Maintenance must provide AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual Change
     Recommendation and Reply. If a sole source or brand name is specified, the customer
     must provide a letter of justification.
     8.2.2.4. If the data are insufficient, return the document to the requester.
     8.2.2.5. If there are sufficient data, proceed with specific research actions outlined in
     AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for part number items, non-NSN items, and NSL items.
  8.2.3. Indicative Data Codes.
     8.2.3.1. Purpose: Describe procedures required to manage application codes, precious
     metals indicator codes, automated data processing equipment codes and AFTO Form 95,
     Significant Historical Data codes.
     8.2.3.2. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is primarily responsible for
     processing all required actions for managing these codes, however, the LRS/Materiel
     Management Activity will process required inputs for all local stock numbered items.
     See Indicative Data Codes, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes
     on loading, changing, or deleting these codes.
     8.2.3.3. Purpose of Application Codes. Application codes relate items to specific
     systems, subsystems, end items, etc. Application codes can be used to assist in tracking
     usage and cost analysis for a given weapon system. Application codes are locally
     assigned, except as stated in this section. The major commands and AFMC SCM-R
     Records Maintenance Activity can also assign codes for use by its bases.
  8.2.4. Maintenance of Internal Records.
     8.2.4.1. Purpose: Describe actions required to maintain the internal records of the ILS-S.
     8.2.4.2. Numerous inputs are required to maintain internal records and update various
     indicative data. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes
     Records Maintenance routinely uses to update and maintain the internal records.
     8.2.4.3. Indicative data. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S
     processes to change indicative data on the item record.
     8.2.4.4. Miscellaneous data. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S
     processes to load or change miscellaneous data on the item record.
     8.2.4.5. Unit price, unit of issue, and unit pack quantity. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2,
     Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes to change unit price, unit of issue, and unit pack
     quantity on internal records.
     8.2.4.6. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity only processes price changes
     during reconciliation, at End-of-Year, and when problems arise. The LRS/Materiel
     Management Activity processes price changes for L and P numbered items and make
     corrections as necessary for stock numbered items.
     8.2.4.7. Customer Support personnel adjust the unit price of non-cataloged items (except
     local purchase) as they are received from contractors by reviewing advanced copies of
     contract and receipt documents.
352                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      8.2.4.8. Deleting item records. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S
      processes to delete item records.
  8.2.5. The Stock Number User Directory (SNUD).
      8.2.5.1. Purpose: Describe how each base, once registered as a SNUD user, will process
      AFMC output, request data or report inaccurate data, and verify (annually) its ILS-S
      database with the SNUD file. Also discussed is the Defense Inactive Item Program
      (DIIP) and how it meets its objective with the help of the item manager, Distribution, and
      Stock Control. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes.
      8.2.5.2. SNUD, D071 System, is an AFMC operated data system. SNUD distributes
      stock control data such as stock-lists to the recorded users of the stock numbers.
      8.2.5.3. SNUD provides automatic distribution of stock number management data to
      bases that are recorded users of the stock number. Distribution based on established user
      interest reduces the need for users to manually research reference documents such as
      stock-lists, stock-list change notices, General Services Administration (GSA) catalogs,
      etc.
  8.2.6. Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG) Data.
      8.2.6.1. Purpose: Describe actions required to maintain the ISG records in the ILS-S.
      The ISG provides bases with information about items that may be used interchangeably
      for local use. By using this information, each base may select suitable substitute items
      from a wide range of relationships and adapt these items for local use. Maximum use of
      these interchangeable and suitable substitutes will reduce waste throughout the AF.
      8.2.6.2. ISGs consist of items that are similar physically and functionally. In other
      words, ISG items may be substituted for one another and used to do comparable work.
      After performing these similar tasks, ISG items must consistently provide the same
      quality of performance. Each group is also designed to contain items that have
      management data compatibility.
      8.2.6.3. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes for managing
      ISG data. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity manages ISG actions.
  8.2.7. Assignment and Management of Freeze Codes.
      8.2.7.1. Purpose: Describe procedures for the management and assignment of freeze
      codes, as well as the management of associated output notices and rejects.
      8.2.7.2. Organizational freeze codes freeze the Organization Cost Center Record
      (OCCR). Freeze code R will be loaded on the OCCR when two conditions are present:
      1) when the organization is being deactivated, consolidated, or transferred; and 2) when
      an external decision has been made to restrict some financial transactions against the
      organization, while allowing the processing of returns and reverse-post transactions to
      clear detail records. Freeze code D will be loaded when no further transactions are to be
      processed.
         8.2.7.2.1. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity and LRS/Materiel
         Management Activity personnel assign freeze codes to item records in order to
         identify the reason for freezing the item record and the responsible activity. See
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  353


        Freeze Code Load or Delete (FFC), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable
        ILS-S processes on loading and deleting freeze codes.
        8.2.7.2.2. Customer Support will monitor the use of these codes. Note: Materiel
        Management personnel at a satellite can assign freeze codes only to records of that
        satellite system designator.
     8.2.7.3. Assignment of Freeze Codes.
        8.2.7.3.1. Only one freeze code may be assigned to an item record. When an item
        record is already frozen, the appropriate material management IT system will reject a
        second code assignment.
        8.2.7.3.2. The activity responsible for assigning the freeze codes will maintain a
        suspense file for each frozen item record.
        8.2.7.3.3. Freeze Code Usage and responsibility:
            8.2.7.3.3.1. Code A. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity or Customer
            Support is Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for freeze code A and
            maintains the suspense notice file. Use this code when no other freeze code
            applies. Freeze code A is assigned when a Freeze Code Load is processed (see
            AFMAN 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8).
            8.2.7.3.3.2. Code C and I. Freeze code C and I designates items under inventory.
            Physical Inventory Control Section is responsible for the use and control of these
            freeze codes and maintains the suspense notice file.
               8.2.7.3.3.2.1. Freeze code C identifies items under a complete (typically
               scheduled) inventory. Freeze Code C is automatically assigned as the result of
               Inventory Recount File processing (See Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and
               Inventory Adjustments of this manual for additional information on
               assigning freeze code C).
               8.2.7.3.3.2.2. Forward all rejects resulting from the existence of freeze code C
               to Physical Inventory Control for action.
               8.2.7.3.3.2.3. Rejects for Freeze Codes I and C. Physical Inventory Control
               personnel will maintain a reject notices in a suspense file in stock number
               sequence. If it is necessary for adequate control, Inventory Count personnel
               may retain separate suspense files by freeze code.
                 8.2.7.3.3.2.3.1. Rejected Inputs. File inputs that are rejected because the
                 item record is frozen (freeze codes C and I) with the inventory suspense
                 notice.
                 8.2.7.3.3.2.3.2. Releasing Frozen Records. Physical Inventory Control
                 personnel are responsible for properly releasing frozen records for freeze
                 codes C and I.
                 8.2.7.3.3.2.3.3. Removing Rejected Documents. When the freeze code has
                 been deleted, Physical Inventory Control personnel will remove rejected
                 documents from the suspense file and immediately notify the appropriate
                 office that the freeze code has been lifted from the item record. The rejected
 354                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


                    document can then be re-input.
              8.2.7.3.3.3. Code E. Equipment Management assigns this code and is also
              responsible for maintaining the suspense notices file.
              8.2.7.3.3.4. Code I. Inventory and the Central Storage Element, assign this code
              for special inventory. Inline programs also assign this code when insufficient
              balances require a special inventory or when a corrected input is required. Note:
              A Freeze Code Load/Delete input cannot load or delete this freeze code.
              Inventory is responsible for maintaining the suspense notices file (see
              8.2.7.3.3.2.3. for additional information on managing suspense files for Code I).
              8.2.7.3.3.5. Code L. AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity or LRS
              Functional Systems Management activity assigns this code when either a database
              key or set error is detected. The activity responsible for assigning the freeze code
              will maintain a suspense file.
              8.2.7.3.3.6. Code N. The NTCC assigns this code on all NWRM by processing a
              NWRM Freeze Code Load or Delete. Note: Coordinate with NTCC to complete
              NWRM Equipment related transactions processed thru AFEMS.
              8.2.7.3.3.7. Code P. Program Control loads and deletes this code. It cannot be
              loaded or deleted with Freeze Code or Delete inputs.
                  8.2.7.3.3.7.1. Program Control assigns this code when a unit of price change
                  is processed for an item with an IEX 3 or 6. Programs delete this code when a
                  Bulk Issue Reconciliation input is processed with a D in position 52.
                  8.2.7.3.3.7.2. Program Control also assign a P freeze code to the item record
                  for budget code 8 items which are locally assigned. Process a Price List
                  Change Input to remove freeze code P.
8.2.7.3.3.8. Code Q. This code is assigned to items requiring reverse-post action. Document
Control is responsible for maintaining the suspense notice file.
              8.2.7.3.3.9. Code R. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activities and
              Customer Support Sections use this code to freeze item records that may require
              correction or deletion of indicative data and extended research or checking is
              required. The activity responsible for assigning the freeze code will maintain a
              suspense file.
              8.2.7.3.3.10. Code S. The AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity assigns this
              code and is responsible for maintaining the suspense notices file.
       8.2.7.4. Management of Notices. The activity responsible for assigning the freeze code
       will maintain one copy of each load output suspense notice or frozen record notice in a
       suspense file in stock number sequence. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for
       applicable ILS-S processes for management notices and rejects.
           8.2.7.4.1. Inputs rejected because the item record is frozen (except freeze codes C
           and I) will be placed behind the load output suspense notice/frozen record notice in
           the suspense file.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  355


        8.2.7.4.2. The activity assigned the freeze code is responsible for prompt clearance of
        freeze codes. If item records are frozen more than three working days, a justified
        reason for the delay must be written on the suspense notice.
        8.2.7.4.3. Freeze codes will be monitored daily using a locally designed query. The
        activity assigned the freeze code in Para 8.2.7.3 is responsible for the prompt
        clearance of their respective freeze codes. Item records frozen for more than three
        working days require a justified reason for the delay and must be annotated on the
        locally designed query.
        8.2.7.4.4. When an output suspense delete notice is received, the matching suspense
        load notice/frozen record notice and any rejected documents will be removed from
        the suspense file and reinput. The area responsible for assigning the freeze code to
        complete processing for suspended transactions.
  8.2.8. Management of Controlled Item Codes (CIC).
     8.2.8.1. Purpose: Describe procedures required to manage controlled item codes.
     8.2.8.2. Controlled items require different kinds of handling for security purposes. The
     controlled item code is a one-position alpha/numeric code used to indicate the degree of
     security handling needed for a given item. See DoD 4100.39-M for a complete list and
     Controlled Inventory Item Code definitions.
     8.2.8.3. Research assigns the controlled item code when the item record is first loaded.
     Records Maintenance or Inspection is responsible for all subsequent actions. It is the
     responsibility of Records Maintenance to ensure that all controlled item phrase codes are
     loaded.
     8.2.8.4. When you suspect that a coding is incorrect, you should assign the code
     requiring a higher degree of security handling. If the item is included in SNUD, you can
     submit an inquiry to SNUD. SNUD will submit current stock control data via SNUD
     input. If you are still unsure of the coding, the personnel responsible for cataloging the
     item should be contacted. SNUD inquiries are always submitted under the FB account of
     the computer support base.
     8.2.8.5. Local managers, at their discretion, can upgrade items coded through SNUD as
     unclassified, nonsensitive, or nonpilferable to pilferable status. Such items will be
     assigned controlled item code asterisk (*). An (*) can be assigned only to item records
     having an existing code of U and will not be changed through SNUD interface. See
     Controlled Item Code Change and Upgrade, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for
     applicable materiel mgt. system processes on changing and upgrading the CIC, as well as
     system output and rejects.
  8.2.9. Transportation Data.
     8.2.9.1. Purpose: Describe procedures required to manage Special Packing Instructions
     (SPI) data.
     8.2.9.2. SPI and the foam-in-place code are provided to help the LRS/Transportation
     activity personnel prepare items for movement. Although in general, these numbers and
     codes apply to recoverable items, they may be assigned to some expendable items. The
     information represented by these codes is stored on the item record and will be printed on
356                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      all DD Form 1348-1A shipping, issue, and due-out release documents. In addition, the
      phrase REUSABLE CONTAINER will be printed on all DD Form 1348-1A shipping,
      issue, and due-out release documents when an SPI applies. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2,
      Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes on loading, changing, and deleting of transportation
      data.
      8.2.9.3. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity loads and maintains
      transportation data.
  8.2.10. Standard Reporting Designator (SRD).
      8.2.10.1. Purpose: Describe procedures required to manage SRDs.
      8.2.10.2. The SRD record is a computer-generated record that identifies the aircraft, end
      items, or systems assigned to the base and/or satellite accounts. This record consolidates
      the elements of mission design series (MDS) and maintenance equipment classification
      designator (MECD).
      8.2.10.3. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity researches and prepares inputs
      to load, change and delete SRDs and performs annual SRD validations. The
      LRS/Materiel Management Activity will load SRD records if required for establishment
      of MICAP due-out details. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S
      processes on loading, changing, or deleting SRDs.
  8.2.11. Federal Supply Class (FSC) and Materiel Management Aggregation Codes
  (MMAC).
      8.2.11.1. Purpose: Describe procedures required to manage FSC and MMAC records.
      8.2.11.2. These records are used to route reports and shipments to the correct item
      manager (IM).
      8.2.11.3. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for maintaining,
      monitoring, researching and preparing inputs to load, change, or delete FSC and MMAC
      records. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes on loading,
      changing, or deleting FSCs and MMACs.
  8.2.12. Shipping Destination Records.
      8.2.12.1. Purpose: Describe procedures for maintaining Shipping Destination Records.
      8.2.12.2. The shipping program uses shipping destination records to print addresses for
      shipments on DD Form 1348-1A. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-
      S processes on the maintenance of these records, including shell records, and procedures
      for changing and deleting shipping destination records. The AFMC SCM-R Records
      Maintenance Activity loads and maintains shipping destination records.
      8.2.12.3. When unserviceable ERRCD XD2 items are shipped to destinations other than
      the FSC or FSC/MMAC unserviceable storage site, a shipping destination record is
      maintained for each destination. AFMC uses SNUD to selectively disseminate data for
      controlling the movement of reparable items.
      8.2.12.4. Shipments Requiring Shipping Destination Records. Records Maintenance will
      load and maintain a shipping destination record for each shipment to any of the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  357


     following: AFMC IM, AFMC unserviceable storage site, DLA storage sites, General
     Services Administration (GSA), and Army storage points. Shipping destination records
     may also be established when redistribution orders and lateral support requests give rise
     to frequent shipments (serviceable and unserviceable) to any authorized stock record
     account number.
     8.2.12.5. Ship-to Account Field of the shipping destination record. When the input ship-
     to account code is EZ or EY in the first two positions, the system will allow loading of a
     RIC on the shipping destination record.
     8.2.12.6. References. Shipping addresses, routing identifier codes, and ZIP codes are
     found in the following references:
        8.2.12.6.1. Shipping address information and routing identifier codes are listed in
        DoD 4000.25-1, MILSTRIP Routing Identifier and Distribution Codes.
        8.2.12.6.2. ZIP codes are listed in the postal ZIP code manual.
  8.2.13. Organization Cost Center Records (OCCR).
     8.2.13.1. Purpose: Describe the purpose of and procedures for maintaining OCCRs.
     8.2.13.2. The organization code identifies organizations and detachments receiving
     logistical support from the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. The organization code
     also identifies the internal functions of the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. Many
     financial and ILS-S internal program decisions are made based on organization codes.
     8.2.13.3. LRS/Materiel Management Activities are responsible for loading, changing,
     and deleting OCCRs for all on-base organizations, satellite accounts and geographically
     separated units. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for
     loading, changing and deleting OCCRs for deployed units at contingency sites. See AFH
     23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes on the actions required to
     establish, change, or delete OCCRs.
  8.2.14. Exception Phrase Records and Type Cargo Phrase Records.
     8.2.14.1. Purpose: Describe the purpose of and procedures for maintaining exception
     phrase and type cargo phrase records.
     8.2.14.2. These are records that use narrative phrases rather than alpha-numeric code that

            above.
     9.2.1.7. The following actions will be performed by the receiving sites when controlling
     and accounting for empty RESUPPLY BARGE gas cylinders FSC 8120:
        9.2.1.7.1. Will ensure all site remote locations store and maintain accountability prior
        to shipment to local vendor for refill or DLADS for disposal actions. The AF no
        longer has a dedicated barge to handle retrograde. Only those cylinders, which do not
        have stocks available at the host supply account, will be shipped via air to local
        vendors for subsequent refill actions.
        9.2.1.7.2. Will report to the RESUPPLY BARGE manager any empty cylinders
        requiring disposal. The RESUPPLY BARGE manager will then direct appropriate
        disposal actions. At no time will empty cylinders be shipped to JBER without prior
        approval. This will ensure disposal can be completed expeditiously and that stocks
        are not maintained in the host supply account.
        9.2.1.7.3. Will ensure that prior to shipment via barge or air and surface, cylinders
        are properly palletized in accordance with AFMAN 23-210, Joint Service Manual
        (JSM) for Storage and Materials. Shipping documentation must also clearly indicate
        that empty cylinders are required for RESUPPLY BARGE and the year required.
        9.2.1.7.4. The 673 LRS Asset Management Section is no longer responsible for
        storing empty RESUPPLY BARGE cylinders. Individual remote locations will store
        and requisition those cylinders that are required to meet the upcoming re-supply
        efforts. Cylinders required to fulfill annual RESUPPLY BARGE requirements, that
        missed barge sailing dates, must be shipped via air to JBER marked for subsequent
        consolidated shipment, as directed by 611th ASUS/LR.
        9.2.1.7.5. The following information will be identified by remote locations when
        identifying RESUPPLY BARGE cylinder requirements:
            9.2.1.7.5.1. NSN of the cylinder, type and capacity of cylinder (EXAMPLES:
            Acetylene 225CF, CO2 50 Pounds).
            9.2.1.7.5.2. Quantity on hand, and total number of cylinders by size and type,
            needed to fill current year RESUPPLY BARGE requirements.
        9.2.1.7.6. Gas cylinders shipped via barge or air and surface will be clearly marked
        for remote operating locations. Each remote location must maintain a separate AF
        Form 2009-1, Manual Supply Accounting Record, on each type (NSN) cylinder
        maintained in stock. The contractor must report those cylinders that are excess to site
        operational requirements to the SOS, as required, and request disposition instructions.
        No cylinders will be shipped to the host supply account at JBER for disposal or as
        serviceable excess. Those cylinders that are authorized for disposal must be properly
        prepared for shipment via barge/air and an AF Form 332 prepared by the using
        contractor prior to shipment to the host base for disposal action by the local disposal
        activity. The responsible contractor at remote locations must ensure demilitarization
        is scheduled to be accomplished, ensuring expeditious transfer to DLADS facilities.

      9.2.1.8. Any excess and scrap materiel identified for retrograde by RESUPPLY BARGE
      must be reported to the RESUPPLY BARGE manager no later than 1 March each year.
      This early reporting is necessary in order to pre-plan barge loads to accommodate
      retrograde from all sites and LRSs. A final retrograde report must be submitted to the
      611th ASUS/LR/LRT RESUPPLY BARGE manager by 1 May. Reports must include the
      stock number, unit of issue, nomenclature, quantity, approximate weight and cube of each
      item, and one copy of the return/shipping document.
      9.2.1.9. Hazardous Material/Waste must be processed to the designated Hazardous
      Storage Facility at DLADS, JBER, AK.
      9.2.1.10. Once the Hazardous Material/Waste is processed, forward two advance copies
      of the DD Form 1348-1 (shipping document) to RESUPPLY BARGE manager.
      9.2.1.11. The following actions will be performed when retrograding condemned
      accountable equipment items (EAID) and non-hazardous scrap material.
         9.2.1.11.1. Site personnel must obtain disposition instructions from 673 Customer
         Support Element prior to shipment of EAID and non-hazardous scrap material.
         9.2.1.11.2. Coordinate all EAID assets through the 673 EAE and Vehicle
         Management as applicable to ensure all equipment return actions are captured.
         Prepare manual shipping document (DD Form 1348-1A) for retrograde of all
         condemned Non-EAID (NF1 or XB3) budget code 9 assets and non-hazardous scrap
         material destined for DLADS activity IAW Para 6.2.1
         9.2.1.11.3. King Salmon and Eareckson will prepare and forward documents
         terminating supply/equipment accountability (AF Form 601/DD Form 1348-1A) to
         673 EAE . See Para 5.4.5.3 for specific procedures on preparing these documents.
         All sites will provide the signed copy two of the shipping document to RESUPPLY
         BARGE manager.
      9.2.1.12. Normally, serviceable materials (excess supplies) will be used in-theater and
      not retrograded to the Seattle SDDC. Site personnel will report serviceable excesses to
      673 LRS Customer Support Element for disposition instructions.
  9.2.2. Donation Procedures to the USAF Heritage Program.

                  INTENSIVELY MANAGED AND TRACKED ITEMS

Section 10A—Overview

10.1. Overview. This chapter outlines procedures affecting AF intensively managed and
tracked items. These include management of controlled material to include NWRM and other
controlled or sensitive items. As listed in Attachment 1A, various DOD and AF publications are
reference sources for this publication. For this chapter, DOD 4140.1-R, and AFI 20-110 are the
primary DOD and AF references.

Section 10B—Management of Controlled Materiel

10.2. Management of Controlled Materiel.
   10.2.1. Serialized Control and Reporting Small Arms/Light Weapons (SA/LW).
       10.2.1.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with the management of
       SA/LW. This section specifically covers procedures for serialized coding, reporting and
       reconciliation, serial number detail information and serial number control processing. For
       policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101, Sec. 10B, Management of Controlled
       Materiel and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 or the ES-S
       User’s Manual.
       10.2.1.2. Caution: Do not process controlled material as found on base. See Sec. 6B,
       Returns of this manual for exceptions to FOB processing.
       10.2.1.3. General Procedure for SA/LW.
          10.2.1.3.1. When SA/LWs are received or shipped, unpack the SA/LWs to positively
          identify the serial number on the bare equipment.
          10.2.1.3.2. Coordinate off-base shipments through transportation channels prior to
          processing. Shipping arrangements will be obtained from Deployment and
          Distribution.
          10.2.1.3.3. All source documents for SA/LW will be processed and sent to Document
          Control within 3 workdays from the ILS-S processed date or the date processed in
          degraded operations.
              10.2.1.3.3.1. The serial numbers for each transaction will be listed on the
              management notice in conjunction with the output (source) document.
              10.2.1.3.3.2. Document Control will file a copy of the management notice along
              with the source document.
              10.2.1.3.3.3. Degraded Operations and hand scribed documents will be held for
              processing until the ILS-S becomes available and recovery transactions are
              processed. Make sure the correct serial numbers are transcribed on the documents.
          10.2.1.3.4. SA/LW requiring serialized control and reporting are identified on the
          item record by a serialized report code (SRC) of A. The SRC is assigned by, the
368                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         AFMC SA/LW Serialized Control Activity and is pushed to bases by the Stock
         Number User Directory (SNUD) using Stock List Change transactions. Controlled
         item codes (CIC) N, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8 are also assigned to these items. Serialized
         reporting does not apply to barrels, firing mechanisms, etc. However, these items are
         assigned a CIC N to indicate they require special control/warehousing to prevent
         pilferage. Only items with a SRC A are reported to the AFEMS system.
         10.2.1.3.5. If a transaction at base level increases or decreases the base asset position,
         a daily change report is generated under program control If the transaction pertains to
         a type account E, ERRCD NF2/ND2 item, the daily change report is forwarded to
         AFEMS (C001) via Daily Equipment Transaction Report files. Note: IEX B is not
         required for items assigned SRC A.
         10.2.1.3.6. The actual serial numbers for each item coded with SRC A are
         maintained on either a 249 serialized control detail or a 250 in-use serialized control
         detail. A Weapons Serialized Control input is used to load, change or delete these
         details. (See Weapons Serialized Control Input (DSR), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch
         10 for transaction format) Up to ten (10) eleven digit serial numbers may be input
         with one Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two transaction. Serial numbers
         for items in serviceable stock or on an unserviceable detail, regardless of ERRCD, are
         maintained on a 249 serialized control detail. Upon issue these details will convert to
         a 250 in-use serialized control detail. Example: There are 100 weapons in
         serviceable stock, with 100 serialized control (249) details loaded. SrA Smith has a
         requirement for 50 of these weapons, and her equipment account is authorized 50 of
         these weapons. After loading the authorized in-use detail, EAE will process a
         Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with type phrase ISU/DOR and the
         program prepares those 50 details selected for issue to SrA Smith’s equipment
         account. When the issue request is processed, those 50 serialized control (249)
         details selected will be deleted, and program control will create 50 in-use serialized
         control (250) details with the authorized in-use detail document number. The
         remaining 249 serialized control details stay on the item record, and the serviceable
         balance will reflect 50 EA. The same theory applies to items issued to other types of
         details, i.e., RSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM and supply point from serviceable stock.
         10.2.1.3.7. The LRS CC/AO will not track type account B SRC A assets (i.e., aircraft
         weapons coded as XD, XF, XB) once they are issued to the using organization.
         10.2.1.3.8. Serial Number Entry. Enter all serial numbers left justified. The SA/LW
         serial number must not be prefixed by zeros unless the zero is part of the serial
         number. Examples: If the serial number is 123, it will be entered as ‘123’. If the
         serial number is 0123, it will be entered as ‘0123.’
      10.2.1.4. SA/LW Reidentification. When it is necessary to reidentify SA/LWs (for
      example, M-16 modification), use the Weapon Modification program (see Weapon (M-
      16) Modification (NGV441), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6). Both stock numbers must
      have a serialized report code of "A" assigned. The Federal Supply Class (FSC) of both
      stock numbers must be 1005, 1010, 1015, or 1095. If any one item under a selected
      detail is deployed, that detail will not be modified and a statement will be printed on the
      output listing notifying requester there is external review required for that detail. If the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   369


     total numbers of 250 in-use serialized control details do not equal the on-hand quantity of
     the authorized in-use detail, the program will only modify the number of existing 250 in-
     use serialized control details, not to exceed the authorized quantity. The program will
     print a statement on the output listing notifying the requester of the total number of
     details modified, number of details not modified, and if external review is required. A
     Small Arms Multi-field Correction report is produced and forwarded via SIFS to AFEMS
     (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for additional information on this report).
     10.2.1.5. Serialized Report Code (SRC) Changes.
        10.2.1.5.1. Verification. When the SRC changes from an “A” to blank or from blank
        to an “A,” an F118 Management Notice is generated by program control. The F118
        will print the Catalog Management Data Change Record input image with a clear text
        statement indicating the change “to” and “from” SRC. Customer Support must verify
        the change with the AFMC SA/LW Serialized Control Activity.
        10.2.1.5.2. Procedures for Valid Changes. If the SRC change is valid, process a
        Serialized Control Input-Format Two to add or delete the applicable 249 serialized
        control/250 in-use serialized control detail(s). See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10
        for transaction formats. Note: SRC cannot be deleted if serialized control/in use
        serialized control details are loaded.
        10.2.1.5.3. Procedures for Invalid Changes. For invalid changes, reprocess the
        Catalog Management Data Change Record to input the correct SRC.
     10.2.1.6. Weapon Reconciliation.
        10.2.1.6.1. Reconciliation Actions. Prior to 30 April process the edit option of the
        Weapon Reconciliation Report with a (-) dash in position 64. This option compares
        the on-hand balance and detail balance to 249 serialized control/250 in-use serialized
        control detail records.
            10.2.1.6.1.1. An error listing is produced for records that do not pass edits. Take
            action to correct errors and out-of-balance conditions.
            10.2.1.6.1.2. When all reporting errors are corrected and all out-of-balance
            conditions have been resolved, process the Weapon Reconciliation Report with
            ‘W’ in position 66 of the program select card to create the outbound SIFS files.
            The SIFS files are automatically transmitted to the appropriate receiving system.
            External review is not necessary. Note: Do not process the SIFS option earlier
            than 30 April unless directed by the AFMC SA/LW Serialized Control Activity or
            the applicable Major Command.
        10.2.1.6.2. Overages and shortages identified during reconciliation with the AFMC
        SA/LW Serialized Control Activity must be thoroughly researched, inventoried,
        and/or appropriate investigative actions initiated.
        10.2.1.6.3. Invalid Reconciliation Reject Notice. The LRS CC/AO will not maintain
        visibility of type account B (ERRCD XD, XF, XB) weapons once they are issued to
        the using organization so they will not be included in the annual reconciliation. It is
        the responsibility of the LRS/Materiel Management Activity SA/LW POC to
370                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         research these notices, and ensure these items have in fact been issued to a using
         organization. No response is required for these reject notices.
      10.2.1.7. Error Notices. When an error is detected by the AFEMS system, a Small Arms
      Reject/Follow-up with an error notification code in positions 23-24 is transmitted to the
      reporting SRAN. (Error notification codes are defined in COMSEC Error Notification
      Codes, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10.). When the Small Arms Reject/Follow-up is
      processed, an F122 Management Notice is generated under program control.
         10.2.1.7.1. Research. Bases will research the error notice and take action to correct
         the discrepancy.
         10.2.1.7.2. Serial numbers for type account B assets are not stored on serialized
         control records after issue, so any inquiries/error notifications must be verified with
         the owning organization. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity SA/LW POC
         must research the transaction history to determine what organization was issued the
         asset and contact the organization to verify if they have the serial number.
         10.2.1.7.3. After thorough research is completed, process a Small Arms Correction
         Report (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for format and entry requirements).
         Transmission to AFEMS will be the same as used for daily change reports.
      10.2.1.8. Serial Number Modifications.
         10.2.1.8.1. Forced Record Alteration program is no longer required to change a
         serialized control serial number.
         10.2.1.8.2. Only Chief Inspectors are authorized to process a Serialized Control Input
         (XS1) transaction for NWRM and must notify the NTCC of serial number changes
         before processing.
         10.2.1.8.3. Use a Serialized Control Input (XS1) to load serialized control details that
         have been erroneously deleted, to delete serialized control details that were
         incorrectly loaded, or to change the serial number on serialized control detail. See
         Serialized Control Input (XS1), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for format and entry
         requirements.
      10.2.1.9. SA/LW Serial Number Transaction Processing.
         10.2.1.9.1. When processing transactions that affect the total on-hand or detail
         quantity, normal processing procedures apply. However, when processing a
         transaction for a partial quantity, you must identify affected serial numbers before
         you process the transaction.
             10.2.1.9.1.1. An F117 Management Notice listing the serial number(s) will be
             printed in conjunction with output documents created as a result of completed
             transactions.
             10.2.1.9.1.2. All SRC A items must have a 249 serialized control detail or 250 in-
             use serialized control loaded or the transactions will reject.
             10.2.1.9.1.3. Because of the likelihood of receiving an error condition, limit the
             quantity to 80 on related transactions (issues, receipts, etc.) involving serialized
             control details. If more than 80 serial numbers are involved, break up the
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    371


          transaction for multiple inputs.
       10.2.1.9.2. Issues.
          10.2.1.9.2.1. Issue of total on-hand quantity to a detail. If the total on-hand
          quantity is being issued to a detail (i.e. RSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM, supply point)
          normal issue procedures apply; and Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format
          Two processing is not necessary. The applicable 249 serialized control detail will
          be deleted and a 250 in-use serialized control will be established by program
          control. The newly created 250 in-use serialized control will reflect the same
          document number as the ‘parent’ detail. Note: The number of serialized control
          details must equal the item record serviceable balance to process a total on-hand
          balance.
          10.2.1.9.2.2. Issue of partial on-hand quantity to a detail. If less than the total on-
          hand quantity is being issued to a detail, you must identify which serial number(s)
          to issue. Process a Weapons Serialized Control-Format Two input with type
          phrase ‘ISU/DOR.’ This will load an ‘I’ in the RECEIPT-CODE field of the 249
          serialized control detail to prepare the detail for subsequent issue or due-out
          release. Upon completion of issue processing, the applicable 249 serialized
          control detail(s) will be deleted and a 250 in-use serialized control detail(s) will
          be created. The newly created 250 in-use serialized control will reflect the same
          document number as the ‘parent’ detail. Note: Prior to processing transactions
          from serialized control details, it may be necessary to coordinate with warehouse
          personnel to determine which serial numbers to identify.
          10.2.1.9.2.3. Issues to an organization. Serial number accountability for type
          account B items (ERRCD XD/XF/XB) becomes the responsibility of the using
          organization at the time of issue.
          10.2.1.9.2.4. Issue of total quantity from a detail. If the total detail quantity is
          being issued, normal issue procedures apply. All 250 in-use serialized control
          details identified will be deleted.
          10.2.1.9.2.5. Issue of partial quantity from a detail. If less than the total detail
          quantity is being issued you must identify the serial number(s) to issue. Process a
          Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with “MSI” in the first three
          positions of the type phrase field to load an “M” to the in-use serialized control
          detail. After the record(s) is/are flagged, normal MSI procedures apply. The 250
          in-use serialized control details identified will be deleted. New 250 In-use
          serialized control details will be established for type account E items under the
          organization and shop of the using organization, not to exceed the authorized
          quantity.
              10.2.1.9.2.5.1. When items are issued from a detail, the issue programs will
              try to replenish the detail unless an “F” is in position 54 of the issue request
              input. If the on-hand balance is greater than the replenishment quantity the
              replenishment transaction will reject unless the applicable 249 serialized
              control detail is identified for issue. To avoid rejects, it’s recommended all
              issues for serialized control items from a detail are processed with an F in
372                                                      AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             position 54 of the issue request input. If replenishment is desired after the
             transaction is processed, refer to issue processing in Para 10.2.1.9.2 above.
             10.2.1.9.2.5.2. You cannot process an issue from one detail to another. A
             return from the “issuing” detail must be processed to the item record then
             another issue processed to the gaining detail.
      10.2.1.9.3. Returns.
         10.2.1.9.3.1. Return of total detail quantity. If the total detail quantity is being
         returned, normal return procedures apply. The in-use serialized control detail
         (250 record) will be deleted and a 249 serialized control detail established under
         program control.
         10.2.1.9.3.2. Return of partial quantity from a detail. If less than the total detail
         quantity is being returned you must identify the serial numbers for return. Process
         a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with the phrase “TURN-IN” to
         load a “T” to the 250 in-use serialized control detail. After the records are
         flagged, normal return procedures apply. The flagged in-use serialized control
         details will be deleted and 249 serialized control details established.
         10.2.1.9.3.3. Return of items not on a detail. Process a Weapons Serialized
         Control Input-Format Two with “TURN-IN” to load a serialized control detail
         (249 record). After the serialized control detail is established, normal return
         procedures apply.
      10.2.1.9.4. Shipments. Shipments from details are not allowed. Items on in-use
      serialized control details must be returned to stock before shipment processing. Note:
      Transfer is authorized for RSP, MSK, SPRAM, Authorized In-Use and WRM details
      (see Para 10.2.1.9.8 below for transfer procedures).
         10.2.1.9.4.1. For shipments of entire on-hand warehouse balance, normal
         shipment procedures apply.
         10.2.1.9.4.2. Shipment of partial on-hand quantity. If less than the total detail
         quantity is being shipped you must identify the serial number(s) to ship. Process
         a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with the type phrase ‘ISU/DOR’
         to prepare the serialized control detail for shipment. Note: Redistribution
         Orders/Referrals from MSK and Supply Point Details may be processed. Warner
         Robins (WR-ALC) is no longer the storage site for weapons. Weapons are stored
         at the Anniston Army Depot, AL. Weapons being returned to Depot must be
         shipped to the Anniston Army Depot ( FY1346).
      10.2.1.9.5. Receipts. When weapons are shipped from the depot, the AFEMS system
      forwards a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with an asterisk in position
      7 and type phrase ‘SHIPPED’ to the receiving base to identify which stock number,
      document number and serial numbers are being shipped. The Weapons Serialized
      Control Input-Format Two will be sent through SIFS and processed through pseudo,
      and a serialized control detail will be loaded for each serial numbered item being
      shipped. When the items are received, the serialized control detail should be ready
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    373


       for receipt processing. After successful receipt processing an F117 Management
       Notice is output reflecting all serial numbers processed.
          10.2.1.9.5.1. If a 615 reject is received, the serialized control detail is not loaded.
          If weapons are received and there is not a serialized control detail loaded, process
          Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with type phrase ‘SHIPPED’ to
          load a the detail. Refer to Weapons Serialized Control Input (DSR) - Format
          Two, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for transaction format and type phrase
          codes that will change the receipt codes. If the Due In is not loaded, process a
          Prepositioned Materiel Receipt to load the due in (see Prepositioned Materiel
          Receipts - Input/Output (99S) AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for instructions and
          format).
          10.2.1.9.5.2. If a 616 reject is received, there is either not enough or too many
          serialized control details loaded for the input document number.
          10.2.1.9.5.3. If a 619 reject is received, the Item Record does not have a SRC.
          10.2.1.9.5.4. If a 620 reject is received, the serialized control detail serial number
          you are trying to load is already loaded. Process a stock number inquiry, with
          type record retrieval code ‘Z’ and ‘249’ for the selected detail document number.
          This will show you all the serialized control details loaded for this stock number.
          10.2.1.9.5.5. Receiving must inspect and verify serial numbers when small arms
          are received. Errors between serial numbers shipped and received must be
          identified to the AFMC SA/LW Serialized Control Activity. LRS/Materiel
          Management Activity SA/LW POC will notify AFMC SA/LW Serialized Control
          Activity by priority message or email with an information copy to the shipper and
          MAJCOM of both shipping and receiving activities. The receipt reporting should
          be delayed until resolution by the AFMC SA/LW Serialized Control Activity.
       10.2.1.9.6. Record reversal and correction transactions. Prior to these transactions
       process a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two to create/delete the
       applicable serialized control detail/in-use serialized control detail. Ensure the correct
       type phrase is used (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for additional information on
       type phrase).
       10.2.1.9.7. Deployment Procedures.
          10.2.1.9.7.1. Deployment Of Total Detail Quantity. If you deploy the total on-
          hand quantity of the detail (RSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM or authorized in-use)
          normal deployment processing procedures apply. The deployed routing identifier
          will be stored on the applicable in-use serialized control detail records.
          10.2.1.9.7.2. Deployment Of Less Than Total Detail Quantity. If you deploy less
          than the total on-hand detail quantity process a Weapons Serialized Control Input-
          Format Two with type phrase “DEPLOY” to load a “D” in the ACTION-CODE
          field of the in-use serialized control detail record. After the records are flagged,
          normal deployment processing procedures apply. Program control deletes the
          “D” from the ACTION CODE field of the in-use serialized control detail and
          loads the deployed routing identifier to the DEPLOYED-RID field of the in-use
374                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


             serialized control detail
             10.2.1.9.7.3. Total Quantity Returned From Deployment. If you return the total
             deployed quantity, normal return deployment processing procedures apply. The
             deployed routing identifier will be deleted from the applicable in-use serialized
             control detail (250 record).
             10.2.1.9.7.4. Partial Quantity Returned From Deployment. If you return less than
             the total quantity deployed process a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format
             Two with type phrase “RETURN” to load an “R” in the ACTION-CODE field of
             the in-use serialized control detail. After the records are flagged, normal return
             deployment processing procedures apply. 10.2.1.9.8. Transfer Procedures.
             10.2.1.9.8.1. Transfer of Total Detail Quantity. If you transfer the total on-hand
             quantity of the detail (RSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM, or authorized in-use) normal
             transfer processing procedures apply. Daily Change Reports are generated under
             program control to update AFEMS (C001) . In addition, Weapons Serialized
             Control Input images are created for forwarding to the gaining base to establish
             serialized control details.
             10.2.1.9.8.2. Transfer of Less Than Total Detail Quantity. If you transfer less
             than the total on-hand detail quantity process a Weapons Serialized Control Input-
             Format Two with type phrase “TRANFER” (Note the spelling of this phrase) to
             load a “T” in the ACTION-CODE field. After the records are flagged, normal
             transfer processing procedures apply. Daily Change Reports are generated under
             program control to update AFEMS (C001). In addition, Weapons Serialized
             Control Input images are created for forwarding to the gaining base to establish
             serialized control detail.
  10.2.2. Serialized Control and Reporting of COMSEC/CCI Items.
      10.2.2.1. Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with the management of
      controlled materiel. This section specifically covers the serialized control and reporting
      procedures for COMSEC items.
      10.2.2.2. Caution: Observe the following cautions when handling COMSEC/CCI.
         10.2.2.2.1. Do not process COMSEC/CCI assets as found on base. If the COMSEC
         asset was received from the National Security Agency or its suppliers, or has a
         documented history of accountability, e.g. SF 153, then utilize equipment receipt.
         Otherwise, contact the appropriate Item Manager to determine ownership and/or
         proper disposition.
         10.2.2.2.2. Foreign nationals are authorized to store, inspect, deliver, and handle
         controlled cryptographic item (CCI) assets as long as there is a U.S. citizen present.
      10.2.2.3. General Procedure for COMSEC
         10.2.2.3.1. AFMC Cryptological System Activity monitors the central file of all
         COMSEC assets by serial number via AFEMS.
         10.2.2.3.2. Coordinate off-base shipment through transportation channels prior to
         processing. Shipping arrangements should be obtained from LRS Cargo Movement.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     375


        10.2.2.3.3. All source documents for COMSEC items will be processed and sent to
        Document Control within 3 workdays from the applicable ILS-S processed date or the
        Degraded Operations date.
           10.2.2.3.3.1. The serial numbers for each transaction will be listed on the
           management notice in conjunction with the output (source) document. All serial
           numbers are left justified. The COMSEC serial numbers will not be prefixed by
           zeros unless the zero is part of the COMSEC serial number.
           10.2.2.3.3.2. Document Control will file a copy of the management notice along
           with the source document.
           10.2.2.3.3.3. Degraded Operations procedures and hand scribed documents will
           be held for processing until the ILS-S becomes available and recovery
           transactions are processed. Ensure correct serial numbers are transcribed on the
           documents.
        10.2.2.3.4. COMSEC/CCI items are identified with Serialized Report Code (SRC)
        “C” or “R” for COMSEC/CCI stock numbers that are also NWRM, and are coded
        with MMAC CA, CK, CO, or CY.
        10.2.2.3.5. If a transaction at base level increases or decreases the base asset position,
        a Daily Change Report is generated under program control. If the ERRCD is
        NF2/ND2 type account E, the daily change report is forwarded to AFEMS (C001).
        (These change report images are placed in the same file as the images which go to
        AFEMS (C001) for Daily Equipment Transaction reporting). AFEMS (C001)
        updates the AFEMS database and forward the images to AFEMS (ACOM screen) to
        update the central file. Daily Change Reports for ERRCD XB/XF/XD type account B
        items are sent directly to AFEMS (ACOM screen).
        10.2.2.3.6. The actual serial numbers for each item coded with SRC C is maintained
        on either a 249 Serialized Control Detail Record or a 250 In-Use Serialized Control
        Detail Record.
           10.2.2.3.6.1. Serial numbers for items in serviceable stock or on an unserviceable
           detail, regardless of ERRCD, are maintained on 249 Serialized Control Detail
           records.
           10.2.2.3.6.2. Serial numbers for items coded as equipment will transfer to 250 In-
           Use Serialized Control Detail records when issued to the customer. (For example:
           If you are authorized three COMSEC assets on an in-use detail and have three on-
           hand there will be three 250 in-use serialized control records linked to that in-use
           detail.) Serial numbers for items maintained on a detail (i.e., MRSP, MSK,
           SPRAM, WRM, and supply point) are also accounted for on 250 In-Use
           Serialized Control records.
        10.2.2.3.7. The LRS CC/AO will not track type account B COMSEC assets (ERRCD
        XB/XF/XD) once they are issued to the using organization.
     10.2.2.4. COMSEC Reconciliation. All COMSEC assets on detail records or on hand in
     supply will be reconciled semiannually with AFEMS (C001) for type account code B and
     E assets. AFEMS (C001) will process the type E COMSEC assets reconciliation data
376                                                         AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      received into the AFEMS database and then forward those images to AFEMS (ACOM
      screen) for processing of the reconciliation. AFEMS (ACOM screen) will process the
      data received from AFEMS (C001) and the type account B COMSEC assets data
      received straight from the bases.
         10.2.2.4.1. Reconciliation actions. Prior to 15 March and 15 September process the
         edit option of the Weapon/COMSEC Reconciliation program (position 64 equals a
         dash(-) see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 of additional processing instructions).
         This option will compare the on-hand balance and detail balance to serialized control
         records. An error listing is produced for records that do not pass edits. When all
         reporting errors are corrected and any out-of-balance conditions have been resolved,
         process the Weapon/COMSEC Reconciliation program again (with C in position 66
         of the program select card) to create the outbound SIFS file.
         10.2.2.4.2. Non-receipt. AFEMS (ACOM screen) sends a COMSEC Control Reject
         Report with ERROR MESSAGE: “The required semiannual reconciliation report
         was not received” to any base which fails to process the reconciliation as required.
         Take action to have the reconciliation report processed with C in position 66 of the
         report parameter (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for additional assistance with
         processing the Weapon/COMSEC Reconciliation program.
         10.2.2.4.3. The LRS CC/AO does not maintain visibility of type account B
         COMSEC/CCI (ERRC XD/XF/XB) assets once they are issued to the using
         organization, therefore; they are not included in the reconciliation. However, the ILS-
         S will report serial numbers for these items when they are shipped.
         10.2.2.4.4. Out-of-Cycle Reconciliation. AFMC Cryptological System Activity may
         direct out-of-cycle reconciliations reports with MAJCOM approval. Out-of-cycle
         reconciliations and transmission of data will follow the same schedule/actions as
         scheduled reconciliations.
      10.2.2.5. COMSEC Control Error Notification.
         10.2.2.5.1. AFEMS Processing. AFEMS processes COMSEC serialized control
         reports from bases daily. When an error is detected by the AFEMS, a COMSEC
         Control Reject Record is transmitted to the reporting SRAN according to COMSEC
         Control Reject Report (XHB) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10. Error notification
         codes and possible corrective actions for these rejects are defined in COMSEC Error
         Notification Codes in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10.
         10.2.2.5.2. Base Corrective Action. Bases will correct the errors, change the
         transaction ID in positions 1-3 to a COMSEC Control Report and the RIC in positions
         4-6 to FNL for type accounts B and E COMSEC assets. Then transmit within 5
         calendar days of receipt of error notification. Transmission will be the same as used
         for daily transaction. Bases which have problems correcting COMSEC error
         notification code rejects should contact AFMC Cryptological System Activity prior to
         resubmission.
      10.2.2.6. SRC Changes.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  377


        10.2.2.6.1. Verification. When the SRC changes from a “C” or “R” to blank or blank
        to “C” or “R” a F118 Management Notice is generated by program control. The F118
        Mgmt Notice will print the Catalog Management Data Change Record input image
        with a clear text statement indicating the change “to” and “from” SRC. Customer
        Support must verify the change with AFMC Cryptological System Activity. See AFH
        23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for Weapons Serialized Control-Format Two format and
        entry requirements
        10.2.2.6.2. Procedures for Valid Changes. If the SRC change is valid, take action to
        add or delete the applicable 249/250 serialized control detail record(s). Note: The
        Catalog Management Data Change Record input will not allow the serialized report
        code to be deleted if 249/250 serialized control details are loaded.
        10.2.2.6.3. Procedures for Invalid Changes. For invalid changes, reprocess the
        Catalog Management Data Change Record to input the correct SRC. See AFH 23-
        123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 8 for additional instructions on transaction processing.
     10.2.2.7. COMSEC Serial Number Transaction Processing.
        10.2.2.7.1. When processing transactions that affect the total on hand or detail
        quantity normal processing procedures will apply. However, if you process a
        transaction for a partial quantity you must identify specific serial numbers before the
        in-line transaction is processed.
           10.2.2.7.1.1. An F117 Management Notice listing the serial number(s) will be
           printed in conjunction with output documents created as a result of a completed
           transaction.
           10.2.2.7.1.2. All SRC C and R items must have a corresponding 249 or 250
           serialized control record loaded or transactions will reject.
           10.2.2.7.1.3. Use Serialized Control Inputs (XS1) to load, change, or deleted
           serialized control details. A Forced Record Alteration is no longer required to
           change serialized control serial numbers. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for
           additional instructions.
               10.2.2.7.1.3.1. The Chief Inspector is the only person authorized to process a
               Serialized Control Input to change the serial number on serialized control
               details for NWRM (SRC R items). Notify the NTCC of the serial number
               change.
           10.2.2.7.1.4. Because of the likelihood of receiving an error condition, limit the
           quantity to 80 on related transactions (issues, receipts, etc.) involving serialized
           control details. If more than 80 serial numbers are involved, break up the
           transaction for multiple inputs.
        10.2.2.7.2. Issues.
           10.2.2.7.2.1. Issue of total on-hand quantity to a detail. If the total on-hand
           quantity is being issued to a detail (i.e., MRSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM, Supply
           Point) normal issue procedures apply. The applicable 249 serialized control
           record(s) is deleted and 250 an in-use serialized control record(s) established by
           program control. The new 250 in-use serialized control record(s) will reflect the
378                                                    AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


      last four positions of the detail document number.
      10.2.2.7.2.2. Issue of partial on-hand quantity to a detail. If less than the total on-
      hand quantity is being issued to a detail, you must identify the serial number(s)
      you want to issue.
         10.2.2.7.2.2.1. When processing serial numbers from serialized control
         records coordinate with warehouse personnel to determine which serial
         numbers to identify.
         10.2.2.7.2.2.2. Process a COMSEC Serialized Control Input-Format Two
         with the phrase “ISU/DOR” in the type phrase field to load an “I” in the
         receipt code field of the 249 serialized control detail record. After the
         record(s) are flagged, normal issue procedures apply. The applicable 249
         serialized control record(s) is deleted and a new 250 in-use serialized control
         record(s) established. The 250 in-use serialized control record(s) reflects the
         last four positions of the detail document number.
      10.2.2.7.2.3. Issue to an organization.
         10.2.2.7.2.3.1. Serial number accountability for type account B items (ERRC
         XD/XF/XB) becomes the responsibility of the using organization at the time
         of issue.
         10.2.2.7.2.3.2. If the total on-hand quantity is being issued normal issue
         procedures apply. For type account E items, the 249 serialized control
         record(s) is deleted and a new 250 in-use serialized control record(s) is
         established reflecting the last four positions of the in-use document number.
         10.2.2.7.2.3.3. Issue of partial on-hand quantity to an organization. If less
         than the total on-hand quantity is being issued you must identify the serial
         number(s) you want to issue. Process a COMSEC Serialized Control Input-
         Format Two with the phrase “ISU/DOR” to load an “I” in the receipt code
         field of the 249 serialized control detail record. After the records are flagged,
         normal issue procedures apply. For type account E items, the 249 serialized
         control detail record(s) is deleted and a 250 in-use serialized control record(s)
         is established reflecting the last four positions of the in-use document number.
         Serial number accountability for type account B items (ERRC XD/XF/XB)
         becomes the responsibility of the using organization at the time of issue.
      10.2.2.7.2.4. Issue of total quantity from a detail. If the total detail quantity is
      being issued normal issue procedures apply. The 250 in-use serialized control
      detail record(s) is deleted and 250 in-use serialized control detail record(s) is
      established for type account E items, reflecting the last four positions of the in-use
      document number.
      10.2.2.7.2.5. Issue of partial on-hand quantity from a detail. If less than the total
      detail quantity is being issued you must identify the serial number(s) you want to
      issue. Process a COMSEC Serialized Control Input-Format Two with “MSI” in
      the first three positions of the type phrase field to load an “M” to the 250 in-use
      serialized control record. After the records are flagged, normal Issue from Detail
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    379


            procedures apply. The 250 in-use serialized control records identified are deleted
            and a new 250 in-use serialized control record(s) is established for type account E
            items reflecting the last four positions of the in-use document number.
                10.2.2.7.2.5.1. When an issue from a detail record is processed, the issue
                programs will try to replenish the detail unless an “F” is in position 54 of the
                issue from detail record input. If the on-hand balance is greater than the
                replenishment quantity the replenishment issue will reject unless the
                applicable 249 serialized control records are identified for issue. Process all
                Issues (from a detail) for serialized control items with an F in position 54 to
                avoid rejects.
                10.2.2.7.2.5.2. You cannot process an issue from one detail to another detail.
                Process a return from the “issuing” detail to the item record then process an
                issue to the “gaining” detail.
     10.2.2.7.3. Returns.
            10.2.2.7.3.1. Total detail quantity being returned. If the total detail quantity is
            being returned normal return procedures apply. The 250 in-use serialized control
            detail record(s) is deleted and a 249 serialized control detail record(s) is
            established.
            10.2.2.7.3.2. Return of partial quantity from a detail. If less than the total detail
            quantity is being returned you must identify the serial numbers being returned.
            Process a COMSEC Serialized Control Input-Format Two with the phrase
            “TURN-IN” in the type phrase field to load a “T” to the 250 in-use serialized
            control detail record. After the records are flagged, normal return procedures
            apply. The 250 in-use serialized control detail record(s) will be deleted and 249
            serialized control record(s) established.
            10.2.2.7.3.3. Return of items not on a detail. Process a COMSEC Serialized
            Control Input-Format Two with “TURN-IN” in the type phrase field to load a 249
            serialized control detail record. After the serialized control record is established
            normal return procedures apply. Caution: COMSEC/CCI found on base may
            constitute a potential compromise of classified information and will be reported
            immediately upon discovery in accordance with AFI 31-401. For NWRM items,
            see AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions.
        10.2.2.7.4. Shipments. Shipments from details are not allowed. Items on in-use
        serialized control details must be returned to stock before shipment processing. Note:
        Transfer is authorized for RSP, MSK, SPRAM, Authorized In-Use and WRM details
        (see Para. 10.2.2.7.8 below for transfer procedures). See Sec. 5D, Equipment
        Management for Equipment Transfers between SRANs.
            10.2.2.7.4.1. The maximum amount of serial numbers that can be shipped with
            one input is 50 (fifty).
            10.2.2.7.4.2. For shipments of entire on-hand warehouse balance, normal
            shipment procedures apply.
            10.2.2.7.4.3. Shipment from a detail. Individual shipments from details are not
380                                                    AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


         allowed. Process a return from the detail and ship from the item record. Prior to
         processing the return and shipment , process a COMSEC Serialized Control
         Input-Format Two to flag each serial number or a 615 reject will occur (see AFH
         23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for proper Type Phrase Codes). Note: Redistribution
         Orders/Referrals from MSK and Supply Point Details may be processed.
         10.2.2.7.4.4. Shipment of partial on-hand quantity. If less than the total detail
         quantity is being shipped you must identify the serial number(s) to ship. Process
         a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with the type phrase ‘ISU/DOR’
         to prepare the serialized control detail for shipment. Note: Warner Robins (WR-
         ALC) is no longer the storage site for weapons. Ensure weapons being returned
         to Depot are shipped to the Anniston Army Depot ( FY1346)
      10.2.2.7.5. Receipts. Prior to processing a REC for a COMSEC item you must
      process a Serialized COMSEC Control Input-Format Two with the phrase
      “SHIPPED” in the type phrase field to load the 249 serialized control record. When
      the receipt transaction is processed a F117 Management Notice is produced. Once
      the REC is processed the Receipt Code field of the 249 control record is changed to
      an “R” to signify the property was received and program control will generate a
      COMSEC Control Report to update AFEMS (C001). If the 249 control record(s) is
      not loaded, when the receipt is processed, the program will generate a 616 Reject.
      You must take action to load the 249 records before the receipt can be reprocessed.
      Note: All elements of the 249 record (i.e., suffix code, due-in number, MMAC) must
      match the REC input or the transaction will reject.
      10.2.2.7.6. Record reversal and correction Transactions. Prior to these transactions
      process a serial Serialized COMSEC Control Input-Format Two to create/delete the
      applicable 249/250 serialized control record.
      10.2.2.7.7. Deployment Procedures.
         10.2.2.7.7.1. Deployment of total detail quantity. If you deploy the total on-hand
         quantity of the detail (MRSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM or Authorized In-use)
         normal deployment processing procedures apply. The deployed routing identifier
         will be stored on the applicable 250 serialized control records.
         10.2.2.7.7.2. Deployment of less than total detail quantity. If you deploy less
         than the total on hand detail quantity process a Serialized COMSEC Control
         Input-Format Two with type phrase “DEPLOY” to load a “D” in the ACTION-
         CODE field of the 250 record. After the records are flagged, normal deployment
         processing procedures apply. Program control will delete the “D” from the 250
         serialized control record and load the deployed routing identifier to the control
         records.
         10.2.2.7.7.3. Total quantity returned from deployment. If you return the total
         deployed quantity normal return deployment processing procedures apply. The
         deployed routing identifier will be deleted from the applicable 250 serialized
         control records under program control when the return is processed.
         10.2.2.7.7.4. Partial quantity returned from deployment. If you return less than
         the total quantity deployed process a Serialized COMSEC Control Input-Format
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   381


            Two with type phrase “RETURN” to load an “R” in the ACTION-CODE field of
            the 250 record. After the records are flagged, normal return deployment
            processing procedures apply. The deployed routing identifier will be deleted from
            the applicable 250 serialized control records by program control.
        10.2.2.7.8. Transfer Procedures.
            10.2.2.7.8.1. Transfer of total detail quantity. If you transfer the total on-hand
            quantity of the detail (MRSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM or In-use) normal transfer
            processing procedures apply. Daily Change Reports will be generated under
            program control to update AFEMS (C001) and AFEMS (ACOM screen). In
            addition, Daily Change Reports images are created for forwarding to the gaining
            base to establish 249 serialized control records.
            10.2.2.7.8.2. Transfer of less than total detail quantity. If you transfer less than
            the total on-hand detail quantity process a Serialized COMSEC Control Input-
            Format Two with type phrase “TRANFER” (Note the spelling of this phrase) to
            load a “T” in the 1st position of the ACTION-CODE field of the 250 record.
            After the records are flagged, normal transfer processing procedures apply. Daily
            Change Reports will be generated under program control to update AFEMS
            (C001) and AFEMS (ACOM screen). In addition, images are created for
            forwarding to the gaining base to establish 249 serialized control records.
  10.2.3. Processing actions for Removal/Installation of Controlled Cryptographic Items
  (CCI).
     10.2.3.1. Purpose: Provide procedures for the processing and documentation of CCI
     removal/installation .
     10.2.3.2. Controlled Maintenance activities use AFTO Form 781L, to provide control for
     serial number CCI and as an aid in serial number accountability. See T.O. 00-20-1 for
     additional information.
     10.2.3.2.1. When CCI is removed and a like item is installed at a transient base, an
     AFTO Form 781L is sent to LRS/ Materiel Management Activity. Materiel Management
     personnel will process a COMSEC Control Report (XHA) for transmission to AFMC
     Cryptological System Activity. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for format.
        10.2.3.2.2. Home Station CCI Removal Processing Procedures. When an aircraft or
        ground mobile communications center, etc., returns to its home station, the home
        station maintenance activity must also forward a copy of the AFTO Form 781L to the
        LRS/ Materiel Management Activity COMSEC monitor. Process a COMSEC
        Serialized Control Input-Format Two. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for
        information on applicable ILS-S transaction processing.
     10.2.3.3. Document Control of CCI Replacements.
        10.2.3.3.1. At the transient base and the home base, Document Control must annotate
        or stamp the “Comments” line with "Received by (signature of Document Control
        clerk and date)."
        10.2.3.3.2. Forward a copy of the document to the maintenance activity that provided
        the form to LRS/Materiel Management Activity.
 382                                                          AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


          10.2.3.3.3. File the form for 2 years from the date received by the Document Control
          personnel.
       10.2.3.4. The following results when all actions have been properly completed by the
       transient base and the home base:
          10.2.3.4.1. The transient LRS/Materiel Management Activity knows that the home
          base serial number now belongs to the transient base, and serialized control
          transactions were prepared accordingly.
          10.2.3.4.2. The home LRS/Materiel Management Activity knows that the transient
          base serial number now belongs to the home base, and serialized control transactions
          were prepared accordingly.
          10.2.3.4.3. The AFMC Cryptological System Activity knows the CCI formerly
          located at base A is now located at base B, and the CCI formerly located at base B is
          now located at base A.
   10.2.4. Documentation of Transfer of CCI Assets from Base Level Maintenance
   Organizations to Depot Level.
       10.2.4.1. Purpose: To provide procedures for the documentation of transfer of CCI assets
       from base maintenance organizations to depot level.
       10.2.4.2. If an aircraft must be sent to a repair depot for maintenance and a CCI asset is
       aboard, the home base maintenance activity reports this by AFTO Form 781L.
          10.2.4.2.1. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity COMSEC monitor at the losing
          base enters the NSN and serial number in the COMSEC Control Report in positions
          8-37 and leaves positions 38-67 blank. The host LRS/Materiel Management Activity
          COMSEC monitor of the repair depot will enter the same NSN and serial number in
          positions 38-67 and leave positions 8-37 blank. This combined processing action
          notifies The AFMC Cryptological System Activity that a CCI asset formerly located
          at a using base is now located at a repair depot. The host LRS/Materiel Management
          Activity at AFMC depots will follow the procedures in AFMC regulations for
          obtaining the required information from the depot.
       10.2.4.2.2. Other Service Performed Maintenance. If a CCI is removed and replaced at
       another-service installation (Army, Navy, etc.), the home base maintenance activity
       forwards the completed AFTO Form 781L to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity
       COMSEC monitor. The monitor prepares COMSEC Control Report (XHA) for
       transaction processing (See AFH 23-122, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10). The other-service
       installation reports the serial number change to their central office of record using their
       own established procedures.
   10.2.5. Special Logistics Support Procedures for Special Access Parts.
       10.2.5.1. Purpose: This section identifies support procedures.
          10.2.5.1.1. Special Logistics Support for Special Access Program (SAP) parts will
          comply with:
10.2.5.1.2. AFPD 16-7, Special Access Programs.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                  383

     10.2.5.2. SAP assets will not be commingled with normal classified or communication
     security property.
  10.2.6. NWRM Transactions.
     10.2.6.1. Purpose: Describes procedures related to identifying/managing NWRM. See
     AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for applicable ILS-S requirements for identifying
     NWRM.
     10.2.6.2. The NWRM Transaction Control Cell (NTCC) approves all transactions prior
     to processing and will remove/replace the NWRM freeze code as appropriate.
     10.2.6.3. Follow the procedures for processing serialized controlled (COMSEC/CCI)
     assets through the ILS-S.
        10.2.6.3.1. Specific rules apply when processing transactions for serialized controlled

XHB—COMSEC Control Input
ZOP—Zero Overpricing Program (now called the Price Challenge & Verification Program)

Terms
Acquisition Lead Time (ALT)—The sum of the administrative lead time and production lead
time.
Active Inventory—Materiel that is expected to be consumed within the budget year (2 years)
and materiel that has been purchased to meet specific war reserve requirements.
Actual Unit Price—The latest contract price plus inflation and first destination transportation
costs. This price is intended to approximate the price the item will cost on next acquisition.
Additive Requirement—Requirements that are supported by projected requirements (e.g.,
modifications) rather than past demand experience. Requirements computed outside the
recoverable computation.
Aircraft Parts Store—LRS function located near flight line maintenance and functions as a
demand processing unit, customer support, and aircraft parts warehouse for maintenance
activities.
Aircraft Sustainability Model (ASM)—The mathematical model used to determine the
requirements for recoverable RSP items (in the D087G system) It uses a unit's wartime flying
hour program, the range of items determined at the annual review, and the demand
rate/indicative data for each item to determine the optimum mix of spares to achieve the target
direct support objective (DSO).
Allowance Standard (AS)—Authorized document that identifies the amount and type of
equipment for an organization.
Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO)—The quantity of an item authorized for peacetime
and wartime requirements to equip and sustain U.S. and Allied Forces, according to current DoD
policies and plans. That quantity shall be sufficient to support other U.S. Government Agencies,
as applicable.
Awaiting Parts (AWP)—During the repair process for systems/equipment, parts are ordered for
the system/equipment undergoing repair or an end item is being scheduled for a repair process
and parts are ordered for a scheduled repair of the system/equipment to start the repair process.
The end item system/equipment undergoing repair/being scheduled for repair is AWP when the
parts to continue the repair process are backordered or the scheduled repair process will exceed
mission requirements.
Base Condemnation Rate—The number of base condemnations divided by the sum base RTS
and base condemnations.
Base Consumption Rates—Base consumption rates will be determined by taking the number of
failures at base level, over a specific period of time, divided by the operating program for that
same time period.
Base Not Repairable this Station (NRTS) Rate—The number of Base NRTS divided by the
sum of the base RTS, base NRTS, and base condemnations.
 406                                                            AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013


Base Repair Cycle—The number of days that elapse between the time an unserviceable
reparable item is removed from use and the time it is made serviceable and ready for issue.
Base Stock Level—This level is computed in support of the base requisitioning objective
Bench Stocks—Stores of expendability, recoverability, reparability coded (ERRC) XB3 items
kept on-hand in a work center to enhance maintenance productivity.
Business Overhead Cost Recovery (BOCR)—BOCR@LAC/LRC is the portion of the cost
recovery element that represents indirect and direct overhead costs. Examples are various Supply
Operations Costs, DLADS, DISA, DFAS, Materiel Inflation, AORs, DLA distribution
issue/receipts costs, and transportation costs. BOCR is applied as a flat percentage, to the LAC
and the LRC, across all NSNs.
C-Factor—Multiplier of the standard deviation (square root of the variance) of demand during
replenishment. The ILS-S uses the C-factor to selectively increase item special level quantities
for stocked items. The C-factor assignment policy is based on item mission impact, historical
demand, and unit price criteria.
Calendar Time Change Items—Items requiring replacement at regular intervals as specified in
appropriate technical orders.
Carcass Cost (CC)—The value of an asset when the LRC plus BOCR have been removed from
the standard price of the item. Carcass cost is also equal to the LAC minus the LRC.
Care of Supplies in Storage (COSIS)—Program composed of a set of processes and procedures
whose purpose is to ensure that materiel in storage is maintained in ready-for-issue condition or
to prevent uneconomic deterioration of unserviceable materiel.
Cataloging—Act of naming, classifying, describing, and numbering each item repetitively used,
purchased, stocked, or distributed to distinguish each item from every other item. Also included
is the maintenance of information related to the item and the dissemination of that information to
item users.
Cataloging Tools—The process of initiating and enhancing documents and procedures required
to research, record, and organize logistics information.
Central Procurement—The purchase of materiel, supplies or services by an officially
designated command or agency with funds specifically provided for such procurement for the
benefit and use of the entire component or the military departments as a whole.
Central Secondary Item Stratification (CSIS)—An automated capability that applies to
wholesale and retail asset and requirements data. The CSIS shall uniformly display the materiel
requirements and associated asset status of individual secondary items and generate summaries
of essential information. If a methodology other than stratification is used as a foundation, an
audit trail to the applicable stratification table shall be submitted to the USD(L&MR). Secondary
item assets shall be stratified at least semiannually. One stratification shall be as of September 30
(for inventory reporting and funding reviews), and the other shall be as of March 31 (for budget
preparation).
Classes of Supply—Not to be confused with Federal Supply Class, terminology used to divide
supplies and equipment into 10 easily identifiable categories of materiel that are depicted by
Roman Numerals.
AFMAN23-122 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     407


Classified Item—Controlled inventory item/materiel that require protection in the interest of
national security.
Commodity—A homogeneous aggregation of like items.
Communications-Electronics—Specialized field items concerned with the use of electronic
devices and systems for the acquisition, acceptance, processing, storage, display, analysis,
protection, disposition, and transfer of information.
Condemnation Requirement—Stock replacements for base and depot condemnations
Consumable Item—Item of supply (except explosive ordnance and major end items of
equipment) that is normally expended or used up beyond recovery in the use for which it is
designed or intended. Minor parts, tools, and hardware identified by ERRC designator XB3. NF1
items (with IEX E, K) are managed like consumable items. A consumable item cannot be
economically repaired by a field or depot maintenance activity. Accountability for consumable
items is terminated upon issue.

Customer Oriented Leveling Technique—Used to centrally compute levels for DLA-managed
items that have an established demand pattern.
Daily Demand Frequency Rate (DDFR)—The DDFR reflects the average daily number of
customer requests for an item. The DDFR differs from DDR in that DDFR is based on the
number of customer orders (requests), while DDR is based the number of units of stock
requested. DDFR is calculated by dividing the sum of customer requests by the number of days
since the item’s Date of First Demand (DOFD).
Daily Demand Rate—Average quantity of an item that is used daily. The ILS-S computes the
DDR using one of the following methods: (1) Bachelor or Substitute Item. Divide the item
cumulative recurring demand (CRD) by the difference of the current Julian date minus the
DOFD. If the demand experience available is less than 180 days, a difference of 180 mitigates
the effect of limited demand experience. (2) Master or Interchangeable Item. Divide the
cumulative recurring demand (CRD) for the master and all interchangeable items within the
group (for one system designator at a time) by the difference of the current Julian date minus the
oldest date of first demand in the master/interchangeable group. If the demand experience
