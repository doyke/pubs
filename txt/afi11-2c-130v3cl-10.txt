       LOADMASTER MAFFS CHECKLIST
This checklist establishes procedures for the operation of C-130
aircraft employed by Mobility Air Forces (MAF) to accomplish
their worldwide missions.
This checklist complements AFI 11-2C-130V3, C-130 Operations
Procedures, and is printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond paper then
trimmed to a unique size 4 ½ “ x 6 ½” that will fit the standard
plastic C-130 aircrew checklist binders. Units may request copies
of this checklist printed on a water proof-based media (in the size
outlined) from the OPR. This product reduces weight and
eliminates the need for plastic inserts. Limit water proof copies to
aircrew only for use in-flight and training purposes.
