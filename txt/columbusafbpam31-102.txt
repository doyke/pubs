This pamphlet provides guidance to custodians when conducting anti-robbery exercises for their
personnel. It provides detailed instructions on steps to be taken before, during and after an actual
or simulated robbery.

1. Introduction: Training is the key to a successful anti-robbery program. Without adequate
training, personnel are unaware of their responsibilities and duties. The potential for the loss or
theft of resources will dramatically increase.
2. Purpose: The purpose of this pamphlet is to provide all funds, firearms and/or munitions-
handling facility personnel with an easily accessible training package. This pamphlet covers
primary concerns, duties and responsibilities of all personnel associated with the facility
antirobbery plan.

3. Application: This pamphlet should be used as the primary training guide for the facility
antirobbery training and response plan as required in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense. Again,
this pamphlet is to be used for training purposes only and is not intended to replace the directives
of the Integrated Defense Plan (IDP).
4. :
     4.1. Concept: This section provides guidance and procedures in the event of a robbery. It
     also ensures facility managers and funds custodians are familiar with procedures and provide
     guidelines and assistance on conducting anti-robbery training for their assigned personnel.
     4.2. Tasks:
        4.2.1. Remain calm! Avoid any action that increases danger to yourself or others.
            4.2.1.1. Committing a rash act may result in your death or the death of someone in
            your facility.
            4.2.1.2. An example of this may be hesitating to immediately comply with the
            demands of the robber.
        4.2.2. Victims or co-workers must promptly activate the duress alarm system. This must
        be done ONLY WHEN SAFE TO DO SO.
            4.2.2.1. Activate the alarm when unseen by the robber or immediately after the
            robber has departed your facility.
            4.2.2.2. If you see a robbery in progress and it is safe to do so, calmly activate the
            nearest duress alarm or call the Emergency Communications Center (ECC) at 434-
            7128/7129 or dial 911. Stay on the line with the Desk Sergeant.
                4.2.2.2.1. Note the robber’s physical features, voice, accents, mannerisms, dress,
                kind of weapon and any other characteristics that would be useful for
                identification purposes.
                4.2.2.2.2. Compare your height and weight to the robber. Remember, even
                though men and women physically appear to be the same size, a man’s weight is
                approximately 30 pounds heavier.
                4.2.2.2.3. Complete the AF Form 439/Robbery Checklist.
5. :
     5.1. Introduction: Employ “in-house” anti-robbery exercises to examine the effectiveness
     of your antirobbery training program.
     5.2. Concept: The effect of an anti-robbery exercise will prepare your facility in the event
     of an actual robbery. A minimum of one “in-house” antirobbery exercise will be conducted
     annually. A copy of the complete report from this pamphlet (Attachment 2) will be
     submitted to
14 SFS/S5S and a copy will be filed in your Controlled Area Folder (refer to AFI 31-101/
Integrated Defense). Anti-robbery training will be conducted annually with all personnel.
Document the training, provide a copy of the training log to 14 SFS/S5S, and keep a copy of the
training in your Controlled Area Folder.

  5.3. Preparation for an Antirobbery “In-House” Exercise:
     5.3.1. Choose your evaluator and “robber.”
     5.3.2. Have the “Robber” fill out his/her description on an AF Form 439, Robbery
     Checklist to be utilized as a cross-reference later on.
     5.3.3. Conduct the exercise safety briefing with all involved personnel.
     5.3.4. Discuss the exercise scenario with the evaluator and “robber” prior to the exercise
     to ensure everyone understands his/her role.
     5.3.5. Pick the location, victim and avenues of escape.
     5.3.6. Give the “robber” evidence, such as fingerprints, to leave at the crime scene.
     5.3.7. Evaluate other personnel utilizing this pamphlet.
     5.3.8. Ensure other personnel are not aware the exercise is about to take place.
     5.3.9. Begin the exercise:
         5.3.9.1. Have the “robber” approach the victim and hand them the written note
         demanding simulated cash.
         5.3.9.2. Have the “robber” leave at least one item of physical evidence at the scene.
         5.3.9.3. Have the “robber” walk, run or drive away from the facility.
  5.4. Things to Remember During an “In-House” Exercise Only:
     5.4.1. Simulate activating the duress alarm.
     5.4.2. Simulate calling 911.
     5.4.3. Do not stop customers from entering or exiting the facility.
     5.4.4. Under no circumstances will actual cash be utilized.
