                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This manual implements the Collaboration Enterprise Core Service and Voice
Systems Management NetOps Service described in AFI 33-115, AF-GIG Services. Specific
procedures for Collaboration will be maintained in MPTO 00-33A-1110, Collaboration and
Messaging. Specific procedures for Voice Systems Management will be maintained in MPTO
00-33A-1108, Voice Systems Management. This manual is for use by individuals responsible for
implementation, acquisition, and management of electronic collaboration services, appliance
Video-Teleconferencing (VTC) equipment, and telephone services that are converging under UC
Real Time Services (RTS) establishing the basic guidance framework for Air Force personnel.
The scope for this publication includes information on policy, standards, reporting, requirements,
services, engineering, and systems management for use in complying with DoD and Air Force
instructions for UC RTS including collaboration, VTC communications connectivity, and
telephone services in the secure and non-secure interactive group environments. This manual
assists action officers who implement collaboration services (voice, video, and/or data) to satisfy
customer requirements and support the diverse major command missions. The use of Major
Command (MAJCOM) in this document refers to US Air Force Major Commands, Field
Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting Units (DRU).
1.2. DoD Unified Capabilities (UC). UC is the integration of voice, video, and/or data services
delivered ubiquitously across a secure and highly available network infrastructure, independent
of technology, to provide increased mission effectiveness to the warfighter and business
communities. The Air Force will integrate current with future network technologies to provide
UC (i.e., any single or combination of information media (voice, video, and/or data), whether
converged or non-converged) on Air Force and DoD networks.
1.3. Video-Teleconferencing (VTC). Legacy VTC capabilities are to be phased out with the
implementation of UC RTS. VTC is an electronic form of video telecommunications
(video/data/voice/imagery) which permits two or more people in separate geographic locations to
engage in real-time, interactive, face-to-face, video/audio communications. In many situations,
this electronic media can reduce the need for TDY travel to conduct face-to-face events such as
staff or technical meetings, briefings, conferences, interviews, work groups, project management
reviews, training, etc. Today's technology allows individuals to structure video equipment and
systems to meet the many and varied needs of our customers. It can be secure or non-secure,
terrestrial, or satellite transmission between two or more separate geographic locations. VTC
operation is two-way video/two-way audio.
1.4. Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE). The requiring unit, or its
MAJCOM, is responsible for the PPBE process for acquiring and maintaining legacy appliance
based VTC solutions and unique collaborative service not provided by Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA) or the Air Force enterprise. Equipment and systems shall be justified,
validated, funded, and installed in accordance with this Air Force Manual (AFMAN).

   (NCES) Defense Connect Online (DCO) video collaboration capability is a DISA provided,
   certified and accredited service that is available on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET.
   3.4.3. The use of a webcam, in support of DCO or other online video collaboration services,
   requires the Information Assurance Manager (IAM) to comply with the following C&A
   measures:
       3.4.3.1. Webcam must be passive USB plug & play device with no internal memory.
       3.4.3.2. Webcam must be Air Force Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) compliant.
       3.4.3.3. IAM must review DODI 8500.2 IA controls PEDI-1 and PRTN-1.
   3.4.4. If the webcam requires any additional software or drivers above what is provided by
   FDCC, then this software must undergo C&A. Compliance with DISA Video Tele-
   Conferencing STIG is mandatory for all VTC solutions.
3.5. VTC Maintenance and Training. Regardless of the VTC solution, a follow-on continual
need to program for operations, maintenance, and training support is necessary.
   3.5.1. Operations involve scheduling usage with on and off-site personnel and network
   central control offices; setup/tear down, initialization, and testing; operating room equipment
   during and between calls; maintaining usage records; troubleshooting and spares
   replacement.
   3.5.2. Equipment maintenance is usually provided by service agreements with the equipment
   vendor or by the enclave network service provider. The number of maintenance vendors
   used should be minimized to optimize support efficiencies.
   3.5.3. Both operator and user training is required and must include how to plan and control
   effective VTC sessions and the use of multimedia (graphics, recorded media, and live
   presentations) services. Training may be acquired from the VTC equipment vendor or from
   Government organizations with similar equipment. DISA provides VTC facilitator training
   by desktop tutorial (Level 1). On-site training is available at a DISA facility in Williamsburg
   VA (Level 2). For assistance contact parent MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU UC point of contact.
3.6. Accountability. Accountability of UC RTS and legacy VTC systems and equipment,
including studio, portable, and desktop appliance UC RTS and legacy VTC systems and
equipment, will be established according to AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property
in Possession of the Air Force, and AFI 33-112, Information Technology Hardware Asset
Management.
3.7. Requirements. MAJCOMs plan, program, budget, fund for local UC RTS or VTC
requirements not fulfilled by enterprise capabilities. Air Force organizations will not procure
deployable or fixed base VTC equipment without a validated technical solution for their
requirements and conformance with UC interoperability requirements and integration with UC
RTS. Organizations will coordinate all requirements (to include upgrades, modifications and
expansion) to the MAJCOM for review and approval, and to the CSI-B according to AFI 33-150,
Management of Cyberspace Support Activities, and TO 00-33-D-3003 for inclusion in the CIPS
blueprint.
   3.7.1. VTC Requirements. Every VTC requirement document contains basic elements such
   as the functional definition of the requirement, justification of the requirement, and the
AFMAN33-145 6 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                11


  technical solution and alternatives with associated costs. The solution should take into
  account acquisition, maintenance, updates, and disposition. For large appliance based
  solutions an initial capabilities document (ICD) should be created. VTC requirements
  planning and engineering require trade-offs (exchanging of some things for others as they are
  evaluated against each other). A specific solution for a VTC requirement depends on:
     3.7.1.1. Site/system specific functional/collaboration requirements.
     3.7.1.2. Communications connectivity requirements for existing and future sites.
     3.7.1.3. Available transmission media.
     3.7.1.4. International, Federal, and Military standards.
     3.7.1.5. Available equipment, services, and communications contracts.
     3.7.1.6. Available funds (for personnel, maintenance, training).
     3.7.1.7. Security requirements.
  3.7.2. VTC systems used for Command and Control (C2) shall be programmatically
  identified, accredited, and managed as a C2 system or a component of a C2 system. VTC
  systems used for C2 may also be used for general VTC requirements.
     3.7.2.1. Units must ensure system compliance with all DoD and AF C2 governing
     documentation, and shall provide the Assured Services Features from UCR 2008, Section
     4.3.1.
     3.7.2.2. VTC systems used for C2 cannot be certified as a component of an installation
     enclave and must obtain an independent Approval To Operate (ATO) for a C2 System.
     3.7.2.3. The most important consideration for implementing new technology is the
     impact on mission requirements. Implementing any such technology must first and
     foremost not degrade the C2 services currently being provided.

                                          Chapter 4

                                LEGACY VOICE SYSTEMS

4.1. Requesting Telephone and Telephone-Related Service.
   4.1.1. The Communications and Information Services Officer (CSO) will:
       4.1.1.1. Accept base telephone service workorders and process these workorders in a
       timely manner to establish, add, change, or delete voice services according to established
       local policy.
       4.1.1.2. Submit major voice system requirements, to include upgrades, modifications,
       and expansion, as well as requirements that cannot be solved at the host-base to the
       MAJCOM for review and approval, and to the CSI-B according to AFI 33-150 and TO
       00-33D-3003 for inclusion in the CIPS blueprint.
       4.1.1.3. Establish a competitive contract through the applicable contracting office using
       AF IMT 9, Request for Purchase, or Communications Service Authorization (CSA) using
       AF IMT 1218, Request for Communications Service. A CSA is needed in areas where a
       public utility commission requires tariffed or regulated services (e.g., central office
       trunking, business lines, foreign exchange [FX] service). Ensure funds are available and
       certified prior to contract award. Use AF IMT 1218 to establish new CSAs or to submit
       changes to existing CSAs. Reference TO 00-33D-2002, Engineering Installation
       Activities Management, for 38 CEIG services.
       4.1.1.4. Solicit and obtain competitive bids or proposals through designated and
       appropriate procurement channels for all voice services.
       4.1.1.5. Ensure that the special telephone and voice requirements for people with
       disabilities are addressed according to 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1194.23 of
       the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, document,
       December 21, 2000 (http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm).
   4.1.2. MAJCOMs will:
       4.1.2.1. Establish procedures ensuring new or changes to existing CSAs are consistent
       with the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Plan and
       schedule timely establishment and/or renewal of telephone service contracts with
       required agencies and the contracting officer (DFARS Part 239, Acquisition of
       Information Technology, Subpart 239.74, Telecommunications Services).
       4.1.2.2. Monitor CSAs under their control for adequate funding authority and to ensure
       that decentralized reporting of expenditures is accomplished as prescribed by the
       contracting officer.
       4.1.2.3. Follow procedures and fulfill additional roles and responsibilities for voice
       systems defined in MPTO 00-33A-1108, Voice Systems Management.
4.2. Competitive Long Distance Voice Service. When FTS-2001 (or its designated
replacement) service is not available (e.g., certain locations outside the continental United
States), follow the guidelines in AFI 33-116, Long-Haul Telecommunications Management, to
AFMAN33-145 6 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                     13


request competitive long distance voice service. MAJCOMs may provide flat rate, long distance,
non-reimbursable voice service to tenants authorized Class A-1 service if the host base also uses
this service. When the host base does not require flat rate, long distance service, such a service
is a special requirement and the tenant must pay for it.
4.3. Official Telephone Service in Personal Quarters.
   4.3.1. Title 31, United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 1348 (31 U.S.C. 1348), Money And
   Finance; The Budget Process; Appropriations; Limitations, Exceptions, And Penalties;
   Telephone installation and charges, permits certain officials to have government-assigned
   telephones installed and maintained in their quarters, if necessary for national defense
   purposes. Limited telephone service for official use may be provided to those officials. Do
   not delegate the authority to designate these personnel to members below wing commanders
   or equivalent levels. Base such designations on functional position and mission impact.
       4.3.1.1. See Attachment 2 for conditions and arrangements for official telephone service
       in quarters if DSN on netting and call forwarding universal for off netting does not meet
       requirements as the preferred technical solution.
       4.3.1.2. Personnel authorized official telephone service in quarters must provide separate
       personal telephone service at his or her own expense from the local commercial
       telephone company or the government-furnished exchange (Class B service).
       4.3.1.3. When local, unofficial service is not available or the waiting period for service is
       unacceptable, the MAJCOM/A6 (or equivalent) may waive requirements to permit dual
       usage of the official telephone. The user must pay:
           4.3.1.3.1. The one-time cost, if any, for conversion to this service.
           4.3.1.3.2. A monthly service charge equal to the charge for Class B service.
           4.3.1.3.3. The cost of toll calls or other charges for unofficial use.
   4.3.2. Flexiplace/Telecommunicating Support to Alternative Work Sites. Public Law (PL)
   104-52, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1996,
   Section 620 (Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1348 note), provides that appropriated funds may be
   used to install telephone lines and necessary equipment, and to pay monthly charges in any
   private residence or private apartment of a federal civilian employee who is authorized to
   work at home in accordance with guidelines issued by the Office of Personnel Management.
   The head of the department, division, bureau, or office must certify that adequate safeguards
   against private misuse exist, and that the service is necessary for direct support of the
   agency’s mission.
       4.3.2.1. Unit commanders, in coordination with the local personnel office, may authorize
       federal civilian employees to work at an approved flexiplace location. Unit commanders
       may also authorize the installation of a personal computer, applicable software, modems,
       fax machines, and data lines to support access at the alternate work location (PL 104-52).
       Unit commanders should work with the supporting communications unit to identify the
       necessary support requirements and restrictions.
       4.3.2.2. The unit commander authorizing the alternate work location must:
 14                                                     AFMAN33-145 6 SEPTEMBER 2012


          4.3.2.2.1. Determine government-provided communications service is necessary for
          direct support of the agency’s mission.
          4.3.2.2.2. Fund necessary equipment and phone lines needed to support the mission.
          4.3.2.2.3. Make sure the alternate work location is an economical option to having
          the individual work in the office.
          4.3.2.2.4. Authorize payment for installation and monthly recurring charges.
          4.3.2.2.5. Certify that adequate monitoring capability and safeguards against private
          misuse exist. Such certification should accompany a signed federal civilian
          employees flexiplace agreement.
          4.3.2.2.6. Account for government-provided equipment on a hand receipt and
          inventory annually.
      4.3.2.3. After approval, base communications units will work with the requiring activity
      to establish the service and required safeguards.
      4.3.2.4. Because of the restrictions pertaining to the use of appropriated funds to support
      telephone service in private quarters, requesting unit commanders must certify that
      support requested under this provision is for an approved flexiplace location as defined
      by Air Force personnel guidance. Certification must accompany the communications and
      information systems requirement and be retained by the communications office as long as
      service or equipment is provided to the flexiplace location.
4.4. Air Force Guidance on Voice Mail/Messaging Systems.
   4.4.1. When procuring new or replacement stand-alone Voice Mail/Messaging Systems
   (VMS), installations will integrate with either the base voice system or the telephone service
   provider until voice mail services are available to the base from UC RTS.
   4.4.2. Communications units should evaluate the base-wide requirement for voice mail and
   plan for a centralized solution compliant with the transition to UC RTS.
   4.4.3. When evaluating options for satisfying user needs, the analysis must examine service
   and total cost of ownership to acquire, install, and sustain the system over its expected life
   cycle.
   4.4.4. The MAJCOM/A6 (or equivalent) can approve a waiver to purchase new or expand
   existing stand-alone VMS when the mission and business case is compelling and documented
   to be the best value to the Air Force.
4.5. Air Force Guidance on Music on Hold.
   4.5.1. Any primary broadcast of music (e.g., music played directly from tape, compact disc,
   or other source) into a voice system must comply with licensing and copyright requirements
   under applied Federal, state, and local laws.
   4.5.2. The use of royalty-free music is highly recommended. However, broadcasts from the
   Air Force News Agency are the preferred solution wherever possible. The Air Force News
   Agency provides an ―Air Force Radio News on Hold‖ service that can feed into most Air
   Force switches. Please contact Air Force News, AFNEWS/NSOE, DSN 945-1363, for
   further information concerning the Air Force Radio News broadcasts.
AFMAN33-145 6 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  15


   4.5.3. Prior to approving rebroadcast of music into a voice system, the installation
   commander should consider the potential for complaints of preferential treatment or implied
   endorsement by the Air Force based upon the choice of radio station, and the potential for
   negative public reaction to broadcasts that may contain controversial, offensive, or political
   content.
4.6. Air Force Instruction on Lead Telecommunications Cables. The following applies:
   4.6.1. For Commercial Telephone Company-Owned Cables:
       4.6.1.1. Do not accept ―abandoned‖ cables from any commercial telephone company
       without first consulting your base legal office, base civil engineering environmental
       flight, installation bio-environmental engineer, the environmental management office,
       and MAJCOM. Abandoned cables often contain materials (i.e., lead) which are
       environmental hazards. Accepting ownership may make the Air Force responsible for its
       removal and liable for any damages caused by the hazardous materials.
   4.6.2. For Government-Owned Cables:
       4.6.2.1. Coordinate with base civil engineering environmental flight or environmental
       management office, and the installation bio-environmental engineer before repairing,
       excavating, or removing cables suspected of containing lead. The environmental
       engineering team can offer advice on how to minimize health risks and Air Force
       liability.
4.7. Air Force Instruction on Malicious Call Trace (MCT) or Customer Originated Trace.
   4.7.1. The host CSO will establish local MCT procedures to address harassing, prank, bomb
   threat, 911 hang-ups, or other emergency type calls that need to be identified.
   4.7.2. Procedures should be clearly published in the base telephone directory if available and
   on appropriate visual aid forms posted next to the AF Form 440, Bomb Threat Aid.
   4.7.3. The host CSO must work with the local security forces, Air Force Office of Special
   Investigations, and Staff Judge Advocate, to ensure responsibilities are outlined and
   appropriate equipment (e.g., line printers) are installed in designated places.
   4.7.4. For standardization purposes from base-to-base, all sites will utilize the access code
   feature *57 to initiate a MCT. If an existing voice switch already has *57 assigned for
   another feature, reassign the existing feature a new access code and ensure *57 when MCT is
   used.
   4.7.5. When a MCT is activated by an end user on base and the originating calling number is
   not displayed or unknown, applicable law enforcement personnel should immediately contact
   the telephone maintenance office for additional assistance. When contacted by law
   enforcement, these personnel can utilize other tools (e.g., voice protection system [VPS],
   TMS, switch logs, etc.) to help trace calls that are either still on-line or have hung up.
4.8. Voice Service for Geographically Separated Units. Small off-base units, such as Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps detachments, get voice services through the commander of a host
support base. The host support base communications unit activity processes bills using a fund
citation provided by the parent MAJCOM.
4.9. Unofficial Commercial Telephone/Voice Service.
 16                                                      AFMAN33-145 6 SEPTEMBER 2012


4.9.1. In Air Force-Owned Facilities Other Than Quarters:
       4.9.1.1. Subscribers install and maintain new wiring for unofficial service consistent with
       their organizational policy and instruction.
       4.9.1.2. The subscriber must acquire authorization to install telephone equipment (see
       AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property), where non-Air
       Force-owned wiring exists in or on Air Force real property.
           4.9.1.2.1. The base CSO coordinates all such requests.
           4.9.1.2.2. Unless specifically approved, the authorization is a permit for DOD
           subscribers and a revocable license for non-DOD subscribers.
       4.9.1.3. Unless modified by the real estate document (e.g., lease, outgrant, etc.) or
       contract, the base CSO maintains all permanently installed building wiring that existed in
       the facility before occupancy by the subscriber.
   4.9.2. Non-Government-Owned Facilities on Air Force Property. These facilities include
   self-sustaining banks, credit unions on CONUS bases, and other commercial activities. The
   subscriber installs, repairs, and maintains all outlets and associated wiring.
   4.9.3. General Unofficial Commercial Telephone/Voice Service:
       4.9.3.1. The subscriber funds all costs.
   4.9.3.2. The base communications activity handles repairs when government-owned or -
   leased facilities or equipment are part of the circuitry.
4.10. Class of Telephone/Voice Service. Classes of official telephone service are:
   4.10.1. Class A. Telephone lines accessing central offices, toll trunks, government voice
   systems and services, and DSN. Class A service has four billing categories:
       4.10.1.1. Class A-1. Telephone lines for transacting official Air Force business.
       4.10.1.2. Class A-2. Telephone lines for transacting official business of other military
       services or other government agencies (except the United States Postal Service) that
       directly support the Air Force installation, other activities furnishing service to or
       supporting Air Force installations, quasi-governmental agencies such as the American
       Red Cross (ARC) or morale, welfare, recreation, and services (MWRS) activities.
       4.10.1.3. Class A-3. Telephone lines for transacting official business for any executive
       department, independent activity, or other government agency, except the Armed Forces,
       that is not supporting or servicing an Air Force installation.
       4.10.1.4. Class A-4.     Telephone lines for transacting official business in DOD
       commissaries.
   4.10.2. Class B (Unofficial Telephone Service). Telephone service provided by a DOD
   component when used for personal or unofficial purposes is known as Class B telephone
   service. This includes telephone services provided by government-owned or government-
   leased facilities, or procured under contract or implied agreement, with a commercial
   communications company. These services are made available primarily in overseas locations,
   but there is limited use also in the United States. When you obtain these services from the
AFMAN33-145 6 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                     17

   Armed Forces; General Military Law, Service, Supply, and Procurement; Real Property;
   Related Personal Property; And Lease Of Non-Excess Property; Utilities and services: sale;
   expansion and extension of systems and facilities; DOD criteria; and this instruction. Offer
   Class B service only when an installation cannot reasonably obtain commercial service for its
   unofficial needs. Class B subscribers can access commercial telephone central offices and
   toll trunks (except where restricted). Class B service does not have direct in-dial or out-dial
   access to DSN and other government private line services. Class B service has the following
   categories:
       4.10.2.1. Class B-1. Telephone lines in government-owned and government-leased
       quarters for family or personal use including telephone lines in unaccompanied personnel
       housing, visiting officers’ quarters, family housing, and hospital suites.

   lines to special services such as fire, sentry, and crash alarms. See AFI 32-2001, Fire
   Emergency Services Program, for information on operating fire-reporting telephones.
4.11. Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Instruction. Air Force organizations considering
VoIP tests or operational implementation are directed to submit an AF Form 1067 via TopVue
(https://wbgtac1p.hill.af.mil/topvue-afnic/index.aspx). An AF Form 1067 is needed to capture
VoIP capability that will be implemented at a base or for a MAJCOM if all bases within a
MAJCOM are implemented using the same architecture, equipment, etc. Supporting
documentation must be included identifying architectural changes to the voice system baseline,
list of equipment (model), and projected cost.
4.12. Enhanced 911 (e911). Per DoDI 6055.17, DoD Installation Emergency Management
(IEM) Program, e911 is defined as a telephone system consisting of network, database, and
enhanced 911 equipment that uses the single three-digit number ―911‖ for reporting police, fire,
medical, or other emergency situations to a central location, while automatically associating a
physical address with the calling party’s telephone number.
   4.12.1. AF installations will establish a single phone number to satisfy all A4/7 emergency
   response requirements (e.g. police, fire and medical) and ensure both Automatic Number
   Identification and Automatic Location Identification information is provided to the
   Emergency Communications Center (ECC).

  4.12.2. Air Force installations located within the Continental United States (CONUS) with a
  government-owned and operated emergency dispatch are required to have e911 services with
  recording capability.
     4.12.2.1. These CONUS installations are required to route all Emergency Service
     Number calls originating on the installation to the ECC.
     4.12.2.2. CONUS installations receiving e911 emergency response from State and Local
     authorities must codify the support for these services in a Memorandum of Agreement or
     Understanding with the service provider.
  4.12.3. Installations located Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) should provide
  ―e911-like‖ services on the installation or receive similar services through agreements with
  the host nation.
  4.12.4. Oversight for CONUS and OCONUS agreements, along with the operational use of
  e911, rests with the A4/7 community.
  4.12.5. Technical solutions leveraging VoIP must include the capability to support e911
  services. While current technology limits e911 services for cellular telephone users, future
  technical solutions must provide for this capability once the technology matures.

 CONDITIONS FOR OFFICIAL TELEPHONE SERVICE IN PERSONAL QUARTERS

A2.1. Commanders and limited key members of their staff whose positions require immediate
communications access in support of the exercise of Command and Control may be provided
official communications services in their personal quarters. This access will be strictly limited to
individuals in command positions, and those in staff positions, whose informed advice is critical
to supporting the commander. A written justification will be supplied to the CSO for each
qualifying individual. Justifications based on an individual’s rank or claim of convenience will
not be sufficient. Each request should be accompanied by a business case which clearly
demonstrates the calamitous security consequences which could result from failure to provide the
occupant with such communications support. If the request is approved, this documentation will
be maintained by the base CSO until such time as the occupant changes position or vacates the
quarters.
A2.2. Communications Support:
   A2.2.1. All communications support provided in accordance with paragraph A2.1 are to be
   used only for official purposes. The support can include, but is not limited to: direct lines
   with access to both the base telephone switch and commercial connectivity (Class A), DSN,
   data (NIPRNET/SIPRNET) and STE.                 Occupants who qualify for this funded
   communications support to their quarters are responsible for providing separate telephone
   service, at their own expense, for personal use (see paragraph A2.3.2 below).
   A2.2.2. Personnel not covered by Paragraph A2.1 are not authorized Class A telephone
   service that provides local off-base or commercial long distance telephone service. If
   justified, these personnel may receive official service with either direct lines to the base
   telephone switchboard or Class C Lines, and DSN access if mission essential.
A2.3. You may use multi-line instruments to terminate official and unofficial lines in approved
quarters.
   A2.3.1. The serving communications unit provides this service.
   A2.3.2. The occupant of the quarters bears any cost for the multi-line instrument that
   exceeds the cost of providing approved official service.
   A2.3.3. Use a government-owned instrument when it provides the lowest cost to the
   government.
   A2.3.4. In calculating lowest cost, consider the costs of reworking cable, removing and
   replacing instruments, purchasing instruments, etc., for current and future occupants.
