1.10. (AFWA) Unclassified Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO) produced by
personnel affiliated with AFWA or funded via AFWA managed contracts shall be submitted to
the AFWA STINFO Officer for review. STINFO review and release approval is required when
the STINFO will be accessible to entities outside of DoD. This includes STINFO presented at
civilian conferences/meetings/briefings or in civilian publications or electronic forums. STINFO
may include, but is not limited to, technical reports and papers, briefings, speech outlines and
slides, computer programs or documentation, or contractual documentation. STINFO may be in
written, spoken, film, or electronic format.
1.21. (AFWA) The AFWA FORM 14, Review of Scientific & Technical Information (STINFO)
(shown in Attachment 1) is used to document the approval phase of this process. In addition to
approval by the AFWA STINFO officer, STINFO proposed for public release must be approved
by the AFWA servicing Public Affairs office. Two weeks should be allocated for the approval
process.

1.21.1 (ADDED) The STINFO officer will use the AFWA FORM 14 to designate appropriate
distribution statements for AFWA produced STINFO. AFWA personnel shall distribute STINFO
only in accordance with its distribution statement and shall not distribute STINFO without an
approved distribution statement.
