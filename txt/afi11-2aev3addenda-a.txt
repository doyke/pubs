                                            Chapter 1

                                            POLICY

1.1. General. This instruction establishes basic cargo compartment configuration, standard
equipment, and location of such equipment aboard the C-130, C-17, KC-135, and C-21 aircraft.
Opportune aircraft systems, KC-10 and C-5 are identified. Some aircraft have additional
equipment installed that may affect configuring the aircraft as listed. The cargo compartment
limitations listed herein are the most typical encountered in day-to-day operations. The times
quoted are approximate figures and are configuration times only. They do not include de-
configuration times. Aeromedical Evacuation Crews (AEC) do not require parachutes. Mission
Design Series (MDS) specific survival equipment is for primary flight crewmembers only.
Instructions in this AFI are mandatory and provide the best possible operating instructions under
most circumstances, but cannot account for every possible situation that a crewmember may
encounter during contingency operations. During these times, the AEC must use sound judgment
and operational risk management to meet mission demands.
   1.1.1. Applicability. This AFI is applicable to all AE units/individuals involved with AE
   operations. It is a compilation of information from aircraft flight manuals, other Air Force
   directives, as well as an original source document for many areas. Basic source directives
   have precedence in the case of any conflicts, revisions, and matters of interpretation. For
   those areas where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority will be in accordance
   with paragraph 1.5.2 For those areas where this AFI repeats information contained in other
   source documents, waiver authority will be in accordance with source documents.
   1.1.2. This AFI provides necessarily broad guidance and cannot address every conceivable
   circumstance. Medical Crew Directors (MCD)/Charge Medical Technicians (CMT) are
   expected to use their best judgment to ensure the safe conduct of the flight.
1.2. Responsibility. Personnel engaged in planning operations must consider the most
appropriate configuration that satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount
of variations and man-hours to change. United States Air Force (USAF) units performing
services on the aircraft (i.e., Maintenance, Aerial Port, and Aircrew Flight Equipment) are
responsible for configuring the aircraft in accordance with (IAW) appropriate 11-2MDS V3
Addenda A instruction and as outlined in mission directives, to include the stowage/installation
of the equipment IAW the configuration and equipment tables outlined herein. The aircrew will
normally accomplish some configurations with assistance by maintenance personnel. Aircrew
personnel, during preflight, will ensure that required mission equipment has been provided and is
properly installed. When the aircraft configuration is not completed prior to aircrew show time,
the loadmaster (LM) or boom operator (BO) will assist in the completion of the configuration,
after accomplishing required predeparture duties (i.e., preflight, loading, etc.). Items that can be
corrected without maintenance assistance (i.e., seat belts, seat hooks, etc.) will be corrected by
the LM/BO. LM’s/BO’s have overall responsibility for configuration management and proper
installation of equipment on the aircraft.
1.3. Modifications. The configuration codes of this AFI may, if necessary, require
modifications for a specific mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to
mission operation to ensure maximum flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment.
Each mission directive will identify the basic configuration by code and the modification, if
 8                                                  AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011


necessary, to satisfy the mission requirement. For example, an AE mission may require more
litters than available in configuration AE-1. Consult the appropriate configuration charts to
determine at what location the desired additional litters can be installed and which seats must be
removed. Indicate in the mission directive, by position (left or right, and number) which seats are
to be deleted and (by alphabetical position) the litter tier provisions to be installed.
1.4. Distribution. See AFI 11-2AEV3, Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Operations Procedures,
Chapter 1 and apply the following: Maintain at least one copy of this instruction in each
squadron operations section (FCIF Library). The following agencies should have direct access
(latest electronic version) or paper copy: Staff operations, Aircrew Stan/Eval, Command
Posts/operations centers, Air freight management, Fleet Service, Aircraft Maintenance units,
alternate mission equipment sections, quality control, and Aircrew Flight Equipment sections,
one paper copy for each supplemental weight and balance handbook aboard each aircraft.
1.5. Deviations and Waivers.
     1.5.1. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI under normal
     circumstances, except:
        1.5.1.1. For safety.
        1.5.1.2. When necessary to protect the crew, patients, passengers (PAX) or aircraft from
        a situation not covered by this AFI and immediate action is required. The pilot in
        command (PIC) is the ultimate authority and responsible for the course-of-action to be
        taken. Report deviations or exceptions without waiver through channels to Major
        Command Office of Primary Responsibility (MAJCOM OPR).
     1.5.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is
     the MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority. Obtain waivers to deviate from
     provisions in this AFI via MAJCOM Stan/Eval. For missions under AMC/TACC operational
     control, direct all waiver requests directly to 618 TACC. EXCEPTION: Contingency
     missions. Waiver authority for contingency missions will be listed in the Operations Order
     (OPORD), Tasking Order (TO), etc., or is the Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR)
     (or equivalent) for the agency with Command and Control (C2) of the aircraft. Crewmembers
     may request additional information or confirmation from their home units, Tanker Airlift
     Control Center TACC, or MAJCOM/DO.
1.6. Revisions. Send comments and suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through channels to AMC/A3V, 402 Scott
Drive, Scott AFB IL., 62225-5302 IAW procedures in AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Procedures
and MAJCOM Supplement.
1.7. Supplements. Subordinate unit supplements to this instruction that change the basic
policies, procedures, or formats prescribed herein are prohibited.
1.8. AE Medical Equipment. AE equipment will be positioned as required by the Medical
Crew Director (MCD) based upon mission profile and patient requirements. Patient Therapeutic
Liquid Oxygen (PTLOX) will not be positioned adjacent to any hydraulic reservoir.
AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011                                                              9


                                           Chapter 2

                         AIRCREW FLIGHT EQUIPMENT (AFE)

2.1. Aircraft Flight Equipment (AFE) Configuration. AECs are required to utilize AFE to
accomplish the mission. Standard quantities of aircrew flight equipment are identified in this
instruction, MDS Specific 11-2MDS Vol 3, Addenda A. When an MDS specific Vol 3,
Addenda does not exist, refer to AFI 11-301, Vol 2, Maintenance and Configuration
Requirements for Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). MAJCOM’s may dictate other required
AFE. During AE contingency/deployment generations, it is imperative crewmembers deploy
with the full complement of AFE. This equipment must be at forward operating locations to
allow maximum mission flexibility when aircrews are away from home station. NOTE:
Demonstration of onboard Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) is required for all missions.
   2.1.1. AFE units, when supporting AE missions and aircrew, will build and maintain the
   equipment listed in Table 11 of AFI 11-301 Volume 2, Maintenance and Configuration
   Requirements for Mobility Air Forces (MAF) Aircrew and Aircraft Flight Equipment (AFE).
   The equipment will be placed in kits assigned to, and deployed with, an AE in-flight kit
   (UTC FFQDM). EXCEPTION: PACAF and USAFE AFE squadrons supporting AE
   operations will build and maintain eight kits. Individual MAJCOMs will direct what units
   will maintain for local training and operational missions.
   2.1.2. The AES will designate an individual to sign out the AECM Support Kit required to
   support daily operations. AFE will issue the AECM Support Kit to the AES POC via an AF
   Form 1297. In turn the AES POC will use an AF Form 1297 for controlling temporary issue
   to AECMs utilizing the equipment for operational or training missions. The AES POC will
   account for and return the issued AFE and MA-1 cylinders to AFE operations for
   maintenance, inspection, and shipment.
   2.1.3. AECMs are responsible for refilling and discharging the MA-1 oxygen issued by
   AFE. Prior to turn in of the cylinder, the cylinder pressure will be reduced to between 5 and
   38 PSIG gage pressure."
2.2. Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS):
   2.2.1. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection.
   2.2.2. The EPOS is a self-contained protective breathing device to provide oxygen during
   aircraft decompressions, when smoke or toxic fumes are present, and to aid in exiting oxygen
   deficient smoke filled cabins.
   2.2.3. The system consists of a hood, oxygen cylinder, carbon dioxide control, and neck seal.
   The hood incorporates multiple layers of Kapton and Teflon film providing heat and flame
   resistant to 1000°C (1832° F), ease of communication, tear resistance, and durability. The
   altitude restriction for the EPOS is FL 410 (41,000 feet).
   2.2.4. An anti-fog coating is applied to the inside of the hood.
   2.2.5. The EPOS contains one oxygen cylinder that contains 18 liters of aviator grade
   oxygen. Once activated, the oxygen cylinder dispenses oxygen for approximately 5 minutes.
   The sound of oxygen can be heard flowing into the hood. Once the oxygen cylinder has been
10                                                AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011


  depleted, the hood will begin to collapse. If the hood collapses to the point where it touches
  the wearer’s face, the wearer should be prepared to remove the EPOS. EPOS should also be
  removed when the individual has evacuated to a safe area, or is directed to do so by a
  qualified crewmember. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is controlled by panels of lithium hydroxide
  mounted around the inside bottom portion of the hood.
  2.2.6. Duration of Use:
     2.2.6.1. 5 minutes under moderate to heavy workload.
     2.2.6.2. 17 minutes of sedentary conditions followed by 3 minutes of moderate to heavy
     workload.
     2.2.6.3. Up to 60 minutes under sedentary conditions.
  2.2.7. The AE crew is responsible for ensuring that there are enough EPOS units for each
  AECM, patient, and attendant. On aircraft with the EPOS stored in a sealed container, a
  preflight/postflight is to ensure that there are enough units inside the sealed container. If the
  EPOS units are in open containers check the package seal, if the seal is broken, a preflight
  consists of checking the color of the litmus paper on the humidity indicator disk located in
  the barrier pouch and the expiration date. If the litmus paper is pink, the unit is not
  serviceable.
  2.2.8. For C-130 and KC-135 aircraft, ensure that there are EPOS units prepositioned at each
  patient/ passenger positions. If not, work with the LM/BO to place one at each station. Secure
  the EPOS on the upper seat support tube using the attached tie-down strap and quick release
  snap. Position the EPOS bag to the forward side of the passenger and between the seat back
  webbing to ensure rapid access.
  2.2.9. For KC-135 aircraft, three additional EPOS should always be positioned with one in
  the latrine, one in the cockpit, and one at the galley/galley area. Notify BO if they are not
  there.
  2.2.10. For aircraft with airline-type seating, EPOS will be placed in the seat pockets; assist
  the BO/LM with handing out the EPOS to patients/passengers to be stored in seat pouches.
  2.2.11. For C-17 aircraft, check for EPOS underneath each seat. Notify LM if they are
  missing.
  2.2.12. For litter patients, AECMs will secure the EPOS at the head of each litter.
  WARNING: During activation, grasp the body, large round end of cylinder. Failure to do
  so will restrict the metal tab from opening and activating the oxygen system. The EPOS will
  not function without the removal of the metal tab. If the red knob separates, grasp the
  lanyard to pull the metal tab off the cylinder and then proceed to use the EPOS as directed.
  Failure to activate the flow of oxygen will reduce the level of oxygen inside the hood and
  will result in suffocation and death. NOTE: Ensure hair, jewelry, shirt collars, etc are not
  caught between the neck seal and neck. Reduced effectiveness of the EPOS may occur,
  increasing the likelihood of injury.
  2.2.13. For KC-135 aircraft, all AECMs will have emergency 02 immediately available
  when moving about the cabin. NOTE: The EPOS is not an acceptable source of emergency
  oxygen while performing crew duties. AECMs will don the EPOS, cease all crew duties and
  be seated if there are no other oxygen sources available.
AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011                                                                11


2.3. Oxygen Mask.
   2.3.1. P/N 358-1506 series quick-don oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred
   smoke and fume protection for primary AECMs.
2.4. Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE)/Emergency Escape Breathing Device (EEBD).
   2.4.1. Units may utilize PBE/EEBD with the fire retardant polyethylene (green) storage
   container and neoprene neck seal. PBE/EEBD will remain in their original "hard" carrying
   case to provide fire and puncture-proof protection.
   2.4.2. This device is a 15 minute, self-contained, completely disposable breathing unit, with
   a solid state oxygen supply source. The universal size hood permits oral communication
   without compromising protection.
   2.4.3. AECM preflight consists of checking the color of the light blue litmus paper through
   the serviceability window in the side of the case. If the litmus paper has turned pink, the unit
   is no longer serviceable.
   2.4.4. Maximum operating altitude is FL 400 (40,000 feet).
   2.4.5. The containers are not to be opened unless an oxygen deficient, smoke-laden, or toxic
   atmosphere exists. WARNING: Improper use may cause injury or death. User must have
   adequate training to use. CAUTION: Ensure long hair or clothing is not caught in the neck
   seal.
2.5. Life Preserver Units (LPU):
   2.5.1. The adult/child (A/C) LPU is the preferred LPU for AECMs and patients/passengers
   during ditching situations. The A/C LPU does not require pre-fitting prior to flight and is
   easier to don during emergency situations. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU
   for each passenger during overwater flights. AECMs must notify BO/LM if there are not
   enough A/C LPUs for each patient/PAX/AECM. The A/C LPU can be used on children
   greater than 18 months old. The A/C LPU has the following components: Sea dye marker,
   lanyard, water activated light, oral inflation tube and whistle.
   2.5.2. The 10/P LPUs are required and designed to integrate with AFE. Adult/Child LPUs
   are not compatible for use with AFE and will not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.
   2.5.3. The life vests are inflated by pulling the red CO2 release tabs or orally by using the
   oral inflation tubes.
   2.5.4. LPU-6/P infant cot may be used for infants up to 18 months old. To use the LPU-6/P,
   place the infant feet first into the cot with head towards open end of hood. Secure the infant
   with restraining tape around the chest and across the upper thighs. For added protection, a
   baby blanket should be placed around or under the infant before placing the infant in the cot.
   The LPU-6/P has the following survival components: air ports, water activated light,
   lanyard, oral inflation tubes, and webbing straps. NOTE: The LPU-6/P is the only life
   preserver that can be inflated inside the aircraft.
2.6. Life Rafts.
   2.6.1. AECMs will coordinate with PIC, LM/BO to ensure life rafts are available.
2.7. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Missions.

  2.7.1. All AE aircrews flying on CRAF aircraft are exempt from having to use the AFE
  except for the 358-series quick-don mask and MA-1 walk-around bottle and EPOS. This
  equipment is required for protection from smoke and fumes and emergency decompressions.
  Travis and Charleston AFBs AFE shops will maintain twelve (12) and thirteen (13) kits
  respectively, containing seven (7) each LPU-6/P infant cot life preservers and eleven (11)
  each EPOS to support AE CRAF missions. These CRAF support kits will only be mobilized
  to support CRAF AE operations.

                            AIRCRAFT SUPPORT EQUIPMENT

3.1. PATIENT SUPPORT PALLET (PSP).
3.2. Description. The PSP increases the number of aircraft capable of performing patient
movement during steady-state operations, times of war and military operations other than war.
The PSP is intended for use on C-17, KC-10 and KC-135 cargo aircraft only. The PSP is
manufactured to defined standards and tolerances that allow interchangeability of parts. The PSP
has a protective finish on parts that are not inherently corrosion resistant and includes fastening
devices that stay in position during service use. The PSP pallet base occupies the footprint of a
463L aircraft pallet. Standard airline seat track rails embedded in the surface of the pallet base
provide mounting for the airline type seats and litter stanchions. Eight seat track rails are
mounted in the 108-inch direction of the pallet base. The seat track rails are spaced at 12.60-inch
and 20.75-inch intervals.
   3.2.1. The pallet surface is covered with a non-skid material and supports up to six airline-
   type seats that are removable, forward or aft facing, and are Technical Standard Order (TSO)
   C-39b certified. Each seat has a reclining backrest, a padded armrest, an in-arm bi-fold tray
   table, a lap safety belt, a break-over backrest, and removable cloth upholstery. Each pallet
   has one large red cross on the pallet to ease identification of the pallet from other 463L
   pallets.
3.3. Requirements. The PSP is designed to support steady-state theater operational
requirements as well as patient movement on opportune airlift without integral litter capability.
These requirements include contingencies, humanitarian relief operation (HUMRO), Homeland
Defense, war, peacetime, routine and emergent missions.
   3.3.1. Requirements are driven by the following factors: patients, aircraft, location factors to
   include; Air Mobility Support Squadrons and location of tanker aircraft.
3.4. AE Mission Execution. The Aerial Port Control Center (APCC) or the Air Mobility
Control Center (AMCC) will notify aerial ports of outbound/inbound mission and support
requirements. PSPs will be transported and loaded onto aircraft IAW mission requirements/load
plan.
   3.4.1. At en route locations, reconfiguration and/or removal of PSP components, resulting in
   a change in either litter or ambulatory carrying capacity is not authorized, unless coordinated
   with TACC/AE Cell.
3.5. Responsibilities.
   3.5.1. Aircrew.
       3.5.1.1. Review Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Special Instructions
       (SPINs) for mission changes/reconfigurations.
   3.5.2. AE Personnel.
       3.5.2.1. Coordinate with LM/BO for loading and securing the PSP onboard the aircraft.

      3.5.2.2. All crewmembers will establish egress routes and ensure access to emergency
      exits/equipment is not obstructed by the PSP.
   3.5.3. The LM/BO and AECM shall ensure that there is a reasonable degree of access to the
   rear of the aircraft, and that passengers and patients have ready access to emergency exits.
   Load aircraft in such a manner that allows for movement from the flight deck to the cargo for
   fire fighting.
      3.5.3.1. Configure seats/litters on the PSP as required to meet mission requirements.
      WARNING: Stanchion assembly and seat requires a two-person lift to prevent injury.
      3.5.3.2. AECMs will inspect each PSP before and after mission use.
          3.5.3.2.1. Damaged PSPs requiring major repair will be reported to the PSP
          custodian (identified at base of origin) and documented using AFTO IMT 244,
          Industrial/Support Equipment Record.
          3.5.3.2.2. Immediate malfunctions/concerns will be resolved using crew Operational
          Risk Management (ORM) principles.
          3.5.3.2.3. An AECM or designee will process paperwork DD Form 1149, Requisition
          and Invoice/Shipping Document and/or AFTO IMT 244. NOTE: The PSP custodian
          should complete this form at home station, after contacting AMC/A38R for fund cite
          information. The DD Form 1149 will travel with the AECMs and be given to the PSP
          custodian upon return to home station.
   3.5.4. Aerial Port.
      3.5.4.1. Deliver and retrieve PSPs to and from the aircraft. The PSP was designed to
      interface with the 463L pallet system. Load the PSP using same methodology as the 463L
      pallet.
      3.5.4.2. When it is anticipated that the PSP will leave and return to home station for a
      single mission, PSP custodian (or designee) with assistance from aerial port personnel,
      will remove/replace the rigid PSP storage cover as prescribed by local facility policy for
      aircraft configuration. AECMs are responsible for breaking down the PSP into the
      storage mode unless directed otherwise by APS personnel.
      3.5.4.3. PSPs will be manifested and moved as 999 cargo IAW PSP concept of
      operations (CONOPS).
   3.5.5. 618 TACC/AE Cell.
      3.5.5.1. Identifies configuration requirements in the Global Decision Support System
      (GDSS), and Special Instructions (SPINs) for mission changes/reconfigurations.
      3.5.5.2. Serve as conduit for information between AECMs, aerial port functions, and
      other operational agencies when applicable.
      3.5.5.3. When the PSP is tasked for a mission at other than home station; the PSP will be
      moved in the cargo configuration (all components configured on the pallet in the cargo
      configuration with the protective cover in place), unless coordinated with 618 TACC/AE
      Cell.
3.6. USAFE and PACAF Interface.
AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011                                                                   15


   3.6.1. PSPs in USAFE and PACAF will be managed by the AMC/Air Mobility Operations
   Group (AMOG) at en route locations as determined by AMC/A3OE.
   3.6.2. Theater AOC will request the use of the PSP through the AMC/AMOG. AMC/AMOG
   is the granting authority when the PSP is required for use on non-AMC aircraft.
   3.6.3. Command Relationships/Architecture. AMC will retain ownership of the PSPs to
   allow for centralized oversight/budgeting and availability for intertheater mission execution.
3.7. Configurations.
   3.7.1. The PSPs have been fielded in block increments. The Block 1 initial design supports
   three litter patients per litter tier. An extension added to the litter tower of the Block 2 design
   will support four litter patients per tier on the C-17.

Table 3.1. PSP CONFIGURATION WEIGHTS.




Table 3.2. PSP PART WEIGHTS.




   3.7.2. The PSP can be configured in four different configurations. (Refer to Figure 3.1.
   through Figure 3.4. for depiction of Block 1 initial design configurations).
   3.7.3. Configuration options follow:
      3.7.3.1. PSP-W: Two litter tiers along the outer aspect of the pallet supporting six to
      eight litter patients. To facilitate egress, PSP-W will be used if maximum numbers of
      twelve (12) PSP(s) are required.
      3.7.3.2. PSP-L: Two litter tiers down the center of the PSP with litter arms facing out
      supporting six to eight litter patients.
      3.7.3.3. PSP-M: Three PSP seats and one litter tier along the outer aspect of the pallet
      supporting up to three to four litter patients and three ambulatory patients. During an
      inflight medical emergency, seats can be removed and placed off to the side to increase
      working space. NOTE: Each seat weighs 65 LBS. Combinations of one to three seats
      may be carried on the PSP-M.
 16                                                 AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011


      3.7.3.4. PSP-S: Six PSP seats supporting up to six ambulatory patients, medical
      attendants or crewmembers. Each seat is rated to hold 260 LBS.
   3.7.4. When three patients are transported per litter tower, each litter position is rated to hold
   320 LBS. When four patients are transported per litter tower the bottom and second litter
   positions are rated to hold 320 LBS, third litter position is rated to hold 220 LBS and the top
   litter position is rated to hold 160 LBS. WARNING: Failure to adhere to above litter weight
   ratings could result in injury. WARNING: The LM/BO and AECM shall avoid (when
   possible) placing the PSP-L configuration directly in front of or behind a center aisle PSP
   configuration (PSP-M, S, W). The abrupt change from a side to a center aisle between two

   3.11.3. Seats may be completely removed to facilitate litter/equipment loading.
   3.11.4. Accomplish enplaning/deplaning of ambulatory/litter patients in the most
   expeditious, safe manner. Full consideration must be given to the availability of materiel
   handling equipment (MHE) and ground support personnel.
   3.11.5. The KC-135/KC-10/C-17 requires a roller system to roll the PSP on and off the
   aircraft. These roller systems reduce free walking space on the aircraft and present tripping
   hazards in many areas. WARNING: Every effort should be made not to enplane/deplane
   patients across rollers.
   3.11.6. PSP ramps, extensions, and spacers should be used when available to mitigate trip
   hazards created by uneven surfaces between the PSP(s) and/or the C-17 integral stanchions.
   Spacers are designed to cover the gap between two pallets. The PSP ramps and extensions
   attach either to the pallet or to each other to provide a smooth transition from the pallet to the
   aircraft floor. EXCEPTION: On the KC-10, location of aircraft seats may prevent use of
   PSP ramps immediately forward of the PSP to cover exposed rollers. In addition, PSP spacer
   does not fit between pallets in Configuration I. Ensure two of the five DZUS fasteners are in
   place and secured for proper ramp installation.
   3.11.7. Once secured in the roller system, secure PSPs with a cargo tie down strap to the
   roller system rails to prevent forward-aft pallet movement during flight. WARNING: Do
   not use seat track/stanchion fitting ring(s) to secure any equipment.
   3.11.8. The stanchion arms are designed for non-sequential enplaning/deplaning of
   individual litter patients.
3.12. Patient Care Procedures.
   3.12.1. The AECM should be cognizant of trip hazards (space between pallets, drop off on
   sides of pallet, and cargo rollers) and shall provide safety briefings to patients, passengers,
   attendants and litter bearers as needed.        NOTE: If patient requirements dictate and
   additional work space is needed, the PSP may be configured with only one litter tower. In
   addition, the second tower may be installed after the patient with increased care requirements
   is enplaned.     WARNING: The AECM shall instruct seated patients/attendants on the
   operation of the integral food tray. Improper handling of this tray may result in injury.
   WARNING: Never place a litter on the bottom litter tier without securing a litter above it.
   WARNING: The AECM shall be mindful of the potential strike hazard unoccupied
   cantilever arms present. To eliminate the hazard: Remove cantilever arms and store in a
   secure location on the aircraft, or place an empty litter in the next position. If a secure
   location is unavailable, cover empty cantilever arms with blankets and secure with litter
   straps.
3.13. Maintenance.
   3.13.1. Keep pallets clean to protect equipment, prevent the spread of contamination, and
   increase the serviceability of the unit.
   3.13.2. Cleaning of pallets shall be performed when necessary and cleaning shall be
   compatible with the type of material to be cleaned and the nature of the substance to be
   removed. In most cases, this should be mild soap and water.
   3.13.3. Keep seat track clear of any debris that will obstruct the lock engagement.
AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011                                                                  27


3.14. Disassembly and Storage. WARNING: When disassembling litter stanchions, one
person should support the weight of the stanchion as the second person unlocks and disengages
the stanchion from the seat track in the pallet floor. Failure to support the weight of the stanchion
could result in injury.
   3.14.1. The stanchion assembly is stored in the horizontal position and secured to the pallet
   to reduce the PSP system cubic volume during transport and storage.
3.15. KC-135 PSP CONFIGURATION.
   3.15.1. Ground Configuration.
       3.15.1.1. The PSP will be transported to the aircraft by aerial port personnel, positioned
       and secured on the aircraft by the BO, and configured by AE personnel.
       3.15.1.2. Exercise caution when maneuvering the pallet in and around the aircraft.
       3.15.1.3. The BO should open the aircraft 3 hours prior to take off to facilitate AECM
       aircraft configurations. The BO will coordinate with the MCD if the aircraft will not be
       opened 3 hours prior to takeoff.
       3.15.1.4. In cases when the KC-135 is configured at an en route stop, the MCD will
       coordinate with the PIC and BO, to determine when the aircraft should be configured for
       the next day’s mission. When possible, the aircraft should be configured the day prior to
       the mission, before entering crew rest.
       3.15.1.5. The MCD is ultimately responsible to ensure coordination between appropriate
       agencies has occurred or are in place to deliver PSP(s) to the aircraft. NOTE: Each PSP
       comes with only two seats. If three or six seat configuration is desired, procure one to
       four additional seats from another PSP set. Each seat has storage capacity for required
       prepositioned life support (EPOS and life preserver).
   3.15.2. Flight Configuration.
       3.15.2.1. PSP-W: Two litter tiers along the outer aspect of the pallet supporting up to
       three patients per tier.
       3.15.2.2. PSP-M: Three PSP seats and one litter tier along the outer aspect of the pallet
       supporting up to three litter and three ambulatory patients. During an inflight medical
       emergency, seats can be removed and placed off to the side to increase working space.
       NOTE: Each seat weighs 65 LBS. Combinations of one to three seats may be carried on
       the PSP-M.
       3.15.2.3. PSP-S: Six PSP seats supporting up to six ambulatory patients, medical
       attendants or crewmembers.
       3.15.2.4. Each litter position is rated to hold 320 lbs. Each seat is rated to hold 260 lbs.
       WARNING: On the KC-135, maximum PSP total load (PSP plus patients/equipment)
       will not exceed 2000 lbs. This includes the weight of the PSP. If weight is exceeded,
       supplemental restraint is required. Restrain PSP to 9 Gs forward. Use T.O. 1C-135-9
       when applying supplemental restraint.

      the pallets during unloading operations.
3.16. C-17 PSP CONFIGURATION.
   3.16.1. Use C3 configuration AFI 11-2C-17 Volume 3, Addenda A, C-17 Configuration and
   Mission Planning as reference for PSP loading. C3 configuration places pallets in the logistic
   rails side-by-side in the aircraft. Each side-by-side configuration is considered one pallet
   position. To follow are PSP pallet position specifics:
   3.16.2. Pallet position L1/R1 are not authorized for the PSP litter configurations, but can be
   used for the comfort pallet and/or 6-12 PSP seats. Seats should be used by flight crew,
   Critical Care Aeromedical Evacuation Transport Team (CCATT) and aeromedical crew
   members (AECMs). WARNING: PSPs will not be loaded in the ADS rails; sideways litter
   patient orientation is not authorized.
   3.16.3. PSP(s) can be placed in pallet positions L2/R2 to L6/R6, for a maximum of 12
   PSP(S). Pallet positions L2/R2 through L5/R5 can hold 6-8 patients per pallet. Pallet
   positions L6/R6 can hold up to three ambulatory and 3-4 litters per pallet. Total number of
   litters that can be carried is 54-72 litters. Maximum litter load is dependent on whether
   patients are loaded three or four high.
   3.16.4. Pallet position L7/R7 is only authorized for the PSP-S. For egress purposes, only the
   three seats on the inside track of the pallet will be used for patients, flight crew, CCATT
   and/or AECMs.
   3.16.5. Pallet positions L8/R8 and L9/R9 are not authorized for PSP use. Extra medical
   equipment and baggage may be tied down in this area.

   aircraft’s organic litter carrying capability. Although a mission may not require a full 36 litter
   positions, the LSAS is a kit and the full complement of components (in storage box) will be
   transported on the mission. This ensures that the equipment set is kept together for all stages
AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011                                                               31


  of employment and allows repositioning movement of the C-17 LSAS as designated by the
  airlift-tasking agency.
  3.20.3. Custodial Duties.
     3.20.3.1. Each C-17 LSAS will be considered a kit and an inventory will be included.
     The custodian will ensure that each C-17 LSAS is inventoried upon receipt, and
     before/after each mission.
     3.20.3.2. The custodian will prepare a DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping
     Document, provide it to the Charge Medical Technician for the AE mission, and include
     it with any LSAS being used for an AE mission. The DD Form 1149 is used by the
     AECM, Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Officer (AEOO), or AE ground support
     personnel to initiate return shipment of the LSAS when it’s left at a station other than the
     origination.
  3.20.4. LSAS Tasking. The airlift-tasking agency, Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC),
  USAFE/ PACAF Warfighting Headquarters (WFHQ), or Air Mobility Division
  (AMD)/Aeromedical Evacuation Control Team (AECT) is responsible for tasking the LSAS
  for use when required. If the LSAS is needed for an AE mission at a location other than
  where it is assigned, TACC, USAFE/PACAF WFHQ, or AECT will task and position the
  LSAS to the location required for the mission, using opportune airlift or the Traffic
  Management (TMO) system. The C-2 agency may consider tasking an AEOO to accompany
  the C-17 LSAS when it will terminate at a location other than point of origination. The C-2
  agency may also determine that a crew duty time/flight duty period waiver may be necessary
  to facilitate getting the LSAS properly processed through TMO for return shipment.
     3.20.4.1. When the LSAS is employed for an AE mission, care and management of the
     LSAS is transferred from the custodian to AE personnel until the time it is inserted into
     the TMO system for return shipment.
     3.20.4.2. LSAS Positioning. If an LSAS is required for an operational AE mission, the
     storage box will normally be loaded on the aircraft ramp in the aerial delivery system
     (ADS) rails IAW T.O. 1C-17A-9 (Position 10 or 11).
     3.20.4.3. If a full complement of litters is not required, the LSAS may be positioned in
     any ADS (Center Row) pallet position. This positioning is intended to maximize the C-17
     litter capacity and facilitates aircraft evacuation paths on both sides of the aircraft.
     3.20.4.4. The LSAS will not be positioned in the logistic rail system at any time during
     patient loading/offloading or during flights with patients on board the aircraft. This is to
     ensure adequate egress paths are maintained IAW T.O. 1C-17A-1.
     3.20.4.5. Should a LSAS storage box be transported as cargo with no patients on board
     the aircraft, the container may be positioned in any pallet position using either rail system
     IAW T.O. 1C-17A-9.
  3.20.5. Mission Execution. The MCD will develop a load plan based on patient
  requirements. The AE crew will receive the LSAS equipment at the aircraft from the LSAS
  custodial Ramp Services/Aerial Port Squadron (APS) personnel and inspect the LSAS for
  damage prior to use. The AE crew will configure the aircraft IAW the load plan using the
  aircraft's integral organic litter station components and those provided in the C-17 LSAS.
32                                               AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011


  3.20.6. Patient Loading/Offloading. The LSAS will remain onboard the aircraft during
  patient loading/offloading. EXCEPTION: In the rare event that a specific patient’s
  condition, equipment needs or size raises serious safety concerns, the LSAS box may be
  removed from the aircraft for increased clearance. The PIC with coordination between the
  MCD and LM is the final authority in determining if the LSAS should be removed to
  facilitate patient on/offloading. The MCD will request ground handling equipment, as
  required, on the off-load message. WARNING: During loading/off loading, pay attention
  to the elevated area around the edge of the LSAS. (This area could be a potential tripping
  hazard). Spotter(s) should be used to ensure litter bearers are aware of the hazard. When
  on/offloading patients of excessive weight or with excessive equipment requiring more than a
  four-person carry, extra caution should also be used.
  3.20.7. Mission termination. AECMs, Loadmasters, AEOOs, AE ground support and/or
  flight line personnel will deconfigure the LSAS as required for storage/shipping. AECMs
  will tag damaged components, which must be placed back in the LSAS storage box with
  AFTO Form 350, and also document the deficiency on the AFTO Form 244. If LSAS
  terminates at another location than its origin, the AECMS, AEOOs, AE ground support will
  ensure the LSAS DD Form 1149 is processed through the local TMO (as described in
  paragraph 5.6.2.2.) NOTE: AECMs will ensure that aircraft equipment affixed with unit
  identification remain with the aircraft. Mixing of specially identified aircraft equipment and
  LSAS parts is prohibited.
     3.20.7.1. The Medical Crew Director (MCD) will call the 24-hour contact AE cell at
     their airlift control agency to report on the mission. For PACAF/USAFE missions,
     WFHQ or AECT will phone patch-in TACC for mission termination report. This report
     will include information regarding disposition of the LSAS. Specifically, the MCD will
     report the on-load/off-load International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code of the
     LSAS, equipment identification number, Transportation Control Number (TCN) and
     describe damaged equipment which was tagged using AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item
     Processing Tag.
     3.20.7.2. At enroute locations, reconfiguration and/or removal of LSAS components is
     not authorized unless coordinated with TACC/XOPA.
  3.20.8. LSAS Tracking/Repositioning. In most cases, the LSAS will return to the originating
  location on the mission on which it was flown. If an AE mission terminates at a location
  other than origin, the LSAS will be processed through the TMO as cargo. It is necessary that
  AE crew, AEOO, and AE ground support personnel are familiar with the DD Form 1149 so
  they may process it and the LSAS kit at the mission termination TMO location.
     3.20.8.1. The AECM or AE ground support personnel will obtain a TCN from TMO and
     convey this information to the AE C2 during end of mission report.
     3.20.8.2. APS personnel unload aircraft and take cargo to the marshalling yard or TMO
     for processing. With APS assistance the AECM or AE ground support personnel will
     process the DD Form 1149 for shipment of the LSAS to the owning unit.
     3.20.8.3. The tasking agency will serve as a conduit for information between AECMs,
     aerial port functions, and other operational agencies when applicable.
  3.20.9. Maintenance.
AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011                                                             33


     3.20.9.1. Minor Repairs. At home station, the C-17 LSAS custodian will accomplish
     minor repairs if possible. Other than the utility panel, the LSAS components are stamped
     steel, and will not have a minor maintenance requirement.
     3.20.9.2. Major Repairs. At mission termination, the AE crews will coordinate with the
     Load-master to swap damaged LSAS components with functional components from the
     aircraft' s organic complement of three litter stations. This ensures that the C-17 LSASs
     are kept in fully mission ready status. However, the aircraft complement of litter stations
     should not be totally decimated; at least one fully functional litter station should remain
     on the aircraft. If broken litter station parts are swapped with the aircraft's organic
     complement of litter stations, the Loadmaster will annotate the defects on the AFTO
     Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, to ensure aircraft
     component repair.
     3.20.9.3. Spare Parts. The spare parts that will be contained in the C-17 LSAS are one
     pair of additional struts, one additional stanchion, and one additional utility panel. The
     custodian will ensure that spare parts are present in the storage box and functional.

5.1. Aircraft Systems.
   5.1.1. Oxygen.
       5.1.1.1. Therapeutic oxygen. A minimum quantity of 75 liters of LOX is required for
       scheduled aeromedical evacuation missions originating from staged/home station. At en
       route stops, the MCD in conjunction with the PIC will ensure the total LOX quantity is
       sufficient to meet all anticipated patient needs. EXCEPTION: For In System Select
       (ISS) aircraft or AE alert missions, the MCD in conjunction with the PIC will ensure the
       total LOX quantity is sufficient to complete the mission. The MCD will notify C2 of
       LOX quantity limitation. NOTE: Provisions must also be available for an emergency
       oxygen source if five ventilated patients will be transported.
       5.1.1.2. Patient emergency oxygen. Ambulatory and litter patients will utilize the
       passenger emergency oxygen system. NOTE: Floor-loaded patients or patients
       positioned on PSPs will be provided EPOS. NOTE: Backrest position could obstruct
       the oxygen panels and mask containers of patients placed in litter tier positions. Ensure a
       mask is accessible to each litter patient.
       5.1.1.3. Crew Oxygen. One 25L LOX bottle is used to supply emergency oxygen to
       pressure demand regulators and recharger hoses on the flight deck. Two 75L LOX bottles
       supply oxygen to pressure demand regulators, recharger hoses, passenger emergency
       oxygen, and patient therapeutic oxygen in the cargo compartment.
   5.1.2. Electrical.
       5.1.2.1. A primary 115V/60 Hz converter is installed on-board the C-17 which provides
       60 Hz electrical power to the six aeromedical electrical outlet panels. There are two 115
       VAC/60 Hz outlets on each panel.

6.2. Aircraft Systems.
   6.2.1. Oxygen.
       6.2.1.1. Therapeutic oxygen. Not available on the KC-135. Utilize the PTLOX, or
       compressed oxygen tanks as available.
       6.2.1.2. Patient emergency oxygen. Utilize EPOS.
       6.2.1.3. Crew Oxygen. Supplied via 12 gaseous oxygen bottles (6 primary/6 secondary)
       for demand regulators and recharger hoses.
   6.2.2. Electrical. The PSP does not have electrical provisions. Electrical power for 400 Hz
   medical equipment is provided by an approved KC-135, 400 Hz pigtail adaptor (P/N
   8564034-135) located in the Electrical Cord Assembly Set (ECAS). Electrical power for 60
   Hz medical equipment is provided by the portable Avionics or Unitron Frequency Converter
   using the Frequency Converter Adapter Adaptive Electrical Pigtail (P/N 8564034-140).
       6.2.2.1. The release of TCTO 1C-135-1806 provides three additional electrical outlets on
       the KC-135 R/T block 40 aircraft. Locations of the outlets are at station 445, 645, and
       745. Each outlet provides a 115 VAC 3-phase 400hz 45 amp. The three new outlets and
       the galley plug provide a total of 180 amps. For AE missions, utilization of the Avionics
       or Unitron Frequency Converter and/or KC-135 ECAS adapter(s) are authorized. Any or
       all of the outlets may be utilized on AE missions, however, do not exceed the 30 amp
       capability of the frequency converter at individual outlets. The CMT will calculate total
       equipment amperage prior to connecting equipment to the aircraft or Avionics/Unitron
       Frequency Converter.
52                                                AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011


     6.2.2.2. Coordinate with BO for galley disconnect and pulling of circuit breakers before
     connecting the pigtail adaptor to the aircraft (Table 6.10). When connecting the pigtail
     adaptor to the galley plugs, ensure both circuit breakers marked ―GALLEY PWR‖ and
     ―Station 445‖ are pulled. Home station maintenance group will lock out/tag all
     incompatible power receptacles and document on AFTO IMT 781A, Maintenance
     Discrepancy and work document.
     6.2.2.3. Use the following guidance when connecting/disconnecting the KC-135, 400 Hz
     pigtail adaptor (P/N 8564034-135) or KC-135 Avionics/Unitron Frequency Converter,
     Adaptive Electrical Pigtail (P/N 8564034-140):
         6.2.2.3.1. KC-135 R and T models have different labels for the circuit breakers to be
         pulled when connecting/disconnecting the AE pigtails. AECMs will request the BO to
         open/reset the appropriate circuit breakers when connecting/disconnecting the AE
         pigtail adaptor.
             6.2.2.3.1.1. The R and T models identify the three circuit breakers for the Galley
             Plug, as GALLEY POWER located on the Main Circuit Breaker Panel. BO will
             pull all three circuit breakers.
         6.2.2.3.2. Insert KC-135 pigtail adaptor (P/N 8564034-135) from AE ECAS into
         aircraft receptacle. If using the Avionics/Unitron Frequency Converter, connect the
         Adaptive Electrical Pigtail (P/N 8564034-140) securely to the Avionics Frequency
         Converters 25 ft Input Power Cable prior to securing to aircraft power receptacle.
         6.2.2.3.3. BO will reset circuit breakers.
         6.2.2.3.4. If using KC-135 pigtail adaptor (P/N 8564034-135), accomplish AC
         testing IAW AFI 10-2909, AE Equipment Standards. Once AC testing is
         accomplished, secure all ECAS connections with plastic tie-straps. Secure the portion
         of the ECAS cord closest to the pigtail to a non-moving aircraft part. NOTES: The
         Avionics/Unitron Frequency Converter does not require AC testing at or aft of the
         duplex outlets. Follow plastic tie-strap procedure in 6.6.2.3.4. for medical equipment
         plugs at the terminal end of the ECAS, AC electrical extension cord. Tie-straps
         should be 15 inches in length to adequately cover all circumferences.
             6.2.2.3.4.1. When using the Avionics/Unitron Frequency Converter, aircraft
             circuit breaker will not be pulled when adding or removing medical equipment.
             The frequency converter has built in circuit breakers associated with each duplex
             outlet that provides adequate protection when adding or removing medical
             equipment. When adding or removing medical equipment, turn off the
             corresponding duplex outlet. WARNING: The Airdyne 3500 Air Compressor is
             not approved for use on the KC-135.
  6.2.3. Temperature. The greatest challenge to ground operations during summer is potential
  high cabin temperatures. The KC-135 interior heats up very quickly and can place significant
  thermal stress on patients and crew.
     6.2.3.1. The KC-135 air conditioning system is not operated on the ground. AE crews
     will request ground air conditioning units when ambient air temperature is 84 degrees or
     greater.
AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011                                                                 53


      6.2.3.2. The PIC/MCD will request an air conditioning cart whenever patients/crew is on
      board and the ambient temperature may exceed a comfortable level.
      6.2.3.3. In extreme heat conditions, utilize air conditioning carts to cold soak the aircraft.
      Locate one each at the over wing hatch and one at the aft emergency escape hatch.
      6.2.3.4. Other alternatives are: schedule morning or evening departure/arrivals; open
      over wing exits to promote air circulation (hatches must be installed prior to engine start);
      and in extreme situations MCD may request the PIC to declare AIREVAC priority.
      NOTE: Follow guidance in 6.2.3.1. Use alternatives methods as interim or last resort.
          6.2.3.4.1. The PIC may request ―AIREVAC priority‖ for preferential ATC handling
          due to inadequate temperature control during preflight and taxi. AIREVAC priority
          will only be used for that portion of the flight requiring expedited handling. It is the
          PIC’s responsibility to use this option for bonafide medical situations that demand
          priority handling.
      6.2.3.5. In-flight the aircraft’s temperature can be regulated by the BO. Optimal patient
      locations are mid-cabin, mid-tier for a litter patient.
      6.2.3.6. The floor is very cold and the ceiling area is very warm. Ensure the bottom litter
      patients have blankets available.
   6.2.4. Lighting. KC-135 lighting consists of ceiling mounted incandescent lights and one
   positional light, located on (R) hand side, forward cabin (map light).
      6.2.4.1. Some KC-135 models have a second positional light, located on the (L) hand
      side, forward cabin.
      6.2.4.2. Positional lights are helpful to illuminate specific patients in the litter stanchion
      area.
      6.2.4.3. AECMs will bring supplemental lighting on board, as required.
      6.2.4.4. The entire crew and all patients and personnel aboard will exercise extreme
      caution when moving in the main cabin.
6.3. Miscellaneous Information.
   6.3.1. The Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC) should coordinate with the
   medical facility nutritional support centers to prepare specialty meals. Schedule meals to
   arrive to aircraft 1 ½ hours prior to departure.
      6.3.1.1. The appropriate mission support agency (detachment, squadron etc) should make
      arrangements with Fleets Service to obtain coolers for meal storage. Box lunches may be
      broken down, storing only sandwiches and cold drinks in the coolers, to maximize cooler
      storage space.
   6.3.2. Hygiene. Latrine capacity is limited. This should be taken into consideration for
   planning procedures. The aircraft will depart home station with an operable latrine, a
   minimum of two urine tubes and two latrine cartridges.
      6.3.2.1. The CMT will verify the latrine knife blade handle is in the open/out position
      and that the latrine is fully functional when uploading the PSP. Patients and attendants
      should be encouraged to use available restroom facilities prior to enplaning the aircraft.

       6.3.2.2. Normal soap/water hand washing is not readily available on the KC-135. In-
       flight kit allowance standards follow infection control guidance and provide chemical
       hand cleaner. Chemical wipes may also be used.
       6.3.2.3. Ensure chemical hand cleaners are readily available for patient use.
6.4. Egress Considerations.
   6.4.1. Consistent with all AE missions, pre-mission planning includes an egress plan
   coordinated with the BO and communicated with the entire crew.
   6.4.2. The two primary egress points are the aft emergency escape hatch and the crew entry
   chute. The aft escape hatch is equipped with a slide; the crew entry chute is equipped with a
   ladder typically stored in the cargo compartment.
   6.4.3. The over-wing hatches are also available as emergency exits.
   6.4.4. The BO is the authority for egress of cargo compartment.
   6.4.5. When more than one BO is on-board, a BO will be in the cargo compartment during
   critical phases of flight.
   6.4.6. Life rafts will be located near the overwing hatches and at the aft emergency escape
   hatch. When tied down appropriately, the life rafts should not protrude into the egress path.
   6.4.7. Do not use Material Handling Equipment (MHE) or Patient Loading System (PLS)
   during ground evacuations as they may interfere with Crash Fire Rescue (CFR).

AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011                                                                   69


          7.1.6.9.1. With palms flat and thumbs out, raise the leg assembly out of the ground
          support plate.
          7.1.6.9.2. Fold the loading ramp keeping palms flat and thumbs out. When fully
          folded, remove the mounting yoke from the modular base. Stow the loading ramp for
          flight.
7.2. Loading Instructions for Neonatal Transport System (NTS) onto SPECTRUM Unit.
   7.2.1. Ensure all loading crewmembers, including pilot, are briefed and fully understand
   loading procedures and individual responsibilities.
   7.2.2. Ensure NTS is sled unit type and is strapped in place, on a support gurney. NOTE:
   To allow for NTS space needed, the Overhead Pneumatic Console may need to be removed.
   7.2.3. Loading requires five individuals: one aircrew member (pilot) inside the aircraft to
   guide the unit, and four individuals on the outside of the aircraft to slowly slide the unit up
   the ramp. The aircraft will be prepared with the SPECTRUM-specific loading ramp placed
   into the appropriate location with the bolt in front of the ramp inserted into the hole at the
   head of the SPECTRUM base unit. Ensure the ramp is angled such that it does not touch the
   sides of the doorway, and does not contact the toilet in front of the SPECTRUM unit.
   7.2.4. If available, the triangular ramp extension should be secured to the SPECTRUM unit
   and the ramp, extending toward the seat directly across from the SPECTRUM unit. Remove
   seat cushions from the forward left passenger seat.
   7.2.5. The legs of the ramp must be placed into the steel support stand. The ramp should be
   in the high position (the height is adjustable), such that it is similar in height to the gurney at
   full-up position. The gurney is wheeled into place, with the monitors of the NTS facing
   toward the rear of the aircraft (the rubber wheel will be at the front left when the gurney is
   pulled up to the ramp).
   7.2.6. Release the support straps of the sled to the gurney.
   7.2.7. The four crewmembers on the outside of the aircraft will slowly advance the sled up
   the ramp. The gurney may be pulled away when the sled is completely on the ramp. The two
   crewmembers closest to the cabin door will exercise caution not to damage the doorframe
   and left, forward seat armrest when loading. The flight crewmember on-board must be
   obeyed for changes in loading tempo to prevent damage to aircraft inside far wall.
   7.2.8. Once stabilized on the ramp, the aft left crewmember on the outside of the aircraft will
   follow the aft end of the NTS into the aircraft to help guide the unit in and lock the unit into
   the base.
   7.2.9. The flight crewmember inside the aircraft will ensure that the sled angles onto the
   base unit as it advances.
   7.2.10. The remaining outside crewmember and the crewmember, which followed the NTS
   into the aircraft, will remove the ramp and supplement lateral support after the NTS sled is
   secured to the base unit by the spring-loaded metal plate mechanism on each end.
   7.2.11. Insert the power cord into the spectrum power outlet.
 70                                                 AFI11-2AEV3ADDENDA-A 17 MAY 2011


   7.2.12. If a patient is in the NTS, open the base unit oxygen tanks (located under the rear end
   of the base unit). Plug the oxygen and air intake hoses of the NTS into the appropriate access
   ports on the spectrum base.
   7.2.13. When cleared by the PIC, turn the spectrum base power on. Check the NTS to ensure
   the AC power source is recognized.
   7.2.14. After all personnel are on-board, load the ramp and lateral stabilizer supplement up
   and place on board.
   7.2.15. For NTS deplaning, reverse the steps above.
7.3. Additional C-21 Configuration (AE-2 Configuration {1 Stretcher}) IAW TO-1C-21A-
1.
   7.3.1. Electrical and oxygen resources are very limited in this configuration.
   7.3.2. Maintenance should install stretcher on left side of the aircraft. (Right side installation
   is labor intensive and thus not practical for this use.)
   7.3.3. Ambulatory only, low-risk patients who require minimal nursing care are good
   candidates for transport. Patients will be able to ambulate on and off the aircraft without
   assistance. NOTE: Stretcher serves as emergency get-down litter only.
   7.3.4. Maximum ambulatory/attendant seats available are two due to space limitations
   required for medical equipment, baggage and AECMs.                NOTE: PMRC will consult
   validating theater flight surgeon to establish low-risk patient parameters.
7.4. Aircraft Systems.
   7.4.1. Oxygen.
       7.4.1.1. Therapeutic oxygen. Available if SPECTRUM unit is in place. If SPECTRUM
       unit is not in place, utilize PTLOX or compressed oxygen tanks as available.
       7.4.1.2. Patient emergency oxygen. Utilize aircraft passenger emergency oxygen system
       or pre-positioned emergency passenger oxygen system (EPOS).
       7.4.1.3. Crew Oxygen. Supplied via 1 high pressure oxygen storage cylinder for demand
       regulators located on the flight deck. C-21 aircraft normally have two Protective
       Breathing Equipment (PBE) and eight EPOS permanently pre-positioned on the aircraft.
       The PBE or EPOS can be used as a primary oxygen source for AECMs on the C-21.
   7.4.2. Electrical. 28 VDC for power to the spectrum. Equipment will operate on battery
   power if SPECTRUM unit is not in place.

8.1. C-130 Floor Loading.
   8.1.1. Floor-loading procedures for loading patients are authorized for all contingency
   operations when a time critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced
   with enemy siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is
   essential. Floor-loading procedures can be practiced and trained during Aeromedical
   Readiness Missions (ARM), joint training operations, exercises, etc. The cargo area floor will
   be configured with all rollers stowed.
   8.1.2. Ambulatory Patients: If available, any cushioning material may be used for seating, to
   prevent the patient from having to sit on the bare cargo area floor. Seat ambulatory patients
   so they face forward in the aircraft. Attach a cargo tie-down strap for each row of patients, in
   a manner that it will provide forward restraint and body stability. See T.O. 1C-130X-9A for
   proper use of the tie-down device.
   8.1.3. Litter Patients: Two crewmembers are required to work simultaneously in securing the
   opposite sides of the litters to the floor (applies when securing two or three litters together).
   Position litters side-by-side and longitudinally on the cargo area floor, with the patient’s head
   toward the aft of the aircraft. A total of 15 litter patients can be floor-loaded on the C-130.
   This is comprised of 5 rows of three litters. Medical equipment can be secured on a litter(s)
   in the ―I‖ or ―L‖ sidewall litter tier or on the ramp. Secure the litters to the aircraft floor using
   the following procedures. (See Figures 8.1 – 8.3) NOTE: Maximum altitude for floor-
   loaded patients is flight level 350 (FL350). NOTE: An additional two pallet positions are
   available on the C-130J-30 model that can accommodate an additional 6 litter patients.
       8.1.3.1. One litter: Use one tie-down device at each end of the litter. Center litter over
       tie down ring column ―D‖. Connect hook end of device to tie down ring column ―C‖,
       and run strap webbing over the litter handles, wrapping once around each handle. Attach
       the ratchet end of the tie-down device to tie down ring column ―E‖. Remove slack from
       strap webbing, and ratchet the device. Repeat process at other end of litter. Ensure
       ratchets have a minimum of 1½ turns of webbing around the spindle.
