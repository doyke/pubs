SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Significant
revisions include: re-naming the AFI to correctly align its name with its content; incorporating
guidance issued under Guidance Memoranda 1, 2, and 3 to the 17 June 2009 version of AFI 90-
201; a chapter outlining commanders’ responsibility to inspect; a chapter dedicated to Inspector
General force development & management; incorporating changes to nuclear inspection policy;
clarification of policy regarding the management and use of Headquarters Air Force (HAF)
checklists; clarification of deficiency tracking requirements; Gatekeeper policy; and inclusion of
numerous attachments to assist inspectors. This document provides guidance that will transition
the Air Force Inspection System (AFIS) from one steeped in Cold War philosophy to an AFIS
that emphasizes command responsibility, decreases the number of days on a wing’s calendar
impacted by external inspections, and provides greater visibility over programs and processes
executed at the wing level, while effectively meeting the challenges of increasing efficiencies
and decreasing resources. At the end of some chapters, a few statements regarding the future
state of inspections will help Airmen understand where the AFIS is headed and enable smart,
decentralized decisions to move closer toward the objective of a substantially improved
inspection system.

                                            Chapter 1

                     GENERAL GUIDANCE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Applicability. Unless otherwise stated, this Instruction applies to all inspections, as defined
in paragraph 1.2.2, conducted on or by any United States Air Force (USAF) organization,
including those forces assigned/apportioned to Combatant Commands.
1.2. Overview.
     1.2.1. The Air Force Inspection System. The Air Force Inspection System (AFIS) is an
     integrated, synchronized system of inspections conducted on behalf of the Secretary of the
     Air Force (SECAF), the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) and commanders at all
     levels.
        1.2.1.1. Inspection is an inherent function of command exercised at every level to
        evaluate readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline. Inspection preparation,
        if not directly aligned with mission readiness, is inherently wasteful. Units will be
        inspection ready when commanders focus on mission readiness and on building a culture
        of disciplined compliance in which every Airman does his/her job right the first time
        when no one’s looking. The intent of the Inspector General is to continuously improve
        the AFIS so there is an ever-shrinking difference—both real and perceived—between
        mission readiness and inspection readiness.
     1.2.2. Inspection. An inspection is any effort to evaluate an organization, function or
     process by any means or method, including surveys, interviews, assessments, performance
     evaluations and those audits not conducted under the authority of the Air Force Audit
     Agency (AFAA). Inspections include special visits, technical inspections, special one-time
     inspections, inspections required by law or for the exercise of command responsibilities, and
     inspections conducted by functional staff (Functional) entities to provide or obtain technical
     information or assistance.
        1.2.2.1. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), The Auditor General (TAG) and The
        Inspector General (TIG) have statutory authority and responsibility to conduct
        inspections and audits, which must guarantee independence, instill confidence in the
        system, and be free of an appearance of undue influence. TJAG, TAG, TIG and their
        authorized representatives must coordinate their inspections and audits with the
        appropriate Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers do not have the authority to approve/disapprove
        Article 6 inspections (TJAG), AFAA audits (TAG) nor AFIA and SAF/IGI inspections
        (TIG-directed); however, Gatekeepers have the most comprehensive view of unit
        activities and can facilitate optimum scheduling. The inspection requirements, policies,
        and procedures for Article 6 Inspections will be determined by TJAG.
     1.2.3. Inspections are the responsibility of commanders at all levels IAW Title 10 United
     States Code (USC) Section 8583, Requirement of Exemplary Conduct. Inspections are
     conducted by a commander, or on behalf of a commander, on their staff and subordinate
     units/organizations. Inspections are performed by authorities inside the inspected unit (i.e.,
     Internal Inspections) and outside the inspected unit (i.e., External Inspections).
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                           9


   1.2.4. When differences arise concerning inspections governed by this Instruction
   (prioritized requirements, duplicative inspections, frequency, scope, etc.), this publication
   will take precedence in these matters over other Air Force policy and guidance.
1.3. Purpose of the AFIS. The purpose of the AFIS is threefold:
   1.3.1. To enable and strengthen commanders’ effectiveness and efficiency.
   1.3.2. To motivate and promote military discipline, improved unit performance, and
   management excellence up and down the chain of command, in units and staffs.
   1.3.3. To identify issues interfering with effectiveness, efficiency, compliance, discipline,
   readiness, performance, surety and management excellence.
1.4. Objectives of the AFIS.
   1.4.1. The AFIS is focused on assessing and reporting a unit’s readiness, economy,
   efficiency, and state of discipline to execute assigned missions. The AFIS gives SECAF,
   CSAF and commanders at all levels an independent assessment of:
       1.4.1.1. Unit compliance with established directives and ability to execute its assigned
       mission, leadership effectiveness, management performance, and aspects of unit culture
       and command climate (e.g., military discipline, respect, efficiency, safety, Wingman
       concept).
       1.4.1.2. A unit’s ability to find, analyze, report and fix deficiencies.
       1.4.1.3. A unit’s ability to prevent Fraud and minimize Waste and Abuse.
   1.4.2. The AFIS gives MAJCOM, National Guard Bureau (NGB) and HAF Functionals an
   independent assessment of functional effectiveness and compliance in the field, and of the
   adequacy of organization, policy, guidance, training and resources.
   1.4.3. The AFIS provides a mechanism for senior AF leaders to direct a targeted, more
   detailed and thorough inspection of specific programs, organizations, or issues.
   1.4.4. The AFIS can provide the instrument for units/organizations to receive required
   functional certifications.
1.5. Roles and Responsibilities.

       1.5.1.1. The Inspector General’s (TIG) mission is defined in HAF MD 1-20, The

       and establishing objectives for inspection programs through appropriate commanders;
       coordinating efforts to eliminate duplication and unnecessary inspections imposed on

       review by TIG for adherence to the objectives and policies contained in this Instruction.
       1.5.1.2. Has the authority to coordinate, synchronize, integrate, and approve/disapprove

                                           Chapter 2

         THE AIR FORCE INSPECTION SYSTEM—PROGRAM GUIDELINES

2.1. Definition of “Unit”. For the purposes of this Instruction, a “unit” is defined as a wing or
wing-equivalent organization. MAJCOMs will determine inspection requirements for other
organizations in the command. Refer to Chapter 7 for FOA/DRU inspection requirements.
2.1. (AFISRA) Definition of “Unit. ” For the purposes of this Instruction, a “unit” is defined
as a wing, center or group. Because of geographical separation or special mission requirements,
AFISRA/IG may inspect individual units below the Wing/Group level (e.g.,
squadron/detachment) as warranted.
2.2. Inspections. Inspections are planned, coordinated and conducted to ensure units and
subordinate organizations are properly organized, trained, equipped and supported to achieve
their required capabilities and execute their assigned missions. Inspections include a broad range
of activities designed to evaluate mission readiness, economy of resources, unit efficiency and
state of discipline. Inspection results also help commanders identify systemic problems and
improve quality of life for Airmen and their families.
   2.2.1. Internal Inspections. Internal Inspections are the foundation of the AFIS, promoting
   responsibility and accountability within the unit and allowing commanders to control the
   depth, scope and frequency of inspections.
   2.2.2. External Inspections. External inspections ensure the AFIS provides an independent,
   transparent and accountable assessment of readiness, economy, efficiency and state of
   discipline. Additionally, external inspections validate and verify internal inspections.
       2.2.2.1. External inspections include:
           2.2.2.1.1. MAJCOM/IG Inspections.
           2.2.2.1.2. Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). SAVs help a unit better understand the
           intent of higher headquarters policy and gives Functional staffs an opportunity to
           provide training to the unit. SAVs help MAJCOMs and HAF Functional staffs
           identify potential resource constraints and develop accurate guidance/policy. SAVs
           are conducted by MAJCOM or HAF Functional staffs and only at the request of the
           unit commander. All SAVs will be coordinated with the MAJCOM Gatekeeper.
           SAVs will not be given a rating and will not be used as a tool to prepare a unit for a
           formal IG inspection. SAVs will not be mandated by AFI.
           2.2.2.1.3. Other Approved Functional/Staff Assessments listed in Attachment 2 of
           this Instruction.
2.3. Commanders’ Duty to Inspect. IAW 10 USC § 8583, commanders will conduct Internal
Inspections and actively support and participate in External Inspections affecting their unit(s).
Refer to Chapter 6 for further guidance.
2.4. Inspector General Authority. SAF/IG and its subordinate inspectors (to include AFIA,
MAJCOM IG and Wing IG) derive their authority from The Inspector General's statutory and
regulatory authority.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                          19


  2.4.1. Inspector Certification. All IG inspectors (to include inspector augmentees) will be
  properly trained (see Chapter 8), certified in writing and sworn-in by oath (See Attachment
  5). The MAJCOM/IG will certify that all inspectors, to include inspector augmentees,
  assigned to an inspection team have completed appropriate AF and MAJCOMspecific
  inspector training. Inspector certification requires completion of prerequisite and mandatory
  training, as well as field observation. Field observation requirement is a minimum of one
  over-the-shoulder inspection by a certified inspector.
     2.4.1.1. MAJCOM/IGs can delegate to inspection Team Chiefs the authority to certify
     inspector augmentees on an interim basis for one month. MAJCOM/IGs will review
     Team Chief interim certifications and approve/disapprove full certification based on
     completion of requirements and the Team Chief’s recommendation.
     2.4.1.2. All certifications—interim and full—will be documented and filed IAW the AF
     Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS. Until the inspector is certified, the inspector
     must perform their inspection duties under the direct supervision of a certified inspector.
     Assigned IG inspectors must be certified within 6 months of being assigned to the IG.
     2.4.1.3. Non-nuclear MAJCOM inspectors are required to complete the AF Basic
     Inspector Course (BIC) and a field observation of either a Phase 0 Compliance Inspection
     or a Phase 1 & 2 Readiness Inspection.
     2.4.1.4. Nuclear MAJCOM, AFIA and Wing IG inspectors, in addition to the
     requirements in paragraph 2.4.1.3, will also complete the AF Nuclear Surety Inspector
     Course if their duties involve inspection of a nuclear surety mission. An over the
     shoulder Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI) or Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspection
     (NORI) satisfies the Phase 0 or 1 & 2 requirement.
     2.4.1.5. Wing Inspector General. Wing IGs will receive training IAW paragraph 8.4.2.
     and be certified by their wing commander. Wing IGs will certify that all inspectors
     assigned to the wing’s inspection team have completed appropriate AF and
     MAJCOMspecific inspector training.
  2.4.2. IG Oath. Officers, NCOs, and DAF civilians serving as inspectors will take the IG
  oath. The oath reminds all IG personnel of the special trust and confidence inherent in their
  positions, and of the need for impartial, independent evaluation on behalf of the commander.
     2.4.2.1. Administering the Oath. The commander, as the directing authority, should
     administer the oath to the command IG (at a minimum) and every IG serving in the IG
     staff section, preferably in a public forum where a significant portion of the command
     may witness it. If the commander is unable to administer the oath to all IGs in the staff
     section, the command IG will administer it instead. Assigned IGs will administer the
     oath to IG inspector augmentees. Contractor personnel working in an IG staff section
     will not take the IG oath.
     2.4.2.2. Re-administering the Oath. When a commander departs the command, the
     command IG may choose to execute another IG oath with the incoming commander as a
     way to express to that new commander the special relationship shared by both
     individuals. However, a new oath is not required. If an IG moves to an IG staff section in
     another command, the IG will execute a new oath with his or her new commander. All
20                                                AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


     individuals with prior IG experience who are nominated for a second, nonconsecutive IG
     detail must execute the IG oath upon arriving at his or her new command.
  2.4.3. Valid Period of Inspector Authority. An inspector’s authority is valid only for the
  period of time he/she is a certified inspector and performing official inspection activities.
  2.4.4. Use of Contractors as IG inspectors. Contractors are prohibited from acting in the
  capacity of an IG inspector since IG duties are an inherently governmental function per the
  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and IAW the Federal Activities
  Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998. However, contractors may participate in an
  inspection as subject-matter experts (SME) gathering information for, or providing advice,
  opinions, recommendations or ideas to a government member of the IG. While contractors
  can act as “sensors” providing information to the IG, the IG must make all decisions related
  to the inspection, including schedule, sample selection, deficiency assignment, deficiency
  severity, major graded areas (MGA) grades and overall ratings. Use of contractors must be
  in compliance with DOD Instruction 1100.22, Guidance for Determining Workforce Mix.
  2.4.5. Access to Information and Spaces. To carry out their responsibilities, Air Force IGs
  shall have expeditious and unrestricted access to and, when required, be given copies of all
  records, reports, investigations, audits, reviews, documents, papers, recommendations, or
  other material available to or within any USAF activity. While performing official duties as
  an inspector, IGs will be granted access to any and all documents, records, and evidentiary
  materials needed to discharge their duties, to include data stored in electronic repositories.
  Some examples are classified documents, records of board proceedings, acquisition
  information, medical records, medical quality assurance records, drug and alcohol records,
  financial records, evaluation reports, back-channel messages, security dossiers, criminal
  investigation reports (as permitted by law and applicable regulations), and financial
  disclosure statements. This authority includes direct access to pertinent extracts as allowed
  by applicable regulations.
  2.4.6. Access to medical records. When accessing medical records, IGs must remain aware
  that health care information is sensitive medical information, is protected by Public Law
  104–191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and must be
  protected. Accordingly, IGs must comply with all HIPAA release forms or requests and
  maintain the information in a safe, secure, and confidential manner.
  2.4.7. Restricted access. IGs are not authorized access to material subject to the attorney
  client privileged or other legal privileged information involving DoD personnel individually
  represented by legal counsel, such as by an Area Defense Counsel or legal assistance
  attorney. However, any such privilege can be waived by the represented individual.
  2.4.8. Access to classified or sensitive information. As part of an inspection, investigation or
  other directed inquiry, assigned IGs have a "need to know" and will forward a visit request
  through the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) to the security management office
  (SMO) determined by the unit, for further distribution throughout the unit. Access to
  classified information will be IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
  If compartmentalization or classification restrictions preclude immediate access to
  information required by an IG, the denying commander will immediately report the situation
  to the appropriate access-control authority and obtain an access-eligibility determination. If
  this authority does not grant access to the information, the IG will notify the commander and
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                           21


   SAF/IGI of the situation. The notice to SAF/IGI will include the location, date, and
   command; scope of the assistance inquiry, inspection, or investigation; who denied access;
   who verified denial and approved denial; and the reason access was denied.
   2.4.9. Special Access Programs. The Air Force Inspector General (SAF/IG) is responsible
   for performing program security, inspection, investigation and counterintelligence functions
   for all AF SAPs and for maintaining a sufficient cadre of inspectors, investigators, special
   agents, analysts and program security officers (PSOs) to do so. Through AFOSI, SAF/IG will
   appoint a SAP Security Director to execute SAP security and security oversight
   responsibilities, under the authority of the Air Force SAP Central Office (SAPCO), for all
   Air Force SAPs and non-AF SAPs where the AF has been assigned responsibility. The
   SAF/IG or a designated representative may attend any Special Access Required Programs
   Oversight Committee (SPOC), Special Programs Review Group (SPRG) and SAP Oversight
   Review Board (SORB) meeting. SAF/IG may propose an inspection, assessment or
   management review of a SAP or SAP function to the Secretary of the Air Force after
   obtaining the views of SAF/AA. SECAF approval of a proposed SAF/IG inspection,
   assessment or management review establishes SAP access “need to know” for the SAF/IG
   assigned and credentialed personnel required to accomplish such inspection, assessment or
   management review activities. In addition to the “need to know”, these credentialed
   personnel must meet the SAP access eligibility requirements outlined in AFI 16-701, Special
   Access Programs as do individuals who conduct SAF/IG investigations (SAF/IG
   investigations establish their own “need to know”). Unless the Secretary directs otherwise,
   all SAF/IG inspections, assessments or management reviews of a SAP or SAP activity will
   be coordinated with the Director, SAF/AAZ.
   2.4.9. (AFISRA) Special Access Programs (SAP). The AFISRA/IG will ensure that SAPs
   are inspected by appropriately cleared personnel.
   2.4.10. Access Control and Routine Searches. Inspector General personnel properly
   identifying themselves as representatives of the IG and properly identified on a signed,
   authenticated IG Entry Authority List (EAL) shall be authorized entry to Protection Level
   resources via established entry procedures identified in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense
   (FOUO) and DODS 5210-41-M, Volumes 1-3_AFMAN 31-108, The Air Force Nuclear
   Weapon Security Manual.
2.5. AF Inspection Requirements. MAJCOM/IGs will use Attachment 3 as an authoritative
source of HAF-level inspection requirements and will tailor inspection sampling strategies for
each inspected unit from the requirements listed in Attachment 3. Sampling from Attachment
3 adds a critical no-notice component to the AFIS. MAJCOM/IGs will not divulge the intended
inspection sample to the unit prior to the inspection inbrief. HAF Directorates will periodically
review and update applicable inspection requirements in Attachment 3 through SAF/IGI for
coordination/approval via the Inspection System Governance Process (see paragraph 2.18.).
2.6. Inspection Frequency.
   2.6.1. Air Force policy is that commanders at wing level and below should receive at least
   one major IG inspection during their command tour.
   2.6.2. Active Duty Units. CUI Phase 0, 1 and 2 requirements must be completed within 48
   months, while striving to complete these requirements within 24 months.
 22                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   2.6.2. (AFISRA) AFISRA/IG inspection frequency will be 24 months for all AFISRA AD
   units.
   2.6.3. Classic-Associate TFI Units.
       2.6.3.1. Active Duty Unit in the Classic Association.    CUI Phase 0, 1 and 2
       requirements must be completed within 48 months, while striving to complete these
       requirements within 24 months.
       2.6.3.2. ARC Unit in the Classic Association. CUI Phase 0, 1 and 2 requirements must
       be completed within 48 months and will participate with their AD counterpart during
       scheduled CUI Phase 0, 1 and 2 inspections. MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate with the AD
       and ARC unit CCs of Classic Associate units to determine reasonable/practical scope and
       scale of AD and ARC participation in scheduled inspections.
   2.6.4. Unit-Equipped ARC, Active-Associate TFI and ARC-Associate TFI units. CUI Phase
   0, 1 and 2 requirements must be completed within 60 months, while striving to complete
   these requirements within 48 months.
2.7. Air Force Inspection Scheduling Process. The purpose of the AF Inspection Scheduling
Process is to synchronize inspection efforts to maximize wing training days and inspection
resource utilization; build out-year schedules; and align non-AF inspection requirements with AF
inspection schedules. AFIA will coordinate work with MAJCOM/IGs to publish and update as
necessary a consolidated AF Inspection Schedule NLT 1 Mar each year for the next two fiscal
years, and a tentative schedule for the subsequent 2 fiscal years. For example, by 1 Mar 2012,
AFIA will publish the AF Inspection Schedule via an access-controlled website for FY13-14 and
a tentative schedule for FY 15-16. AFIA will host an annual AF-wide scheduling conference to
facilitate effective and efficient scheduling. MAJCOM/IGs and supporting Functional inspection
team leads will support pre-conference data requests and ensure the Gatekeeper or appropriate
representative attends the conference.
   2.7.1. Scheduling ROE. NGB-IG and MAJCOM/CG/CGG advisors will assist gaining
   MAJCOM/IG Gatekeepers with deconfliction between MAJCOM/IG inspection schedules
   and ANG unit AEF, mobilization and force structure changes.
2.8. MAJCOM Inspection Programs—General Guidelines. MAJCOM/IGs will establish
inspection programs consistent with Mission Directive responsibilities and in accordance with
AF inspection guidelines outlined in this Instruction.
   2.8.1. MAJCOM/IGs will conduct independent inspections to assess unit readiness,
   economy, efficiency, state of discipline and nuclear surety (as applicable) and report results
   of such inspections as required by MAJCOM/CC and this Instruction.
   2.8.2. Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers at all levels must ensure the inspection system is able to
   independently and efficiently inspect units on behalf of the command chain. Gatekeepers
   ensure a commander’s priorities take precedence over non-mission-essential activities of any
   unit/organization. Gatekeepers have the authority to approve or disapprove, schedule, de-
   conflict and eliminate duplication between all inspection-type activities on behalf of their
   commander. Gatekeepers do not have authority to approve or disapprove TJAG Article 6
   inspections, TAG-directed audits, TIG-directed AFIA/SAF/IGI inspections, or inspection-
   type activity conducted by properly authorized DoD or other USG agencies (e.g., OIG, DOD;
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            23


   GAO, DISA; DTRA). In these cases, Gatekeepers should attempt to deconflict the
   inspections by offering optimum windows for the appropriate units. MAJCOM/CCs should
   delegate MAJCOM Gatekeeper authority and responsibility to their MAJCOM/IG to perform
   Gatekeeper functions for all inspection-type activity within their MAJCOM.
       2.8.2.1. MAJCOM Gatekeeper functions include the ability to establish/maintain
       situational awareness and to integrate, synchronize and de-conflict unit inspections,
       assessments and evaluations within their MAJCOM. Gatekeeping unit inspections may
       include tracking organizations below the wing level as needed.
       2.8.2.2. Any agency planning to inspect, assess, evaluate, audit, assist, visit, or observe
       an Air Force unit/organization must contact the MAJCOM Gatekeeper as early as
       possible, and no later than 30 days prior to the desired visit.
       2.8.2.3. MAJCOM supplements to this publication may include MAJCOM/CC priorities
       to assist Gatekeepers in their roles (e.g., calendar “white space”, inspection frequency
       requirements, and waiver criteria) as well as guidance for inspecting multi-MAJCOM or
       Joint Base installations, if applicable. MAJCOM supplements to this publication will be
       coordinated with SAF/IGI.
       2.8.2.4. Gatekeepers at all levels should refer to Attachment 2 (Table of AF-approved
       inspections) to assist them in their Gatekeeper process.
          2.8.2.4.1. AF Agency Access to Inspect. Any AF agency requesting access to an
          installation for the purpose of conducting inspections (refer to paragraph 1.2.2.)
          must ensure the activity is on the list of AF-approved inspections (Attachment 2). If
          not, contact SAF/IGI IAW the process outlined in paragraph 2.18.2. If the
          Gatekeeper determines the requestor is not on the list of AF-approved inspections, the
          Gatekeeper should deny access to the installation and direct the requestor to follow
          the procedures in paragraph 2.18.2 to request the activity be vetted by the Inspection
          System Governance Process for addition to Attachment 2.
          2.8.2.4.2. Non-AF Agency Access to Inspect. Any non-AF agency (DOD, DTRA,
          DISA, GAO, etc.) requesting access to an installation to conduct inspection-type
          activity should contact AFIA and request liaison with appropriate MAJCOM
          Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers should make every effort to accommodate the request while
          balancing the need to guard wing whitespace through synchronization. Gatekeepers
          will notify SAF/IGI when a non-AF agency requests access for an activity not listed
          in Attachment 2.
          2.8.2.4.3. Non-AF Agency Request for Inspection Observation Access. Agencies
          external to the Air Force will coordinate requests to observe IG inspections through
          AFIA (primary) or SAF/IGI (secondary) for SAF/IG approval. Upon approval, AFIA
          will also serve as the liaison to coordinate with all external agencies requesting
          support and observer actions.
2.9. Pre-inspection considerations.
   2.9.1. Inspection alignment with the AEF-Next battle rhythm. Inspections should be de-
   conflicted with AEF-Next battle rhythm, enabler unit deployments, expeditionary support
   deployments and unit force structure changes. Inspections will be tailored, as necessary, to
24                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


  allow requisite unit support to the COCOM. MAJCOM/IGs will make final determination of
  scheduling and tailoring.
  2.9.2. All inspection authorities will consolidate inspections to avoid redundancy. Eliminate
  inspections that are not mission-relevant, do not outweigh their costs, or detract from mission
  performance or readiness.
     2.9.2.1. On-site inspections should evaluate areas the MAJCOM/CC determines to be
     essential for commander and mission effectiveness, and particular conditions of the
     command.
     2.9.2.2. Inspections will focus on programs and processes that impact mission readiness,
     economy, efficiency, and state of discipline.
     2.9.2.3. When scheduling inspections for units gained by multiple MAJCOMs,
     MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate the inspection schedules to conduct concurrent MAJCOM
     inspections, to the maximum extent possible.
  2.9.3. IG Reciprocity. If a MAJCOM IG team is inspecting in an area where another
  MAJCOM has a small geographically separated unit (GSU) or Detachment (Det) (as a tenant
  for instance), the tenant/GSU/Det’s owning MAJCOM IG may ask the other IG Team to
  inspect their unit(s) for efficiency. MAJCOM/IGs or their representatives should coordinate
  with one another to ensure the inspection team has adequate subject-matter expertise to
  conduct the inspection IAW this Instruction and MAJCOM/CC direction.
  2.9.4. Limiting factors, simulations and deviations. The inspected unit will submit any
  known limiting factors (LIMFAC), simulations (SIM) and deviations (DEV) that could
  potentially affect the inspection's outcome to the inspection team chief. Any such LIMFAC,
  SIM, or DEV from authorized policy and guidance will be coordinated with the
  MAJCOM/IG. Approved LIMFACs, SIMs and DEVs which may impact inspection
  processes and outcomes will be announced to all inspectors prior to the commencement of
  any inspection activities.
  2.9.5. Entry Authority List. The EAL will be sent to the host the Wing’s Security office at
  the location of the inspection for dissemination to inspected units/organizations.
  2.9.6. Inspection Footprint. IG Team Chiefs will work with the inspected unit prior to the
  inspection to ensure there is a shared understanding of inspection constraints due to space,
  security, escort ratio, etc. The Team Chief will attempt to minimize the inspector footprint to
  the maximum extent practical; however, the Team Chief will make the final determination on
  inspector footprint to ensure adequate access for the inspectors.
     2.9.6.1. MAJCOM/IGs may consider unit activity in conjunction with exercises and
     contingencies, real world operations, self-assessments, other inspections/evaluations,
     sampling techniques, and other measures of sustained performance. These measures can
     be used to grant inspection credit, or adjust the breadth, duration, and incidence of
     inspection activities.
     2.9.6.1. (AFISRA) Inspection footprint. The AFISRA/IG will bundle inspections
     among approximately located AFISRA and/or MAJCOM/SCC-subordinate units as well
     as with other MAJCOM, Joint or multi-agency IG teams.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                           25


       2.9.6.2. When practical, IG teams may deploy to forward locations and headquarters
       during exercises and contingency operations to evaluate processes and performance.
       Inspectors may observe, but will not interfere with, real world activities unless observed
       actions are in direct violation mandated guidance or if injury to personnel and/or damage
       to equipment could occur.
   2.9.7. IG Team Work Center Requirements. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will coordinate
   specific work center requirements with the inspected unit. Additionally, the inspected unit
   will provide at least one dedicated person for the duration of the inspection to answer and
   screen work center calls for the IG inspection team.
2.10. Inspection Notification. For active duty (AD) units, notification for regularly scheduled
inspections will be determined by the MAJCOM/IG for each inspection type. MAJCOM/IGs
will notify ARC units of regularly scheduled inspections with a minimum one year notice.
Additionally, MAJCOM/IGs (or designee) will send an Inspection Commencement Message for
all IG inspections, NLT 24 hours after inspection in-brief. Provide Inspection Commencement
Message to all appropriate agencies through the use of Attachment 4, Figure A4.1 of this
Instruction.
   2.10.1. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice Inspections.        No-notice and minimal-notice
   inspections are conducted to assess a unit’s day-to-day readiness to execute assigned
   missions, compliance with established directives and nuclear surety (as applicable). The
   MAJCOM/CC will determine the need for no-notice and minimal-notice inspections.
       2.10.1.1. For all units, no-notice is defined as 72 hours or less; minimal-notice is less
       than 45 calendar days.
       2.10.1.2. Trusted Agents.         SAF/IGI, AFIA, AFSC/SEW, NGB-IG and
       MAJCOM/AFISRA/ OSI/AFDW Gatekeepers, and Functional inspection team
       scheduling POCs who participate in the AF Inspection Scheduling Process are the trusted
       agents for no/minimal-notice inspections.
       2.10.1.3. ARC units will participate in MAJCOM/IG no-notice and minimal-notice NSIs
       and NORIs. AFRC/CC may direct no-notice or minimal-notice AFRC inspections.
       MAJCOM/IGs must recognize there may be limited availability of ARC unit personnel in
       some functional areas when initiating no/minimal-notice inspections.
       2.10.1.4. See Chapter 7 for no/minimal-notice inspections for FOAs/DRUs.
       2.10.1.5. MAJCOM/IGs with OCONUS units will make every effort to minimize
       notification to units when inspecting outside regularly scheduled inspections based on the
       host nation and theater limitations.
       2.10.1.6. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA no-notice inspections will grade all applicable
       Major Graded Areas (MGAs) on a three-tier grading scale of Satisfactory, Marginal or
       Unsatisfactory. Due to the limited scope and depth of the no notice inspection there will
       be no overall grade for the unit.
2.11. Selection for Performance-Based Evaluations. Inspection teams will randomly select
individuals/teams for executing performance-based evaluations in lieu of the inspected unit self-
identifying individuals/teams for evaluation (maintain team integrity as appropriate).
2.12. Inspecting Contracted Functions.
 26                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   2.12.1. Performance Work Statement (PWS). Assess and rate contracted functions against
   Performance Work Statements (PWS). Assess adequacy of PWS to meet mission
   requirements. Functional self-assessment checklists will be tailored to address differences
   between AF inspection requirements and PWS requirements. The Contracting Officer and/or
   Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will accompany the IG during inspections.
   Develop and implement safeguards to prevent contractor claims.
   2.12.2. Rating and Report. Contracted functions will be rated; however, individual
   contractors will not. Emphasis will be placed on the compliance of the function to be
   performed, not on the status of the personnel (military, civil service, or contractor)
   performing the function. Sampling of contracted activity will be coordinated through the
   Contracting Officer and/or Contracting Officer Representative (COR). Contractors may be
   provided with applicable portions of the report in-accordance-with (IAW) DOD Regulation
   5400.7/AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program.
   2.12.3. Validation. Validate observations related to contractor functions with the contracting
   officer. Deficiencies will be tracked IAW paragraph 2.16 Only the Contracting Officer can
   take formal action against the contractor for noncompliance or direct contractors to correct
   deficiencies identified during inspections.
2.13. Additional Inspections.
   2.13.1. Management Inspection (MI). MIs evaluate organizations or programs above the
   wing level and will normally be accomplished by AFIA. MAJCOM/IGs may only conduct
   an MI if AFIA’s checklist, methodology and grading criteria are used (see Chapter 7). The
   MI will assess the efficiency, effectiveness, economy and discipline of organizations,
   processes and programs based on fundamental principles of well-managed organizations.
   The MI will use a five-tier rating system (OUTSTANDING, EXCELLENT,
   SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL and UNSATISFACTORY). Refer to Chapter 7 for
   specifics of the Management Inspection.
   2.13.2. Federal Recognition Inspection (FRI). The gaining MAJCOM will conduct a FRI
   of a state unit when the unit is being considered for federal recognition, or when asked to do
   so by the NGB-IG. Conduct the FRI according to AFI 90-201 ANGSUP, The Air Force
   Inspection System.
   2.13.3. Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Inspections. AFMC/IG will conduct
   BSAT compliance inspections for all units that are registered by the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention in accordance with governing directives (DODI 5210.89_AFI 10-
   3901, Minimum Security Standards for Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and Toxin.
   The inspection is designed to evaluate a unit's compliance with applicable policies for
   laboratory operations within Biological Safety Level III (BSL) facilities which store and use
   BSAT.
   2.13.4. Wounded, Ill, and Injured (WII) Facility Inspections. When applicable,
   MAJCOM/IGs will conduct WII Facility Inspections, as required by National Defense
   Authorization Act (NDAA) Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, House Record (H.R.) 4986, Section
   1662, Access of Recovering Service Members to Adequate Outpatient Residential Facilities.
   WII Facility Inspections may be conducted in conjunction with other inspections (NSI, RI,
   CI) but will be a separate, distinct inspection providing a separate inspection report. WII
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            27


  Facility Inspections will utilize a 3-tier rating scale: IN COMPLIANCE, IN COMPLIANCE
  WITH COMMENTS, or NOT IN COMPLIANCE. Refer to Attachment 8 for specific
  information pertaining to WII inspections.
  2.13.5. Functional Evaluations and Assessments. With few exceptions, HAF Functionals
  and/or FAMs should not conduct inspections (ref. paragraph 1.2.2). All inspection-type
  activity should be conducted by IGs, augmented by functional experts from HQ staffs and
  other units. Functional evaluations will be synchronized with IG inspections by the
  MAJCOM Gatekeeper. When requested by the MAJCOM/IG, Functionals should provide
  subject-matter experts (SMEs) as IG inspector augmentees. When absolutely necessary,
  MAJCOM/IGs may elect to use the results of command functional evaluations, assessments,
  and/or audits in lieu of additional IG inspections in those areas, provided the criteria used in
  those evaluations and functional inspector qualifications meet or exceed the requirements of
  this Instruction. When utilized, the MAJCOM/IG will publish the results of the functional
  evaluations and assessments in the appropriate section of the MAJCOM/IG inspection report
  for that unit.
     2.13.5.1. (Added-AFISRA) In keeping with AF policy regarding inspection footprint,
     all AFISRA staff/functional inspections such as Standards & Evaluations inspections will
     integrate with AFISRA/IG inspections to max extent possible. Integration should include
     scheduling, planning and executing inspections. Post inspection reports should integrate
     where possible using the IGEMS in order to enable standardized tracking, trending of
     deficiencies and a single encompassing inspection report to the commander.
  2.13.6. The Air Force Special Interest Item (SII) Program. SIIs provide a means to focus
  management attention and/or gather data to evaluate the status of specific programs and
  conditions in the field requiring AF senior leader attention. SIIs are used by HAF
  Functionals to make policy adjustments and enhance decision-making. There should be no
  more than five active SIIs at any given time.
     2.13.6.1. SAF/IGI manages the AF SII program by coordinating AF SII topic proposals
     and obtaining SAF/IG approval; distributing approved AF SII to MAJCOM/IGs;
     compiling and forwarding SII data to the sponsoring agency.
     2.13.6.2. SAF/IGI will assess every potential SII for its impact on the nuclear enterprise
     and if necessary, coordinate with AF/A10 prior to publication.
     2.13.6.3. SII Sponsors. Only HAF Functionals may sponsor SIIs. Proposed SII topics
     may be initiated at any level but must be submitted by the appropriate HAF Functional to
     SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Submit SII topic proposals in the format
     provided on the SAF/IGI Air Force Enterprise Information Systems (AF EIS) Sharepoint
     website. Sponsors will coordinate with MAJCOM FAMs (to include, Guard/Reserve)
     prior to submitting a proposed AF SII.
     2.13.6.4. MAJCOM/IGs will receive SII notification from SAF/IGI. MAJCOM/IGs will
     notify all subordinate units/organizations (including gained ARC units) of the SII
     requirements as soon as possible following publication of the SII.
     2.13.6.5. MAJCOM/IGs will inspect all applicable active SIIs during formal inspections.
     Units need only be inspected and reported once during the SII’s active period. Gaining
     MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate with owning IGs prior to conducting SII inspections on
 28                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


      gained units. Document the results of SII inspections as a separate section of the final
      inspection report.
      2.13.6.6. Inspectors will watch for trends and violations in any Air Force SII area,
      though individual functional areas take the lead.
      2.13.6.7. SII Reports. MAJCOM/IGs will document SII results in IGEMS. Units not
      receiving an IG inspection during the active period of the SII will conduct a one-time
      self-inspection on the SII topic using the self-inspection checklist and instructions
      accompanying the SII and forward results to their MAJCOM/IG.
      2.13.6.8. Rating. Normally, SIIs will not be rated/graded; the SII is for gathering data
      for analysis and action as necessary. If a rating is required as part of the SII, the scale
      will be specified in the SII instructions.
   2.13.7. MAJCOM Command Interest Items (CII). Ensure that MAJCOM CIIs do not
   conflict with AF SIIs.
   2.13.7. (AFISRA) The AFISRA/IG will evaluate and staff nominations for AF-level
   Special Interest Items (SII) and AFISRA-level Commander’s Interest Items (CII). Reference
   Attachment 12 for information regarding AFISRA sponsored SIIs.
2.14. Inspector General Evaluation Management System (IGEMS).
   2.14.1. IGEMS is the official Program of Record for the Air Force Inspection System. NLT
   1 Apr 2012, MAJCOM/IGs will use IGEMS for the following functions at a minimum:
      2.14.1.1. The unit’s overall rating.
      2.14.1.2. Critical deficiencies and their respective corrective action plans (include the
      Deficiency Cause Code from Attachment 7, Deficiency Cause Codes and Explanations).
      2.14.1.3. Significant deficiencies and their respective corrective action plans (include the
      Deficiency Cause Code from Attachment 7).
      2.14.1.4. Key minor deficiencies and their respective corrective action plans, as
      determined by the MAJCOM/IG (include the Deficiency Cause Code from Attachment
      7).
      2.14.1.5. The dates when critical and significant deficiencies are opened and when they
      are closed.
      2.14.1.6. All IG deficiencies, and only IG deficiencies, will be entered into IGEMs. IGs
      may enter deficiencies found by non-IG inspectors into IGEMS only after assessing and
      validating the deficiencies IAW AFI 90-201. IG Augmentees from Functional Areas
      may also enter data in functional data systems in addition to, not in lieu of, IGEMS.
      2.14.1.7. Post the final inspection report in IGEMS.
   2.14.2. For classified inspection reporting, use existing reporting methods on the Secret
   Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). IG teams will fully utilize IGEMS-C within
   six months of IGEMS-C certification and availability for classified inspection reporting.
   2.14.3. Access management. Access to IGEMS will be administered by AFIA, SAF/IGI and
   MAJCOM/IG Administrators.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            29


2.15. Inspection Reports.
   2.15.1. Classification. Review all reports prior to publication to ensure they are properly
   classified and marked IAW DOD 5200.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of DOD
   Intelligence Components that Affect United States Persons and AFI 31-401.
   2.15.1. (AFISRA) Inspection reports will be security reviewed prior to distribution to
   ensure proper classification. Classified reports may be produced in order to provide critical,
   but classified, cross-tell information to AFISRA and MAJCOM/SCC-subordinate units.
   2.15.2. Report Marking. At a minimum, mark unclassified inspection reports "For Official
   Use Only (FOUO)" IAW DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401. For nuclear inspection reports,
   see Chapter 4.
   2.15.3. Releasability. TIG is the confidential agent of SECAF and CSAF for obtaining
   uninhibited self-analysis and self-criticism of the internal management, operation, and
   administration of the Air Force. Therefore, Air Force IG reports are internal memoranda and
   constitute privileged information that is not releasable outside the AF except with specific
   approval of TIG. All requests for IG reports, or extracts therefrom, originating from sources
   outside the original distribution, shall be referred to SAF/IGI for coordination and clearance.
   Classifications and restrictions on the disclosure or use of IG reports shall be strictly
   observed.
   2.15.3. (AFISRA) Official requests for AFISRA inspection reports. All official requests for
   AFISRA inspection reports are referred to AFISRA/IGP.
      2.15.3.1. Release Determination Authority. Before releasing inspection reports outside
      DOD, FOIA offices will receive a final release determination from SAF/IGI. Non-DOD
      parties requesting inspection reports should be referred to the appropriate FOIA office.
      2.15.3.2. Release within DOD. DOD members, DOD contractors, consultants, and
      grantees are permitted access to inspection reports IAW DOD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-
      302. MAJCOM/IGs are authorized to release inspection reports, in whole or in part,
      within DOD. Courtesy copy SAF/IGI on any inspection report released outside the Air
      Force.
      2.15.3.3. Release of Inspection Summary to News Media. An inspection summary may
      be released for internal information or in response to news media queries in coordination
      with public affairs. The summary will be limited to the overall rating, inspection
      process/definition and, if desired, personal comments by the commander (e.g. general
      laudatory comments, perception of inspection process). The published summary will not
      contain detailed information (e.g. sub-area ratings, a list of individuals recognized by the
      IG, specific deficiencies, or specific ratings for inspection criteria). The use of HAF and
      MAJCOM Public Affairs Guidance (PAG) are encouraged.
      2.15.3.4. Releasability Statement. The following statement must appear on the cover and
      each page of the report as well as in any transmission, presentation, or document
      containing protected IG material: “For Official Use Only. This report may be protected
      from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Do not release or publish, in
      whole or in part, outside official DOD channels without express approval of the Director,
 30                                                AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


       SAF/IGI.” Include similar statements on reports of inspections conducted jointly with
       inspection teams from other DOD agencies.
   2.15.4. NLT 5 work days after the IG team outbriefs the inspected unit, the MAJCOM/IG
   will send an executive summary of the inspection, IAW Figure A4.2 to the inspected unit
   CC and SAF/IGI, unless the final inspection report has already been published and
   distributed.
   2.15.5. NLT 30 days after the IG team departs the inspected unit, the MAJCOM/IG will send
   the final IG inspection report and notify organizations the final IG inspection report is
   available in IGEMS.
2.16. Inspection Deficiencies.
   2.16.1. All inspection reports will address non-primary inspection activity deficiencies,
   including safety, surety, or issues of military discipline. These concerns may directly affect
   an overall inspection rating at the discretion of the inspection team chief and will be
   documented in the final inspection report. Inspection reports will include only findings
   categorized as Strengths, Deficiencies or Recommended Improvement Areas (RIA). RIAs
   will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-compliance; they are only used to
   identify areas where a more efficient or effective course of action is available.
   2.16.2. Safety. Safety is an integral part of every inspection. Inspectors will assess safety
   procedures and workplace hazards during all inspections, notify the appropriate commander
   and safety office of concerns, and document in the report if required.
   2.16.3. Surety. Nuclear surety, at nuclear capable units, is always subject to inspection
   during any IG inspection. A potential nuclear surety deficiency will be brought to the
   immediate attention of the inspection team chief. The team chief will determine the
   appropriate course of action and determine the impact (if any) on the inspection rating.
   2.16.4. Validation. MAJCOM/IGs will establish a validation process that provides the
   inspected unit the opportunity to clarify and/or rebut in a timely manner any potential
   deficiencies identified during the inspection. MAJCOM/IG Team Chief, in coordination
   with the wing or unit under inspection, will coordinate with the appropriate
   MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU FAMs on all critical and significant deficiencies identified
   during the inspection. This process applies to deficiencies levied against other MAJCOM
   units or HHQ organizations.
   2.16.4. (AFISRA) Deficiency validation. The HQ AFISRA/IG or functional inspectors
   conduct validation of potential deficiencies with unit commanders on a daily basis. In cases
   of a potential Critical or Significant deficiency, the inspector will validate the deficiency at
   the lowest appropriate unit and AFISRA Functional Area Manager (FAM) level to resolve
   any policy interpretation differences. HQ AFISRA/IG presents the commander the details of
   the deficiency. The unit commanders may submit a formal rebuttal within 24 hours of
   notification (formal letter presented during outbrief) through their wing/group commander to
   present to the IG for review. The rebuttal will include clarification of facts that may mitigate
   the potential deficiency. Specifics governing the validation process are defined in
   Attachment 10.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            31


     2.16.4.1. Inspectors will validate potential deficiencies at the lowest possible level, but
     no higher than the appropriate FAM at the respective MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU or
     organizations with whom the IG team has a memorandum of agreement.
     MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU FAMs will consult with the appropriate HAF Functional as
     required to ensure proper interpretation of Air Force (or higher) policy.
     2.16.4.2. MAJCOM FAMs or other SMEs will clarify policy and procedures, or validate
     that a potential deficiency does/does not comply with policy, and will not provide
     input/comment on the severity of a validated deficiency; that responsibility resides with
     the MAJCOM/IG. All deficiencies coded CRITICAL or SEVERE that cite "safety"
     should be validated by a qualified safety professional (mil: 1SOXX, 2WXX, 21MX, Civ:
     0018, or MAJCOM FAM-designated SME).
     2.16.4.3. Oversight Deficiencies. MAJCOM/IGs are not required to validate deficiencies
     beyond the appropriate MAJCOM FAMs or agencies with whom the IG has MOA/MOU
     for validation support. If the oversight team independently validates with the HAF
     Functional and receives contradictory information, a deficiency may be levied against the
     MAJCOM and/or HAF Functional.
     2.16.4.4. All validated deficiencies will be documented in the report.
  2.16.5. Deficiency Cause Codes. Corrective action OPRs will assign Deficiency Cause
  Codes to all deficiencies in IGEMS IAW Attachment 7.
  2.16.6. Deficiencies External to the Inspected Unit. When a MAJCOM/IG team is
  considering assigning a deficiency to an organization outside their MAJCOM, the inspecting
  IG team chief will notify the owning MAJCOM/IG of the potential deficiency and validation
  details (or AFIA for DRU/FOAs, HAF or non-AF deficiencies) and courtesy copy both the
  tenant and host base units NLT 5 days after completion of the inspection. If possible,
  validate each deficiency with the potential Corrective Action OPR and gain concurrence that
  the OPR will accept the deficiency; however, Corrective Action OPR concurrence with
  deficiency assignment or wording is not required. Once validated, the owning MAJCOM/IG
  (or AFIA) will be responsible for tracking status and notifying the inspecting MAJCOM/IG
  when closed (See paragraph 4.13. for reporting, tracking, and closure reporting of DTRA-
  identified NSI deficiencies). In instances where the inspection involves associate units,
  coordination between the associated and associating MAJCOM/IGs on how deficiencies are
  assigned, assessed, and resolved will be essential to ensuring timely resolution.
  2.16.7. Deficiency write-ups will:
     2.16.7.1. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
     2.16.7.2. Describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and contextual facts as necessary to
     clearly convey the defect requiring resolution. The written description alone should be
     adequate for the inspected party to begin corrective action planning.
     2.16.7.3. Be assigned a deficiency severity of CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR.
     2.16.7.4. Reference the applicable instruction, technical order or other source
     documentation.
     2.16.7.5. Address impact of continued deviation or non-compliance for critical
     deficiencies.
32                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


     2.16.7.6. Identify MAJCOM FAM OPRs for CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT
     deficiencies (MAJCOM functional office responsible for coordinating on unit’s
     corrective action plan).
     2.16.7.7. Identify the Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR), if applicable.
     2.16.7.8. Deficiencies that involve hosts/tenants outside the inspected unit’s chain-of-
     command, HHQ, other MAJCOMs, DRU/FOA, HAF or non-AF entities will be
     categorized as HHQ/Support Agency Deficiencies.
  2.16.8. Deficiency Corrective Actions.
     2.16.8.1. At a minimum, the MAJCOM/IG will track all CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT
     deficiencies and provide the inspected unit with MAJCOM-unique reply instructions as
     part of the final report. Associated corrective action plans will be provided to
     MAJCOM/IGs NLT 45 days and for ARC units NLT 90 days after the final inspection
     report is published. CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies require a description of
     the unit’s corrective action to include root cause(s), Cause Code(s) assigned from
     Attachment 7, and countermeasures initiated to mitigate risk and/or preclude deficiency
     recurrence. Minor deficiencies assessed to the inspected unit will be closed at the wing
     level. Minor deficiencies assessed to the MAJCOM-level will be closed by the
     MAJCOM/IG.
         2.16.8.1.1. MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU FAMs will coordinate and approve
         corrective action plans, on behalf of the MAJCOM/CC, for all CRITICAL and
         SIGNIFICANT deficiencies.        Once the corrective action plan is in place,
         MAJCOM/IGs, after review and coordination with the responsible MAJCOM/NGB
         FAM(s), may close the identified deficiencies.
         2.16.8.1.2. All deficiencies not requiring a long-term solution (as determined by the
         MAJCOM/IG) should be closed within 12 months (18 months for ARC).
         2.16.8.1.3. In instances where corrective action responsibility is assigned to both the
         host and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit), MAJCOM/IGs will assign an
         OPR and an OCR to correct the identified deficiencies.
         2.16.8.1.4. Deficiencies that contain potential Fraud, Waste or Abuse will be
         highlighted in inspection reports and forwarded to the MAJCOM/IG for semi-annual
         reporting.
     2.16.8.2. MAJCOM/IGs will forward MAJCOM-closed root cause(s), Cause Code(s),
     countermeasures, to include OPR(s) and ECD(s), and deficiency closure dates for all
     nuclear-related CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies to the AFIA Process
     Integration Directorate (AFIA/PI). For open deficiencies, the corrective action OPR will
     report status to the MAJCOM IG quarterly until closed.
     2.16.8.3. MAJCOM/IGs will forward all HAF-level (FOA/DRU, HAF, and non-AF)
     actionable deficiencies and validation details to AFIA for deficiency processing.
     Validation details include MAJCOM, FOA/DRU, HAF, and non-AF Functional(s) who
     participated in the deficiency validation and contact info. AFIA will forward the
     deficiency and problem solving/corrective action requirements to the responsible HAF-
     level office (O-6/GS equivalent or above) for action or comment and copy the
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            33


     MAJCOM/IG.         The corrective action OPR will determine root cause(s) and
     countermeasure(s), to include OPR(s) and ECD(s), and assign Cause Code(s) from AFI
     90-201, Attachment 7. AFIA will provide corrective action OPR an electronic template
     to document the required problem solving/corrective action data. Corrective action OPRs
     will include measures or procedures initiated to mitigate risk and/or preclude deficiency
     recurrence and enough detail for the MAJCOM/IG to evaluate whether to close the
     deficiency or keep it open. If corrective action is not complete, the corrective action OPR
     will describe progress and provide updates, as required. The corrective action response,
     i.e., completed template and, if needed, additional documentation, will be returned
     electronically to the MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. After review, the MAJCOM/IG will
     forward a deficiency closure recommendation to AFIA. AFIA will close the deficiency,
     maintain corrective action documentation, and conduct follow-up on open deficiencies.
     2.16.8.4. Commanders of inspected units will ensure that unit OPRs enter deficiency
     resolution data (e.g., root cause analysis results and corrective action plan status
     information) into the IGEMS database in a timely manner.
  2.16.9. Root Cause Analysis. Problem-solving responsibility and the corrective action
  process reside at the lowest appropriate command level. Commanders will ensure root cause
  analysis is completed for all deficiencies using the problem-solving approach/tool and level
  of effort best suited to the situation. Commanders should strongly consider using the rigor of
  the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Model as outlined in the AF Smart Operations for the 21 st
  Century (AFSO21) playbook for CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies to determine
  primary and, if applicable, contributing root causes.
  2.16.10. Deficiency Fix Rate (DFR). MAJCOM/IGs and AFIA will monitor DFR for all
  identified CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies. DFR is a key measure of
  performance to show the average number of days required to close a deficiency. The DFR
  clock starts on the date of the inspection outbrief. The DFR clock stops when the deficiency
  is closed. For a long-term deficiency (one in which the fix runs through the Future Years
  Defense Plan), once the proper mitigation is in place to effectively manage the deficiency
  risk, deficiency closure may be appropriate. DFR will be incorporated into future IGEMS
  capability.
  2.16.11. MAJCOM/IGs will also provide Cause Codes assigned by the corrective action
  OPR(s) for all nuclear-related MINOR deficiencies via the template. An electronic copy of
  this template can be requested from AFIA/PI workflow at afia.pi@kirtland.af.mil. An
  updated template will be sent to AFIA/PI when all unit level deficiencies are closed. If all
  deficiencies are not closed within 90 days after a published final inspection report, the
  corrective action OPR will report status of all deficiencies to the MAJCOM/IG quarterly
  until complete.
  2.16.12. The Deficiency Cause Codes listed in Attachment 7 apply to all inspections listed
  in this AFI except DNSIs, which have unique codes assigned by DOD (see Chapter 4 for
  nuclear-specific inspection guidance). Assign all Deficiency Cause Codes required to
  describe the deficiency. Commonly, more than one Deficiency Cause Code will be
  applicable. NOTE: If the code “OT” (Other) is used, a full description must be included.
  2.16.13. Write-ups from previous inspections should be reviewed prior to an inspection. At
  the conclusion of the inspection, repeat deficiencies should be considered in the unit’s overall
 34                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   rating. Identify the repeat deficiency by stating: “REPEAT DEFICIENCY,” followed by the
   updated deficiency write-up. Repeat deficiencies are deficiencies that have been previously
   identified, corrected, and closed, and have recurred following closure.
2.17. Inspection Outbrief. A mass outbrief conducted by the IG following a CUI Phase 0, 1 or
2 or other large-scale unit inspection is mandatory. Commanders should provide a suitable
location to ensure maximum attendance within resource capability.
   2.17.1. Unit outbriefs are considered a version of the inspection report and consequently fall
   within releasability restrictions. DOD members, contractors, consultants, and grantees are
   permitted to attend inspection outbriefs at the discretion of the unit commander. Community
   leaders and the general public are not authorized access to inspection results, to include
   outbriefs, except as permitted by DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement (see
   paragraph 2.15.3.)
2.18. The Air Force Inspection System Governance Process.
   2.18.1. The governance process is executed by three groups shown in Figure 2.1. Charters
   for each of the groups will contain detailed duties and functions.

Figure 2.1. AF Inspection System Governance Process.




       2.18.1.1. Inspection System Working Group (ISWG). The ISWG will meet quarterly to
       discuss the adequacy of the AFIS and proposals for improving the AFIS. The ISWG will
       be chaired by SAF/IGI with membership from key HAF 2-letter O-6/Civilian Equivalent
       representatives (AF/A1, AF/A2, AF/A3/5, AF/A4/7, SAF/CIO A6, AF/A8, AF/A9,
       AF/A10, AF/SG, AF/JA, SAF/AA, SAF/IE, AF/SE, NGB/IG, SAF/FM) and
       MAJCOM/IGs. The ISWG will vet proposals and track action items for consideration by
       the Inspector General Advisory Board (IGAB) and/or the Inspection System Council
       (ISC).
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                           35


      2.18.1.2. Inspector General Advisory Board (IGAB). The IGAB will meet semi-
      annually to discuss issues forwarded by the ISWG and any other inspection related
      business deemed appropriate for this forum. SAF/IG will chair the IGAB, comprised of
      key 2-letter Functionals, or their Deputies. SAF/IGI will act as the Executive Secretary
      for the IGAB.
      2.18.1.3. Inspection System Council (ISC). The ISC will meet semi-annually in
      conjunction with existing MAJCOM/CV meetings to discuss any inspection related
      business and to approve/disapprove suggestions for improving the AFIS submitted by the
      ISWG or IGAB. SAF/IG will chair the ISC, comprised of MAJCOM/CVs and selected
      FOA/DRU CCs. SAF/IGI will be the Executive Secretary for the ISC.
   2.18.2. Process to Change List of Authorized Inspections (Attachment 2) or Inspection
   Requirements (Attachment 3). AF agencies should submit requests to change, add or
   subtract an inspection activity listed in Attachment 2, or an inspection requirement listed in
   Attachment 3, to the appropriate HAF 2-letter for coordination. AF/JA will determine all
   JA Functional inspection requirements. HAF 2-letters may submit the recommendation to
   SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil for vetting through the AFIS Governance
   Process. The request should include a 1-page justification, OPR and phone number for
   further clarification.
      2.18.2.1. Non-AF agencies should contact SAF/IGI with a request to change/add/subtract
      an inspection activity in Attachment 2. SAF/IGI will gain TIG’s approval and notify
      IGAB and ISC members at the next meeting.
   2.18.3. TIG-approved changes. TIG may modify the AFIS to meet SECAF/CSAF intent.
   Decisions reached during an IG conference or IG-led Process Review Group (to include the
   NSI PRG) will be incorporated into AFI 90-201 with SAF/IG approval.
      2.18.3.1. Approved changes to the AFIS will be published via Guidance Memorandum,
      Interim Change, or complete revision of this publication.
   2.18.4. AFIS Suggestion Program. Any Airman may submit an idea for improving the AF
   Inspection System to SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil with the words “AFIS
   Improvement” in the subject line.
2.19. Future State of the AFIS:
   2.19.1. At a date to be determined, certified IG inspectors will be required to carry
   appropriate credentials.

                                         Chapter 3

                      CONSOLIDATED UNIT INSPECTION (CUI)

3.1. General Information. A CUI is completed when the requirements for a Phase 0, 1 & 2 are
completed. MAJCOM/IGs may tailor the composition and synchronization of CUI elements to
optimize inspection effectiveness and efficiency IAW the intent of this Instruction.
   3.1.1. Phase 0. Phase 0 is an inspection scheduling construct that enables synchronized
   compliance-focused inspections in approximately one week at each unit. During a Phase 0,
   MAJCOM IGs should complete a Compliance Inspection (CI) and AFIA should accomplish
   a Health Services Inspection (HSI). The A4’s Logistics Compliance Assessment Program
   (LCAP) and the JA’s Article 6 inspection should be synchronized to occur during a Phase 0.
   Gatekeepers should offer the opportunity for DISA’s Command Cyber Readiness Inspection
   (CCRI) and DTRA’s Balanced Survivability Assessment (BSA) to be completed as required
   at the inspected unit. MAJCOM/IGs may conduct other IG inspections and compliance-
   focused Functional inspections during Phase 0. Only those synchronized inspections whose
   data will be validated by the IG and entered into IGEMS will be included in the IG’s final
   report. See Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1. Intended CUI Structure.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                         37


  3.1.2. Phase 1 & 2. Phase 1 & 2 is a scheduling construct that enables synchronized
  readiness-focused inspections in approximately one week at each unit. During Phase 1 & 2,
  MAJCOM IGs should complete a Readiness Inspection (RI). MAJCOM/IGs may conduct
  other IG inspections and synchronized Functional inspections during Phase 1 & 2 as
  required. Only those synchronized inspections whose data will be validated by the IG and
  entered into IGEMS will be included in the IG’s final report.
  3.1.3. CUI Re-inspection. Units receiving an overall rating of UNSATISFACTORY during
  a CUI Phase 0, 1 or 2 will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 6 months. MAJCOM/CC
  approval is required to exceed the 6-month re-inspection interval. MAJCOM/IG will
  determine whether to reaccomplish the entire inspection or to limit the re-inspection to only
  those MGAs rated MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY.
  3.1.4. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA/IG will serve as the single point of contact with the
  inspected unit for planning the inspection; as such, Consolidated Unit Inspection (CUI)
  partners, including ANG elements, will coordinate all deliverables with AFISRA/IGP
  inspection planners and support/work center requirements. AFISRA CUI partners include
  Intelligence Standardization and Evaluation Visits (ISEV) and Logistics Compliance
  Assessment Program (LCAP).
     3.1.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) IG Team Chief will serve as overall Team Chief for the CUI
     and provide “top cover” for all CUI partners.
     3.1.4.2. (Added-AFISRA) The AFISRA/IG will send out the inspection initiation
     message to all required addressees. Content and addressees will be pre-coordinated
     through all CUI team leads.
     3.1.4.3. (Added-AFISRA) Unit will provide a mission and local conditions brief on the
     first day of the inspection, attended by all CUI inspectors. IG TC will brief the overview
     and general topics, and each CUI sub-inspection type Team Lead will brief as required
     for any unique requirements.
     3.1.4.4. (Added-AFISRA) IG Team Chief will collect inputs from all CUI inspectors
     and conduct a daily feedback session with the unit CC.
     3.1.4.5. (Added-AFISRA) Each CUI inspector will provide feedback as warranted with
     their appropriate inspected unit functional area contact, emphasizing any significant
     issues uncovered.
     3.1.4.6. (Added-AFISRA) IG TC will conduct daily team meetings for all CUI
     inspectors/assessors.
     3.1.4.7. (Added-AFISRA) Inspection results will be reported by all CUI inspectors in
     Inspector General Evaluation Management System (IGEMS) as Strengths,
     Recommended Improvements Areas, and Deficiencies.
     3.1.4.8. (Added-AFISRA) IG TC will assign an overall CUI grade based on inputs
     from all the CI Major Graded Areas and sub-inspection types as appropriate.
     3.1.4.9. (Added-AFISRA) A Mass Out-Brief will be conducted by the IG Team Chief
     and designated briefers, capturing the results of all CUI Major Graded Areas and sub-
     inspection types.
 38                                            AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


      3.1.4.10. (Added-AFISRA) The AFISRA/IG will send out the inspection results
      executive summary to all required addressees. Content and addressees will be pre-
      coordinated through all CUI team leads.
      3.1.4.11. (Added-AFISRA) The AFISRA/IG is the final approval authority for the
      report, with no coordination required beyond sub-inspection team leads.
      3.1.4.12. (Added-AFISRA) Corrective actions to address any deficiencies will be
      orchestrated to closure with AFISRA FAMs and AFISRA/IGI using IGEMS IAW
      Attachment 10 (Tables A10.1 and A10.2).
      3.1.4.13. (Added-AFISRA) Integrated CUI partners will document inspection results in
      IGEMS. Synchronized CUI partners (i.e., LCAP, Article 6,) may document inspection
      results in IGEMS. If not documenting in IGEMS, synchronized CUI partners will
      provide the IG with their report for inclusion as an addendum to the overall CUI report
      NLT 2-weeks after the inspection completion date.
3.2. CUI Scheduling Considerations.
   3.2.1. Extension-Induced Constraints. MAJCOM/CC extension of CUI Phase 0 frequency to
   48/60 months IAW paragraph 2.6 may cause the MAJCOM/IG to conduct a Tailored CI.
   For Active Duty and Classic-Associate units, a Tailored CI is required if a CI is not
   completed at least every 30 months. For unit-equipped ARC, Active-Associate and ARC-
   Associate TFI units, a Tailored CI is required if a CI is not completed at least every 36
   months. Tailored CIs are not applicable to ANG units. The Tailored CI should include an
   HSI and a sample of requirements from NWRM, Weather Operations (formerly
   Standardization and Evaluation Program for Weather Operations (SEPWO)), Airfield
   Operations Certification Inspection (AOCI) (formerly Air Traffic System Evaluation
   Program (ATSEP)), Environmental, Safety, Occupational Health Compliance Assessment
   Management Program (ESOHCAMP), and AF Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL)
   areas listed in Attachment 3. MAJCOM IGs may synchronize a Tailored CI with other
   inspections. Figure 3.2 shows one example of a Tailored CI being synchronized with a
   Readiness Inspection.
   3.2.2. Synchronization Constraints. MAJCOM/IGs should attempt to complete all elements
   of CUI Phase 0, 1 & 2 in approximately 2 weeks every 2 years (48 months for ARC).
   However, based on resource constraints (e.g., high-demand/low-density inspection team
   availability, airlift, billeting, vehicles, workcenter size), MAJCOM/IGs may schedule
   portions of CUI elements before/after the primary inspection week.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                          39


Figure 3.2. CUI with Tailored CI made necessary by CUI Frequency Extension.




3.3. Compliance Inspection (CI). CIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well
as mission areas that are critical or important to the health and performance of organizations.
Unit failure to comply with the established directives in these areas could result in legal
liabilities, penalties, or mission impact.
   3.3.1. CI Sampling. During a CI, MAJCOM/IGs will inspect all applicable mandatory AF
   inspection requirements (indicated in Attachment 3 by a thick, dark vertical line in the
   column labeled, “MANDATORY”), HAF SIIs, MAJCOM/CC interest items, by-law
   requirements and a sample of the inspection requirements in each applicable MGA (indicated
   by light blue headings) and Sub-Area (indicated by light gray headings) in Attachment 3.
   The IG Team Chief will determine which other line items from Attachment 3 to include in a
   given unit’s sample, based on collaboration with MAJCOM/DRU/FOA FAMs and the needs
   of the commander.
   3.3.2. CI Rating. The overall inspection, compliance MGAs and sub-areas will be rated
   using the following five-tier scale:

   3.3.3. Major Graded Areas (MGAs) and Sub-areas. MGAs represent key processes,
   procedures, and requirements based on public law, executive orders, DOD, AF, MAJCOM,
   and ARC directives and instructions. MAJCOMs may supplement the requirements of AF
   MGAs and add MAJCOM-specific MGAs. MGAs are organized according to Functional
   policy origin and are identified in Attachment 3 in light blue color. Sub-areas of each MGA
   are identified in gray color.
   3.3.4. Inspection of Nuclear Weapon Related Materiel (NWRM). MAJCOM/IGs will
   coordinate with MAJCOM/NGB FAMs to determine units to be inspected based on the
   official Air Force list of NWRM National Stock Numbers. NWRM requirements are now
   located under the Logistics (A4/7) inspection requirements in Attachment 3. NWRM
   inspection requirements will be accomplished as an MGA during a Phase 0 CI and a Phase

   synchronize the scheduling of ESOHCAMPs with CUI Phase 0 CI to the maximum extent
   possible. MAJCOM/IG inspections of the Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health
   functional areas will not duplicate NGB ESOHCAMP inspection elements. MAJCOM/IG
   should arrange to receive a copy of the NGB ESOHCAMP report. MAJCOM/IG may
   review the status of discrepancies noted in NGB ESOHCAMP reports.
3.4. Readiness Inspection (RI). RIs evaluate and measure the ability of units to perform their
conventional wartime, contingency or force sustainment missions IAW the Defense Readiness
Reporting System (DRRS) Mission Essential Task List (METL), or unit's DOC statement and
Status of Resources & Training System (SORTS) report. For maximum effectiveness in
assessing operational readiness, all readiness MGAs should be assessed during the same visit.
However, if required to divide the inspection into separate visits, the inspection will consist of
two phases.
   3.4.1. RI Phase 1. Evaluates the unit’s transition from peacetime readiness to a wartime
   posture and their ability to maintain and sustain essential home station missions during this

                                           Chapter 4

                   AIR FORCE NUCLEAR INSPECTION PROGRAMS

4.1. Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspections (NWTI). Nuclear weapon systems require
special consideration because of their political and military importance, their destructive power,
and the potential consequences of an accident or unauthorized act. NWTIs are performance and
compliance-based inspections and are conducted to evaluate a unit's ability to manage nuclear
resources while complying with all nuclear surety standards (reference DoD 3150.2-M, DoD
Nuclear Weapons System Safety Program Manual). CJCSI 3263.05 is the governing Instruction
for the conduct of NWTIs. In instances where CJCSI 3263.05 specifies responsibilities for
“Service,” MAJCOMs fill that role. The NSI is the AF inspection used to satisfy requirements of
an NWTI. AF inspection teams will conduct NSIs in accordance with CJCSI 3263.05 and
reference this AFI for additional AF-specific inspection requirements. If there is conflict
between CJCSI 3263.05 and this Instruction, CJCSI 3263.05 takes precedence. See paragraph
3.3.4. and Attachment 3 for NWRM inspection guidance.
4.2. Nuclear Surety Inspector Eligibility, Training and Certification. In addition to the
requirements of Chapter 8, to fulfill inspection oversight data collection, MAJCOM/IGs will
provide training and certification status, IG experience level and number of NSIs to AFIA for
tracking and trending.
4.3. Nuclear-Capable Unit Operational Certification and Operational Restriction. Refer to
AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program and AF/A10 guidance.
4.4. Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection (INSI). The INSI is the culminating step both in the
Operational Certification Process for certifying a unit as nuclear-capable as well certifying new
equipment and/or systems requiring nuclear certification. The Lead/using MAJCOM, in
coordination with HQ AFSC/SEW, will determine the need for conducting INSI based upon AFI
63-125 requirements and any HQ/A10 supplemental guidance. Applicable Functional(s) will
develop READY/NOT READY inspection criteria to be used by the MAJCOM/IG during the
INSI. In order to meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the
AFIA/TI at least 60 calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 4.14.2 and
7.3.). MAJCOM/IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement
and conclusion using Attachment 4.
   4.4.1. For units not previously nuclear-certified, conduct an INSI prior to employing,
   storing, assembling, maintaining or transporting War Reserve (WR). Conduct an NSI within
   180-calendar days of the unit receiving an INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the
   MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180-calendar days after the unit receives the
   READY rating.
   4.4.2. For currently certified nuclear-capable units programmed to receive a new weapon
   system/delivery system, conduct an INSI of operations and maintenance supporting the new
   system prior to receipt. Conduct an NSI within 180-calendar days of the unit receiving an
   INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180-
   calendar days after the unit receives the READY rating.
   4.4.3. For decertified nuclear-capable units, conduct an INSI prior to resuming those
   operations (employing, storing, assembling, maintaining or transporting WR) for which the
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                             53


   unit has been decertified to accomplish, as specified by the MAJCOM/CC in the
   decertification directive. Once an INSI has been successfully accomplished and the nuclear-
   certified status reinstated, conduct an NSI within 180-calendar days of the unit receiving the
   INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180-
   calendar days after the unit receives the READY rating.
   4.4.4. A READY rating for an EOD team or nuclear airlift unit establishes the NWTI cycle
   for that unit IAW DoD 3150.2M. A READY INSI rating and certification for new and/or
   modified facilities, equipment and/or systems do not alter or reset the unit's existing NWTI
   cycle unless the INSI is accomplished in conjunction with a full-scale NSI.
   4.4.5. INSIs may be conducted in phases. If phased INSIs are conducted, the responsible
   MAJCOM will prepare an inspection plan identifying all required areas to be inspected by
   phase and forward the plan to HQ AFSC/SEW for review and approval. A READY rating
   must be achieved and maintained for the phase of the INSI under evaluation before
   evaluating the next phase. All phases must be rated READY prior to assuming nuclear
   operations. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, a Phased READY rating expires 180-
   calendar days from issuance. Conduct a NSI, on all portions of the unit’s nuclear mission, to
   include the addition of all phases, within 180-calendar days of final INSI completion.
4.5. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). Assesses a unit's ability to accomplish its assigned
nuclear weapons mission and produce reliable nuclear weapons in a safe and secure environment
in compliance with applicable directives. Additionally, an NSI inspects a unit’s capability to
safely and reliably receive, store, secure, assemble, transport, maintain, load, mate, lock/unlock,
test, render safe and employ nuclear weapons. Missile launch crews, aircrews, command post
controllers and release teams must demonstrate (through performance-based assessments,
testing, etc.) their knowledge of weapon acceptance procedures, nuclear weapon system safety
rules, and nuclear weapon control order handling and authentication procedures. In order to
meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the AFIA/TI at least
60 calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 4.14.2. and 7.3).
MAJCOM/IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement and
conclusion using Attachment 4.
   4.5.1. Frequency of NSIs.
       4.5.1.1. Inspection Frequency. Conduct NSIs of each nuclear-capable unit IAW DOD
       3150.2M. The frequency (date next scheduled inspection due) is based on the date of the
       unit outbrief.
           4.5.1.1.1. Waiver to Decertification Requirement for Expired NSI. If a nuclear-
           capable unit does not receive an NSI within the timing required by DOD 3150.2M,
           MAJCOM/CCs may elect to continue the certification of a unit by waiving the
           decertification requirement IAW CJCSI 3263.05. The MAJCOM/CC will notify
           agencies required by CJCSI 3263.05 and provide informational copies to the CSAF
           and recipients listed in Table A4.2, Group 1. Waiver notification will include the
           date of the scheduled NSI.
       4.5.1.2. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice NSIs. While not every full-scale NSI needs to
       be no-notice or minimal-notice, the inspection program should implement a measure of
       randomness to scheduled inspections. For each certified nuclear-capable unit, one out of
 54                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


       every three full-scale NSIs should be no-notice or minimal notice. Refer to paragraph
       2.10.1
   4.5.2. Sequencing with other inspections. MAJCOMs may conduct NSIs sequentially with
   other inspections.
4.6. Limited Nuclear Surety Inspection (LNSI). The LNSI is limited in scope and does not
evaluate all NSI areas applicable to the unit. An LNSI is designed to assess sustained
performance of nuclear surety while minimizing the inspection footprint on a unit’s operations.
In order to meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the
AFIA/TI at least 60 calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 4.14.2. and
7.3.). MAJCOM/IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement
and conclusion using Attachment 4.
   4.6.1. MAJCOMs may conduct LNSIs to:
       4.6.1.1. Inspect one or more areas designated by the MAJCOM/CC or IG.
       4.6.1.2. Re-inspect MGA or sub-area(s) of a certified nuclear-capable unit that
       contributed to an overall UNSATISFACTORY or SUPPORT UNSATISFACTORY
       rating during a Defense Nuclear Surety Inspection (DNSI), NSI, or LNSI.
       4.6.1.3. Re-inspect MGA or sub-area(s) of a certified nuclear-capable unit that
       contributed to an adjectival MARGINAL or UNACCEPTABLE rating during a DNSI,
       NSI, or LNSI.
   4.6.2. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice LNSIs. (Refer to paragraph 2.10.1) Each MAJCOM
   will conduct no-notice and/or minimal-notice LNSIs and determine appropriately-sized
   teams to target specific areas of concern or interest (e.g. a planned technical operation,
   logistics movement, security exercise, etc). While LNSIs may be scheduled, no-notice, or
   minimal-notice inspections, each nuclear-capable unit will receive at least one no-notice or
   minimal-notice LNSI between each NSI. MAJCOM/IGs may conduct no-notice or minimal-
   notice LNSIs for a variety of reasons; however the LNSI does not establish a new or alter the
   existing DoD-directed NSI inspection frequency.
       4.6.2.1. MAJCOM/IGs may exempt units from this LNSI requirement if a full-scale NSI
       is conducted at least every 12 months.
       4.6.2.2. Each MAJCOM IG will ensure units not receiving an LNSI between each NSI
       will have a Memo for Record signed by the MAJCOM/CC approving/exempting the unit
       from an LNSI. This memo shall reside with SAF/IGI.
4.7. Nuclear Inspection Rating System.
   4.7.1. For INSIs, assign a Ready or Not Ready rating.
   4.7.2. For NSIs, assign overall unit ratings and MGA adjectival ratings as specified for
   NWTIs in CJCSI 3263.05 with the following exception:
       4.7.2.1. Rate unit weapons denial and recapture/recovery emergency exercise as
       ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a pass or fail rating).
   4.7.3. For LNSIs, assign overall unit ratings as specified for NSIs in CJCSI 3263.05.
   Assigning MGA adjectival ratings will be at the discretion of the MAJCOM/IG. Unless an
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                             55


   MGA was inspected to the same level/depth of a full-scale NSI, adjectival ratings should be
   limited to ACCEPTABLE, MARGINAL or UNACCEPTABLE.
4.8. Reporting Criteria. For NSIs, LNSIs, and INSIs, reports will only identify Strengths,
Deficiencies, and RIAs. RIAs will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-
compliance; they should be used to recommend a more efficient or effective course of action.
   4.8.1. Nuclear Surety Deficiencies and Corrective Actions. For reporting purposes, each
   NSI, LNSI, or INSI deficiency, as defined in CJCSI 3263.05, will:
       4.8.1.1. Be categorized as CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR as defined in CJCSI
       3263.05.
       4.8.1.2. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
       4.8.1.3. Reference the applicable instruction, technical order, or other source
       documentation.
       4.8.1.4. Address impact of continued deviation or noncompliance.
       4.8.1.5. Identify the OPR for correcting the deficiency.
       4.8.1.6. Include the OCR, if applicable.
       4.8.1.7. Provide additional comments required to explain deficiency, if applicable.
   4.8.2. Corrective Actions. See paragraph 2.16.
       4.8.2.1. Host and Tenant Deficiencies. When responsibility for corrective actions is
       assigned to both the host and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit),
       MAJCOM/IGs will communicate to ensure primary (OPR) and collateral (OCR)
       responsibility actions for deficiency resolution have properly occurred.
       4.8.2.2. Deficiencies Outside Inspected Unit’s Control. Deficiencies attributed to
       inspecting MAJCOM staff will be managed by the MAJCOM/IG using the same process
       as described in paragraph 2.16 For deficiencies outside the inspecting MAJCOM’s
       control, the supporting MAJCOM's staff and IG CARS monitor will coordinate replies
       through inspecting MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. AFIA will monitor and request updates
       from the responsible agency.
       4.8.2.3. For deficiencies from DTRA Inspections, see paragraph 4.13.2 and CJCSI
       3263.05 added instructions.
4.9. NSI Inspector Rules of Engagement (ROE).
   4.9.1. ROE #1. Inspectors will use applicable instructions, technical orders (T.O.), etc. as the
   inspection standard for the documentation, operation, process, and procedure observed or
   otherwise inspected.     Absent direct observation, authoritative documentation (e.g.
   maintenance logs) takes precedent. The IG Team Chief bases conclusions on facts collected
   through direct observation (e.g., commission or omission of an act during a technical
   operation) or authoritative documents. Inspectors may consider testimonial inputs, but
   assertions usually do not carry the same weight as direct observation or documentary
   evidence.
 56                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   4.9.2. ROE #2. No NSI compliance credit will be given after inspector intervention.
   Inspectors will intervene to ensure safety, security, and reliability of WR. When inspector
   intervention drives eventual unit compliance, the inspected unit does not earn credit for
   compliance for the purposes of the NSI.
   4.9.3. ROE #3. When determining the impact severity of missed tests/inspections, the IG
   Team Chief will consult with SMEs to determine the reliability impact of a specific
   omitted/improper test/inspection.
   4.9.4. ROE #4. IGs cannot postulate that a follow-on test(s) and inspection(s) will be
   accomplished or identify possible malfunction. IG recognizes there are follow-on tests and
   inspections that have a very high probability of detecting possible malfunctions that went
   undetected by the omitted test and inspection. However, designed-in redundancy must be
   weighed against CJSCI 3263.05, C-2.c. Regardless if all follow on tests and inspections are
   accomplished as required, IGs should not postulate the inevitability that such future tests and
   inspections would identify any malfunctions induced by defects that the omitted test and
   inspection is designed to uncover.
4.10. DOD NSI MGAs. This Instruction does not replicate the information contained in CJCSI
3263.05. The criteria below add AF-specific inspection specifications and requirements to
existing DOD criteria:
   4.10.1. Management and Administration.
      4.10.1.1. Management. Evaluate leadership, guidance, communication, and attitude of
      unit commander and key supervisors. When assessing management, consider whether
      deficiencies are the result of individual error or reflect management or supervisory
      training/experience gaps.
      4.10.1.2. Administration.
          4.10.1.2.1. Evaluate weapons loading and management to include loading
          standardization, certification, training programs and schedules. Evaluate for certain
          non-US delivery aircraft, status, certification procedures and records.
          4.10.1.2.2. Reentry system mating management to include standardization, training
          and certification programs, and maintenance plans as required.
          4.10.1.2.3. Status of approved security or safety waivers, exemptions, deviations and
          exceptions.
          4.10.1.2.4. Munitions Control. Evaluate Munitions Control in the planning,
          coordinating, directing and controlling munitions/weapons activities IAW applicable
          AFIs.
          4.10.1.2.5. Munitions/Maintenance Plans and Scheduling (P&S).           Evaluate IAW
          applicable AFIs.
          4.10.1.2.6. Evaluate the certification processes and documentation of unit
          certified/qualified personnel (e.g., aircrew and missile combat crew members)
          assigned to duties involving nuclear weapons. At a minimum, review the records of
          all personnel certified/qualified since the previous NSI. For INSIs, review a
          sufficient sample of records to achieve a 95% statistical confidence rate.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                          57


  4.10.2. Technical Operations.
     4.10.2.1. Evaluate each type of assigned weapon(s) or weapon system(s) units are tasked
     to support to assess safety, security, reliability and technical performance. These
     evaluations will be limited to those operations on which personnel are required to
     maintain certification. All record actions and reporting normally associated with the
     operation will be evaluated. MAJCOM inspectors will determine the scope and definitive
     start/stop of technical operations. In order to minimize the inspection footprint and
     mirror day-to-day unit operations, this inspection activity will evaluate unit certified
     teams performing NWTI-required technical operations with minimal QA and other unit
     leadership presence.
     4.10.2.2. For all technical operations and/or task evaluations the MAJCOM inspectors
     will brief items in paragraphs 4.10.2.2.3.1 thru 4.10.2.2.3.7. below to all personnel to be
     evaluated prior to the start of the evaluation. Units may be required to submit team
     assignment documents, duty rosters, unit committed munitions lists, maintenance
     capability letters, etc, to the MAJCOM/IG before team arrival to expedite team selection.
     Evaluate individual Career Field Education Training Plans (CFETP), Training Business
     Area (TBA), Load Training and Certification Document (AF IMT Forms 2435), PRP
     status, and work shifts when making team selections (maintain team integrity to the
     maximum extent possible).
        4.10.2.2.1. Unit assessors, QA, and weapons standardization evaluators are also
        subject to evaluation. The MAJCOM/IG may task these personnel to perform an
        evaluation of a maintenance operation within their area of responsibility. MAJCOM
        inspectors will clearly identify technical operations and/or task evaluations that
        require QA participation and evaluation of the QA function.
        4.10.2.2.2. During evaluation of any nuclear-certified procedure, the MAJCOM
        inspectors are to inspect the performance of only those individuals/team required by
        the applicable T.O. or guiding instruction for the procedure. Intervention,
        participation or influence by any other personnel (e.g., QA, Wing Weapons Officer,
        unit leadership) may be cause to terminate the procedure if, in the judgment of the
        Inspector, the outside assistance calls into question the technical proficiency or
        knowledge of the team under evaluation.
        4.10.2.2.3. As a minimum, the MAJCOM inspector task in-brief will include:
            4.10.2.2.3.1. Inspectors will stop an operation or task only after all reasonable
            opportunities to detect the deficient condition have passed or if conditions are
            detected that would jeopardize personnel or weapon safety, security, weapon
            system reliability, and/or cause equipment damage.
            4.10.2.2.3.2. All personnel who perform in process inspections (IPIs), or provide
            technical help IAW AFI 21-series guidance will be included in all evaluations.
            4.10.2.2.3.3. If required, QA or unit supervisors may observe the operation;
            however, inputs will be limited to preventing actual safety, security or reliability
            errors IAW paragraph 4.10.2.2
            4.10.2.2.3.4. If an abnormal situation presents itself and it is not covered in
58                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


            technical data, consult with your supervision. The MAJCOM inspector will
            expect a full assessment of the nature of the problem and what actions are taken to
            correct or report the problem. All sources of information will be evaluated.
            4.10.2.2.3.5. MAJCOM inspectors may review all paperwork generated as a
            result of the technical operation or task evaluations.
            4.10.2.2.3.6. MAJCOM inspectors will approve all simulations and deviations
            prior to the start of the technical operation or task to include all previously
            complied with (PCW) steps.
            4.10.2.2.3.7. MAJCOM inspectors are not on PRP, therefore, inspectors cannot
            be a part of a TWO-PERSON team. Inspectors will not intentionally violate the
            TWO-PERSON concept.
     4.10.2.3. Weapons Maintenance Technical Operations. Evaluate applicable technical
     operations designated in CJCSI 3263.05, for which the unit is tasked in their Maintenance
     Capability Letters (MCL) and Unit Committed Munitions Lists (UCML). For
     comparable operations evaluate only one weapon system type. Certain operations listed
     individually may be combined for the purpose of inspection. Inspectors will approve the
     starting and stopping configuration before the operation. Inspectors must observe
     technical operations that clearly demonstrate unit’s ability to perform its assigned nuclear
     mission. During weapons maintenance technical operations evaluate adherence to
     technical data, documentation, overall safety, security and reliability of observed
     operations, to include final assembly testing.
     4.10.2.4. Loading and Mating.
        4.10.2.4.1. Aircraft Generation/Flightline Operations. Evaluate ability to conduct a
        complete weapons upload, from initial command post message tasking to weapons
        break-out through aircrew acceptance and applicable post-load procedures. Loading
        operation must encompass each type and upload position (internal and external), as
        weapon system applicable. Loading standardization crew/weapons standardization
        load crews/squadron load crews may be evaluated. Note: For custodial units
        supporting non-US delivery organizations include the US technical load monitor
        activity.
        4.10.2.4.2. Static Loading Operations. Evaluate ability to conduct weapons
        upload/download and applicable post-load procedures. Static loading operations must
        encompass each type and upload position (internal and external), as weapon system
        applicable.       Loading standardization crew/weapons standardization load
        crews/squadron load crews may be evaluated. The environment in which static
        loading is conducted demonstrates technical proficiency and standardization of the
        weapons load crew training program. Units may simulate some aspects of security,
        entry control, approved explosive loading site plans, and/or other operations that
        cannot be reasonably conducted in a load training facility. Note: For custodial units
        supporting non-US delivery organizations include the US technical load monitor and
        associated training activities.
  4.10.3. Tools, Test, Tiedown and Handling Equipment.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            59


     4.10.3.1. AF Registered Motor Vehicles and Vehicular Equipment. Evaluate vehicle
     management control, accountability and maintenance practices for ensuring nuclear-
     certified vehicles and vehicular equipment are maintained in a safe and serviceable
     condition. Evaluate vehicle operator/using organization's ability to perform applicable
     operator's maintenance and documentation requirements on nuclear-certified vehicles and
     vehicular equipment to ensure safe and serviceable condition. Evaluate unit operator
     training and certification program to ensure compliance with applicable guidance.
     4.10.3.2. Equipment. Evaluate unit equipment management to ensure only nuclear
     certified software, testers/cables and equipment is used in support of the nuclear mission.
     Evaluate equipment is being maintained in a serviceable condition, current equipment
     calibration dates and equipment limitations/restrictions are adhered to.
  4.10.4. Condition of the Stockpile.
     4.10.4.1. Sample Size.        Examine fifty percent (50%), as a minimum, of the
     active/inactive coded assets and associated bolsters, containers, and records in igloo
     storage and at least twenty-five percent (25%) of active/inactive assets and associated
     bolsters, containers, and records in long term storage facilities and/or weapon storage
     vaults to ensure they are stored in accordance with weapons-specific T.O.s.
     4.10.4.2. Retirement Assets. Examine ten percent (10%), as a minimum, of weapons
     coded for retirement and associated records to ensure safe and secure storage in
     accordance with applicable explosive, nuclear safety and nuclear security criteria,
     weapons-specific T.O.s and retirement unit requirements contained in T.O. 11N-35-51,
     Department of Defense Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection System.
     4.10.4.3. Ensure weapons are stored in a safe and reliable configuration and in
     accordance with applicable directives. (i.e., properly grounded, chocked, immobilized.)
     Ensure weapons have proper spacing, storage compatibility, and are within explosive and
     active material limits. If defects are discovered on weapons, components or equipment
     during stockpile walkthroughs, ensure evaluation against applicable technical publication,
     technical order, or instruction and ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken and
     documented.
     4.10.4.4. Containers shall not be opened for the purpose of inspection; however, when
     the state of the item or the condition or accuracy of records is suspect, the container shall
     be opened and a visual inspection of the item and record entries made, if required. The
     determination to open containers shall be made by the NWTI Chief Inspector.
     4.10.4.5. For assets with storage bags attached sample a number of bags to ensure all
     required items are located in the storage bag and properly packaged and or sealed.
     Ensure the weapons inspection record card information matches the asset/container
     markings (P/N, Drop Numbers, S/N, ALTs, etc).
  4.10.5. Storage and Maintenance Facilities.
     4.10.5.1. Evaluate roads in storage areas, between storage and loading or missile launch
     areas.
60                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


     4.10.5.2. Evaluate nuclear-certified hoists to ensure, at a minimum, hoists are
     serviceable, authorized, and have received mandatory load testing and/or safety related
     inspections.
  4.10.6. Security.
     4.10.6.1. Evaluate unit compliance with DOD S-5210.41M_ AFMAN 31-108 and other
     required security standards for protecting WR weapons and weapon systems. Security
     inspection sub-areas and inspection methodology are depicted in Attachment 4, Table
     A4.1. Performance-based criteria, where designated, will be the primary means of the
     inspection. Compliance with existing requirements will be assessed through random
     sampling, and where practical, in conjunction with exercise events and/or task
     evaluations. Compliance with established requirements will be considered when
     determining the overall security area rating.
     4.10.6.2. MAJCOMs will supplement this section to ensure their specific operating
     environments and elements of the published Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Nuclear
     Security Threat Capabilities Assessment (NSTCA, 2005-2015) are addressed while
     ensuring safe exercise conditions to meet exercise objectives.
     4.10.6.3. Weapon Denial and Recapture Exercise Planning:
         4.10.6.3.1. MAJCOM/IGs working with their staff functional counterparts and AFIA
         will develop realistic nuclear weapon security exercise scenarios to determine a unit's
         ability to meet the Nuclear Weapons Security Standards (NWSS). The MAJCOM/IG
         team will determine the exercise scenario and coordinate scenario with DTRA during
         DNSI planning.
         4.10.6.3.2. Risk Management and safety procedures will be used in planning and
         execution of security exercises at all levels of command. When exercises are
         collocated within operational areas, care will be exercised to avoid scenarios that
         could be interpreted as an actual hostile situation that might cause accidental injury or
         illness to personnel or jeopardize the security of nuclear resources.
         4.10.6.3.3. At IG discretion, exercise scenarios resulting in the opposing force
         (OPFOR) gaining access to nuclear weapons may automatically trigger the recapture
         or recovery exercise, as applicable. Inspectors will ensure both the OPFOR and
         exercise controllers know the “adversary intentions” for the planned attack (e.g.,
         sabotage weapon, destruction, theft, etc.).
         4.10.6.3.4. All participants will apply appropriate INFOSEC and OPSEC measures to
         safeguard exercise information, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Likewise,
         the results of NSIs security exercises, or other like inspections under the auspices of
         the IG, will be appropriately classified, rated, critiqued, and reported for cross-tell
         purposes within the nuclear community.
     4.10.6.4. OPFOR Planning. Exercise scenarios will portray an OPFOR that replicates
     adversaries identified in the published DIA NSTCA. Likewise, OPFOR capabilities will
     be matched as best as possible IAW this document to evaluate the unit’s integrated effort
     to meet the NWSS. Ensure distinct separation of exercise play area from real world
     mission areas using visual identification tools (safety vest/belts, exercise controllers),
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                         61


     safety briefings for trusted agents and normal exercise Command and Control (C2)
     communication announcements. All OPFOR, exercise controllers, and IG trusted agents
     will be under the operational direction of the inspecting IG.
     4.10.6.5. Security Deviations. MAJCOM inspectors will review the number and types of
     MAJCOM-approved security deviations as well as assess the adequacy of and
     compliance with, associated compensatory measures.
     4.10.6.6. Performance-based Assessment Methodology. When measuring performance
     to determine whether a unit meets the NWSS, inspectors shall apply the following
     methodology during their observation:
        4.10.6.6.1. Observe and evaluate the integrated execution of security actions and
        responses (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable.
        Provide performance-based (Acceptable/Unacceptable) rates for exercises by
        factoring:
            4.10.6.6.1.1. The timeliness/quality/strength of security/support force responses.
            For example, did the unit meet the tenets of the NWSS (i.e., Deny access or
            regain custody?).
            4.10.6.6.1.2. Execution of applicable plans and TTPs. For example, did the unit
            make sufficient effort to immediately deny access or regain custody?
            4.10.6.6.1.3. Effect of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems,
            and other technology. For example, did the unit use available options to prevent
            the loss of/deny access to nuclear weapons to the adversary to include destruction
            of the weapon?
            4.10.6.6.1.4. Unit application of integrated base defense activities in the overall
            effort to meet the NWSS. For example, did the unit bring available resources to
            bear on the event (e.g., technology, TTPs, EOD, etc.)?
        4.10.6.6.2. Determine the effect (outcome) of executed security action(s) and
        response (performance), in conjunction with the impact of unit compliance with
        technical criteria and contribution of supporting security systems, as applicable, (see
        Attachment 4, Table A4.1) to determine if the NWSS was met. For example:
            4.10.6.6.2.1. Did the unit effectively execute applicable plans and employ
            sufficient forces in their effort to meet the NWSS?
            4.10.6.6.2.2. Was unit C2 effective?
            4.10.6.6.2.3. Did the unit up-channel information in sufficient detail and on time
            to appropriate HHQ agencies?
            4.10.6.6.2.4. Were unit TTPs and applied security technology effective in
            meeting the objective?
            4.10.6.6.2.5. Was unauthorized access denied or weapons custody regained?
        4.10.6.6.3. Modeling and Simulation. As available and applicable, the inspector may
        use computer modeling and simulation as a viable measuring tool for developing
        response force scenarios based on the published DIA NSTCA.

     management thereof per AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program.
     4.10.7.3. Assess Air Force Fire Emergency Services (FES) flights utilizing the FES
     Assessment Program (FESAP).
     4.10.7.4. Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program. Conduct a limited spot-
     check inspection of the Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program to ensure controls are in place
     and personnel practice as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) concepts when
     practical.
  4.10.8. Supply Support. Refer to CJCSI 3263.05.
  4.10.9. Nuclear Weapon Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). Evaluate PRP IAW DOD
  5210.42-R_AFMAN 10-3902. In addition to the areas listed in CJCSI 3263.05, the training
  program for all personnel who are part of the PRP shall be examined.
     4.10.9.1. PRP inspection teams should include an experienced or current certifying
     official, an experienced unit PRP monitor, and an experienced competent medical
     authority.
     4.10.9.2. Inspectors will assess the administrative qualification, certification, continuing
     evaluation, removal from PRP duties, return to duty, training and management processes,
     using record reviews and scenario-based exercises along with certifying official
     interviews to substantiate above processes, employed by the unit. PRP processes, not
     records reviews, will be the primary focus. Records reviews will be based on a 95%
     statistical confidence rate. Record review will be consistent with the time period
     established in the DODM 5210.42.
  4.10.10. Logistics Movement. Evaluate all units supporting or having responsibility for
  logistics movement of nuclear weapons by observing weapon breakout, preparation for
  shipment, transfer/transport, loading, unloading, receipt/verification and custody transfer
  procedures of representative types of weapons. The team should conduct the inspection
  (other than an INSI) during missions involving WR weapons when available. Evaluate:
     4.10.10.1. Convoy operations. Includes operational movements to or from launch
     facilities and weapon movement activities to include security support. For ICBM units,
     the capability to transfer/transport, load/unload, tiedown and transfer custody of weapons
     for payload transfer missions may be evaluated as a logistics movement.
     4.10.10.2. Explosives and active material limits. Observe compatibility of items during
     transportation.
     4.10.10.3. Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) Support. Evaluate PNAF support plans,
     security support, and logistics movement IAW applicable AFIs for PNAF certified units
     and installations supporting nuclear airlift missions. Logistics airlift units must
     demonstrate ability to safely and properly load, transport, unload, and transfer custody of
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                              63


      weapons. Note: For PNAF units, security support will be evaluated for aircrew security
      actions during the PNAF movement as required by the applicable AFIs.
4.11. AF NSI MGAs. In addition to the MGAs outlined in CJCSI 3263.05, the following
MGAs (in bold print) will also be inspected, as applicable:
   4.11.1. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Evaluate (1) classroom and practical
   training program, (2) condition of facilities and vehicles, (3) availability, serviceability, and
   demonstrated use of nuclear support equipment, (4) maintenance of technical orders,
   operating instructions, Team Chief Guides, AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health
   Record, AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and other related publications, (5) initial
   and annual certification and decertification documentation, if required, (6) knowledge of
   hazardous and classified weapons components, and (7) render safe procedures (RSP) and
   continuation of RSP.
   4.11.2. Nuclear Control Order Procedures. Evaluate CP, aircrew, Permissive Action
   Link/Code Management System lock/unlock teams, and missile crew responses to nuclear
   control orders as well as effectiveness of applicable C2 functions IAW HHQ directives.
   4.11.3. Emergency Exercises.
      4.11.3.1. Weapons Denial. Rate the weapons denial portion of this area using an
      ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (pass or fail) rating. The evaluation will also
      consider:
          4.11.3.1.1. The wing/installation's assessment of the threat and immediacy of actions
          taken during response.
          4.11.3.1.2. The effectiveness of the planning, training, and exercising of tasked
          agencies and/or activities to counter an overt attack or preparations for an overt
          attack.
          4.11.3.1.3. The use of available wing/installation resources to counter an overt attack.
      4.11.3.2. Weapons Recapture. Rate the weapons recapture portion of this area using an
      ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (pass or fail) rating. The evaluation will also
      consider:
          4.11.3.2.1. The wing/installation's assessment of the threat and immediacy of actions
          taken during recapture/recovery.
          4.11.3.2.2. The effectiveness of the planning, training, and exercising of tasked
          agencies and/or activities.
          4.11.3.2.3. The use of available wing/installation resources to recover from an overt
          attack.
      4.11.3.3. Emergency Evacuation. (USAFE Units only). Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or
      UNACCEPTABLE (a pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate unit plans and procedures to
      evacuate assets IAW command directives. The unit, as tasked by HHQ, must
      demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform and report emergency
      evacuation operations in accordance with HHQ directives.
64                                             AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


     4.11.3.4. Command Disablement. Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a
     pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate the unit’s plans and procedures to meet the primary
     objective to render weapons tactically useless and for the removal, storage, and
     destruction of specified WR components according to HHQ directives. The unit must
     demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform and report, in accordance with
     HHQ directives, command disablement actions whether tasked by HHQ or to prevent the
     unauthorized use of WR weapons should hostile forces threaten to seize them. The IG
     inspection team will provide the necessary exercise injects that would prompt command
     disablement implementation. The scope of the task evaluation may range from the
     interview of individuals with the responsibility for conducting command disablement
     operations to demonstration of procedures using training munitions.
     4.11.3.5. Emergency Response. Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a
     pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate the wing/installation's response to any emergency
     situation to determine how effectively base resources are used in areas where WR
     weapons or weapon systems may be located (e.g., in storage, in maintenance, in convoy).
     Use realistic scenarios that are based on the Local Nuclear Security Threat Capabilities
     Assessment (LNSTCA). Emergency response exercise deficiencies, strengths and
     recommended improvement areas will be taken into account for participating parties
     when determining the adjectival ratings for their respective MGA(s). (i.e., Management
     & Administration for leadership guidance and communications; Safety for compliance
     with Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSRs), Nuclear Surety Program and Nuclear
     Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program/ALARA concepts; EOD for render safe
     procedures; and Security for applicable DoD and USAF supplemented security
     requirements). Note: WR weapons will not be used in emergency exercises.
        4.11.3.5.1. Evaluate the response of tasked agencies including initial-response teams,
        disaster response force (DRF), SF, munitions/maintenance, wing safety, civil
        engineers, Emergency Management, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Fire Emergency
        Services, medical, C2, and follow-on recovery operations as the exercise scenario
        dictates. The evaluation will also consider:
            4.11.3.5.1.1. The command, control, and communications (C3) of all forces
            involved.
            4.11.3.5.1.2. The implementation of the installation emergency management and
            force protection plans, as applicable.
            4.11.3.5.1.3. Timeliness and accuracy of required reports.
            4.11.3.5.1.4. Emergency Entry to Exclusion/Limited Areas. Evaluate the
            wing/installation's ability to emergency in/out process emergency responders
            to/from exclusion and limited areas.
     4.11.3.6. An UNACCEPTABLE rating will be awarded for the Emergency Exercise area
     when:
        4.11.3.6.1. Unit response forces do not meet DOD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108
        timing criteria.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            65


          4.11.3.6.2. Unit response forces do not conduct recapture operations as specified in
          DOD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108, CJCSI 3261.01A, Recapture and Recovery of
          Nuclear Weapons, and CJCSI 3261.02A, Recapture and Recovery Response Force
          Guidance. An ACCEPTABLE grade will be based on either successful denial or
          effective and timely recapture/recovery of affected nuclear weapon(s). When initial
          denial fails and the unit is not capable of regaining custody in a timely manner, the
          overall unit rate will be UNACCEPTABLE. Failure of a unit to initially deny
          unauthorized access or subsequent loss of custody of nuclear weapons does not
          automatically result in a failing grade for exercises. In these cases, IGs must consider
          specific nuclear weapon type, site-specific physical delay/denial mechanisms, site
          topography, climate, location, and adversary objective, as well as the effort of the
          security/support force to disrupt/delay an adversary’s task and cause duress to the
          adversary as the exercise scenario plays out.
          4.11.3.6.3. Unit fails to re-establish adequate security and access control for a WR
          weapon or weapon system.
   4.11.4. Use Control. Evaluate Permissive Action Link/Code Management System,
   Command Disablement System, Positive Enable System and Active Protection System
   operations per CJCSI 3260.01B, Joint Policy Governing Positive Control Material and
   Devices, and other applicable HHQ directives.
      4.11.4.1. Award an UNACCEPTABLE rating when the unit's failure to follow
      authorized procedures for receipt, storage, control, destruction and issue of sealed
      authenticators or class 3 code management system/weapon coding equipment results in:
      loss of positive inventory control, unauthorized destruction or unauthorized issue of
      required materials; or incorrect codes/documents being positioned/installed in
      weapons/weapon control panels.
4.12. Re-inspection of NSI/LNSI Deficient Areas.
   4.12.1. When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas
   that caused or contributed to the overall UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected
   using one of the following methods, as determined by the Team Chief:
      4.12.1.1. Re-inspect Prior to Termination. The team chief may conduct an “on-the-spot”
      re-inspection prior to terminating the inspection. If the on-the-spot re-inspection
      indicates the deficiency is non-systemic and is sufficiently corrected to permit operations,
      a follow-up inspection is not required.
          4.12.1.1.1. The adjectival rating for the “on-the-spot” re-inspected area(s) will not
          exceed ACCEPTABLE. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the
          overall unit rating will be UNSATISFACTORY (Re-inspected to SATISFACTORY).
          4.12.1.1.2. Do not re-inspect prior to termination if the Team Chief determines on-
          the-spot re-inspection is inappropriate, or if:
             4.12.1.1.2.1. The failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of
             proficiency within the unit.
             4.12.1.1.2.2. Suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of
             nuclear safety, security, or reliability.
 66                                              AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


      4.12.1.2. Re-inspect After Termination. In instances where re-inspection prior to
      termination is not appropriate as determined by the Team Chief or re-inspected area(s)
      are not sufficiently corrected, the MAJCOM/IG will schedule an LNSI re-inspection NLT
      90 days from termination of the NSI.
         4.12.1.2.1. LNSI Re-inspection Rating. If all deficient areas are successfully re-
         inspected, the overall unit rating for this LNSI will be RE-INSPECTED TO
         SATISFACTORY. Assigning MGA adjectival ratings will be at the discretion of the
         MAJCOM. Unless an MGA was inspected to the same level/depth of a full-scale
         NSI, adjectival ratings should be limited to ACCEPTABLE, MARGINAL or
         UNACCEPTABLE. Document re-inspection results IAW Attachment 4 and
         forward to Table A4.2, Group 1 addressees.
4.13. Actions on Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Inspections.
   4.13.1. Throughout the conduct of DNSIs, the MAJCOM/IG team will meet with the DTRA
   team to discuss inspection activities and potential deficiencies.
   4.13.2. DNSI Reports. Units will coordinate replies to DTRA reports through their
   appropriate MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. Take corrective action based on the field report
   provided by the DTRA team at the time of the inspection.
      4.13.2.1. CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies require a description of the OPR’s
      corrective action (to include primary and, if applicable, contributing root causes) and a
      discussion of those measures or procedures initiated to preclude their recurrence. Closure
      of deficiencies requires a memorandum from the inspected unit to the MAJCOM/IG
      detailing corrective actions taken, and certification that all corrective actions are
      complete. (For DNSI reports, use CJCSI 3263.05, Encl F deficiency codes).
      4.13.2.2. The MAJCOM CARS monitor will coordinate on the MAJCOM response(s)
      and forward to AFIA/TIO with MAJCOM/IG concurrence. Corrective action response(s)
      are required within 90 days of the DNSI report date. If the corrective action report is not
      closed within 90 days of the date of the report, the MAJCOM CARS monitor will provide
      AFIA an update every 30 days on open deficiencies until the report is closed.
      4.13.2.3. AFIA will review and forward corrective action reports to DTRA
      recommending closure of deficiencies, as applicable.
      4.13.2.4. When all deficiencies are corrected, AFIA will request DTRA close the
      inspection report. AFIA will forward DTRA closure acceptance to MAJCOM/IG and
      CARS monitor.
      4.13.2.5. Deficiencies Outside Inspected Unit’s Control. Deficiencies attributed to
      inspecting MAJCOM staff will be managed by the MAJCOM/IG using the same process
      as described in paragraph 2.16 For deficiencies outside the inspecting MAJCOM’s
      control, AFIA will monitor and request updates from the responsible agency and forward
      to DTRA with the MAJCOM/IG update.
   4.13.3. Defense Nuclear Surety Oversight Inspections (DNSOI).            MAJCOM/IGs will
   courtesy copy AFIA/OV of all responses to DTRA DNSOIs.
4.14. NSI Core Team.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                             67


   4.14.1. NSI Core Team Roles. (see paragraph 7.3.1). The NSI Core Team, when fully
   manned, has 22 certified NSI inspectors assigned. Core Team members will integrate with
   the MAJCOM/IG team for all NSIs creating a single inspection unit under the direction of
   the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. When scheduling allows, NSI Core Team will have at least
   one representative for each MGA for which it is manned present at every NSI (e.g., Tech
   Ops, Security, Safety, PRP, NCOP, etc.); for INSIs and LNSIs, the Core Team make-up will
   be contingent upon the MGAs inspected.
   4.14.2. Planning. At least 60 calendar days prior to a scheduled inspection execution, the
   MAJCOM/IG Team and Core Team will begin collaboration on a draft Sequence of Events
   (SOE). For no-notice or minimal-notice NSIs/LNSIs, a tentative SOE will be drafted 60 days
   prior and finalized with the inspected unit upon formal notification.
       4.14.2.1. Ensure the SOE includes all CJCSI 3263.05 and MAJCOM NSI requirements,
       inspector task assignment (area of responsibility), and any inspection-unique
       circumstances or requirements.
       4.14.2.2. At least 15 calendar days prior to inspection execution, the MAJCOM/IG Team
       and Core Team will review and approve the inspected unit simulations and deviations
       and provide DTRA a copy when required by CJCSI 3263.05.
4.15. AF NSI Oversight Team.
   4.15.1. AF NSI Oversight Team Roles and Responsibilities. (see paragraph 7.3.2).
   4.15.2. Interaction with the Inspection Authority. During the course of the inspection,
   MAJCOM/IGs will allow AF Oversight Team members to be present for all in-briefs and
   out-briefs (including executive sessions), daily IG meetings, deficiency validation sessions
   with the inspected unit, and any discussions/validations with MAJCOM FAMs or SMEs.
   Oversight inspectors will be afforded access to all exercise areas and technical operations
   where authorized by EAL. MAJCOM/IG Team Chiefs will immediately notify the Oversight
   Team Chief of any potential CRITICAL deficiencies.
   4.15.3. Planning. The AF NSI Oversight Team may request MAJCOMs provide an
   approved SOE prior to inspection execution (e.g., INSIs).
4.16. Adjudication. Third party adjudication will occur for all types of nuclear surety
inspections when differences exist between inspecting teams and oversight teams when such
differences will affect the final overall rating of the unit. An adjudicated decision on the unit’s
overall rating will be reached before out-briefing the unit. Adjudication efforts will consult, and
may solicit inputs/positions from, all applicable resources available, within the nuclear
enterprise. Adjudication decisions will be resolved at the lowest level possible. Either the
MAJCOM/IG Team Chief or the NSI Oversight Team Chief may enter an overall unit inspection
rating into Level 1 adjudication, if needed.
   4.16.1. Level 1 Adjudication. In the event the MAJCOM/IG Team and the NSI Oversight
   Team cannot agree on an overall inspection rating, the MAJCOM/IG and AFIA/CC will
   collectively adjudicate the overall rating decision and provide that decision to the
   MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. The MAJCOM report will reflect the overall rating stemming
   from this decision, but will neither include, nor disclose, elements of disagreement between
 68                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   the teams. The MAJCOM/IG or the AFIA/CC may enter an overall unit inspection rating
   into Level 2 adjudication, if needed.
   4.16.2. Level 2 Adjudication. If a Level 1 adjudication decision cannot be reached by the
   MAJCOM/IG and AFIA/CC, TIG will adjudicate an overall rating decision and provide that
   decision to the SECAF and MAJCOM/CC. The MAJCOM/CC will communicate TIG’s
   final overall rating to the MAJCOM/IG. The MAJCOM report will reflect the overall rating
   stemming from this decision, but will neither include, nor disclose, elements of disagreement.
   The AFIA Oversight report will include the details of the adjudication effort, to include the
   dissenting opinion(s).
   4.16.3. Based on TIG and A10 (NOB Secretariat) recommendation and SECAF/CSAF
   approval, adjudication insights may be included with other IG-related issues as agenda items
   at the NOB. All adjudication decisions decided below TIG will be included as agenda items
   at the next NSI process review.
   4.16.4. In all cases, the MAJCOM/CC will retain unit certification authority.
4.17. NSI Reports and Messages.
   4.17.1. Classification and Marking. Classify and mark all NSI, LNSI, and INSI reports and
   messages IAW CJCSI 3263.05, CG-W-5, Joint DOE/DOD Nuclear Weapons Classification
   Guide, TCG-WPMU-2, Joint DOE/DOD Topical Classification Guide for Weapon
   Production and Military Use, and Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security
   Information. (Reference paragraph 2.15.)
   4.17.2. Inspection Commencement Messages. MAJCOM/IGs will send an inspection
   commencement message to all recipients in Table A4.2, Group 1 NLT 24 hours after IG
   team in-brief of the unit. Use Figures A4.1 and A4.2 as a template.
   4.17.3. Executive Summary. MAJCOM/IGs will send an executive summary to all
   recipients in Figure A4.4, Group 1 within 5 days of IG team departure from inspected unit.
   Use Figure A4.2 as a template. An executive summary is not required if the MAJCOM/IG
   publishes and distributes the final report within the same 5 days.
   4.17.4. Formal Report. Document NSI, LNSI and INSI results in a report and distribute to
   all recipients in Figure A4.4, Group 1 within 30 days of inspection outbrief of the unit.
   Distribute the report to agencies in Figure A4.4, Group 2 as necessary. MAJCOM/IGs will
   ensure agencies not included in Groups 1 or 2 but identified as OPRs for corrective actions
   are included in the report distribution.       MAJCOM/IGs will annotate in their final
   MAJCOM/IG inspection report any associated DTRA inspection or AFIA oversight
   participation.
4.18. Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspection (NORI).
   4.18.1. Purpose. The NORI is a performance-based readiness evaluation of nuclear-tasked
   units which support tasked Combatant Commanders and Joint Chief of Staff (JCS)-directed
   OPLANs. NORIs require units to demonstrate their operational capability of nuclear and
   nuclear-support in a time-constrained environment.
   4.18.2. NORI Frequency. MAJCOMs will conduct NORIs on units with nuclear delivery
   systems at intervals not to exceed 36 months. Nuclear support units will receive a NORI at
   intervals not to exceed 48 months, waiverable by MAJCOM/CC to 60 months. USAFE units
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                          69


   will conform to the NATO Strike Evaluation frequencies. MAJCOM/IGs will notify SAF/IG
   when a unit will exceed the inspection interval and will provide the anticipated inspection
   date(s).
   4.18.3. NORI Rating Scale. Wing/installation overall performance, MGAs, and sub-areas
   will be rated using the five-tier rating system of Outstanding, Excellent, SATISFACTORY,
   Marginal, and UNSATISFACTORY. USAFE may award NORI credit for successful
   completion of the NATO Strike Evaluation (STRIKEVAL). To receive NORI credit from a
   STRIKEVAL, USAFE/IG must ensure specific events are observed by inspector personnel
   either augmenting the NATO team or specifically sent to observe the events.
   4.18.4. AF NORI MGAs. The focus of the NORI is force generation, employment, and
   reconstitution (as applicable). Surety and safety should be addressed in all applicable MGAs.
   All NORI MGAs and sub-areas, to include Surety will be rated.

   4.18.5. NORI Planning. When possible for AD (and required for ARC nuclear support no-
   notice or minimal-notice), inspections should coincide with unit participation in COCOM or
   MAJCOM annual Field Training Exercises (FTX). The MAJCOM/IG will coordinate with
   applicable MAJCOM and/or NAF Exercise Programs, NAF-staff, USSTRATCOM exercise
   planners, and unit trusted agents in developing a realistic exercise scenario that fulfills
   inspection requirements. NORIs will execute to the DOC statement. Written waivers to
   deviate from DOC statement will be submitted to the MAJCOM/IG.
       4.18.5.1. For units with both a nuclear and conventional mission, the NORI may be
       scheduled in conjunction or in sequence with a CUI Phase 1 & 2 or NSI.
       4.18.5.2. If sequential inspections are conducted to assess nuclear surety, conventional
       readiness, and/or nuclear readiness, inspection objectives and criteria must be clearly
       delineated.
       4.18.5.3. If conducted sequentially, each inspection type will have an independent report.
4.19. Re-inspection of NORI Deficient Areas.
   4.19.1. When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas
   that caused or contributed to the UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected using one
   of the following methods, as determined by the Team Chief [See paragraph 4.3 for guidance
   concerning unit deficiencies and continued nuclear certification status, if applicable]:
       4.19.1.1. Re-inspect Prior to Termination. The team chief may conduct an “on-the-spot”
       re-inspection prior to terminating the inspection. If the on-the-spot re-inspection
       indicates the deficiency is non-systemic and is sufficiently corrected to permit operations,
       a follow-up inspection is not required.
          4.19.1.1.1. The adjectival rating for the “on-the-spot” re-inspected area(s) will not
          exceed SATISFACTORY. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the
          overall unit rating will be UNSATISFACTORY (Re-inspected to SATISFACTORY).
          4.19.1.1.2. Do not re-inspect prior to termination if the Team Chief determines on-
          the-spot re-inspection is inappropriate, or if:
              4.19.1.1.2.1. The failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of
              proficiency within the unit.

              4.19.1.1.2.2. Suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of
              nuclear safety, security, or reliability. If necessary, reference paragraph 4.3, for
              decertification guidance.
      4.19.1.2. Re-inspect After Termination. In instances where re-inspection prior to
      termination is not appropriate as determined by the Team Chief or re-inspected area(s)
      are not sufficiently corrected, MAJCOM/CCs will establish re-inspection timelines to
      ensure deficiencies are resolved and unit readiness to support National war plans is
      verified as soon as practical but NLT 90 days from termination of the inspection.
          4.19.1.2.1. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the overall unit rating
          will be RE-INSPECTED TO SATISFACTORY. Adjectival ratings will not be
          assigned.

                                           Chapter 5

                                JOINT BASE INSPECTIONS

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides general guidance for conducting inspections at a Joint Base
(JB) where the AF is either the supporting or the supported Component. MAJCOM supplements
to this publication will include MAJCOM-specific guidance for JB inspections within their
command.
5.2. Background.
   5.2.1. The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 law established 12 JBs and,
   simultaneously, directed the relocation of installation support functions from one Service to
   another. At some locations, the installation support is provided by other Services and the AF
   is the Supported Component. At other locations, the AF provides installation support and is
   the Supporting Component. These two variations create different approaches to inspections.
   5.2.2. A key enabler to the success of Joint Basing is the establishment of DOD-wide
   standards for delivery and common definitions of services. DOD has developed JB Common
   Output Level Standards (JB-COLS) for Joint Basing implementation. These JB-COLS
   provide common output or performance level standards for installation support, establishing
   minimum functional support requirements, regardless of which Service provides the
   installation support.
   5.2.3. This chapter outlines an effective way to conduct Service-required inspections while
   keeping Service-Level readiness and compliance considerations intact. Ultimately, any
   inspection process, regardless of which Service provides installation support, must ensure
   unit and command responsibilities are met in the context of the newly established, fully
   operationally capable JB structures.
5.3. Definitions.
   5.3.1. The “Supporting Component” is the component identified in BRAC 2005 as having
   installation support functions transferred to them from one or more supported components.
   The Supporting Component is responsible for providing installation support for the entire JB.
   For JBs with the AF serving as the lead service, all Active and Reserve AF units on the JB
   are considered part of the Supporting Component.
   5.3.2. The “Supported Component” is a component identified in BRAC 2005 as transferring
   installation support functions to another component at a JB. For JBs with the AF serving as
   the lead service, all Active and Reserve Army, Navy, Marine Corps and other non-AF DOD
   units on the JB are considered Supported Components. On non-AF led JBs, all AF is part of
   the Supported Component, Active or Reserve.
   5.3.3. A "Tenant" is defined as all DOD agencies/activities, Guard units and all non-DOD
   entities on a JB. Working Capital Fund units not performing installation management
   functions are also classified as tenants.
   5.3.4. "Installation Support" is any of the twelve categories of services and support activities.
   These are identified in the Cost Performance Visibility Framework (CPVF) quarterly. JBs
   are resourced to provide installation support to the DOD developed JB-COLS performance
 74                                                AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   standards.   Examples include Command Support, Community Services, Emergency
   Management, Environmental, Facilities Investment, Facilities Operations, Housing, Human
   Resources Management, Information Technology Services Management, Logistics Services,
   Operational Mission Services and Security Services.
   5.3.5. JB-COLS are output or performance level standards established by the DOD for
   installation support using a common framework of definitions, outputs, output performance
   metrics, and cost drivers for each installation support function. These standards provide a
   description of the capability associated with the particular installation support function.
   These output levels will apply to all DOD Components, including DOD tenants, at JBs. A
   JB, through the Joint Management Oversight Structure (JMOS), can request a deviation from
   the output level. Only a senior-level DOD function, the Installations Capabilities Council
   (ICC), is authorized to approve deviations from JB-COLS.
   5.3.6. JB Implementation Guidance (JBIG).              The BRAC 2005 Joint Basing
   recommendations require detailed guidance to ensure that DOD implements
   recommendations in a way that expeditiously achieves the optimal level of long-term
   savings, while preserving or enhancing DOD’s warfighting capabilities. The JBIG, to
   include all supplemental guidance, directs DOD Components to implement joint basing
   under a common framework. It establishes the Joint Management Oversight Structure
   (JMOS) and confirms that all installation support will be transferred to the supporting
   Component to take full advantage of the efficiencies available from consolidation. Realizing
   the unique nature of our installations, the guidance establishes a governing framework to
   justify and approve variances to the guidance, ensures all Component equities are
   represented, and expeditiously resolves challenges to the fundamental improvement in the
   management of infrastructure resources.
   5.3.7. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), in terms of JBIG, is the binding document for
   each JB that describes the organization structure, resourcing, output levels, dispute resolution
   and other agreements developed between the Components. Included in the MOA will be the
   JB Implementation Plan. The MOA, signed by the Component Vice Chiefs of Staff, defines
   the relationships between Components, and commits the supporting Component to delivery
   of the approved output levels.
   5.3.8. Inspectors must be aware that other support agreements are possible at the local level
   and fall under the following categories:
      5.3.8.1. Intra-Service agreements are AF to AF, to include AFRC and ANG.
      5.3.8.2. Inter-Service agreements are AF to other DOD Components.
      5.3.8.3. Intra-governmental agreements are AF to other non-DOD Federal activities.
      5.3.8.4. Agreements supporting AF to other non-Federal activities, excluding private or
      commercial enterprises.
5.4. Command Relationships.
   5.4.1. Base Organization and Installation Support (IS).
      5.4.1.1. A standing Joint Management Oversight Structure (JMOS) ensures fairness for
      the JB process by providing oversight of MOA compliance, dispute resolution, and
      equitable allocation of funding requirements to the responsible entities. The JMOS then
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            75


     serves as a decision chain for JB-specific performance issues, and includes service
     installation management leaders and organizations at every echelon. A JB Partnership
     Council is the foundation of the JMOS with the following key roles: Review quarterly
     CPVF reports prior to submission to OSD and Service HQs and resolve IS delivery
     issues. It does not replicate routine JB decision processes or management functions.
     5.4.1.2. Air Base Wing (ABW)/Group (ABG) or AF Element responsibilities are
     organize, train and equip functions, and apply to Airmen assigned to JBs. Organize
     responsibilities include Command Authorities IAW UCMJ, DRRS, SORTS, AEF UTC
     Reporting Tool (ART), Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) Management, Backfill
     Management, and Military Personnel Management (Performance Reports/Decorations
     and      Functional/Quarterly    Awards).         Train   responsibilities   include
     Expeditionary/Readiness Training and Force Development (Training, Education). Equip
     responsibilities include Deployment/DOC Statement Equipment and Readiness Training
     Equipment.
     5.4.1.3. The JB Commander (JBC) has the authority and responsibility for effectively
     using available resources for planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, and
     controlling the delivery of installation support as detailed in the MOA. The JBC is
     synonymous with the AF term "installation commander," and the JBC exercises the
     authority traditionally associated with the installation commander on non-JB AF
     installations. Consequently, the JBC is the commander who has authority and control
     over JB real property and is responsible for directing installation management and
     support functions IAW the MOA and the established JB-COLS requirement.
        5.4.1.3.1. There may be instances in which the JBC's authority and the authority of
        other commanders on the installation are concurrent. All supporting component and
        supported commanders retain the inherent authority to provide for the health, morale
        and welfare of their assigned personnel and for the good order and discipline of their
        units. Commanders also retain Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) authority
        and administrative control (ADCON) over military personnel under their command
        (assigned Component), regardless of whether the military personnel are being
        operationally directed by the JBC. However, unlike other commanders on the
        installation, the authority of the JBC extends to the entire installation by virtue of his
        or her position as the installation commander.             A list of authorities and
        responsibilities assumed by the JBC are set out in the MOA and in paragraph 4.1.4
        of the DOD Supplemental Guidance for Implementing and Operating a Joint Base (as
        indicated, the list is illustrative and not exhaustive).
     5.4.1.4. Business Office (BO). BOs are part of some JB developmental solutions. As
     such, the BO consolidates responsibilities for agreement management, such as an Inter-
     Service Support Agreement (ISSA). The BO does not have responsibility for any roles
     customarily assigned to a traditional AF MSG or WSAs, but is the action office (or
     supporting office) for "other duties as assigned" that may include demographic data
     gathering, significant event calendar management, Economic Impact Assessment, and the
     Joint Land Use Study.
5.5. COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS.
 76                                               AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   5.5.1. AF IGs will inspect Airmen using AF inspection requirements whether the AF is the
   supporting or supported Service at the JB. MAJCOM/IGs will inspect all Airmen, regardless
   of where they fall in the JB manning structure. When an AF supporting unit is providing
   service to an AF supported unit, the inspection standards applied stem from AFIs and their
   associated HAF Self Assessment Checklists (SAC). When an AF supporting unit is
   providing service to a supported unit from another service (Army, Navy, etc.), the inspection
   standards applied stem from JB COLs.
   5.5.2. Each JB has installation variances based on size, location, mission, etc., that make
   each compliance inspection unique. Additionally, MOAs between services, organizations,
   and entities are fluid, complicating the IG’s inspection planning efforts. In order to execute
   the most effective JB inspections across the spectrum of functional disciplines, a thorough
   inspection planning process is required. ARC units located at JBs will be notified of
   regularly scheduled inspections with a minimum one year notice.
   5.5.3. At JB locations where the AF is the supporting component, the Emergency
   Management (EM) program will be inspected IAW Attachment 3 of this Instruction. At JB
   locations where another Service is the supporting component, the owning MAJCOM will
   develop specific criteria for the lead active duty unit IAW the unit’s role (if any) in the
   installation emergency management program.
   5.5.4. Inspection Rating. Fundamentally, the AF portion of the inspection remains
   unchanged—the IG will inspect any Airman, AF process or function. The IG will inspect
   and rate each distinct unit IAW the IG’s sampling strategy. For example, at JB Lewis-
   McChord (JBLM), the 627th Air Base Group will receive a rating and the 62nd Airlift Wing
   will receive a separate and distinct rating. At JB McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), the 87th
   Air Base Wing will receive a unique rating, as will the 305th Air Mobility Wing, and the
   621st Contingency Response Wing.
   5.5.5. Any non-AF issues uncovered during the inspection that affect AF unit compliance
   will be addressed in the report and passed to SAF/IGI for resolution. SAF/IGI will work
   with the other Service IG(s) and the Intermediate Command Summit (ICS) to resolve the
   issue. The final AF report may provide a comprehensive assessment on how the other
   Service’s installation support impacts the AF mission, but it will not deliver a rating to the
   other Services.
5.6. Responsibilities.
   5.6.1. SAF/IGI. Deficiencies that negatively impact AF processes, equipment and/or
   personnel, but are not "owned" by the AF through delegation of installation support
   leadership, will be the responsibility of SAF/IGI for resolution once up-channeled by the
   MAJCOM/IG Team Chief in the IG report.
   5.6.2. MAJCOM/IG Team Chief.
       5.6.2.1. The Team Chief is responsible for final approval of the JB inspection plan.
       5.6.2.2. For deficiencies that negatively impact AF processes, equipment and/or
       personnel, but are not "owned" by the AF, the AF IG Team Chief annotates the issue(s)
       in the AF inspection report. Additionally, the Team Chief will debrief the issue(s) to
       senior AF leadership at the inspected unit, as well as the senior supporting component
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                      77


       leadership at the inspected installation. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will then forward
       the issue requiring resolution to AFIA (this process is similar to a write-up against
       another HHQ). AFIA will work with SAF/IGI to resolve the issue.
5.7. Future State. SAF/IGI will coordinate with other Service IGs to establish a joint
inspection schedule. This will maximize calendar efficiencies for the JBs and provide a more
positive, interactive and authoritative inspection.
 78                                                AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


                                           Chapter 6

                  COMMANDERS’ INSPECTION RESPONSIBILITIES

6.1. General Information. IAW 10 USC § 8583, commanders at every level have a duty to
inspect the conduct of all persons placed under their command. Commanders will inspect to
improve unit performance, military discipline, readiness, efficiency, effectiveness and quality of
life for their Airmen.

Figure 6.1. Key Questions for CCs.




6.2. Sources of Inspection Data. Inspections evaluate unit performance in relation to
established standards of readiness, compliance, and surety. The integration and analysis of
multiple sources of inspection data can provide commanders a comprehensive look at unit
performance. These sources may include, but are not limited to:
   6.2.1. Status reports (e.g., SORTS/DRRS).
   6.2.2. Wing Quality Assurance (QA) programs.
   6.2.3. Wing Standardization/Evaluation.
   6.2.4. Exercise and Evaluation Team (EET). Exercises are a valuable source of evaluation
   for a commander in determining the unit’s ability to meet mission requirements. Exercises
   provide essential feedback for a commander.
   6.2.5. Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) unit reports.
   6.2.6. PRP status meeting minutes.
   6.2.7. Personal Observations.
   6.2.8. Climate Surveys.
   6.2.9. Civil Engineer Readiness Assessments and Reports.
   6.2.10. Self-Assessment Program. Self-assessment provides commanders with a tool for
   internal assessment of unit health and complements external assessments. MAJCOMs will
   ensure self-assessment programs are established for subordinate organizations. DRUs and
   FOAs will develop and implement self-assessment programs that align with HAF intent and
   function in similar fashion as wing programs described in this Instruction.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                           79


   6.2.10. (AFISRA) Self-Assessment Program. Commanders have a responsibility to inspect
   those under their authority IAW Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section 8583,
   Requirement of Exemplary Conduct. HAF and MAJCOM functional leadership have the
   responsibility to provide policy and guidance to their functional communities. AFISRA will
   publish a Self-Assessment Program Operating Instruction and each wing/center/group will
   supplement as required. The functional community is responsible for ensuring successful
   framework (manning, policy) for organizations to operate within. Commanders will ensure
   successful execution of Self-Assessment Programs. Wings, Centers and Groups will assist in
   the development and execution of Self-Assessment Programs for their units. See
   Attachment 14 for guidance regarding self-assessment and inspection preparation.
       6.2.10.1. Commanders will appoint a Self-Assessment Program Manager at the Wing,
       Group and Squadron level. The monitor will utilize MICT to record self-assessments.
       Units will use HAF self-assessment checklists (SACs) and Deficiency Cause Codes listed
       in Attachment 7, when conducting self-assessments. Medical Quality Assurance and
       HIPAA data will not be entered into MICT unless/until MICT is certified for this data.
       FOUO, PII and classified information will not be entered into MICT.
           6.2.10.1.1. Commanders will supplement this guidance to define the roles of Group,
           Squadron and Flight Self-Assessment Program Managers.
       6.2.10.2. Problem-solving responsibility and the corrective action process reside at the
       lowest appropriate command level. Problem-solving will be applied using appropriate
       root cause analysis tools, such as the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Model as outlined in the
       AF Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) playbook.
           6.2.10.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Non-compliance issues identified during Unit Self-
           Assessments as part of the Self-Assessment Program, will be resolved by the unit
           commander with the help of the functional community. Unit leadership should
           analyze CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT and REPEAT deficiencies in the form of Root
           Cause Analysis (RCA) or the AFSO21 8-step process to identify solutions.
6.3. Responsibilities.
   6.3.1. MAJCOM/IG will:
       6.3.1.1. Inspect for compliance with 10 USC § 8583 and this Instruction.
       6.3.1.2. Work with MAJCOM/DRU/FOA leadership to identify a MICT program
       manager to assist Wings in MICT implementation, verify FAM checklist standardization.
       6.3.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) Use MICT to help assess a unit’s ability to report, analyze
       and correct deficiencies. When an inspector uncovers a unit deficiency during a CI, the
       inspector should review applicable items in MICT to assess whether the unit had already
       identified the deficiency and, if so, what actions did the unit take/plan. Units that have
       clearly reported a deficiency in MICT prior to inspector identification, to include use of
       RCA or other problem solving schemas may receive consideration by the Team Chief on
       their graded assessment.
       6.3.1.4. (Added-AFISRA) Assist AFISRA MICT FAMs in monitoring and assessing
       MICT data from wings (see paragraph 6.3.2.1) including facilitating MICT data flow
       from units.
80                                             AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


  6.3.2. HAF/MAJCOM/NGB/DRU/FOA FAM will:
     6.3.2.1. Monitor and assess MICT data from wings to maintain situational awareness of
     potential problem areas.
     6.3.2.2. Employ AFSO21 tools for large-scale corrective actions. AFSO21 tools can be
     found in the AFSO21 playbook or on the AFSO21 AF Portal website:
     https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
     af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13515C0FB5E044080020E329A
     9.
     6.3.2.3. Perform periodic reviews of AF Best Practices, MAJCOM Benchmarks,
     Continuous Process Improvement Management Tool (CPI-MT) and Joint Lessons
     Learned Information System (JLLIS) to identify and employ Enterprise or MAJCOM
     standards when appropriate.
     6.3.2.4. HAF Functionals will develop and publish in MICT a SAC with the unit-level
     compliance requirements for each AFI or AFI-mandated program. HAF Functionals may
     integrate the requirements from more than one AFI or AFI-directed program into a single
     SAC. MAJCOM/DRU/FOA FAMs will supplement HAF SACs when supplements to
     HAF guidance drive compliance by the unit. Unit Commanders may supplement
     MAJCOM supplements. SACs will be approved by the next higher HQ FAM (HAF
     approves MAJCOM, MAJCOM approves Wing, etc.). In addition, HAF and MAJCOM
     SACs will be coordinated through NGB (if applicable).
     6.3.2.4. (AFISRA) AFISRA FAMs will create standardized checklists (as required) and
     load them into MICT in accordance with Attachment 17. Wings/Centers will submit
     Wing/Center SACs to the MAJCOM FAMs for approval prior to loading into MICT.
        6.3.2.4.1. Where there is no HAF SAC for specialized MAJCOM/DRU/FOA
        functions,   MAJCOM/DRU/FOA      FAMs   may     develop  and maintain
        MAJCOM/DRU/FOA-specific SACs.
            6.3.2.4.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA FAMs will coordinate with applicable
            NGB FAMs during their annual supplement reviews. AFISRA FAMs will brief
            Directorate functional leadership on the results of their annual checklist review,
            notify AFISRA/IG (and inform wings/centers) when the review is complete,
            highlight changes, and update MICT.
        6.3.2.4.2. All SACs will indicate the degree of criticality for each self-assessment
        item (Tier 1, 2 or 3 below). All HAF Functionals will update affected SACs within
        90 days of guidance changes being posted on the AF e-Publishing website. HAF
        Functionals will review each of their SAC annually: HAF SAC review/updates will
        be conducted NLT 31 Jan with MAJCOM supplement review/updates conducted
        NLT 31 Mar; see Attachment 6 for SAC template and website information.
            6.3.2.4.2.1. SAC Timelines. HAF directorates will comply with the following
            timelines:
               6.3.2.4.2.1.1. Load SAC for each AFI, AFI-mandated program or supplement
               requiring unit compliance into the MICT database; the initial input should
               occur NLT 31 Jul 12 and annual SAC review/update will occur in accordance
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                       81


                with paragraph 6.3.2.4.2
                6.3.2.4.2.1.2. For each change to an AFI, AFI-mandated program or
                supplement requiring unit compliance, load updated SAC into the MICT
                database NLT 90 days of the publication effective date.
        6.3.2.4.3. Degrees of Criticality for SACs:
            6.3.2.4.3.1. Tier 1: Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders, or the USAF at
            risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable waste.
            6.3.2.4.3.2. Tier 2: Non-compliance degrades mission or program effectiveness
            or efficiency, and has potential, if not corrected, to create risk of mission or
            program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable waste.
            6.3.2.4.3.3. Tier 3: Non-compliance limits mission or program effectiveness or
            efficiency.
  6.3.3. The Wing Commander:
     6.3.3.1. Will establish and maintain a Self-Assessment Program IAW this AFI and chain
     of command guidance.
     6.3.3.2. Will establish a frequency for the Self-Assessment Program to enable adequate
     awareness by the command chain of the wing’s readiness, compliance and surety.
     6.3.3.3. Will ensure subordinate organizations (i.e., Group, Squadron) establish and

       6.3.5.7. Utilize MICT to develop appropriate reporting tools to meet the needs of wing
       leadership.
6.4. Future State:
   6.4.1. In Nov 2011, CSAF directed SAF/IG and COMUSAFE to develop and implement a
   new inspection system across USAFE, for possible AF-wide implementation at a later date.
   The guidance for this new system is contained in a separate Guidance Memorandum and is
   for USAFE only. The USAFE system will give wing commanders manpower, training and
   guidance to create an organic inspection capability. As this wing-level inspection capability
   is developed into a mature, trusted component of the AF Inspection System, MAJCOM/IGs
   will increasingly shift their focus away from Compliance Inspections to Unit Effectiveness
   Inspections (UEI), validating and verifying the wing’s own ability to find, fix, report and
   track deficiencies to closure.

assessments and support to improve readiness, discipline and efficiency, to include: oversight of
NSIs; process improvement facilitation and support for AFSO21 initiatives; conducts inspections
of DRUs and FOAs; and conducts AF HSIs. (see paragraph 1.5.3).
7.2. Management Inspection (MI). An MI is an inspection above wing level that assesses the
efficiency, effectiveness, economy, and discipline of organizations, activities, or programs based
on the fundamental principles of well-managed organizations. An MI uses a five-tier rating
system that measures the seven major graded areas discussed below.
   7.2.1. Execution. MIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well as
   management functions above the wing level against the fundamental principles of well-
   managed organizations.
   7.2.2. MI Rating. Overall management performance and management MGAs will be rated
   using the five-tier scale OUTSTANDING, EXCELLENT, SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL,
   and UNSATISFACTORY. This tier system will be the same whether inspecting an
   organization, agency, FOA, DRU or an AF-level program.
   7.2.3. AF Management Inspection MGAs.
       7.2.3.1. Strategic Planning. Strategic planning is an organization’s process of defining

          7.2.3.7.3. Assess the organization’s outcomes to ensure they satisfy their own
          strategic goals/objectives.
          7.2.3.7.4. Assess if the organization is functioning within its authority, doing work
          outside its scope, duplicating a role of another organization or section internal to itself
          and if the work could be more efficiently accomplished by another organization.
7.3. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI).
   7.3.1. AF NSI Core Team (AFIA/TIN). A core team of certified NSI inspectors centralized
   at AFIA will integrate with the MAJCOM/IG Teams on all scheduled and no-notice NSIs
   used to operationally certify and verify nuclear-capable units. The Core Team will also
   support NSI re-inspections and select LNSIs and INSIs. See paragraph 4.14
      7.3.1.1. The Core Team provides expertise across various nuclear surety MGAs as
      outlined in Chapter 4. The Core Team will support NSIs across the nuclear-capable
      MAJCOMs (AFGSC, AFMC, AMC and USAFE).
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            85


     7.3.1.2. The Core Team will combine with the MAJCOM/IG Team to form a single unit,
     under the direction of the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief
     retains the authority as the on-scene director and is responsible for determining the
     inspection grade and completing the inspection report to the MAJCOM/CC. The Core
     Team will provide the Deputy Team Chief.
     7.3.1.3. Primary objectives of the Core Team are to improve standardization of NSIs,
     elevate the MAJCOM/IG Team’s inspector experience and expertise and contribute to
     NSI lessons learned and trend analysis processes. Additionally, Core Team members will
     support the semi-annual NSI process review, the NSI inspector training and certification
     program, applicable conferences and meetings held throughout the nuclear enterprise,
     and/or duties assigned by AFIA/CC.
     7.3.1.4. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief and the Deputy Team Chief from the Core Team
     are responsible for developing full team complement consisting of permanent party, Core
     Team members, and required SME augmentees.
  7.3.2. AF NSI Oversight Team.               AFIA/OV provides oversight assessments to
  MAJCOM/CCs and TIG on the consistency of MAJCOM NSIs. Conducts in-depth trend
  analysis, assesses the sufficiency of corrective actions to inspection deficiencies and provides
  deficiency status and metrics to personnel in the AF nuclear surety arena. See paragraph
  4.15
     7.3.2.1. The Oversight Team will not perform inspections but has the authority to
     intervene in an inspection for reasons of safety or critical non-compliance.
     7.3.2.2. Acts as the AF clearinghouse for MAJCOM responses to DTRA Nuclear
     Weapon Technical Inspection deficiencies.         AFIA/OV reviews CRITICAL and
     SIGNIFICANT nuclear surety deficiencies identified in DTRA inspection reports and
     requests clarification of deficiencies. AFIA/OV also reviews MAJCOM actions taken to
     correct these deficiencies and endorses them to DTRA. In cases where AFIA or DTRA
     non-concurs, AFIA/OV returns corrective action responses to MAJCOM for clarification.
     Seeks consultative assistance from AFSC/SEW as needed.
     7.3.2.3. Provides nuclear surety-related oversight of MAJCOM-conducted NSIs, LNSIs
     and select INSIs, to include re-inspections and no-/minimal-notice NSIs and LNSIs.
     Additionally, provides observer(s) when the Defense Threat Reduction
     Agency/Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (DTRA/CSNI) inspects AF
     units under the auspices of CJCSI 3263.05. AFIA will coordinate each NSI visit with the
     respective MAJCOM/IG Gatekeeper and will honor the IG trusted agent system to
     protect the minimum or no-notice aspect of the inspection. In the course of directly
     observing MAJCOM inspectors conducting their activities, AFIA/OV team members will
     not intervene in the inspection process unless the safety, security, or reliability of a
     weapon is in jeopardy, or injury to personnel, and the MAJCOM inspectors fail to take
     appropriate actions to correct the situation.
         7.3.2.3.1. Upon inspection conclusion, the AFIA Oversight Team Chief will provide
         a separate non-collaborative report, routed through AFIA/CC and TIG to SECAF,
         MAJCOM/CC and MAJCOM/IG. The report provides an assessment of the
         MAJCOM/IG team and their conduct of the inspection, and an independent
86                                              AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


        perspective of the inspected unit's nuclear surety. Specific areas to be addressed in
        each report include:
            7.3.2.3.1.1. Concurrence or non-concurrence with the MAJCOM/IG assessment
            of nuclear surety.
            7.3.2.3.1.2. Contentious issues (include areas requiring level 1 or 2 adjudication,
            reference paragraph 4.16).
            7.3.2.3.1.3. Composition of the qualification and training of MAJCOM
            inspection team.
            7.3.2.3.1.4. Use of current AF and MAJCOM checklists and inspection guides as
            per paragraph 1.5.7.4
            7.3.2.3.1.5. Implementation and understanding of policy and guidance.
            7.3.2.3.1.6. Adequacy of MAJCOM/IG validation.
            7.3.2.3.1.7. Sufficiency of MAJCOM/IG report.
            7.3.2.3.1.8. Sufficiency of MAJCOM/IG team’s deliberative process.
     7.3.2.4. Coordinates the proposed DTRA NSI inspection schedule for AF units.
     7.3.2.5. AFIA Inspection Observations. AFIA will observe MAJCOM/IG teams
     conducting inspections (all types) and provide feedback to the MAJCOM/IGs and
     SAF/IG. Feedback is derived from over-the-shoulder observation of inspection planning
     (when able), and execution focusing on the quality, standardization, objectivity,
     thoroughness and conduct of the MAJCOM/IG team.
        7.3.2.5.1. Inspection observations will be administered by AFIA/OV and should be
        no-notice. AFIA/OV will selectively determine which inspections to observe with the
        goal of providing each MAJCOM/IG feedback across the spectrum of inspection
        activity over a 24-month period.
            7.3.2.5.1.1. Observation teams should have a minimal footprint and be
            nonintrusive into the MAJCOM inspection process unless safety or security are
            jeopardized.
            7.3.2.5.1.2. AFIA Oversight Team Chief will brief the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief
            of the AFIA role in the inspection process during the inspection inbrief.
            7.3.2.5.1.3. AFIA Observation members should be present at the MAJCOM/IG’s
            daily team meeting/event recap unless actively observing MAJCOM/IG
            inspectors.
            7.3.2.5.1.4. AFIA Observation Team Chief (or representative) should be present
            at all MAJCOM/IG Team Chief briefs and meetings with the Unit Commander.
            7.3.2.5.1.5. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will provide the AFIA Observation
            Team Chief a draft copy of their inspection report prior to the unit outbrief.
        7.3.2.5.2. AFIA/OV will provide an observation report for each observed inspection
        within 30 days of the inspection outbrief. The report will be approved by the
        AFIA/CC and provided to SAF/IG and MAJCOM/IG. The report will provide
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                           87


           feedback on the MAJCOM/IG team planning and performance in the conduct of the
           inspection. The report will not contain AFIA’s assessment of the inspected unit’s
           compliance with policy or readiness posture, but may comment on AFIA observations
           related to significant unit non-compliance with policy or readiness deficiencies that
           the MAJCOM/IG team does not identify or address.
7.4. DRU and FOA CIs. AFIA/TIC conducts CUIs of the Air Force District of Washington
and the United States Air Force Academy IAW Chapters 1, 2 and 3. However, AFIA/TIC
conducts CIs only for all the other AF-level DRUs and FOAs IAW Chapters 1 and 2 and the
paragraphs below.
   7.4.1. Inspection Scope. These inspections will be conducted on either a scheduled or a no-
   notice basis at an interval of no more than 24 months. SAF/IG approval is required to exceed
   the 24-month inspection interval. All applicable areas from Attachment 3 (CUI Ph 0
   column) will be inspected at each unit, grouped into appropriate MGAs. Inspected units may
   rely on host wing support for management of some programs. Since the host wings are
   subject to inspection by their own MAJCOM, AFIA will not inspect the host; however, AFIA
   will assess the adequacy of host wing support to the inspected unit. On the other hand, if
   program support is provided by a FOA’s parent organization, the program management by
   the parent is subject to inspection by AFIA.
   7.4.2. Reports and Follow-up. Official reports will be published on the final day of the
   inspection, directly following the commander’s outbrief.
   7.4.3. CI Re-inspection. Units receiving an overall rating of UNSATISFACTORY during a
   CI will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 6 months. SAF/IG approval is required to
   exceed the 6-month re-inspection interval. Only MGAs receiving a MARGINAL or
   UNSATISFACTORY will be re-inspected.
7.5. HSI. HSIs assess the functioning and execution of AF Medical Service (AFMS) programs
and processes at the local level in order to provide senior leadership with accurate data upon
which to base policy decisions. HSIs also assess the ability of AF medical units to fulfill their
health service support missions by providing required capability, including provision of medical
care, success in training and equipping deployable personnel, and support of the host wing
mission.
   7.5.1. Criteria and Inspection Guides. HQ AFIA/SG, in collaboration with HAF, AFMSA
   and AFMOA functional SMEs, derives criteria from health care policies of the Office of the
   Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (SAF/IE), the office of the AF/SG,
   MAJCOM SG, OSHA public Law, various civilian medical oversight agencies [such as the
   Joint Commission and the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care
   (AAAHC)], the NGB, and the AFRC. Air Force Inspection Agency, Medical Operations
   Directorate (AFIA/SG), based on changes in health care policies, regulatory guidance and
   coordination with AF/SG, NGB/SG and AFRC/SG staffs, annually updates the next year’s
   inspection guide and posts to the AFIA SharePoint site. Inspectors assess sustained
   performance by reviewing substantiating documents created since the last inspection.
       7.5.1.1. Certification.   Comply with applicable portions of paragraph 2.4.1 and its
       subparagraphs.
88                                              AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


  7.5.2. Ratings. Each medical unit receives an overall rating of OUTSTANDING,
  EXCELLENT, SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL, or UNSATISFACTORY.
  7.5.3. HSI Frequency. HSIs will occur with CUIs (see Chapter 3).
     7.5.3.1. AD medical units update their demographics whenever they become aware of an
     event that may affect the scheduling process. AD bedded medical units must update their
     electronic Joint Commission application upon notification from The Joint Commission,
     which occurs 15 months prior to their anniversary date. Significant changes should be
     reported to the Joint Commission within 30 days of change. The Joint Commission also
     requires an annual self-assessment Periodic Performance Review (PPR) via electronic
     submission. Notification for e-application and PPR submission requirements are
     provided per email to the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) CC 15 months prior to the
     accreditation anniversary date. AD non-bedded medical units must submit a new
     application with AAAHC which must be received no later than 90 days prior to their
     reaccreditation survey date. During the term of accreditation, AAAHC also requires
     written notification within 30 days of any significant organizational, operational or
     financial changes that can occur.
         7.5.3.1.1. MAJCOM IGs contact the AFIA Gatekeeper for HSI scheduling concerns
         according to MAJCOM-specific notification procedures.
         7.5.3.1.2. MTFs requesting postponement/re-schedule of a scheduled AD inspection
         must be forwarded to AFIA/SG for approval following Wing CC (or equivalent),
         MAJCOM/IG, MAJCOM SG coordination and AF/SG concurrence. MTFs should
         allow sufficient time to process and coordinate postponement requests ensuring
         AFIA/SG has appropriate information to make a decision to approve/disapprove the
         request.
     7.5.3.2. ARC units are inspected on average every 48 months not to exceed 60-months
     from the date of the last HSI. AFIA/SG publishes a calendar year ARC HSI schedule in
     coordination with AFRC/IG/SG and NGB/IG/SG. In keeping with AF policy regarding
     inspection footprint, AFIA/SG will, to the greatest extent possible, schedule medical unit
     HSIs simultaneously with other scheduled wing inspections and assessments (e.g., CI,
     ASEV). Unit requests for postponement/re-schedule of a scheduled ARC or AES HSI
     must be forwarded to AFIA/SG following MAJCOM coordination and policies. Units
     should allow sufficient time to process and coordinate postponement requests ensuring
     AFIA/SG has the time and appropriate information to make a decision to
     approve/disapprove the request. ANG Medical Groups are the medical force provider for
     CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Packages (CERFP). These medical elements have a
     separate, joint mission within their state and may not drill with or participate in MDG
     activities. CERFP training requirements are delineated in AFI 41-106. Host MDG is
     responsible for maintain credentials and training documentation. Otherwise, the CERFP
     Medical element should be considered a separate entity for HSI purposes. Note: For
     purposes of this Instruction, NGB/SG is a MAJCOM equivalent.
     7.5.3.3. Certain events or circumstances may affect inspection scheduling for AD and
     ARC units. Follow the guidance listed in Chapter 3 of this Instruction.
     7.5.3.4. Follow-up inspections.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                           89


          7.5.3.4.1. All units receiving an overall rating of “Unsatisfactory” or “Marginal”
          during an HSI will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 18 months or for ARC
          units not to exceed 24 months. The unit’s rating for a re-inspection will be capped at
          a “SATISFACTORY” rating.
              7.5.3.4.1.1. The MAJCOM SG or equivalent will conduct a staff assistance visit
              within six months to assess status. This report will be forwarded to AFIA/SG.
          7.5.3.4.2. For ARC and ARC AE units, the next scheduled HSI will be conducted in
          conjunction with the next scheduled CUI not to exceed 60 months from the date of
          the initial unsatisfactory/marginal HSI.
   7.5.4. Reports and Follow-up Responses. An electronic and/or paper copy HSI report will
   be included in the overall IG report and left with the unit CC at the conclusion of the
   inspection. A final copy is distributed to AF/SG, MAJCOM/SG, SAF/IGI and other
   interested staff agencies after review at AFIA.
       7.5.4.1. “Critical” and “Programmatic Failure” (Scores of 0 and 1) assessments for all
       units require a response (close-out or interim update) within 3 months of the inspection.
       These assessments are expected to be completely resolved within 12 months. Units are
       required to provide follow-up replies, including estimated completion dates, every 90
       days until closure to their respective MAJCOM/SGs (or equivalent) IAW instructions
       outlined in the HSI final report.
       7.5.4.2. “Critical” and “Programmatic Failure” (Scores of 0 and 1) assessments for ARC
       units and AESs require a response (close-out or interim update) within 6 months of the
       inspection. Units are required to provide follow-up replies, including estimated
       completion dates, every 3 months until closure to their respective MAJCOM/SGs IAW
       instructions outlined in the HSI final report. These assessments are expected to be
       completely resolved within 12 months.
       7.5.4.3. MTF or ARC medical units or AE Squadrons with assessments of "CRITICAL"
       or "Programmatic Failure" (Scores of 1 or 0) in any element, or assessments of "MAJOR"
       (Score of 2) in any element that is a repeat deficiency from the previous HSI will conduct
       AF 8-Step Problem Solving as outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook, determining root-
       causes and countermeasures to deficiencies. AF 8-Step Problem Solving documentation
       (preferably in AFSO21 A3 template) will be forwarded within 90 days for Active-Duty
       units and 6 months for ARC units and AESs to their respective MAJCOM/SGs (or
       equivalent), who will track and provide follow-up guidance until resolution. Once
       resolved, informational copies of the problem solving documentation will also be sent by
       units to AFIA/SG.
   7.5.5. Special Emphasis Items (SEI). SEIs are limited studies performed during HSIs whose
   purpose is to gather information on specific issues. Topics to be researched are submitted by
   field or HQ personnel to AFIA/SG for approval/disapproval. SEIs are normally terminated
   within 6-12 months, and the results are briefed at the annual IG-SG Annual Review. There
   should be no more than 3 active SEIs at one time.
7.6. Field Inspection. As applicable, these inspections provide SAF/IG credible, independent
assessments of AF operational readiness, efficiency, discipline, morale, economy, and
effectiveness, as well as assist in oversight of the AF inspection system.

   7.6.1. IG Team Augmentation. On request, AFIA inspectors may augment MAJCOM/IG
   teams during inspections of field units. AFIA augmentees do not write a separate report.
   Rated inspectors with current medical and physiological training prerequisites may fly as
   observers in unit aircraft when appropriate to their inspection role.
   7.6.2. Contingencies and Combat. AFIA inspectors may deploy to forward locations and
   field HQs during contingency and/or combat operations to observe processes and recommend
   solutions to readiness problems beyond the control of the local AF field commander. These
   visits require approval by the appropriate unified command. This is not an inspection, but is
   an opportunity for an independent and impartial AF-level team to analyze systemic readiness
   problems that may need HAF or higher-level attention. Refer also to War Mobilization Plan,
   Volume 1, Annex O.
7.7. Inspector General Directed Investigation (IGDI). An IGDI is a high-priority
investigation directed by TIG. These investigations are usually time sensitive and deficiencies
and recommendations are of significant interest to the AF, members of Congress, or the general
public. TIG approves all requests for IGDIs.
7.8. The AFIA MI and Analysis Division. Will collect, monitor, analyze and report on key
inspection data from across the USAF and compile the data into meaningful information to
support Air Force Senior Leader decision making.
   7.8.1. Support SAF/IG with analysis for SECAF/CSAF level briefings.
   7.8.2. Provide AF wide inspection analysis for Air Force Enterprise Dashboard.
   7.8.3. Collect Root Cause Analysis (RCA) data from the MAJCOMS for analysis.
   7.8.4. Report on inspection trends to SAF/IG and other Senior leaders across the Air Force.
7.9. TIGIRS Lead Command. Acts as Lead Command for all components of the TIGIRS
family of systems. At this time those components are IGEMS, MICT and AFICS.
   7.9.1. Develops, validates, prioritizes and documents all requirements for each component.
   Provides all requirements to the TIGIRS Program Office (AFPEO EIS/HIBI).
   7.9.2. Monitors the activities of the TIGIRS Program Office to modify, sustain and support
   each component.
   7.9.3. Acts as the single voice of the customer to communicate and represent user issues and
   concerns to the TIGIRS Program Office.
   7.9.4. Directs the operational testing of upgrades to each TIGIRS component.
   7.9.5. Manages the TIGIRS program, to include reporting status to AFIA/PI, AFIA/CC and
   SAF/IG; identifying and resolving program issues; and identifying and programming for the
   resources required to support the upgrade and sustainment of each component.
7.10. TIG Brief Magazine. AFIA publishes TIG Brief (Air Force Recurring Publication
[AFRP] 90-1) which provides authoritative guidance and information to CCs, IGs, inspectors,
and AF supervisors and leaders at all levels of command. Anyone may submit articles to
AFIA/PI. Articles should relate to anticipated or actual problems, recommendations to improve
management, safety, security, inspection or operational techniques, cross tell of lessons learned,
best practices, or contemporary issues of interest to the AF.

                                           Chapter 8

                   IG FORCE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT

8.1. Air Force Inspector General Duty. IG duty is a position of high public trust. Personnel
selected for an Air Force Inspector General assignment are functional experts selected from Air
Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) across the Air Force. They possess attributes of the highest
professional standards and moral character; demonstrate potential for future service and
continued promotion; and provide credibility for those Airmen, family members, and civilians
who seek IG assistance. In addition to these qualities, Airmen selected for IG service will:
   8.1.1. Be senior captains (captains with more than 7 years commissioned service) or above
   or civilian equivalent. Enlisted inspectors must be TSgt 7-level or above. Waivers may be
   granted by the MAJCOM/CC on a case-by-case basis if qualified candidates are not
   available. Report all waivers to SAF/IGI to enable assessment of the effectiveness of IG
   force development processes. MAJCOM NSI inspector positions may be Key Nuclear Billet
   based on the requirement for experienced nuclear enterprise expertise that can immediately
   be effective upon assignment. Additionally, NSI inspector positions should have the highest
   assignment priority for continuity of the NSI inspector position.
   8.1.2. Have broad, contemporary Air Force assignment experience and background that
   reflects outstanding performance. NSI inspectors must have nuclear experience or experience
   applicable to current systems in their respective MAJCOM prior to assignment as an
   inspector. All nuclear munitions inspectors will have prior nuclear maintenance experience.
   8.1.3. Display moral attributes and personal traits that demonstrate adherence to Air Force
   Core Values.
   8.1.4. Be able to attain and hold a security clearance commensurate with the duties required
   as an IG inspector.
   8.1.5. Have no record of civil conviction except for minor offenses.
   8.1.6. Have no record of punishment under Article 15: Uniform Code of Military Justice;
   conviction by court-martial; general officer letters of reprimand filed in the official military
   personnel file.
   8.1.7. Present good military bearing and appearance.
   8.1.8. Meet Air Force fitness standards.
8.2. Inspector General Team Chiefs. Colonel/Civilian equivalent Inspector General Team
Chiefs will be nominated and selected by the MAJCOM/CC. Lt Col/Civilian equivalent Team
Chiefs will be selected by the IG with the concurrence and assistance of the MAJCOM/CC.
8.3. Inspector General Force Development (FD). SAF/IG will establish an IG Advisory Panel
(IGAP) IAW AFI 36-2640, Executing Total Force Development. The IGAP will generate and
implement FD and management strategies to sustain and improve IG capabilities. The panel will
further provide advice, guidance and assistance to Career Field Managers (CFMs) and
Development Teams (DTs) on how best to develop and employ Airmen to deliver desired IG
capabilities. The IG Force Development Advisory Panel will:

   8.3.1. Provide desired inputs for affected DTs/CFMs NLT 30 calendar days prior to each
   scheduled DT session. Advisory panel inputs must include a summary of the requirement, to
   include the grade, AFSC, experience level, and number of valid personnel authorizations that
   must be filled.
   8.3.2. Attend and provide inputs to the Force Management and Development Council.
   8.3.3. Annually review and approve IG Basic and Nuclear Inspector training courses.
   8.3.4. Provide advice to IGs on Officer and Enlisted development and assignment
   opportunities, as well as assignment selection criteria for Enlisted Equal Plus advertisements.
8.4. Inspector General Training. Inspector General training and certification is vital to ensure
the experience criteria necessary to develop a sufficient professional IG cadre. All IG Airmen
will be familiar with the appropriate training required within their AFSC series or career area,
complete appropriate education and training commensurate with their grade, and develop
proficiency of occupational and institutional competencies commensurate with their grade to
enhance their IG duty performance. All members are responsible for using resources to become
aware of opportunities for development and advancement after leaving the IG.
   8.4.1. Senior IG Personnel Training. MAJCOM/IGs will attend the 1-day Executive IG
   Course at the Pentagon within 60 days of being appointed. MAJCOM/IG Deputies and
   MAJCOM/IG Superintendents may attend at the discretion of the MAJCOM/IG.
   MAJCOM/IGs, Other IG senior officers, civilian equivalents and senior NCOs must be
   nominated by their MAJCOM/IG in order to attend on a space-available basis.
   MAJCOM/IGs will submit requests for training to SAF/IGI.
   8.4.2. Mandatory Training. All permanent party AFIA, MAJCOM and Wing Inspection
   IG team members will complete the USAF Basic Inspectors Course within 90 days (180 days
   for ARC) of assignment to an IG position. All permanent party AFIA, MAJCOM and Wing
   Inspection IG team members that complete NWTI will complete the USAF Nuclear
   Inspectors Course within 180 days of assignment to an IG team. Additionally, PRP medical
   inspectors are required to complete the AFMS Medical PRP Course within 180 calendar days
   after assuming inspector duties. MAJCOM/IG inspector augmentees will receive proper
   education and training equivalent to the mandatory inspector courses prior to assuming duties
   as an inspector augmentee. While designed and required for newly assigned MAJCOM/IG
   team members, other MAJCOM/unit-level inspectors and Wing Inspection Team (WIT)
   members may attend both courses on a space-available basis. Additional information
   regarding the Inspectors Course may be obtained from the AFIA SharePoint/Inspector
   Management Site; https://cs.eis.af.mil/afia/TI/default.aspx.
       8.4.2.1. AFIA/TII will post a yearly schedule in the SharePoint/Inspector Management
       Site NLT 1 Sep each year for the USAF Basic Inspector Course and Nuclear Surety
       Courses. For special circumstances (i.e., Mobile Training Team for either course) contact
       the TII Division Chief. AFIA inspector training can be found at the AFIA
       SharePoint/Inspector                            Management                          Site;
       https://cs.eis.af.mil/afia/TI/afiaic/Lists/Inspector%20Course%20Events/Active%20
       Courses.aspx
       8.4.2.2. AFIA Instructors will train and certify designated MAJCOM/IG inspectors to
       teach the Air Force Basic Inspectors' Course. MAJCOM/IG instructors will administer
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            93


     the Air Force Basic Inspectors' Course to Wing/IG team members. AFIA will perform
     periodic audits of MAJCOM/IG training as required. To ensure currency and
     standardization in training, AFIA will provide updated training materials to all
     MAJCOMs (as required); certified MAJCOM/IG instructors are responsible for ensuring
     they are using current training materials.
     8.4.2.3. MAJCOM/IG Instructors may utilize a video-teleconferencing or Direct Connect
     Online (DCO) means to conduct Basic Inspectors Course training.
  8.4.3. MAJCOM/IG-Specific Training. MAJCOM/IGs will develop and provide all
  required specialized team, functional area, host-nation, or MAJCOM-specific training to
  augmentees as required.
  8.4.4. For required inspector training prior to assessing contractor functions, IG Team Chiefs
  will ensure inspectors complete training IAW the following guidance:
     8.4.4.1. Inspectors may receive Contracting Officer’s Representative training IAW
     AFFARS Mandatory Procedure 5301.602-2 (d), Designation, Assignment, and
     Responsibilities of a Contracting Officer’s Representative. MAJCOMs will document in
     their supplement to this AFI if additional contract-specific training is required. Additional
     on-line training shall consist of the following courses:
         8.4.4.1.1. Defense Acquisition University (DAU) CLC106, “COR (Contracting
         Officer Representative) with a Mission Focus”, available on-line at:
         https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnow/default.asp?page=main.asp.
         8.4.4.1.2. DAU COR 206, COR in a Contingency Environment (when applicable),
         available                             on-line                           at:
         https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnow/default.asp?page=main.asp.
         8.4.4.1.3. Continuous Learning Modules (CLM) 003, Ethics Training For
         Acquisition     Technology    and     Logistics,   available  on-line at:
         https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnow/default.asp?page=main.asp.
         8.4.4.1.4. Inspectors performing EMS audits must successfully complete EMS Lead
         Auditor training. This training can be satisfied through AFIT's WENV 350
         Environmental Management Systems Auditing Course or from commercially offered
         US Registration Advisory Board (RAB) certified ISO 14001 lead auditor training
         courses.
     8.4.4.2. The ESOHCAMP inspectors should be qualified in their respective areas of
     expertise. A MAJCOM or FOA member of the Safety Office will be considered
     qualified in their respective areas. The Environmental programs will be evaluated by a
     MAJCOM or FOA member of the Environmental Function who also has completed
     Environmental management Systems auditor training. Occupational health programs will
     be evaluated by either a certified industrial hygienist or fully qualified Bioenvironmental
     Engineer (43E3). If base level personnel are used to support an inspection they must be
     approved by the MAJCOM Safety, Surgeon or Civil Engineering office respectively in
     addition to the above AFSC and training requirements.
  8.4.5. Recurring Training. All AF inspectors will accomplish mandatory refresher training
  every 48 months after certification, to include, AFIA, MAJCOM/IG, and Wing/IG inspectors
 94                                                  AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   and those inspector augmentees who augment AFIA and MAJCOM/IG and Wing IG teams.
   Those inspectors who do not inspect on a regular basis (i.e., at least two inspections annually,
   not including field observation training) will re-accomplish the basic inspector course.
   MAJCOM/IGs may provide refresher training with an AFIA-approved course. Recurring
   training does not require field observation by a certified inspector.
   8.4.6. Optional Training. NSI Inspectors are highly encouraged to attend other nuclear
   and/or inspection courses to add breadth and depth to their nuclear experience.
8.5. Inspector General Certification. See paragraph 2.4.1 and its sub-paragraphs.
8.6. Civilian Inspector General Requirements. In accordance with civilian personnel rules
and regulations, commanders or command IGs may hire Air Force civilians to serve as IG
personnel. Hiring authorities must ensure that these employees, like their uniformed
counterparts, understand the nature of IG work. MAJCOM/IGs must understand that civilian
employees who perform IG duties have access to sensitive and confidential IG information and
hold a position of high public trust. To protect those who seek assistance from the IG and to
safeguard the integrity of the IG system, civilian employees performing IG duties must display
moral attributes and personal traits that demonstrate adherence to Air Force Core Values.
   8.6.1. During the hiring process, hiring authorities will screen potential civilian employee
   candidates, to include current IGs applying for another IG position. These elements will be
   incorporated into hiring announcements and civilian position descriptions. Failure to
   maintain attributes in paragraphs 8.6.2.4, 8.6.2.5 and 8.6.2.6 below will serve as grounds for
   revocation of IG certification, credentials, and possibly termination from government service.
   8.6.2. Civilians selected for Inspector General Inspections duty will:
       8.6.2.1. Be a citizen of the United States.
       8.6.2.2. Be in the grade of GS–11 or above. Team Chiefs will be in the grade of GS-13
       or above.
       8.6.2.3. Have broad, contemporary Air Force experience and background that reflects
       outstanding performance. Civilian NSI inspectors must have prior nuclear experience.
       Civilians inspecting technical operations will also be required to have a nuclear munitions
       background. This experience is crucial to gain and maintain credibility with Airmen and
       civilians when conducting IG functions.
       8.6.2.4. Display moral attributes and personal traits that demonstrate adherence to Air
       Force Core Values.
       8.6.2.5. Be able to attain and hold a security clearance commensurate with the duties
       required as an IG inspector.
       8.6.2.6. Have no record of civil conviction except for minor offenses.
8.7. Future State.
   8.7.1. 1 Wear of Inspector General Insignia. This policy is under development and awaiting
   approval by SECAF and CSAF.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                            95


                                 Chapter 9 (Added-AFISRA)

                            AFISRA - SPECIFIC INSPECTIONS

9.1. (AFISRA) Purpose and Scope. Compliance Inspections provide AFISRA/CC,
MAJCOM/SCC unit, NAF and wing senior leadership an independent evaluation of a unit’s
compliance with public law; Executive Orders; DoD and Air Forces directives and instructions;
USSIDs, NSA Management Directives and instructions defined IAW AFI 90-201. Each CI is
tailored to apply to the specific AFISRA unit(s) or MAJCOM/SCC-subordinate unit(s) being
inspected.
9.2. (AFISRA) Inspection Duration and Frequency.
   9.2.1. (AFISRA) Duration. The AFISRA/IG team requires 3 to 10 duty days to conduct a
   CI. Exact duration will be determined in advance by the Team Chief (TC), approved by the
   AFISRA Commander and published in the inspection schedule. Size of the team conducting
   the inspection and inspection duration will be commensurate with the number and scope of
   programs to be inspected.
   9.2.2. (AFISRA) Frequency. The AFISRA/IG will determine the CI cycle for AFISRA and
   MAJCOM/SCC-subordinate units using a tier system as well as previous inspection results
   and footprint-reduction opportunities (i.e., units located in proximity of other units, even if
   units categorized in other tiers and/or un-like missions and command chain). The maximum
   time between scheduled compliance inspections for AD AFISRA units is 24 months;
   however, units and their chains of command are responsible for reviewing the published
   schedule and preparing to receive the IG on the published dates. Exemptions from or
   requests for an inspection or rescheduling a CI will be adjudicated with the AFISRA/IG
   through a unit’s chain of command no later than 4 months prior to a scheduled or proposed
   inspection. AFISRA Commander approval is required to exceed the 24-month inspection
   cycle. Refer to Attachment 13, for the scheduling processes.
9.3. (AFISRA) Inspection Methodology.
   9.3.1. (AFISRA) IG Team composition. The AFISRA/IG team may consist of: Team
   Chief (TC), Chief of Inspections, Superintendent, Support and Operations Branch Chiefs
   (BC), Subject Matter Expert (SME) inspectors and Augmentation staff (see Attachment 15).
   The number of personnel
required will be determined by the size and scope of the programs being inspected as well as
other logistic and schedule-related considerations.
   9.3.2. (AFISRA) Basic compliance. Unit compliance will be evaluated using Major Graded
   Areas (MGA) and AFISRA (and applicable MAJCOM) inspection guides (see Attachment
   3). In addition, the AFISRA/IG may use any official guidelines (e.g., Air Force Instructions,
   Mission Essential Task List (METL), unit policies, and USSIDs), as appropriate and
   applicable, to evaluate AFISRA units and units subordinate to another MAJCOM
   conducting/supporting an AFISRA mission; and AF-level SIIs and AFISRA-level CIIs, as
   required.
   9.3.3. (AFISRA) Health, Morale, Welfare and Quality of Life (HMWQoL). The IG
   Superintendent will lead a comprehensive HMWQoL evaluation of unit facilities and their
 96                                                AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   members’ work, recreational and private (e.g., dormitories) environments. Where an
   AFISRA unit is a tenant organization, AFISRA/IG will evaluate host-base support and
   provide feedback to host-base and higher headquarters as appropriate. HMWQoL
   evaluations are not included in a CI report.
   9.3.4. (AFISRA) Formal Recognition Program. The Superior Performer (SP) and Team
   Award programs are the IG’s tool to recognize exceptional individuals and teams. See
   Attachment 16 for criteria and unit requirements.
   9.3.5. (AFISRA) Task Evaluations. Task evaluations may be used to evaluate or
   demonstrate a unit’s ability to accomplish a critical task (e.g., Fire Evacuation, Self-Aid and
   Buddy Care Evaluation, Dumpster Dive, etc.). Any task evaluations given can be listed in
   the final report. When feasible, inspectors will coordinate and schedule (i.e., start/stop time)
   task evaluations with the appropriate functional management staff, prior to inspection to de-
   conflict with other inspection requirements on the master itinerary. Inspectors will clearly
   detail task-evaluation expectations in advance of the event and make them available to the
   unit. An inspector may terminate a task evaluation when real-world mission, emergencies, or
   other safety concerns occur. Task evaluations may be used to evaluate certain items not
   possible with a paperwork exercise.
   9.3.6. (AFISRA) Best Practice. The IG will validate Best Practices for AF-wide adoption,
   where applicable, IAW AF Handbook (AFH) 38-210, AF Best Practices Clearinghouse.
   Units should also enter any best practices and observations identified from the inspection into
   the official AF record for lessons learned via the Joint Lessons Learned Information System
   (JLLIS).
9.4. (AFISRA) Inspection Execution. The standard CI timeline is based on a 5-day period,
starting on a Monday or Tuesday and ending on a Friday. Wing/center inspections may require
up to 10 days. See Table 9.2 for a graphical representation of a typical inspection timeline.

Table 9.1. Standard/Sample CI Timeline.

   9.4.1. (AFISRA) Travel Day (inbound and outbound). Travel days are normally the day
   prior to the inspection date (inbound) and the day of or after the outbrief (outbound). A unit
   can expect the entire team to arrive and depart together, unless otherwise specified. For
   OCONUS inspections, inbound travel may accommodate a 24-hour recovery period; the
   team may also send a small advance party to arrive before the rest of the team to coordinate
   communications set-up or special requirements associated with the inspection. When
   possible, the team will depart after the out-brief Friday as timing and airline schedules
   permit. The goal is to have the team on the ground for the minimum time necessary to
   properly execute the inspection.
   9.4.2. (AFISRA) In-brief. The Inspection In-brief is the formal ‘kick-off’ of the inspection,
   after which the inspection is not complete until the Out-brief. The IG team will introduce the
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                           97


   team members and provide an orientation to the unit on IG philosophy and mission; the
   grading and validation procedures; the inspection schedule/itinerary; the IG formal
   recognition program; the Trusted Agent and Observer ROE; and emphasize the role of safety
   for the inspection. Senior and mid-level leadership from the inspected unit should be present.
   By exception, the In-brief may be conducted on the inbound travel day to facilitate
   exceptionally complex or time-constrained inspections.
   9.4.3. (AFISRA) Inspection. This period consists of all items outlined in paragraphs 9.3.2 –
   9.3.6, deficiency validations (see Attachment 10) and Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA)
   personal conferences, if necessary. This period may be shorter or longer, depending on size
   and scope of programs inspected. The period of inspection may only be adjusted by the TC
   upon advice of the BCs and Chief of Inspections, and in coordination with the inspected unit.
   9.4.4. (AFISRA) Write, Sell, and Edit (WSE). This is time dedicated to drafting the
   inspection report, validating deficiencies, if necessary; producing leave-behind memoranda
   (see paragraph 9.5.2) and out-briefing presentations; printing recognition certificates; and
   completing any remaining observation requirements. Length of this period will depend on
   the size and scope of programs inspected and the complexity of the report.
   9.4.5. (AFISRA) Out-brief. The TC will lead a mass out-brief, this de-briefing officially
   “wraps-up” or ends the inspection. Commanders should provide a suitable location to ensure
   maximum attendance within resource capability. This presentation may include, but is not
   limited to, a summary of the ratings and HMWQoL observations. Team, Superior Performer
   and Coin awards will be given at this time if coordinated in advance.
9.5. (AFISRA) Reporting Inspection Results.
   9.5.1. (AFISRA) CI Report. The IG will report compliance to the overall inspection,
   MGAs and sub-areas using the five-tier scale:
      9.5.1.1. (AFISRA) OUTSTANDING—The rating given to indicate performance or
      operation far exceeds mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in a
      far superior manner. Resources and programs are very efficiently managed and are of
      exceptional merit. Minimal deficiencies exist.
      9.5.1.2. (AFISRA) EXCELLENT—The rating given to indicate performance or
      operation exceeds mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in a
      superior manner. Resources and programs are very efficiently managed and relatively
      discrepancy-free.
      9.5.1.3. (AFISRA) SATISFACTORY—The rating given to indicate performance or
      operation meets mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in an
      effective and competent manner. Resources and programs are efficiently managed.
      Minor deficiencies may exist but do not impede or limit mission accomplishment.
      9.5.1.4. (AFISRA) MARGINAL—The rating given to indicate performance or
      operation does not meet some mission requirements. Procedures and activities are not
      carried out in an efficient manner. Resources and programs are not efficiently managed.
      Deficiencies exist that impede or limit mission accomplishment.
      9.5.1.5. (AFISRA) UNSATISFACTORY—The rating given to indicate performance or
      operation does not meet mission requirements. Procedures and activities are not carried
98                                                AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


     out in an adequate manner. Resources and programs are not adequately managed.
     Significant deficiencies exist that preclude or seriously limit mission accomplishment.
  9.5.2. (AFISRA) No-notice inspections. Due to the fact that no-notice inspection criteria
  are narrow in scope/depth, MGA ratings will be limited to SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL,
  and UNSATISFACTORY and the unit will not receive an overall rating.
  9.5.3. (AFISRA) Leave-behind memoranda.           The CI will provide a leave-behind
  memorandum identifying all critical and significant deficiencies identified during the course
  of the inspection. This will allow the inspected unit to start working issues before the final
  report is published.
  9.5.4. (AFISRA) Report Distribution. The CI report will be released per AFI 90-201. All
  CI reports will be security reviewed for release at the UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL
  USE ONLY level unless otherwise determined by the AFISRA/IG. Upon security review,
  the report will be released to the evaluated unit(s) electronically within 30 days after the end
  of the inspection. Inspection results will be briefed to AFISRA/CC and staff at the next
  available staff meeting.

                    JOINT ORGANIZATIONAL INSPECTIONS (JOI)

10.1. (AFISRA) Purpose and Scope. AFISRA/IG participates in JOIs as the Air Force’s SCC
representative for multi-service/-agency units conducting operations directly supporting a site.
National Security Agency IG will function as the lead-SCC IG when applicable. AFISRA CIs of
AFISRA units collocated with the joint site will be scheduled to match the JOI schedule to allow
for concurrent inspection independent of the JOI.
10.2. (AFISRA) Duration and Frequency.
   10.2.1. (AFISRA) Duration. The JOI team may require 2 to 4 days to conduct a pre-
   inspection coordination visit, during which the lead agency IG determines the best
   size/composition of SMEs to conduct the inspection. The primary JOI team typically
   requires 10 duty days to conduct an inspection. Inspection duration will be determined in
   advance by the lead national agency; duration and number of AFISRA inspectors will be
   commensurate with the number and scope of programs to be inspected and the requirements
   for conducting a concurrent CI.
   10.2.2. (AFISRA) Frequency. JOI rotation is typically 36 months or as dictated by the lead
   agency responsible for the overall inspection. These inspections are the least flexible due to
   the multi-service and multi-agency coordination involved in scheduling.
10.3. (AFISRA) Inspection Methodology. Inspection execution, reporting and report
distribution for JOIs will be conducted IAW published guidance by the lead agency.
10.4. (AFISRA) Inspection Execution. Execution of joint inspections will follow the
guidance and regulations of the lead agency IG. Findings levied against AFISRA will be tracked
by the lead agency IG as well as the AFISRA/IG, Plans and Programs (IGP).
10.5. (AFISRA) Reporting Inspection Results. The lead agency IG will generate, maintain
and distribute inspection reports.

lieu of minor deficiencies.
Repeat Deficiency—Any and every recorded discrepancy from previous like-inspections. A
deficiency resulting from failure to comply with the same guidance that has been noted on a
previous inspection (including deficiencies from any limited or no-notice inspections) of the
same installation/unit.
(AFISRA) Repeat Deficiency— A deficiency assessed on a previous inspection but reoccurs
upon subsequent inspection of the same unit or headquarters.
SATISFACTORY—The rating given to indicate performance or operation meets mission
requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in an effective and competent manner.
Resources and programs are efficiently managed. Minor deficiencies may exist but do not
impede or limit mission accomplishment.
Significant Deficiency—A validated deficiency that has or could have negative mission impact.
Regarding nuclear inspections, a significant deficiency will have, or is likely to have a major
negative effect on the nuclear weapons mission of the activity but is not defined as an

knowledge, perseverance, and professionalism contributed greatly to the unit’s compliance
and/or exceeding what is required in accordance with directives and high state of mission
readiness.
Synchronized—Those inspection-type activities that take place alongside (occur
simultaneously) a formal IG inspection; these inspection-type activities must be coordinated with
the MAJCOM Gatekeeper and will not be conducted by IG-assigned personnel (e.g., AF/JA Art
6 Pt I); these inspection-type activities must be listed in Attachment 2 in order to facilitate
installation access without undue hardship on behalf of the inspecting agency.
(Added-AFISRA) Task Evaluation— Used to evaluate or demonstrate a unit’s ability to
accomplish a critical task (i.e., Fire Evacuation, Self-Aid Buddy Care Evaluation, Dumpster
Dive, etc.).

released to assist the IG for the duration of the inspection; they will have no responsibilities
outside their IG function and may act only in an official liaison capacity with unit members
during the course of the inspection.
Unit—For the purposes of this Instruction, a “unit” is defined as a wing or wing-equivalent
organization.
UNSATISFACTORY—The rating given to indicate performance or operation does not meet
mission requirements. Procedures and activities are not carried out in an adequate manner.

legitimate stockpiles and reserves for wartime needs, which may appear redundant and costly,
are not considered waste.
White Space—For the purposes of this Instruction, “white space” is defined as available time on
a unit’s calendar that unit leadership can utilize to best suit their needs without hindrance from
higher headquarters.

           Notes:
           MAJCOM designated Stan/Eval Personnel
           conduct unit JTAC S/E program inspections.
           Inspections consist of two parts, the
           Individual JTAC Evaluation Program and the
           Operational JTAC Evaluation.
           Items are evaluated for compliance and
           inspections conducted through audits and
           interviews with leadership and program
           managers. SEE Objectivity Evaluations are
           conducted through performance evaluations
           and previous evaluations are reviewed. For
           Operational JTAC Evaluations, written
           examinations are administered to 100% of
           available JTACs and 25% of total assigned
           JTACs are administered performance
           evaluations.

                                        Attachment 8
       WOUNDED, ILL, AND INJURED (WII) INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

A8.1. Background. Congress, as part of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), requires Inspectors General to inspect government-provided facilities that house
patients on medical hold. Section 1662, Access of Recovering Service Members to Adequate
Outpatient Residential Facilities, outlines the requirement for inspecting and reporting. In
September 2007, DOD issued standards for inspection of facilities for outpatient service
members. To ensure compliance with DOD standards, inspectors will use the checklist at the
end of this Attachment when performing the WII inspection.
A8.2. Notification of Inspection Requirement: SAF/IGI will receive a monthly listing of
recovering Air Force wounded warriors from AF/A1S; after informing TIG of current Air Force
wounded warrior inspection requirements, SAF/IGI will forward the list to AFIA for formal
inspection coordination. If an installation will be expecting a recovering wounded warrior to
reside in government-owned housing (base housing, on-base dorms, billeting), the MAJCOM/IG
will be personally notified by e-mail and/or phone by AFIA. The notification will include the
wounded warrior’s name, their Recovery Care Coordinator (RCC), the wounded warrior’s
prospective address (government-provided housing facility), and any other pertinent information
deemed necessary to facilitate the inspection coordination process.
A8.3. Frequency. The inspection requirement is to perform an annual inspection on the
government-owned housing facility for as long as the recovering Airman is in wounded warrior
status. The initial inspection should be performed during the next scheduled inspection at that
base where the recovering wounded warrior will reside (if that base is not due an inspection
within a year, then the MAJCOM/IG will perform the inspection as soon as possible).
Subsequent inspections will be accomplished annually thereafter, for as long as the recovering
Airman remains in a wounded warrior status.
A8.4. Pre-Occupancy Inspection. In addition to the scheduled WII inspection, MAJCOM/IGs
will instruct the wounded warrior’s commander to perform a pre-occupancy inspection of the
residence, to take place before the recovering wounded warrior takes occupancy (or as soon as
possible if notification from A1 to SAF/IGI is not timely enough to allow an inspection before
the wounded warrior physically moves into the government-owned housing). Additional
personnel deemed necessary shall accompany the commander on the pre-occupancy inspection
(the individual's commander, first sergeant, CE commander, housing/dorm manager, and local
medical RCC). The goal is to ensure the individual's medical and housing needs are being met—
if not, then the commander is responsible for ensuring appropriate steps are taken to meet them.
Submit a copy of the completed checklist and all documentation addressing deficiencies to the
IG Team Chief upon their arrival for the inspection.
A8.5. Contracted Housing Management. If housing is managed by contracted personnel, the
MAJCOM/IG and the installation leadership will work with the contractor to ensure the
inspection takes place in a timely manner.
A8.6. Personal Interview. As part of the formal WII inspection, the MAJCOM inspection
Team Chief will interview the recovering Airman one-on-one to get a sense of their overall care;
this should be documented in the report.
       232                                             AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   A8.7. Joint Base Housing Facility Inspections. It has been agreed that regardless which
   Service "owns/manages" the government-provided housing, Air Force inspectors will inspect
   housing occupied by Airmen; Army inspectors will inspect housing occupied by Soldiers; Navy
   inspectors will inspect housing occupied by Sailors; and Marine inspectors will inspect housing
   occupied by Marines. There is no requirement to inspect quarters already identified/certified as
   DOD compliant for recovering wounded warriors (e.g., Fisher House, Malone House); however,
   the IG Team Chief will interview the wounded warrior to ensure their needs are being met.
   Although most ADA compliant quarters meet DOD standards for the wounded warrior program,
   the IG Team Chief will interview the wounded warrior to ensure the quarters are sufficient and
   that their needs are being met. This interview need not be conducted in person.
   A8.8. Final Report Disposition. In accordance with House Resolution 4986, Section 1662, the
   MAJCOM/IG will forward copies of the final report to the installation commander, the
   commander of the affiliated Medical Treatment Facility, AF/SG and SECAF. Additionally, a
   copy of the final report will be posted on the MAJCOM/IG public web site.
         A8.8.1. AFIA/SG will build an annual consolidated AF report from all MAJCOM WII
         inspections. NLT 30 days prior to the OSD-established close-out date, AFIA will staff the
         AF WII Housing Facility Inspections report, congressional letters and ASD(HA) letter
         through SAF/IGI, SAF/FMBL, SAF/LL, AF/A4/7 and AF/SG to SAF/IG for signature.
         A8.8.2. The MAJCOM/IG will also forward a copy of the report to AFIA to assimilate data
         for the annual report to Congress. At the end of the calendar year, AFIA will prepare letters
         to select members of Congress for TIG’s signature. Letters to OSD, Senators and
         Congressmen indicate the Air Force's WII inspection requirements for the year and any
         deficiencies noted (TIG will send signed letters to the Chairman and Ranking Members of
         Senate/House Armed Services Committees). After TIG signs the letters, SAF/IGI will route
         them through DOD accordingly.
   A8.9. Inspection Checklist: The inspection checklist (Table A8.1) incorporates requirements
   set forth by DOD and is designed for a combination of interview, physical inspection and
   documentation review. It should be executed at the location to be inspected with the patient,
   case manager, and base housing facility representative present. The primary point of contact for
   scheduling the inspection should be the case manager. When possible, the inspector should
   either review applicable documents prior to the inspection or request the housing facility
   representative to bring such documents with him/her to the inspection. Documentation may
   include (but is not limited to) Pre-Occupancy Inspection checklist with associated documents,
   pending work orders on the housing facility, work orders executed within the past six months,
   asbestos documentation, lead paint documentation, pest control documentation & procedures,
   and mold documentation. Inspected areas will be rated IN COMPLIANCE, NOT IN
   COMPLIANCE, or IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMMENTS.

                              Attachment 10 (Added-AFISRA)
              INSPECTION REPORTING PROCESSING (DEFICIENCIES)

A10.1. General. AFISRA IG will levy deficiencies upon a unit during the course of an
inspection. A deficiency is a core problem within the scope of the unit’s authority requiring
review by higher headquarters staff (Wing/Center/Group). Critical and Significant deficiencies
require immediate, answerable action by the unit or higher headquarters (HHQ). The following
procedures are designed to ensure efficient and timely response to deficiencies and appropriate
follow-up action for all AFISRA and MAJCOM/SCC-subordinate inspection reports.
A10.2. Deficiency Overview.
   A10.2.1. Deficiency generation. A deficiency assessed during an inspection will describe
   the contextual facts as necessary to convey the defect requiring resolution. The written
   description should be adequate to begin corrective action planning. Deficiencies will be
   assigned a deficiency severity of Critical, Significant, or Minor and will receive a unique
   tracking number in IGEMS. Once the report is published, all SIGNIFICANT/CRITICAL
   deficiencies will be tracked by AFISRA/IG Chief of Inspections through IGEMS. Minor
   deficiencies will be tracked at the Wing/Center level, with the exception of minor
   deficiencies that were closed during the course of the inspection. Those deficiencies will be
   considered closed at the organization to which the deficiency was levied.
   A10.2.2. AFISRA/IG will validate all deficiencies with appropriate staff OPRs. Validation
   consists of investigating the issue(s) with the appropriate Functional Area Manager (FAM) or
   Subject Matter Expert and ensuring the facts of the situation are understood and in
   accordance with applicable regulations and guidance. The decision on whether or not a
   validated issue is a deficiency rests solely with AFISRA/IG.
   A10.2.3. Basic responsibility for problem solving and deficiency corrective action process
   resides at the lowest appropriate command level.
   A10.2.4. Deficiencies will continue to apply even if a unit is re-subordinated to another
   command or the unit mission changes significantly. All established timelines for corrective
   actions will remain until a deficiency is closed.
   A10.2.5. Role Assignment. AFISRA/IG will assign an OPR, an OCR (when applicable),
   and a Deficiency Closure OPR (DCO) to all deficiencies in the final inspection report, and
   will assign each a specific role in IGEMS for the IGEMS deficiency closure process.
       A10.2.5.1. OPR. AFISRA/IG will assign the inspected unit as the OPR for all
       deficiencies in the final inspection report. The inspected unit is defined as the unit to
       which the final inspection report is written.
          A10.2.5.1.1. AFISRA/IG will assign the individual(s) identified as the inspected
          unit’s IGEMS POC as the “Organization POC” for the IGEMS deficiency closure
          process.
       A10.2.5.2. OCR. AFISRA/IG will usually not assign an OCR for MINOR deficiencies.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                         257


        A10.2.5.2.1. AFISRA/IG will assign the applicable Wing/Center as the OCR for
        SIGNIFICANT/ CRITICAL deficiencies assessed during inspections on
        Wing/Center’s subordinate units.
        A10.2.5.2.2. AFISRA/IG will assign the individual(s) identified as the
        Wing/Center’s IGEMS POC as the “Corrective Action OPR POC” (CAO) for the
        IGEMS deficiency closure process.
     A10.2.5.3. DCO. For all MINOR deficiencies, AFIRSA/IG will assign the Wing/Center
     as the DCO in the final inspection report.
        A10.2.5.3.1. AFISRA/IG will assign the appropriate HQ AFISRA FAM as the DCO
        for all SIGNIFICANT/CRITICAL deficiencies assessed at the Wing/Center or below.
        A10.2.5.3.2. AFISRA/IG will assign the individual(s) identified as the Wing/Center
        IGEMS POC as the “Corrective Action OPR POC” (CAO) for the IGEMS deficiency
        closure process for all SIGNIFICANT/CRITICAL deficiencies.
        A10.2.5.3.3. AFISRA/IG will assign the appropriate HQ AFISRA FAM as the
        “Functional Area POC” for the IGEMS deficiency closure process.
  A10.2.6. AFISRA/IG Chief of Inspections will:
     A10.2.6.1. Change the deficiency status to “Closed” after reviewing that the deficiency
     closure process has been appropriately managed and after the unit has “Implemented” the
     RCA/CAP after the DCO has “Accepted”. The decision on whether or not a deficiency
     will be closed rests solely with AFISRA/IG.
     A10.2.6.2. Oversee the management of all deficiencies to include: tracking deficiency
     status; monitoring/coordinating corrective actions between the unit and staff OPRs and
     mediate deficiency closure; updating suspenses; preparing and distributing taskings;
     collecting replies; and maintaining file copies of all AFISRA inspection reports and
     deficiencies involving AFISRA or MAJCOM/SCC-subordinate units IAW DoDR
     5400.7/Air Force Supplement, DOD Freedom of Information Act Program. If required
     by another MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force (NAF), or Agency's report instructions,
     AFISRA/IG will forward staff-approved replies to the applicable inspection agency.
     A10.2.6.3. Forward the unit corrective actions to the appropriate inspection branch
     (Operations or Support) for coordination, who will assign the appropriate inspector to
     review and coordinate with the applicable DCO and/or FAM(s). Following the review
     and receipt of recommendations from the inspector and DCO/FAM, AFISRA/IG will
     either close the deficiency or forward comments back to the unit for further action as
     required. Deficiencies not requiring a long term corrective action plan should be closed
     within 6 months. AFISRA/IG may decide to close deficiencies requiring more than 6
     months if the corrective action plan is in place and adequately addresses the root cause of
     the original deficiency. If the deficiency OPR and OCR cannot agree on a corrective
     action plan, AFISRA IG may assist to facilitate closure. Any further required arbitration
     will be addressed at the AFISRA/CV level.
     A10.2.6.4. Ensure all correspondence for other MAJCOMs or inspection Agencies'
     reports are routed through the AFISRA/IG. IG will monitor suspense dates and supply
     external agencies with status updates IAW applicable report reply instructions.

                      COMMAND AND SPECIAL INTEREST ITEM

A12.1. (AFISRA) Command Interest Item (CII). The purpose of a CII is to collect
information or evaluate a program status throughout the AFISRA. CIIs focus command attention
on a particular issue of concern or interest to the commander. Anyone within AFISRA can
nominate a CII through his/her chain-of-command to the appropriate staff agency for
sponsorship.
   A12.1.1. (AFISRA) The AFISRA staff agency sponsoring a CII nomination to AFISRA/CC
   will prepare CIIs in accordance with the format in this attachment, coordinate with other
   directors and agencies as applicable (to include ANG/AFRC), then forward proposed CII to
   AFISRA/IG. All CIIs must be approved by AFISRA/CC.
   A12.1.2. (AFISRA) AFISRA/IG will format any proposed CII for release, assign a number,
   and staff the CII through AFISRA directorates to the AFISRA/CC for approval. Upon
   approval, AFISRA/IG will disseminate the CII to AFISRA units, MAJCOM/SCC-
   subordinate units, ANG and AFRC for further dissemination by the addressees to their
   subordinate units.
   A12.1.3. (AFISRA) FAM will review CIIs prior to expiration. When the staff agency
   determines that the CII is no longer applicable, it will recommend rescission to AFISRA/CC.
   If the staff agency determines that the CII is applicable past the initial period, it will
   coordinate with AFISRA/IG to extend the CII no later than one month prior to the expiration
   date.
A12.2. (AFISRA) Special Interest Item (SII). AFISRA can also author and sponsor an issue
for inclusion in inspections throughout the Air Force. The staffing process for an SII is the same
as for a CII until it is approved by AFISRA/CC. AFISRA/IG will staff proposed SIIs to SAF/IG
in accordance with AFI 90-201.
   A12.2.1. (AFISRA) SII Reports: For Air Force SIIs, AFISRA/IG consolidates inputs on a
   quarterly basis, from the date the SII becomes effective. IG submits these consolidated
   reports to SAF/IGI in an MS Word document with all the required information.
A12.3. (AFISRA) Reporting. AFISRA/IG inspection reports will contain all SII and CII
results as a separate section of the report. Each SII/CII must have a functional representative
identified from the AFISRA staff as the OPR.

                                      SCHEDULING

A13.1. (AFISRA) Scheduling Responsibilities.
   A13.1.1. (AFISRA) AFISRA/IG: AFISRA/IGP has overall responsibility for scheduling
   CIs for all AFISRA units for which AFISRA has inspection responsibility, to include ANG
   units. AFISRA/IGP works within the Inspector General Scheduling Report System (IGSRS)
   with other MAJCOMs and NGB POCs to schedule inspections of other MAJCOM units in
   which there is an SCC mission. In addition, AFISRA/IGP will:
      A13.1.1.1. (AFISRA) Monitor all known unit commitments that could affect inspection
      scheduling.
      A13.1.1.2. (AFISRA) Publish inspection interval guidelines for AFISRA, ACC/SCC
      and AFSPC/SCC-subordinate units. Inspection scheduling of ANG units will be done in
      coordination with the functional manager.
      A13.1.1.3. (AFISRA) Schedule inspections for AFISRA units. Coordinate with ACC
      and AFSPC to schedule inspections for other MAJCOM/SCC units. Where a unit has
      recently received or will receive formal inspections on specific areas, IG may give credit
      in those areas for an upcoming AFISRA/IG inspection. These areas may include, but are
      not limited to: Logistics Compliance Assessment Program; Standardization/Evaluation
      Visits. Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment and
      Management Program (ESOHCAMP) MAJCOM/IG inspections of the Environmental,
      Safety, and Occupational Health functional areas will not duplicate NGB ESOHCAMP
      inspection elements IAW AFI 90-201, 3.3.5.
      A13.1.1.4. (AFISRA) Build an AFISRA/IG annual inspection schedule and obtain
      AFISRA Commander approval for inspections scheduled at all assigned and gained units.
      A13.1.1.5. (AFISRA) Brief Commander, AFISRA annually on upcoming CIs and
      obtain approval for the block of inspections. The block of inspections should be briefed
      and approved no later than 12 months prior to the scheduled inspections.
      A13.1.1.6. (AFISRA) Publish a consolidated 12-month inspection schedule for all
      AFISRA, MAJCOM/SCC-subordinates, and NGB units under AFISRA oversight.
      Collaborate inspections dates with AFSPC inspection POC to meet inspections
      requirement for AFSPC-SCC units.
      A13.1.1.7. (AFISRA) Prepare and transmit a notification message/letter to inspected
      unit for all upcoming AFISRA/IG inspections NLT 120 days before the scheduled
      inspection. Coordinate with appropriate MAJCOMs or agency on SCC inspection
      notification messages. When the inspected unit is a tenant of another organization, the
      notification will also be addressed to the host unit.
      A13.1.1.8. (AFISRA) Verify if any contracted activities that fall within the scope of the
      inspection exist.
      A13.1.1.9. (AFISRA) NLT 30 days prior to the inspection date, will work with unit to
      identify two unit-level Corrective Action Plan (CAP) POCs and inform AFISRA/IGP via
 268                                             AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


       e-mail afisraigp@lackland.af.mil. Unit level CAP POCs will require access to the
       Inspector      General       Evaluation     Management       Systems     (IGEMS)       at
       https://opoc4j.hill.af.mil/igems/home.do. CAP POCs are responsible for documenting
       corrective plans/actions in IGEMS after the inspection is complete and will monitor all
       unit deficiencies untill closed. Parent unit IGs will help CAP POCs attain proper system
       access.
A13.2. (AFISRA) Inspection Rescheduling, Exemptions, and Cancellations. Units desiring
to reschedule an inspection on the AFISRA-approved schedule must submit a formal request
through their appropriate headquarters to AFISRA/A2/3. AFISRA/A2/3 will coordinate the
request with AFISRA/IGP and forward a decision package to AFISRA/CC for approval.
AFRC/NGB units will send these requests to HQ AFRC/IG or NGB/IGD and info copy
AFISRA/IGP. HQ AFRC/IG or NGB/IGD will review the request and forward their
recommendation to the AFISRA/IG. Requests will be validated by the AFISRA functional staff
and coordinated with AFISRA/IG. AFISRA/CC is the final approval authority for inspection
rescheduling, exemptions, and cancellations. Although not all-inclusive, the following gives
examples of circumstances that may be cause for inspection reschedule, exemption, or
cancellation: undergoing a substantial HHQ-directed reorganization; major unit mission change;
large-scale real-world contingency deployments/commitments; modification/conversion
requiring extensive training of personnel and/or modifying maintenance procedures.
A13.3. (AFISRA) Re-inspection. Re-inspection of units is at the discretion of AFISRA/CC
upon advice of AFISRA/IG.
AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013                                                         269


                             Attachment 14 (Added-AFISRA)
                 INSPECTION PREPARATION AND REQUIREMENTS

A14.1. General. A successful inspection is grounded in proactive inspection preparation.
Robust self-assessment programs and cross-tell between fellow units (particularly those with
similar weapons systems/missions) are essential for units preparing for inspection. Prompt,
accurate responses to AFISRA/IG requests for information and efforts to coordinate support
requirements for the visit are also essential components for an overall successful inspection.
A14.2. Unit Self-Assessment Programs.
   A14.2.1. Wings and Centers. Commanders at every level will comply with AFISRA Self-
   Assessment Program as outlined in a future instruction. The AFISRA encourages Wings and
   Centers to champion inspection issues on behalf of their subordinate units. This includes
   acting as liaison to resolve questions/issues with the HQ FAMs for upcoming inspections and
   encouraging robust unit self-assessment programs. The AFISRA Self-Assessment Program
   applies to AFISRA active duty and Classic Associate ANG units. AFRC units will follow
   guidance prescribed by the AFRC Inspector General.
   A14.2.2. Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT). All units will utilize MICT to
   complete applicable SA checklists. MICT will be used to track, validate and trend
   discrepancy items and corrective actions. It is also highly recommended units upload to
   MICT, documents supporting compliance of checklist items.
   A14.2.3. All open deficiencies will be reviewed on a regular basis as determined by the
   Wing/Center or equivalent Commander. Deficiencies will be closed when the corrective
   action plan has been completed.
   A14.2.4. Units will accomplish all applicable Self-Assessment (SA) checklists IAW this
   Supplement and future AFISRA guidance/instructions.
A14.3. AFISRA Pre-Inspection Methodology & Actions.
   A14.3.1. AFISRA functional staff will be granted access to MICT.
   A14.3.2. AFISRA/IG will utilize MICT to conduct virtual compliance inspections (to be
   determined at a future date) which will become part of the unit’s overall inspection grade.
   Virtual inspections will entail such things as reviewing appointment letters and the like,
   which can be uploaded into MICT’s database (at a future date).
   A14.3.3. The AFISRA/IG Team may review deficiency histories recorded in MICT to note
   any open discrepancies or recently closed ones. The unit’s corrective actions already taken
   may receive consideration as outlined in paragraph 6.3.1.3.
   A14.3.4. The AFISRA/IG Team will review any open deficiencies, as well as, any past
   deficiencies recorded in IGEMS for the unit. Deficiencies will be closed via IGEMS when
   the corrective action plan has been completed.
A14.4. Pre-Inspection Actions.
   A14.4.1. Inspection Planning Message. The IG will initiate contact with the unit via an
   Inspection Planning Message to establish a structured collaboration process with the unit. It
270                                              AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


  will confirm the dates of the inspection, establish initial communication between Inspection-
  Planning POC and IG, and provide additional instructions.
      A14.4.1.1. Inspection-Planning POC. The Inspection-Planning POC is a unit member
      designated by the unit as the focal point for all collaboration and exchange of information
      between the inspected unit (or multiple units at same geographic location) and the IG
      team (IGP) leading up to the inspection. Further instructions on Inspection-Planning
      POC duties will be included in the notification message. Unit members are encouraged
      to communicate with the AFISRA/IG through the Inspection-Planning POC unless the
      issue is more appropriately raised through the chain of command or other formal
      processes (e.g., rescheduling an inspection).
      A14.4.1.2. Trusted Agent. Appointed by the unit commander, the Trusted Agent is a
      unit member released to assist the IG for the duration of the inspection. Commanders
      will ensure Trusted Agents are released from all unit responsibilities for the duration of
      the inspection. Commanders will also ensure unit members understand the Trusted
      Agent’s role during the inspection.
         A14.4.1.2.1. Trusted Agent Requirements. The Trusted Agent may be any Air Force
         Specialty Code (AFSC), a rank between A1C to SSgt (or for Readiness Inspections,
         the rank commensurate with Subject Matter Expert knowledge to assist with
         intelligence scenario integration and task evaluation development), and have excellent
         military bearing and professional appearance. To assist the IG team in getting around
         the base and into all necessary facilities, he/she must possess a Top Secret Special
         Compartmented Information clearance, be thoroughly knowledgeable of the
         base/facilities, and, if overseas, possess a current military driver's license. Trusted
         Agents will not be Program Managers (neither the primary nor alternate) of any
         program area to be inspected.
         A14.4.1.2.2. Trusted Agent Duties. The Trusted Agent will work directly for the
         Work Center Manager (WCM) to ensure the IG has the equipment, communications
         and supplies it needs to conduct the inspection. Duties may include, but are not
         limited to: opening/closing the work center each day and coordinating meetings and
         requests for information between the unit and IG members. Trusted Agents will sign
         a non-disclosure statement prior to assuming duties regarding instructions on what
         information cannot be divulged to unauthorized personnel (e.g., unit members,
         observers, others).
         A14.4.1.2.3. Observer. Members from other units present during a compliance
         inspection at the request of the inspected unit. Their presence will not interfere with
         the inspection process, nor will they be afforded additional access to the IG Team. If
         observers will be present during a compliance inspection, the inspected unit’s
         Inspection-Planning POC must coordinate their presence with AFISRA/IG/IGP 30
         days prior to the beginning of the inspection, so that appropriate rules of engagement
         may be defined for their integration into the inspection process.
      A14.4.1.3. Unit Deliverables. The Inspection Notification Message will direct certain
      deliverables be sent to AFISRA/IGP both before and during the inspection. In addition to
      administrative requirements listed in Table A14.1, the IG may request automated
      background data be provided before the team’s arrival. Units will ensure classification

                               AUGMENTATION PROGRAM

A15.1. (AFISRA) General. The augmentation program is designed to ensure the IG team’s
composition for each inspection contains the subject matter expertise and experience needed to
conduct the inspection. The program allows the AFISRA/IG to bring additional staff to enhance
inspection capability for less frequently inspected functions. The goal is to maximize the IG’s
ability to execute tailored, thorough inspections on a robust inspection schedule, while ensuring
all programs are inspected by appropriate SMEs and enhancing cross-flow among headquarters
elements and field units.
A15.2. (AFISRA) Defining Augmentation Requirements. In advance of an inspection start
date, the CI will formally request support for potential augmenters through the requested
augmenters’ command chain. There is no requirement for a commander to support an
augmentation request – only that they provide a prompt reply approving or disapproving the
request. Approval means that the unit agrees to release the augmenter for the duration of the
inspection period; all TDY expenses will be paid by the AFISRA/IG. DoD augmenters will
follow civilian personnel guidelines pertaining to over-time/comp-time issues.
   A15.2.1. (AFISRA) HQ AFISRA directorates will support the IG augmentation Request for
   Forces (RFF) by identifying and providing the appropriate subject matter experts (SME) for
   inspections identified on the annual IG schedule. AFISRA directorates, wings and centers
   review the IG RFF requirements and nomination criteria then consider long-term personnel
   planning implications necessary to support the IG RFF and mandatory training requirements.
   In advance of an inspection start date, the Chief of Inspections will formally request support
   for potential augmenters through the requested augmenters’ chain of command. Approval
   means that the unit agrees to release the augmenter for the duration of the inspection period;
   all TDY expenses will be paid by the AFISRA/IG. Civilian augmenters will follow civilian
   personnel guidelines pertaining to over-time/comp-time issues.
   A15.2.2. (AFISRA) Each directorate will submit the IG RFF Worksheet with a breakout of
   FY external manpower support required. The first worksheet tab contains the RFF Summary
   and each tab thereafter contains specific requirements from each directorate, wing, and
   center. Please reference the IG Augmentation Criteria & ROE (paragraph A15.4) to guide
   your selection of appropriate SME augmenters.
A15.3. (AFISRA) Augmentation Nomination Criteria.
   A15.3.1. (AFISRA) Augmentation nominees must be experts in their career field and will
   be expected to embody Air Force core values. They must have thorough knowledge of
   current policies, procedures, and practices applicable to the position they will fill or programs
   they will inspect.
   A15.3.2. (AFISRA) Nominees must meet or exceed USAF standards for conduct and
   appearance; they must have passed their most recent Physical Fitness Test.
   A15.3.3. (AFISRA) Nominees must have a security clearance required to gain access to
   facilities and programs they will inspect.
 274                                             AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


   A15.3.4. (AFISRA) Nominees must not have participated in a SAV of the inspected unit
   within 180 days of the inspection or any Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA) inspection
   activity with the inspected unit within the last year.
A15.4. (AFISRA) Augmenter Rules of Engagement.
   A15.4.1. (AFISRA) Augmenters are considered a member of the AFISRA/IG for the
   duration of the inspection.
   A15.4.2. (AFISRA) Augmenters must follow IG writing and reporting standards.
   A15.4.3. (AFISRA) Augmenters will be sponsored by a core inspector from nomination
   through inspection conclusion. The core-team sponsor and augmenter must cooperatively
   ensure the following requirements:
       A15.4.3.1. (AFISRA) Submit administrative data, upon request, needed for logistical
       planning to include, but not limited to: Government Travel Card information; card
       number on reverse of AF Form 1199; Air Force Entry Control Card, when needed;
       contact numbers (for member and family) in case of after-hour changes or en route travel
       coordination.
       A15.4.3.2. (AFISRA) Complete AFISRA Augmentation training and any other required
       training (e.g., Phase I/II contract oversight training IAW AFISRAI 63-1201, Multi-
       Functional Team for Performance-Based Services Acquisition, 29 November 2007) prior
       to the inspection.
       A15.4.3.3. (AFISRA) Ensure travel orders and tickets are accomplished.
       A15.4.3.4. (AFISRA) Attend the Pre-Inspection Meeting (PIM), normally held the
       Wednesday prior to team travel. Augmenters not stationed locally will not be funded to
       attend; however, sponsor will forward all critical information to the augmenter.
       A15.4.3.5. (AFISRA) Wear an inspector badge during the inspection.
       A15.4.3.6. (AFISRA) Attend all team meetings and appointments.
   A15.4.3. (AFISRA) 7 Ensure sponsor has 100 percent accountability of the augmenter, to
   include transportation to and from the inspection location and during the inspection (e.g.,
   carpooling arrangements and off-duty time).
A15.5. (AFISRA) Request for Forces (RFF).
   A15.5.1. (AFISRA) Due to the limited number of core members, the IG requires additional
   military and civilian augmenters annually to conduct AF Compliance Inspection (CI),
   Readiness Inspections (RI) and Joint Operational Inspections (JOI). These CIs, RIs, and JOIs
   would not be possible without the assistance of AFISRA staff two-letter directorates, wings,
   and centers. The IG Augmentation Criteria and ROE (see paragraphs A15.3 and A15.4) will
   guide your selection of appropriate SME augmenters.
   A15.5.2. (AFISRA) AFISRA directorates, wings and centers review the IG RFF
   requirements and nomination criteria, consider long-term personnel planning implications,
   and be prepared to support the IG RFF and mandatory training requirements.

                                RECOGNITION PROGRAM

A16.1. (AFISRA) General. The IG Recognition Program is designed to formally recognize
individuals and organized teams from the inspected unit who have demonstrated Air Force Core
Values on the job. The IG recognition program will showcase members who demonstrate
exceptional solution-based initiative, work ethic, and achievement of purpose-driven goals. The
IG will validate unit nominations for Superior Performers and Team Awards, as well as generate
their own nominations during the inspection that will be validated with unit leadership.
Nomination procedures, validation and form of recognition are outlined below.
A16.2. (AFISRA) Types of Awards.
   A16.2.1. (AFISRA) Superior Performer (SP). Superior Performers are Program Managers
   singled out through individual performance and achievement by the unit and/or the IG
   inspectors. SPs will be listed by name, rank and duty section in the final report and will
   receive a certificate (AFISRA Form 42, Superior Performer) signed by the AFISRA/IG.
   A16.2.2. (AFISRA) Team Award. Team Awards are used to recognize organized groups of
   unit members brought together for a specific purpose. Nominations must illustrate how the
   team achieved a high-level of success toward their intended goal above and beyond what
   would be expected, or required, as part of mission operations. Team Award members will be
   listed in the final report and will receive a certificate (AFISRA Form 41, Team Award)
   signed by the AFISRA/IG. IG Inspection preparation teams will not be considered for Team
   Awards.
   A16.2.3. (AFISRA) Coin Award. IG Coins are used to selectively recognize an individual
   based on observations made by the IG team during the inspection. Coin Award nominations
   are submitted to the IG Superintendent by IG inspectors for individuals they observe who
   exemplify the highest standards of dress and appearance, customs, courtesies, and duty
   performance, and whose contribution to the mission is above that of his/her peers. There are
   no grade restrictions for coin recipients, however all members must have no quality force
   issues. Coin recipients will be presented the IG coin at/near the end of the inspection at a
   time/location arranged with the unit, TC and IG team Superintendent.
A16.3. (AFISRA) Unit Award Nomination Responsibilities. Unit commanders nominate SP
and Team Awards prior to the inspection, no later than 30 days prior to the start date, to
AFISRA/IGP Inspection Planner identified in the Notification Message. SP nominees must be
grades of E1 through E8, O1 through O4, or a maximum civilian pay grade of WG-12. The
number of SPs may not exceed 4 percent of the unit population within those grades (i.e., a unit of
100 people with 80 personnel E1-E8, O1-O4, WG-12 and under would be eligible for 3.2 SPs.
This may be rounded up to the next whole number by the IG at their discretion). There are no
grade restrictions for Team Award recipients. Commanders must ensure members nominated for
SP Recognition Program have no quality force issues. If IG inspectors nominate a unit member
for SP, unit commander will be consulted to ensure the nominee has no quality force issues.

              AFISRA FUNCTIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

A17.1. (AFISRA) AFISRA Functional Area Managers (FAM) are required to develop
checklists from any/all AFISRA created Supplements for use in MICT. AFISRA FAMs will
categorize their checklist items into three tiers as defined:
   A17.1.1. (AFISRA) Tier 1: Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders, or the USAF at
   high risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or waste.
   A17.1.2. (AFISRA) Tier 2: Non-compliance limits mission or program effectiveness or
   efficiency and adds significant risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or
   waste.
   A17.1.3. (AFISRA) Tier 3: Non-compliance limits mission or program effectiveness or
   efficiency but does not create significant risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal
   jeopardy or waste.
A17.2. (AFISRA) AFISRA FAMs will ensure the following criteria is met when developing
checklist for their functional areas:
   A17.2.1. (AFISRA) AFISRA supplemental Self-Assessment Checklist (SAC) file names
   are consistent with published HAF Core-inspection checklists. For example, if a HAF Core-
   inspection checklist name is “Force Support Trafficking in Person (TIP) Self-Assessment
   Checklist”, then the AFISRA Supplement name will be “Force Support Trafficking in Person
   (TIP) Self-Assessment Checklist.” In those instances when there is no associated HAF
   checklist, then the AFISRA checklist name will be “Trafficking in Person (AFISRA Self-
   Assessment Checklist).”
   A17.2.2. (AFISRA) There are no checklist items from the HAF checklist included in the
   associated AFISRA supplemental SAC, in other words, eliminate any redundant items.
   AFISRA supplemental SAC items may enhance or add to a HAF checklist item, just not
   repeat them verbatim. The purpose of an AFISRA supplemental SAC is to supplement or
   enhance the HAF checklist, not make a “carbon copy.”
   A17.2.3. (AFISRA) AFISRA supplemental SAC items have current AFI references or other
   applicable guidance.
   A17.2.4. (AFISRA) AFISRA SAC item numbering convention is consistent with the HAF
   Core checklist item numbering convention. If a HAF checklist uses the numbering format
   (i.e., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.), the AFISRA supplemental SAC must follow the same numbering
   convention. If the last HAF checklist item is #50, then the first AFISRA supplemental SAC
   item will be #51. Likewise, if there is no associated HAF Core checklist, then the AFISRA
   checklist will start with item #1. If you wish to expand on a HAF Core checklist item, then
   use expanded numerals (e.g., HAF Core checklist item #35 can be expanded in the AFISRA
   supplemental SAC as #35.1, 35.2, etc. Since there are no redundant checklist items, there
   should be no duplicate checklist item numbers when comparing the HAF and the associated
   AFISRA supplemental SAC.
   A17.2.5. (AFISRA) Determine/identify SAC degree of criticality using the above tier
   definitions (i.e., Tier 1, 2 or 3). Note: When determining degree of criticality, it’s highly
278                                            AFI90-201_AFISRASUP_I 25 APRIL 2013


  recommended that the AFISRA FAM coordinate with their HAF and AFISRA/IG functional
  counterpart to derive a shared understanding of criticality.
  A17.2.6. (AFISRA) Once the AFISRA FAM has completed the AFISRA SAC, the
  AFISRA FAM will upload the checklist as “Pending” in MICT. IAW AFI 90-201, The
  AFISRA/IG must verify checklist standardization, therefore the functional counterpart will
  review and “Publish” the updated AFISRA supplemental SAC. If the SAC is a supplement
  to a HAF SAC or based on HAF guidance, the HAF level FAM must approve it prior to it
  being published in MICT.
  A17.2.7. (AFISRA) For those AFISRA FAMs that have not completed MICT training or do
  not have MICT FAM permissions, contact the AFISRA Functional manager for a training
  source.
