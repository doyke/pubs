SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include:
Cordless phones are not authorized; explanation of who can appoint TCOs; timelines for work orders;
updated procedures for PINs; updated sample priority letter; and updated sample appointment letter. A
margin bar indicates newly revised material.


1. General.
   1.1. Telecommunications Service. The 375th Communications Squadron (375 CS) provides commu-
   nications connectivity for official government use on Scott AFB. Features provided by the central
   telephone switch and ancillary equipment drive services available to individual customers. Telephone
   options such as “call transfer” and “call forwarding” are software-driven and are limited by system
   capacity, telephone instrument design, and equipment capability. Unfortunately, not all features are
   available at all locations. Funding for all peripheral equipment (to include telephones, wire, jacks,
2                                                               SCOTTAFBI33-104 17 MARCH 2008


    etc.) will be the responsibility of the requesting unit. Cordless phones are not authorized in command
    and control (C2) areas. Cordless phones are authorized in non-C2 areas.
    1.2. Communications Line Connectivity. Communications line connectivity comprises analog/digital
    voice and data connections for all originating and terminating base circuits. Communications line con-
    nectivity also includes digital/data connections for inter-base/intra-base service. Connectivity can
    range from a simple single wire-pair circuit to a high speed fiber-optic link.
    1.3. Base Telephone System Protection. Installation, removal, relocation, or modification of any base
    telephone, telephone equipment, and/or associated wiring without the authorization from 375 CS is
    prohibited.
    1.4. Telephone Control Officers (TCO).
       1.4.1. It is the unit commander’s responsibility to appoint TCOs as the POC for their unit’s com-
       munication needs. TCOs will handle unit communication needs at the squadron level and above.
       Multiple unit TCO responsibilities may be combined higher in the chain, (e.g., a group or major
       command TCO may be appointed to represent the needs of subordinate squadrons) but TCOs will
       not be appointed to serve areas of responsibility smaller than squadron level.
       1.4.2. One primary and no more than two alternate TCOs will be appointed by letter to the 375
       CS/SCMPS signed by the proper appointment authority. The appointment letter must include
       e-mail addresses and duty telephone numbers of the individuals assigned. (Ref: Attachment 2 of
       this instruction.)
       1.4.3. Proper Appointment Authority.
           1.4.3.1. Host organizations/units (squadron level or higher): The commander or appointed (by
           order) representative only.
           1.4.3.2. Associate organizations/agencies: Associate organization commanders, directorates,
           or appointed (by order) representatives only.
       1.4.4. The TCOs will not be permitted to submit any work requests until they have been appointed
       by the proper authority and formally trained by the Scott AFB Telephone Service Center (TSC).
       TCO training will be accomplished annually on the anniversary of the TCO appointment. If TCOs
       are not appointed, the responsibility will default to the responsible unit commander to perform
       TCO duties, however, the training stipulation still applies.

2. Procedures.
    2.1. Only properly trained and appointed TCOs are allowed to submit a Telecommunications Service
    Request (TSR) for new/modified government telephone service and/or communications line connec-
    tivity. TCOs will submit TSRs via the base intranet at https://scottnp.amc.ds.af.mil. (Ref: Attach-
    ment 3 of this instruction.)
    2.2. TSRs must be submitted a minimum of 60 days prior to the customer’s required or anticipated
    service date. Once all necessary parts are received and the TSR is submitted, 375 CS will have 60 days
    to complete the requested work. However, completion dates may be extended during periods of man-
    ning shortages due to deployments and manpower reductions. Requirements needed sooner than the
    60-day window will require a priority justification letter (Ref: Attachment 4 of this instruction) from
    the group commander, equivalent, or higher level explaining the need for urgent/emergency service
SCOTTAFBI33-104 17 MARCH 2008                                                                           3


   and stating the mission impact if denied. The priority justification letter will be forwarded to 375 CS
   Commander (CC) for approval. Once the TSC receives the approved letter, the 375 CS will complete
   the work requested within 15 duty days.
   2.3. When submitting TSRs, state in simple terms what requirements/capabilities are needed. A floor
   plan should be submitted with all requests for service/equipment installations, removals, and reloca-
   tions. Other useful information includes: applicable terminal number/line equipment numbers, direc-
   tory number, and old/new locations for equipment or circuits, to include room numbers.
   2.4. In the event the base intranet is down for an extended period of time or for those organizations
   that do not have web/LAN access, TCOs may submit requests by e-mail to the TSC via tele-
   phone.service.center@scott.af.mil. Urgent requests may be faxed to the TSC at commercial (618)
   256-5999 or DSN 576-5999.
   2.5. All communication requirements for general officer quarters and senior officer quarters must be
   coordinated through 375 CG/Plans and Resources (SCX) who will in-turn coordinate with the base
   housing management office.

3. Special Communications Requests.
   3.1. Primary/Secondary Crash: The 375th Operations Support Squadron (OSS) Commander is the
   OPR for all service additions or deletions to the primary/secondary crash nets. The TSR requests for
   additions, deletions, and/or changes to either net must be approved by the 375 OSS/CC before submis-
   sion to the TSC.
   3.2. FAX, Modem, and Secure Telephone Equipment (STE): The 375 CS/ Wing Information Assur-
   ance (SCBS) is the OPR for approval of all analog fax, modem, and STE line requests. Scott AFB cus-
   tomers will use a separate modem line identification form (Ref: Attachment 8 of this instruction) for
   each fax, modem, or STE line requested and coordinate their requests through the 375 CS/SCBS
   office (commercial (618) 256-9142 or DSN: 576-9142) for approval.
       3.2.1. If the request is approved, the 375 CS/SCBS will initiate a TSR with the TSC for process-
       ing.
       3.2.2. If the request is disapproved, the 375 CS/SCBS will notify the requester.
   3.3. NIPRNET/ SIPRNET: The OPR for NIPRNET and SIPRNET services is 375 CG/SCX. All
   requests must be submitted using the Project, Workflow, Requirements, and Resource (PWRR) via the
   base intranet at https://pwrr.amc.af.mil.

4. Special Services.
   4.1. Telephone Control Number (TCN) Program.
       4.1.1. A TCN allows authorized military/civilian personnel to make DSN calls from an off-base
       residence in the performance of their official duties on a temporary basis. This includes personnel
       who are permanent party or on temporary duty at Scott AFB.
       4.1.2. Upon validation of a person’s official need by the TSC, the TSC will notify the base opera-
       tors of the TCN and the approved time period. The TCN user will need to provide the following
       information to the base operator when making a call: their TCN number, their unit TCO’s name,
       and the telephone number they are calling.
4                                                               SCOTTAFBI33-104 17 MARCH 2008


    4.2. Personal Identification Number (PIN).
       4.2.1. PINs are only issued to individuals whose duties require them to use federally funded com-
       mercial long distance services for conducting official business.
       4.2.2. The PIN allows the base telephone billing system to identify long distance calls made using
       the PIN. Itemized call lists are reviewed regularly by the unit TCO. Users found using their PIN
       for other than official purposes may be held financially and/or administratively accountable under
       articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or other applicable federal laws.
       4.2.3. PIN Record Identification Number (PINRIN).
           4.2.3.1. It is vitally important individual PIN users safeguard their PIN from compromise. The
           PINRIN is a unique number associated with the actual PIN number in the billing system. The
           PINRIN may be used to securely correspond with the unit TCO and the TSC regarding the PIN
           without compromising the actual PIN number.
           4.2.3.2. Unit TCOs should only record the PINRIN and e-mail addresses of personnel who
           hold PINs and should not know individual PIN numbers in their account. Knowledge of the
           actual PIN number is restricted to the PIN user and those few trusted personnel who have
           access to the systems used to manage and maintain the PIN.
    4.3. PIN Exemption. To obtain a PIN-exempt waiver, in addition to a TSR, a justification letter must
    be submitted to the 375 CS/CC stating the reason for PIN exemption. (Ref: Attachment 6 and
    Attachment 7 of this instruction.) Upon approval, the request will be forwarded to TSC for imple-
    mentation and filing. The TSC will notify the TCO/unit when the letter needs to be revalidated. If the
    TCO/unit does not respond within 30 days, all PIN exempt numbers for the account will be deacti-
    vated.
    4.4. Adopted and Prescribed Forms/IMT’s: No Adopted or Prescribed Forms/IMT’s contained in this
    publication.

          PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER MANAGMENT PROCEDURES

A5.1. Requesting a new PIN.
   A5.1.1. The TCO will submit a Telephone Service Request (TSR) for a PIN with the e-mail address
   display name (e.g. Doe, John D., MSgt, AMC/A3) of the person requesting the PIN. Multiple PIN
   requests may be combined into a single TSR. If the person requiring a PIN does not have an e-mail
   address, the TCO will provide the information normally provided by the e-mail display name and
   properties: last name, first name, middle initial, rank (military) or grade (civilian), or contractor, unit,
   office symbol, and contact number.
   A5.1.2. The TSC will establish the PIN and send a letter containing the PIN Holder Responsibilities
   sheet to the future PIN user via his or her e-mail address and close the TSR.
   A5.1.3. The user will read the letter, and reply (as instructed in the letter) to the sender at the TSC
   with a digitally signed e-mail acknowledging receipt and understanding of the PIN Holder Responsi-
   bilities sheet.
   A5.1.4. The TSC will then forward the PIN to the user via e-mail with read receipt and forward a
   completion receipt to the requesting TCO.
   A5.1.5. The TSC will keep replies and read receipts for active accounts on file should this informa-
   tion be needed as evidence of PIN receipt by the user.

A5.2. Restoring a forgotten PIN.
   A5.2.1. A TSR is not required to restore a PIN for existing PIN users. If a PIN user forgets their PIN,
   the PIN user should contact their TCO rather than calling the TSC directly.
   A5.2.2. The TCO will confirm the user's identity as an authorized PIN holder in his or her account
   and records.
   A5.2.3. The TCO will contact the TSC, provide the user's PINRIN, and ask that the user's PIN be
   restored.
   A5.2.4. The TSC will ensure the e-mail is from a valid TCO, retrieve the PIN from the records,
   restore the PIN to the user via e-mail, and forward a completion receipt to the TCO.

A5.3. Modifying PIN account information.
   A5.3.1. A TSR is not required to modify information for existing PIN users. For example, if the TCO
   becomes aware that a user has moved to another location within the unit, and their contact number or
   e-mail address changes, they can notify the TSC of the change via phone or e-mail.
   A5.3.2. If the contact number has changed, it is a simple matter for the TSC to change the number
   associated with the PIN in TMS.
   A5.3.3. If the e-mail address for the user has changed, the user's PINRIN may change also. If so, the
   TSC will send the new PINRIN to the user and the TCO.
10                                                                SCOTTAFBI33-104 17 MARCH 2008


     A5.3.4. Additionally, the TSC will periodically require an audit of PINs. This will also be done by the
     TCO during their annual equipment and service inventory. As part of this audit, the registered PIN
     user's e-mail addresses will be checked against the Global Address List (GAL) to ensure they are
     valid. Upon checking the properties of each one, if it is found the information listed in the GAL is dif-
     ferent than that associated with the PIN, the information will be changed in TSC records.

A5.4. Deleting a PIN.
     A5.4.1. The PIN user should contact their TCO to have their PIN deactivated if they suspect their PIN
     has been compromised or upon receipt of PCS orders, separation from the military, termination of
     civilian employment, or if they relocate to another organization on base.
     A5.4.2. If the TCO wishes to deactivate the user's PIN for any reason, the TCO should provide the
     user's PINRIN (or e-mail address display name) and request PIN deletion via a TSR to the TSC. Mul-
     tiple PIN requests may be combined into a single TSR.
     A5.4.3. The TSC will delete the PIN number in the switch and send a completion notice to the TCO.
     After the monthly, itemized call report has been processed, the TSC will delete the PIN from the bill-
     ing system records. The data removed will be archived in the TSC PIN order database for a period of
     1 year.
     A5.4.4. An alternate method for deletion is via the automated vMPF out-processing system. In this
     case, the TSC will schedule the member's PIN for deletion, send a notification message to the affected
     TCO account, and mark the member's out-processing checklist item complete. After the member's
     scheduled departure date, the order will be flagged for deletion and deleted as outlined in paragraph
     A5.4.3.

 PROCEDURES FOR PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (PIN) WAIVER ISSUANCE

A6.1. Requester Responsibilities.
   A6.1.1. Prepare and submit a justification letter for PIN waiver to the unit TCO and commander for
   approval. Refer to sample request letter in this instruction. (Ref: Attachment 7 of this instruction.)
       A6.1.1.1. Requests will list telephone numbers for exemption.
       A6.1.1.2. Justification will include frequency of use, emergency or time critical needs, mainte-
       nance costs, and mission impact if request is disapproved.

A6.2. Approval of Pin Waiver Upon approval by the base Communication and Information Systems
Officer (CSO), the requester accepts responsibility for maintaining a log of all calls made for accountabil-
ity to his/her TCO. Call logs should include, as a minimum, date, time, and reason for call. (Note: Call
logs must be maintained IAW the Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) Table33-09, Rule 09 unless the
TCO waives this requirement by having the requester sign next to the calls made as detailed on the
monthly call report TCOs receive from the base TSC).

A6.3. Recertify PIN waiver status annually. The unit TCO will receive notification for annual recerti-
fication from the TSC. If recertification is not received by the suspense date, the telephone numbers will
have their PIN exemption revoked, and the number will revert back to PIN required until recertification is
received.

A6.4. TCO Responsibilities.
   A6.4.1. Review and sign justification letter from requester for PIN waiver and forward to the unit
   commander for approval.
   A6.4.2. Upon approval by the CSO, the TCO accepts responsibility for the following:
       A6.4.2.1. Review, sign, and date monthly call report received from the base TSC verifying all
       calls made were for official business. Return the original document to the TSC and maintain a
       copy of these records IAW with the RDS Table 33-09, Rule 09.
       A6.4.2.2. Review user call log of calls made for completeness. (Note: The TCO may waive this
       requirement by having the requester sign next to the calls made as detailed on the monthly call
       report TCOs receive from the TSC.)

A6.5. Recertify PIN Waiver Status Annually. The unit TCO will receive notification for annual recer-
tification from the TSC. If recertification is not received by the suspense date, the telephone numbers will
have their PIN exemption revoked, and the number will revert back to PIN required until recertification is
received.

A6.6. Unit or Equivalent Commander Responsibilities.
   A6.6.1. Review and sign justification letter received from the TCO for PIN exemption and forward to
   the base CSO for approval.
   A6.6.2. Recertify PIN-waiver statuses annually.
