MWD handlers are 39th Security Forces Squadron (39 SFS) personnel trained to use a
specialized piece of equipment. Because of the time and effort required to keep a team
proficient, employ the handler and MWD as a "team" and assign appropriate posts and duties.
Avoid posting an MWD handler without their dog except for medical reasons. While unit
manning shortfalls may require this as a last resort, keep it to a bare minimum, as it could rapidly
create an adverse effect on MWD proficiency. Note: 39 SFS supervisors with dog teams in their

     break, leave, or a projected TDY during this time, then records will be due on his or her last
     duty day. The record example, (continuity book) provides guidelines for proper
     documentation within MWD records.
     1.10.8. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) If assigned a detector dog, explosive or drug (P/EDD or
     P/DDD), the handler will be assigned on-call (if required) detector team duties. Alcoholic

   unless excused by the 39 SFS/S3K staff.
1.11. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) On-Duty Handler. Responsible to ensure maintenance of

                                             Chapter 2

                               PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Purpose of MWD Program. MWDs provide Security Forces the capability to enforce
military laws and regulations, suppress the use of illegal drugs, detect explosives, and protect
installations and resources during peacetime, war, and in support of operations other than war.
2.2. MWD Authorizations, Requisitions, and Dispositions.
   2.2.1. For guidance on requisition and disposition of MWDs, see AFMAN 23-110, Volume
   2, Part 2, Chapters 9 and 22, USAF Supply Manual and AFJI 23-224 DOD Military Working
   Dog (MWD) Program.
         2.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If a MWD is medically unable to perform duties, Kennel
         masters will need to obtain a one (1) year out letter from the base veterinarian that
         includes the canine’s prognosis and the life expectancy. This letter will be submitted with
         the AF FM 601 request, "Equipment Action Request" with a courtesy copy to HQ
         USAFE/A7SOI MWD Action Officer.
         2.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Due to the mission and operations tempo within the theatre,
         USAFE will not accept Narcotic Only (NSN: 8820-01-271-3829) or Explosive Only
         MWDs (NSN: 8820-00-043-3526) without the approval of HQ USAFE A7S. The MWD
         must be capable of dual certification at the base level. EDD/NDD Only MWDs within
         USAFE will be replaced through attrition with dual purpose MWDs when the single
         purpose MWD is no longer able to perform its duties
         2.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Upon ordering an MWD, forward the order requisition
         number to HQ USAFE/A7SOI, MWD Action Officer.
   2.2.2. As a baseline, installations are authorized 4 to 6 explosive detector dogs. Drug
   detector dogs will not exceed one-third of the unit’s total MWD authorizations. Exceptions
   may be based on operational requirements, existing manpower/MWD authorizations, base
   population and geography, or other unit-specific requirements. Exceptions and changes will
   be staffed as variances and approved by the MAJCOM A7S and must be coordinated through
   HQ AFSFC. Standards will specify the manpower authorizations for kennel masters,
   trainers, and handlers. The wing manpower office will validate MWD manpower
   authorizations. However, the following matrix is a recommended kennel leadership and
   support mix based on the number of authorized dogs:

Table 2.1. Recommended MWD Section Manpower

      2.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The MWD standard capability ratio is 4-5 patrol/explosive
      dogs and two patrol/narcotic dogs per installation except as addressed in Table 2.2 as
      MAJCOM approved variances. Forward variance packages with full justification to HQ

Note 1: MWDs can be single purpose for host nation reasons
Note 2: P/NDDs assigned to the UK provide mutual base support
Note 3: Unit supports Vogelweh and Sembach
2.3. Certification of MWD Handlers, Kennel Masters, and Trainers:
   2.3.1. MWD handlers must be graduates of the 341 TRS MWD Handler Course. Training
   done by private businesses or civilian police departments is not a substitute for the DOD
   MWD handler course.
   2.3.2. Personnel, regardless of rank, who laterally retrain to become MWD handlers, must
   complete the MWD Handler Course and enter upgrade training to the ―5‖ skill level. Before
   being awarded the 3P051A Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), the MWD handler must
   complete all upgrade requirements, including the MWD Handler Career Development
   Course, and all task items for the ―5‖ skill level in the MWD Handler Career Field Education
   and Training Plan.
   2.3.3. Kennel masters and trainers must be graduates of the 341 TRS MWD Trainer/Kennel
   Masters Course or be scheduled to attend within 90 days of assignment as kennel master or
   trainer. To be eligible to attend this course, personnel must be awarded the AFSC 3P051A.
2.4. Permanent Administrative Records. The kennel master maintains the following
permanent administrative records on MWDs:
   2.4.1. DD Form 1834, Military Working Dog Service Record. The 341 TRS initiates this
   form, which stays with the dog throughout its lifetime. If the form must be redone, attach the
   original to the new form.
 14                              AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011


   2.4.2. AF Form 321, Military Working Dog Training and Utilization Record.
      2.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) MWDs should be used every day their assigned handlers are
      working. Make an entry on the reverse of AF Form 321, Military Working Dog Training
      and Utilization Record, or AF Form 323, Military Working Dog Training and Utilization
      Record for Drug/Explosive Detector Dogs, explaining periods of non-use. Use a separate
      sheet of paper as a continuation sheet for the AF Form 323. AF Form 321 is not required
      for small breed detector dogs.
   2.4.3. AF Form 323, Military Working Dog Training and Utilization Record for
   Drug/Explosive Detector Dogs.
   2.4.4. AF Form 324, Military Working Dog Program Status Report. This report is due to
   HQ AFSFC quarterly through the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer. NOTE: Refer to the
   AFMAN 31-219, USAF Military Working Dog (MWD) Program, for specific information on
   these and other program specific forms.
      2.4.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Route the AF Form 324, Military Working Dog Program
      Status Report, through HQ USAFE/A7SOI, MWD Action Officer, to arrive no later than
      10 January, 10 April, 10 July, and 10 October each year or whenever there is a change to
      the MWD data, i.e. deployment category, handler status, certification, MWD
      losses/gains, Kennel master (KM)/Trainer changes, etc. Units will also provide the names
      of any 3P0X1A or SEI 311 personnel within the unit but not assigned to the MWD
      Section as well as the deployment status of each MWD (CAT 1-4) as determined by the
      kennel master and servicing veterinarian.
2.5. Safety Procedures. Safety procedures must be followed to protect MWDs as well as
people who come in contact with dogs. Safety rules include:
   2.5.1. Establish and enforce controls to prevent MWDs from getting loose in the MWD
   Kennel Facility.
   2.5.2. Keep a safe distance between MWD teams.
   2.5.3. Do not use a leash to secure a MWD to any object.
   2.5.4. Before entering veterinary clinics, permission will be granted by the clinic staff.
   Muzzle dog before entering.
   2.5.5. Check dog frequently if it is left unattended in a temporary kennel or shipping crate.
   2.5.6. Use only the leather collar and kennel chain to stake a dog out.
   2.5.7. Do not secure the dog to any movable object, especially a vehicle.
   2.5.8. Do not stake the dog out where it could injure itself or others.
   2.5.9. Put dogs in the shade during hot weather and ensure adequate water is available.
   2.5.10. Remove leather collar and choke chain while dogs are in kennel run. The leather
   collar will remain on the MWD when kenneled in a vari-kennels/shipping crates.
   2.5.11. Use a ―one-way system‖ in the kennel. This system may be shown by ground/wall
   signs or explained in the kennel operating instructions.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                   15


   2.5.12. Provide bilingual safety instructions for local national personnel performing kennel
   duties where applicable.
   2.5.13. Handlers will maintain a short leash when in close proximity (six feet) to other
   personnel.
   2.5.14. When an MWD team could unexpectedly encounter a bystander, such as walking or
   running around blind corners, using stairs, or passing an open door, the handler will warn
   others by announcing ―DOG COMING AROUND‖ – ―DOG COMING BY‖ – ―DOG
   COMING UP/DOWN‖.
   2.5.15. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Water hoses will be rolled after every use.
   2.5.16. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) MWD equipment will be inspected for serviceability prior
   to use. During training scenarios, if equipment becomes unsafe, training will be terminated
   until the equipment is repaired or replaced.
   2.5.17. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) MWDs will be kept on leash except when directed
   otherwise, for training or during an actual bite and hold situation.
   2.5.18. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Handlers will not allow people to pet MWDs.
2.6. Transporting MWDs in Vehicles.
   2.6.1. Vehicle Markings. Mark MWD vehicles IAW TO 36-1-191/ Technical and
   Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance, Chap 2.84.6.4. In foreign countries,
   the sign must also be written in the language of the host country. Do not use signs in
   deployed hostile locations.
   2.6.2. Four-door full sized vehicles are best suited for MWD operations. Mobile MWD
   teams should be assigned a law enforcement full size 4-door sedan or other full size 4-door
   passenger-type vehicle (Sport/Utility or station wagon). While on patrol, the dog may be
   off leash in the rear seat area. Never tie the dog to the vehicle. Use a stable platform (with a
   nonskid surface) to help the dog maintain balance. Commercial canine vehicle inserts are
   recommended for use in assigned vehicles.
   2.6.3. MWDs may be transported in a portable kennel or shipping crate in the bed of a truck
   without a camper shell for short trips on base only. Examples would be to the veterinary
   clinic or MWD demonstrations, etc. Pickup trucks are not to be used for daily operations
   with the MWD in the bed. When using a pickup truck to transport a MWD in a portable
   kennel or shipping crate, they must be secured to the bed of the truck.
   2.6.4. MWDs may be transported in privately owned vehicles (POV) with prior approval
   from the CSF. Approval must be in writing and POVs will only be used as a last resort for
   emergency purposes, not convenience.
   2.6.5. Vehicles used to routinely transport MWDs must be air-conditioned.
   2.6.6. MWD vehicles used for patrol will be separate and distinct from the kennel support
   vehicle(s) used for transportation of explosive training aids and other support functions.
   2.6.7. Do not transport MWD in any vehicle that has been used to transport stray animals
   until the vehicle has been thoroughly sanitized according to veterinarian instructions. Do not
 16                             AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011


   use MWD handlers or kennel support personnel to capture stray animals or maintain base
   stray animal shelters or pet boarding facilities.
   2.6.8. Do not leave dogs unattended in vehicles. Exceptions: If the mission requires it and
   there is no other alternative or if directed by competent authority (Kennel Master, Flight
   Chief, Flight Leader, etc). In these situations, the dog must be left in a marked MWD
   vehicle. Additionally, the handler must set the parking brake, leave the engine running, set
   the thermostat for the appropriate climate and ensure the fan is on high, secure the vehicle,
   and have a means (spare key) to immediately access the vehicle if the dog should become
   distressed. MWDs should be checked on every 15 minutes should they be left in a vehicle
   unattended. Leaving an MWD unattended in a vehicle will be a last resort.
   2.6.9. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Support Vehicles. A kennel support vehicle (any vehicles
   used for MWDs) will be assigned to and maintained by the MWD Section. When not in use
   by section personnel, vehicles will be parked at the kennels.
      2.6.9.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) The ranking on-duty MWD handler is responsible for
      accountability of all vehicles assigned as MWD patrol vehicles, to include signing the AF
      Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, and maintaining proper
      sanitation.
2.7. Shipping MWDs.
2.7. (USAFE) Shipping MWDs. Contact the individual Airline Carriers when transiting to,
from, or through Frankfurt Airport to ensure the crate requirements are met and proper
paperwork is completed.
   2.7.1. A veterinary health certificate must accompany the dog when it is shipped across state
   lines or international borders. Health certificates are valid for 10 days only. If travel is
   delayed, issue another certificate.
   2.7.1. (USAFE) The L 266/13 Veterinary Certificate is required to be completed for
   commercial movement of animals through Frankfurt Airport. MWDs are considered
   commercial.
   2.7.2. When shipping dogs in crates, mark the top of the crate with the name and tattoo of
   the dog. Note that the kennel should only be opened by a qualified handler. Include
   information on how to contact the handler accompanying the dog in case of emergency.
   Markings should be large enough to read from a safe distance. The top and sides of the
   crates should be labeled ―Danger – Military Working Dog.‖ Bi-lingual warnings should be
   utilized when shipping MWDs to overseas locations.
   2.7.3. Load crates for maximum ventilation and never place baggage on top of or around
   crate. Never place the crate on top of other baggage or stack crates more than two high. Do
   not load dogs into crates which have been standing in the sun. When transporting MWDs in
   shipping crates during hot weather, use air-conditioned or well-ventilated vehicles. Make
   sure there is an adequate supply of fresh water for the dogs. Do not lock shipping crates;
   however, make sure the crates cannot be opened inadvertently.
   2.7.4. When traveling with MWDs, they should be referred to as ―Federal Service Dogs‖.
   2.7.5. Ship the dog as excess baggage when the team travels on commercial aircraft. Dogs
   will travel in the cargo hold of commercial aircraft. Handlers will stay with assigned MWD
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                 17


  and will make every effort to ensure MWD is being loaded onto the same flight. Ask airline
  stewards/stewardess prior to departure to check if MWD is loaded into the cargo hold of the
  aircraft. The only exception is if the airline imposes a heat/cold embargo, or small regional
  airports that do not accept large kennels. In this case, dogs may travel in the passenger cabin
  with the handler, but must be muzzled and on leash, under continuous control of the handler,
  for the duration of the flight and only as a last resort.
  2.7.5. (USAFE) MWDs transiting through Africa are considered manifested cargo. Ensure
  to contact the Airline Carrier to obtain proper shipping requirements prior to departure to
  minimize delay.
     2.7.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Ensure crates used for shipping purposes are in accordance
     with local customs procedures for transport. Coordinate with the customs section of all
     countries the MWD will transit.
  2.7.6. When MWDs are shipped unaccompanied, kennel masters will check with the base
  transportation office and complete all required forms. The shipper will attach detailed
  instructions to the crate on how to feed and water MWDs. The MWD must be attended until
  it is loaded onboard the aircraft.
  2.7.7. Handlers will escort and take care of MWDs moved on military aircraft. Contact local
  passenger service representatives for instructions. If kennel facilities are required during
  stopovers at other bases, coordinate in advance with the kennel master. Do not route MWDs
  through Guam, United Kingdom, or other locations with animal quarantine regulations,
  unless MWD is being assigned to MWD sections in these locations. MWDs entering the
  European Union (EU) (see attachment 4) from countries not listed in the Regulation of the
  European Parliament and the Council of European Union, Annex II part C of Regulation
  (EC) No 998/2003 (attachment 5) are required to be accompanied by:
     2.7.7.1. EU Form 998 – Veterinary Certificate for domestic dogs, cats and ferrets
     entering the European Community for non-commercial movements.                Ask your
     veterinarian for a copy of the form for the specific country to which you are traveling.
     You can also contact the US State Department or the embassy of the country to which
     you are traveling and request an EU Form 998. You can often get the form mailed or
     faxed to you from embassy personnel.
     2.7.7.2. Proof of a rabies neutralizing anti-body vaccination or revaccination if
     applicable per the recommendation of the manufacturing lab, with an inactivated vaccine
     of at least one antigenic unit per dose.
     2.7.7.3. A copy of the dogs Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization (FAVN) test
     results.

                                             Chapter 3

                           CONTROLLING AND USING MWDS

3.1. Controlling MWDs. Handlers will maintain positive control of their MWD at all times.
When applicable, handlers will ensure persons are warned of the potential dangers associated
with an MWD. Do not allow people to pet MWDs.
   3.1.1. Keep MWDs on leash except when they must chase and/or bite and hold a suspect or
   search an unoccupied building. Always maintain positive control of dogs when off leash.
   Before releasing the dog to search a suspected building, give a verbal warning stating the dog
   is about to be released.
   3.1.2. During the following situations, handlers must warn people that their dog is trained to
   bite with or without command:
       3.1.2.1. Challenging an individual.
       3.1.2.2. Approaching a suspect.
       3.1.2.3. Checking a person's identification.
       3.1.2.4. Participating in any situation that requires the handler to divert attention from
       control of the dog.
   3.1.3. Relinquish control of the dog only to other trained handlers or veterinary personnel
   who are competent to handle the animal. Should no other qualified handler or vet be
   available, muzzle the MWD and relinquish control to any Security Forces personnel so the
   MWD can be transported back to the kennel facility.
3.2. Releasing MWDs. Release of an MWD to bite or allowing it to bite is considered use of
force, although is not considered use of deadly force. Use the reasonable amount of force
necessary to accomplish the task. (For further information on how and where the MWD fits into
the overall use of force spectrum, refer to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
Personnel.)
   3.2.1. MWD teams will be validated through training that the dog will ―stand-off‖ upon
   command and obey the command ―OUT‖. If a MWD performs unsatisfactorily in either of
   these tasks, the unit Operations Officer or higher must issue a ―no release‖ order to the
   handler, specifically outlining the dog will not be released to affect an apprehension under
   any circumstances. Post this order in the MWD’s permanent records until the dog has been
   properly trained and reevaluated satisfactorily at which time the ―no release‖ order may be
   rescinded. The dog may remain operational during the remedial training only after being
   issued the ―no release order‖. (See para 7.1.4.)
   3.2.2. Before releasing an MWD, make sure the dog has identified the same target that the
   handler intends for it to bite and hold. Give the warning order, "Halt or I will release my
   dog.‖ In foreign countries, also give this order in the primary language of the host country.
   Overseas units must include training in the host nation language warning order in their MWD
   handler certification program. Also, warn bystanders to cease all movement before releasing
   the dog.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                     19


       3.2.2.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) When release of a MWD is imminent, suspects will be
       given the following host nation challenge: ―Halt! Security Forces. Halt or I will release
       my dog. Dur! Dur!, Polis. Dur Aksi takdirde kopegirim birkirim!‖
   3.2.3. The handler must follow the dog as closely as possible when the MWD is released to
   bite and hold. Once the suspect stops or indicates surrender, call the dog off pursuit. If the
   dog fails to come OUT and assume the GUARD or HEEL position, regain immediate control
   of the dog. Use extreme caution when removing an MWD from a suspect. If necessary,
   choke the MWD off the individual. Do not jerk or pull the dog. Regain and keep leash
   control of the dog until it has become calm enough to obey the commands to HEEL and
   STAY.
   3.2.4. Handlers will not release their dogs if the suspect is not in sight, except as specified in
   paragraph 3.1.1. Handlers will not release MWDs in areas where children are present, except
   as a last resort short of the use of deadly force. Do not release MWDs into a crowd of
   people.
3.3. Using MWDs. Each CSF will establish local procedures on using MWDs. These
procedures must conform to this instruction, applicable Status of Forces Agreements, or other
country-to-country agreements.
   3.3.1. The ―one-handler, one-dog‖ rule is the norm when assigning and matching dog teams.
   However, there are exceptions to this rule. When a handler is on temporary duty (TDY) or
   on leave, it is the kennel master’s responsibility to ensure the dog is regularly exercised and
   groomed and that proficiency training is conducted. Also, during an emergency situation
   (bomb threat, etc), the kennel master or trainer may use another handler’s dog (explosive
   detector dog only), if a certified handler is not immediately available. The decision to do so
   rests with the kennel master based upon knowledge of the dog and of the situation. Also,
   during personnel shortages, a qualified handler may work more than one dog only after ALL
   assigned handlers and kennel personnel have been assigned to dogs.
   3.3.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) MWD Team Employment and Utilization at Incirlik Air
   Base (AB):
       3.3.2.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Program Restrictions. MWDs will not be used to
       conduct detection searches on people. In addition, AF directives and host nation, 10th
       Tanker Base Command General Security Plan (Joint Security Plan) have imposed the
       following restrictions:
       3.3.2.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Patrol dog training will not be conducted in the
       vicinity of the base perimeter, or areas owned and controlled by the host nation.
       3.3.2.3. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Do not conduct off-leash training in highly populated
       areas, housing areas, Base Exchange, Commissary, and the Medical clinic during duty
       hours.
       3.3.2.4. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Use of pinch collars will not be utilized on MWDs
       without prior authorization of 39 SFS/S3K or MWD trainer(s).
20                            AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011


     3.3.2.5. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Gunfire Training. All provisions outlined in AFI 31-
     207, Arming and Use Of Force by Air Force Personnel, regarding the safe handling and
     use of firearms will be adhered to. Only those personnel designated in writing by the
     DFC will be authorized to sign out a .38 caliber revolver and/or M-4 carbine rifle from
     the armory. 39 SFS/S3K will contact Turkish Air Force (TURAF) through the 39 SFS
     Interpreter prior to training.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                    21


                                           Chapter 4

                                  MWD TEAM TRAINING

4.1. MWD Team General Proficiency Training. As an Air Force standard, each duty cycle
should include the training needed to maintain team proficiency. When possible, conduct
training on post. Kennel masters will develop an Optimum Training Schedule (OTS) for each
dog. Each OTS will state the minimum proficiency training required per dog, per month, for
each required task based on MWD team’s proficiency level. Minimum training may change
depending on changes in the team’s proficiency level.
   4.1.1. Kennel masters and trainers will conduct patrol and explosives/narcotics detection
   training. Patrol training includes training on the obstacle course, unless the local veterinarian
   waives the requirement for medical reasons. See AFMAN 31-219 for training procedures on
   gunfire, obedience, and aggression.
       4.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Annotate temporary waivers for the obstacle course on the
       AF FM 321. Annotate permanent waivers in the medical records.
   4.1.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) To enhance team proficiency and familiarity with base
   resources, training will be conducted in all areas of the base. Exceptions are facilities and/or
   areas exclusively under Turkish control, and areas adjacent to the base perimeter.
   4.1.3. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Training Schedule. A training schedule, prepared by the
   Trainer and/or 39 SFS/S3K, will be posted at the kennels. Handlers must update the MWD
   status board, located in the handlers’ office, for the training sessions in which they were
   present prior to departing for the day of and/or after training.
       4.1.3.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) MWD handlers are responsible for meeting their
       assigned MWD’s optimum training requirements.
4.2. MWD Team Detection Training. The 341 TRS establishes the type of response and
reward for each initially certified dog. Notify the 341 TRS Dog Training Section of any change
to the response or reward. Drug detector dogs (DDDs) will not be trained to detect explosives
and explosive detector dogs (EDDs) will not be trained to detect drugs. Do not train drug and
explosive detector dogs in the same areas unless at least 72 hours have elapsed.
   4.2.1. With MAJCOM MWD Action Officer approval, field units may locally train a patrol
   dog that shows potential as a narcotic or explosive detector dog. However, explosive
   detector dog washouts may never enter into drug detector training and vice versa. Once local
   training is completed, the dog must complete initial certification as a detector dog. Initial
   certification requirements are more stringent than probable cause certifications. Only the 341
   TRS can certify locally-trained explosive detector dogs. The requesting unit or MAJCOM
   will pay for the TDY expenses. Locally-trained DDDs may be certified by a Technical
   Sergeant or above, knowledgeable of the MWD Program and who is a graduate of the 341
   TRS MWD Handler Course or previous equivalent course. Request guidance from the 341
   TRS, Dog Training Section, for specific training protocol and certification requirements.
       4.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Forward request to train and certify dogs to HQ
       USAFE/A7SOI, MWD Action Officer.
 22                              AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011


   4.2.2. After locally-trained detector dog teams are certified, the unit will forward a letter to
   the responsible MAJCOM MWD Action Officer requesting a change in National Stock
   Number (NSN). The MAJCOM MWD Action Officer will forward an endorsed copy of the
   letter to the 341 TRS and return the original to the unit. Following MAJCOM MWD Action
   Officer endorsement, the unit will process the request through base supply channels. Base
   supply will assign the appropriate NSN and provide the information to the unit. The unit will
   then annotate the new stock number on the DD Form 1834.
       4.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Forward certification letter to HQ USAFE/A7SOI, MWD
       Action Officer.
4.3. (Added-USAFE) MWD Team Patrol Training. With HQ USAFE A7S approval, field
units may locally train a detector dog as a patrol dog. Once local training is completed, the dog
must complete initial certification as a patrol dog. Only the 341 TRS can certify locally-trained
patrol dogs. The requesting unit or MAJCOM will pay for the TDY expenses. Request guidance
from the 341 TRS, Dog Training Section, for specific training protocol and certification
requirements.
   4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) After locally trained patrol dog teams are certified, forward a letter
   to the responsible MAJCOM requesting a change in National Stock Number (NSN). The
   MAJCOM will forward an endorsed copy of the letter to the 341st TRS and return the
   original to the unit. If approved, the unit will process the request through base supply
   channels. When approved at base supply level, annotate the new stock number change on the
   DD Form 1834.
   4.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Forward certification letter to HQ USAFE/A7SOI, MWD Action

                              EXPLOSIVE TRAINING AIDS

5.1. Explosive Training Aid Safety Precautions. Handling explosives is dangerous. Follow
mandatory safety requirements when training EDDs. Do not conduct training unless detailed
operating instructions that include safety procedures are developed. Explosives safety and
handling instructions must be coordinated through the installation safety office.
   5.1.1. The CSF will ensure involved personnel receive annual training in safely storing,
   transporting, and handling explosive training aids. Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) or
   munitions safety personnel will conduct the training. If these personnel are unavailable, the
   kennel master will develop an annual safety briefing (with wing safety office assistance) and
   document training on all personnel involved in EDD training. Briefings will address
   requirements in AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, AFMAN 91-201,
   Explosive Safety Standards, and Technical Order (TO) 11A20-16-7, Canine Explosive Scent
   Kit. Take the following actions before removing explosive training aids and setting up
   training exercises:
      5.1.1.1. Coordinate in advance with the training location facility owners to minimize
      disruption of operations.
      5.1.1.2. Contact the base weather office before each training session. Do not conduct
      training when an electrical storm is within 5 miles of the training area.
          5.1.1.2.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) If overcome by an electrical storm, training
          operations will be terminated immediately and the explosives will be returned to the

disinterested person, E-5 or above or civil service equivalent (excluding contractors) appointed
by the CSF in writing, will weigh training aids monthly. Conduct the weight check using a
calibrated scale. The disinterested person may be assigned to the unit, but must be a different
person each month. Record the weights of the training aids in grams, in a bound (book type)
notebook. The disinterested person verifies the exact weight of each training aid and compares it
to the weight recorded on the AF Form 1205. The disinterested person also reviews the training
aid issue/turn-in log.
   6.7.1. The CSF directs an inquiry according to AFI 31-206, Security Forces Investigations
   Program, if there is evidence of tampering or an unexplained loss/gain of more than:
       6.7.1.1. 0.5 gram of methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, MDMA or hashish training aids
       of all sizes.
       6.7.1.2. Two grams of marijuana from an individual training aid weighing 20 grams, one
       gram from aids weighing 10 grams, 0.5 grams from aids weighing five grams, and 0.2

       serve as the witness verifying the issue and return of the aid. If signs of damage or
       tampering are present, contact 39 SFS/S3K.
6.8. Drug Training Aid Inventories and Audits. As a minimum, conduct a drug training aid
no-notice inventory annually or when custodians change. The installation commander or
designee appoints a disinterested person (master sergeant or above or civil service equivalent) to
inventory all drug training aids and to conduct an audit of the Controlled Substance Training Aid
Accountability Folders. The appointee cannot be any person who has conducted the audit in
previous years. Forward the results of the inventory/audit to the installation commander
(through the installation CSF) or designee for review. The primary custodian will maintain the
results of each audit/inventory for 1 year after training aids have been recalled by
AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX and are no longer accountable by the unit.
6.9. Control of Drug Training Aids. The CSF identifies, in writing, personnel authorized to
sign out, possess, and use drug training aids. The custodian keeps a log of all training aids issued
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                    31


and returned using a hard bound book with numbered pages or a book with pre-numbered pages.
If a new book is started, keep the old drug training aid log in the safe for no less than 2 years.
The log will include each drug training aid number; date; time; signature of issuing person;
signature of person receiving the training aid; signature of person returning the aid; and signature
of person verifying the return of the training aid. The person who receives the training aid is the
only one who can return it, unless a bonafide emergency directly involves the person who signed
the training aid out. The primary/alternate custodian will review the log weekly.
   6.9.1. The primary custodian will ensure training aids are returned the same duty tour they
   were signed out unless the CSF, operations officer, or other competent authority grants a
   special authorization in advance.
   6.9.2. The primary custodian will ensure personnel authorized to use drug training aids are
   trained on the protection requirements for controlled substances. Annotate the training in the
   individual’s OJT records. Positively control training aids at all times.
   6.9.3. Authorize, if necessary, MWD handlers to transport and use training aids when TDY.
   Record the authorization to possess drug training aids, including specific types, quantities,
   and training aid numbers on the handler's TDY orders.
   6.9.4. Send drug training aids to the TDY destination after the DOD handler arrives, or
   hand-carry as appropriate.
   6.9.5. If travelling to destination requires interrupted travel, coordinate in advance with the
   nearest military installation or civilian police agency to secure training aids. Use the AF
   Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, as documentation.
   6.9.6. (Added-USAFE) Do not transport drug-training aids across international borders.
6.10. Change of Primary Custodian. When a US-based unit’s primary drug custodian is
departing, the unit will prepare a legal power of attorney for the purpose of enabling the alternate
custodian or other named person to order DEA forms and to send and receive drug training aids.
It is not necessary to immediately apply for a new DEA registration certificate. This can be done
by including the new custodian’s name when processing the next application to renew DEA
registration.
   6.10.1. File the certified power of attorney with the drug custodian appointment letter until
   the primary custodian returns, or a new custodian is appointed and the new DEA registration
   is received. Send copies of the power of attorney or new DEA registration to AFIP/AFMES/
   FORTOX.
   6.10.2. Overseas units send AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX Form, Transfer of MWD Team DEA
   Registrant, to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. Form may be obtained on the DOD MWD Program
   Management Branch HQ AFSFC website at https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil or directly from
   AFIP/AFMES via email at MWD@afip.osd.mil.
6.11. Training with Additional Substances . Training with odors or substances other than
those listed in paragraph 6.2.2 must be approved by the Air Force MWD Program Office. The
request package must be coordinated through the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer and include
documentation supporting the need for the additional substance (OSI Threat Analysis, etc). If
approved, all requirements of this chapter must be adhered to procure the new substance from
AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX.

                                           Chapter 7

         MWD PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND VALIDATION TESTING

7.1. Standards. MWD teams are measured against minimum performance standards. Specific
tasks are assigned different degrees of importance: Critical, Semi-Critical, and Non-Critical.
   7.1.1. Critical tasks are STAY, FALSE RUN, FIELD INTERVIEW, BITE AND HOLD,
   RELEASE BITE, OUT AND GUARD, STAND-OFF, SEARCH AND REATTACK,
   SEARCH AND CALL BY, BUILDING SEARCH, SCOUTING AND PATROLING,
   VEHICLE PATROL AND SMALL ARMS FIRE. The operational effectiveness of teams
   failing critical tasks will be degraded. MWDs not meeting minimum standards on three
   consecutive training days without reason must enter extensive remedial training. If remedial
   training is unsuccessful, take the action outlined in paragraph 7.3.
   7.1.2. Semi-critical tasks are SIT, DOWN, HEEL, and ESCORT. The operational
   effectiveness of teams failing semi-critical tasks will not be seriously degraded. These teams
   must, however, receive corrective action to eliminate or reduce the deficiency.
   7.1.3. The OBSTACLE COURSE is the only non-critical task. Failure to meet non-critical
   task standards may affect the team’s efficiency, but will not degrade their overall
   performance.
   7.1.4. Conduct patrol dog task evaluations at least annually. Refer to the AFMAN 31-219
   for guidance on initial and follow-on performance standards. If evaluation results in failure
   of any critical task, the team will be entered immediately into extensive remedial training. If
   the MWD has performed unsatisfactorily in the ―stand-off‖ or ―out‖ command, a ―no release‖
   order will be issued by unit Operations Officer or higher to the handler and posted in the
   MWD’s permanent records until MWD has been properly trained and reevaluated
   satisfactorily. MWD may remain operational during the remedial training when order has
   been issued. If reasonable training efforts are unsuccessful, follow guidance in paragraph
   7.3.
   7.1.5. (Added-USAFE) The use of electronic training collars (shock collars) is prohibited.
   This equipment, in any form, will not be used on any military working dog for any reason.
7.2. Validation Testing and Certification Testing. MWD teams are measured against
minimum search standards. Validation and certification testing will be conducted on all MWD
teams when applicable.
   7.2.1. Validation testing is a tool to evaluate detector dog team proficiency. Do not use
   validation tests as additional training exercises. Dog teams must be validated prior to
   operational use, deployment or TDY in support of USSS or DOS. Validation testing will be
   done annually or whenever a new dog team is established. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for
   guidance on conducting validation trials.
   7.2.2. Certification testing is used only as basis for establishing probable cause for issuance
   of a search warrant at home station. MWD teams must be validated by the kennel master
   prior to certification. MWD teams do not have to be certified to deploy or go TDY in
   support of USSS or DOS. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for guidance on conducting
   certification.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                     33


7.3. Formal Decertification Process. If a dog fails to maintain detection standards or is unable
to perform any of the critical patrol dog tasks satisfactorily, the kennel master conducts
additional training to correct deficiencies and documents the actions taken.
   7.3.1. The kennel master begins formal decertification to change the dog’s National Stock
   Number to show its actual capability when:
       7.3.1.1. Long-term or unacceptable medical problems prevent the dog from performing
       critical patrol dog tasks. If the dog is a patrol/detector, use the dog as long as the medical
       problem does not interfere with the detection role.
       7.3.1.2. If little progress is made within 30 days, or the kennel master determines the
       problems are not correctable.
       7.3.1.3. Upon receiving a newly assigned dog from the 341 TRS which cannot perform
       one or more critical tasks within 120 days of assignment. Contact a 341 TRS MWD
       evaluator before starting a decertification package.
   7.3.2. If decertification is necessary, the kennel master will prepare a decertification
   package. Refer to AFI 23-224(I) for final disposition guidance. The CSF will indorse the
   package and send it to the respective MAJCOM MWD Action Officer and the 341 TRS. The
   package will include:
       7.3.2.1. The apparent cause of the problem.
       7.3.2.2. A statement from the veterinarian if the dog's physical condition is the cause of
       the problem.
       7.3.2.3. A summary of retraining efforts.
       7.3.2.4. Copies of AF Forms 321 and 323 and DD Form 1834.
       7.3.2.5. The dog's minimum, maximum, current, and estimated weight range (from
       medical records)
       7.3.2.6. Past and current reward schedules.
       7.3.2.7. Other information relating to the problem. Include the dog's response and
       percentage of efficiency on each trained odor for detector dogs.
   7.3.3. The MAJCOM MWD Action Officer ensures the decertification package is properly
   justified and every effort has been made to correct the problem locally. Exceptions may be
   made for a dog's failure to upgrade during follow-on training based on all available facts. In
   these cases, the package is annotated and returned to the unit. If an exception is not granted,
   the package is forwarded to the 341 TRS for review.
   7.3.4. The 341 TRS helps field units correct training problems and recommends additional
   training as necessary. The 341 TRS reviews decertification actions to determine if the dog
   should be returned to the 341 TRS for evaluation. If the dog is returned, the 341 TRS may
   recommend de-certification, further training, or assign the dog to serve as a training aid at the
   school. If additional training corrects the problem, the dog will be recertified and with HQ
   Air Force MWD Program Management Office approval, returned to the original unit, or
   reassigned to another unit. DD Form 1834 will be annotated to reflect the reason for removal
   or decertification and the NSN is changed.

                                            Chapter 8

                                    MWD EMPLOYMENT

8.1. Law Enforcement. Patrol-certified MWDs seek, detect, bite and hold, and guard suspects
on command during patrol. They deter attack of and defend their handlers during threatening
situations. They can assist in crowd control and confrontation management, and search for
suspects and lost personnel, both indoors and outdoors.
8.2. Drug Suppression. Drug Detector Dog MWD teams are specially trained in drug detection
and support the Air Force goal of a drug-free environment. Their renowned capability to detect
illegal drugs deters drug use and possession, and is a valuable adjunct to a commander's other
tools such as urinalysis and investigation.
8.3. Explosive Detection. Explosive Detector Dog MWD teams are exceptionally valuable in
antiterrorism operations. They can detect unexploded ordnance, search areas during bomb
threats, and augment the EOD capability. Explosives detector dog teams are appropriate for
searching buildings, vehicles, baggage, packages, aircraft, etc. during threats, protection details,
or other routine or general sweeps. EDDs are not to be used to search suspicious unattended
packages or assess, examine, or clear items already identified as a suspected explosive item or
possible improvised device (IED). EDDs should not be used to validate the response of another
EDD or mechanical devices used to detect explosives. Searching refers to conducting a
systematic examination of an area, vehicle or other non-suspect items with EDD teams.
   8.3.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Bomb Threats. Upon notification of a bomb threat, the
   BDOC will dispatch an on-duty EDD team immediately. If there is not an EDD team
   available, the BDOC will begin recall of EDD handlers to respond. The BDOC will notify
   39 SFS/S3K via KM cell phone and/or MWD Trainer, who will determine if additional
   MWD personnel will be recalled. Responding personnel will be informed of the facility,
   approach route and any other pertinent information provided by the caller.
       8.3.1.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) MWD teams will not enter the facility and/or area 30
       minutes prior or 30 minutes following a given detonation time. If no time is given,
       MWD handler(s) accompanied by spotter(s) can assist EOD personnel in clearing the
       facility.
       8.3.1.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) EDD teams will be accompanied by a trained EDD
       handler and/or kennel master or trainer(s) while searching during a bomb threat.
8.4. Contingency Operations. In war fighting roles, MWD teams provide enhanced patrol and
detection ability to perimeter and point defense. In bare base operations, deploy MWDs as an
early warning system. Given the range of potential contingencies, drug and explosives detection
are also valuable added capabilities in these environments since they are patrol dogs first and
detector dogs second. Likewise, EDDs have become indispensable in the deployed unit’s force
protection plan. MWD teams can be used in flash (sudden or instantaneous) aerial traffic control
point operations, dismounted combat patrols, show of force, and cordon and search operations.
Under no circumstances will MWDs be used in the interrogation or interview of Enemy
Prisoners of War (EPW) or detainees. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for more guidance on
contingency operations.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                   35


   8.4.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Contingency Operations. During contingency operations
   the MWD section will initiate 12-hour shifts. 39 SFS/S3K will be a working member of the
   DFC planning staff and will provide guidance on the employment of MWDs.
       8.4.1.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) In addition, 39 SFS/S3K will:
           8.4.1.1.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Create Special Security Instructions (SSIs) as
           needed.
           8.4.1.1.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Assign posts for MWD handlers commensurate
           with the existing threat.
8.5. Physical Security. The MWD team can augment in detection roles, temporarily replace
inoperative sensor systems, patrol difficult terrain, and deter would-be aggressors. For further
information on the use of MWD teams in physical security operations, refer to AFI 31-101.
8.6. Employment. Select posts with first consideration given to the dog’s keen sense of smell.
Dogs are most effective during nighttime hours and in areas of minimal activity. Rotate MWD
teams through all appropriate posts to meet operational needs and to maintain proficiency of the
MWD team. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for further information on MWD employment.
   8.6.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) MWD teams will be assigned a base-wide patrol rather than
   a specific zone. It is the responsibility of 39 SFS/S3K and 39 SFS/S3 to ensure MWDs are
   posted in areas that will capitalize on their capabilities. Handlers will not be posted without
   their MWDs unless approved by 39 SFS/S3K or MWD is unable to work due to veterinarian
   orders. Any variations to the employment due to contingency or higher force protection
   conditions will be covered by the special security instructions.
8.7. Competition Outside DOD. MWD teams are encouraged to take part in public
demonstrations and competitions conducted by civil or military police agencies. Demonstrations
by explosive detector dogs are highly discouraged as it may generate prank bomb threats and
identify which dogs are EDDs. When competing in civilian competitions, handlers will not
allow their dogs to negotiate obstacles higher than those they have been trained on.
8.8. Searches. The person having command authority over all areas on the installation may
authorize detector dogs to search for drugs or explosives on the installation. The base staff judge
advocate (SJA) will provide guidance on conducting searches. Coordinate searches of postal
facilities with the base SJA. DO NOT use detector dogs to search a person.
   8.8.1. The official authorizing the search must be confident of the detector dog's ability to
   successfully detect the odor of drugs in the case of DDDs and explosives in the case of
   EDDs.
       8.8.1.1. To provide that assurance, maintain the following information for each detector
       dog in a probable cause folder:
       8.8.1.2. A general record of the training and experience of the team (AF Form 321).
       8.8.1.3. A detailed record showing the number of checks or searches, by date, locations,
       responses, and finds (AF Form 323).
       8.8.1.4. A record showing when the search authorizing authority reviewed these records.
       The search-granting authority or designee should review each folder annually and
       document the results by signature and date.
36                             AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011


     8.8.1.5. Prepare a memorandum verifying the search-granting authority or delegated
     authority witnessed a detection demonstration. Include the date, the substance used, and
     results of the team's effort. The demonstration includes each substance the dog is trained
     to detect and one residual odor test (DDDs only). The residual odor test demonstrates
     that dogs are not trained to detect the presence of substance but rather the odor associated
     with a particular substance. Certification, as required by this paragraph, is valid only on
     the installation(s) under command authority of the demonstration-witnessing search
     granting authority. NOTE: The witnessing of this demonstration may be delegated to the
     CSF. Furthermore, when there are multiple installations in the vicinity or other
     geographically separated areas, the search granting authority or CSF delegate may
     prepare a memorandum to the installation search granting authority for the neighboring
     installations. If the search granting authority is confident in the dog’s ability to detect
     trained odors, he/she indorses the memorandum indicating concurrence and subsequent
     search authority.
     8.8.1.6. The kennel master will prepare a quarterly summary statement confirming the
     reliability of each detector team. Include the total time spent by the team in actual and
     training searches in each area shown on the AF Form 323, and for each type of drug or
     explosive used. The summary must agree with other facts in the file and include the
     validation test percentage of accuracy. This record also accompanies MWD teams when
     on TDY.
  8.8.2. In the CONUS, use dogs to inspect or search military aircraft, cargo, household goods,
  and baggage. At special foreign clearance bases where customs inspections are conducted,
  use dogs to search the luggage of DOD and DOD-sponsored personnel and the luggage of
  other passengers and crew carried aboard DOD aircraft.
  8.8.3. DOD teams are authorized to provide detection support to civilian law enforcement
  agencies (CLEA) as long as the support incurs no cost to the government and does not impact
  on unit readiness. For further information on support to CLEAs and other non-DOD
  agencies, refer to Chapter 10.
  8.8.4. EDD teams primarily respond to explosive threats or serve as a deterrent through
  random searches. Use the following guidance when responding to bomb threats or situations
  where the presence of explosive devices is suspected.
  8.8.4. (USAFE) Never use Explosive Detector Dog teams to confirm or clear suspicious
  objects or packages. If an item is suspicious, initiate installation specific measures. Only
  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel are trained, equipped, and certified to render
  and declare an object safe.
     8.8.4.1. Evacuate the area depending on the threat received, local policy, and/or when
     ordered by base officials.
     8.8.4.2. Do not move or disturb anything unless it can positively be ruled out as an
     explosive device. Improvised explosive devices can be triggered many ways, including
     lifting, tilting, pushing, pulling, or by remote detonation devices.
     8.8.4.3. If lights or other electrical or mechanical appliances are on, leave them on. If
     lights are off, leave them off until the search is completed.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                 37


     8.8.4.4. Visually survey the entire area before starting a systematic search.
     8.8.4.5. Note areas where the dog shows significant interest but failed to give a response,
     so EOD can conduct follow-up searches.
     8.8.4.6. Do not touch or retrieve suspected objects or allow the dog to scratch, paw, or
     bite at the object.
     8.8.4.7. When the dog responds during an actual search, immediately mark the area and
     notify EOD personnel. Do not move, open, or tamper with any objects. Do not re-enter
     the area with the dog for the purpose of pinpointing or to further investigate the object.
     The use of a second dog to confirm or deny the response was legitimate should not be
     used as it will add unnecessary confusion and danger to the situation, especially if one
     MWD alerts and the other does not. EOD must be utilized to determine if the package or
     object is safe. If EOD personnel are not immediately available and you must neutralize a
     suspected explosive device (or limit the effects of a possible explosion), erect barricades
     of sandbags, mattresses, or other non-fragmenting material around the device.
     CAUTION: Do this only in cases of extreme necessity.
  8.8.5. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) MWD teams may initiate an inspection of U.S.-owned and
  control BDOC government facilities with or without prior authorization when possible
  criminal activity is present. Permissible search areas include, but are not limited to,
  dormitory common areas, work areas, industrial areas and/or any area where personnel
  conduct government work or business. Handlers should coordinate with building managers
  prior to initiating an inspection. Special considerations and/or restrictions are listed below.
     8.8.5.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Living Quarters: MWD teams will not conduct
     inspections of living quarters or living quarters within dormitories unless directed by a
     competent search-granting authority or appropriate legal reasons exist to conduct the
     inspection.
     8.8.5.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Postal Facilities. MWD teams will not conduct
     inspections unless directed by a competent search-granting authority or appropriate legal
     reasons exist to conduct the inspection.
     8.8.5.3. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Food Preparation Areas. Avoid these areas due to
     health reasons.
     8.8.5.4. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) 39th Medical Group (39 MDG). Prior to entry into the
     clinic, contact the Patient Affairs Officer (PAO). The PAO or designated representative
     escorts the detection team through the common areas of the facility. Avoid inspections
     during peak customer service hours as well as sterile areas within the facility.
     8.8.5.5. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Department of Defense Schools. Coordinate through
     the principal to conduct inspections of the school during normal duty hours.
     8.8.5.6. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Confinement. Coordinate through the 39th Security
     Forces Security, Confinement (39 SFS/S5LC) Non-Commissioned Officer In-Charge
     (NCOIC).
     8.8.5.7. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Joint United States (U.S.) and Turkish Facilities. Do
     not inspect these areas unless accompanied by a TURAF member. Prior to inspecting
     one of these facilities coordinate through the 39 SFS interpreter to have TURAF
38                            AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011


     assistance. If the request is denied, contact the 39th Air Base Wing Staff Judge Advocate
     (39 ABW/JA) for further assistance.
     8.8.5.8. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) If while conducting a search of the above area an
     MWD team gives a final response the following actions must take place:
         8.8.5.8.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) If a DDD gives a final response, secure the scene
         and notify the BDOC, who will in turn notify 39th Security Forces Squadron,
         Investigations Division (39 SFS/S2I) and 39 ABW/JA.
         8.8.5.8.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) If an EDD gives a final response, mark the
         location, evacuate the immediate area and move at least 500 feet from the suspected
         area or device. Notify the BDOC and remain on-scene to brief EOD or any other
         responding agency.
  8.8.6. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Courtesy Vehicle Checks. Checks conducted on vehicles
  that have been involved in an incident, e.g., returned/released to owner from Turkish
  Government as a result of larceny. DDD teams will perform courtesy vehicle checks, unless,
  EDD capabilities are needed and the vehicle is not an immediate threat to the installation.
  Checks will be conducted for active duty military members, dependents, and U.S. civilian
  employees of the base. To qualify for a courtesy vehicle inspection, requesters must be
  eligible based on the categories listed below:
     8.8.6.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Category 1: A used vehicle purchased within 10
     working days of the request. Owners must provide a bill of sale showing the date of
     purchase and the new owner’s name.
     8.8.6.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Category 2: Vehicles shipped into the country, by
     virtue of a Permanent Change of Station move, within 30 days of the vehicle being
     received by the owner or authorized person from its port of entry. Owners must provide
     a legible copy of Department of Defense (DD) Form 788, Private Vehicle Shipping
     Document for Automobile and/or DD Form 1252, U.S. Customs and Border Protection
     (CBP) Declaration for Personal Property Shipment.
     8.8.6.3. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Category 3: Vehicles that have been stolen and
     returned which can be verified by 39 SFS/S2I, Air Force Office of Special Investigations
     (AFOSI) or a civilian law enforcement agency. Owners have 10 working days to
     schedule a check after possession of their vehicle is regained.
     8.8.6.4. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Handlers will verify applicable documents listed
     above as well as a driver’s license, registration and proof of insurance. Do not conduct
     checks if documents required are not presented at the time of the check. Inform the
     vehicle owner that neither the MWD team nor any component of the DoD will be liable
     for any damage incurred during the check.
     8.8.6.5. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Annotate AF Form 323 and notify the BDOC for
     annotation in the 39 SFS Blotter.
     8.8.6.6. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) If a final response on a control BDOC substance
     occurs, the handler will seize the control BDOC substance and/or related paraphernalia

AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                               39


       vehicle make, model, color, license plate number, vehicle owner’s name, rank,
       organization, duty phone and results of the check. Notify AFOSI.
8.9. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Utilization. While patrolling, MWD teams will utilize the ride a
while, walk a while concept of patrolling to ensure MWDs remain conditioned and alert for duty.
In addition, each handler will:
   8.9.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Ensure MWDs are utilized a minimum of six hours for 8-
   hour shift or 10 hours for 12-hour shifts, unless otherwise directed by the 39 SFS/S3K staff
   and veterinarian. On-duty handlers will be accompanied by their assigned MWD at all times
   except in the clinic or in dining facilities.
   8.9.2. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Conduct a minimum of two foot patrols of the Vault Storage
   Area (VSA) during the hours of darkness. These patrols may be conducted internally. Any
   foot patrol and/or VSA checks must be annotated in the security blotter.
   8.9.3. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Conduct Random Anti-Terrorism Measures (RAMs) if
   scheduled during their tour of duty and record the time and location on AF Form 323. If
   previously approved times are not allowed by TURAF personnel, schedule a more
   appropriate time within the shift via SF interpreter. Make all necessary attempts to ensure
   that RAMs are conducted, unless extenuating circumstances arise. Contact the BDOC for
   any problems associated with RAMs.
   8.9.4. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) During vault operations, an MWD patrol will be present
   when required by Vault Operations Area Supervisor. An initial sweep of the Protective
   Aircraft Shelter with the Sole Vouching Authority will not be conducted until security is
   established. MWDs will also be utilized in the initial purging of area as well.
   8.9.5. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Conduct a minimum of three searches away from the
   Installation Entry Control Points (e.g. parking lots, dormitories and buildings under U.S.
   control and all associated common areas) every duty day.
   8.9.6. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) All MWD utilization should be documented in the 39 SFS
   Blotter as well as in the MWD’s Training and Utilization Records (AF Form 321/AF Form
   323).
8.10. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Large Vehicle Inspection Station (LVIS). All personnel
posted at the LVIS will comply with the current directives established by the Kennel Master or
higher. While posted they will maintain the highest standards as they will come in contact with
the local community. Operations will be conducted as follows:

                      KENNEL FACILITIES AND CARE OF MWDS

9.1. Kennel Facilities . A suitable MWD Kennel Facility, support equipment, and explosives
storage facilities (if EDDs are assigned) must be available before MWDs may be shipped to an
installation. Kennel facilities require:
   9.1.1. Adequate ventilation, cooling, and heating. Kennel temperature should range from 45
   degrees Fahrenheit to 85 degrees Fahrenheit with humidity in the range of 40% to 70%.
   Note: MWDs work more effectively and are more alert when the kennel temperature is
   close to the temperature of their working environment. Strive to maintain a kennel
   temperature within 10 degrees of the exterior temperature.
   9.1.2. Minimal noise levels. Do not locate MWD Kennel Facility near runways, taxiways,
   engine test cells, small arms ranges, or other areas where the time-weighted overall average
   sound pressure level for any 24-hour period exceeds 75 adjusted decibels.
   9.1.3. Areas without infestations of mosquitoes, ticks, and rodents.
   9.1.4. Coordinate new construction planning documents and renovation actions with the
   supporting veterinarian, local base civil engineer and Antiterrorism/Force Protection office.
   9.1.5. Proper kennel maintenance requires frequent inspection and correction of
   discrepancies. Kennel masters, trainers, and handlers must maintain the MWD Kennel
   Facility according to AFMAN 31-219.
   9.1.6. A secure training area is required for patrol and patrol/detector MWDs for advanced
   obedience and off-leash control training. The area should be close to the MWD Kennel
   Facility and meet the standards outlined in AFMAN 31-219
   9.1.7. Post all sides of the kennel and training areas with warning signs. Use the AFVA 125-
   21, Warning Military Working Dog Area Do Not Enter, or locally produced signs. In foreign
   countries, also translate signs into the host country language.
   9.1.8. Do not allow pets, stray animals, or unit mascots into the MWD facility or training
   area. Do not locate stray animal facilities with, or operate as part of, the MWD facility.
9.2. Care of MWDs. Arrange duty schedules of handlers and support personnel so the MWD
Kennel Facilities are continuously staffed, or such that at least one qualified handler is
immediately available. If a qualified handler is unavailable, the kennel master will train other
personnel to assist with non-duty hours facility checks and kennel support.
   9.2.1. If units have less than five MWDs or do not earn kennel support personnel, do the
   following when the MWD Kennel Facility is unattended:
       9.2.1.1. Keep a qualified MWD handler or trained kennel attendant on call. Use on-duty
       handlers for this purpose.
           9.2.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Provide procedures for obtaining non-duty hour medical
           care in kennel support instructions. For unmanned kennel facilities, ensure written
           procedures are available to the desk sergeant or on-call handler.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                 41


       9.2.1.2. Lock the kennel facility. Keep the keys at a specific location, such as the law
       enforcement desk, for emergency purposes. Secure kennel runs to prevent opening of the
       kennel run gate by the MWD.
           9.2.1.2.1. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) The combination to the exterior gate                is
           maintained in BDOC and will only be issued to the patrol responsible for conducting
           the kennel checks. This combo will not be issued to anyone else without 39 SFS/S3K
           staff approval.
       9.2.1.3. Check the kennel facility and each MWD at a minimum of every 4 hours, or
       more frequently according to local procedures.
       9.2.1.4. Provide fresh water at each shift change.
   9.2.2. The US Army provides veterinary service for MWDs as prescribed by support
   agreements and AFJI 48-131/AR 40-905, Veterinary Health Services. Refer to AFJI 48-
   131/AR 40-905 for veterinary support and emergency veterinary care details. AFMAN 31-
   219 has additional information. The veterinarian and kennel master will establish sanitation
   standards and train handlers on first aid. Units must plan for veterinary care when supporting
   TDY commitments.
   9.2.3. Medical records kept by the veterinarian are permanent records. If the veterinarian
   does not have an office, the kennel master may store the records. Copies of all
   correspondence related to euthanasia are kept as part of the medical records. All medical
   records on deceased MWDs are sent to the 341 TRS. Veterinarians will also complete DD
   Form 1743, Death Certificate of Military Dog. The original is sent to the unit supply officer
   as the source document for removing the MWD from the unit property record. The first copy
   is filed in the MWD administrative record. A copy is also filed in the MWD medical records
   and sent to the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer if a replacement MWD is requested.
       9.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Upon death or euthanasia of a MWD, send copies of DD
       Form 1743, Military Dog Death Certificate, and original DD Form 1834, Military
       Working Dog Service Record, to Status Control (341TRS/TTLM), 1239 Knight St,
       Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5631. Forward an information copy of the DD Form 1743 and
       DD Form 1834 to HQ USAFE/A7SOI, MWD Action Officer.
   9.2.4. Handlers will be familiar with the dog's normal body functions, such as appetite,
   stools, and normal attitude, and report changes to the veterinarian immediately.
   9.2.5. The US Army Veterinary Command prescribes the type and brand of ration fed to
   MWDs. Procure food through official supply or GSA channels only unless the attending
   veterinarian approves a different ration.
9.3. (Added-INCIRLIKAB) Emergency Evacuation. In any incident requiring a kennel
evacuation such as fire, major accident or bomb threat, the first person on-scene will sound the
alarm and notify the BDOC immediately. The BDOC will initiate a MWD section recall. If
class 1.1 explosives are on site MWDs will be evacuated outside the 4,000 ft. cordon required
IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards.

                                          Chapter 10

      DETECTOR DOG SUPPORT TO CIVILIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

10.1. General: Executive Orders and public law permit, and in some cases may mandate, the
Department of Defense to provide explosive and narcotic detector dog support to civilian law
enforcement agencies for dignitary protection and drug interdiction. As the DOD Executive
Agency for military working dog program management, Headquarters Air Force Security Forces
Center, through delegated authority from HQ AF/A7S, receives and processes requests for
detector dog support from the United States Secret Service, Department of State, United States
Marshal Service (USMS), United States Customs Service (USCS), Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation and other non-DOD law enforcement
agencies (LEA). This chapter provides guidance on deployment of detector dog teams in support
of these requests. Unless otherwise noted, references in this chapter apply to both Explosive
Detector Dogs (EDD) and Drug Detector Dogs (DDD).
10.2. Detector Dog Operations: Per title 10 U.S.C. § 372, Use of military equipment and
facilities, the Secretary of Defense may make equipment available to any federal, state, or local
LEA for law enforcement purposes. Upon request, an MWD (viewed by DOD as a piece of
equipment) may be loaned to law enforcement officials. If a MWD is loaned to a LEA, its
military handler must be provided to work the MWD as they always work as a team. Depending
upon the type of support, LEAs may submit a request for EDD/DDD support in several ways.
   10.2.1. Direct Routine Requests: For short-term support (less than 30 days), a LEA may
   submit a request directly to the Installation Commander. The Installation Commander may
   approve requests that do not require funding, or for which the LEA will provide
   reimbursement, if the support does not negatively affect the installation’s operational
   requirements for military readiness. If the LEA requests DOD funding, or if the installation
   does not have the capability to provide the requested support, the request will be forwarded
   through that MAJCOM’s MWD Action Officer to HQ AFSFC for resolution. Before
   providing non-emergency detector dog support to local government police, fires, or disaster
   officials, accomplish a Civilian Support Release and Reimbursement Agreement. Coordinate
   the agreement and requests for assistance with the local SJA. See Attachment 2 for a sample
   MWD Civilian Support Release and Reimbursement Agreement.
   10.2.2. Non-direct Routine Requests: EDD teams extensively support the USSS protection
   of the President, Vice President, First Lady and foreign heads-of-state. EDD teams also
   routinely support the DOS protection of the Secretary of State and foreign dignitaries. DDD
   teams support the USCS and DEA in the detection and monitoring of the air, land, and sea
   transit of illegal drugs. HQ AFSFC receives requests for support, validates these requests
   and sources support from the military installation nearest the support area with detector dog
   capability, regardless of Service component. All initial sourcing is done through the Service
   component or MAJCOM MWD Action Officer. Units that would suffer degradation of
   mission readiness through temporary loss of a detector dog will be excused from providing
   support and another unit will be tasked. Fiscal issues are generally not grounds to excuse a
   unit from providing support.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                  45


  10.2.3. Non-routine Requests: Requests for EDD support which do not meet the criteria as
  Non Direct Routine support (for example, National Special Security Events) are submitted to
  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Executive Secretariat (OSD/ES). The requesting
  agency will submit a letter to OSD/ES explaining the reason for support and how they will
  reimburse the tasked unit. Once approved, OSD/ES notifies HQ AFSFC who will in-turn
  contact the responsible Service component or MAJCOM MWD Action Officer for the DOD
  unit closest to the mission support location. Team rotations for extended support will be
  done on a ―fair-share‖ basis.
  10.2.4. When detector dog teams support non-DOD agencies, the following procedures must
  be followed:
     10.2.4.1. The dog and handler must be used together.
     10.2.4.2. The handler must have exclusive control over the detection support effort and
     complete access to the search area. (EDD only).
     10.2.4.3. Handlers perform the sole task of working their dogs and will not take part in
     any other activity intended to support civil authorities unless specifically authorized by
     HQ AFSFC.
     10.2.4.4. Only the team's drug or explosives detection capabilities will be used. Teams
     will not track suspects, seize evidence, search buildings or areas for personnel, or be used
     to pursue, bite and hold, or in any way assist in apprehending, arresting or detaining
     persons.
     10.2.4.5. Teams will not be used to search persons.
     10.2.4.6. A representative of the requesting agency or civil jurisdiction must escort the
     team at all times while working.
     10.2.4.7. If the dog responds positively, the handler will advise the agency representative
     and withdraw or continue other disassociated detection support.
     10.2.4.8. An EDD handler will not disarm or move any actual or suspected explosive
     device.
     10.2.4.9. Advise the requesting agency that the DOD will not accept responsibility for
     damages resulting from the use of detector dog teams. Handlers will not seize or retrieve
     evidence, assist in setting up, or maintaining chain of custody, nor engage in any other
     activities which could be considered as enforcing the law in connection with this support.
     10.2.4.10. The handler may, if necessary, testify in civil court. Testimony will be limited
     to explaining the training received, the past success rates of the dog, the events leading to
     employment in this particular detection support, and the results of that detection support.
     10.2.4.11. MWD teams may assist CLEA in searching for persons when it is considered
     humanitarian in nature, for example, a lost child or elderly person.
  10.2.5. On all detector dog requests, once HQ AFSFC determines a tasked unit has sufficient
  resources to provide support, a tasking message is prepared and transmitted to the responsible
  unit. The message will contain all information required to prepare TDYorders and brief
  handler(s) on requirements and responsibilities. The Commander and/or kennel master will
  ensure the handler(s) are thoroughly briefed on the message and provided a personal copy.
46                              AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011


  Whenever possible, begin pre-departure preparations such as orders, canine physical and
  health certificate etc. immediately upon notification of a tasking. Do not wait for receipt of
  the tasking message as this could create logistics problems since most requests for support
  have a very short response time.
     10.2.5.1. (Added-USAFE) When tasked to support the Secret Service or Department of
     State, the tasked unit will contact the agent in charge with the team’s travel itinerary,
     passport information, and other pertinent data. An international driver’s license is
     recommended when tasked with Secret Service or Department of State support. Complete
     MWD Tasking Database as soon as possible after tasking notification and forward to HQ
     USAFE/A7SOI, MWD Action Officer via e-mail. The database will be used to complete
     TDY orders.
  10.2.6. Immediately upon notification of an MWD support request, the kennel master will
  select a qualified team. The kennel master will immediately notify the selected handler and
  provide the name and phone number of the requesting agency representative to contact. The
  handler will make immediate contact with the representative. If direct contact cannot be
  made, give a commercial 24 hour contact number so the representative can return the
  handler’s call. For USSS support, if voice contact is not made with the representative within
  four hours, the handler will contact the USSS Duty Desk, Washington D.C., (202) 395-4004
  and pass their name, travel information and 24 hour contact number.
  10.2.7. The tasked unit will also ensure the following is done as quickly as possible:
     10.2.7.1. Prepare TDY travel orders as determined by HQ AFSFC. Use of blanket or
     similar type TDY orders is not authorized when traveling in support of the President or
     Vice President of the United States. EDD handlers may be diverted or assigned another
     mission immediately after completing the initial mission. Ensure orders reflect
     ―Variations Authorized‖.
     10.2.7.2. If travel requires crossing any state line or country boundary, arrange for
     immediate veterinary physical and health certificate for the MWD tasked to support the
     mission. The MWD’s health records and current health certificate will accompany the
     handler while away from home station.
     10.2.7.3. Make travel arrangements for the handler and dog. Team will drive to the
     support area if within driving distance. The MAJCOM providing support will coordinate
     with HQ AFSFC as to whether the team should drive or fly.
     10.2.7.4. Contact the requesting agency representative and pass all information
     concerning travel arrangements and arrival time. (Do not use the large metal mobility
     type crate for these type deployments). See Para 2.7 for more guidance on shipping
     MWDs.
     10.2.7.5. A minivan or midsize sport utility vehicle are the standard for use by EDD and
     DDD teams. Use a government vehicle only with the approval of the requesting agency
     representative.
     10.2.7.6. Ensure handlers take sufficient dog food, as well as an extra leash, choke chain,
     and reward food and medication (as applicable), for the duration of the TDY. All teams
     will ensure they have a muzzle available at all times throughout the mission.
AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011                                                 47


  10.2.8. Once at the mission location, detector dog teams will fall under the operational
  control of the supported agency but still responsible for direction issued by HQ AFSFC.
  10.2.8. (USAFE) Notify home-base kennel master upon arrival at TDY location. Provide
  emergency contact information.
     10.2.8.1. The senior MWD handler will act as the military supervisor and assist the
     supported agency supervisor(s) as needed. During the security operation briefing (EDD)
     or mission orientation briefing (DDD), appropriate agencies will distribute identification
     media and equipment. Handlers will ensure OPSEC and security of the equipment at all
     times. Any identification designed at home station for the sole purpose of identifying the
     team as a DOD MWD team will not be used when supporting these missions. Orders
     will reflect the handler is traveling with a federal service animal and official credentials
     will be issued upon arrival at TDY location.
     10.2.8.2. Ensure the presence of a support agency representative or EOD technician at all
     times when the DDD or EDD team is searching. If an EDD responds, the handler will
     terminate the search and stand-by outside the affected area. Handlers will not handle or
     maintain custody of any explosive devices or drugs discovered.
     10.2.8.3. The EDD teams will only search for explosive devices and will not perform
     duties that may conflict with requirements established under the Posse Comitatus Act.
     DDD teams can only search for drug contraband.
  10.2.9. Male EDD handlers will wear conservative dark colored business suits. Female
  EDD handlers will wear conservative business suits with slacks in lieu of skirts. Certain
  missions require casual clothing or coveralls. Casual clothing is defined as dress
  slacks/khakis and long/short sleeve collared shirts. At no time will handlers wear jeans,
  shorts, tennis shoes, shirts with offensive language or logos while performing official duties.
  Military dress and appearance standards will be maintained throughout the duration of the
  TDY. The tasking message will identify clothing requirements. EDD handlers are
  authorized a civilian clothing allowance. Refer to DOD 7000.14R, Vol 7A, Military Pay
  Policy and Procedures Active Duty and Reserve Duty on the publications website.
  10.2.10. Handlers currently assigned and validated with an MWD will have an Official
  Passport and a current Defense Travel System account. Taskings to support OCONUS
  missions are common and rarely have sufficient advance notice to process a passport
  application. Complete and process an official passport application for handlers immediately
  upon their assignment to the unit. Contact local MPF for guidance.
  10.2.11. Weapons of any type, including privately owned, are prohibited while performing
  duties with any non-DOD agency unless directed otherwise by HQ AFSFC.
  10.2.12. The use of Government Sponsored Travel Credit Card (GTCC) is mandatory IAW
  DOD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Vol 9, 030301. Each handler must possess a
  government Sponsored Travel Card, unless exempted as prescribed by DOD FMR Vol 9,
  030302. The DTS system does allow for electronic fund transfer advances to be made to
  travelers who do not possess GTCC’s, but is not always practical due to time restraints.
  10.2.13. If confusion or a disagreement on how to search an area occurs, the senior handler
  will meet with the supported agency representative and attempt to resolve the issue. If a
48                             AFI31-202_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 4 MAY 2011


  resolution cannot be reached, the MWD team will proceed as directed, unless the safety of
  the team would be compromised. Accomplish a detailed after action report of the incident
  and forward it through the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer to HQ AFSFC as soon as
  possible. If a similar conflict arises with a DDD team, the senior handler/supervisor will
  attempt to reach a resolution with the supported agency. If no resolution can be reached,
  contact HQ AFSFC and file an after action report and forward it to the HQ Air Force MWD
  Program Manager.
  10.2.14. Both EDD and DDD handlers will adhere to all safety practices at all times.
     10.2.14.1. Do not leave MWDs unattended in vehicles, except in an emergency. If a rare
     situation arises when you must leave an MWD unattended in a vehicle, ensure the MWD
     remains in view at all times and that adequate ventilation is provided.
     10.2.14.2. MWDs will remain on leash at all times while searching and muzzled to and
