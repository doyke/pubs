SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The publication has been revised. This revision of HAFBI 36-701 includes pre-decisional
involvement, management/Union partnering, coordination requirements, tier numbering
compliancy, and updated organization titles and symbols.
1. Background.
     1.1. The provisions of Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act necessitated changes in our
     relationship and responsibilities in dealing with the local Union. Management officials and

     Local Supplement Agreement (LSA), and are encouraged to use collaborative methods to
     develop solutions to effectively and efficiently accomplish mission requirements (T-0).
2. Policy.
     2.1. All management personnel and supervisors share the responsibility to actively
     participate in a program of full and positive support to improve relations with the labor
     organization at Hill AFB through meaningful collective bargaining and management/labor

     Board, Federal Labor Relations Authority, and all levels of the federal government will be
     followed (T-0).
     2.2. To have the best labor relations program possible, each supervisor and manager must be
     very familiar with all applicable labor agreements (T-2). It must be understood and accepted
     that contractual relationships now exist which define the rights and obligations of both
