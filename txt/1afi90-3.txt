                                            Chapter 1

                                          Introduction


1.1 Purpose of Assessment: HQ CONR-1 AF assessment of alert functions provides the
CFACC with an operational judgment of the readiness and ability of those forces assigned to
accomplish the NORAD mission. Adherence to all applicable plans, orders, directives, and
instructions will be assessed to determine compliance. In an effort to stay consistent with
NORAD Fighter Alert Force Evaluation (FAFE) requirements, AFOA assessments will be
conducted to include but not limited to guidance published in NI 90-3. Sector generated
scenarios designated by the term “SPADE” will be developed and used to assess flying
operations. In certain circumstances, assessments may be conducted in conjunction with real-
world events or pre-scheduled exercises.

1.2 Authority: Assessment authority is derived from direction of the CFACC. Responsibility
for the AFOA program is delegated to the 1 AF/A4 Director. Adherence to guidance published
in this document is mandatory.

1.3 Concept: The readiness of the CONR-1 AF assigned forces will be assessed in conjunction
with appropriate parent command or service inspection guidelines. This will be accomplished on
a regular and recurring basis to promote the preparation process that leads to increased readiness.
The AFOA will normally be a live-fly assessment conducted by a 1 AF AFOA team and
augmented with Major Command (MAJCOM), ANG, or AFRC members as required. The
assessment will be limited to those functions supporting the Fighter Alert Force (FAF). The FAF
is defined as a team comprised of the fighter unit (or alert site detachment) OPCON or TACON
to NORAD, the local/host Command Post (CP)/Combat Operations Center (COC) and Security
Forces supporting the NORAD mission. The AFOA is designed to assess the capabilities of the
FAF to perform their peacetime NORAD mission while complying with NORAD, service, and
unit directives. The AFOA will normally be conducted at CONR alert sites activated during
steady-state readiness conditions. The AFOA may also be conducted at locations that are
OPCON or TACON to NORAD during increased readiness postures or while fulfilling
temporary alert commitments.

1.4 Frequency of Assessment: AFOAs will be conducted 15 months after the last NORAD
FAFE. If a unit received a re-evaluation of a NORAD FAFE, then the AFOA will be conducted
eight months after the NORAD re-evaluation. If major areas of concern are identified during the
AFOA, a follow-on assessment may be accomplished not later than two months following the
current AFOA. The second assessment may be requested by 1 AF A3, A4, A7 or the assessed
unit and may be limited to the identified major areas of concern or can be focused on an entire
AFOA. Unit requested second assessments will be unit funded. The CONR-1AF CFACC will be
the final authority for additional AFOA requests. Newly assigned/identified ASA units will
receive an initial AFOA IAW current CFACC-directed Special Instructions (SPINS).

                                    Concept of Assessment


2.1 Team Composition: The AFOA team will normally consist of seven members responsible
for specific assessment duties. The team will consist of members from the 1AF A3, A4 and A7
directorates or augmentees as required. 1AF/A4 will provide four team members to function as
aircraft maintenance assessors. One person will function as the overall AFOA program manager
and at least one assessor must be trained on aircraft weapons system maintenance. 1AF/A3 will
provide one pilot to function as the team lead/operations assessor and one person to function as
the command post assessor. 1AF/A7 will provide one team member to function as the security
forces assessor. A7 director reserves the right to add an additional member if workload exceeds
the capability of one assessor. A4 will be advised for budget purposes as soon as possible.

2.1.1 An augmentee, if required, will be provided by the respective directorate. Additional team
members may be required to support training of new assessors and will also be the responsibility
of the respective directorate. All augmentees and trainees will be coordinated with the AFOA
program manager for funds availability. Selected augmentees must be fully qualified in alert
operations, alert aircraft maintenance, or alert security force measures.

2.1.2 Observers from ACC, AFRC, ANG, Air Defense Sectors or Alert units may accompany
the AFOA team. Observers will have no assessment responsibility and will not exercise any
authority or provide instruction during the AFOA. Funding for observers will be the
responsibility of their own command, sector, or unit. Each observer will be responsible for their
own travel arrangements. All observers will coordinate with the AFOA program manager and
may be included on the AFOA Entry Authority List (EAL).

                                   Conduct of Assessment


3.1 AFOA Schedule: The program manager will create and maintain a current fiscal year
AFOA schedule. Assessments will be scheduled IAW paragraph 1.4 of this instruction. The
program manager will coordinate the proposed schedule with A3/A7 to eliminate any scheduling
conflict. Assessed units will receive an AFOA approximately 15 months after the last NORAD
FAFE; however, units can be scheduled anytime within the required month. In an effort to
prevent any AFOA and FAFE conflicts, the program manager will forward the schedule to
NORAD IG for review. A4 Director will have final approval of the AFOA schedule. The
program manager will provide an approved current AFOA schedule to A3/A7, sector exercise
offices and all assigned alert Chief Enlisted Managers (CEM).

3.2 Length of Assessment: Assessments will normally be conducted in two days with an
additional day for an out brief.

3.3 Team Arrival Procedures: Upon arrival at TDY location, the AFOA team lead or program
manager may direct a team meeting to ensure team members arrival and discuss any new updates.
CONR-1AF/A3 and A7 assessors will deliver a signed copy of the EAL to the unit no later than 1
hour prior to agreed assessment start time. The EAL validation procedures will be exercised and
evaluated. The remaining AFOA team members will arrive at the unit’s alert location 1 hour
after EAL delivery. After initial access into the alert area, the AFOA team lead will meet with
alert operations personnel to discuss assessment flow and identify any unit LIMFACs and
shortfalls. Team members from A4 will meet with the unit’s CEM and maintenance personnel
for an initial in-brief and daily safety briefings. Command post team members from A3 will
proceed directly to the unit’s command post. The A7 team member will proceed directly to the
security forces section.

3.5 Report Format/Distribution: The AFOA report will contain, as a minimum, assessment
results similar to those reported in the NORAD FAFE report. Therefore, an annual review of the
AFOA report format will be conducted by the program manager and at least one member from
CONR-1AF A3 and A7. Any changes in a directorate’s specific section of the report will be
coordinated and approved by the appropriate director before implementation. Additional
assessment results can be observed and reported in the AFOA report at the discretion of the
appropriate director.

3.5.1 Report assessment observations may identify Strengths, Areas for Improvement or contain
an Overall Summary describing strengths and areas of improvement for each assessed category.
The report may also identify Critical, Critical Safety and Critical Repeat observations. Critical
observations require immediate attention prior to the NORAD FAFE. Critical safety
observations are procedures or practices which, if not correctly followed, could result in
personnel injury, or damage to or destruction of equipment. Critical Repeat observations are
repeats from the last NORAD FAFE or CONR-1 AF AFOA. No other category of observations
terms will be authorized unless approved by the A4 Director.

3.5.2 A draft report will be presented to the unit’s wing leadership at the conclusion of the
assessment. A final report will be provided to the unit no later than three weeks following the
assessment. The A4 Director will be the approving authority of the final report and will send the
report to the unit’s wing leadership. A copy of the final report will be published on the
CONR/A4 website.

3.6 Out Brief Procedures: Two out briefs will be conducted at the conclusion of the AFOA.
The first will be an executive brief provided to the unit’s wing/detachment leadership conducted
by the team lead. The second will be a maintenance brief conducted by the program manager to
the maintenance group leadership.

3.7 Post Deployment Requirements: The program manager will provide a visual briefing for
the A4 Director and staff. The program manager will staff the draft report through each
participating directorate, facilitate recommended changes, and provide a final copy to the A4
Director for approval/distribution. AFOA team members from A3 and A7 will brief their
respective directors accordingly.
