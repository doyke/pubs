                                           Chapter 2

                                 OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

2.1. Mission. The CAA unit is a combat aviation advisory unit specifically organized to assess,
train, advise and assist foreign aviation forces in the employment and sustainment of their own
assets in both peace, war and, when necessary, integrate those assets into joint, multi-national
operations. A principal objective of CAA advisory operations is to facilitate the availability,
reliability, safety, and interoperability of partner nation (PN) or participating nation aviation
resources to support combined Special Operations Forces (SOF).
2.2. Mission Focus and Terms Explained. The focus of all US foreign internal defense (FID)
efforts is to support the PN program of internal defense and development (IDAD). These
national programs are designed to free and protect a nation from subversion, lawlessness, and
insurgency by emphasizing the building of viable institutions that respond to the needs of
society. The most significant manifestation of these needs is likely to be economic, social,
informational, or political; therefore, these needs should prescribe the principal focus of United
States (US) efforts. The US will generally employ a mix of diplomatic, economic, informational,
and military instruments of national power in support of these objectives. Military assistance is
often necessary in order to provide the secure environment for the above efforts to become
effective.
   2.2.1. Assess foreign military aviation capabilities and provide direction or
   recommendations towards improving PN airpower employment and sustainment methods.
   Aviation assessments are carried out primarily in support of geographical combatant
   command (GCC) requirements and for other key agencies and departments of the US
   government. Assessments focus on foreign aviation capabilities and limitations, specifically
   aircrew capability and safety, aircraft airworthiness, critical resource availability, resource
   sustainability, and operational potential.
   2.2.2. Train foreign military forces to operate and sustain indigenous airpower resources and
   capabilities. Training includes tactics, techniques, and procedures in such areas as C2; search
   and rescue (SAR); combat search and rescue (CSAR); communications systems support; air-
   ground interface; aerial insertion, extraction, and resupply; intelligence, surveillance, and
   reconnaissance (ISR); close air support (CAS); and airdrop operations. Training is neither
   time- nor situation-specific. Appropriately funded training can be used to close specific gaps
   in foreign aviation skills and raise the level of competency where they can be advised on the
   proper employment of acquired capabilities. This training can only occur with appropriate
   support and sustainment areas that include; aircraft maintenance, logistics, aircrew flight
   equipment (AFE), medical, air base defense, personal survival, personnel recovery (PR),
   munitions, ground safety, and other functions supporting combat air operations.
   2.2.3. Advise foreign military forces and governmental agencies on how to employ airpower
   in specific operational situations. Advisory assistance may also be provided to GCCs on
   such issues as foreign airpower capabilities, limitations, and potential roles supporting joint
   and combined operations. Advising is conducted within the context of specific times, places,
   and situations. Advisory assistance addresses such areas as airpower doctrine (i.e., how to
   employ airpower as opposed to how to operate airplanes), mission planning, basing concepts,
 8                                                     AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013


     operational sustainment methods, tactical employment, communications capabilities, and C2
     development/employment for real-world operations and contingency actions. Along with
     training, Air Force advisory assistance helps foreign military forces and government agencies
     generate and sustain airpower supporting IDAD programs.
     2.2.4. Assist foreign aviation forces in executing specific missions or contingency
     operations. Assistance can take on many forms, but generally includes hands-on assistance
     in agile combat support capabilities such as aircraft maintenance, fuels, health services
     support, and aviation medicine. Assistance may also include operational capabilities like C2,
     intelligence exploitation, aircrew mission planning, and direct on-board advisory assistance
     in tactical operations. In the tactical realm, assistance can be applied to such functions as
     combat search and rescue (CSAR); tactical mobility, including personnel insertion and
     extraction; casualty evacuation; ISR; and air attack.
     2.2.5. Facilitate force integration for multinational operations. Air Force personnel bring all
     other key tasks (assessing, training, advising, and assisting) together in a coordinated effort to
     draw foreign aviation forces into joint or combined operations.
     2.2.6. Provide direct support to partner countries by using resources to provide intelligence,
     communications capability, logistics support, and airpower effects.
2.3. Scope of Operations. CAAs support the theater combatant commanders in both peace and
war in a wide variety of local and regional conflicts and emergencies. Combat advisory
capabilities are applied throughout the range of military operations. CAA capabilities are
focused on the following interrelated mission areas: FID, unconventional warfare (UW),
counterterrorism (CT), counterinsurgency (COIN), stability operations (Stab Ops), and security
force assistance (SFA). The mission arena also encompasses such collateral activities as
advising on air support for disaster assistance and humanitarian aid. The aviation aspect of FID
(AvFID) is one of training and advising foreign aviation forces in the sustained use of airpower.
     2.3.1. Foreign Internal Defense: FID from the US perspective, refers to the US activities
     that support a host nation’s (HN) IDAD strategy design to protect against subversion,
     lawlessness, insurgency, terrorism, and other threats to their security, stability, and
     legitimacy. Characteristics of FID involve the instruments of national power (diplomatic,
     informational, military, and economic) through which elements of that power (e.g., financial,
     intelligence, and law enforcement) can be applied to support a HN IDAD program. All
     IDAD programs respond to the needs of the host nation’s (HN) society. The objective of
     FID is to assist the HN to develop a program supporting the goals of the HN (JP 3-22,
     Foreign Internal Defense). Operations associated with AvFID include support to PN
     counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, counternarcotics and stability operations programs.
        2.3.1.1. AvFID functions as a complement to other SOF component operations involving
        ground, maritime, and riverine advisory assistance and training conducted with PN forces
        within various theaters of operation.
     2.3.2. Security Force Assistance: DOD’s primary role in security sector reform (SSR) is
     supporting the reform, restructuring, or reestablishment of the armed forces and defense
     sector, which is accomplished through SFA. SFA specifically pertains to those DOD
     activities that contribute to the unified action by the US government to support the
     development of the capacity and capability of foreign security forces (FSF) and their
AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              9


  supporting institutions. FSF include but are not limited to military forces; police forces,
  border police, coast guard, and customs officials; paramilitary forces; interior and
  intelligence services; forces peculiar to specific nations, states, tribes, or ethnic groups;
  prison, correctional, and penal services; and the government ministries or departments
  responsible for the above services. The US military engages in activities to enhance the
  capabilities of a PN (or regional security organization) by providing training, equipment,
  advice, and assistance to those FSF organized under the equivalent of a national ministry of
  defense (or an equivalent regional military or paramilitary force). (JP 3-22).
  2.3.3. Unconventional Warfare: UW are those activities conducted to enable a resistance
  movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power
  by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force in a denied area
  (JP3-05). Tasks include advising and training foreign aviation units to support partisan
  operations in occupied territory. These tasks include, but not limited to, aerial insertion,
  extraction, and resupply from a third country sanctuary, aerial surveillance, C2 platforms,
  communications links, service evasion and escape nets, and ISR collection sites.
  2.3.4. Counterinsurgency: COIN, refers to the comprehensive civilian and military efforts
  taken to defeat insurgency and to address any core grievances (JP3-24). The combat skills,
  experience, cultural awareness, and language skills of SOF allow them to conduct a wide
  array of missions working through or with HN security forces or integrated with US
  conventional forces , which make them particularly suitable for COIN operations or
  campaigns. Unified action is required to successfully conduct COIN operations and includes
  the coordination of all HN, US, and multinational agencies or actors. Civilian agencies lead
  US “whole-of-government” efforts. Achieving unity of effort is challenging in COIN due the
  complex environment with its many actors. The military contribution must be coordinated
  with the HN, partners, and US OGA’s to ensure successful unity of effort. Ideally, all COIN
  efforts protect the population, defeat the insurgents, reinforce the HN legitimacy, and build
  HN capabilities. COIN efforts include, but are not limited to, political, diplomatic,
  economic, health, financial, intelligence, law enforcement, legal, informational, military,
  paramilitary, psychological, and civic actions. As capable insurgents evolve and adapt,
  counterinsurgents must evolve and adapt. (JP 3-24, Counterinsurgency Operations.)
  2.3.5. CAA advisory capabilities in the operations arena include tactical mobility airlift,
  special operations aviation, search and rescue, combat search and rescue, air-ground
  operations, and risk management.
  2.3.6. Assistance in the aviation support arena includes aviation maintenance; supply;
  intelligence and mission planning; munitions; ground safety; AFE; survival; air base defense;
  command, control and communications; and other functions supporting combat air
  operations.
  2.3.7. CAA advisory and training operations are aimed at helping foreign friends and allies
  develop and maintain their own air support capabilities, not to conduct operations for them.
  Operations focus primarily on hands-on, adaptive training and advisory support geared to
  practical applications in partner nations. The term adaptive training refers to instruction in
  applied tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) rather than more basic types of instruction
  provided through such agencies as undergraduate pilot training and the Inter-American Air
  Forces Academy. The adaptive training approach advances basic skills through instruction in
 10                                                  AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013


   the partner language, provided in the partner country using equipment at hand, and applied
   (through advisory assistance) to specific conflicts and tactical situations.
   2.3.8. Assistance to foreign aviation units may be provided through mobile training teams
   (MTT) programmed and funded under security assistance or performed in conjunction with
   other programs conducted by the combatant commands and by various agencies of the US
   government.
   2.3.9. Assistance to the theater combatant commands includes airpower assessments of
   foreign aviation capabilities, primarily in the joint-combined arena. CAAs also perform
   surveys aimed at identifying opportunities and requirements for joint and combined
   operations, exercises, and training.
2.4. The Combat Aviation Advisor’s Environment. The combat aviation advisor deals with a
variety of challenges when working with foreign aviation forces. The most significant
challenges are posed by nonstandard aircraft and PN maintenance practices; dissimilar TTP and
dissimilar aircrew qualification and currency standards. The basic assumptions acquired and
nurtured through years of United States Air Force (USAF) training and experience often do not
apply to foreign flying organizations. The dissimilarities in operating procedures and standards
must be planned for and taken into account when training and advising foreign aviation forces.
These dissimilarities also establish the basis and the need for the guidance contained in this
instruction.
   2.4.1. Some foreign aviation units are fully “mission capable” in a day visual flight rules
   environment, but do not operate at night or in inclement weather. Some units lack basic
   instrument qualification. Other units may possess high-time aircrews with extensive
   instrument experience, but maintain almost no currency or experience in tactical events. In
   many cases, currency and safety standards are closely tied to available funding for
   maintenance, spare parts, and fuel.
   2.4.2. Foreign aviation operating policies and procedures are often based on principles and
   objectives that differ significantly from those of the USAF, contributing even more to the list
   of unknowns the advisor must eventually solve. As an example, instructor aircrew selection,
   crew resource management, and operational procedures are often driven by social, cultural,
   and economic factors rather than by the simple imperative of “what works.” All these
   factors, often coupled with significant language differences, tend to deny both the advisor
   and the PN counterpart a common ground of understanding during the initial stages of an
   advisory relationship.
   2.4.3. There are also legal requirements and constraints placed on advisory personnel that
   pose a special challenge when planning and executing training missions involving foreign
   nationals. As an example, the procedures for selecting and executing unit self-training
   opportunities (i.e., opportunities to train, or train with, foreign aviation forces in furtherance
   of training objectives) are determined, to a great extent, by law as well as by directives and
   instructions internal to AFSOC and the theater commands. The aviation advisor must be
   sufficiently knowledgeable of this guidance to meet the requirements of the law when
   planning and executing aviation training and advisory missions. A principal concern is the
   correct expenditure of public funds. Some training provided to foreign nationals can be
   funded under operations and maintenance. Other forms of training can only be funded under
   security assistance.      There are also specialized forms of training funded under
AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                               11


   counternarcotics or Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercise funds. Note: “Sufficiently
   knowledgeable” means being familiar with the basic guidance covering appropriate training
   opportunities and how to pay for them. It also means knowing when to seek competent legal
   advice.
2.5. Operational Parameters. A major aspect of the CAA mission is to advise foreign aviation
organizations on the employment of airpower. To facilitate the availability, reliability, safety,
and interoperability of foreign aviation forces supporting air or theater campaign objectives,
CAA advisors also fly with foreign aircrews to satisfy specific mission goals. When
accomplishing this mission, the advisor’s flying skills and credibility are absolutely essential.
Accordingly, the advisor must maintain currency and be capable of demonstrating and assessing
flying skills and maneuvers in a variety of missions or events.
   2.5.1. There are two major aspects of the mission requiring advisors to fly with PN
   counterparts.
       2.5.1.1. First, to provide US and allied commanders an accurate notion of foreign
       aircrew reliability, safety, and interoperability, CAA aircrews are required to fly on PN
       aircraft for purposes of assessing their aircrews for competency in specific mission events
       and maneuvers. In other instances, qualified personnel accompany PN aircrews to act as
       safety or mission observers.
       2.5.1.2. Second, after deploying to a theater of operations to advise foreign aviation
       forces, CAA personnel may have to instruct foreign aircrews in specific mission events
       and maneuvers. This training may be required to fill specific gaps in overall PN
       capabilities and to bring their forces up to the level of familiarization and competency
       where they can be advised.
   2.5.2. Under wartime or contingency conditions, mission emphasis will shift from training to
   advising, although training may be appropriate in certain instances when specific capabilities
   are needed to support US, combined, or PN campaign objectives. The need for a candidate
   mission or event will be validated by appropriate US authority prior to executing the training;
   i.e., the Joint Force Commander, Joint Force Air Component Commander, Joint Task Force
   Commander, or Joint Special Operations Task Force Commander.
   2.5.3. In wartime or contingency situations, with appropriate authorization, CAA aircrews
   may fly with PN aircrews in PN aircraft in order to provide the needed margin of safety and
   interoperability for joint-combined operations. The maintenance effort will also shift from
   training to advising, including hands-on assistance.
   2.5.4. When performing unit self-training under normal peacetime conditions, missions or
   events will be selected using the CAA mission essential task list (METL). Further, such
   missions or events will be validated by the appropriate US Military Group (USMILGP),
   country team, or theater command authorities prior to the training being performed.
   2.5.5. Advisory operations and training will be carried out using established TTP. Advisory
   personnel will refer to applicable joint/USAF/major command (MAJCOM) tactics manuals
   for guidance on TTP to be employed when assessing, training, and advising foreign aviation
   forces. New or specially tailored tactics required for specific and specialized PN situations
   or missions will be coordinated through AFSOAWC before they are tested and/or introduced
   in-country.

  2.5.6. CAA training of foreign aviation personnel in missions or tactical events not standard
  to USAF operations will require AFSOAWC/CC approval (or as delegated).
AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                               13

       FLYING OPERATIONS WITH FOREIGN AVIATION ORGANIZATIONS

3.1. Objective. When operating in the joint-combined arena, a major objective of CAA
advisory forces is to facilitate the availability, reliability, safety, and interoperability of PN
aviation resources supporting PN ground special operations and conventional forces. This task
requires an understanding of the PN aviation capabilities and limitations, as well as an advisory
and liaison effort. It may also involve adaptive training to bring the PN aviation unit up to the
point where it can be advised. (See Paragraph 2.3.6).
3.2. Airworthiness and Safety Assessment. When working with PN aviation units for the first
time or when deemed appropriate by the mission commander (MC), all training and advisory
efforts involving flying will be preceded by an assessment of the airworthiness and safety of the
PN unit’s aircraft and crews. The assessment is required for familiarization with PN aviation
capabilities and procedures prior to commencement of combined operations. It is also required
as a basis for conducting risk analysis and risk management procedures, and for estimating
possible levels of combined interoperability.
   3.2.1. Airworthiness and safety assessments will be carried out IAW AFSOAWC operating
   instructions. Airworthiness assessments are performed solely to support CAA flight
   operations, and are provided to the theater special operations command (TSOC) for
   situational awareness only.
   3.2.2. When PN aviation forces will be operating with US forces and/or surface-force
   counterparts during joint-combined operations, the assessment MC should be prepared to
   furnish the results of this assessment to the supported US service component commander,
   designated representative, or higher headquarters before US troops fly onboard PN aircraft.
   3.2.3. Insofar as the team has access to the required information, the assessment will include
   a review of the maintenance status and condition of assigned PN aircraft. It will also include
   a review of the PN aviation unit’s maintenance procedures and practices, including safety.
   The maintenance airworthiness assessment of the PN aircraft will be accomplished prior to
   the flying portion of the assessment.
   3.2.4. The assessment will include a review of the PN unit’s individual aircrew qualification
   and currency status, as well as the unit’s flying training and standardization/evaluation
   programs.
   3.2.5. An assessment of PN aviation capabilities and limitations and a risk assessment
   incorporating the assessment findings will be accomplished before CAA personnel fly as
   instructors, crew members, or airborne observers onboard aircraft belonging to PN aviation
   organizations.
   3.2.6. If the ground phase of the assessment reveals practices, training, or procedures which
   would compromise flight safety and cannot be easily remedied, the assessment will conclude
   and CAA personnel will not board PN aircraft until unsafe conditions are corrected.
   3.2.7. If the flying phase of the assessment reveals practices, training, or procedures which
   compromise flight safety and cannot be easily remedied, CAA personnel will immediately
 14                                                   AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013


   cease flying operations and will no longer board PN aircraft until unsafe conditions are
   corrected.
   3.2.8. The MC will make a go/no-go decision based on the results of the airworthiness and
   safety assessment. If the assessment results indicate minor airworthiness discrepancies that
   may be either corrected on-the-spot or (in the judgment of the MC and maintenance team
   lead) do not affect safety of flight, flight operations may continue.
   3.2.9. If the assessment results indicate minor deficiencies in aircrew tactics, training,
   techniques, or capabilities, the MC may elect to continue flight operations with PN aircrews
   if applying corrective training would bring PN aircrews to appropriate standards. Corrective
   training may be administered by CAAs or other qualified personnel.
   3.2.10. An airworthiness and safety assessment is not required for CAA personnel to fly on
   PN aircraft as passengers on administrative airlift missions. Administrative airlift constitutes
   required movement of troops or equipment associated with the exercise, site/facility surveys,
   or local area orientation.
       3.2.10.1. Prior to, and during deployment, the MC will research appropriate sources of
       information to establish a basis for accepting or declining administrative flights in
       countries where CAA aviation assessments have not been accomplished and
       administrative airlift of advisory forces is anticipated. Evaluations, assessments, or
       recommendations of PN aviation capabilities by other US agencies (i.e., US Embassy,
       USMILGP, Defense Attaché Office, etc.) are among acceptable sources of information.
       3.2.10.2. During the preplanning phase of the operation, if there is no basis for
       determining the safety of PN administrative airlift, the squadron commander (Sq/CC) or
       operations officer will direct an alternate mode of transportation or instruct the MC to
       evaluate the risks and make an on-the-scene call regarding advisory personnel flying PN
       administrative airlift.
3.3. Reassessments. Assessments are valid for 24 months. Teams should update assessments
after every engagement to the extent practical. A reassessment may be required earlier if
personnel and equipment have changed significantly or at the discretion of the MC.
3.4. General. Approval authority for CAA personnel to fly on board PN aircraft is the
AFSOAWC/CC or as delegated. Approval is implied upon successful pre-deployment briefing.
Following satisfactory accomplishment of an airworthiness and safety assessment and approval
to fly on PN aircraft, CAA personnel and augmentees will adhere to the following guidance
governing flying operations with PN aviation forces. (T-3).
3.5. Flying Training. CAA aircrew members will accomplish flying training IAW

paragraphs who are not qualified and current in the PN aircraft may accomplish airborne training
and advisory duties with group commander or equivalent approval. The aircrew members will
be mission current and qualified/certified in the mission aircraft. CAA non-pilot aircrew
members performing such duties will receive familiarization training, to include emergency
egress, in the PN aircraft. (T-2).
   3.8.1. If dissimilar systems or equipment are involved, the individual should receive
   qualification/certification training (i.e., formal course or PN training) in the new system or

   primary aircrew member on all training missions when non-pilot CAAs are onboard. (T-3).
   3.9.5. When augmentee MEP are flying on PN aircraft for the purpose of performing any
   type operation, a CAA pilot will be onboard as a primary aircrew member (access to a set of
   controls). (T-3).
3.10. Airborne Observers. Airborne observers, if required, will be designated by the (Sq/CC)
or operations officer prior to deployment. The MC may employ these designated individuals as
required while deployed. All airborne observers will advise the PN pilot or MC to terminate a
given mission/event or change the mode of operation if it appears that unsafe conditions are
present or that further actions would lead to endangerment of personnel and/or equipment. Prior
to each sortie, all airborne observers will receive appropriate briefings on emergency procedures,
emergency egress, and emergency equipment usage. An initial airworthiness and safety
assessment will be accomplished prior to placing airborne observers on board PN aircraft.
   3.10.1. Advisory Observers. The advisory observer’s principal function is to advise only in
   the application and execution of briefed tactical mission events (and deviations from these
   events) while in the airborne execution phase. Advisory observer duties do not include
   advising on aircraft maneuverability, instruction, or training. Only briefed events, their
   tactical applications, and the execution of these events will be discussed during advisory
   observer operations.
   3.10.2. Advisory observers will be current and qualified (basic and mission) in the
   appropriate tactical event. Advisory observers are not required to be qualified in the aircraft
   in which they are advising. (T-3).
   3.10.3. Advisory observers do not normally occupy primary aircrew positions unless
   necessary to demonstrate the tactical event being discussed.
   3.10.4. Mission Observers. Mission observer duties include monitoring and assessing the
   overall conduct of an operation/mission, or other duties, such as airborne photographer, etc.
   Mission observer duties may include training or advising in TTP or in the use or operation of
   the aircraft while airborne.
   3.10.5. Airborne mission observers are not required to be qualified in any aircraft. CAA
   aircrew members performing mission-related duties may fly as mission observers on PN
   aircraft.
   3.10.6. Mission observers will not occupy primary aircrew positions.

3.11. Assuming Aircraft Commander/Pilot-in-Command (AC/PIC) Status. A PN pilot will
assume responsibility as AC/PIC. CAA pilots will not fly as AC/PIC on foreign-owned aircraft
unless specifically authorized.
   3.11.1. Pilots may fly as AC/PIC on foreign-owned aircraft when specifically authorized by
   the PN and mission guidance. (Consult the Defense Institute of Security Assistance
   Management[DISAM], the Air Force Security Assistance Center [AFSAC], or Secretary of
   the Air Force/International Affairs for clarification on guidance for assuming AC/PIC
   duties.)
3.12. Flight Instructor Duties and Responsibilities (Pilot). Qualified CAA instructor pilots
may train PN personnel in appropriate aircrew skills provided training is aimed at improving
mission/event capabilities of foreign pilots who already possess basic skills. With the exception
of security assistance-funded MTTs, CAA training and advisory assistance is not designed to
provide checkouts in a new weapon system or build basic aviation skills in PN air force units.
When flying with foreign aviation forces, CAA pilots will adhere to the following guidance. (T-
2).
   3.12.1. Non-Security Assistance Training. When operating outside the security assistance
   arena in PN aircraft (for example, joint, combined exchange training events [JCET], JCS
   exercises, etc.), pilots may perform flight instructor duties, but will not assume AC/PIC
   status. The following basic rules apply:
       3.12.1.1. Rule 1. Pilots will not provide flight instruction to PN students who are not
       qualified in the subject aircraft.
       3.12.1.2. Rule 2. Pilots assume the status of advisors, since they cannot assume
       command of PN aircraft. “Training” in this respect will be aimed at preparing PN pilots
       to pursue instructor certification for specific missions/events within their own service or
       organization. This approach is in line with the “train-the-trainer” concept. This training
       may be limited to familiarizing PN aircraft commanders with certain missions/events,
       giving them a foundation they can build on to develop and perfect training programs
       within their own organizations.
       3.12.1.3. Rule 3. The PN pilot being upgraded will act as AC/PIC.
       3.12.1.4. Rule 4. CAA pilots will not “certify” PN personnel in a particular aircraft,
       event, maneuver, etc., or issue documents certifying that PN personnel are qualified in
       such areas. “Graduation” documents will be limited to “certificates of completion” or
       “certificates of attendance”.
       3.12.1.5. Rule 5. Pilots performing advisory and training duties will do so IAW
       guidance contained in this instruction.
   3.12.2. Security Assistance Training. When operating under security assistance funding,
   pilots will perform instructor duties as specified in applicable security assistance directives,
   mission guidance, etc. Pilots performing instructor duties will be fully qualified instructors
   in the subject aircraft and mission/events.
3.13. Flight     Instructor    Duties    and     Responsibilities   (Non-Pilot      Aircrew
Members). Qualified CAA non-pilot aircrew instructors may train PN personnel in appropriate
aircrew skills provided training is aimed at improving mission/event capabilities of foreign
AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 19


aircrew members who already possess basic skills in a given aircraft or crew position. CAA
training and advisory assistance is not designed to provide checkouts in a new weapon system or
build basic aviation skills in PN air force units. When flying with foreign aviation forces, CAA
non-pilot aircrew members will adhere to the following guidance. (T-2).
   3.13.1. Non-Security Assistance Training. When operating outside the security assistance
   arena in PN aircraft, non-pilot aircrew members may perform instructor duties. The
   following basic rules apply:
       3.13.1.1. Rule 1. Non-pilot aircrew instructors will not provide flight instruction to PN
       students who are not qualified in their crew position in the subject aircraft.
       3.13.1.2. Rule 2. Non-pilot aircrew instructors assume the status of advisors.
       “Training”, in this respect, will be aimed at preparing PN aircrew personnel to pursue
       mission/instructor certification for specific missions/events within their own service or
       organization. This approach is in line with the “train-the-trainer” concept. This training
       may be limited to familiarizing PN aircrew personnel with certain missions/events, giving
       them a foundation they can build on to develop and perfect training programs within their
       own organizations.
       3.13.1.3. Rule 3. Non-pilot aircrew instructors will not “certify” foreign personnel in a
       particular aircraft, event, maneuver, etc., or issue documents certifying that foreign
       personnel are qualified in such areas. “Graduation” documents will be limited to
       “certificates of completion” or “certificates of attendance”.
       3.13.1.4. Rule 4. Non-pilot aircrew instructors performing advisory and training duties
       will do so IAW guidance contained in this instruction.
   3.13.2. Security Assistance Training. When operating under security assistance funding,
   non-pilot aircrew members will perform instructor duties as specified in applicable security
   assistance directives, mission guidance, etc. Non-pilot aircrew members performing
   instructor duties will be fully qualified instructors in the subject aircraft and mission/events.
   (T-3).
3.14. When PN personnel fly aboard US aircraft, reference AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, for restrictions, and AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and
Technology Transfer Program, for foreign disclosure.

paragraph may be waived by the AFSOAW/CC.
   4.7.1. Air Base Defense. FP CAAs may train, advise and assist partner nation units
   designated to perform security for military resources and personnel. FP CAAs will tailor the
   ground combat skills plan of instruction (POI) to best accommodate the safety and security of
   operational aviation detachment (OAD) advisory operations in addition to facilitating the
   needs of the partner nation security forces.
4.8. Small Arms Training. When PN small arms ranges do not meet US standards, Security
Forces CAAs will brief the MC on risk mitigation actions required. The MC will determine if
small arms training should be conducted. Team members may assist Security Forces CAAs in
order to provide sufficient control over range operations. Prior to commencing training with PN
forces, the team will be briefed and trained on their range duties and responsibilities.
Overcoming language barriers will be included in the small arms training plan. The designated
medic or pararescue specialist should be present with a medical trauma kit. If not available then
PN will be present to provide medical support.
4.9. Communications. A tactical communication CAA will be designated to establish and
maintain communications for the team. In austere conditions, that individual will be the
communications specialist to setup and maintain field equipment.
4.10. Flight Following. The MC will establish flight following for all flights with advisors on
board. The team may use PN equipment and procedures. They will augment with team
equipment and procedures when necessary. Aircrew will carry an alternate source of

5.4. Mission Commander. The Sq/CC or operations officer will appoint a MC or team leader
for all deployments involving training and/or advisory assistance to foreign aviation forces. For
deployments with less than 13 personnel and no flying operations, the deployed team leader may
function as both the MC and team leader. The MC should focus on supervision and leadership
AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                               25


while deployed. Accordingly, the MC should not perform airborne training or advisory duties
while deployed. MCs will be mission qualified IAW Volume 1 of this instruction; the
AFSOAWC/CC, or delegated authority, is the waiver authority.
   5.4.1. Even though a MC may be designated, the team leader will exercise immediate
   supervision and oversight of the training and advisory effort. When geographically separated
   locations are involved, a team leader will be designated to lead and supervise the personnel at
   each location. In this case, the MC will supervise each team leader. Additional MC duties
   include:
       5.4.1.1. In command of all deployed detachment personnel.
       5.4.1.2. Vested with the authority necessary to manage their detachment and safely
       accomplish the mission.
       5.4.1.3. The final mission authority for accepting a waiver affecting their detachment or
       mission, and will make decisions not specifically assigned to a higher authority.
       5.4.1.4. Charged with keeping the applicable commander informed of mission progress,
       difficulties and personnel/logistics movements.
       5.4.1.5. Responsible for detailed mission planning prior to deployment and while
       deployed.
       5.4.1.6. Responsible for briefing the detachment on local conditions and operating
       procedures.
       5.4.1.7. Responsible for coordinating with the PN, the Embassy, C2 elements, and other
       agencies that may have an impact on the mission.
       5.4.1.8. Charged with ensuring appropriate FP measures are in place and updated
       according to the threat.
       5.4.1.9. Responsible for the welfare of their detachment and ensuring personnel have
       adequate billeting, rations, transportation, and logistics support.
5.5. Team Lead/Noncommissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC). A team lead is normally
designated for multi-element, multi-event operations and/or where mission complexity dictates.
The team lead is primarily responsible for assessing, training, advising, and assisting within the
team specialties.
5.6. Team Sergeant (TS). A dedicated TS will be designated when a full OAD-A is deployed
for training, exercise, or other operations. The TS should not be a primary trainer, but may
conduct limited training activities within their schedule. Their primary duties are to assist the
MC in executing his responsibilities listed above. A dedicated TS should be designated for
smaller teams when the mission requires extensive coordination with other entities or it aids
command and control (split ops). When a smaller team deploys and the mission does not require
a dedicated TS, the team NCOIC will be designated the TS and will execute the TS duties. The
TS will be mission qualified IAW AFSOCI 16-101 Vol 1 of this instruction.
5.7. Recovery Team (RT). The MC should designate personnel to act as the recovery force for
any mission. The MC must bear in mind that recovery operations must be coordinated with US
Embassy and PN assets. The intent is NOT to conduct unilateral combat search and rescue in a
sovereign nation. The intent is to provide additional training for those people who might be best

positioned to aid in the event of an accident or emergency. OAD RT will only be used in low-
threat environments. Designated personnel will receive recovery training IAW AFSOAWC OIs.
5.8. Augmentees. Personnel that are critical to CAA training and advisory operations will meet
the training requirements for augmentees IAW AFSOCI 16-101 Vol 1 of this instruction.
Augmentees not mission qualified must be supervised by an individual who is mission qualified.
   5.8.1. Augmentees are designated personnel, generally from AFSOC sources outside the
   unit, that will be employed when their skills are not resident in the squadron and their
   participation is required to fulfill the unit’s contingency or wartime commitments (for
   example, flight surgeons, independent duty medical technicians [IDMT], physician assistants
   [PA], and Office of Special Investigations, certain aircraft maintenance specialists, etc.).
   These designated augmentees are normally identified in advance, provided mission-specific
   training, and listed against specific mobility positions.
   5.8.2. Augmentees are also employed when their capabilities are not available or resident
   within the unit and their participation is required to facilitate unit self-training during JCS
   exercises, JCET, counternarcotics (CN)-funded missions, etc. Augmentation of this type will
   not be undertaken during JCS exercises and JCETs if it does not clearly support, or result in,
   the CAA training to METLs.

                PRE-DEPLOYMENT PLANNING AND REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Planning. The AFSOAWC/A5 office maintains the operation instruction on the planning
process. It includes the appropriate timelines and forms required.
6.2. Briefings. Provide summaries and briefings for all travel and deployments. Conferences
and site surveys require, at a minimum, 5Ws information for the AFSOAWC/CC or designated
authority. Deployments for exercises and operations require briefings to the squadron and
AFSOAWC/CC or delegated authority. AFSOAWC/CC or designated authorit written approval
is required for aircrew flying on non USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401. (T-3).
6.3. Murder Board. The murder board is a unit level event. At this event, the unit commander
or designated representative will approve planned operations and provide other guidance as
required. The operations order/concept of operations (OPORD/CONOPS) will be briefed and
the team will answer questions and clarify information pertaining to the plan. The MC will
provide a read ahead to the squadron commander and operations officer. All available squadron
personnel will attend. Murder boards should be held far enough in advance of deployments that
identified problems and discrepancies can be corrected before deployment. (T-4).
6.4. Formal Lesson Plans. Formal lesson plans/POIs are prepared as required and submitted to
the MC/team leader. If required, formal lesson plans can be submitted to the language lab for
conversion to target language 45 days in advance.
6.5. Foreign Disclosure. CAA will not provide official government documents, instructions,
and manuals to the PN without proper foreign disclosure approval. The Embassy/USMILGP
will be included in the coordination process. Do not release proprietary information without
authorizations from the owner. When in doubt, contact the document owner/OPR or seek legal
assistance.
6.6. Spin-Up/Isolation Training. Conduct spin-up/isolation training for all deployments to
refresh team members on small unit tactics, FP, deployed cultural environment, language, and
flying currency. Spin-up/isolation training should be in addition to required ground training and
tailored specifically for the deployment. Spin-up/isolation training is also a time for team
building. Attendance is mandatory for all team members, to include augmentees, and as a
minimum spin-up/isolation training will include the following events.
   6.6.1. Aircrew Training. Aircrew will deploy qualified/certified and current in the intended
   training aircraft. Qualification/certification will last through the end of the deployment.
   Spin-up for aircrew will include training to the required qualification/certification on
   applicable aircraft IAW AFSOCI 11-219, Vol 1, or AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1. Aircrew
   qualification/certification training should not conflict with team isolation training. (T-3).
       6.6.1.1. Prior to any flying deployment, the MC/TS will ensure that a "required for the
       mission" letter is completed with the unit ARMS office at least two weeks prior to
       mission execution.
   6.6.2. Force Protection. FP CAAs assigned to an OAD A/B will ensure all team personnel
   have the most current threat conditions, equipment and FP TTP to safely and securely
   conduct combat advisory operations abroad. The MC will assess the FP situation and his
28                                                AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013


  ability to mitigate risks if the threat level changes. At least one member of the team will be
  FP Level 2 trained where the terrorist or criminal threat is moderate or greater. Any location
  with a threat level potential of high will require a Security Forces advisor on the team.
  Surveys and FP plans from the Embassy regional security office (RSO) or another SOF team
  at the deployed location may be used in lieu of the team making its own assessment. In all
  cases, the team will coordinate their FP plan and posture with the RSO and other deployed
  SOF elements. It will be included in the OPORD and a copy left at the unit.
  6.6.3. Weapons.     Team members should accomplish weapons training and tactics
  appropriate for anticipated deployed threat level. Team members should also rehearse
  weapons training specific to the POI. It is USSOCOM policy for SOF to deploy with
  weapons. Coordinate with the TSOC or Embassy for a compatible policy for storing and
  carrying weapons. Some countries will not authorize personnel to enter with weapons. If
  that is the case, coordinate for an exception to policy waiver at least 45 days prior to
  deploying. IAW USSOCOM Directive 525-4, Annex F, the waiver authority is AFSOC/CC.
  The MC must plan for the contingency where the team has to redeploy for a crisis and be met
  by their weapons.
  6.6.4. Pre-Deployment Language, Regional Expertise, & Culture (LREC) Training. All
  deploying SOF and SOF enablers shall receive pre-deployment language and culture training
  for the area in which they are deploying. This training shall consist of at least 40 contact
  hours of instruction. The waiver authority for this requirement is Commander, USSOCOM
  (CDRUSSOCOM), or as delegated.
     6.6.4.1. Institutional LREC Training and Education. MCs, TS, with the assistance of the
     command language program manager (CLPM) will ensure deploying tactical elements
     have sufficient, relevant language capability at 2/2/2 and 3/3/3 and sufficient global
     capability in other specified languages.
  6.6.5. Personnel Recovery. Develop a PR plan for all deployments. All necessary RT
  training will take place prior to deployment. The team will rehearse likely PR scenarios.
  Coordinate it with theater joint personnel recovery center or personnel recovery coordination
  cell and other deployed SOF elements and submit IAW theater guidance. It will be included
  in the OPORD and a copy left at the unit. An evasive plan of action for planning conferences
  or areas of low threat are not required, but may be accomplished if deemed necessary by the
  MC/team leader.
  6.6.6. Communications. The team will train on all appropriate communications equipment
  prior to deployment. The team will maintain communications connectivity with appropriate
  C2 elements to the maximum extent possible through all phases of the deployment. Plan for
  and carry at least one form of communications equipment during the deployment and
  redeployment. While deployed, team members will have at minimum a primary and
  alternate means of communication. The team will maintain at minimum primary and
  alternate communications with C2 elements. The team will have a secure means of
  communication available (within Embassy policy). If it will require more than an hour to
  come up on secure communications, advise C2 elements.
  6.6.7. Medical. The team will have a medical specialist available to them for general health
  and welfare. Such assistance may be coordinated through the Embassy or other US forces
  deployed to the same location. Indigenous medical services may be used with Sq/CC
AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              29


   approval. Otherwise, the team will deploy with at least an IDMT. When aircrews go into a
   duties not involving flying status, a USAF IDMT, PA or FS is required to bring them back on
   flight status. If flying operations are being conducted it is recommended that an IDMT, PA,
   or FS be part of the OAD package.
6.7. Uniforms and Clothing. Wear clothes appropriate for the local culture, FP posture, and
event. A proper military uniform should be worn when meeting or working with PN forces. If
required, change clothes at the military base. The MC may adjust the uniform policy based on
theater and Embassy guidance. When civilian attire is worn on duty, the standard is business
casual—slacks and a non-descript collared shirt. Business casual attire or a uniform will be worn
when visiting the Embassy. Wear a coat and tie when meeting the Ambassador or PN general
officers in civilian clothes. Flight clothing on organic aircraft will be IAW 11-2MDS, Vol 3 or
TSOC guidance.
6.8. Shipping/Travel. Coordinate with the appropriate mobility office for military air transport
of team equipment when practical. The MC will ensure all customs requirements are met for
personnel and equipment traveling outside of the continental US.
6.9. Funding Limitations. The MC is responsible for spending deployment funds
appropriately. The MC must understand the type of funding approved for the deployment and its
limitations. The OPORD/CONOPS will outline the planned budget and the Sq/CC will be
briefed specifically on funding planned for foreign force training and the purchase of equipment
for the express use of the PN. For any purchases outside that plan, the MC will seek appropriate
chain of command approval before conducting training or purchasing equipment/parts for the
PN.
   6.9.1. Title 10, United States Code (USC). The CAA METL requires advisors to train and
   advise foreign forces. Under the SOF exception to Title 10, CAAs are authorized to use Title
   10, USC funds on a JCET to train unit personnel to train foreign forces (often referred to as
   train-the-trainer). (Refer to current USSOCOM policy on the limitations of training foreign
   forces on JCETs contained in USSOCOM Directive 350-3, Joint Combined Exchange
   Training.) Generally, CAA may not train PN forces in a new capability, nor can JCET funds
   be used to purchase equipment. Authorized expenses can include payment of “incremental
   expenses”, with respect to a developing country, that can include items such as fuel, training
   ammunition, rations, and other expendable training items. PN pay, allowances, and other
   normal costs for the PN are specifically NOT included in incremental costs.
   6.9.2. Title 22, USC. MTTs under Title 22, USC, security assistance funds are specifically
   authorized to train and advise foreign forces. That includes building new capability and
   purchasing equipment and parts. Security assistance is governed primarily by the Foreign
   Assistance Act and is controlled by the Department of State.
   6.9.3. Other Funds. Counter-Narcoterrorism (CNT) funds and other authorities under Title
   10, USC exist to provide military assistance. Commanders at all levels should familiarize
   themselves with the applicability and legal statutes associated with each type of funding. .
6.10. In-Briefs. Prepare PN in-briefs prior to departure. Normally the Embassy/USMILGP will
be briefed also. The brief will include at a minimum operation/exercise objectives, a schedule,
and any activities planned with a high physical or political risk.

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

7.1. Chain of Command. Chain of command and reporting authorities and responsibilities can
be confusing and rapidly change depending on the mission and situation. Knowing who you are
responsible to and who you are responsible for is important and must be clearly understood. The
level of approval for mission changes and tasking will be driven by your C2 structure and
authorities. Changes to the OPORD once it is approved must be communicated and approved by
the proper authorities; fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs) also apply to this process. For detailed
information on SOF C2, please refer to JP 3-05 and Air Force Doctrine Annex, 3-05, Special
Operations.
7.2. Designation of a Commander, Air Force Special Operations Air Component
(COMAFSOAC). The CDRUSSOCOM, Commander, TSOC may designate a COMAFSOAC.
This should be done in writing, and the designation letter will include the individual by name,
and the geographic area of authority. In the absence of a designated COMAFSOAC, the
AFSOAWC/CC may grant waiver authority to an individual in writing. Update the designation
letter to reflect personnel changes due to prolonged deployments.
7.3. Mission Monitoring/Reporting. It is the commander’s intent to know where his people
are and what they are doing while executing missions. Keep commanders at all levels informed
through the following
   7.3.1. Normal Reports. Provide reports per theater C2 requirements. At a minimum, MCs
   will provide an entry report, daily situation reports, and an exit report. In addition to theater
   requirements, copy reports to the appropriate AFSOC chain of command. (If reports are sent
   via phone or fax, use the theater C2 element to e-mail home station with the information.)
   7.3.2. Incident Reports. Provide incident reports IAW theater specific reporting instructions,
   mission design series instructions for aircraft incidents, and applicable unit safety OI. For
   support operations, use applicable instructions for the activity being conducted. Where other
   guidance does not apply, use the AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. Examples of
   reportable events include injury, loss of critical equipment, security incidents, hostile fire,
   detainment, etc.
7.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by
the agency with OPCON or the MC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start
or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the MC.
AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 31

will normally be briefed also. Provide information on the accomplishment of mission objectives
and any pertinent information requiring action before the mission report/after action report
(AAR)/assessment is submitted.
8.2. Mission Report/After Action Reports. At the completion of JCETs, JCS exercises,
MTTs, assessments, CN-funded deployments, etc., CAA team leaders/MCs will prepare mission
reports, AAR, or trip reports, as appropriate, for coordination and dissemination within the
squadron. The reports may be forwarded to higher headquarters for informational purposes,

Terms
Advising—Advisory assistance (advising), as applied to the AvFID mission, is provided to
foreign aviation units, US combatant commands, and other US agencies, and is conducted within
the context of specific times, places, and situations. It includes such product subsets as the
development and use of airpower doctrine; i.e., how to employ airpower (as opposed to how to
operate airplanes), force planning, operational sustainment methods, basing concepts, tactical
employment, and command, control, communication, computer, and intelligence (C4I)
development for specific times, places, and situations.
Augmentee—Personnel, generally drawn from AFSOC sources, employed when their skills are
not resident in the OAD and their participation is required to fulfill the advisory contingent or
wartime commitments.
Aviation Foreign Internal Defense (AvFID)—FID is defined in Joint Pub 1-02, DoD
Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, as “participation by civilian and military agencies
of a government in any of the action programs taken by another government to free and protect
their societies from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency.” It is a joint, interagency activity
involving the total political, economic, informational, and military assistance the United States
provides to help host governments deal with internal threats and crises. Within the context of
AFSOC Instruction 16-101 Volume 3, AvFID focuses on advisory assistance and training aimed
at helping partner nations develop or improve their ability to employ and sustain aviation
resources. Mission-specific subjects include air doctrine, operational planning, command and
control, tactics, airbase defense, air-ground operations, and combat search and rescue.
Coalition Support—Actions taken to facilitate the cooperation, coordination, and integration of
US and foreign military forces during combined operations supporting mutual campaign
objectives. Includes liaison functions, as well as training and advising coalition partners on
tactics, techniques, and procedures, promoting combat effectiveness, safety, and interoperability.
Foreign Internal Defense (FID)—Participation by civilian and military agencies of a
government in any of the action programs taken by another government to free and protect its
society from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency.
Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET)—Training accomplishing joint and combined
training in specific special operations-related mission-essential tasks, increasing interoperability
between US and PN military and paramilitary organizations, and enhancing bilateral
relationships. See Volume 1 of this instruction for minimum training standards.
Mission Essential Task List (METL)—List of tasks considered essential to accomplishment of
a unit’s mission. The METL establishes the specific focus of unit training; i.e., the unit trains to
the METL to prepare for execution of its mission.
Mobile Training Team (MTT)—A team consisting of one or more US personnel drawn from
Service resources and sent on temporary duty to a foreign nation to give instruction. The
mission of the team is to provide, by training instructor personnel, a military service of the
foreign nation with a self-training capability in a particular skill.
Nonstandard Aircraft—For the purposes of this instruction, “nonstandard aircraft” refers to
aircraft not currently in the United States Air Force inventory.
 44                                                  AFSOCI16-101V3 18 SEPTEMBER 2013


Organic Aircraft—Aircraft assigned to and forming an essential part of an organization.
Organic parts of a unit are those listed in its table of organization for the Air Force.
Partner Nation (PN)—A nation which receives the forces and/or supplies of allied nations
and/or NATO organizations to be located on, or to operate in, or to transit through its territory.
For the purposes of this instruction, a nation with which the US performs training and advisory
duties.
Primary Aircrew Position (pilots)—For CAA pilots accomplishing foreign training and
advisory operations, a primary aircrew position entails access to a set of controls necessary to the
safe and efficient operation of the aircraft. Having access to a second set of controls in an
aircraft designated as a “single pilot” aircraft does not necessarily mean the pilot is occupying a
primary aircrew position.
Primary Aircrew Position (non-pilot aircrew members)—For CAA non-pilot aircrew
members accomplishing foreign training and advisory operations, occupying a primary aircrew
position entails functioning as a member of the aircrew whose presence is required for operation
of the aircraft.
Security Assistance—Groups of programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as
amended, and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended, or other related statutes by
which the United States provides defense articles, military training, and other defense-related
services, by grant, loan, credit, or cash sales in furtherance of national policies and objectives.
Training—As applied specifically to the combat advisory and training mission, training enables
foreign aviation units to accomplish (or employ) a variety of missions, technical functions, and
skills. Training covers a variety of product subsets including tactics, techniques, and procedures
in such areas as search and rescue, infiltration/exfiltration, air-ground coordination, maintenance,
and supply. Instruction focuses on how to operate a specific weapon system or support item, and
is not necessarily time or situation specific.
