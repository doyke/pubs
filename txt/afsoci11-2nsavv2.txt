                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction establishes requirements and grading criteria for ground and
flight phases of initial, requalification, and periodic flight evaluations. Aircrew evaluations will
be conducted In Accordance with (IAW) this instruction and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-202,
Volume 2, AFSOC Sup, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. Specific areas for
evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of
aircrews. Flight examiners use this guidance memorandum when conducting aircrew
evaluations. Instructors will use this AFSOCI when preparing aircrews for qualification.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all individuals performing duties on AFSOC
NSAv aircraft.
1.3. Keywords and definitions.
     1.3.1. ―Must‖, ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.3.2. ―Should‖ is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.3.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.3.4. “NOTE” indicates operations procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.
1.4. Waivers. Waiver authority for the accomplishment of individual aircrew items on a case-
by-case basis is Major Command (MAJCOM) Director of Operations (A3) (e.g., HQ
AFSOC/A3). Waiver requests should be submitted through MAJCOM Standardization and
Evaluation (A3V) channels to the HQ AFSOC/A3.
1.5. Supplements. Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation
profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. MAJCOMs will forward a copy
of MAJCOM supplements to HQ USAF/A3O-AT, through HQ AFSOC/A3V, for approval.
Units below MAJCOM level will forward one copy of each supplement to their MAJCOM
Office of Primary Responsibility for prepublication review.
1.6. Evaluation Procedures. Before the aircrew briefing, the evaluator will inform the
examinee of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the conduct,
purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria, prior to
flight (Air Force Reserve Command only: Any unique evaluator inputs to the planned profile
should be communicated to the examinee no later than 24 hours prior to scheduled mission
brief). The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning. If an Operations Planning
Team or Deployment Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is ultimately
responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all mission-planning paperwork. Flight
examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission folders, and any
additional items they deem necessary.
     1.6.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior
     to initial or requalification evaluations.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV2 26 OCTOBER 2012                                                                5


   1.6.2. Unless requested by examinee and approved by squadron supervision, the examinee
   will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation.
   1.6.3. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight. Systems that can be denied in-
   flight are as follows: Navigational aids or displays, Autopilot, Flight Director, flaps for no
   flap landings, primary trim controls, or Power Control Lever for Manual Override Lever
   operations (PC-12). Examiners may use reduced power settings for simulated engine out
   maneuvers.
       1.6.3.1. Under no circumstances will a pilot or loadmaster (if applicable) flight examiner
       allow a multi-engine aircraft to slow below one engine inoperative minimum control
       speed (VMCA), regardless of airspeed tolerances listed for specific areas.
   1.6.4. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief or critique all aspects of the flight. During
   the critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific
   deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.
1.7. Grading Instructions. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202,
Volume 2, AFSOC Sup, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and this AFSOCI.
Examiners will use the criteria contained in this instruction to accomplish all flight and
emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight
examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.
   1.7.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
(Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
       1.7.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory
       knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
       tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
       1.7.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
       tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.
       Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or
       jeopardize flight safety.
       1.7.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
       parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures or tolerances that adversely affected
       mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an
       area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of
       the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively improve examinee’s
       performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief
       the examinee.
   1.7.2. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
   member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
   receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
   also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by ―(Critical)‖ in the area title.
1.8. Evaluation Requirements. Evaluation profiles will reflect a sampling of the unit’s
missions. Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas. Areas common to all
crew members are contained in Table 2.1. Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1.
 6                                                   AFSOCI11-2NSAvV2 26 OCTOBER 2012


Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter. Each crew
specific chapter defines required events. Evaluation methods are identified by NOTES in the
crew specific tables and include: In-flight only; in-flight and/or in simulator (see paragraph
1.8.1.); and in-flight and/or alternate methods (see paragraph 1.8.2.). For areas without a NOTE,
flight examiners may evaluate at their discretion if observed. If required events are not observed,
then the evaluation is incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight.
     1.8.1. Simulator. Weapon System Trainers may be used to accomplish evaluations if
     certified by HQ AFSOC/A3. Do not conduct two consecutive evaluations in the simulator
     (EXCEPTION: Instrument evaluations.).
        1.8.1.1. If an area/subarea was not able to be evaluated in-flight, and the event is
        certified for evaluation purposes in the simulator, it can be evaluated in the simulator to
        complete the evaluation. Document in the comments section of AF Form 8, Certificate of
        Aircrew Qualification, which portion(s) of the evaluation were conducted in the
        simulator.
     1.8.2. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in-flight due to
     equipment malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, the
     area may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., procedural trainer or verbal examination).
     If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate
     method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight.
     1.8.3. Grading Criteria. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the
     grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when
     the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered. Flight examiner
     judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. Consider cumulative
     deviations when determining the overall grade.
        1.8.3.1. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
        aircraft. In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the examinee
        applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety.
1.9. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart
jeopardizing safety, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the
examiner’s Flight Duty Period (FDP) does not exceed AFI 11-202 Volume 3, AFSOC Sup,
General Flight Rules, maximum FDP for an un-augmented crew. This does not mean the
examiner must assume the examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed.
If the examiner feels the examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not
required to assume the examinee’s duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the
examinee’s duties, assign a Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade.
     1.9.1. Evaluators must report deviations or discrepancies from established procedures or
     directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to the squadron or group
     commander, along with evaluator’s recommendation for corrective action, IAW AFI 11-202,
     Volume 2, AFSOC Sup, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
1.10. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training at
their discretion. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
AFSOC Sup, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. Any approved training device or
medium may be used for additional training.
AFSOCI11-2NSAvV2 26 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  7


   1.10.1. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation,
   provided the unique situation presents a valuable training opportunity (i.e., crosswind
   landings), and the discrepancy requiring the additional training will not result in overall Q-3
   evaluation. This option requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The
   examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.11. Rechecks. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the
one who administered the original evaluation.
1.12. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for events that
are not universal to all members in that crew position. Special qualification evaluations may be
conducted separately or in conjunction with the qualification or mission evaluations. After
qualification, areas can be graded as part of periodic mission evaluations. There are no requisites
for special qualification evaluations unless specified. Refer to the appropriate crew position for
any special qualification evaluation requirements.
   1.12.1. Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8. Document IAW AFI 11-202, Volume
   2, AFSOC Sup, as a SPOT evaluation. Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crew
   members qualified, this documentation is still required due to intrafly and permanent change
   of station issues.
1.13. Flight Evaluation Worksheets. AFSOC Form 48 or AF Form 3862, Flight Evaluation
Worksheet or electronic equivalent (Patriot Excalibur) are permitted to assist with the evaluation.
If a flight evaluation worksheet is used, it must be current in relation to requirements outlined in
this instruction and evaluation tables.
1.14. Multiple Qualification. Each aircraft requires a separate Qualification (QUAL), Mission
(MSN), and Instructor evaluation. The Instrument (INSTM) evaluation will be maintained in the
most complex aircraft flown by the examinee (i.e., aircraft with retractable gear, multiengine
aircraft, etc.). Squadron Standardization/Evaluation will determine complex aircraft priority.

                                           Chapter 2

                                     ALL EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions
and all evaluations. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required
duties safely and effectively. This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW
applicable technical orders, instructions, and directives.
2.2. Requirements. Evaluate all crew members on areas listed in Table 2.1.
     2.2.1. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations
     as a requisite to periodic evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, AFSOC Sup. Pilots will
     complete the instrument examination as a requisite to periodic INSTM evaluations IAW
AFI 11-202, Volume 2, AFSOC Sup, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program and
AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program (IRP). QUAL and MSN examinations may be
combined and given as one examination. Reference AFI 11-202, Volume 2, AFSOC Sup,
Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, for required number of questions and test
question structure.
     2.2.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). An EPE is a requisite for all QUAL and
     MSN evaluations except for special qualification evaluations. EPEs may be conducted
     verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another method determined by the examiner or unit
     stan/eval. Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation may develop EPE guides for
     each crew position for flight examiner use. EPEs should be scenario driven, and tailored to
     the specific crew position. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s
     qualification and experience level. Examiners should include other general knowledge areas
     as well. For mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations. EPEs
     will include sufficient in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the examinee’s
     knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction.
        2.2.2.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in flight. The
        examinee should recite all Critical Actions Procedures from memory and should provide
        the initial steps of the emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would
        not allow time for reference.
        2.2.2.2. Grading criteria for EPE are outlined in area 5 of General Grading Areas.
     2.2.3. Publications Check. Required for all INSTM, QUAL, MSN, or combined
     evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL/MSN) as outlined in area 12 of General Grading Areas.
     2.2.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
     Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, crew resource management skills
     will be evaluated during initial and periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all
     phases of flight; therefore no specific area titled CRM exists. CRM skills are imbedded
     within specific grading criteria (mission planning, airmanship/situational awareness, crew
     coordination, communication, risk management/decision making, task management, and
     briefing/debriefing) and include all of the skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills
     Criteria Training/Evaluation Form. Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031 is unnecessary for
     evaluations.

                              LOADMASTER EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. All loadmasters require QUAL and MSN evaluations.                   Instructors will
demonstrate instructor duties on all periodic evaluations. To promote efficient use of aircraft and
resources, the QUAL and MSN evaluations may be combined IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
AFSOC Sup. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all loadmaster
duties safely and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems IAW with
applicable technical orders/AFM/POH, instructions, and directives.
   5.1.1. Loadmaster evaluations will be flown on the most complex aircraft determined by
   squadron DOV. Primary aircraft will be determined by squadron DOV.
   5.1.2. After MSN qualification in their primary aircraft, loadmasters may obtain MSN
   qualification in other secondary aircraft. Waiver authority to obtain INIT MSN qualification
   in other than the primary aircraft is Operations Group Commander.
5.2. Requirements. Refer to Chapter 2 for general and Chapter 3 for instructor grading areas
and criteria. Loadmaster specific areas and criteria are listed in this chapter.
