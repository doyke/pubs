residing in public law, executive orders, higher headquarters directives and major command
publications pertaining to the Airman and Family Readiness Centers. This publication directly
supports guidance in AFI 36-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Programs.

This publication applies to all ACC units, Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve
Command associate units. It applies to non-associate, ACC-gained ANG units when an
equivalent National Guard Bureau-approved and published ANG C&SRL does not exist. It does
not apply to AFRC units which are not an associate program.

1. The Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary items
used during the Air Combat Command Inspector General (HQ ACC/IG) Unit Compliance
Inspection (UCI) to access unit compliance with guidance governing each particular area of
operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the HQ ACC staff [and Air National Guard
(ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (for associate units only) as applicable], and based
upon existing “by-law” requirements, Executive Orders, Department of Defense directives, Air
Force (AF) and ACC guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF, ACC and/or ANG
leadership to assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The
objective of the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required
capabilities.
    1.1. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO) represent the highest priority of inspection items
    and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the
    mission areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core
    Compliance Items (CCI) and General Compliance Items (GCI) may be stand alone or
    subordinate to a CCO. It is the intent of the evaluation team to inspect 100% of the CCOs (as
    a minimum) that apply to the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the
    scope of the inspection during the UCI. Critical, core and general compliance criteria are
    defined as follows:
    1.2. CCO. This is an area or item where unit failure to comply with established guidance
    could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or significant mission
    impact. Key mission areas are:
    - Airman development programs
    - Ability to deploy forces
    - Ability to employ forces
    CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.1. CCI. This is an item or area that requires special vigilance and is important to the
       overall performance of the unit, but is not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance would
       result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or
       possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.2. GCI. This is an item or area deemed fundamental to successful overall
       performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
       accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation. GCIs are
       shown in sentence case format.

Compliance and Standardization Requirements List (C&SRL)—A comprehensive list of
items drawn from numerous directives that help determine unit compliance with public law,
executive orders, Department of Defense, and Air Force directives.
Core Compliance Item (CCI).—An item or area that requires special vigilance and is important
to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance would
result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or possible
litigations.
Critical Compliance Objective (CCO).—An area or item where unit failure to comply with
established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or
significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
- Airman development programs
- Ability to deploy forces
- Ability to employ forces
General Compliance Item (GCI).—An item or area deemed fundamental to successful overall
performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation
