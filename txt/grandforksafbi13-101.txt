This instruction establishes procedures to be used for flying, airfield, and airfield vehicle
operations at Grand Forks Air Force Base (GFAFB). It implements policy guidance in AFPD
11-2, Flight Rules and Procedures, and AFPD 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airspace, Airfield, and
Range Management, and applies to all personnel conducting flying and airfield operations at
GFAFB. It furnishes pilots and other interested personnel with procedures to be used in the
control of aircraft at GFAFB and prescribes policy, responsibilities, and procedures for the
control of motor vehicle traffic on the airfield. These procedures, although directive in nature,
do not replace good judgment on the part of all personnel concerned. These procedures are
supplemental to AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, AFI 13-204 Volume 3, Airfield
Operations Procedures and Programs, AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle
Driver, FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control and other applicable Air Force and Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) directives. The 319th Air Base Wing Commander (319
ABW/CC) is the waiver authority for this instruction. Ensure that all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained In Accordance With (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW with the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

   RAPCON's airspace. It enters near Cooperstown to the southwest and exits near Park River
   to the northwest. Aircraft on IR 678 operate at 3,000 ft MSL and below.
2.5. Controlled Airspace. See Attachment 3 for airspace map.
   2.5.1. RAPCON controls the Class E airspace covering 4,200 square miles over northeastern
   North Dakota and a small portion of northwest Minnesota. Within this airspace, there are
   two main airports (GFAFB – RDR and Grand Forks International Airport – GFK) and nine
   satellite airfields. This Class E airspace is from the surface to 10,000 ft MSL (the actual
   floor where Class E starts differs throughout the airspace, from the surface to 1,200 ft AGL,
   depending on proximity to airports with precision approaches.) It provides the following
   services:
      2.5.1.1. Advisories, separation, and sequencing to Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) aircraft
      landing at or departing from GFAFB and transitioning through GFAFB’s airspace.

   2.5.3. Grand Forks Tower’s airspace is Class D and extends from the surface to 3,300 ft
   MSL. It encompasses a 4.2 NM radius around the airport and is adjacent to Red River
   Tower’s airspace directly to the west.
2.6. Runways, Taxiways, Ramps, Restricted Areas, and Permanently Closed Portions of
the Airfield. See Attachment 4 for a comprehensive airfield diagram.
   2.6.1. Runway. Runway 17/35 published dimensions are 12,351 ft long and 150 ft wide
   with 25 ft non-load bearing shoulders. The runway is composed of 1,100 ft of concrete on
   both ends of a 10,151 ft asphalt strip. The runway lacks any form of aircraft arresting
   system. The overruns at each end are 1,000 ft long and consist of non-load bearing asphalt.
   Runway 35 is the primary instrument runway and it will be selected for use as the ―calm
   wind runway‖ when existing wind speed is less than five knots. NOTE: The FAA
   definition of calm wind is a velocity of less than three knots.
   2.6.2. Taxiways. There are eleven main taxiways (Alpha, Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Alpha 3, Alpha
   4, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, and Golf). All taxiways are 75 ft wide and
   composed of concrete with 50 ft non-load bearing shoulders and are weight bearing capable
   for heavy aircraft. Taxiways Alpha 1- Alpha 4 have 25 ft non-load bearing shoulders.
   2.6.3. Ramps. There are two main parking ramps (Bravo and Charlie). Bravo Ramp is
   adjacent to AMOPS and is used primarily for transient parking. Charlie Ramp consists of 31
   parking spots and is considered the primary parking area. There are no parking restrictions
   on the airfield.
   2.6.4. Restricted Areas. Charlie Ramp and Bravo Ramp are restricted areas only when
   aircraft are present, all other times they are controlled areas. Red lines depict the boundary
   of the restricted area. Entry control points (ECP) located at the north and south end of the
   Charlie Ramp and the five ECPs located on Bravo Ramp will be utilized at all times when
   aircraft are present and to the maximum extent possible when they are not.
   2.6.5. Permanently closed portions of the airfield.        Parking spot C-12 is the only
   permanently closed portion of the airfield.

   consists of:
      2.7.1.1. The runway and overruns.
      2.7.1.2. A 75 ft perimeter around the runway/overruns to include the runway lights and
      runway distance markers (the markers are 75 ft from the runway).
      2.7.1.3. The first 150 ft of all taxiways leading from the runway.
      2.7.1.4. The CMA is depicted as the shaded area on Attachment 4.
   2.7.2. Tower controls all vehicles requiring access to the CMA except when the Tower is
   closed. Aircraft, vehicles, and pedestrians must establish and maintain two-way radio
   contact with the Tower and receive approval before entering the CMA and report exiting the
   CMA. Only vehicles used in direct support of mission essential activities are authorized to
   operate on the CMA.
GRANDFORKSAFBI13-101 28 MARCH 2012                                                                  11


   2.7.3. All other airfield/flightline areas where aircraft operate are designated as non-CMA.
   Vehicles and personnel operating in these areas are not required to establish radio contact
   with the Tower; however, personnel should continuously monitor the Tower Net in the event
   of unforeseen circumstances. Tower is not responsible for vehicles operating on the non-
   CMA.
2.8. Visual and Radio Blind Spots.
   2.8.1. Visual Blind Spots. The three main areas on the airfield that Tower is unable to
   visually observe are:
       2.8.1.1. South of BRAVO Ramp hangars.
       2.8.1.2. South-facing sides of Nose Docks.
       2.8.1.3. North of 3-Bay Hangar.
   2.8.2. Radio Blind Spots. There are no known radio blind spots on the airfield.
2.9. Precision Approach Critical Areas. Precision approach critical areas (Attachment 5)
shall be protected IAW AFI 13-204V3 and FAAO JO 7110.65.
   2.9.1. Runways 17/35 ILS Localizer Critical Areas. These areas encompass the rectangular
   area extending from the localizer antenna to 2,000 ft toward the approach end of the runway
   and 150 ft on each side of the runway centerline. It also includes a 50 ft extension behind the
   localizer antenna.
   2.9.2. Runways 17/35 ILS Glideslope Critical Areas. These areas encompass the fan-shaped
   area that extends from the glideslope antenna to 1,300 ft toward the approach end of the
   runway (or runway end, whichever is greater). It covers an area 30 degrees each side of a
   line drawn through the glideslope.
   2.9.3. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). This zone is an 800 ft wide by 200 ft long
   rectangular area centered on the runway centerline, beginning at and extending outward from
   the end of runway, designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground
   vehicles and other aircraft when the ceiling is less than 300 ft, or the visibility is less than 3/4
   statute mile.
       2.9.3.1. The only portion of the POFZ affected at GFAFB is the northwest corner of the
       hammer head on Taxiway Golf. There are no identifying marks or signs to indicate the
       boundaries of the POFZ. However, the TACAN Check Point sign is a visual indication
       that you are outside the POFZ.
       2.9.3.2. When the ceiling is less than 300 ft or the visibility is less than 3/4 statute mile,
       no vehicles over 10 ft high or any vertical aircraft surfaces may penetrate this area when
       an aircraft is less than 2 miles on the final approach course to Runway 17. Horizontal
       aircraft surfaces such as wings may penetrate this surface with no restrictions.
       2.9.3.3. Vehicles more than 10 ft high must be in radio contact with the Tower when
       inside the POFZ and weather conditions dictate the POFZ will be protected.
       2.9.3.4. Tower will advise drivers to hold at or behind the TACAN Check Point sign
       until inbound aircraft have landed. IAW FAAO JO 7110.65, Tower will advise aircraft
       on final approach to Runway 17 when vehicles or aircraft are unable to exit the POFZ.

3.15. Evacuation of ATC and Airfield Management Facilities. Various reasons could cause
an interruption to ATC and/or Airfield Management service, such as facility evacuations due to
bomb threats, approaching tornadoes or high winds, structural damage due to fire or
communications failures. A number of options are available to continue service; therefore, in the
event Tower, RAPCON, and/or Airfield Management are evacuated, the following procedures
will be implemented:
   3.15.1. Tower Evacuation. Base agencies will be notified of Tower evacuation/resumption
   of normal activities on either the PCAS or SCN.
       3.15.1.1. Pattern and local transition flight training is not authorized at GFAFB. Tower
       or RAPCON will direct all transient aircraft conducting practice approaches to depart the
       traffic pattern. AMOPS will issue appropriate NOTAMs. Additionally, based on the
       expected duration of the outage (more than one week), it may be necessary to request
       Combat Communications support through HQ AMC/A3A.
       3.15.1.2. AMOPS will be responsible for ensuring only authorized aircraft start engines
       and taxi.
       3.15.1.3. The VFR pattern and Class D airspace are uncontrolled. Tower frequency
       124.9 shall become the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). Aircraft shall
       broadcast advisories of their position and intentions on the CTAF. Refer to the
       Aeronautical Information Manual for more in-depth information and examples.
       3.15.1.4. Aircraft shall call Departure Control on frequency 318.1 or 118.1 when ready

       and any additional instructions IAW FAAO JO 7110.65.
       3.15.1.5. If a pilot is unable to cancel IFR with RAPCON, the pilot will report the
       landing time to AMOPS who shall, in turn, pass the information to RAPCON.
       3.15.1.6. Aircraft engine runs shall be conducted IAW Paragraph 4.10 TA will conduct
       tow operations IAW Paragraph 4.10, with the exception that towing across the runway
       is not authorized unless approved by AMOPS.
   3.15.2. RAPCON Evacuation. Minneapolis Center shall assume control of RAPCON
   airspace and provide approach control services. As a result, practice radar approaches
   normally provided by RAPCON will be curtailed due to the increased workload placed on
   Minneapolis Center and its inability to see all traffic in and around GFAFB due to equipment
   limitations.
   3.15.3. Both Tower and RAPCON Evacuated.
       3.15.3.1. Tower frequency 124.9 shall become the CTAF. Aircraft shall broadcast
       advisories of their position and intentions on the CTAF. Refer to Aeronautical
       Information Manual for more in-depth information and examples.
       3.15.3.2. Departing aircraft shall call AMOPS for clearance. AMOPS, with the
       assistance of a watch supervisor qualified air traffic controller, will contact Minneapolis
       Center (Sector 24) for the clearance and release, then relay the clearance verbatim to the
       departing aircraft.
GRANDFORKSAFBI13-101 28 MARCH 2012                                                            19


     3.15.3.3. If an arriving aircraft is unable to cancel IFR with Minneapolis Center, the pilot
     will relay the landing time to AMOPS, who will then pass the information to Minneapolis
     Center (Sector 24).
     3.15.3.4. TA will conduct tow operations IAW Paragraph 4.10., with the exception that
     towing across the runway is not authorized unless approved by AMOPS.
     3.15.3.5. AMOPS will activate the SCN in lieu of the PCAS.
     3.15.3.6. Routine access by 319 CS personnel to buildings within the CMA (i.e.,
     localizer, glideslope, etc.) will be discontinued. 319 CS shall coordinate emergency
     access through AMOPS.
     3.15.3.7. Pilots will obtain current weather information from Grand Forks METRO
     frequency 343.5.
     3.15.3.8. Resumption of ATC Service. Both Tower and RAPCON have internal
     procedures for reopening the facilities, notifying on and off-base agencies, and assuming
     control of airspace and traffic. These procedures will be followed when the facilities are
     returned to service.
  3.15.4. Airfield Management Evacuation/Alternate Facility. Airfield Management evacuates
  to its’ alternate facility, Tower/RAPCON, Bldg 699. In the event of an evacuation, Airfield
  Management will bring required equipment and make required notifications IAW local quick
  reaction checklist and AFI 13-204V3.
  3.15.5. Tower Wind Limitations. Tower and RAPCON will be evacuated to AMOPS, Bldg
  528, when sustained winds exceed 78 knots. ATC will notify 319 CES for a structural
  evaluation on the facility and will remain in AMOPS until the structural evaluation deems it
  safe to return to Bldg 699.
  3.15.6. Alternate ATC Facilities. Due to ATC’s ability to release GFAFB’s airspace to
  Minneapolis Center, there are no alternate ATC facilities.

5.7. Opposite Direction Operations.
   5.7.1. ATC has final authority to approve or disapprove opposite direction operations.
   Approval or disapproval is based on other traffic, airport conditions, and weather. Opposite
   direction approaches or departures should be limited to operational need or aircrew training
   requirements.
   5.7.2. Once an aircraft begins an opposite direction approach, that aircraft has priority over
   routine operations to the runway in use.
   5.7.3. Use a 10-mile minimum cutoff limit for separation between IFR/VFR aircraft during
   opposite direction operations. This limit is necessary due to the closure rate of aircraft on
   converging paths. Tower and RAPCON shall utilize the following cutoff points/distances
   during opposite direction operations:
      5.7.3.1. Arrival vs. Arrival: Once an arriving aircraft is at or within 10 miles from the
      runway in use, do not allow the aircraft making an approach to the other runway to
      proceed closer than ten miles to the runway, until the first aircraft does one of the
      following:
          5.7.3.1.1. Makes a full stop landing.
          5.7.3.1.2. Executes a missed approach and is established on a course or at an altitude
          that ensures approved separation.
          5.7.3.1.3. Begins a circling maneuver.
      5.7.3.2. Arrival vs. Departure: Do not allow an arriving aircraft to proceed closer than
      10 miles to the runway, until a departure (low approach/touch and go/stop and go
      aircraft) has crossed the departure end of the runway and is established on a course or at
      an altitude that ensures approved separation.
      5.7.3.3. Departure vs. Arrival: Do not allow a departing aircraft to takeoff when an
      arriving aircraft is at or within 10 miles of the runway, until the arriving aircraft does one
      of the following:
          5.7.3.3.1. Makes a full stop landing.
          5.7.3.3.2. Executes a missed approach and is established on a course or at an altitude,
          which ensures approved separation.
      5.7.3.4. Pilots requesting opposite direction approaches/departures can expect lengthy
      delays when other aircraft are operating on the runway in use.
GRANDFORKSAFBI13-101 28 MARCH 2012                                                           29

5.10. Radar Vector to Initial. Aircraft requesting vectors direct initial will not be vectored
closer than 5 NM, unless otherwise coordinated between Tower and RAPCON.
5.11. Overhead Pattern Procedures. Overhead patterns are not routinely used at GFAFB;
however, they are permitted when flown as depicted in FAAO JO 7110.65. In order to protect
the overhead traffic pattern, Tower shall issue the following instructions to departing aircraft
when an aircraft is in the overhead traffic pattern: "Maintain at or below 2,000 ft MSL until
departure end of runway.‖
5.12. VFR Traffic Patterns. All VFR traffic patterns are to be conducted within Tower’s Class
D airspace under Tower’s control. Traffic pattern weather minima (VFR weather minimums):
500 ft cloud clearance and 3 SM visibility for the VFR traffic pattern to be open. The Tower
Watch Supervisor has the discretion to close the VFR traffic pattern when weather is better than
stated above.

   5.17.2. For the purpose of see-and-avoid, visual observers must be utilized at all times
   except in Class A airspace, restricted areas, and warning areas. The observers may either be
   ground based or in a chase plane. The observer must keep the UAS in sight at all times and
   have two-way communications with the UAS pilot/operator during all phases of taxi and
   flight. Communications must be separate from ATC and cannot be on the assigned primary
   ATC frequency.
   5.17.3. In the event of a lost link, the UAS pilot will immediately notify ATC and follow
   their lost link procedures outlined in their LOA with ATC.
   5.17.4. ATC shall not issue instructions requiring the use of visual separation, sequencing or
   visual approach.
5.18. Helicopter Operations. Helicopters are not assigned to GFAFB, however, helicopter
