This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment Maintenance,
referencing AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 3, C-130 Operations Procedures, and T.O. 1C-130H-1,
Flight Manual USAF Series C-130H Aircraft. This instruction establishes procedures for the
934th Airlift Wing when an aircraft is sealed and assumed as a spare for daily flying operations at
home station. It applies to Operations and Maintenance personnel assigned to 934Airlift Wing
Air Reserve Station (ARS). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change
of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through Major Command (MAJCOM)
publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of the processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at http://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Minor changes were made to update organizational and name changes.
1. Procedures:
   1.1. The flight line Expediter will supply the seals for aircraft in coordination with
   96AS/DOE.
 2                                                         934AWI21-103 29 OCTOBER 2013


     1.2. When the Engineers and Loadmasters –1 preflight has been completed and the aircraft is
     to be sealed, the Engineer, Loadmaster or Crewchief will enter an “informational note” (no
     symbol) entry into the next open discrepancy block of the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
     Discrepancy and Work Document, stating: “INFO-NOTE: Flight Engineer or Loadmaster -1
     preflight C/W on (date)________, @ ______hours Zulu with seal # ______.”
     1.3. The aircraft forms will then be stowed in the battery box. The Engineer, Loadmaster or
     Crewchief will also report the completed time and seal number to the Maintenance
     Operations Center (MOC).
     1.4. When this seal is installed, the aircraft –1 preflight, will remain valid until the
     Maintenance –6 preflight expires, provided the aircraft is sealed, not flown, and documented
     entry control is maintained.
2. Preflight Integrity:
     2.1. Documented entry control into the aircraft is vital to maintain the integrity of the
     aircrew -1 preflight and prevent questionable practices that may void the –1 preflight. 934th
     Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) and 96th Airlift Squadron (AS)/DOE will
     coordinate on all aircraft entries for a new seal, to verify the –1 preflight integrity is
     maintained and to report the new time and seal number to the MOC. Listed below are
     examples of tasks that may not jeopardize the aircrew -1 preflight integrity when coordinated
     with 96 AS/DOE.
     2.2. Tasks:
        2.2.1. Fuel/Defuel/Lox Servicing.
        2.2.2. Tire Servicing.
        2.2.3. Towing.
        2.2.4. Over water preflight on self-contained navigational system, station keeping
        equipment, and identification friend or foe.
        2.2.5. Loadmaster Preflight.
        2.2.6. Aircraft Publications Update.
        2.2.7. Mooring Aircraft.
        2.2.8. Reconfiguration of Aircraft.
        2.2.9. Minor Interior Surface Cleaning.
     2.3. If the seal is broken but the –1 preflight integrity is maintained the following will be
     documented in the AFTO Form 781A: The current “Information Note” entry will be lined out
     and new “Information Note” entry made in the next open discrepancy block stating:
     “INFO-NOTE Seal broken @________ hrs for (Reason) ___________________________
     and Aircraft Resealed @________ hrs with seal #_____________.”
934AWI21-103 29 OCTOBER 2013                                                           3


  2.4. Aircraft are not required to be sealed when preflighted to prepare for Operational
  Readiness Inspections and rotations.
