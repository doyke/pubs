This manual implements Air Force Policy Document (AFPD) 11-2, Aircrew Operations, and Air
Force Instruction (AFI) 11-200, Aircrew Training, Standardization/Evaluation, and General
Operations Structure, by prescribing hostile environment repair procedures (HERP) for all
AFSOC C130s. This manual applies to all AFSOC units. This manual does not apply to Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. This manual does apply to the Air National Guard
(ANG). Remove all non-essential equipment from the aircraft prior to a combat mission. Use
these procedures only when aircraft movement is essential and proper maintenance action is
impractical. Due to the risks involved while utilizing these procedures, selected procedures or
steps are restricted. These procedures are intended to recover the aircraft from austere locations
and should be treated as emergency repairs until the aircraft is recovered to maintenance. Use of
these restricted procedures or steps must be approved by the Aircraft Commander/Group
Commander, Commander, Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF)/Commander, Air
Force Forces (COMAFFOR) for operationally assigned forces. If a combat or contingency
situation makes prior coordination impractical or impossible, complete the necessary procedure
and notify the approval authority at the earliest opportunity. It should be noted that not all
aircrew can accomplish all procedures due to limited equipment and/or differences in aircraft
configurations. Subordinate units are not permitted to supplement this manual. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product,
commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Waiver Authority. Headings not followed by an (A) or (B) require no approval.
Procedures with headings followed by an (A) require aircraft commander approval in a NON-
HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. Procedures with headings followed by a (B) require group
commander/COMAFSOF/COMAFOR approval. Procedures having an (A) before a step require
aircraft commander approval in a NON-HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT for that step of the
procedure.       Procedures    having    a    (B)    before     a  step   require    group
commander/COMAFSOF/COMAFOR approval for that step of the procedure.

Note: If a combat or contingency situation makes prior coordination impractical or impossible,
complete the necessary procedures and notify the approval authority at the earliest opportunity.
1.2. Hostile Environment Repair Tool Kit. Safe and efficient accomplishment of the hostile
environment repair procedures will require the tool kit in Table 1.1. Store this kit in a secure
place aboard each aircraft. Kits will be sealed with either a boxcar seal or wire strap to ensure
security and resistance to unauthorized use/tampering. Local unit procedures will be established
for security, inventory, resealing, and maintenance of these kits. Some National Stock Number
(NSNs) have been provided; however, local purchase substitutions for tools are authorized. (T-

                                 AFSOC C-130 PROCEDURES

2.1. Jumping Battery - Aircraft to Aircraft (A): (T-3).
Note: This procedure is not required on aircraft equipped with a Self-Contained Navigational
System (SCNS). Swap aircraft battery with SCNS battery.
     2.1.1. Position aircraft nose to nose to allow two DC winch power cable(s) to reach.
     2.1.2. Join both aircraft DC winch power cables together using brass extender plugs.
     2.1.3. Place one end of the cable into the DC winch receptacle on the operating aircraft.
     Connect the other end to the external DC power receptacle of the disabled aircraft.
CAUTION: Reduce DC load on disabled aircraft.
     2.1.4. DC power switch to "External DC" position on disabled aircraft.
WARNING: There will be no aircraft fire protection available when the DC power switch is
placed to "External DC".
     2.1.5. Start Gas Turbine Compressor (GTC)/APU on disabled aircraft.
     2.1.6. Air Turbine Motor (ATM) switch (some airplanes) ON.
     2.1.7. ATM/APU generator switch – ON.
Note: It is recommended to start at least one engine and have its generator on line before
disconnecting power cables.
     2.1.8. Jump battery relay using failed battery relay procedures.
2.2. Battery Damaged/Dead (B): (T-2).
     2.2.1. If battery is damaged, disconnect and remove battery from aircraft.
CAUTION: Reduce DC load on aircraft.
Note: On aircraft equipped with a standard 24-volt aircraft battery to power special aircraft
equipment or mission equipment i.e., Inertial Navigation System (INS), use this battery for
engine start. If another aircraft is available, temporarily place the operable battery of the other
aircraft in the disabled aircraft until at least one engine is operating.
     2.2.2. Obtain two 12V or one 24V battery and jumper cables, if available, or suitable heavy-
     duty cable (DC cargo winch cable may be used).
     2.2.3. Option 1: Install brass extender plugs to battery connector (see Attachment 2). (It
     may be necessary to file plugs down to a smaller diameter.)
        2.2.3.1. Option 2: Install brass extender plugs into one end of the DC winch cable and
        plug the other end of the DC winch cable into the external DC receptacle (see
        Attachment 2).

       2.6.3.2. Remove and replace current limiter with proper spare (275 amp max, 200 amp
       min).
          2.6.3.2.1. If no spares are available, open copilot’s upper circuit breaker panel, and
          remove the cargo winch current limiter, and use as a replacement for GTC.
AFSOCMAN11-201 5 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     11


       2.6.3.3. If the current limiter is good, check the GTC starter for broken wires and repair
       as necessary.
   2.6.4. Connect battery and attempt start. If no rotation, tap GTC starter relay and attempt
   another start.
2.7. GTC Rotates No Light Off: (T-3).
   2.7.1. Check oil quantity.
   2.7.2. Attempt to start while depressing the oil primer button.
Note: A failed speed switch may prevent starter engagement up to 35 percent and/or the bleed air
valve to open at 95 percent. If this occurs proceed as follows:
       2.7.2.1. (A) Remove Speed Switch cannon plug, place No. 16 jumper wires with pins
       from kit, from pin A to pin E (95 percent) and pin D to pin B (110 percent), and pin D to
       pin C (35 percent).
   2.7.3. Start GTC. At approximately 35 percent pull wire from D to C out.
Note: After starting an engine, remove power from GTC and remove jumper wires.
2.8. GTC Stalls & Fails to Accelerate "On Speed": (T-3).
   2.8.1. Hold fingers over the acceleration limiter holes (see Attachment 4) while an assistant
   starts the GTC.
Note: It may be necessary to burp the GTC (place and remove fingers several times during start
cycle) until it sustains itself. If GTC still will not start use the following steps.
   2.8.2. Use petcock drain on bottom of aircraft below GTC to drain fuel while motoring GTC,
   then attempt to start. This will eliminate possible fuel vapor lock.
   2.8.3. If no fuel is present at petcock drain, check GTC fuel shutoff valve operation by
   momentarily positioning GTC control switch to START then OFF.
   2.8.4. (A) If the fuel shutoff valve fails to operate, remove cannon plug from valve located
   behind left armpit panel and open manually (see Attachment 5).
   2.8.5. (A) If the fuel shutoff valve operates properly, remove the fuel line at the GTC burner
   can and motor the GTC until a steady stream of fuel is observed (this step may have to be
   repeated several times).
   2.8.6. Reconnect the fuel line and attempt another start.
2.9. Starting GTC with Failed Oil Pressure Switch (B): (T-2).
Note: A failed oil pressure switch can be detected during the start cycle when no ignition is
heard or when fuel is present at the fuel regulator drain, and no fuel is present at the fuel nozzle.
   2.9.1. Check oil quantity.
   2.9.2. Remove the line to the oil pressure switch (see Attachment 4). Momentarily crank
   GTC (oil should spurt).
   2.9.3. Reconnect the oil line.
 12                                                AFSOCMAN11-201 5 SEPTEMBER 2013


   2.9.4. Remove the oil pressure switch cannon plug, place No. 16 jumper wires with pins
   from kit, from pin A to pin B (ignition) and from pin C to pin D (fuel). Secure with tape.
   2.9.5. Start GTC.
CAUTION: The GTC will not shutdown if oil pressure is lost when the oil pressure switch is
jumped. Damage may occur.
2.10. APU Fails To Rotate (No Start Light, or Momentary Flicker): (T-3).
   2.10.1. Check the following:
       2.10.1.1. APU control circuit breaker.
       2.10.1.2. APU fire control handle.
       2.10.1.3. Isolated bus powered.
       2.10.1.4. Check APU door to ensure fully open.
       2.10.1.5. Auto start relay (ASR) on the APU (upper relay) may be inoperative. Swap the
       ASR relay and the fuel holding relay (FHR, lower relay) (see Attachment 6).
   2.10.2. Attempt another start.
CAUTION: Anytime the APU door actuator is inoperative, and an alternate method is used to
operate the APU, the door will not close when the fire handle is pulled. This may affect
firefighting and containment.
2.11. APU Door Actuator Fails (A): (T-3).
   2.11.1. Remove power from aircraft.
   2.11.2. Pull the APU CONTROL circuit breaker on the pilot’s side panel.
   2.11.3. Remove the APU compartment access panel and unsnap the APU heat shield blanket
   in the upper compartment.
   2.11.4. Remove the actuator cannon plug and install on the APU (failed actuator) start
   receptacle.
Note: If the APU actuator has failed in a position that leaves the APU door opened more than
approximately two inches, use of the APU dummy actuator rod is required. If the door is
opened more than approximately two inches, the end of the door will make contact with the
fuselage when the actuator is moved to the forward mount position.
   2.11.5. Option 1:
       2.11.5.1. Remove cotter pins, nuts, and washers from bolts, remove bolts from both the
       air intake door and the hinge fitting (see Attachment 8).
       2.11.5.2. Remove or cut the ground wire from the door actuator motor to the fuselage.
       2.11.5.3. Remove the inoperative door actuator.
       2.11.5.4. Install the dummy actuator rod. If not preset, adjust rod as necessary to ensure
       door is opened 15° (4.5”).
       2.11.5.5. Reinstall the heat shield blanket and secure the APU access panel.
AFSOCMAN11-201 5 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 13


       2.11.5.6. Apply aircraft power and reset APU CONTROL circuit breaker.
       2.11.5.7. Start APU, start one aircraft engine, remove bleed air load on APU after the
       first engine has been started.
CAUTION: If the APU door is opened to 15° instead of the normal ground position of 35°, delay
operating the APU until immediately prior to engine start, and then only run long enough to
start one engine. In-flight operation is not restricted. Upon landing, delay APU start until just
prior to shut down. Limit the amount of time the APU is operated to a minimum.
   2.11.6. Option 2 (GROUND OPERATION ONLY): CAUTION: If this procedure is
   used, APU emergency electrical power will not be available in-flight. When possible, the
   preferred procedure is use of the dummy actuator rod.
       2.11.6.1. Remove the actuator mount bolt from the fuselage and reposition the actuator
       to the INOP position (forward mount hole) (See above note, Paragraph 2.11.4).
       2.11.6.2. Apply aircraft power and reset APU CONTROL Circuit Breaker.
       2.11.6.3. Start the APU.

       pressure.
       2.11.6.5. Shutdown APU.
       2.11.6.6. Reposition the actuator and mount bolt to close APU door.
       2.11.6.7. Reinstall the heat shield blanket and secure the panel.
2.12. APU Fails To Rotate (Start Light On) (A): (T-3).
   2.12.1. Remove all electrical power.
   2.12.2. Open pilot’s side circuit breaker panel.
   2.12.3. Check APU current limiter, if bad or suspect, replace as follows:
       2.12.3.1. Disconnect battery.
       2.12.3.2. Remove and replace current limiter with spare (275 amp max, 200 amp min).
       2.12.3.3. If no spare is available, open the copilot’s upper circuit breaker panel, remove
       the cargo winch current limiter, and use as a replacement for the APU.
       2.12.3.4. If current limiter is good, check the APU starter for broken wires, repair as
       necessary.
   2.12.4. Connect battery and attempt another start. If no rotation occurs, tap starter relay and
   attempt another start.
2.13. APU Rotates No Start No Ignition Noise (A): (T-3).
   2.13.1. Fuel holding relay (FHR) on the APU (lower relay) may be inoperative. Swap relay
   with auto start relay (ASR) (upper relay) to check operations (see Attachment 6).
   2.13.2. Start APU. If the APU will not start go to Paragraph 2.14.3.
 14                                                  AFSOCMAN11-201 5 SEPTEMBER 2013


   2.13.3. To ensure the motor operated fuel shutoff valve in the No. 2 dry bay is opening,
   open the fuel strainer drain valve flip down panel (underneath the APU, on the bottom of the
   aircraft). If available, use a drain bucket. Push in the poppet valve while placing the APU
   START switch to START. A heavy flow of fuel from the fuel strainer drain valve indicates
   the motor operated shutoff valve is opening.
   2.13.4. If no fuel is present, go to Paragraph 2.14.5.
   2.13.5. Remove the No. 2 dry bay access panel.
   2.13.6. Locate the APU fuel shutoff valve in the aft left corner of the dry bay. (The valve
   should have an identification tag.)
   2.13.7. Remove and secure the APU fuel shutoff valve cannon plug.
   2.13.8. Manually open the shutoff valve by repositioning the manual lever to the open
   position.
   2.13.9. Reinstall the dry bay access panel.
   2.13.10. Start the APU.
   2.13.11. If the APU does not start, the igniter, exciter, or ignition harness may be faulty.
Note: Another fuel system troubleshooting technique is to verify fuel pressure just prior to the
fuel atomizer.
   2.13.12. Pull the APU CONTROL circuit breaker on the pilot’s side panel.
   2.13.13. Remove the APU compartment access panel.
   2.13.14. Disconnect the fuel supply line at the output side of the fuel solenoid shutoff valve.
   Pull the line away from the fitting to allow the fuel to drain straight down. Use a drain
   bucket if available.
   2.13.15. Reset the APU CONTROL circuit breaker.
   2.13.16. Attempt APU start.
   2.13.17. A steady stream of fuel coming from the open line indicates proper operation of the
   solenoid operated shutoff valve, and fuel cluster components.
   2.13.18. Reconnect the fuel supply line and secure the APU access panel.
Note: Although this particular method will not alleviate the possibility of fuel nozzle or atomizer
problems that are preventing operation of the APU, it will determine if fuel pressure is reaching
the combustion chamber.
2.14. APU Rotates No Start With Ignition Noise (A): (T-3).

   2.21.8. Select the Prop and Engine Anti-Icing Master switch to MANUAL. When engine
   RPM reaches 94% RPM; the acceleration bleed valves should close.
Note: There will be continuous anti-icing on the engine. This will reduce the torque on the
affected engine. It is recommended to operate the affected engine with bleed closed.
WARNING: When the Prop and Engine Anti-Icing Master Switch is in MANUAL, the engine
anti-icing/de-ice systems will be actuated if their respective switches are turned to ON. These
switches normally are turned on during the BEFORE TAKEOFF CHECKLIST. Switches for
the other engines should NOT be turned to ON unless absolutely necessary. The propeller
system should be left off. The engines will experience decreased torque to operate the anti-ice
system. The prop anti-ice/de-ice system will be immediately actuated and cause overheating of
the blade/spinner anti-ice/de-ice systems if the aircraft stays on the ground for longer than the
two cycle limit.
 18                                                 AFSOCMAN11-201 5 SEPTEMBER 2013


WARNING: Do not place the affected engine to Low-Speed Ground Idle during ground
operations. To do so may cause the engine to stall or overtemp.
CAUTION: Torque meter shroud anti-icing will not be operational and icing conditions
should be avoided when using this procedure.
   2.21.9. Engine shutdown – From ground idle GROUND STOP.
2.22. Failed Fuel Shutoff Valve (Geneva Lock) (A): (T-3).

back and forth from Run to Ground Stop. This action may free fuel shutoff valve.
   2.22.1. Open the lower left side engine cowling.
   2.22.2. Using a 5/32" Allen wrench and Geneva lock wrench, remove the defective fuel
   control shutoff actuator (Geneva lock) from the fuel control (3 bolts) (see Attachment 10).
Note: Experience has shown that it is very difficult to gain access to the back bolt. Depending
upon the situation, shearing the bolt head off with a screwdriver prior to removal of the other
two bolts may be advisable. If shearing off the bolt head is accomplished, take care not to lose
the bolt head.
   2.22.3. Using a small screwdriver, insert it into the spline end of the fuel control and rotate
   in a counterclockwise direction until fuel control opens. There will be no fuel leakage from
   where the actuator was removed.
   2.22.4. Disconnect and secure the cannon plug.
   2.22.5. Close the engine cowling.
Note: Tailpipe torching may be observed at light-off and higher than normal turbine inlet
temperature (TIT) can be expected. More than the normal amount of fuel may be observed
coming from the drain mast until the 16% switch is actuated.
   2.22.6. For engine shutdown, place the condition lever to FEATHER.
2.23. Bad Engine Fuel Drip Valve (A): (T-3).
   2.23.1. Use enrichment on the next start. The sudden surge of fuel pressure should close the
   drip valve. Tailpipe torching may be observed at light-off.
   2.23.2. If the drip valve still does not close, remove line aft of the bulkhead (see
   Attachment 11) using a wrench and install a No. 4 AN plug provided in the HERP kit.
2.24. Prop Fails To Rotate (No Light In Button) (A): (T-3).
   2.24.1. If the starter button is pushed in and the propeller fails to rotate, use normal trouble-
   shooting procedures. The possibility exists for a lack of electrical power to the starter button.
   All starter buttons share a common power source. Select a starter button for an engine that is
   not operating (do not open the engine bleed air valve), and push both starter buttons
   simultaneously. If this was the problem, the engine will rotate and start normally. Both
   buttons must be held in until 60% RPM.
2.25. Prop Fails To Rotate Failed Bleed Air Valve (A): (T-3).
   2.25.1. Open the affected engine horse collar panel.
AFSOCMAN11-201 5 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  19


   2.25.2. On aircraft equipped with bleed air regulators, manually lock the valve in the open
   position.
   2.25.3. On aircraft equipped with bleed air valves, open horse collar, then using a rubber,
   plastic, or wooden hammer handle, firmly hit the motor mechanism of the bleed air valve.
   (Not the solenoid).
   2.25.4. (B) If this fails to open the valve, remove the motor from the valve. Manually open
   the valve and secure lever to one of the mount holes with safety wire.
   2.25.5. Close horse collar and attempt another start.
CAUTION: If an emergency arises requiring bleed air for this engine to be shutoff, the engine
shutdown procedure will be required.
2.26. Severe Fuel Leaks (B): (T-2).
   2.26.1. Fuel leaks from bullet holes can be plugged by screwing or driving wooden plugs
   into the holes. Cut or break off plugs flush with the wing surface.
2.27. Failed Radome Anti-Icing Valve (Stuck Open) (A): (T-3).
   2.27.1. Recognized by a rapid drop in bleed air pressure, a slight vibration in the flight deck
   floor and/or the sound of rushing air during the bleed air check. To verify the bleed air valve
   is stuck, enter the nose wheel well and listen for rushing air coming from the right upper side
   of the wheel well (see Attachment 12).
   2.27.2. Ensure the Radome Anti-Icing Switch is OFF.
   2.27.3. Deplete bleed air pressure from manifold.
   2.27.4. Tap the shutoff valve with a mallet (see Attachment 12).
   2.27.5. Perform a bleed air check.
   2.27.6. If the anti-icing valve is still stuck open, deplete bleed air pressure. Enter nose wheel
   area and locate the filter in the bleed air manifold prior to the valve in the right forward area
   of the wheel well (see Attachment 12). Disconnect the line from the filter. Follow the line
   down to a T fitting located between the filter and the regulator. At the bottom of the T fitting
   is a cap used to drain moisture from the bleed air manifold. Remove cap and reinstall the cap
   below the filter. Capping this line will prevent air from going to and through the regulator to
   the diaphragm in the valve (this prevents the valve from opening).
   2.27.7. Perform a bleed air check.
2.28. Failed Ignition Relay (A): (T-3).
   2.28.1. Pull the Ignition Control circuit breaker.
   2.28.2. Open the lower left-hand engine cowling and locate the ignition relay. Using vice
   grips or channel lock pliers, disconnect the cannon plug and install the prewired cannon plug
   from the kit and secure (if plug is not available, jump pins C, D, and E together using safety
   wire) (see Attachment 14).

2.30. C130 Operations With Suspected Fuel Tank Foam Fire (B): (T-2).
Note: These procedures are for when it is essential to operate the aircraft, and inspections by
appropriate maintenance personnel are not practical or possible.
   2.30.1. Warner Robins Air Logistics Center engineers have determined if a fuel tank flash
   fire is suspected, and the tank is not leaking, then no structural damage has occurred. If the
   fuel quantity system is operational, the fire was of low order, and if the vent is open, another
   fire will not result in damage.
   2.30.2. Normally, maintenance personnel will determine whether immediate tank entry is
   warranted or if the aircraft can continue to operate until the fuel tank is entered for
   normal/routine fuel tank maintenance.
   2.30.3. During operations at bare base locations where maintenance is not available, the
   flight engineer will make the following inspections prior to the aircraft commander making a
   determination for continued operation.

   2.31.6. Remove and wipe atmospheric sump dipstick (see Attachment 15), insert and lock
   dipstick in dipstick tube, then remove dipstick again. Check fluid level, using the table in
   Table 2.2, measure the amount of fluid on the atmospheric dipstick from lower tip of
   dipstick to the fluid mark.
Note: The fluid height measurements are intended to be approximate. If the measurement falls
between two numbers in the following table, round up or down to the nearest number.
   2.31.7. Add the fluid level on the atmospheric dipstick to the fluid level observed in the
   pressurized sump (see Paragraph 2.31.4). RESULT: For a properly serviced propeller there
   should be 1 quart (2 inches) of fluid in the atmospheric sump when the pressurized sump
   dipstick indicates full (6 quarts). The Pump Housing which includes both sumps holds a total
   of 7 quarts.
Example: If the pressurized sump is 1 quart low (5 quarts) and the atmospheric sump is reading
2 quarts (3 3/4 inches) 5 + 2 = 7 quarts, then the control is properly serviced.
   2.31.8. If fluid level is low, add fluid to control. Fill the control through the valve housing
   cover as follows:
       2.31.8.1. Remove valve housing cover cap (see Attachment 15).
       2.31.8.2. Service the required amount of hydraulic fluid that was determined from
       Paragraph 2.31.6 to the control. Use MIL-H-87257 (preferred) or MIL-H-83282
       (alternate) and pour the required amount of fluid into the control through the valve
       housing cover cap.

         2.31.8.3. Ensure pressurized sump filler cap is secured with locking pin and safety wire.
         2.31.8.4. Close and secure valve housing cover cap.
         2.31.8.5. Install removed access panels.

2.32. Continued Flight With Prop Low Oil Light After Servicing Has Been Checked
(B): (T-2).
      2.32.1. If it has been determined that a propeller is fully serviced and the prop low oil light
      for that engine remains illuminated due to an electrical failure in the indicating system (failed
      float switch), flight to a location with repair capabilities may be continued after receiving
      proper approval. The crew must closely monitor RPM, gearbox oil pressure, and conditions
      for the affected propeller as further malfunctions may be difficult to detect. En route stops
      are NOT authorized.

                          AFSOC C-130J SERIES PROCEDURES

3.1. APU Door Actuator Fails (A): (T-3).
   3.1.1. Accomplish the Before Leaving Aircraft Checklist.
   3.1.2. Disconnect aircraft batteries.
   3.1.3. Remove the APU compartment access panel and unsnap the APU heat shield blanket
   in the upper compartment.
   3.1.4. Remove the actuator cannon plug and install on the APU (failed actuator) start
   receptacle.
Note: If the APU actuator has failed in a position that leaves the APU door opened more than
approximately two inches, use of the APU dummy actuator rod is required. If the door is
opened more than approximately two inches, the end of the door will make contact with the
fuselage when the actuator is moved to the forward mount position. To install the APU dummy
rod, follow steps provided in Paragraph 3.1.5.
   3.1.5. (A):
       3.1.5.1. Remove cotter pins, nuts, and washers from bolts, remove bolts from both the air
       intake door and the hinge fitting.
       3.1.5.2. Remove or cut the ground wire from the door actuator motor to the fuselage.
       3.1.5.3. Remove the inoperative door actuator.
       3.1.5.4. Install the dummy actuator rod. If not preset, adjust rod as necessary to ensure
       door is opened 15° (4.5”).
       3.1.5.5. Reinstall the heat shield blanket and secure the APU access panel.
       3.1.5.6. Reconnect Aircraft batteries.
       3.1.5.7. Run Power Up checklist.
       3.1.5.8. Start APU, start one aircraft engine, remove bleed air load on APU after the first
       engine has been started.
CAUTION: If the APU door is opened to 15° instead of the normal ground position of 35°, delay
operating the APU until immediately prior to engine start, and then only run long enough to
start one engine. In-flight operation is not restricted. Upon landing, delay APU start until just
prior to shut down. Limit the amount of time the APU is operated to a minimum.
3.2. Hydraulic-Leaking Brakes (A): (T-3).
   3.2.1. Disconnect brake lines from both sides of the brake shuttle valve.
   3.2.2. Use the No. 6 and the No. 8 plugs and caps to seal off brake lines and shuttle valve.
   (If caps are not available, substitute with a dime).
Note: Performance data changes; recommend using Runway Condition Reading of 2 or lowest
Runway Condition Reading available.

3.3. Moving Aircraft with a Flat Main Tire (B): (T-2).
WARNING: This procedure should be used only as a last resort to move an aircraft from a
hostile environment. Reduce aircraft weight as much as possible by unloading cargo, defueling or
burning off fuel. To assist with this procedure, fuel may be transferred from the wing on the side
of the flat tire to the opposite wing. Verify wing tip and propeller clearance.
   3.3.1. Install the main gear towing/jacking fitting on strut with flat tire.
   3.3.2. Install a 10,000 lb chain around top of strut above upper track shoes.
   3.3.3. Connect a 10,000 lb tie-down device to towing device; connect chain and tighten.
   3.3.4. Open strut Schrader valve and bleed all air out of strut slowly.
WARNING: Do not open Schrader valve more than 3/4 turn. Do not allow lower nut to loosen.
Allowing the lower nut to loosen could cause a blowout of the Schrader valve.
   3.3.5. After air is depleted, compress strut by using J bar, strap, chocks, milk stool, or any
   other available means. Aircraft may be taxied up onto shoring to elevate the tire.
   3.3.6. Tighten tie-down device to completely compress strut.
   3.3.7. Remove tire (if required/possible).
   3.3.8. Fly with the gear down and landing gear control circuit breaker pulled.
3.4. Severe Fuel Leaks (B): (T-2).
   3.4.1. Fuel leaks from bullet holes can be plugged by screwing or driving wooden plugs into
   the holes. Cut or break off plugs flush with the wing surface.
3.5. C130 Operations with Suspected Fuel Tank Foam Fire (B): (T-2).
Note: These procedures are for when it is essential to operate the aircraft, and inspections by
appropriate maintenance personnel are not practical/possible.
   3.5.1. Warner Robins Air Logistics Center engineers have determined if a fuel tank flash fire
   is suspected, and the tank is not leaking, then no structural damage has occurred. If the fuel
   quantity system is operational, the fire was of low order, and if the vent is open, another fire
   will not result in damage.
   3.5.2. Normally, maintenance personnel will determine whether immediate tank entry is
   warranted or if the aircraft can continue to operate until the fuel tank is entered for
   normal/routine fuel tank maintenance.
   3.5.3. During operations at bare base locations where maintenance is not available, the
   loadmaster will make the following inspections prior to the aircraft commander making a
   determination for continued operation.
   3.5.4. Inspect the outside of the affected tank for structural damage.
   3.5.5. Inspect the affected fuel tank for leaks. Fuel leaks could indicate possible structural
   damage.
   3.5.6. Ensure the fuel quantity indicator system for the affected tank is operational.
AFSOCMAN11-201 5 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                27


  3.5.7. Ensure the vent screen for the affected tank is clean and the vent system is open by
  transferring fuel into the affected tank and ensuring air flows through the tank.
  3.5.8. Inform proper waiver authority and maintenance quality assurance as soon as details
  are known and a course of action is determined. Inspections by maintenance personnel will
  be performed at the first opportunity. Reports will require the following information:
     3.5.8.1. Type of foam installed (Gray, Blue, Yellow, or Black).
     3.5.8.2. Which tank(s) involved.
     3.5.8.3. Fuel quantity of the tank when fire occurred (If known).
     3.5.8.4. Type of fuel in aircraft fuel tank (e.g., JP-4, JP-5, JP-8, kerosene, commercial jet
     fuel, etc.).
     3.5.8.5. If refueling, type of fuel being transferred and refueling pressure.
     3.5.8.6. Components damaged and extent of the damage.
     3.5.8.7. How was the fire detected (i.e., observed soot/smoke, fuel quantity anomaly,
     venting fuel, wingman observed flash from vent mast, etc.).
     3.5.8.8. If fire occurred in-flight:
         3.5.8.8.1. Mission profile.
         3.5.8.8.2. Flight activity at time fire occurred (if known).
         3.5.8.8.3. Mission duration.
         3.5.8.8.4. If fire occurred on the ground:
             3.5.8.8.4.1. Type activity (preflight, refueling, taxi, etc.).
             3.5.8.8.4.2. Type of power applied to aircraft (external, APU/ATM, engine(s),
             etc.).
