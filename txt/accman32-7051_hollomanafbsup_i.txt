     mental practices that maintain environmental compliance.
     1.1.4. Applicability. This manual provides compliance and pollution prevention standards, guidance
     and directives in accordance with statutes and their regulations affecting ACC installations within the
     continental United States of America. ACC installations located overseas may use this same guidance
     as recommended practices and methods. Environmental funding for overseas locations is provided in
     accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) directives. The Final Governing Standards
     (FGSs) for each ACC installation overseas serve as the primary source for environmental compliance
     standards. The FGS was prepared to meet the requirements of DoD Directive 6050.16, Dod Policy for
     Establishing and Implementing Environmental Standards at Overseas Installations, supplements
     Executive Order 12088 and takes into account the legal obligations of the United States in foreign
     countries. As such the FGS must be followed by overseas managers as the basis for environmental
     compliance overseas.

1.2. HQ ACC/CEV Reporting Requirements. The reporting requirements for various programs are
summarized below. Refer to the specific paragraph for a complete discussion of the reporting require-
ment.
     1.2.1. Upon an Occurrence:
        1.2.1.1. Report Any Environmental Incident. See paragraph 12.2.1.3. (RCS:

        which endanger public health or safety or cause substantial environmental damage, must be
        released publicly within one hour of the incident. Immediately brief the wing commander on the
        details of the incident. Also notify the Wing Public Affairs, Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and local
        detachment of the Office of Special Investigation (OSI). In the case of a hazardous substance or
        petroleum product release, the Environmental Flight Chief notifies all appropriate regulatory
        agencies as prescribed by law. The Environmental Flight Chief recommends to the Wing Com-
        mander whether an Environmental Incident Investigation Board (EIIB) process should be per-
        formed.
        1.2.1.2. Report substance releases to HQ ACC/CEVQ. See paragraph 11.3.1. Notify HQ ACC/
        CEV of all Air Force reportable releases via the world wide web at http://www.cevp.com/spill

       submissions via the ACES-PM system (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)9411) by 1 December of each year
       or when call letters are issued by the command.

1.3. Architectural Compatibilityof Environmental Projects. Environmental compliance projects must
comply with ACC Architectural Standards and base Architectural Compatibility Plans (See AFI 32-1023
ACC SUP 1, Design And Construction Standards and Execution of Facility Construction Projects).
Ensure appropriate reviews are conducted and programming documents include costs for features such as
screening, use of compatible building materials, compliance with color schemes and appropriate signage.

1.4. Facility Demolition. Air Force Handbook 32-9007, Chapter 4, Managing Air Force Real Property,
outlines the general items that need to be addressed for environmental responsibilities and concerns for
real property disposal actions to include AF Form 300, Facility Disposal, the environmental certification
of the facility disposal action form. In May 2001, GSA added a new certificate, Hazardous Substance
Activity Certification, to their requirements before they will dispose of a site. This certificate contains
almost the same information as the Contamination Certificate currently provided. GSA has agreed to
accept the Contamination Certificate in lieu of the Hazardous Substance Activity Certification 1) if the
property has already been reported to GSA for disposal and 2) the Contamination Certificate is current (in
several cases the Contamination Certificate is several years old and GSA is requiring a new Hazardous
Substance Activity Certification) and 3) if it contains the required information. The Environmental Flight
must be involved at a very early date in all facility disposal actions.

1.5. Environmental Permit Policy.
   1.5.1. It is HQ ACC policy to obtain all required environmental permits and to fully comply with all
   permit conditions and actions required by law.
   1.5.2. There are different permit types, to include federal, state, local, regional, county, and others,
   which serve a variety of different purposes. For example, there are permits required to collect and
   store hazardous waste, to install or construct equipment which emits air pollutants, to release storm
   water, to discharge waste waters, and many others. Details about these permits and the policies which

     ACC installations must follow when applying for, operating under and constructing in accordance
     with them, are summarized within each chapter of this manual.
     1.5.3. The purpose of this section of the manual is to define roles, responsibilities for each level of the
     Air Force organization and to review funding methods for the various permit types.
     1.5.4. MILCON:
        1.5.4.1. Headquarters ACC construction project managers will:
            1.5.4.1.1. Work directly with the installation engineering flight on all design and construction
            issues.
            1.5.4.1.2. Notify ACC environmental program managers when MILCON projects are sched-
            uled for design or when projects are in design later when the project is in construction, notify
            ACC environmental program managers of changes or events, which may effect installation

          RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT HAZARDOUS WASTE
                           MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

2.1. General Requirements. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. § 6901
et seq., promulgated in 1976, established statutory requirements that are the basis of the hazardous waste
regulations published in 40 CFR 260 through 280. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments
(HSWA) of 1984 made changes to RCRA and also established regulations applicable to underground stor-
age tanks (USTs) used to store petroleum and toxic chemicals and corrective actions clean-up. Policy and
guidance for the UST program may be found in Chapter 3 and policy for the RCRA corrective actions
program may be found in Chapter 4 to this manual.
     2.1.1. Responsibilities. Management of hazardous waste rests with all individuals who generate it.
     Within ACC, hazardous waste program roles and responsibilities should adhere to the following
     guidelines (Table 2.1., Table 2.2., Table 2.3., and Table 2.4.):

   2.1.2. Policy Guidance:
      2.1.2.1. AFI 10-2501 and AFPAM 32-7043, Hazardous Waste Management Guide, contain perti-
      nent guidance concerning hazardous waste management.
      2.1.2.2. RCRA is the primary statute supported by the HSWA of 1984. The RCRA hazardous
      waste regulations are published in 40 CFR Parts 260 through 273. In summary the regulation
      parts contain the following (Table 2.5.):

Table 2.5. RCRA Hazardous Waste Regulations.

        2.1.2.3. All CONUS states have primacy over the RCRA program except Iowa. State regulations
        may be more stringent than the federal programs and therefore, it is essential base environmental
        managers are familiar with and fully comply with their respective state regulations.
     2.1.3. Applicability. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations,
     ANG, and AFRC units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing com-
     mander. Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordina-
     tion with the host installation.
        2.1.3.1. This guidance does not apply to ACC installations located in foreign countries. For envi-
        ronmental compliance at ACC OCONUS installations and operations, use the more stringent of
        the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), Treaty, DoD Instructions, or Final Governing
        Standards (FGS). If there are local or host nation regulations not covered by these documents, a
        case-by-case determination will be made by HQ ACC/CEV. Overseas ACC locations should use
        requirements in this guidance document for information and to effectively manage their storage
        tank programs.

2.2. Permits. Some ACC bases maintain a RCRA "part B" permit for the storage of hazardous waste
over 90 days. It is ACC policy to eliminate these permits where practical and in the best interest of the
wing mission. Consult with HQ ACC/CEVQ/JAV prior to starting the process to close a permitted storage
facility.

2.3. Hazardous Waste Management:
     2.3.1. Background. All ACC bases manage satellite (initial) accumulation points (IAP) and 90-day
     storage areas. The compliance requirements for these areas within 40 CFR 262.34 are frequently
     interpreted differently. Additionally, EPA region and state regulatory agency have the authority to
     implement and enforce their own interpretation of RCRA regulations. The following guidance is a
     conservative approach to an interpretation of the federal regulations under RCRA. It is the responsi-
     bility of each base to seek and comply with their respective state or EPA region specific requirements,
     but no base should implement procedures that place undue additional burdens on base managers.
     Once a local base policy is written, the Air Force requires the installation to comply with all require-
     ments, and they become subject to ECAMP findings. Therefore, installation shall not develop local
     policies that are above and beyond state and federal regulatory requirements.
     2.3.2. Satellite (initial) accumulation point (IAP) Federal requirements checklist. The following list
     of items is provided to assist base-level hazardous waste managers in complying with IAP require-
     ments, however managers are responsible for verifying their specific regulatory requirements.

      anticipated to encounter it during the course of their duties. This training is also required for per-
      sonnel, such as commanders and public affairs personnel, who, although they may never directly
      encounter hazardous waste, are called upon to make decisions, or communicate information, con-
      cerning personnel and assets involved with hazardous waste.
          2.3.4.1.1. Level I training should consist of an overview of hazardous waste issues including
          roles and responsibilities, emergency response/spill response, safety, and pollution prevention.
          Training avenues can include AFIT training courses, in-house training, videos, newsletters,
          etc. The specific requirement will be based on the audience. Quantity and level of training is
          left up to the MAJCOM, and base environmental flight. The desired learning objectives
          (DLOs) for this level of training are as follows (Table 2.6.):

      2.3.4.2. Operational Training, also known as Level II training, is required for all personnel, and
      their supervisors, who work with hazardous waste on a regular basis. This level will include most
      flight line, maintenance, and shop personnel. It encompasses the IAP workers who generate or
      handle hazardous waste, and must handle it appropriately, but who are not involved in setting up
      or monitoring the system for handling it. Training should typically include information on accu-
      mulation standards (i.e., compatible containers, 55-gallon limit, etc.), potential hazardous waste
      and waste characterization, emergency response, safety, base policy, points of contact, etc. Oper-
      ational Training should include any information that enables personnel to positively impact the
      overall management of hazardous waste. A standard Level II training session should last 1 to 3
      hours. The rapid turnover of personnel demands that this training be available several times a
      year; quarterly is a reasonable frequency. At a minimum, Level II training should include the fol-
      lowing DLOs (Table 2.7.):

             2.3.4.2.1. In-house training can be supplemented using the Hazardous Waste Management
             Interactive Training CD-ROM. The following sections of the interactive training program are
             recommended for Level II trainees (Table 2.8.):

         2.3.4.3. Regulated Training, also known as Level III training, is required for all personnel, and
         their supervisors, who work in 90-day accumulation points, or at interim status or permitted
         TSDFs, or manage the base's hazardous waste program. Level III is focused on personnel who
         characterize waste streams; complete hazardous waste manifests, annual reports, or exception
         reports, remove hazardous waste from accumulation tanks or containers; transport hazardous
         wastes to or from storage and treatment units and disposal facilities; inspect hazardous waste
         accumulation sites; collect hazardous waste samples or conduct other hazardous waste related
         activities as designated by installation commanders or their environmental managers.
             2.3.4.3.1. Level III training can be accomplished through a combination of off-site training
             (i.e., local universities, AFIT, commercial training vendors), in-house training sessions, and
             the use of the Hazardous Waste Management Interactive Training CD-ROM. The com-
             puter-based training is appropriate for Level III training, but must be supplemented with
             site-specific requirements which familiarize the trainee with the actual hazardous wastes, pro-
             tective equipment, control measures and procedures on site, and the hazardous waste related
             activities and responsibilities that they will be required to perform or oversee. The site-spe-
             cific portion of the training may be satisfied through existent workplace orientation or
             on-the-job training programs, however the supervisor must examine the employee's training to
             ensure that the site and task familiarization is accomplished and create a program if necessary.
             At a minimum, Level III training should include the following DLOs (Table 2.9.):

          2.3.4.3.2. Level III personnel should review and pass all the lessons in the interactive training
          program (Table 2.10.):

      2.3.4.4. All personnel requiring Level I, II, or III Hazardous Waste Training must receive annual
      refresher training. Refresher training should be varied in relation to the trainees' needs, and like
      initial training, it should be documented. Level I refresher training can consist of a short briefing,
      such as one portion of a commander's call, or it can be accomplished through the use of a pam-
      phlets, videos, newsletters, or other means according to installation resources.
          2.3.4.4.1. Refresher training for Level II and III personnel should be more extensive and can
          be provided via in-house lecture combined with the Interactive Training Program on
          CD-ROM. The CD-ROM allows users to "test out" of lesson material that they already know,
          therefore a refresher session can be as long or short as is necessary for the individual.
          2.3.4.4.2. Refresher training should include information about any changes in hazardous
          waste procedures circumstances in the local work environment, or changes in the regulations.
30                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


            This can be achieved through an update handout distributed when the individual arrives for
            his/her CD-ROM refresher session.
     2.3.5. Manifest Signature Authority. The person or persons responsible for signing hazardous
     waste shipment manifests must be designated in writing by the installation commander (for ACC
     installations this is the wing commander). However, the commander may transfer this authority to a
     lower commander. In other words the installation commander can designate the BCE or the group
     commander as the approval authority for personnel to sign manifests.
     2.3.6. Specific Hazardous Wastes Issues:
        2.3.6.1. Tank Water Bottoms. The condensate removed from bulk petroleum storage tanks
        (commonly referred to as tank water bottoms) typically tests positive for the presence of benzene.
        As a result, it often requires disposal as a characteristic hazardous waste. However it is possible to
        manage wastewaters of this nature under the CWA (CWA), and avoid the substantive portions of
        RCRA. Any waste that mixes with domestic sewage and passes through a sewer system to a Pub-
        licly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) is not a solid waste under RCRA, and therefore not a haz-
        ardous waste (40 CFR 261.4(a)(1)). What this means is that according to RCRA, tank water
        bottoms can be discharged to a sanitary sewer regardless of any waste characteristics. However,
        this does not mean indiscriminate discharge of hazardous waste to the sanitary sewer. In almost all
        cases, it is likely that the POTW will have its own standards for what discharges are permitted in
        the sanitary sewer system. Any waste discharged will have to meet the pretreatment standards of
        the receiving POTW. In the case of a Federally Owned Treatment Works (FOTW), the on base
        treatment plant must be able to meet its National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
        (NPDES) permit requirements. Therefore, it is ACC policy that coordination with either the
        POTW or FOTW is required prior to discharge. It is quite possible to treat the contaminated water
        to remove the benzene with activated carbon and discharge the remaining water to the sanitary
        sewer. Depending on the exact circumstances, this entire process could be subject to CWA regu-
        lation and not RCRA. In addition, certain land disposal restrictions (LDR) may apply.
        2.3.6.2. Activated Light Sticks. Activated light sticks produced by Omniglow Corporation have
        a flashpoint over 200×F and when disposed need not to be characterized as hazardous waste.
        2.3.6.3. Fluorescent Bulbs:
            2.3.6.3.1. Fluorescent lights contain small amounts of mercury which may exceed the RCRA
            threshold of 0.2 parts per million. In the mid-1980s, mercury was present in small amounts in
            all fluorescent lamps. A standard 4-foot lamp contained approximately 50 milligrams or less
            of mercury, while an 8-foot lamp would contain 75 to 100 milligrams of mercury. By the
            mid-1990s, the level of mercury in the lamps had dropped to about 25 milligrams of mercury
            for a 4-foot lamp. The composition of the bulbs can be obtained from the manufacturer. The
            user may also use the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) to determine if the
            fluorescent bulb contains toxic metals. Composition of the powder in fluorescent bulb may
            also contain barium, cadmium, chromium, and lead. In July of 1999, EPA added fluorescent
            and other lamps to the universal waste rules discussed below.
            2.3.6.3.2. EPA published a final rule on universal wastes in the May 11, 1995 Federal Register
            (60 FR 25492) which established a new part in EPA's hazardous waste regulations, 40 CFR
            273. In this rule, EPA provides a relaxed set of management standards for widely used hazard-
            ous wastes (batteries, mercury thermostats, pesticides, and now fluorescent and other lamps).
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         31


       Under the new set of conditions, these wastes can be stored up to one year at a maximum quan-
       tity of 5,000 kilograms (total of all universal wastes) accumulated at one time without a haz-
       ardous waste storage permit. If a base intends to manage fluorescent bulbs as a universal
       waste, the base can not treat the bulbs by crushing and bulking the bulbs. If the base treats flu-
       orescent bulbs by crushing and bulking, the resulting wastes must be managed as a solid and
       potentially hazardous waste. Several states have added other wastes to the universal waste
       rules. Check your state regulations for the latest information.
    2.3.6.4. Antifreeze:
       2.3.6.4.1. Antifreeze typically does not contain hazardous constituents and is not itself a haz-
       ardous waste. However, antifreeze can become contaminated with toxic metals during use and
       may require management as a hazardous waste. Generators should initially test waste anti-
       freeze to determine if hazardous constituents are being generated as a result of their process.
       After a baseline has been established, annual testing thereafter is usually adequate unless the
       state regulatory agency requires more frequent testing. Some states have added antifreeze to
       their version of the universal waste rules.
       2.3.6.4.2. Almost all ethylene glycol based antifreeze can and should be recycled and reused
       on the installation. There are several brands of recyclers on the market that incorporate either
       filtration or distillation as the means of recycling. Distillation units are much more efficient,
       and only two brands are approved for recycling per MIL-A-46153 antifreeze found in most
       DoD equipment and vehicles. The Cool'r Clean'r Coolant Purification System, manufactured
       by BG Products Inc., and the BE Series Engine Coolant Recyclers, manufactured by Fin-
       ish-Thompson Inc. Using any other equipment may not meet the requirements of the MIL
       standard. Equipment or vehicles that do not require this MIL standard antifreeze may use
       other types or brands of recyclers. It should also be noted that MIL-A-11755, arctic antifreeze
       should not be recycled at all. It can be distinguished from MIL-A-46153 by its fluorescent
       orange color.
    2.3.6.5. Batteries:
       2.3.6.5.1. Recycling Batteries. Lead-acid battery shops frequently recycle lead-acid batteries
       and often dispose of sulfuric acid. Recycling or reclamation of lead-acid batteries does not
       require the batteries to be treated as hazardous waste. However, if the batteries are to be dis-
       posed of then typically these batteries will be hazardous waste and must be disposed as such.
       If a shop drains battery acid into open containers before transfer of the waste corrosive to a
       SAP, then the waste corrosive must also be transferred to the satellite point after draining has
       been completed. The shop must not allow containers to remain open after draining is com-
       pleted. Any spillage of liquids in the shop must be immediately cleaned up as these spills
       could be considered improper disposal of hazardous waste.
       2.3.6.5.2. Waste Batteries. Waste batteries can be hazardous due to the presence of toxic,
       reactive, or corrosive characteristics. Although many types of batteries are currently managed
       as hazardous waste, EPA has established in 40 CFR 273 (11 May 95 Federal Register), for
       management of commonly generated wastes by users not traditionally considered hazardous
       waste generators. Known as the universal waste rule, it allows for less stringent management
       of waste batteries, mercury containing thermostats and certain pesticides. Batteries managed
       under 40 CFR 273 are not subject to the hazardous waste regulations in 40 CFR parts 260
32                            ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


     through 272. The criteria of management under 40 CFR 273 is described after the hazardous
     waste requirements specified for each battery type. It is important to note that although this
     regulation has been approved on a federal level, state regulatory agencies may not have
     adopted it yet.
     2.3.6.5.3. Lithium Batteries. Lithium batteries are used in communications and other elec-
     tronic equipment because of their ability to maintain full voltage. Lithium batteries contain
     sulfur dioxide (70%), acetonitrile (24%), and lithium bromide (6%). The quantity of sulfur
     dioxide decreases as the battery is discharged. Lithium batteries may retain some residual
     charge when unusable, and are characterized as hazardous waste as ignitable and reactive.
     However, a March 18, 1987, document from EPA to the US Army Laboratory Command
     states that lithium batteries that are completely discharged (all cells test at zero volts) are not
     considered reactive, and therefore may not be characterized as a hazardous waste. Some lith-
     ium batteries are equipped with a complete discharge device (CDD). The CDD will com-
     pletely discharge the battery so that it is suitable for disposal as solid waste. Bases should only
     order batteries that come equipped with a CDD. Bases should purchase a lithium battery test
     set to identify batteries that have sufficient charge to be used in equipment to eliminate dis-
     posal of useful batteries.
     2.3.6.5.4. Magnesium Batteries. Magnesium batteries with more than eight hours of charge
     will fail the TCLP for chromium. Batteries with fewer than eight hours of charge contain
     chromium in a form and concentration that will usually not fail the TCLP. Magnesium batter-
     ies are not rechargeable. Ensure that all magnesium batteries are completely discharged and
     tested before disposal.
     2.3.6.5.5. Alkaline Batteries. Alkaline batteries are commonly found in everything from
     flashlights to test equipment. Alkaline batteries have the potential to fail the TCLP for mer-
     cury or other characteristic wastes. Also, some states require a bioassay test for alkali, which
     usually fail for toxicity. Two alternatives to standard alkaline batteries are rechargeable NiCd
     batteries and the new rechargeable alkaline batteries. NiCd batteries can be recharged hun-
     dreds of times before disposal, but are considerably more expensive than alkaline batteries, do
     not last as long, must be carefully used to maintain peak efficiency, may not be useful for all
     types of equipment, and must be disposed of as hazardous waste. The new rechargeable alka-
     line batteries are considerably cheaper than NiCd batteries, do not experience the functional
     capacity loss of NiCd batteries, and can usually be disposed of as solid waste. However, they
     do require a special charger, and can only be recharged approximately 25 times.
     2.3.6.5.6. Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) Batteries. NiCd batteries are used in electronic equip-
     ment that is commonly recharged. NiCd batteries are "environmentally friendly" (i.e., they
     can be recharged hundreds of times before disposal, but are considered hazardous waste for
     the toxicity characteristic when disposed). NiCd batteries can develop a memory that results
     in a very short charge life if they are not completely discharged before recharging. Equipment
     containing NiCd batteries should not be plugged in for recharge just because it is not in use.
     NiCd batteries are recyclable. There are two ways to recycle NiCd batteries: they can be
     regenerated, or they can undergo materials recovery. Note that batteries destined for regener-
     ation at a battery facility are exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste (40 CFR
     261.6(a)(3)(ii)). Batteries destined for materials recovery must be managed as a hazardous
     waste.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         33


       2.3.6.5.7. Mercury Batteries. Mercury batteries are dry cells that contain zinc, mercuric
       oxide, and potassium hydroxide, and are used in night vision equipment. They are regulated
       as hazardous waste due to the presence of mercury, a characteristic waste. Mercury batteries
       should be considered dangerous. Cases of defective batteries bulging and venting have been
       documented in DoD. As with NiCd batteries, mercury batteries can be regenerated or can
       undergo materials recovery depending on their condition at disposal. Batteries destined for
       regeneration into usable products are exempt from hazardous waste regulations. Batteries des-
       tined for materials recovery of the materials must be managed as a hazardous waste.
       2.3.6.5.8. Silver Bearing Batteries. Silver bearing batteries are available in both primary
       and secondary forms, and contain silver chloride, or silver oxide anodes. The electrolyte can
       contain aqueous solutions of lithium chloride, zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, or potassium hydrox-
       ide. Silver batteries often undergo precious metals recovery and are not subject to many
       RCRA requirements due to the silver content (40 CFR part 261.6 and 266.70, precious metals
       recovery). However, silver batteries that contain hydroxides are subject to most RCRA
       requirements due to the corrosive characteristic. If a silver battery is considered hazardous
       only due to the silver, the generator is only responsible to meet the requirements for notifica-
       tion and manifesting (40 CFR part 266.70). Under part 266.70(c), generators must also main-
       tain records proving that the batteries are not being accumulated speculatively. Speculative
       accumulation refers to the storage of solid waste for more than one year for the purpose of
       recycling. The volume of hazardous waste associated with the disposal of these batteries can
       be reduced. If a silver battery is hazardous due to the corrosive electrolyte, the electrolyte can
       be drained and disposed of separately. The electrolyte would be subject to all of RCRA, but
       the battery casing would only be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 266.70.
       2.3.6.5.9. Lead-Acid Batteries. Lead-acid batteries are used for vehicle starting, and more
       recently for computer backup systems. Small, sealed, lead-acid batteries are used in cordless
       telephones and other electronic devices. Unusable batteries discarded for disposal are consid-
       ered hazardous waste due to the toxicity characteristic for lead and the corrosive characteristic
       for sulfuric acid electrolyte. Lead-acid batteries destined for recycling (materials recovery of
       the lead) are not subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 262-266, 270 or 124, or 40 CFR
       266.80. Battery acid drained from any lead-acid battery is considered a hazardous waste and
       must be managed as such.
       2.3.6.5.10. Batteries, Universal Waste Standards:
          2.3.6.5.10.1. Batteries are identified as one of the universal wastes in EPA's final rule of
          11 May 95. These standards apply for waste batteries that would normally be covered
          under hazardous waste regulations, but can be managed under this relaxed set of standards.
          Generators have the option of complying with either rule, therefore, batteries destined for
          regeneration should continue to be covered under the hazardous waste exemption in 40
          CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii) rather than falling under the universal waste standards. The following
          requirements apply for universal wastes under the federal rule:
          2.3.6.5.10.2. Universal wastes must be identified with the date they become a waste (40
          CFR part 273.11). This can be accomplished by labeling the battery, labeling the storage
          area, or maintaining an inventory system.
34                                 ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


              2.3.6.5.10.3. Waste batteries may be stored by the generator or at a consolidation point on
              site for up to one year (40 CFR 273.15). Waste batteries can be stored at the point of gen-
              eration or transferred to a consolidation point on base for up to one year. The total time on
              the installation may not exceed one year (although there are certain exceptions). There are
              no satellite or 90-day provisions under part 273. A consolidation point could be estab-
              lished on base at the 90-day accumulation point, the TSD facility, or any other location that
              meets the conditions in 40 CFR part 273.13. The burden of proof is on the generator to not
              exceed the one-year requirement.
              2.3.6.5.10.4. Within one year of generation, waste batteries must be manifested and
              shipped off site to another consolidation point or to a destination facility for recycling or
              disposal.
              2.3.6.5.10.5. Waste batteries from housing areas are not specifically mentioned in the reg-
              ulatory standards of part 273, however they are discussed in the preamble. According to
              the preamble, although batteries in the municipal waste stream from residential areas are
              exempt from regulation under 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1), once those batteries are collected and
              consolidated they will be managed under part 273. In other words, if the installation has a
              program to collect waste batteries from housing residents, they must be managed in accor-
              dance with 40 CFR part 273, and are no longer completely exempt from regulation.
              2.3.6.5.10.6. Implement actions to reduce the use of batteries as much as possible and
              replace them with power cords. Batteries should only be used when the equipment has no
              viable alternative (i.e., facility electrical system, vehicle power supply, etc). Any given
              application may be supported by more than one type of battery; equipment requirements as
              well as battery characteristics should be considered before purchase. Cost, shelf life, use-
              ful life, disposal cost, chemical make up, and all other factors should be considered. The
              following will address each type of battery, its proper management, and the potential for
              waste reduction or recycling. In most instances, the batteries are reclaimed for their raw
              materials. Table 2.11. gives summarizes details about battery management discussed in
              the previous paragraphs.

         2.3.6.6. Hospital Wastes. Although hospital infectious wastes are not typically a hazardous waste
         problem, many hospital wastes must be properly characterized. Wastes such as expired shelf life
         drugs, solvents, lead shields, and x-ray photo chemicals must be properly managed and disposed
         of. Ensure hospital personnel are adequately trained and aware of their responsibilities.
            2.3.6.6.1. This guidance (Table 2.12.) details the typical status and proper management of
            wastes generated by medical operations. However there are several exemptions, exclusions,
            and other criteria that may require consideration before an item is disposed. This should not
            be considered an exhaustive list of all pharmaceutical wastes.

          2.3.6.6.2. An increasingly common practice is the "reverse-management" of waste pharma-
          ceuticals, (i.e., shipping unused product back to the manufacturer through a middle-man or
          service). 40 CFR 261.2(e) allows returning of materials to a manufacturer to be used as ingre-
          dients to make a product, a substitute for a commercial chemical products, or as a feedstock in
          the original process that generated the material. This is sound business practice that should be
          strongly encouraged when appropriate. However, the regulatory status of these items depends
          on the ultimate use or reuse of the drugs. It is the generator's (i.e., the base's) responsibility to
          know exactly what happens to drugs managed through this system. Improper management or
          disposal, even if by a contractor, will result in legal liabilities for the original generator of the
          hazardous waste (i.e., the installation). As the generator of hazardous waste, the base must
          ensure proper disposal methods are used when writing contract specifications, and periodi-
          cally check contractor performance. Ensure the practices of any "reverse management" con-
          tractor are closely scrutinized.
   2.3.7. Specific Functional Areas:
      2.3.7.1. Organizational Maintenance Shops:
          2.3.7.1.1. Structural Maintenance. Painting and de-painting operations are typically the
          largest hazardous waste generators on base. These wastes are often incorrectly characterized.
          Paint booth filters, sanding residues, bead blast waste, and over spray on masking materials are
          often hazardous waste due to the presence of toxic metals in the dried paint. Unless profes-
          sional knowledge of the process is known, analytical data must be gathered of each waste
          stream to determine its characteristics and whether it must be disposed of as a hazardous
          waste. All paint related waste must be properly characterized before disposal. Dried paint
          waste and sludge must be characterized for the presence of toxic metals, and liquid wastes may
          contain listed or characteristic waste as well. Failure to characterize waste is an enforceable
          violation of RCRA.
          2.3.7.1.2. Life Support. Solvents used to repair life vests and rafts typically contain listed
          hazardous constituents which may include listed solvents. Determine the constituents of prod-
          ucts used. Disposal of expended solvent or rags contaminated with solvent often must be con-
          sidered hazardous waste.

            2.3.7.1.3. Nondestructive Inspection (NDI). If the NDI lab still uses sodium chromate in a
            bath to remove excess penetrate dye then the dye and bath solutions must be analyzed to deter-
            mine if it is hazardous. Dispose of appropriately if it is a hazardous waste. NDI labs can also
            generate silver bearing waste from x-ray processes. Typically, the silver waste is reclaimed
            with a "silver recovery unit" and the remaining effluent is discharged to the sanitary sewer.
            Most other chemicals used by NDI are not listed hazardous waste and do not exhibit hazardous
            characteristics.
     2.3.8. Special Issues:
        2.3.8.1. Part B Permit Elimination:
            2.3.8.1.1. Background. Through the 1980s and early 90s, Part B hazardous waste storage
            permits became standard at many Air Force facilities. The costs and effort to maintain a Part
            B hazardous waste storage permit is excessive, and most ACC bases have eliminated their
            storage facilities.
            2.3.8.1.2. Regulations. Maintaining Part B permits forces us to adhere to a considerably
            higher regulatory standard than a strictly 90-day facility. Permitted TSD facilities typically
            generate a greater level of regulatory scrutiny by the state. Although each state is different,
            permitted facilities generally receive more RCRA inspections than their non-permitted coun-
            terparts, and must follow stricter and more extensive regulations.
            2.3.8.1.3. It is HQ ACC policy to minimize hazardous waste 90 day accumulation points and
            permitted TSDFs where practical and in the best interest of the installation. The goal is to
            maintain full regulatory compliance, but minimize the liability and hazardous waste profile to
            only necessary activity and processes.
        2.3.8.2. Off-site Non-DoD Waste. ACC installations will not accept hazardous waste from
        off-site, non-DoD facilities without written permission from HQ ACC/CEV. In addition, off-site,
        non-DoD waste should only be accepted if it is the direct or indirect result of a DoD mission (i.e.,
        munitions manufacture for DoD). Waste disposal support of this nature must be clearly defined in
        a MOA or MOU between the waste generating activity and the installation. This requirement does
        not apply to EOD support to the local community in dealing with explosives emergencies.
        2.3.8.3. Management of HW for Deployed ACC Units:
            2.3.8.3.1. When ACC units prepare for deployment they should also consider the needs for
            HW management at the deployed location. See Air Force Handbook 10-222, Volume 4, Envi-
            ronmental Guide for Contingency Operations, for a discussion of environmental issues in gen-
            eral. Management of hazardous waste depends on the location of the deployment. If a unit
            deploys to another CONUS military installation, any waste generated would become part of
            the overall waste stream of that installation. Assuming the installation is a Large Quantity
            Generator (LQG), any hazardous waste generated by the deployed unit would have to be
            turned in to the facility's 90-day accumulation point or TSD. The only alternative would be to
            manifest the waste and ship it off site to a permitted TSD. DoD Directive 6050.16 and the
            Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD), Oct 92, require units to
            include an environmental annex in their deployment plans. The specifications for this annex
            are outlined in JCS Publication 4-04, Joint Doctrine for Civil Engineering Support. Many
            countries to which ACC units deploy will have a Final Governing Standard (FGS) which is
            published by the service designated as the executive agent for that country. The FGS provides
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        39


       country-specific substantive provisions, typically technical limitations on discharge or envi-
       ronmental management practices with which installations must comply. On rare occasions, an
       ACC unit may deploy to a contingency base in a country without a FGS. In these cases, the
       OPLAN should control, as described below, until the base is established (as determined by the
       executive agent). ACC units will prepare environmental annexes to their deployment plans.
       For those units deployed to locations without a published Final Governing Standards comply
       with relevant provisions of the OPLAN. The OEBGD typically does not apply to contingency
       operations.
       2.3.8.3.2. Suggested items to be included in a HW deployment kit are:
           2.3.8.3.2.1. A HW collection drum sufficient to collect potential waste generation for
           approximately three weeks.
           2.3.8.3.2.2. A spill kit sufficiently sized to handle small releases. The kit should include
           absorbent pads, booms, non-sparking shovels, and protective personnel equipment.
       2.3.8.3.3. Suggested actions to take to prepare for a deployment are summarized in Attach-
       ment 19.
       2.3.8.3.4. The manager responsible for HW for the deployed unit should consider the types
       and quantities of expected HW generation when preparing the deployment HW kit. Size the
       kit materials sufficiently to sustain the units operations for approximately three weeks. Once
       the unit arrives on station the manager responsible for HW should immediately seek out HW
       disposal procedures at the deployed location.
       2.3.8.3.5. The installation hazardous waste manager should be available to provide technical
       support to the deploying unit's environmental POC. If requested, technical support should
       include written procedures for hazardous waste management at the deployed location. Each
       situation will be different, based on several factors: the length of the deployment; quantity and
       type of waste generated by the deployed unit; status of the deployed location; LQG; SQG;
       CESQG; no waste generated; and CONUS versus OCONUS.
       2.3.8.3.6. All location and mission specific factors must be addressed before any guidance can
       be disseminated. Additional technical support is available through HQ ACC/CEVQ.
    2.3.8.4. Host/Tenant Reimbursement. Tenants will reimburse host bases for disposal of their
    hazardous waste if the waste volume presents an undue burden on the host base. The Air Force
    Audit Agency has defined an undue burden as $125 per quarter, based on FM policies.
    2.3.8.5. Inspection Reimbursement. As per interagency agreement between the Air Force and
    the EPA, each installation is responsible for reimbursing the state for RCRA inspections of permit-
    ted TSDs. By 1 Sep of each fiscal year, each installation will contact its respective EPA region to
    establish a ceiling for inspection costs for the subsequent year. A reimbursable MIPR will be pre-
    pared in the agreed upon amount and will be maintained by each installation. The EPA will notify
    the installation of any de-obligation amounts by 1 Sep of the fiscal year for which the funds on the
    MIPR are obligated. The EPA will then reimburse the states for their efforts.
    2.3.8.6. Lead. Lead is a serious environmental contaminant. In addition to solid lead and lead
    alloys, lead is commonly found in many sealants, lubricants, paints and other products. Most lead
    and lead products would be considered toxicity characteristic hazardous wastes, and cannot be dis-
    posed in the trash. Elemental lead, and various lead alloys from various shops may be considered
40                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        scrap metal and be exempt from most RCRA regulations provided it is collected and recycled (see
        40 CFR Part 261.4 (3)(ii)). The excess material should be collected in an appropriate container
        and recycled through DRMO.
        2.3.8.7. Depleted Uranium (DU). DU is used by the military because of its extraordinary effec-
        tiveness in anti-armor munitions, as well as protective armor in Army tanks. DU is considered
        low-level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) and the Air Force DU program is managed by AFIERA/
        SDRH at Brooks AFB, TX. While DU is considered a heavy metal, as are nickel and lead, its mil-
        itary use has not been linked to health problems. Consult AFIERA/SDRH for guidelines to follow
        in collecting and consolidating excess radioactive material in preparation for removal off-installa-
        tion (See Army Pamphlet 11-9 for additional valuable information). To have mixed waste condi-
        tionally-exempted from RCRA HW management requirements, an installation would need to
        meet all of the conditions proposed to be codified at 40 CFR 266.230.
     2.3.9. Munitions Management:
        2.3.9.1. With few exceptions, the Air Force munitions POC at Hill AFB directs all base level
        munitions personnel to ship excess munitions to the Army for further evaluation and final disposi-
        tion. This is in keeping with current Air Force and ACC policy. Holloman AFB maintains a Sub-
        part X permit for munitions treatment. All other ACC installations have or will initiate actions to
        close their OB/OD site. The goal is to minimize the regulatory liability posed by OB/OD sites.
        Should the Army refuse to accept an installation's munitions, contact HQ ACC/CEVQ for assis-
        tance and the latest guidance on munitions disposal.
        2.3.9.2. Under the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992, EPA, in conjunction with the Depart-
        ment of Defense, was required to publish a rule which defines when military munitions are subject
        to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Published on 12 Feb 1997, the final
        Military Munitions Rule (MMR) is considerably different than the proposed rule, and represents a
        significant departure from traditional RCRA thinking. The federal regulations took effect on 12
        Aug 1997, but since many of the requirements are considered less stringent than existing regula-
        tions the states are under no obligation to adopt the requirements as written. MMR requirements
        will only be in effect in the states when adopted through each state's legislative process. However,
        the status of the MMR in each state does not change the way excess munitions will be managed.
        The Army has an excellent program for recycling munitions, and shipment for further evaluation
        is in keeping with traditional RCRA requirements. Regardless of the status of the munitions rule
        in each state, ship excess munitions to the Army for evaluation and final disposition.
        2.3.9.3. There are six major issues addressed in the final rule:
           2.3.9.3.1. When an unused munition becomes a RCRA hazardous waste.
           2.3.9.3.2. Applicability of RCRA hazardous waste management standards to munitions used
           in military training exercises or weapons testing.
           2.3.9.3.3. How RCRA regulations apply to emergencies involving military and non-military
           explosives.
           2.3.9.3.4. In what way RCRA regulations apply to unexploded ordnance (UXO) at military
           ranges.
           2.3.9.3.5. Once deemed a hazardous waste, the storage, generation, and transportation stan-
           dards needed for munitions.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           41


       2.3.9.3.6. Revision of the definition of on-site to reflect contiguous facilities bisected by pub-
       lic right-of-ways.
    2.3.9.4. Under this rule, munitions become solid waste in four situations:
       2.3.9.4.1. Munitions that have been or are abandoned by being disposed of, burned, or other-
       wise treated prior to disposal (40 CFR Part 266.202(b)(1)). This covers munitions that have
       been disposed of in the past. In other words all munitions that were removed from storage and
       disposed of through on-site open burn/open detonation (OB/OD), or other on-site or off-site
       disposal methods are considered solid waste. This would include any munitions that were
       treated (OB/OD or other method) and buried on or off site in the past.
       2.3.9.4.2. Munitions removed from storage for the purposes of treatment or disposal (40 CFR
       Part 266.202(b)(2)). Munitions removed from storage for the purposes of disposal, burning,
       incineration, or other destruction or treatment prior to disposal are solid waste. Munitions in
       storage are unused material not subject to RCRA requirement. EPA has determined that the
       options available to DoD for reuse, reconditioning, and sale of excess munitions makes it very
       difficult to establish exactly when a munition becomes a solid waste. Simply identifying a
       munition as excess or unserviceable does not necessarily indicate the intent to dispose. This
       issue is often referred to as the "igloo door rule" and represents a compromise between DoD
       and EPA. Even if a base has an on site OB/OD site and the intent to dispose is clear, the item
       is not considered a solid waste until removed from the storage bunker for disposal.
       2.3.9.4.3. Leaking or Deteriorated Munitions (40 CFR Part 266.202(b)(3)). Although most
       munitions in storage are not considered solid waste, there are certain instances when an unused
       munition could be declared a solid waste. If a munition is deteriorated to a point that it is no
       longer useful for its intended purpose, and there is no potential for reuse or recycling, it is con-
       sidered a solid waste and potentially subject to all the requirements of RCRA.
       2.3.9.4.4. Munitions determined by DoD to be a solid waste (40 CFR Part 266.202(b)(4)). If
       an "authorized military official" (AMO) declares a particular stockpiled munition to be a solid
       waste, it is then potentially subject to all the requirements of RCRA. For example, if DoD
       declares a specific stock class of munitions to be no longer of use to military operations, and
       that the munitions would not be recycled or sold (as in the case of some chemical munitions)
       those munitions would then become solid waste. DoD policy dictates that this responsibility
       does not lie at the base level, or even the MAJCOM or service level. Only DoD level AMOs
       can declare a munition to be waste.
       2.3.9.4.5. Most ACC installations will not be managing any unused excess or unserviceable
       munitions as solid waste unless they fall under the deteriorated category or are declared solid
       waste by DoD. As a result, ACC no longer disposes of unused munitions on site. All excess,
       unused munitions will be shipped to the Army for final disposition. As the DoD POC for all
       munitions issues, the Army will decide the fate of all munitions. The munitions demilitariza-
       tion office at Hill AFB directs almost all unused munitions be shipped to the Army. Expended
       or partially expended munitions will be discussed in a subsequent section of this guidance.
       2.3.9.4.6. Munitions are not considered a solid waste under RCRA when the use of a material
       for its intended purpose does not constitute waste management, even if the material is dis-
       charged to the land. Using this rationale, EPA states that use of munitions for their intended
42                               ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        purpose does not constitute waste disposal, and therefore is not subject to RCRA (40 CFR
        266.202(a)(1)). Specific examples are as follows:
            2.3.9.4.6.1. Munitions used in military training exercises. This includes training person-
            nel in the use of munitions and the proper destruction of excess propellant, and training
            EOD personnel to dispose of munitions.
            2.3.9.4.6.2. Munitions used in weapons testing. Munitions used in weapons research,
            development and testing are not subject to RCRA regulations.
            2.3.9.4.6.3. Munitions from range clearance operations. Range clearance activities are the
            direct result of weapons testing and training operations, and as such are not regulated
            under RCRA. Unregulated activities include collection of UXOs and other munitions
            scrap and the steps necessary to treat (i.e., OB/OD) those items to make them safe. How-
            ever, once treatment is complete and the scrap is removed from the range, all RCRA
            requirements are applicable. This includes disposal on-site or off-site. If the scrap metal
            is sent for recycling, the scrap metal exclusion may apply (40 CFR 261.6(3)(ii)). Range
            cleanup to be completed under the Environmental Restoration Program must be done
            through the base RPM and Restoration office.
            2.3.9.4.6.4. Munitions in Disassembly Operations. Munitions that are being repaired,
            reused, recycled, reclaimed, disassembled, reconfigured, or otherwise subjected to materi-
            als recovery activities are not solid wastes. It should be noted though that munitions that
            are already declared waste and being disassembled prior to disposal are subject to regula-
            tion.
     2.3.9.5. Emergency Response. The final munitions rule states that immediate responses to emer-
     gency situations involving military or non-military munitions do not require a RCRA permit.
     Response activities can include moving the explosive to a safer location for treatment. The deter-
     mination of whether an emergency situation exists is left up to the "explosives or munitions emer-
     gency response expert". For ACC purposes, an "expert" includes any person trained in
     identification, management and destruction of explosives or munitions, i.e., EOD and Technical
     Escort Unit (TEU) personnel (40 CFR 260.10).
     2.3.9.6. Application of RCRA to Range Operations. There are several different situations that
     dictate when RCRA regulations apply to range operations. As stated earlier, fired munitions used
     on a range (i.e., deposited on the land) during normal training and testing operations does not con-
     stitute disposal under RCRA, and therefore the expended munitions are not a solid waste. How-
     ever, RCRA regulations may apply under certain conditions.
        2.3.9.6.1. Non-Fired Munitions on Ranges and Used Munitions Moved Off Range. If
        unused munitions are or were disposed of on a range through burning, incineration, burial, or
        other disposal method, those munitions would be considered solid waste and potentially sub-
        ject to full RCRA regulation. This would also apply to any fired munitions or UXOs that are
        retrieved during a range clearance operation and made safe, usually through OB/OD. Once the
        munitions have been secured, RCRA regulations do apply to the disposal; whether on site or
        off (40 CFR Part 266.202(c)).
        2.3.9.6.2. Munitions That Land off Range. Any fired munitions that lands off-site must be
        promptly retrieved and rendered safe or be subject to RCRA regulations. A munition that
        lands off-site, is not retrieved, and is not considered to be re-used for its intended purpose, is
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                     43


       therefore considered a solid waste being disposed. All RCRA regulations would apply (40
       CFR Part 266.202(d)).
    2.3.9.7. The Applicability of RCRA to Generation, Transportation, and Storage:
       2.3.9.7.1. Background. EPA has developed an alternative to the strict application of RCRA
       Subtitle C regulations to storage and transportation of waste munitions. This is the "condi-
       tional exemption" alternative, under which waste military munitions that otherwise meet the
       definition of hazardous waste are not regulated as RCRA hazardous wastes provided they are
       managed in accordance with DoD standards (Final Military Munitions Rule, Federal Register,
       Vol. 62, No. 29, February 12, 1997, Preamble IV, L). As it pertains to military munitions,
       EPA's rationale is that DoD standards for the management of munitions are as protective of
       human health and the environment, or more so, than RCRA hazardous waste regulations. EPA
       believes that the DoD explosives safety board (DDESB) imposes adequate controls on muni-
       tions, and that imposing RCRA hazardous waste requirements would not raise the level of pro-
       tection to a higher level, but would rather be an unnecessary burden on DoD. Any facility or
       transporter that violates DDESB standards would not only be subject to any DoD level disci-
       plinary action, but would also now be subject to RCRA Subtitle C requirements.
       2.3.9.7.2. Generation and Transportation. Employing the "conditional exemption" con-
       cept, generation and transportation activities are conditionally exempt from the container
       marking, manifesting, and other requirements typically applicable to generators and transport-
       ers. (Remember, munitions are not considered a solid waste until removed from storage with
       the specific intent of disposal.) Of course DDESB standards must be strictly adhered to, and
       the exemption applies to generators and transporters of unused military munitions; including
       contract carriers transporting munitions under the control of the DDESB standards.
       2.3.9.7.3. Storage. EPA has established two alternatives for storage of waste munitions. The
       more conventional approach was to add Subpart EE to 40 CFR Part 264, and Part 265. Sub-
       part EE establishes storage standards for hazardous waste munitions, much of which are based
       on the DDESB standards. The new subpart addresses design, operation, monitoring, inspec-
       tion, closure, and post-closure care standards, consistent with RCRA requirements for other
       storage units. These standards would be incorporated into a part B permit just like any other
       TSD (Final Military Munitions Rule, Federal Register, Vol. 62, No. 29, February 12, 1997,
       Preamble IV, M, 1).
       2.3.9.7.4. Exemption. In contrast to permitted storage, EPA has applied the "conditional
       exemption" concept to waste munitions storage. EPA has proposed a conditional exemption
       from RCRA requirements for those waste military munitions that are managed in accordance
       with DDESB storage standards (Final Military Munitions Rule, Federal Register, Vol. 62, No.
       29, February 12, 1997, Preamble IV, M, 1). EPA interprets RCRA 1004(5)(B) to allow them
       to determine whether mismanagement is likely to occur and define a waste as hazardous only
       when mismanagement is likely to occur. EPA uses this interpretation to argue that storing
       waste munitions in accordance with DDESB standards is adequate to protect human health
       and the environment. If an installation generates a "hazardous waste" munition, and plans to
       use the conditional exemption, the state must be notified within 90 days (40 CFR
       266.205(a)(iv)).
44                               ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        2.3.9.7.5. Manifest Exemption in Lieu of "On Site" Redefinition. In the proposed rule,
        EPA discussed the possibility of redefining "on-site" to alleviate some of the burden for con-
        tiguous facilities bisected by a public highway. As written, RCRA regulations allow transpor-
        tation of hazardous waste without a manifest or authorized transporter only across public
        highways. The original idea was to redefine on-site to allow facilities to transport waste along
        public highways as well. This can be a problem for facilities that do not have entranceways
        facing each other across a public road. Upon further review by EPA it was determined that
        changing the definition of on-site could potentially create problems in other regulations that
        rely on the on-site definition. The alternative is to grant an exemption to facilities in this situ-
        ation. The change allows facilities to transport waste along a public highway without an EPA
        transporter ID number, and without a manifest (40 CFR 266.205(a)(iv)). This applies to all
        facilities and all types of hazardous waste. Of course this should not be misconstrued to mean
        waste can be moved from one facility to another; only contiguous facilities with one EPA ID
        number are eligible for this exemption.
     2.3.9.8. Specific Munitions Situations (This guidance is not intended to address every situation,
     but only some of the most common ones):
        2.3.9.8.1. Civilian Munitions. Conventional civilian munitions are commonly found on base
        in amnesty boxes, or are confiscated by base security forces. Examples include shotgun shells,
        aerial flares, and small caliber handgun and rifle ammunition. Found on base munitions
        should be turned into the base Munitions Storage Area for courtesy storage. If the item in
        question is comparable to a stock listed military munition, the item should be picked up on
        record by the MSA and an ammunition disposal request (ADR) processed through OO-ALC/
        LIW, Hill AFB. The Army has committed to processing these items even if they are not tech-
        nically stock listed military items. EOD and munitions inspection personnel should be able to
        determine if the item is comparable to a stock listed item. If the item in question is not com-
        parable to a military munition, it is the responsibility of the organization that found the item to
        coordinate an emergency disposal permit with the State through the base Civil Engineering
        Environmental Office. Ball type ammunition .50 caliber and smaller is not considered reactive
        by the EPA and should not be treated as a hazardous waste.
            2.3.9.8.1.1. Fireworks. Fireworks are often confiscated by base security forces and pose
            a unique disposal problem. They don't correspond to anything in the military inventory.
            Although relatively harmless compared to other munitions, they are still considered a reac-
            tive hazardous waste. The only realistic disposal alternative for fireworks is through a
            local or DRMO contract. Please contact HQ ACC/CEVQ for the latest information on dis-
            posal.
        2.3.9.8.2. Unique Military Items. Unique military items can include foreign military items
        or US military munitions that are no longer in the inventory. Foreign munitions that can be
        correlated to a US stock list number will be picked up on record by the MSA and an ammuni-
        tion disposal request (ADR) will be processed through OO-ALC/LIW, Hill AFB. Antique US
        military items are still considered military munitions and will be managed as such. ADR
        requirements apply.
            2.3.9.8.2.1. Ground Burst Simulators (GBSs), and Smoke Grenades. Unexploded
            GBSs and smoke grenades used on base during on-base Phase II Operational Readiness
            Exercises pose unique safety and disposal problems. Not unlike range clearance activities,
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           45


            the dud GBSs and grenades must be removed and treated for safety reasons. Within ACC
            this situation is treated comparable to range clearance, which is specifically exempt from
            RCRA regulation. ACC policy is to remove and treat the items as quickly as possible, but
            no later than one day after completion of the exercise.
        2.3.9.8.3. Emergencies. Munitions and explosive emergencies can fall into two categories.
        Those that represent a substantial threat and must be dealt with immediately (Level 1), and
        those that are a substantial threat, but do not necessarily require an immediate response (Level
        2).
            2.3.9.8.3.1. Immediate Response. EOD personnel have the authority to determine when
            an emergency warrants immediate response, (i.e., destruction, or removal to a safer loca-
            tion for destruction). This activity does not require a permit, but may require after-the-fact
            notification to the state depending on state requirements.
            2.3.9.8.3.2. Non-immediate Response. EOD can also determine that an emergency may
            exist, but that immediate response is not warranted. In this case it may be necessary to
            notify the state and request an emergency permit. Most states will issue a verbal authori-
            zation with a follow up written permit of one to five pages. States vary however, and it is
            important to become familiar with the requirements in your state. The emergency permit
            should not be relied upon as a method of treating munitions on a regular basis. An exam-
            ple of a non-immediate response would be treating the munitions that are recovered from
            an aircraft crash. They are typically retained until the crash investigation is over, but can't
            be certified safe to ship. An emergency permit is the only option for an installation that
            does not have a permitted thermal treatment unit (TTU).
  2.3.10. Small Arms Range (SAR) Management:
     2.3.10.1. Handling Hazardous Waste. The hazardous waste process for active small arms
     ranges is an important area environmental compliance managers should understand. In order for a
     material to be regulated under RCRA, it must first be defined as a solid waste and then a hazardous
     waste. For a material to qualify as a solid waste, it must first be discarded. Discarded material is
     any material that is abandoned, recycled, or considered inherently waste-like. Materials are solid
     waste if they are abandoned by being disposed of, burned, or incinerated, or accumulated, stored,
     or treated before or instead of being abandoned. The Munitions Rule clearly states that munitions
     used for their intended purpose are not solid waste. Lead at active small arms ranges is not subject
     to regulation.
     2.3.10.2. Description of the Regulatory Process. The munitions rule clearly states that a mili-
     tary munition used for its intended purpose is not a solid waste, and therefore not a hazardous
     waste, even though use includes discharge to the land. EPA states that this is analogous to spray-
     ing pesticides. Certain pesticides could be a hazardous waste upon disposal, but are not waste
     when spread on the land for their intended purpose (i.e., to control pests or noxious weeds). For
     munitions, "intended purpose" includes personnel training weapons testing. Small arms ranges
     clearly fall into this category.
     2.3.10.3. Applicability of RCRA Requirements to Maintenance of Small Arms Ranges:
        2.3.10.3.1. For safety and operational reasons small arms ranges require periodic maintenance
        to prevent a buildup of excess bullets in the firing berm. Excess bullets in the berm can lead to
        safety concerns due to ricochets. Maintenance of the SAR may include removal of scrap metal

            and possibly the soil. Typically maintenance of the berm will included sifting out the lead
            scrap for disposal or recycling. The original soil should be returned back to the berm if at all
            possible. If the soil can no longer be used in the berm, it must be sampled for the presence of
            lead, and will likely require management as a hazardous waste.
            2.3.10.3.2. Soil maintained within the berm is not subject to regulation because the soil is not
            being disposed of. If the soil remains in active use, it does not qualify as a hazardous waste.
            Analysis of the soil is not required because the soil is being returned for active use and is not
            being discarded. RCRA requires hazardous waste determinations only for materials that qual-
            ify as solid wastes (40 CFR 262.11). Bases should elect to use this option if achievable to min-
            imize hazardous waste disposal requirements. In addition, the lead bullets can be managed
            under the scrap metal exclusion (40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii)).
        2.3.10.4. The Scrap Metal Exclusion. As stated in the previous section, bullet fragments can be
        collected and sold as scrap metal for recycling under a DRMO recycling contract. Recycling of
        scrap metal is excluded from certain parts of the regulation per the scrap metal exclusion in 40
        CFR 261.6(a)(3)(iii). Technically the spent bullet fragments qualify as hazardous wastes because
        of their metal content; but bases are encouraged to take advantage of this exclusion by recycling
        the bullet fragments, thereby relieving themselves of onerous regulatory requirements imposed
        upon those who choose not to recycle.
        2.3.10.5. When a SAR is out of Compliance:
            2.3.10.5.1. An active range can fall out of environmental compliance because of a number of
            activities associated with range maintenance. This section is limited to compliance of ranges
            in normal day-to-day activities of firing of small arms ammunition and does not include the
            implications of maintenance activities discussed earlier.
            2.3.10.5.2. Any attempt to address a SAR under the RCRA corrective actions program must
            be coordinated with HQ ACC/CEV. Note that funding validation must be obtained from HQ
            ACC/CEVQ prior to making any commitment with the appropriate regulatory agency. Details
            on the required justifications for funding are discussed in the following section.
        2.3.10.6. Small Arms Range Closure. Closure of a small arms range may require a base to ana-
        lyze the berm for hazardous waste constituents. Future site cleanup and closure under the Envi-
        ronmental Restoration Program must be done through the base RPM and will be done in
        accordance with the procedures and policies of the latest ACC IRP RPM Guidebook.
        2.3.10.7. Frangible Bullets. Frangible bullets ("Green Bullets") are made of various alloys that
        do not include lead or other toxic metals, and disintegrate on impact. Use of frangible bullets for
        small arms training should be encouraged.
     2.3.11. Defense Reutilization Management Office (DRMO) Utilization. DRMO is the preferred
     hazardous waste disposal agent for ACC installations. However, installation commanders may use
     other disposal agents outside of DRMO if the commander decides it is in the best interest of the Air
     Force and HQ ACC/CE concurs. Installations wishing to use other than DRMO for the disposal of
     their hazardous waste must prepare a proposal for ACC/CE approval before contracting activities pro-
     ceed.
        2.3.11.1. The proposal to circumvent DRMO must include the following:
            2.3.11.1.1. A discussion of the rationale for severing the relationship with DRMO.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          47


       2.3.11.1.2. A comparison of the disposal costs between DRMO and a local contract. Include
       actual waste disposal costs, as well as man-hours to oversee the contract.
       2.3.11.1.3. A comparison and discussion on potential government liability under a local con-
       tract verses existing liability using DRMO contracts.
       2.3.11.1.4. A discussion of the qualification and experience of available contractors.
       2.3.11.1.5. A "back-up" plan on how waste will be managed should the chosen contractor fail
       to provide adequate service.
    2.3.11.2. Hazardous waste disposal contracts and recycling requirements must:
       2.3.11.2.1. Be at least as stringent as DRMO requirements.
       2.3.11.2.2. Honor existing contracts written by the DRMO.
       2.3.11.2.3. Follow ACC contracting practices and procedures.
    2.3.11.3. Inspections of Contractor Facilities. Prior to contract award, inspect the proposed
    treatment or disposal site and verify the facility is authorized to handle the base's wastes. Evaluate
    all proposed hazardous waste transport contractors the same way. Conduct on-site "no notice" fol-
    low-up verification audits for all hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities receiving Air
    Force hazardous waste. Carry out inspections annually to verify proper "cradle-to-grave" waste
    handling and disposal. Keep and maintain adequate files and records of all inspections, visits,
    communications, contractual documents, correspondence, and pertinent records to demonstrate to
    regulators, ECAMP assessors, auditors, and other official agency the installations full compliance
    with all aspects of hazardous waste disposal and treatment.

                                                Chapter 3

      RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT STORAGE TANK PROGRAM

3.1. General Requirements.
     3.1.1. Responsibilities:
        3.1.1.1. The MAJCOM is responsible for overall Command Underground Storage Tank (UST)
        program policy and oversight. Headquarters ACC/CEVQ coordinates with other MAJCOMs and
        HQ USAF/ILEV to cross-feed and standardize UST standards and compliance. ACC/CEVQ pro-
        vides guidance to ensure compliance with all applicable state, federal, and UST regulations and
        validates requirements requests by installations environmental flights.
        3.1.1.2. The base environmental function is responsible for monitoring all POL activities. The
        environmental flight ensures UST regulation standards are complied for the installation and pro-
        poses actions to maintain compliance. The Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures
        (SPCC) plan is reviewed by the installation UST program manager to ensure it accurately reflects
        the USTs on the base. Changes in SPCC rules in July 2002 will require a thorough review of exist-
        ing SPCC plans. The UST program manager reconciles the UST base list with the regulatory
        agency responsible for UST oversight.
     3.1.2. Policy Guidance. This chapter implements the requirements for storage tank management as
     contained in AFI 32-7044, Storage Tank Compliance. For underground storage tanks (USTs), refer to
     40 CFR 280. Federal standards for above ground storage tanks (ASTs) have not been developed.
     3.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
     requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
     provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
     sound engineering and/or environmental practices that maintain environmental compliance.
     3.1.4. Applicability:
        3.1.4.1. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations, ANG, and
        AFRES units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing commander.
        Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordination
        with the host installation.
        3.1.4.2. This guidance does not apply to ACC installations located in foreign countries. For envi-
        ronmental compliance at ACC OCONUS installations and operations, use the more stringent of
        the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), Treaty, DoD Instructions, or Final Governing
        Standards (FGS). If there are local or host nation regulations not covered by these documents,
        then the base shall request HQ ACC/CEV conduct a case-by-case determination.

3.2. Permits. USTs typically do not have permits, but are "registered" or licensed to operate by the state
in which the installation resides. Records for each tank include information on corrosion potential, com-
pliance with release detection requirements, repairs, and closure procedures at minimum. See Table 3.1.
for a more detailed list of UST record documentation.

3.3. Underground Storage Tanks. In September 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
published its UST regulations establishing a nationwide "cradle to grave" management program for USTs.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          49


Federal agencies are required to comply with the federal UST regulations as well as state UST regulations
that may be more stringent. UST regulations are detailed in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) Parts 280 and 281. Where practical to do so, ACC installations should eliminate USTs.
   3.3.1. Regulated Underground Storage Tanks.
       3.3.1.1. Definition. A UST is defined as any tank containing a petroleum product or hazardous
       substance with 10 percent of its volume and the volume of associated piping located below the
       ground surface. In defining USTs, EPA has exempted, excluded, or deferred various types of
       USTs in 40 CFR 280.10. Items of particular interest are listed below, the full definition of a UST,
       including which are exempt, excluded or deferred, is found in 40 CFR 280.12.
           3.3.1.1.1. Regulated USTs are those that are not exempt, excluded, or deferred as defined
           below.
           3.3.1.1.2. Non-regulated USTs are those that are exempt, excluded, or deferred as defined
           below.
       3.3.1.2. Exempt USTs. The following USTs are exempt under the definition of an UST (40 CFR
       280.12, Definitions):
           3.3.1.2.1. Storage tanks situated in an underground area such as a basement or cellar.
           3.3.1.2.2. Heating oil tanks for use on the premises.
       3.3.1.3. Excluded USTs. The following USTs are excluded under 40 CFR 280.10(b), Applicabil-
       ity:
           3.3.1.3.1. USTs smaller than 110 gallons in capacity.
           3.3.1.3.2. Emergency spill or overflow containment USTs.
           3.3.1.3.3. UST systems holding regulated hazardous wastes.
       3.3.1.4. Deferrals. Tanks that are deferred rather than excluded are subject to interim UST
       requirements for cathodic protection, 40 CFR 280.11.
           3.3.1.4.1. Wastewater Treatment Tanks. Oil/water separators are included in this category;
           however, the associated holding tanks (if greater than 110 gallons) are regulated tanks and
           must meet all UST requirements. Some states, such as Texas, regulate OWS as USTs. You
           must verify your state's interpretation.
           3.3.1.4.2. Airport hydrant fuel systems include the following components: bulk fuel storage
           tanks, operating tanks, pump station, hydrant loop, hydrant outlet pits, product recovery tank,
           and all other associated piping. Under phase II of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Plan
           for Integrated Management of Bulk Petroleum, DLA/DESC (Defense Energy Supply Center)
           will assume responsibility for these systems. Airport hydrant fuel systems in California, Flor-
           ida, New York, and Texas are not deferred.
           3.3.1.4.3. Although EPA exempts airport hydrant fuel systems from regulation; ACC will
           conduct biennial leak monitoring (every two years) to be funded by DESC. New systems
           should have secondary containment. USTs used to store fuel for emergency power generators
           do not have to meet the release detection requirements. They do have to meet all other require-
           ments.
50                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


     3.3.2. Tank Upgrade/Replacement Policy. All ACC regulated USTs should now be upgraded. Any
     USTs found that are not compliance with the upgrade requirements of 40 CFR 280.21 must be
     addressed immediately. They will be temporarily closed in accordance with 40 CFR 280.70. Where
     possible, USTs should be replaced with ASTs or ASTs in underground vaults that provide secondary
     containment. These strategies should also be applied to other underground tanks (non-regulated
     tanks, such as heating oil tanks) not covered by federal or local regulations. The policies concerning
     new tank installations and replacement of existing tanks apply to both regulated USTs and other
     non-regulated underground tanks.
        3.3.2.1. DESC funding may be available for maintenance and repair of existing USTs that contain
        DESC owned fuel. Facility upgrades to comply with environmental, safety, fire protection, and
        electrical codes may be classified as repair.
        3.3.2.2. ACC Standards. Environmental projects must meet all base and ACC design standards.
        All repairs must be completed in accordance with MIL-HDBK-1022A, Petroleum Fuel Facilities,
        and Air Force design standards.
        3.3.2.3. USTs at Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) sites require unique planning and
        design considerations to ensure they meet specific hardness criteria, and provide strict configura-
        tion control from site to site. The ACC CES/ESM UST design will be used.
        3.3.2.4. When USTs are installed, the base must notify the state authority within thirty days and
        certify that the tank and piping are installed properly according to industry codes. The base must
        also certify that the UST system has release detection and, if of steel construction, cathodic protec-
        tion. USTs must be installed with devices that prevent spills and overfilling of USTs during trans-
        fer operations.
     3.3.3. Requirements for Installation and Replacement of Storage Tanks:
        3.3.3.1. The ACC preference for storage tanks is aboveground systems.
        3.3.3.2. The installation commander is delegated the authority to approve the type of storage tank
        to be installed at their base. This authority cannot be re-delegated. All users and tenants on ACC
        bases must comply with this policy.
            3.3.3.2.1. The CE squadron commander should provide the installation commander the fol-
            lowing information to assist the decision-making process, by analyzing the pros and cons of
            each storage system. For example:
                3.3.3.2.1.1. Utilize the Storage Tank Analysis Tool (STAT) to determine life cycle cost.
                3.3.3.2.1.2. Determine potential for enforcement vulnerability and other environmental
                concerns.
                3.3.3.2.1.3. Ensure architectural compatibility standards are met.
                3.3.3.2.1.4. Recognize the additional requirements required when dealing with confined
                space including safety issues.
        3.3.3.3. Underground installation should be considered when tanks are required in the runway
        clear zone, weapons storage areas, on the flight line, and in areas of high force protection concern
        (e.g., tanks installed next to a command post).
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         51


         3.3.3.3.1. All USTs must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 280/281, and state and local envi-
         ronmental regulations. MIL-HDBK-1022A should be used as guidance for design and con-
         struction.
         3.3.3.3.2. The user will also be responsible to fund, as part of the project, secondary contain-
         ment using the more stringent of 40 CFR 112.7, or applicable state regulations.
         3.3.3.3.3. Funding. Only 40 CFR 280 requirements are EC eligible according to the USAF
         funding matrix. O&M repair and maintenance is not EC eligible.
  3.3.4. Leak Detection Policy.
     3.3.4.1. All regulated USTs require leak detection in accordance with 40 CFR 280.40.
     3.3.4.2. Leak detection on non-regulated tanks and piping is not required by federal regulation.
     ACC will not fund testing for non-regulated tanks.
     3.3.4.3. For tanks that do not have built in leak detection systems, ACC uses TRACER® leak
     detection and monitoring systems, a proprietary soil vapor extraction system that detects both
     hydrocarbon concentrations as well as volatile gas introduced to the tank on a periodic basis.
     ACC policy is to conduct one precision leak test annually for all regulated tanks/piping and pres-
     surized piping systems followed by monthly monitoring of all regulated USTs. The precision test
     consists of taking samples from individual probes 14 to 21 days after the tanks have been inocu-
     lated with tracer gas. Monthly monitoring consists of taking composite samples (two to four
     probes per sample) for analysis of tracer gas and/or elevated hydrocarbon concentrations between
     inoculations.
     3.3.4.4. The leak detection contract is provided through DESC. ACC bases provide their annual
     requirements by DD Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data, in the DESC annual call
     in November of each year for the next fiscal year. HQ ACC/CEVQ transfers ACC funding for
     leak detection requirements to DESC for execution for all bases.
     3.3.4.5. Hydrant piping systems are deferred from federal regulation and do not require leak
     detection except where required by state regulations. DESC will fund leak detection of these sys-
     tems where state or locally regulated. DESC will also fund periodic, currently every other year,
     testing of non-regulated systems as a good management practice. Hydrant systems in sensitive
     ecosystems or that have a history of leaks may be eligible for annual testing. Type III hydrant
     refueling systems are equipped with an automatic monitoring system that should be operated and
     maintained in accordance with manufacturer's procedures.
     3.3.4.6. Any precision leak test which results in an intermittent or significant leak rate will be
     reported to the implementing agency as a confirmed leak as detailed in 40 CFR 280 Subpart F (see
     paragraph 3.3.5.) Any monthly monitoring report indicating a leak will be reported as a suspected
     leak and will be confirmed within 7 days by either excavation or emergency sampling of individ-
     ual probes. HQ ACC/CEV must receive a spill report once leak is confirmed. Spill reporting is
     completed via ACC's spill reporting web page at http://www.cevp.com/spill.
  3.3.5. Release Reporting and Cleanup.
     3.3.5.1. The UST rules include specific release reporting and cleanup procedures in accordance
     with 40 CFR 280.50 Petroleum spills in excess of 25 gallons or those that cause a sheen on surface
     waters and suspected UST system leaks must be reported to the state regulator within 24 hours
52                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)7139, Environmental Release Report). Once a UST system leak is sus-
        pected, the base has seven days to investigate and confirm whether the tank or piping leaks. All
        spills and releases of any size must be cleaned up. If spills less than 25 gallons cannot be cleaned
        up within 24 hours, they also must be reported. Releases must be reported to headquarters using
        the ACC spill reporting web page at http://www.cevp.com/spill.
        3.3.5.2. When a UST system leak is confirmed, the installation must take immediate action
        towards remediation: stop, contain, report, and clean up the contamination. The base Spill Pre-
        vention and Response Plan should assign responsibilities and outline emergency response and
        cleanup actions to be taken. Where remediation is beyond the capabilities of the in-house work
        force, contract support must be secured immediately using existing funds. These releases cannot
        be handled as routine projects.
        3.3.5.3. DESC will fund the cost to identify, assess, repair and remediate fuel spills and leaks of
        fuel from USTs and associated piping under their control. Units will report such requirements
        with cost estimate and situation report to HQ ACC/CEVQM, who will in turn work with the
        DESC environmental section to secure funds. Immediate notification should also be provided to
        ACC/CEOI.
           3.3.5.3.1. Environmental compliance funds can be used to identify access, and remediate fuel
           spills and leaks of fuel from USTs and associated piping for systems that are also EC eligible.
           Units must input an emergency project in ACES-PM and notify the HQ ACC/CEVQ resources
           manager to facilitate timely funding.
        3.3.5.4. The California State Water Resources Control Board commissioned a study by Lawrence
        Livermore National Laboratory, "Recommendations to Improve the Cleanup Process for Califor-
        nia's Leaking Underground Fuel Tanks", 16 Oct 95. The study found that the impacts to the envi-
        ronment from leaking USTs were not as severe as once thought. The report presents a convincing
        argument that passive bioremediation should be considered as the primary remediation tool in
        most cases once the fuel leak source has been removed. This is a significant report and as Califor-
        nia is a leader in stringent environmental regulations, this could be a break through in UST reme-
        diation. This report should be mentioned to your state regulators as a cornerstone of your
        remediation plans associated with UST closure and other petroleum spills. One copy of this report
        was sent to each ACC base.
     3.3.6. Closure Requirements.
        3.3.6.1. Closure requirements are outlined in 40 CFR 280.70. All USTs must be closed within12
        months of being taken out of service.
     3.3.7. UST Management Records.
        3.3.7.1. Good UST records are needed for two reasons. First, they can help protect the Air Force
        from liability for other parties' contamination near Air Force installations. Second, good UST
        records provide the history necessary for sound management decisions.
        3.3.7.2. The UST records identified below are required by 40 CFR 280; optional records are iden-
        tified as such. Minimum time periods for maintaining records are also included. Local Imple-
        menting Agencies may require longer time periods for holding certain records.
        3.3.7.3. UST records must contain the following information (Table 3.1.):
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          53

          3.3.7.4.1. A completed UST inventory form including: tank size, contents, regulated status,
          age, and any identified requirements for leak detection, cathodic protection, and spill/overfill
          protection. The inventory form should be reviewed and updated annually or when a change to
          the UST system is made.
          3.3.7.4.2. History of products stored.
      3.3.7.5. A map showing the location of all UST systems should also be maintained as part of the
      installation UST management records. If a tab from the base comprehensive plan covers this
      requirement and is current, it should be used.
      3.3.7.6. Results of UST inspections by EPA, Inspector General, or Environmental Compliance
      Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) teams should be retained as part of the UST
      management records.
   3.3.8. UST Management Plans.
      3.3.8.1. Each installation should annually review the base UST Management Plan. The plan shall
      verify the complement of underground storage tanks (regulated and non-regulated), the user,
      materials in use, and procedures required to satisfy regulatory requirements for continued use.
      The plan shall also be designed to identify management responsibilities among various depart-
      ments and personnel, to include DESC owned and managed USTs. This management plan is

        intended for base use and should be maintained with in-house assets. As a minimum, the plan
        shall include the following provisions:
            3.3.8.1.1. A summary of state and federal UST requirements.
            3.3.8.1.2. A copy of this policy and other Air Force UST guidance.
            3.3.8.1.3. Spill/leak response actions and responsibilities (or reference to appropriate section
            of Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan).
            3.3.8.1.4. An inventory of all underground tanks, their current service status and contents,
            regulatory status, age, leak testing frequency, and inventory of ancillary equipment (spill pro-
            tection, overfill prevention, cathodic protection, and leak detection equipment).
            3.3.8.1.5. An ECP Funding Schedule showing all known requirements.
     3.3.9. Programming UST Work. UST program managers work with civil engineering liquid fuels
     maintenance, and logistics fuels personnel to develop a comprehensive requirements identification list
     for UST work. Projects identified are programmed through the base level facility project program
     maintained by the engineering flight. The UST program manager ensures all ECP eligible are input
     into HQ ACC/CEVQ via the ACES-PM database management system. Work should be programmed
     as far in as advance as possible, but no later than 2 years in advance of need, to ensure adequate fund-
     ing. The following table is a list of references to be used for USTs (Table 3.2.):

   3.3.10. Funding UST Work.
      3.3.10.1. Specific information is necessary when developing the narrative for UST ACES-PM
      inputs and for project DD Form 1391s. The information should clearly explain what the project is
      for, what is being done, how and why it is being done and what the regulatory driver is. Narratives
      for a typical UST upgrade or removal replacement should include the number, size, and locations
      (building numbers) of the tanks being addressed. Explain if the tank is being upgraded or
      removed and why (i.e., the tank is no longer in use and must be closed according to state UST clo-
      sure requirements). If the project includes a site characterization or UST remediation, include the
      area to be looked at, how many samples are expected, how much soil is to be removed and how the
      soil is will be disposed. The Air Force has authorized the use of appropriated funds for environ-
      mental liability/cleanup, maintenance and repair, and repair by replacement to support AAFES
      USTs installed after 30 Sep 88. AAFES Non-appropriated funds are required for permit fees and
      monitoring devices (REF: ACC/CE memorandum, 20 Jul 01, Air Force Funding Policy Change
      for Army and Air Force Exchange Service Station Underground Storage Tanks). See Chapter 15
      for more detailed funding eligibility.
      3.3.10.2. Several funding sources are available for UST projects.
          3.3.10.2.1. O&M Environmental Compliance Program (ECP) Funding. ECP funding
          should be requested where leaks from active UST systems require remediation and are ineligi-
          ble for ERA funding. A UST remediation project is classified a Level I ECP requirement
          when requesting funds in the year cleanup is required. HQ USAF/ILE issued guidance that
          repairs to infrastructure are not eligible for ECP funds and should be programmed in the Real
          Property Maintenance (RPM) program.
   3.3.11. Funding for USTs Containing DESC Owned Fuel. DESC assumed funding responsibility
   for Military Construction, Maintenance and Repair, Minor Construction and Environmental Protec-
   tion programs on all fixed fuel facilities that store and disperse DLA owned fuel. This excludes facil-
   ities (USTs) where the Air Force owns the fuel and the tanks are supporting a single customer account
   such as heating plants and Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE). DESC has sole responsibility and
   authority to approve, execute, accept or reject projects funded through DESC.
      3.3.11.1. Requests for DESC funded proposed engineering projects are forwarded via HQ ACC/
      CEP to DESC-FE usually by 1 Feb for the upcoming fiscal year program. Documentation for
      each project should include at minimum a DD Form 1391, cost estimate detailed enough to pro-
      vide a breakdown of work types, and may include photos, video tapes, or previous studies that
      would be helpful in explaining the project scope and urgency of requirements. Once projects have
      been reviewed and approved by DESC the base will be responsible for providing an estimated
      design start and completion dates upon requesting design funds and construction start. DESC pri-
      orities for approved projects are available on the DESC home page at http://www.desc.dla.mil/.
   3.3.12. Lessons Learned.
56                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        3.3.12.1. Tank custodian training is provided by the Base Fuels Management Flights and covers
        both above and underground tanks. AFI 23-204, Organizational Fuel Tanks, covers not only tank
        custodian training requirements but also procedures/custodian responsibilities.
        3.3.12.2. A recent fuel spill was caused by new high level overfill alarms and liquid meter gauges,
        installed by the tank contractor, that failed to operate properly. HQ ACC/CEO requires the entire
        system be tested with fuel, according to ACC standard specifications and plans. This means test-
        ing the actual linkage on the ball by filling the tank with fuel and ensuring that the system works
        as a unit. Using the manual tester available on most float type high level cut off valves is not an
        acceptable testing method as it does not test the entire system including all the hydraulic tubing,
        valve operation, and float linkage mechanism. About five years ago ACC had a similar problem
        with a shop putting the wrong ball on the USTs float - one which would never raise on fuel the
        result was the tank overfilled. Ensure that base engineering contract specs have the requirement.

3.4. Aboveground Storage Tanks (ASTs). (NOTE: All vaulted storage tanks are considered ASTs).
     3.4.1. Federal AST Regulations. ACC installations will use MIL-HDBK-1022A as guidance for the
     design and construction of ASTs. The following five regulations dictate AST compliance minimum
     requirements:
        3.4.1.1. CWA, 40 CFR 112, Oil Pollution Prevention. Spill containment is required in accor-
        dance with the provisions of the Act. HQ USAF/ILEVQ has directed the most cost effective ade-
        quate spill containment be used. An engineering evaluation must be preformed to determine the
        most cost effective and adequate spill containment system for the site conditions. 40 CFR 112
        does apply to fuel trucks on an installation. However, secondary containment is not mandatory.
        Rather, the potential for discharge from the transfer of fuel must be addressed in the SPCC plan
        along with a discussion of "appropriate containment" measures. It is critical that the SPCC plan
        include the potential for discharge and how such discharge will be controlled. This may, or may
        not, include secondary containment. If secondary containment is not used, the SPCC plan must
        describe methods to be taken to prevent a spill from reaching a navigable waterway as required by
        40 CFR 112.7c.
        3.4.1.2. Clean Air Act, 40 CFR 264 and 265 for air emissions.
        3.4.1.3. RCRA, 40 CFR 260 for hazardous waste tanks.
        3.4.1.4. RCRA 40 CFR 279 for used oil tanks.
        3.4.1.5. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) for fire and safety.
     3.4.2. State AST Regulations. At the time of this publication, Florida, Virginia, and South Dakota
     are the only states affecting ACC that currently regulate ASTs. Other states are expected to publish
     new regulations in the future. Each installation tank managers must verify with their respective state
     regulator agencies whether ASTs are regulated within their state. Most states require registration and
     some require operating permits.
     3.4.3. AST Siting and Design. Siting, screening, and design of ASTs must conform to AFI 32-1023
     Design and Construction Standards and Execution of Facility Construction Projects. All AST loca-
     tions and screening must be approved by HQ ACC/CEC. Send a site plan for each tank to HQ ACC/
     CEC for approval during the planning phase of the project. If considering vaulted storage tanks,
     review confined space requirements and safety issues. HQ ACC/CEO will provide technical com-

  ments, if requested. Additional costs incurred to comply with siting requirements must be pro-
  grammed for and funded by the project.
  3.4.4. Tank Custodian Training. Tank custodian training will be provided by the Base Fuels Man-
  agement Flights and will cover both ASTs and USTs. AFI 23-204 covers tank custodian training,
  requirements, procedures, and responsibilities.
  3.4.5. Funding. EC funding is provided in accordance with Chapter 15.

RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRAM

4.1. General Requirements. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was passed in 1976 and
established the statutory requirements that are the basis of the hazardous waste regulations found in 40
CFR 260 through 280. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 made many
changes to RCRA and also established the requirements to cleanup hazardous waste releases. The estab-
lishment of the corrective actions program as an adjunct to the RCRA permit has brought RCRA regula-
tory cleanup oversight at many ACC bases.
     4.1.1. Responsibilities:
        4.1.1.1. Responsibility for the management of the "RCRA corrective actions program" (RCAP)
        rests primarily within the base environmental flight; supported by guidance and resources from
        the MAJCOM and Air Staff. Table 4.1. and Table 4.2. summarize the primary responsibilities of
        Command and base level program managers.

Table 4.1. MAJCOM Responsibilities.
 Overall Command RCAP program policy and guidance
 Advocates and validates RCAP funding requirements
 Allocates resources to satisfy RCAP regulatory requirements
 Provides Command strategy and direction to installations to maintain compliance
 Coordinates with other MAJCOMs, HQ USAF/ILEV and other Federal and state agencies relative to
 the RCAP program

System (DFAS).
Comply with compliance schedules and regulatory permit requirements
Keep the MAJCOM informed of issues and conditions which have precedent setting or funding impacts
for the Command or installation
Negotiate with regulatory agency in coordination with applicable Regional Compliance Office to
obtain the most reasonable compliance plan for each solid waste management unit (SWMU)

   4.1.3. Policy Guidance. ACC's goals in the ECP-funded RCRA-CA process are:
      4.1.3.1. Satisfy the legal responsibilities to restore CA sites IAW RCRA (and CERCLA as appli-
      cable).
      4.1.3.2. Use risk-based cleanup measures as the standard.
      4.1.3.3. Conduct cost-effective cleanup under the corrective action program.
      4.1.3.4. Complete cleanup in a timely manner.
      4.1.3.5. Ensure the public has a meaningful opportunity to participate in corrective action deci-
      sion-making
      4.1.3.6. Maintain consistency across different cleanup programs, and across state lines and EPA
      regions, to the maximum extent possible.
      4.1.3.7. Achieve finality in the cleanup of sites (i.e., sites have close-out date estimates which are
      met).
      4.1.3.8. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the primary statute, supported
      by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984. The limited RCRA regulations
      that pertain to corrective actions are found in 40 CFR Parts 264, 265, and 270. On 22 Oct 98, EPA
      issued a final rule (see Federal Register Vol. 63, No. 204, Page 56709) to allow certain regulated
      units to close utilizing the corrective action program. As a result of this rule, EPA and the autho-
      rized states will have discretion to use corrective action requirements, rather than closure require-
      ments.
   4.1.4. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
   requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
   provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
   sound engineering and/or environmental practices, which maintain environmental compliance.
   4.1.5. Applicability. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations,
   ANG, and AFRES units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing com-
   mander. Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordina-
   tion with the host installation.
60                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        4.1.5.1. This guidance does not apply to ACC installations located in foreign countries. Accord-
        ing to AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program in Foreign Countries, overseas sites will be restored
        only to sustain current operations or eliminate known imminent and substantial dangers to human
        health and safety.

4.2. Permits.
     4.2.1. Enforceability. The EPA enforces the RCRA-CA program principally through the statutory
     authorities established by the HSWA of 1984. The Agency proposed a rule (55 Federal Register (FR)
     30798, July 27, 1990), that would implement under HSWA a comprehensive regulatory framework
     for conducting the corrective action program. The proposed rule was commonly known as "Subpart S
     Proposal" after the location within 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 264 where the rule
     would be codified. In October 1999, EPA withdrew most provisions of the 1990 proposed regulations
     on corrective action as most states already have program already authorized for corrective actions.
     4.2.2. Part B Permit. RCAP sites are typically incorporated into the base Part B permit. However,
     many sites may have been identified subsequent to when the permit was issued. All sites must be
     addressed to the satisfaction of the appropriate regulators before formal closure. If areas of concern
     (AOC) are identified by regulatory agencies for addition to your Part B permit compliance schedule
     consult with HQ ACC/CEV/JAV prior to the comment period on the proposal. In many cases regula-
     tory agency proposed AOC additions are inappropriate.

4.3. Corrective Action Program Management.
     4.3.1. RCAP Requirements. The release of hazardous constituents to the environment from ACC
     processes after Dec 1984 may require cleanup under RCRA. These cleanup actions are regulated by
     strict protocol standards referred to as Corrective Actions. Base program managers communicate
     environmental compliance funds requirements via ACES-PM to headquarters. Each line item must be
     fully documented complete with adequate justifications why the work is required by environmental
     regulation or permit. See Chapter 15 for a complete description of ACES-PM input requirements.
        4.3.1.1. The American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed Standard E 1739
        that applies to POL contaminated sites. This standard is a risk-based method for resolving
        clean-up levels at SWMU sites. Evaluate all POL contaminated sites using the ASTM standard as
        part of the justification for ECP funding. Indicate within the ACES-PM project description
        ASTM E 1739 evaluation was completed. In addition, utilize the standard in negotiations with
        regulatory agencies.
        4.3.1.2. The objective of all cleanup actions within ACC is to fully comply with all regulatory
        requirements while meeting mission objectives in the most cost-effective means available. Bud-
        get constraints are a reality and program managers must plan carefully and aggressively defend all
        requests for environmental funds. Do not commit to fund actions requested by regulatory agen-
        cies without prior coordination and concurrence from HQ ACC/CEVQ.
        4.3.1.3. Base environmental flights oversee all RCAP actions for their bases, regardless of the
        regulatory driver or funding source. The base RPM and HQ ACC/CEVR also conduct RCRA
        work funded by ERA. Two primary factors affect the way ACC must manage its RCRA Correc-
        tive Actions (RCA) requirements, funding source and timing. The RCAP objectives are to ensure
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         61


     consistency between RCAP and Environmental Restoration Account (ERA) work at each base
     while meeting regulatory requirements.
  4.3.2. RCAP Phases and Areas of Interest:
     4.3.2.1. Whether required by an order or a permit condition, the RCAP consists of four principal
     phases or components: RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA) (conducted by the regulatory agency
     and is not eligible for EC funding); RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI); Corrective Measures
     Study (CMS); and the Corrective Measures Implementation (CMI). The RCRA Corrective
     Actions program phases are similar to major program phases contained within the corresponding
     CERCLA processes in the Air Force's ERA program.
     4.3.2.2. Chief Financial Officer Act (CFOA). The CFOA became law in 1990 and requires
     government to look at operations in a business fashion, including identifying assets and liabilities
     for every program. Annually, the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) reports the condition of the
     Air Force, including the assets and liabilities in an Annual Financial Statement. Defense Environ-
     mental Restoration Program (DERP) and non-DERP environmental cleanup costs are included in
     this report. The focus of CFOA for the Air Force is to report all known environmental liabilities.
     For the RCAP this requires the following actions by ACC installations until HQ USAF/ILEV
     develops program management guidance (scheduled for FY02):
        4.3.2.2.1. Maintain the cost-to-complete (CTC) for all RCRA Corrective Actions sites using
        the Remedial Action Cost Engineering and Requirements (RACER) system.
            4.3.2.2.1.1. Documentation of all cost estimates to include assumptions, regulations, con-
            ditions, criteria, and relevant items effecting costs.
        4.3.2.2.2. Apply DERP guidance to the RCAP to the maximum extent possible.
        4.3.2.2.3. Use the ACES-EM Restoration Module, when implemented, to record RCAP infor-
        mation (site ID, cost-to-complete, closure costs, etc.).
        4.3.2.2.4. Report RCAP environmental liabilities via an annual data call.

5.1. General Requirements.
     5.1.1. Responsibilities. The ACC Pollution Prevention and Media sections (HQ ACC/CEVQP and
     CEVQM) are responsible for policy development, guidance and resource allocation for the solid
     waste program. Base level solid waste program managers, CEO personnel, QAE and Range person-
     nel are all responsible for the implementation and maintenance of solid waste programs.
     5.1.2. Policy Guidance. See also applicable Air Force policy found in AFI 32-7042, Solid and

     included in 40 CFR 256-259 and Executive Orders 12780 and 13101.
     5.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
     requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
     provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
     sound engineering and/or environmental practices that maintain environmental compliance.
     5.1.4. Applicability. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations,
     ANG, and AFRES units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing com-
     mander. Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordina-
     tion with the host installation.

5.2. Permits. Municipal solid waste landfill and clean rubble landfill permits differ from state to state. It
will be necessary for individual solid waste managers to refer to state guidelines. Ensure contractors and
transporting vehicles are permitted for solid waste handling, storage, and collection. Asbestos landfills
are a specialized type of solid waste landfill which requires a state permit. See Chapter 6 for ACC policy
on these specialized landfills. It is ACC policy to not create new solid waste, asbestos, construction, or
other type landfills.

5.3. Solid Waste.
     5.3.1. ACC Landfill Policy. ACC policy is to eliminate on-base solid waste landfills wherever pos-
     sible, and installations will not open any new landfills without the approval of ACC/CEV. Installa-
     tions will be required to clean any dumping sites that are found so they will not be considered
     un-permitted landfills. EPA regulations 40 CFR 258, revised location restrictions, facility design and
     operating criteria, groundwater monitoring requirements, corrective action requirements, financial
     assurance requirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements. Each state is allowed to
     implement its own "approved" programs.
     5.3.2. Monitoring Landfills. Existing or closed ACC landfills will typically be required to imple-
     ment some form of groundwater monitoring program. Check with your state regulatory agency for
     specific requirements. Request for EC or CTP2 funds should be inputted early through ACES-PM
     with specific regulatory citations provided to assure prompt validation.
     5.3.3. Additional Information. Refer to Chapter 18 for additional guidance on reducing and man-
     aging solid waste.

5.4. Solid Waste Special Topics.
   5.4.1. Land Farming Disposal of Petroleum Contaminated Soil. Land farming is a viable method
   for treating POL contaminated soil from regulated UST cleanup actions. Material from regulated
   UST cleanup is not a RCRA solid waste per 40 CFR 261.4(b)(10) even if the petroleum-contaminated
   media and debris fail the toxicity characteristics of 40 CFR 261.24, have hazardous waste codes D018
   through D043, and the material is subject to the corrective action regulations under 40 CFR 280. EC
   or CTP2 funds are a valid for land farming if the following requirements are met:
       5.4.1.1. The project is a valid Level 1 request in ACES-PM. To be eligible for EC/CTP2 funding
       the request must document the non-compliant condition the land-farming project will correct.
       5.4.1.2. The action is based on a specific environmental regulatory requirement (e.g., RCRA).
       5.4.1.3. The action is not eligible for ERA or Housing funds.
       5.4.1.4. A cost estimate is prepared for the complete land farming process. This includes
       in-house costs and contract costs.
       5.4.1.5. The length of the project and the cost of the project by fiscal year are identified.
       5.4.1.6. An economic analysis is developed to compare the cost of traditional disposal (incinera-
       tion) versus land farming disposal.
       5.4.1.7. The material is not a solid waste as defined by RCRA 40 CFR 261.4, Exclusions.
       5.4.1.8. The project must stand-alone and be finite in length. This means that future POL spills
       could be remedied using the land farm facility. Funding for remediation of future POL spills
       would be dealt with on a case by case basis, depending on the particular facts involved in each
       case.
       5.4.1.9. Regulatory compliance issues must be addressed prior to the start of the project. All local
       permits and approvals must be prepared and approved by the applicable state or local regulatory
       agency.
   5.4.2. Composite Fiber Material Disposal.
       5.4.2.1. Composite fiber material disposal is managed by the Defense Reutilization and Market-
       ing Service (DRMS). Composite fiber materials include some aircraft skins, aircraft wreckage
       parts, and Kevlar protective equipment. Composite fibers are similar in appearance to fiberglass.
       Composite fiber materials may consist of carbon, carbon/graphite, carbon/boron, or boron/tung-
       sten. These fibers have health hazards similar to fiberglass, such as bronchial and skin irritation.
       5.4.2.2. The DRMS turn-in requirements for damaged composite fiber materials. The intention of
       DRMS is to prevent the release of composite fibers during handling of the solid waste. The com-
       posite fibers are treated with a fixative (typically a mixture of water and floor wax) and placed in
       a durable plastic bag, sealed, and labeled for turn-in to DRMS. The turn-in document will contain
       a certification that the material was treated with a fixative.
       5.4.2.3. Final regulatory compliance issues must be addressed prior to the start of the disposal
       action. If the State regulates composite fiber disposal, the state regulations take precedence over
       the DRMS instructions. In no case should disposal actions be any less rigorous than the DRMS
       instructions.
   5.4.3. Disposal of Solid Waste Arriving at ACC Bases From Overseas.
64                               ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


     5.4.3.1. To prevent the spread of disease and insect pests, Department of Agriculture regulations
     at Title 7 CFR Part 330.400, and Title 9 CFR Part 94.5, Animal and Animal Products, elaborate on
     the requirements for treating and disposing garbage arriving from overseas. Installations may
     need to seek a compliance agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to handle foreign
     garbage and properly dispose of it. Overseas garbage arriving on aircraft or other conveyance,
     must be incinerated, sterilized, or treated in an approved wastewater treatment facility. Refer to
     the referenced documents for details on application and implementation of the regulations.

           6.1.1.2.9. Inputs air compliance requirements via the ACES-PM system. Air requirements
           are identified for the current and six future years.
     6.1.2. Policy Guidance.
        6.1.2.1. Applicable Air Force policy guidance for air quality is found in AFI 32-7040. The
        instruction outlines Federal and Air Force regulations for operating and maintaining air emission
        sources to ensure effective operation and maintenance of air emission sources, while protecting
        the environment. It is Air Force policy to comply with federal, state, and local regulations.
        6.1.2.2. The Clean Air Act (CAA) 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., as amended in 1990 is the primary fed-
        eral statute. The objective of the act is to "protect and enhance the quality of the nation's air
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          67


      resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its popula-
      tion". The act seeks to prevent and control air pollution within regional areas by controlling sta-
      tionary and mobile sources of emission. This manual establishes ACC's air quality policy
      framework within which base level air managers must operate to achieve CAA environmental
      compliance.
   6.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to policies contained in this chapter may be requested
   through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and provide ade-
   quate explanation for the waiver request. The justification must be based on sound engineering and/
   or environmental practices while maintaining environmental compliance.
   6.1.4. Applicability.
      6.1.4.1. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations, ANG, and
      AFRES units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing commander.
      Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordination
      with the host installation.
      6.1.4.2. This guidance does not apply to ACC installations located in foreign countries. ACC
      encourages air emission inventories for criteria and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) at overseas
      locations to better understand air pollutant emissions and the potential impacts to air quality. For
      environmental compliance at ACC OCONUS installations and operations, use the applicable DoD
      Final Governing Standards (FGS) in place of this command guidance. Overseas ACC locations
      should use requirements in this guidance document for information on how to effectively manage
      their air programs.

6.2. Permits.
   6.2.1. Requirements. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act (CAA), which initiated new air
   emissions rules and regulations. ACC bases must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local
   air quality regulations; AFI 32-7040 and this manual.
      6.2.1.1. Permits are available to the public making ACC installation operations open to public
      scrutiny and review. Air managers must assure compliance by reviewing all draft or in-force per-
      mit conditions and negotiating realistic conditions where appropriate. Installation managers will
      coordinate with HQ ACC/CEV/JAV and the AFCEE/REO offices to prepare and make substantive
      comments on proposed air permits during the public comment period. Air program managers at
      each base must be diligent in fully complying with all permit conditions and alternative operating
      scenarios. States require installation permit constructed, modified, or reconstructed air emission
      sources unless the sources are exempt from permitting requirements. Installation must verify per-
      mits, if required, are obtained for construction, modification, or reconstruction of diesel tanks,
      boilers, generators, surface coating booths, engine test cells, truck loading racks, wood hobby
      shop, bead blasters, and firing range bullet catchment systems.
      6.2.1.2. The air manager must develop comprehensive and complete management tools to ensure
      the base maintains compliance with all permit conditions. This may involve extensive record
      keeping by many different organizations on the installation as well as periodic emissions testing as
      required by the permit. Air managers shall maintain the ACES-EM air module to fully demon-
      strate compliance with their respective state air regulations.
   6.2.2. Permit Fees:
68                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        6.2.2.1. Permit fees may be required by any base which engages in operating, modifying, demol-
        ishing, or constructing a stationary source of air pollution obtain or which renew construction or
        operating permits as required by federal, state, or local air emission regulatory agencies. These
        activities may be as simple as changing solvent tanks, installing or upgrading a generator, or con-
        structing a paint booth.
        6.2.2.2. Ensure planning for operating permits that include stringent pollution controls, monitor-
        ing of pollution output, modeling of pollution and/or meteorological conditions, record keeping,
        public review and the use of offsets. ACC (and its installations) must comply with environmental
        permit requirements at all levels of regulation.
        6.2.2.3. Annual emission fees may be required in a state. These fees can begin at $25/ton/year of
        actual criteria pollutant emissions and proceed upwards (fees for CO are not chargeable pursuant
        to the Clean Air Act). States may charge based on Potential to Emit (PTE).
     6.2.3. Permit Planning:
        6.2.3.1. Ensure all project budgets requiring modification or construction of a major air pollution
        source provide for pollution controls as required by air regulations. This should be done in
        advance of the submittal of an application for a construction or operating permit, budget for the
        application and use of offsets in ACES-PM.
        6.2.3.2. Three important federally mandated permit activities impact operations at ACC bases:
            6.2.3.2.1. Title V (40 CFR 70) operating permit program from the amendments to the CAA of
            1990.
            6.2.3.2.2. Construction and operating permit in a non-attainment area requiring a New Source
            Review for pre-construction permit.
            6.2.3.2.3. Construction and operating permit in attainment areas known as the Prevention of
            Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. Some states, counties, cities and regional bodies
            also require additional permits, registrations and/or notifications.
        6.2.3.3. ACC air managers must review each project and determine the types of permits required.
        Examine new construction plans carefully to determine if any part requires air permits.
        6.2.3.4. Typically large emergency generators, boilers, corrosion control facilities, large fuel
        tanks, fuel load racks, and dispensing hydrants and incinerators require permits and/or permit
        modifications. Fire training, open burn/open detonation of munitions, cutback asphalt batch
        plants, waste solvent recyclers, Non-Destructive Investigation (NDI) labs, and hospital sterilizing
        operations may require permits and/or permit modifications. Jet engine testing facilities, if testing
        the engines while removed from the aircraft, often require permits and/or permit modification.
        Ask the state regulatory air permit bureau if regulations are unclear.
     6.2.4. Title V Permits. The U.S. EPA uses the state and federal (Title V) permit system as the pri-
     mary tool to ensure compliance with air quality regulations. A Title V permit is a facility-wide oper-
     ating permit for sources of air pollution that identifies all federally enforceable CAA requirements.
     Permits issued by states may be facility-wide or single source construction and/or operating permits.
     Title V permits enhance EPA's ability to enforce air regulations.
        6.2.4.1. As required, ACC bases apply for, obtain, and maintain permits under the new permitting
        regulations of Title V Part 70 of the 1990 CAA Amendments, now found at 40 CFR Part 70 and as
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           69


    written into the State Implementation Plan (SIP). Each base must plan and budget for the imple-
    mentation of Title V regulations and the timely payment of air emission permit fees.
    6.2.4.2. The permit is valid for 5 years, but the EPA and the state have the right to reopen an oper-
    ating permit to add new requirements, provided the remaining permit term is longer than three
    years. The base can also request permit revisions, whereas regulators can require permit revision.
    6.2.4.3. The "chief executive officer having responsibility for the overall operations of a principal
    geographic unit of the agency," must sign the Title V permit. For ACC, this individual is the
    installation or wing commander.
    6.2.4.4. Facilities Requiring Title V Permits:
       6.2.4.4.1. Determine if a facility (base) is a major source and could emit a specific output in
       tons per year (tpy) of potential emissions of any criteria pollutant, Hazardous Air Pollutants
       (HAPs), or a combination of HAPs in excess of the major source trigger defined by the state
       regulatory authority.
       6.2.4.4.2. Use the base air emissions inventory to arrive at the major source designation. A
       facility is a major source if the potential emissions are equal to or greater than the limits estab-
       lished by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. The limits are 100 tpy of any sin-
       gle criteria pollutant, 250 tpy of a combination of criteria pollutants, 10 tpy of any one
       Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) or a total of 25 tpy of all HAPs. Criteria pollutants are carbon
       monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter less than or
       equal to 10 microns (PM10), and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). The initial list of
       HAPs is published in section 112 of the Clean Air Act.
       6.2.4.4.3. Air managers must be familiar with the sources included and those excluded from
       emission estimates. These differ based on federal and state laws.
       6.2.4.4.4. ACC bases shall take enforceable emission limits to remain below the thresholds
       listed in paragraph 6.2.4.4.2. and should therefore be considered "synthetic minor" sources.
       When the ACES-EM air module is implemented, maintain an accurate database to demon-
       strate actual and potential air emissions.
       6.2.4.4.5. All ACC bases chose to keep emissions under the major source threshold for HAPs
       to maintain "area source," also referred to as "minor source," status to avoid many National
       Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) requirements. Notify HQ ACC/
       CEVQ if your installation approaches the limits for HAPs major source designation.
    6.2.4.5. Sources and Location:
       6.2.4.5.1. Update AEI's and post data to the ACES-EM air module on a regular bases suffi-
       cient to document the installation's air emissions major/minor/synthetic source classification.
       This documentation must enable base air managers to validate and verify air emissions com-
       pliance status and document equipment maintenance specified by the manufacturer. If a state
       requires a twelve-month rolling total, AEI updates should be no less frequent than monthly.
       Only the portion of the AEI needed to maintain currency requires updating.
       6.2.4.5.2. All bases must calculate both actual and potential to emit emission totals for their
       air emissions inventories. To determine the major source designation, match the emission
       totals with the area classification of the Air Quality Region (AQR). The particular classifica-
70                               ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        tion of the bases geographical locale, found in 40 CFR Part 52, is subject to alteration depend-
        ing on the ability of pollution sources in the region to comply with the National Ambient Air
        Quality Standards (NAAQS). If a base's criteria pollutant emissions are less than the major
        source limit, the state may designate it as a minor source with less stringent regulations and
        possibly lower permit fees.
        6.2.4.5.3. Local air district regulations require that installations keep current copies of permits
        on file and post them next to the air emission sources.
     6.2.4.6. Air Inventory Exemptions. A state can exempt a base from the annual air emissions
     inventory under specific conditions. Keep a letter from the state regulatory agency on file, con-
     firming the exemption unless citation of a state regulation shows compliance.
     6.2.4.7. Emission Fees:
        6.2.4.7.1. All ACC bases must submit air emission documentation and permit data to the state
        regulatory agency. Bases must comply with the timely payment of all permit fees connected
        with their state air program.
        6.2.4.7.2. Many ACC bases are major sources for Title V. Some Title V operating permits
        require operating limits, or a ceiling on emissions. HQ ACC/CEVQ recommends this operat-
        ing limit be as high as possible to facilitate mission flexibility, while limiting the impact of
        regulation, such as NESHAPs. As a minimum, the operating ceiling should allow for typical
        operations and the excess hours encountered during an emergency exercise, or other extreme
        conditions.
        6.2.4.7.3. The officer-in-charge (OIC) or the non-commissioned officer-in-charge (NCOIC)
        of a shop or function operating pollution emitting equipment must coordinate on the permit.
        Base-level environmental manager, through the installation Environmental Protection Com-
        mittee, should request coordination on all permit conditions written in the Title V permit. The
        individual in charge of the facility must certify the permit conditions allow completion of the
        mission during the 5-year term of the permit.
     6.2.4.8. Timing. Begin permit writing requirements at the earliest possible date. To prepare for
     the permit writing process, review State Implementation Plans (SIPs) and information published
     by the state, including hearings on new Title V permit rule writing and implementation. States
     may require submittal of permit applications before EPA approves the program. Eventually EPA
     approves all SIPs or takes over administration of the Federal permit program.
     6.2.4.9. Recordkeeping:
        6.2.4.9.1. Keep accurate records of jet engine testing, paint usage and other air pollutant
        sources necessary to fully characterize the HAP and criteria pollutant emissions of the instal-
        lation. Also, keep records sufficient to comply with air permit and regulatory reporting
        requirements.
        6.2.4.9.2. Quality characterization through accurate record keeping of the base's facilities pro-
        vides the data needed to arrive at the best mission essential operating conditions. The base
        must include all potential operating scenarios planned for use at the facility in the permit. This
        approach incorporates variations like peak painting per hour at a corrosion facility, all types of
        paint allowed for use, all possible operating conditions of a jet engine test cell, and worst case
        operation of electrical stand-by generators during extreme or emergency conditions. Consider
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           71


        every possible operating condition that occurs under favorable or unfavorable conditions.
        Push the flexibility of the permit to the cost feasible limit. Prepare to submit the essential
        requirements contained in the permit to validate the actual emissions and potential to emit of
        each pollution source on the base.
        6.2.4.9.3. Recordkeeping is of particular importance at Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
        facilities. EOD facilities should track the date/time of response, names/grades of response
        members, items/materials used, quantities used, disposition of the munitions, reason (training
        or emergency), and a copy of any emergency permits. EOD units must retain these records for
        three years. While these emissions seem small, ACC bases must demonstrate these emissions
        are insignificant when requested by proper regulator authority.
     6.2.4.10. Control Equipment Alternative Operating Scenarios:
        6.2.4.10.1. If a source (base) uses pollution control equipment in order to comply with the
        permit, it is necessary to write an alternate operating scenario into the permit. If the control
        equipment fails and no alternative operating procedure or "upset" procedure is in the permit,
        the operation of the source will be in violation.
        6.2.4.10.2. The source may have to cease operation until repair of the control equipment is
        completed. An alternate operating condition for a paint booth may include switching opera-
        tions to another facility on base. Under this permit condition, the alternative operating proce-
        dure must account for additional load on the backup booth as an increase in output or potential
        to emit. For control of VOC emissions, rerouting contaminated air to an alternate filter system
        during failure of the primary system is one option.
     6.2.4.11. Operational Flexibility and the 7-Day Rule:
        6.2.4.11.1. Make use of the 7-day rule as written in the SIP. A permitted facility (base) can
        make some permit changes without a mandatory permit revision, if the changes are not modi-
        fications under any provision of CAA Title I and the changes do not exceed the emissions
        allowed under the permit.
        6.2.4.11.2. Each base should review these rules in order to execute minor modifications and
        permit alterations with as little mission impact as possible. EPA expects all SIPs to include an
        adoption of the 7-day rule, or a form of operational flexibility for permit modifications.
     6.2.4.12. Legal Review. The Title V permit is a 5-year contract. Base JA and HQ ACC/JAV
     must conduct a review of all air permits. Permit development schedules should be planned to
     allow legal adequate review time before the deadline for submittal to the permitting authority.
  6.2.5. Construction Permits in Attainment Areas and the Prevention of Significant Deteriora-
  tion (PSD) Program.
     6.2.5.1. Evaluate all construction projects relative to PSD. A new source or a modification to an
     existing source in an attainment area may be subject to three permit provisions: a state program;
     the federal PSD program; or the new HAP requirements of Title III to the Act.
     6.2.5.2. Bases are likely to exceed the trigger values for PSD listed in Table 6.1. by constructing
     a large source such as a corrosion control facility, one or more jet engine test cells, a central heat
     plant, or an electrical power co-generation facility. Use this table as a guide to estimate whether a
     PSD review may be required for any proposed action. If a proposed action will exceed any of
72                                ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      these triggers than further detailed investigation is required to determine the specific environmen-
      tal air pollution review that is needed. Consult with HQ ACC/CEV/JAV in coordination with
      installation regulatory agencies to determine the correct course of action.

      6.2.5.3. Best Available Control Technology (BACT) Analysis:
          6.2.5.3.1. Determine if the proposed construction is a major source modification under PSD in
          an attainment area then proceed through the remaining elements of the PSD application pro-
          cess.
          6.2.5.3.2. PSD includes three analyses for each pollutant emitted in significantly increased
          amounts: the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) analysis, air quality impact analy-
          sis, and an additional impact analysis.
      6.2.5.4. A required "top down BACT" analysis involves five steps:
          6.2.5.4.1. Step 1. Identify all emission control technology and alternative processes including
          the processes in Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER).
          6.2.5.4.2. Step 2. Ensure elimination of any control options that are not technically feasible
          for use on a source.
          6.2.5.4.3. Step 3. Identify the most effective emission control by ranking each candidate from
          the top down.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        73


        6.2.5.4.4. Step 4. Conduct an analysis of economic, energy and other environmental impacts
        of each control technology.
        6.2.5.4.5. Step 5. Select the BACT emission control for the source.
     6.2.5.5. The five steps of an air quality impact analysis include:
        6.2.5.5.1. Step 1. Determine the impact area for each pollutant analyzed.
        6.2.5.5.2. Step 2. Inventory all other sources.
        6.2.5.5.3. Step 3. List sources that add to the impact of existing ambient concentrations.
        6.2.5.5.4. Step 4. Perform a screening model analysis.
        6.2.5.5.5. Step 5. Project air quality with an air dispersion model.
     6.2.5.6. The additional impacts include three components: a growth analysis, a soils and vegeta-
     tion impact analysis, and a visibility impairment analysis. The EPA Air Pollution Training Insti-
     tute (APTI) offers "SI: 453 Overview of PSD", a regulations self-instruction course available for
     detailed learning on this subject. For information on BACT see Section 165(a)(4) CAA, 40 CFR
     52.21 (j), 40 CFR 51.166, and in the SIPs of various states at 40 CFR Part 52, Subpart A - Subpart
     FFF.
  6.2.6. Construction Permits in Non-attainment Areas and the New Source Review Program.
     6.2.6.1. Review construction projects in a non-attainment area for New Source Review Require-
     ments if they fall under the major source category. Construction of a major source in a non-attain-
     ment area involves Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) controls. These are the most costly
     and stringent controls available. When a base triggers a New Source Review, an application for a
     pre-construction permit is required. The trigger pollution tons per year (TPY) amounts are shown
     in Table 6.1.
     6.2.6.2. Construction or modification of an air emission source in a non-attainment area requires
     offsets.
        6.2.6.2.1. A base may build a new source or modify an existing source if the project does not
        increase the total criteria emissions. Use offsets to accomplish this. The 1977 Amendments
        require that for every ton of increased emissions the new source will emit, an offset must occur
        with a reduction of at least one ton of that pollutant by internally reducing emissions or by
        obtaining offsets from other facilities.
        6.2.6.2.2. The 1990 CAAA increased the offsets for ozone and can go as high as 1.5:1. For
        instance, in a moderate non-attainment area, construction of a new major source requires a
        1.15:1 offset ratio. Offset ratios of non-attainment areas are listed in 40 CFR Part 51, Appen-
        dix S. The source must reduce through controls or pollution prevention 115 tpy of VOCs for
        each 100 tpy added by construction or modification.
     6.2.6.3. Netting and Pollution Control Devices:
        6.2.6.3.1. Review construction projects in non-attainment areas for possible use of netting.
        Avoid the NSR requirements by achieving reductions of an equal or greater amount of emis-
        sions, this is designed to offset the increase in emissions at the new or modified source. This
        procedure is netting.
74                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


           6.2.6.3.2. The reductions in VOCs from the change to JP-8 fuel may accomplish the task, or
           locate reductions/offsets elsewhere on base by closing down or moving operations. After
           applying the offsets, apply LAER pollution control rules. You must model the emissions of
           the source to prove LAER is working. Factor in these costs for future construction of
           non-attainment sources during the design phase.
        6.2.6.4. Existing Source Standards:
           6.2.6.4.1. Examine existing sources or emission points and determine the need for a permit,
           controls or other requirements. Determine the requirements, including recordkeeping and
           documentation, to bring each source into compliance within the timeframe required.
           6.2.6.4.2. State air permit laws and regulations have existed since the 1970's. A number of
           new air emission sources have been identified during the Title V air permit development pro-
           gram. Base environmental flights must insure all new and modified air emission sources are
           identified and appropriately permitted prior to the start of construction. To insure all emission
           sources have been properly identified, base air managers must coordinate on construction
           projects prior to design.

6.3. Hazardous Air Pollutants.
     6.3.1. Compliance:
        6.3.1.1. Sources emitting a designated pollutant regulated by Title III must comply with all
        requirements, or any more stringent state or local requirements. Title III of the 1990 CAA
        Amendments identifies 189 HAPs regulated under the air toxics program as suspected causes of
        cancer or other human health problems. These are known as the National Emissions Standards for
        Hazardous Air Pollutants found in 40 CFR Section 70, Air Toxics provisions and Title III of the
        1990 Amendments.
        6.3.1.2. The EPA defined and published specific source categories that the new rules regulate.
        The HAP definition of a major source is any source with the potential to emit 10 tpy of any HAP
        or 25 tpy total HAP emissions, or any National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
        (NESHAP) sources.
        6.3.1.3. The following is a partial list of HAPS that contribute to high air toxic totals at many
        ACC bases and their possible origin at ACC installations (Table 6.2.). All ACC bases are area
        sources for HAPs. This status must be diligently maintained. Any base approaching the major
        source thresholds for HAPs must notify HQ ACC/CEVQM immediately and be prepared to
        develop a strategy to continue compliance, either as an area source or a major source.

      6.3.1.4. A recommended source for air toxic information on ACC bases was published in the
      1994 ACC Environmental Symposium proceedings publication, Finding and Managing Air Tox-
      ics, page 365.
   6.3.2. Hazardous Air Pollutants Emission Standards. EPA promulgated the Aerospace National
   Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) final rule affecting aircraft painting
   operations 15 Sep 95 requiring compliance by 1 Sep 98. This is the first NESHAP applicable to ACC
   bases should they become major HAP sources. Cross check the listed sources in Title III with the cur-
   rent list at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/mactfnl.html for the most current information.
      6.3.2.1. Additional log keeping requirements may be necessary if the base has an unusual source
      that falls into one of the listed categories. Be alert for changes to the Title III HAP list that may
      impact base operations. For installations subject to the Halogenated Solvent Cleaning NESHAP
      (40 CFR 63, Subpart T) air emission reduction operating instructions must be conspicuously
      posted near solvent cleaning tanks.
      6.3.2.2. Table 6.3. is a partial list of categories of sources of HAPs regulated under Title III with
      an emphasis on sources common to ACC bases. The table also contains the expected dates of pub-
      lication for the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), also
      referred to as Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT), for some categories.

     6.3.3. Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Requirements:
        6.3.3.1. If the base is a major source for HAPs under Title III of the CAA the use of controls or
        elimination of HAP sources may enable the facility to avoid adopting MACT requirements. For
        HAP major source determination, include all stationary emissions on base, fence line to fence line,
        under the command of the Air Force. This does not include AAFES, National Guard, Navy or
        Coast Guard units.
        6.3.3.2. MACT includes prescribed add-on pollution control devices and process specifications to
        limit the amount of toxics from a HAP source filtrating into the atmosphere.
        6.3.3.3. If a base is a HAP major source, the biggest pollution emitters may require controls. The
        least expensive method of compliance will be pollution prevention. If that is not feasible, then
        ACC installation should study the use of add-on controls and alternative processes.
        6.3.3.4. Table 6.4. lists the types of controls typical of MACT for emissions to include organic
        vapor, organic particulates, inorganic vapors, and inorganic particulates:

Table 6.4. MACT Controls.
            MACT Controls
            Thermal incineration-works well, but costly
            Catalytic incineration-works well, not as costly as thermal
            Flaring-may release other contaminates
            Adsorption-standard in the industry, one pass not always sufficient to clean air
            Absorption-very common and not expensive
            Condensation (with refrigeration)-not as efficient
            Wet/Venturi scrubbing-works well; initial costs may be high
            Fabric filters (baghouse)-wide spread usage; requires good maintenance

6.4. Control Strategies. Bases plan and budget for air pollution control measures mandated for selected
emitters of criteria pollutants or air toxics sources to achieve compliance. Like a carbon absorber for paint
emissions. Current ACC funding requirements mandate the early programming and forecasting of control
technology needs prior to regulatory deadlines. ACC/CEVQ encourages the use of controls to limit emis-
sions of criteria and HAPs when funding for their installation is justifiable and economically practical.
Submit projects for control devices through the ACES-PM.

  6.4.1. There are a variety of control technologies that may be directed by regulatory agencies. These
  include:
     6.4.1.1. Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). The EPA has issued control tech-
     nique guideline documents (CTG) defining RACT requirements for specific industrial processes.
     These controls will impact large sources (100 tpy) in ACC.
     6.4.1.2. Best Available Control Technology (BACT) applies to any major source or major modi-
     fication subject to prevention of serious deterioration (PSD) requirements of an attainment area.
     This technology impacts new construction or modifications to existing sources at most ACC bases
     located in attainment areas. See paragraph 6.2.5.3. for a discussion of the analysis required in a
     BACT study.
     6.4.1.3. Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) is emission limitation based on the
     best demonstrated control technology or practices used in similar major sources of toxic (HAP)
     pollutants. These controls reduce emissions on major sources of air toxics. ACC bases are autho-
     rized to develop programs to eliminate all major sources of air toxics by chemical reductions and
     substitutions.
     6.4.1.4. Area sources not defined as major sources may require Generally Available Control
     Technologies (GACT). This could include good management practices to reduce HAP at costs
     considerably less than the cost of MACT. ACC bases should adopt these practices where they are
     applicable.
     6.4.1.5. Best Available Control Measure (BACM) applies to controlling emissions from small or
     dispersed sources of PM; such as roadway dust, wood stoves or open burning practices. Monitor
     these practices daily during base construction projects, demolition of structures and road or park-
     ing lot "dirt work".
     6.4.1.6. Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER). New sources in non-attainment areas
     require LAER technology. It is the most expensive and more stringent than BACT, or RACT, as it
     disallows the source from taking the cost of controls into determining feasibility. ACC bases
     should plan projects carefully at non-attainment bases to avoid the LAER requirement.
  6.4.2. Paint and Air Emissions:
     6.4.2.1. Corrosion control operations encompass the preparation and subsequent spray painting of
     aircraft, aircraft parts, Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), and maintenance vehicles.
     6.4.2.2. At each ACC Base, maintainers typically paint aircraft parts, AGE, and vehicles in sev-
     eral conventional spray booths. While designed and for the most part used for a certain type of
     article, the booths exhibit sufficient commonalties for use with multiple types of articles.
     6.4.2.3. Corrosion control operations:
         6.4.2.3.1. ACC paints small to medium size aircraft, such as training aircraft and fighters, in
         hangars or large spray booths. ACC paints large aircraft, such as bombers and tankers in han-
         gars. Examine these operations to ensure emission control systems are operated correctly and
         maintained regularly. If they are part of the installations operating permit or have a separate
         state air permit, ensure the control system is operated in accordance with the permit.
         6.4.2.3.2. Corrosion control operations include preparing articles for painting, painting the
         articles, and allowing the articles to dry. Preparation includes sanding the article, stripping it
78                                       ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


            of paint, taping parts of it, and wiping it down. Preparation work and painting are often per-
            formed in the same booth or hangar, unless the requirements for painting prohibit preparation
            work such as sanding (which generates dust) in the same booth or hangar.
            6.4.2.3.3. Corrosion control painting involves either touching up or entirely repainting an
            item. ACC touches up small defects (thumb to fist size) on surface areas of aircraft to prevent
            the defect from expanding. Nominal usage for this purpose is a maximum of 5 gallons of coat-
            ing used per week, and an average of 2 to 3 gallons of paint per week (ACC contracted study,
            Selection of Technologies for VOC Control at ACC Corrosion Control Facilities, Aug 1994,
            page 3-4).
            6.4.2.3.4. An aircraft is entirely repainted on average every 2 to 6 years, depending on the
            type of aircraft. Some bases complete large-scale defect repair, scuff, sand and overcoat, in
            addition to sending the aircraft to a depot for full refurbishment. Typically, fighter aircraft are
            scuffed, sanded and overcoated at the base, and large frame aircraft are only touched up at the
            base. An average of 14 gallons per fighter is used, and the spray time averages from 8 to 9
            hours per aircraft. Typical fighter painting schedules are one aircraft painted every 1 to 4
            weeks. (Disclaimer: The averages in this paragraph are presented here for base level environ-
            mental managers planning guidance and understanding. Painting operations at ACC installa-
            tions vary significantly depending on many factors. Base air managers must consult with their
            logistics corrosion control counterparts to obtain accurate paint statistics.).
        6.4.2.4. Control Options:
            6.4.2.4.1. Add-on VOC control technologies for spray booths.
            6.4.2.4.2. Carbon Absorption.
            6.4.2.4.3. Incineration.
            6.4.2.4.4. Condensation.
            6.4.2.4.5. Fabric filters.
     6.4.3. Jet Engine Testing:
        6.4.3.1. Control strategies for jet engine testing have been explored by ACC/CEVQ. ACC/CEVQ
        conducted extensive pollution emission characterization testing for the TF30-PW-109 (F-111),
        F110-GE-100 (F-16), and the F-100-PW-200 (F-15) engines in 1995 as part of hush house con-
        struction permitting. The emission test results include characterization of specific hazardous air
        pollutants. Installations needing the results of these test my request copies of the reports from
        ACC/CEVQ.

6.5. Planning For Air Compliance. Each base develops and implements a comprehensive air quality
compliance planning program based on and including requirements of the Federal Agency Pollution
Abatement Plan described in OMB Circular A-106. As a minimum, the compliance planning shall
include the following elements: an emissions inventory, permit requirements with a comparison to the
regulatory requirements and regulatory schedule, and integration of pollution prevention plans and air
emission mitigation strategies.
     6.5.1. Forecast Planning. State and federal regulations continue to be promulgated mandating a
     variety of air quality compliance requirements. Base level managers must become familiar with
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                             79


   resources to enable them to forecast air quality requirements for the installation. HQ ACC/CEVQ will
   advise base managers as soon as emerging requirements are defined. Other resources base managers
   may utilize include the environmental offices of the Human Resources Center at Brooks AFB, AFC-
   ESA at Tyndall AFB, DENIX at http://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/DOD/dod.html, Federal Registers
   and other services environmental centers.
   6.5.2. Episode Planning:
       6.5.2.1. Some SIPs may require the development and implementation of a comprehensive plan
       for air pollution emergency episodes. Air pollution emergency episodes are typically ordered
       when pollution concentrations exceed established thresholds. It will be necessary to identify all
       actions the base can take without compromising the mission, yet minimizes pollution emissions.
       6.5.2.2. The Atmospheric Stagnation Advisory issued by the local National Oceanographic and
       Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather office includes the initial regulations requiring this
       emergency planning. The Environmental Flight should partner with the base Weather Squadron to
       insure timely implementation of the plan in the event this condition deteriorates to an Air Pollution
       Warning or Emergency.
   6.5.3. Conformity Planning and Requirements:
       6.5.3.1. Each state must submit to the EPA the conformity provisions within 12 months after an
       area's designation to non-attainment, whichever date is later. These conformity rules will become
       part of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and bases or operating areas (ranges) located in
       non-attainment areas must meet the conformity requirements. Conformity is the net that catches
       actions not included in (NSR) and (PSD) requirements. This rule effectively keeps federal agen-
       cies from slipping past the SIP requirement. If a federal action in a non-attainment or maintenance
       area results in total direct and indirect emissions from mobile and stationary sources exceeding the
       limits in Table 6.5., the action requires a conformity determination. Use potential to emit to arrive
       at these calculations. This is the first air law that can stop the movement of aircraft and supporting
       resources shifting through realignment to a base located in a non-attainment area.

        6.5.3.2. For ACC bases in non-attainment areas, the conformity trigger for most pollutants is 100
        tpy. Ozone transport areas are 50 tpy, lead triggers conformity at 25 tpy, and one ACC base may
        be within the PM-10 serious amount of 70 tpy. The rule governing the conformity determination
        has a large number of exemptions. Consult with ACC/CEVP for specific conformity issues.
     6.5.4. Monitoring, Record Keeping, and Reporting:
        6.5.4.1. Monitoring. All bases conform to emissions monitoring and analysis procedures or test
        methods required under Title I, Title III, Title V and or SIP requirements to include all procedures
        in the permit as prescribed.
           6.5.4.1.1. The applicable requirement may provide for periodic testing, instrumental or
           non-instrumental monitoring (which may consist of record keeping), periodic monitoring suf-
           ficient to provide reliable data from the required time period in order to meet the source's com-
           pliance with the permit.
           6.5.4.1.2. Bases use EPA accepted test methods, units and averaging periods. The Bioenvi-
           ronmental Engineer performs for "special ambient air surveys" air monitoring, mostly for
           health risk analysis, but a base may require a contractor for complex requirements such as
           stack testing for particulates. 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A contains EPA test methods.
        6.5.4.2. Recordkeeping. ACC bases reduce or simplify recordkeeping to the maximum extent
        possible. This is best achieved through effective regulatory negotiations prior to issuance of the
        Title V or other air permit. Except where explicitly required by regulation, means other than
        recordkeeping can be used to document compliance with air permit conditions. Permit compli-
        ance verification and documentation use existing records (e.g., supply transaction records or pay-
        ment/billing vouchers).
        6.5.4.3. Record keeping and monitoring may include one or more of the requirements shown at
        Table 6.6. It is important to archive the data. Individual states may provide or require their own
        record keeping forms.
        6.5.4.4. Report to HQ ACC/CEV any exceedance of major air pollutant source permits in accor-
        dance with RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)8603, Report of Notices of Violation and Noncompliance.
        6.5.4.5. Report any air permit or legal agreement exceedance to ACC/CEVQ as soon as possible.
        Report Air Permit or Legal Agreement Exceedance (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)8603, Report of
        Notices of Violation and Noncompliance and HAF-CEV(Q&AR)9417, Report of Compliance
        Agreements).

                  Retention of records for 5 years including measurement data
                  Submittal of reports every 6 months

   6.5.5. VOCs and Corrosion Control Facilities:
      6.5.5.1. Bases must use a VOC tracking system for all paints, solvents, thinner, and wipe down
      materials. This information must be maintained in ACES Environmental Module (EM) when it is
      fielded.
         6.5.5.1.1. Base air quality managers with painting operations that use the "nose dock" hanger
         approach may need to inventory and calculate the paint and solvent VOCs as fugitive emis-
         sions.
      6.5.5.2. Corrosion control facilities use fiberglass filters to reduce the emission of larger particu-
      late matter but PM-10 and VOC emissions will pass through these filters uncontrolled. Paint that
      collects on the filter surface will volatilize into the atmosphere as it dries with the same efficiency
      as an open hanger.
      6.5.5.3. There are numerous solutions to control the release of VOCs during painting and solvent
      wipe-down operations. Pollution controls technology is costly. Base Environmental Flights enter
      the requirements for required control in the ACES-PM system as a Level I requirement with a reg-
      ulatory deadline.
   6.5.6. Emissions Inventory.
      6.5.6.1. All bases that are major sources (CAA Part 172) and located in a non-attainment area as
      designated by 40 CFR Part 81 must complete an air emission inventory (AEI) annually. Bases
      review their AEI annually and update as sources and processes change. ACC/CEVQ recommends
      complete re-accomplishing of the AEI every 5 years, including mobile sources, as a minimum.
      Most bases re-accomplish the AEI annually, excluding mobile sources.
      6.5.6.2. Compliance with the SIP and Title V may require bases to complete an annual air emis-
      sions inventory (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)8603, Report of Notices of Violation and Noncompliance;
      HAF-CEV(Q&AR)9417, Report of Compliance Agreements). Post the results of all emission
      inventory data in ACES-EM air module.
   6.5.7. Risk Management Planning (RMP):
      6.5.7.1. RMP places more restrictive regulations on specified substances. Based on Section
      112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), this statute requires nearby communities to be notified of
      surrounding dangers. RMPs cover accidental release prevention requirements with the goal of
      preventing a catastrophic release of substances that could have an immediate and severe impact on
      the public or environment. The final rule regulates 77 toxic and 63 flammable substances stored
      or used in processes exceeding the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.130.
82                                 ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      6.5.7.2. Identify all substances at your facility which are or have the potential to be present in a
      process in quantities at or above the threshold quantities in 40 CFR 68.130. Table 6.7. contains
      possible toxic substances and example processes for materials known to be at Air Force bases.
      While this list is not inclusive ACC air managers can use this table as a "starter list." Also, note
      that the threshold applies to the total amount of the substance that may be found at any one time
      for a specific process, not the entire installation. For example, an installation has 1000 lb of chlo-
      rine at the wastewater plant, 1200 lb at the drinking water plant and 700 lb at the swimming pool.
      The total for the installation exceeds the chlorine threshold of 2500 lb, but the individual amounts
      do not. The rule is not applicable for chlorine at this installation. However, if the three sources are
      co-located or fed by a central tank (and the potential for simultaneous release of all three quantities
      exists), the rule applies.

      6.5.7.3. Preparedness and prevention are key to successful risk management planning. RMP
      ensures the public is educated and fully informed about the potential dangers. RMPs generally
      include a five-year accident history, a worst-case scenario, and emergency response procedures.
      The RMP submittal deadline is June 21, 1999, and the accident history must begin five years prior.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                              83


      Personnel preparing RMPs should insure the plans do not include sensitive information, such as
      information on the exact location of dangerous substances on ACC installations. Sensitive infor-
      mation could include precise locations or capabilities of sensitive military equipment or facilities.
      Descriptions of risks involving sensitive information should identify the general proximity of the
      site of the risk and should only include identification of facilities and equipment as necessary to
      generally describe the risk, the area of the risk, and the potential affects of the risk.

6.6. Clean Air Act Training and Auditing Requirements. All bases provide the essential Compliance
Training (CT), Environmental Education (EE), and Awareness Training (AT) for implementation of the
CAAA and the ACC air quality program. Review the ACC Environmental Training Handbook, 1 May
96, for guidance on training requirements.
   6.6.1. Requirements. CT requirements satisfy legal mandates and establish installation compliance.
   Installation professionals whose job responsibilities include management of air programs and ensur-
   ing the installation complies with environmental laws require EE. Shop and flight line personnel
   responsible for air emission sources require AT.
   6.6.2. Developing Training Plans:
      6.6.2.1. Training plans in ACC are aligned with permit requirements. While other training as
      explained below maybe beneficial, the base air program manager concentrates on compliance with
      training to assure compliance with the air permit.
      6.6.2.2. Environmental Education needed by air program managers at ACC bases include a gen-
      eral overview of the CAA and major titles with more specific courses covering, Title III Air Tox-
      ics, Volatile Organic Compounds and Title V Part 70 Permitting of sources. Additional training
      should concentrate on the following groups:
          6.6.2.2.1. Personnel working on the flight line and shops will need AT to raise the level of
          understanding for compliance of the CAA. The NCOIC or OIC responsible for operations that
          produce pollutants can accomplish this level of training on base. The installation Air Quality
          Program Manager may provide AT.
          6.6.2.2.2. Each base will develop an air quality training plan for personnel in charge at large
          stationary source emitters such as jet engine test facilities, corrosion control, large boilers or a
          central heat plant and large numbers of small point source emitters such as generators. This
          group should concentrate on a basic CAA overview, air requirements in the SIP and permit
          compliance.
          6.6.2.2.3. Personnel that routinely use or control the inventory of chemicals require awareness
          training and exposure to the Title III Air Toxics rules.
          6.6.2.2.4. Individuals working the transfer and storage of fuels need training that covers the
          state VOC laws, including the federal rules under 40 CFR Part 60 Subpart Kb-Standards of
          Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid Storage Vessels.
          6.6.2.2.5. Personnel working in paint booths need training on the Aerospace NESHAPs rule,
          if applicable to that base, and training on issues specific to the permit and record keeping
          requirements.
   6.6.3. Licensing:
84                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


        6.6.3.1. Personnel responsible for operating air emissions equipment that require licensing or cer-
        tification obtain the needed certification and remain current during their employment in the posi-
        tion.
        6.6.3.2. Those assigned to back-up licensed or certified positions by their job description must
        obtain and maintain the required certification. An example of a back-up position would be a
        mechanic that normally does not work on vehicle air conditioning equipment, but may be called
        on to do so during a work force emergency. ECP funds cannot pay for licensing or certification
        unless it is an integral part of training.

6.7. Special Topics.
     6.7.1. Non-road Engines:
        6.7.1.1. EPA published its regulation on control of emissions from new and in-use non-road
        engines on 17 Jun 1994 (59 FR 31335, codified at 40 CFR Part 89). Pursuant to section 89.2 of the
        regulation, a non-road engine is, "any internal combustion engine in or on a piece of equipment
        that is self-propelled or serves a dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing another
        function". Some of ACC installation's AGE equipment meet this definition, but most is trailer
        mounted and not self-propelled.
        6.7.1.2. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) is a category of tactical and portable equipment
        powered by reciprocating engines or turbine engines that operate throughout the flightline areas of
        ACC installations. Most AGE is mounted on wheeled trailers and are used in many locations dur-
        ing a given time period. Section 302(z) of the CAA excludes non-road engines as defined in Sec-
        tion 216 from the "stationary source" definition. Section 216 of the CAA defines a non-road
        engine as an internal combustion engine that is, (1) not used in a motor vehicle, (2) not used in a
        sports vehicle, and (3) that is not regulated by Sections 111 or 202. The 40 CFR 89.2 definition for
        non-road engines models the Section 216 definition. CAA section 112(a)(3) defines "stationary
        source" the same as section 111(a)(3) and exempts non-road engines and therefore internal com-
        bustion AGE from the stationary source definition. Hence, internal combustion AGE is not a sta-
        tionary source. However, turbine AGE may have to be included. Air quality managers should
        consult with HQ ACC/CEVQ prior to including any AGE in an air permit as a stationary source.
        There may be some reasonable arguments which can be made for "tactical" AGE, or that portion
        of the installations inventory which exist only to support tactical deployed mission requirements.
        6.7.1.3. It is ACC's opinion that AGE is not a stationary source subject to the purview of Title V
        and emissions data should not be included in Title V permit applications. If the base has been
        advised otherwise, or knows that the state holds a contrary position, please contact HQ ACC/
        CEVQ before seeking clarification with regulator agencies.
     6.7.2. Crash Fire Rescue Training Facilities:
        6.7.2.1. Some fire training pits require a construction permit as an air emission source and an
        operating permit. However, states may allow exemptions, specifically exempting all fire training
        activities from permitting. Check your state SIP or talk with your regulator about changes in oper-
        ations that alter emissions. If your facility is exempt obtain a letter from the regulatory agency to
        document your status.
        6.7.2.2. Even if the fire training area is exempt this does not mean propane operation emissions
        are exempt from annual emissions inventory. Additionally, local restrictions may regulate burn
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         85


     periods in length and time of day, opacity of smoke emissions and the types of agents used to
     extinguish the fire.
  6.7.3. Aerospace NESHAPs.
     6.7.3.1. The US EPA promulgated the Aerospace National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air
     Pollutants (NESHAP) in the Federal Register (60 FR 45948) on 1 Sep 95. Title 40 Part 63 Subpart
     GG of the Code of Federal Regulations contains the regulations. Many ACC installations will be
     subject to this rule.
     6.7.3.2. Applicability:
        6.7.3.2.1. Subpart GG applies to facilities that engage, either in part or in whole, in the manu-
        facture or rework of commercial, civil, or military aerospace vehicles or components and that
        are major hazardous air pollutant sources as defined by 40 CFR 63. Currently, no ACC base is
        subject to this rule due to the achievement of area source status for HAPs. ACC provides this
        information as good pollution prevention measures in addition to possible future applicability.
        6.7.3.2.2. The ACC processes affected by this rule include: all hand-wipe operations; each
        spray gun cleaning operations; all flush cleaning operations; all primer operations; all topcoat
        applications; all depainting operations; all chemical maskant application processes; all waste
        handling and storage operations.
        6.7.3.2.3. The requirements of this NESHAP apply only to operations at a facility associated
        with the manufacturing and rework of aerospace vehicles and components. ACC bases qualify
        as rework facilities. There is one exception, the requirements pertaining to cleaning solvents
        apply to each cleaning operation unless the operation is individually exempt from specific
        requirements.
     6.7.3.3. Compliance Deadline. As provided for in the General Provisions, applicable sources
     must be in compliance by 1 Sep 98. ACC installations must maintain the appropriate documenta-
     tion to demonstrate compliance with the rule.
     6.7.3.4. Standards. The standards for compliance with the Aerospace NESHAP differ depending
     on the specific process involved. To assist managers, a summary of some of the key standards fol-
     lows:
        6.7.3.4.1. Hand-wipe Cleaning Operations Standards. Except for spray gun and flush
        cleaning, all HAP or VOC hand-wipe cleaning solvents must meet a composition requirement,
        have a vapor pressure less than 45 mm Hg at 20 ×C, or meet the requirements specified in an
        alternative compliance plan administered by the permitting authority. ACC policy is to use
        solvents that meet this composition requirement.
        6.7.3.4.2. Recordkeeping Requirements. Each applicable major source must comply with
        parts of Section 40 CFR 63.10. ACC recommends major sources work closely with the regu-
        latory agency to determine what recordkeeping requirements apply. Ideally, the major source
        can negotiate to make these recordkeeping requirements and the Title V permit recordkeeping
        requirements the same.
        6.7.3.4.3. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations. For uncontrolled primers the
        organic HAP content limit is 350 g/l as applied or 2.9 lb/gal less water. The VOC content limit
        is 350 g/l or 2.9 lb/gal less water and exempt solvents as applied. Operators may achieve com-
86                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


            pliance through use of coatings below content limits, or use of monthly volume-weighted
            averaging to meet content limits (See 40 CFR 63.745(e)). ACC policy is to use primers and
            topcoats meeting this composition requirement, or having fewer emissions.
            6.7.3.4.4. For controlled primers and topcoats, the control system must capture and control all
            emissions from the application operation and achieve an overall control efficiency of at least
            81%. This means capture 90% and control 90% to achieve the overall efficiency of 81%.
            ACC policy is to install control systems meeting this requirement or better where cost analysis
            indicates.
            6.7.3.4.5. ACC standard for application is HVLP or electrostatic spray application or other
            method producing fewer emissions.
            6.7.3.4.6. For ACC most painting operations use the HVLP or electrostatic spray application
            techniques. Touch up with the primer pen and use of rollers, brushes and airbrushes are also
            approved and recommended for specific situations. Always use the method resulting in the
            lease emissions while still meeting mission requirements.
            6.7.3.4.7. Depainting Operations. The standard applies to the outer surface of aircraft vehi-
            cles. It does not apply to parts or units normally removed. The fuselage, wings, and stabilizers
            always are in place. Radomes or other similar devices or parts normally removed are exempt.
            6.7.3.4.8. Unless exempted, chemical strippers or softeners cannot emit any organic HAPs.
            Fifty gallons of organic HAP-containing strippers for spot stripping and decal removal per air-
            craft per year for all military aircraft types is the maximum allowed.
            6.7.3.4.9. Planning for Compliance. Base environmental managers consult with their per-
            mitting authority and develop appropriate compliance strategies. The first choice strategy is
            use of compliant paints and solvents.
                6.7.3.4.9.1. Other strategies include changing the painting process procedure, as well as a
                change in the types of paints used, where the painting occurs, or a combination of all of
                these to achieve full compliance. Bases must identify facility modification or equipment
                requirements and forward funds requests through the ACES-PM system to HQ ACC/
                CEVQ for ECP funds validation. It is important to provide specific regulatory requirement
                in the justification field of the ACES-PM project narrative to minimize delays in the vali-
                dation process.
            6.7.3.4.10. Facility minor construction modifications that exceed $500,000 require MILCON
            programming which can take several years. (See Chapter 13.) Base environmental managers
            work closely with their base engineering and headquarters ACC facility programmers to
            insure timely, well-planned MILCON projects.
     6.7.4. Military Unique Sources. State or federal agencies may exempt or waiver specific military
     unique sources for equipment or procedures used for military only applications. Each base should
     regularly attend public hearings held by State agencies concerning development of regulations that
     may adversely impact Air Force operations. A typical example of this type of regulation is the possi-
     ble exemption of AGE for purposes of Title V (See paragraph 6.8.1.). These exemptions are often
     negotiated at the state level.
     6.7.5. Potential To Emit Emission Estimates for Emergency Electrical Generators:
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                            87


     6.7.5.1. The EPA published a "white paper" 6 Sep 95 that addressed the estimation of PTE for
     emergency electrical generators. The EPA states an "emergency generator" means "a generator
     whose sole function is to provide back-up power when electric power from the local utility is
     interrupted." Emergency electrical generators at ACC bases fit this definition.
         6.7.5.1.1. The EPA further states, "that generators devoted to emergency uses are clearly con-
         strained in their operation, in the sense that, by definition and design, they are used only during
         periods where electric power from public utilities is unavailable".
         6.7.5.1.2. Two factors indicate that this constraint is in fact inherent. First, while the com-
         bined period for such power outages during any one year will vary somewhat, a base can esti-
         mate an upper bound that never to be exceeded unless extraordinary circumstances occur.
         Second, the duration of these outages is entirely beyond the control of the source, and when
         they do occur (except in the case of a major catastrophe) rarely last more than a day.
     6.7.5.2. For the purpose of estimating PTE for emergency generators, use a reasonable and realis-
     tic "worst case" estimate for the number of hours power is unavailable from the local utility when
     identifying "maximum capacity".
         6.7.5.2.1. EPA does not recommend the use of 8760 hours per year (i.e., full-year operation)
         for calculating the PTE for emergency generators.
         6.7.5.2.2. Instead, EPA recommends potential to emit estimates be based upon an estimate of
         the maximum amount of hours the generator could operate, taking into account the number of
         hours power is unavailable, and the number of hours for maintenance activities.
     6.7.5.3. The EPA believes that 500 hours is an appropriate default assumption for estimating the
     number of hours that an emergency generator operates under worst-case conditions. You can
     make alternative estimates on a case-by-case basis where justified by the source owner or permit-
     ting authority.
     6.7.5.4. For ACC bases, estimate PTE for electrical emergency generators using the 500 hours
     indicated above.
  6.7.6. Fiberglass Emission Regulations. HQ EPA is in the process of gathering technical data for a
  new standard for the manufacture of fiberglass. It will include attenuation manufacturing techniques
  and will consolidate applicable regulations governing fiberglass manufacturing. There are no current
  regulations that require fiberglass emissions to be included in air emission statements or inventories.
  6.7.7. Gasoline Pumps.
     6.7.7.1. For "wholesale purchaser-consumer" (40 CFR 80.22(o)) that handles over 10,000 gallons
     of gasoline or methanol, not diesel, per month, pumps must be equipped with devices to limit flow
     to a maximum of 10 gallons per minute by 1 Jul 1996 (58 Federal Register 16019, 24 Mar 1993).
     6.7.7.2. On a typical ACC base, wholesale purchaser-customers include AAFES stations and mil-
     itary gas stations. Environmental Compliance funding may be used for installation of flow limit-
     ing devices for military gas stations that handle over 10,000 gallons of gasoline or methanol.
     Funding for AAFES stations is in accordance with AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of
     Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities and AFI 32-1022,
     Planning and Programming NAF Facility Construction Projects.

6.8. Emission Credits.
     6.8.1. Air Emission Reduction Credits (ERC):
        6.8.1.1. Coordinate all purchases and trades of air emissions credits, internal to DoD or with the
        private sector, through HQ ACC/CEV and AFCEE's regional compliance office prior to the start
        of contracting actions.
        6.8.1.2. Sources may trade emission reduction credits earned by a source that reduces its emis-
        sions beyond its reduction requirements. ERCs are federal property and disposed of according to
        the appropriate federal property disposal regulations. Reductions of flying operations do not yield
        ERCs. The following references provide additional information:

           Vest and Mr. James F. Boatright, May 5, 1993.

           6.8.1.2.5. Emissions Trading Policy, Part 51, Federal Register 43830, Dec 4, 1985.
     6.8.2. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Emission Credits:
        6.8.2.1. Title I and Title V of the CAA in addition to 40 CFR regulates VOC emissions. Part 60,
        Standards of Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid Storage Vessels. The SIP will break out
        VOC emissions under a separate title with regulations for particular processes such as surface
        coating, solvent usage, combustion sources or cutback asphalt operations.
        6.8.2.2. A typical ACC base releases VOCs through the operations of corrosion control, solvent
        wipe down operations, jet engine test cell operations, fuel evaporation, aerospace ground equip-
        ment and chemical usage. Fuels release a large quantity of VOCs during storage and transfer
        operations.
        6.8.2.3. The change to JP-8 fuel from JP-4 dramatically reduced the amount of VOCs emitted into
        the atmosphere from ACC base operations. The vapor pressure of JP-4 or jet naphtha is 1.6
        (pounds per square inch at atmospheric pressure) at 70 ×F, while the vapor pressure of JP-8 or jet
        kerosene is only .011 psi at the same temperature. Selected ACC bases may be able to get credit
        for the VOC reduction associated with the fuel switch. Maintain the documented reduction in the
        base air emission inventory.
     6.8.3. ERC Identification:
        6.8.3.1. ERCs may result from operational changes at the base such as fuel or chemical changes,
        removal of pollution emitting equipment, installation or pollution control equipment, pollution
        prevention techniques, base realignment or closure action. Check your SIP for requirements
        applicable to your Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) or Air Quality District (AQD) and the sell-
        ing of credits. If realignment or closure actions affect your base, conduct a complete air emissions
        inventory within the following time frames:
           6.8.3.1.1. At a closure base: Within one year or as early as possible prior to the departure of
           the active mission.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           89


          6.8.3.1.2. Where there is no longer an active mission. Immediately.
          6.8.3.1.3. Where the base discontinued equipment emitting air emissions. Within one year or
          as early as possible.
          6.8.3.1.4. For future closures. Within 6 months of a base closure announcement, complete an
          inventory of all existing/potential sources of ERCs and prepare a legal review summarizing
          applicable AQD regulations on ERCs.
      6.8.3.2. Send emissions inventory and legal review for the ERCs to HQ ACC/CEV and the appro-
      priate RCO.
   6.8.4. ERC Application. A base may apply for ERCs as required by the regulatory agency after
   determining the installation can meet requirements and has adequate funds, as necessary. Coordinate
   any plans for ERC applications with HQ ACC/CEV prior to application processing.

6.9. Base-Level Air Quality Compliance.
   6.9.1. Reporting (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)8603, Report of Notices of Violation and Noncompliance;
   RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)9420, Air Program Overview, Emission Sources and Permits). Compliance
   reporting for permits begins after the Title V permits are in place. Any noncompliance reported to the
   enforcement agency must also be reported to ACC/CEV at the same time. As part of the ESORTS
   program permit and legal agreement compliance of the air program are measured.
   6.9.2. Objective. Any permit or legal agreement exceedance must be reported to ACC/CEVQ as
   soon as possible. Details of the incident or occurrence should be included in the report. Reports to the
   Command air program manager can be accomplished by e-mail, phone, FAX, or through any other
   quick reporting mechanism. The true measure of air management effectiveness for any air quality
   program operation is permit compliance and reduced or eliminated emissions, while continuing to
   fully support the mission.
   6.9.3. Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) and Pollution Prevention:
      6.9.3.1. Information on the ODS federal regulations is in CAA sections 608 and 609, at 40 CFR
      Part 82. For an in depth discussion of refrigerant recycling, check the Federal Registers, Vol. 57,
      No. 135, July 14, 1992, and Vol., 58, No. 92 May 14, 1993. Contract managers may wish to read
      Public Law P.L. 102-484 Sec. 326, Elimination of use of Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances in
      Certain Military Procurement Contracts.
      6.9.3.2. It is Air Force policy to eliminate the use of Class I Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS)
      in all Air Force procurements. This applies to all contracts awarded or modified on or after 1 Jun
      1993 by Air Force contracting activities.
          6.9.3.2.1. Contracts may not include any specification, standard, drawing, or other document
          that requires the use of a Class I ODS in the design, manufacture, test, operation, or mainte-
          nance of any system, subsystem, item, component, or process.
          6.9.3.2.2. Contracts may not include any specification, standard, drawing or other document
          that establishes a requirement that can only be met by the use of a Class I ODS.
          6.9.3.2.3. Contracts may not require the delivery of any item of supply that contains a Class I
          ODS or any service that includes the use of a Class I ODS (Office of the Under Secretary of
          Defense, Washington, DC 21 May 93 Memorandum, Elimination of Ozone-Depleting Sub-

        stances, and Secretary of the Air Force Letter 7 Jan 93, Air Force Ban on Purchases of Ozone
        Depleting Chemicals (ODCs) - Action Memorandum).
        6.9.3.2.4. This policy applies to all Air Force, Reserve, Air National Guard, and Government
        Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) activities, and equipment, systems and products
        acquired by contract.
        6.9.3.2.5. The policy was effective 1 Jan 93, and includes the following ODCs:
            6.9.3.2.5.1. Halons. 1211, 1301, 1201, and 1011 are primarily fire fighting agents. Halon
            2402 is a component of vector control in some missile systems.
            6.9.3.2.5.2. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 11, 12, 113, 114, 115, 13, 111, 112, 211, 212,
            213, 214, 215, 216, and 217. The primary uses are as refrigerants and cleaning solvents.
            6.9.3.2.5.3. Other Controlled Substances. Carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform
            are primarily cleaning solvents. Methyl Bromide is a pesticide and fumigant.
     6.9.3.3. Halon Management Plan. A Halon Management Plan is required for all bases. Engi-
     neering Technical Letter (ETL) 95-1, Halon 1301 Management Planning Guidance, includes a
     sample management plan outline and the approach to managing Halon 1301 can be used for man-
     aging any halon. ETL 95-1 also contains procedures for turning in excess halon, procedures for
     identifying all halon on an installation, and procedures for determining a sufficient backup stock
     level.
        6.9.3.3.1. Other Halon Requirements. In addition to a base Halon Management Plan, HQ
        ACC requires:
            6.9.3.3.1.1. All facility fire suppression systems be placed on manual operation. In build-
            ings with sprinkler fire suppression systems, the halon cylinders must be removed. In
            buildings without sprinklers, with the exception of the electronics area, the halon system
            remains in manual mode until a sprinkler system is in place.
            6.9.3.3.1.2. In buildings with sprinklers throughout, including the electronics areas,
            remove the halon cylinders (ACC/CES/ESO Memorandum 11 Dec 95, Halon Manage-
            ment Plan).
            6.9.3.3.1.3. Leak test halon tanks semi-annually. Guidance on testing requirements and
            procedures is in the Mar 96 A-Gram published by HQ AFCESA (HQ ACC/CEV Memo-
            randum 14 May 96, Halon 1301 and Halon 1211 Guidance).
            6.9.3.3.1.4. Use halon portable fire extinguishers only in mission critical applications.
            Mission critical application is 150-pound flight line extinguishers supporting parked air-
            craft or hand-held extinguishers physically located on large frame aircraft. The Halon
            Management Plan documents the strategy to replace all other halon extinguishers (HQ
            ACC/CEV Memorandum 14 May 96).
            6.9.3.3.1.5. Remove Halon 1211 from fire fighting vehicles. It is not sufficient to deacti-
            vate the halon systems. Rremove the halon and transfer it to proper cylinders (HQ USAF/
            CE Policy 18 May 92, Air Force Policy of the Acquisition and Use of Halon 1211).
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         91


            6.9.3.3.1.6. A maintenance plan for halon recharge/recovery equipment and a mainte-
            nance log (HQ USAF/CEV Memorandum 7 Mar 96, Air Force Audit on Ozone Depleting
            Substances).
            6.9.3.3.1.7. The AF has a continuing requirement for Halon 1301 for F-16 aircraft. The
            overall goal is removal of Halon 1301 from all facilities and banking of the product in the
            ODS Strategic Reserves in Richmond, VA are to support long-term F-16 strategic require-
            ments.
            6.9.3.3.1.8. For non-combat missions, drain and purge Halon 1301 from F-16 fuel tank
            inerting systems. NOTE: F-16s flying contingency/combat missions will have fully
            charged Halon 1301 systems).
  6.9.4. Mobile Sources. HQ ACC/CEVQ adopts and enforces policies and guidance from HQ ACC/
  LGTV covering the operation of mobile sources. HQ ACC/LG-EM acts as the point of coordination
  for logistics personnel relative to environmental matters.
     6.9.4.1. Transportation Incentives. Employers in non-attainment areas as defined by the Clean
     Air Act designated "severe" or "extreme" for ozone, or "serious" for carbon monoxide, must
     implement trip reduction programs. The Federal Employee Clean Air Incentives Act (FECAIA)
     authorizes incentives to encourage programs for employees to commute to work by means other
     than single-occupancy motor vehicles. Transportation incentives under FECAIA include transit
     passes, special parking spaces, facilities or services for bicyclists, and other non-monetary incen-
     tives. Installation commanders may voluntarily pay incentives, not required by law, from
     accounts other than environmental compliance. All transportation incentives are limited to "tran-
     sit passes" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. Section 132(f).
     6.9.4.2. Installations do not provide cash reimbursements directly or indirectly through allotments
     to military or civilian personnel. ACC currently has no major installations in areas with manda-
     tory trip reduction program implementation. Base environmental managers who believe their
     installation may have a transportation incentive obligation should contact HQ ACC/CEVQ to dis-
     cuss compliance options.

                                     CLEAN WATER ACT (CWA)

7.1. General Requirements.
     7.1.1. Responsibilities.
        7.1.1.1. HQ ACC/CEVQM, Environmental Quality Branch, Media Section, is responsible for:
        validation of ECP funds for environmental wastewater and storm water requirements; preparation
        of Command wastewater environmental policy and advocating for environmental wastewater pro-
        grams ensure ACC installations achieve and maintain full compliance with state and federal CWA
        regulations.
        7.1.1.2. The base installation environmental wastewater program manager is responsible for iden-
        tifying existing environmental wastewater deficiencies, new requirements, and to ensure full com-
        pliance with state and federal CWA derived regulations. Obtain all required permits and fully
        comply with the regulatory requirements of the CWA as promulgated through EPA and state reg-
        ulations. Non-compliant requirements are identified and programmed via ACES-PM for EC and
        CTP2 funding eligibility. Wastewater and storm water data is maintained in ACES-EM (once EM
        water modules have been implemented and are operational). Base level programs must represent
        logical progression and appropriate facility approval levels in planning a base-wide CWA correc-
        tive actions program. ACC base environmental wastewater program managers must be familiar
        with the CWA and associated regulations to ensure full compliance. Careful monitoring of permit
        parameters as well as being familiar with base activities effecting wastewater is critical for effec-
        tive base level management. Responsibilities for the storm water pollution prevention plan are
        identified at paragraph 7.4. of this manual.
     7.1.2. Policy Guidance.
        7.1.2.1. See AFI 32-1067, Water Systems, for Air Force guidance on wastewater programs.
        7.1.2.2. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-500), bet-
        ter known as the CWA, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., is the primary federal statute. The objective of the
        Act is "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's
        waters." The Water Quality Act of 1987 and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 are significant amend-
        ments impacting compliance requirements.
        7.1.2.3. The EPA published definition for secondary treatment as amended in 1985 and further
        defined in 40 CFR 133, 27 Jan 1989, includes the three major effluent parameters shown in Table
        7.1.

Table 7.1. Secondary Treatment Standards.

                Suspended Solids      30 mg/L                              45 mg/L
                pH                    Within 6.0 to 9.0 at all times
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           93


       7.1.2.4. The law sets performance standards, which is enforced through a permit program. There
       are two primary types of regulatory controls: water quality standards and technology based stan-
       dards.
           7.1.2.4.1. Water Quality Standards. Water quality standards describe permissible in-stream
           concentrations of various parameters (such as dissolved oxygen and dissolved solids). These
           standards for water quality vary depending on the use of the water.
           7.1.2.4.2. Technology-based Standards. Technology-based standards focus on the method
           used to treat effluent before it is introduced into a water of the United States. While most ACC
           bases have had technology based standards in their discharge permits, the trend is to issue per-
           mit renewals based on water quality standards. Water quality based standards are often several
           orders of magnitude lower than technology based standards. For this reason, timely review of
           permit renewal applications and draft permits by CEV and JAV are more critical than ever.
   7.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter shall be
   requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
   provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
   sound engineering and/or environmental practices that maintain environmental compliance.
   7.1.4. Applicability:
       7.1.4.1. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations, ANG, and
       AFRES units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing commander.
       Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordination
       with the host installation.
       7.1.4.2. This guidance does not apply to ACC installations located in foreign countries. For envi-
       ronmental compliance at ACC OCONUS installations and operations, use the more stringent of
       the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), Treaty, DoD Instructions, or Final Governing
       Standards (FGS). If there are local or host nation regulations not covered by these documents,
       then the base shall request HQ ACC/CEV conduct a case-by-case determination.

7.2. Permits. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is the national pro-
gram for issuing, modifying, revoking and reissuing, terminating, monitoring and enforcing permits, and
imposing and enforcing pretreatment requirements, under sections 307, 402, 318, and 405 of the CWA.
The permit is issued by the state or EPA and allows the installation to discharge pollutants in specified
amounts or concentrations into the waters of the United States. ACC installations which discharge pollut-
ants (See paragraph 7.2.2.1.1.) from any point source (see paragraph 7.2.2.1.2.) into water of the United
States require a NPDES permit (See 40 CFR 122.1). It is ACC policy to obtain all required permits and
fully comply with the regulatory requirements of the CWA as promulgated through EPA and state regula-
tions.
   7.2.1. Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). The CWA requires a permit to discharge from
   WWTPs into waters of the United States. The regional EPA office issues permits unless there is an
   approved state program. States which have EPA-approved status have been delegated NPDES author-
   ity and must comply with at least the same requirements as the federal program. A NPDES permit
   will typically be for five years.
   7.2.2. Wastewater Collection Systems:
94                               ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


     7.2.2.1. The CWA makes it unlawful for any person to discharge any pollutant from a point
     source into navigable waters without a permit (see CWA 301(a)). A person can be any individual,
     a corporation, a state, municipality, the military, etc.
        7.2.2.1.1. Pollutants are broadly defined to include "dredged soil, solid waste, incinerator res-
        idue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials,
        radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and indus-
        trial, municipal and agricultural waste..." (CWA 502(6)).
        7.2.2.1.2. A point source is "any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance" (CWA
        502(14)) to include any pipe, channel, tunnel, ditch, conduit, or well. NPDES permits are not
        required for discharges to Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), to privately owned
        treatment works with NPDES permits or to Federally Owned Treatment Works (FOTW), how-
        ever, pre-treatment standards may apply.
     7.2.2.2. Permits must be applied for at least 180 days before the date on which the discharge is to
     begin or before the existing permit to lapse. However, states may have stricter requirements. In
     addition owners or operators of any proposed facility, which may be a new source of discharge,
     must apply for a permit prior to construction of the facility.
     7.2.2.3. Before a permit may be issued there must be a public notice and comment period and an
     opportunity for a public hearing. The public notice is made by the permitting authority. ACC
     installation environmental managers will consult with ACC/CEV/JAV and AFCEE/REO offices
     to prepare substantive comments on proposed permits during the public comment period.
     7.2.2.4. The basic contents of a permit application include: a listing of all federal and state envi-
     ronmental permits or construction approvals; information describing the discharge, including out-
     fall locations; each process that contributes wastewater to effluent; and a facility production
     description of the characteristics of the effluent. The facility description must include analytical
     data for constituents in the effluent.
     7.2.2.5. NPDES.
        7.2.2.5.1. For ACC bases with NPDES permits, Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) are
        submitted monthly to the permitting agency or as required by the permit . Copies of all corre-
        spondence relevant to the permit including DMRs and permit renewals shall be provided to
        HQ ACC/CEVQM at the same time they are submitted to the regulating agency (RCS:
        HAF-CEV(Q&AR)9417, Report of Compliance Agreements). When operational, ACES-EM
        shall be used to fulfill this reporting requirement to HQ ACC/CEVQ.
        7.2.2.5.2. Each base monitors and records the amount of pollutants present in its effluent.
        DMRs are used by regulatory agencies to check compliance with the NPDES permit. It is very
        important that each DMR is reviewed for accuracy prior to submittal.
     7.2.2.6. Installation environmental flights notify ACC/CEVQM of any known exceedance docu-
     mented in the DMR (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)8603, Report of Notices of Violation and Non-compli-
     ance; RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)9421, Water and Wastewater Programs and Inventories).
     7.2.2.7. If the exceedance may endanger health or the environment it must be provided orally
     within 24 hours to the agency who issued the permit and HQ ACC/CEVQM at the time the base
     becomes aware of the circumstance. See Chapter 11 for whether the exceedance could be an
     ACC reportable release.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                              95


  7.2.3. Regulated industrial activities are listed by categories in 40 CFR 122.26(b)(i-xi). For catego-
  ries listed in 122.26(b)(i-x), a permit is required regardless of the actual exposure of materials or activ-
  ities to storm water. For category listed in 122.26(b)(xi), facilities are required to obtain a permit only
  if materials/activities are exposed to storm water discharge.
  7.2.4. Storm Water Types of Permits:
     7.2.4.1. The Phase I storm water program caused significant improvement of U.S. surface water
     quality by reducing polluted runoff from industrial activities, large- and medium-sized city storm
     sewer systems, and construction sites larger than 5 acres. Permit application requirements for
     storm water vary according to the NPDES permitting authority and the specific situation of the
     facility. All ACC bases are classified as "industrial" due to the flying mission, their supporting
     maintenance operations, and other industrial activities.
     7.2.4.2. The Phase II Storm water program expands the Phase I program by requiring Municipal
     Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s) in Urban Areas (50,000 people and 1,000 people per
     square mile) and small construction sites (Between 1 and 5 acres) use NPDES permits to imple-
     ment programs to control storm water runoff. These permits will be required for all urban areas
     and small construction projects by March 2003. In addition to permit requirements, storm water
     discharge management controls (Best Management Practices) must be implemented (See Federal
     Register 8 December 1999).
     7.2.4.3. Three types of permitting options exist for industrial storm water permits: individual,
     general, and the multi-sector general. Permit application deadlines for individual, baseline gen-
     eral, and multi-sector general have all passed.
         7.2.4.3.1. Both Federal and State regulatory agencies offer the individual permit. It is
         renewed at least every five years and may require sampling at each rainfall event.
         7.2.4.3.2. Both Federal and State regulatory agencies also offered the baseline general permit,
         which expired 1 Sep 1997. Sampling is either annual or semi-annual and enforcement poten-
         tial is retroactive.
         7.2.4.3.3. The multi-sector general permit is offered by Federal regulatory agencies only. It
         was effective 1 Sep 95, is renewed every five years, and requires quarterly sampling.
     7.2.4.4. All ACC bases applied for the Group (multi-sector) permit (See Federal Register 29 Sep
     95). Many ACC bases opted out of the group permit and now have individual or baseline general
     permits.
     7.2.4.5. All permit applications for coverage of storm water only require a certification that an
     evaluation be completed for non-storm water discharges, and that these discharges do not exist.
     NPDES storm water permits do not authorize non-storm water discharges; however, an individual
     NPDES permit may authorize non-storm water discharge. If a facility cannot complete this certi-
     fication, they must explain why it was not feasible to complete the investigation. If a facility is
     aware of non-storm water discharges, they must eliminate the discharge or seek individual permit
     coverage for the discharge.
     7.2.4.6. Individual Permits:
         7.2.4.6.1. Individual permits are facility specific and involve completion of either EPA Forms
         or state specific forms. Federal EPA forms are listed in Table 7.2.
96                                 ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


Table 7.2. Federal EPA Forms.
               Form                                           Applicability
     EPA Forms 1 and 2F             Storm water only
     EPA Forms 1, 2C and 2F         Storm water and process wastewater
     EPA Forms 1, 2C and 2E         Storm water and non-process wastewater
     EPA Forms 1, 2D and 2F         New source composed of storm water and non-storm water

         7.2.4.6.2. EPA Form 1 is purely an administrative form. Forms 2C, 2D, 2E, and 2F require
         listing of the specific outfalls and testing of specific pollutants according to the particular
         industry or whether or not the pollutant has the potential to come in contact with storm water.
         7.2.4.6.3. Forms and instruction are contained in EPA Publication Guidance Manual for the
         Preparation of NPDES Permit Applications for Storm water Discharges Associated with
         Industrial Activity, Apr 91.
         7.2.4.6.4. The individual permit avenue is typically the most stringent type of permit because
         effluent limitations are typically imposed and monitoring requirements are more frequent. An
         individual permit is the only type of permit at this time that has effluent limitations for outfalls.
         Individual permits are typically issued by regulators, where the state has NPDES authority.
         These permits require preparation of a Storm water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).
      7.2.4.7. General Permits:
         7.2.4.7.1. General permits require a facility to complete a Notice of Intent (NOI) form (or
         state equivalent form) which is similar to the EPA Form 1. Often upon completion and sub-
         mission of the form to the state or EPA, the facility is automatically covered by the general
         permit. Some NPDES authorities have one baseline general permit that applies to all appli-
         cants, yet others have industry specific permits already in place.
         7.2.4.7.2. The general permit avenue is an attractive option for the EPA/state and the permit-
         tee. The general permit lessens the administrative burden on the regulators because several
         industries are under one permit. The permittee is not under effluent limitations (except indus-
         tries classified as coal pile industry, which limits total suspended solids and pH) under the gen-
         eral permit, and may have fewer obligations under the monitoring requirements.
         7.2.4.7.3. General permits require development of a Storm water Pollution Prevention Plan
         (SWPPP). The purpose of the SWPPP is to complete an assessment of the facility for potential
         pollutant sources and to establish Best Management Practices (BMPs) to eliminate/manage
         pollutants from getting into storm water. The SWPPP under EPA's general permit must be
         complete and on file within six months of submission of the NOI and implemented within one
         year of submission of the NOI.
         7.2.4.7.4. EPA does not require that the SWPPP be submitted, however, the SWPPP is a pub-
         lic document and may be reviewed by EPA at any time. If the state has NPDES authority,
         however, the state may require that the SWPPP be submitted for approval and may have more
         stringent deadlines for development and implementation.

         7.2.4.7.5. Storm water construction permits are a separate type of storm water general permit.
         For any land disturbance construction activity greater than five acres, a storm water general
         permit is required for that construction operation. The application process is the same for
         industrial permits in that a NOI is required. Deadline for NOI submission to the regulating
         authority is 48 hours prior to construction start.
            7.2.4.7.5.1. The construction storm water permit requires a Storm Water Pollution Preven-
            tion Plan (SWPPP), and the primary focus of the plan is for the contractor to comply with
            measures to lessen the sediment load on storm water runoff and prevent potential erosion.
            The contractor is required to be a co-signer with the Air Force on the NOI as he is in con-
            trol of the day-to-day operations of the site. Air Force projects must incorporate in the
            construction specifications that the contractor must sign the NOI and prepare, implement,
            and train his personnel to comply with the SWPPP for his site.
         7.2.4.7.6. Non-storm water discharges which are authorized under EPA general permits
         include: flows which originate from fire fighting activities (not aqueous film forming foam
         (AFFF)); fire hydrant flushings; potable water sources, including waterline flushings; irriga-
         tion drainage (not irrigation water from waste water treatment plant effluent); lawn watering;
         routine external building washdown without detergents; pavement washwaters where spills/
         leaks of toxic or hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spilled material has been
         removed) and where detergents are not used; air conditioning condensate; springs; uncontam-
         inated groundwater; and foundation/footing drains where flows are not contaminated with pro-
         cess materials such as solvents. NPDES states may restrict this list and not allow some of
         these discharges to be authorized. In either case, all non-storm water discharges must be listed
         in the SWPPP.
      7.2.4.8. Group Application and the Multi-Sector Permit:
         7.2.4.8.1. The group application was not actually a type of permit but merely an application
         avenue. The group application option was initiated in the 16 Nov 90 Federal Register. The
         idea of the group application was to reduce the amount of applicants and also allow facilities
         with similar operations apply as a group. The Air Force submitted the AF Storm water Group
         Application to the EPA in late Sep 92.
         7.2.4.8.2. The group application consists of Part I (administrative information similar to the
         EPA Form 1 but includes topographic maps showing drainage areas and outfalls, characteriza-
         tion of outfalls, and base location). Part II of the application requires sampling data from at
         least 10% of the group to characterize the industry. Although EPA had hoped that the number
         of group applications would be a manageable number, they received over 1,200 applications.
         About 75% of these applicants were approved. The EPA then decided to write one multi-sec-
         tor permit for all applicants rather than writing separate permits for each group applicant.
         7.2.4.8.3. The permit was to be issued to the NPDES authorities by 1 Oct 93. The multi-sec-
         tor permit was finalized and became effective on 29 Sep 95. A notice of intent to stay under
         the multi-sector permit needed to have been sent to the regulatory authority by 30 Dec 95. The
         permit has been reissued and a new NOI needed to have been sent to the regulatory authority
         by 20 Jan 2001.

7.3. Wastewater Treatment.
98                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


     7.3.1. Wastewater Treatment Plant:
        7.3.1.1. If a WWTP treatment system fails, which is typically called an "upset", or during mainte-
        nance the WWTP system is "by-passed", effluent discharge limits may be exceeded. It is impor-
        tant that operators document all upsets and bypasses. Proof of an upset or bypass can be a defense
        from an enforcement action conducted by a regulatory agency.
        7.3.1.2. An upset is considered an exceptional incident in which there is an unintentional and tem-
        porary noncompliance with technology-based effluent limitations, due to factors beyond the rea-
        sonable control of the base. (See 40 CFR 122.41(n)). A bypass is the intentional diversion of
        waste streams from any portion of the treatment facility.
     7.3.2. Wastewater Distribution Systems.
        7.3.2.1. Inflow:
           7.3.2.1.1. Each ACC base should identify and prepare projects to repair sanitary sewer distri-
           bution systems where excessive inflow exists caused by failed piping or other problems.
           7.3.2.1.2. Inflow is storm water that rapidly enters sanitary sewers through illicit roof and area
           drain connections, storm sewer cross-connections, defects in sewer lines, and manholes and
           manhole covers. Inflow is characterized by rapid and significant increases in peak sewage
           flow rates that roughly corresponds in intensity and duration to measured rain events. The
           problems caused by inflow include the bypassing of raw sewage from surcharging gravity
           sewer manholes and overloaded lift stations, as well as hydraulic capacity and treatment effi-
           ciency problems at the wastewater treatment plant.
           7.3.2.1.3. The most important single parameter used in assessing the impact of inflow is the
           Peak Inflow Rate. This is the maximum sewage flow rate in gallons per hour measured in a
           specific segment of sewer line during a rain event of a specified duration and intensity, minus
           the average baseline sewage flow rate typical for that segment.
           7.3.2.1.4. A second important parameter used to evaluate inflow is the Peaking Factor. The
           peaking factor is the maximum hourly flow rate divided by the average hourly flow rate. It
           represents the relative magnitude of flow rate increase in a specific line segment between dry
           weather conditions and maximum inflow conditions.
           7.3.2.1.5. When a lift station or wastewater treatment plant collection system as a whole is
           experiencing problems caused by excessively high peak flow rates, the peak inflow rates from
           specific areas within the collection system can be used to rank the relative benefit in peak flow
           rate reduction. This can be achieved by identifying and eliminating inflow sources in each
           area. The peaking factors experienced by various line segments can be used to further identify
           areas that may have serious hydraulic capacity problems.
           7.3.2.1.6. Total volume of inflow is not a good measure of the impact of inflow on sewers, lift
           stations, and treatment plants. Total inflow volumes, measured on a monthly or yearly basis,
           are typically relatively small in comparison to baseline sewage flows. It is the "hydraulic
           spike" caused by peak inflow rates that creates the greatest problem.
           7.3.2.1.7. Once an area of potential inflow concern is identified than smoke testing is appro-
           priate as the first line of definition to the problem. ACC has completed inflow studies for all
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          99


        bases. As part of this contract work, smoke testing, a relatively simple process, has been used
        to identify inflow sources.
     7.3.2.2. Infiltration.
        7.3.2.2.1. Infiltration is the term used to describe water entering a sewer system from indirect
        flow of storm water and groundwater into the sanitary sewer from leaking joints, misaligned
        service connections, tree roots and the like. Similarly to inflow, excessive infiltration can have
        detrimental effects on the ability of the WWTP to meet discharge requirements under an
        NPDES permit or a Final Governing Standard (for overseas locations).
        7.3.2.2.2. The presence of high groundwater inevitably results in an increase in the quantity of
        wastewater and the expense of disposing of it. The rate and quantity of infiltration depends on
        the terrain, the climate, and the length of the sewer service from the density of the population.
        Elimination of all infiltration is not practicable; however, environmental managers should
        work closely with maintenance personnel to correct sewer piping deficiencies so infiltration
        can be minimized.
     7.3.2.3. Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSOs):
        7.3.2.3.1. SSOs are releases of untreated sewage from manholes, sewer lines, pumping sta-
        tions, or treatment works. Excessive groundwater infiltration, storm water inflow, inadequate
        sewer line maintenance, pumping station failures, and sewer line breaks are the most common
        causes of SSOs at ACC bases.
        7.3.2.3.2. SSOs that reach the surface waters of the state or federal government are direct vio-
        lations of the CWA and are subject to enforcement action by EPA. Funding for rehabilitation
        falls in line with the latest USAF Guidance on using pollution prevention money to achieve
        compliance.
        7.3.2.3.3. ACC bases are often faced with the requirement to dispose of spent Aqueous Film
        Forming Foam (AFFF). One solution available to most ACC bases is to meter the spent AFFF
        into the sanitary sewer collection system. NOTE: 3M Corporation recommends product con-
        centrations be kept below 50 mg/l in aeration basins for 6% AFFF concentrates and 100 mg/l
        for 3% AFFF concentrates. Products used at 3% require greater dilution than products used at
        6% because the 3% concentrates have higher surfactant concentrations than the 6% concen-
        trates. A small pump may be used to control the input of AFFF into the system. In all cases
        the WWTP should be contacted and shall grant approval to discharge the AFFF prior to actual
        disposal.
  7.3.3. Section 503 Sludge Rule:
     7.3.3.1. The regulatory requirement for sludge management is found in 40 CFR 503, the Federal
     Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge. This standard "establishes requirements for
     debris collected in the preliminary treatment phase at a WWTP, pollutant limits, management
     practices, and operational standards for the final use or disposal of sewage sludge generated dur-
     ing the treatment of domestic sewage in a treatment works".
     7.3.3.2. Domestic sewage is defined as "waste and wastewater from humans or household opera-
     tions that is discharged to or otherwise enters a treatment works (EPA 1994)." Also, 40 CFR 258,
     Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (MSWLF), must be followed for any sludge that is
100                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         disposed of in a MSWLF. This regulation also pertains to any debris collected in the preliminary
         treatment phase at a WWTP.
         7.3.3.3. A number of Federal, Air Force, and state regulations and requirements must be consid-
         ered in an overall sludge management program. EPA's 40 CFR 503 establishes the primary
         requirements, which work in conjunction with other applicable regulations. Included in Part 503
         are regulations pertaining to sludge quality with respect to pollutant concentrations, presence of
         pathogens, and attractiveness to vectors; method of application, and general and managerial
         requirements associated with various sludge quality and use/disposal scenarios.
      7.3.4. Future Capacity, Management, Operation, and Maintenance (CMOM) Regulations:
         7.3.4.1. The CMOM regulations were proposed in January 2001 and withdrawn. EPA estimates
         the revised CMOM will be proposed by Fall 2002. The CMOM rule when promulgated will have
         an impact on ACC base operations and maintenance of wastewater systems. The following is pro-
         vided for base managers planning and programming purposes.
         7.3.4.2. Manage, operate, and maintain all parts of the wastewater collection system to insure
         adequate capacity and mitigate potential overflows.
         7.3.4.3. Identify, program, and provide the wastewater collection system with sufficient capacity
         to convey base flow rates and peak flow rates.
         7.3.4.4. Maintain an ongoing program to stop sanitary sewer overflows. Cleanup and mitigate the
         impact of sanitary sewer overflows. Develop an Overflow Emergency Response Plan to respond
         to sanitary sewer overflows.
         7.3.4.5. Notify the public if a sanitary sewer overflow occurs that could impact or expose the pub-
         lic to potential contaminates.
         7.3.4.6. Maintain an ongoing program to insure adequate capacity is provided through out the
         wastewater collection system.
         7.3.4.7. Incorporate Capacity, Management, Operation, and Maintenance (CMOM) regulatory
         requirements into the ECAMP audit protocols.

7.4. Storm Water Management Programs.
      7.4.1. The storm water program is implemented under 40 CFR 122.26. The primary focus of this reg-
      ulation is to control erosion and sediment.
      7.4.2. The Water Quality Act of 1987 (WQA). The WQA established the National Storm water Pro-
      gram that set up Phase I and II priority system for regulation of storm water.
         7.4.2.1. Phase I of the National Storm water Program regulates discharges permitted prior to Feb
         87, discharges associated with industrial activity, discharges from medium and large municipal
         separate storm water systems, and discharges that contribute to a violation of water quality stan-
         dard(s). Phase I also regulates discharges that are significant contributors of pollutants to waters
         of the U.S.
         7.4.2.2. Phase II regulates all storm water discharges not already regulated under Phase I. Phase
         II of the storm water regulations expands the existing national program to smaller municipalities
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                            101


     and construction sites that disturb 1 to 5 acres. Projects which will disturb 1 to 5 acres during con-
     struction must plan for storm water permits if required.
  7.4.3. Regulated Industrial Activities.
     7.4.3.1. Facilities which are defined as industrial activity are listed in categories in 40 CFR
     122.26(b)(i-xi). Industrial Activities include: subchapter N industries, heavy manufacturing,
     mining, hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal (TSD) facilities, landfills, stream electric
     power generating facilities, industrial transportation facilities, sewage treatment, construction
     activity, and light manufacturing.
         7.4.3.1.1. Sewage Treatment. Works with a design flow of greater than one million gallons
         per day used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of domestic sewage, includ-
         ing lands dedicated to disposal of the sewage sludge that are located within the confines of the
         facility.
     7.4.3.2. There are eleven categories listed in the regulation. Under Phase I of the Storm water
     Program, any activity at the base, which supports the mission (maintenance, re-fueling, material
     storage, hush houses, trim pads, fire training areas, ranges, etc.) falls under category viii as sup-
     porting the industrial activity for transportation by air.
         7.4.3.2.1. Other Air Force operations which are regulated are. DRMO (Category iv and vi),
         fuel tank farms (Category viii, separate from transportation by air), on-base sewage treatment
         works (includes lagoons) with greater than one million gallons per day (1 MGD) design flow
         (Category ix), inactive and active landfills which receive or have received industrial waste or
         construction debris and Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites (Category v).
         7.4.3.2.2. These areas listed may not be all inclusive. States that regulate the NPDES program
         may have a stricter interpretation of the regulations. Therefore, it is essential that the water
         program managers contact their regulator on the specific areas of the base which are regulated.
  7.4.4. Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).
     7.4.4.1. EPA uses the Storm water Pollution Prevention Plan as the tool for implementing the
     Storm water Program. The components of this plan include Planning and Organization (the
     SWPPP Team), Assessment Phase, Best Management Practices Identification Phase, Implementa-
     tion Phase, Evaluation, and Monitoring. Planning and Organization will be covered last because
     the responsibilities of the SWPPP team will be outlined in the implementation and evaluation and
     monitoring phases.
     7.4.4.2. In order to develop an effective SWPPP, a thorough assessment for all potential pollutant
     sources is required. This includes an inventory of all exposed significant materials (handled,
     stored, processed, treated, or disposed of in a manner to allow exposure to storm water in the past
     three years prior to the effective date of the permit). A list of the past significant spills, leaks (EPA
     requires a listing of these spills for the past three years from the effective date of the permit), and
     testing for illicit connections or non-storm water discharges is required.
     7.4.4.3. Illicit connections refer to any source of non-storm water flow that discharges from the
     base. Examples include any industrial wastewater (wash water), boiler blowdown, deicing activ-
     ity when the deicing operation results in an off base discharge, or compressor condensate.
     Non-storm water discharges that are not authorized by the base storm water permit must have a
102                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         separate individual NPDES permit for that discharge. These types of unpermitted discharges have
         been illegal since the passage of the CWA in 1972.
         7.4.4.4. Alternatives for dealing with these types of discharges include routing of these discharges
         to the sanitary sewer (if the wastewater treatment plant will accept the discharge); eliminate the
         discharge by a closed loop system (where feasible); collecting/disposing of the wastewater (exam-
         ple is drip pans for condensate); or permit the discharge. Applying for an individual permit for a
         non-storm water discharge is the least desirable alternative due to the extensiveness of the permit
         application and potential compliance problems with the permit once it is in force.
         7.4.4.5. Non-storm water discharges that are authorized under EPA general permits include are
         listed in paragraph 7.2.4.7.6. NPDES states may restrict this list and not allow some of these dis-
         charges to be authorized. In either case, all non-storm water discharges must be listed in the
         SWPPP.
         7.4.4.6. The SWPPP requires that a drainage map show the pattern of storm water drainage, exist-
         ing structural features which control runoff, flow locations with a significant potential for soil ero-
         sion, surface water bodies, locations of significant material, locations of past spills and leaks, and
         areas where the following activities take place: fueling, vehicle and equipment maintenance/
         cleaning, loading /unloading of material storage, material processing and disposal.
         7.4.4.7. Any existing monitoring data on quality and/or quantity of storm water discharges from
         the base must be described in this section of the SWPPP, to include methods and sampling collec-
         tion points.
      7.4.5. Best Management Practices Identification Phase:
         7.4.5.1. Best management practices (BMP) include process, procedures, practices, and structural
         controls that prevent or reduce discharge of pollutants in storm water runoff. Examples of BMPs
         are pavement curbing and regrading, diversion structures, and connecting industrial discharges to
         the sanitary sewer.
         7.4.5.2. EPA requires that eight "baseline" BMPs be implemented for all permittees. If these
         eight BMPs are insufficient for controlling pollutant discharge in storm water, site specific BMPs
         must be implemented. The eight baseline BMPs include Good Housekeeping, Preventive Mainte-
         nance, Visual Inspections, Spill Prevention and Response, Sediment and Erosion Control,
         Employee Training, Recordkeeping and Reporting, and Management of Runoff.
            7.4.5.2.1. Good Housekeeping. Good housekeeping involves proper procedures for handling
            of materials and equipment and maintaining a clean and orderly facility.
            7.4.5.2.2. Preventive Maintenance. Preventive maintenance involves regular inspection and
            maintenance of storm water management devices (outfalls, catch basins, and oil/water separa-
            tors) to ensure periodic maintenance and repair to preclude breakdown or failure. If routine
            inspections are not already implemented, a reasonable frequency for inspections is monthly
            until a baseline for problem identification can be established. Oil/water separators may need
            more frequent inspection.
            7.4.5.2.3. Visual Inspections. Visual inspections are required for assessing storm water out-
            falls and for completing the annual comprehensive site evaluation. Visual inspections of storm
            water outfalls are required monthly for the following characteristics: any observations of
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        103


       color, odor, clarity, floating solids, settled solids, suspended solids, foam, oil sheen, or other
       indicators of storm water pollution.
          7.4.5.2.3.1. The installation environmental water program manager is responsible for
          these inspections, however the base bioenvironmental engineer conducts sampling, analy-
          sis, and monitoring responsibilities (See discussion below concerning the SWPPP team.
          AFI 48-119, Medical Service Environmental Quality Programs, is in rewrite and may
          change Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) responsibilities in this area. HQ ACC/CEVQ
          will update BEE responsibilities accordingly, once the AFI is published.). Reports of these
          inspections must include: inspection date and time, inspection personnel, visual quality of
          storm water discharge, and any probable sources of any appearance of storm water con-
          tamination. Reports of these inspections must be filed with the SWPPP and signed by the
          installation environmental water program manager. The members of the SWPPP team
          require annual comprehensive site evaluations.
          7.4.5.2.3.2. To lessen the burden of these inspections for one or two individuals, each
          member of the SWPPP team should designate a person(s) for each organization to com-
          plete these inspections. The SWPPP team must schedule a date each year for these annual
          inspections. The inspection documents should be forwarded to the installation environ-
          mental office for filing. If the correction requires some type of construction, repair, etc.,
          the installation environmental office shall initiate the work order to ensure the deficiency
          is identified for correction. Items eligible for EC or CTP2 funds (See Chapter 15) shall be
          entered into ACES-PM.
          7.4.5.2.3.3. The designated installation environmental water program manager must
          inspect any erosion and/or structural storm water management controls to ensure they are
          operating correctly. EPA requires that inspection forms be signed by the authorized corpo-
          rate official, who for ACC bases is the installation commander.
          7.4.5.2.3.4. To comply with the requirement for this inspection, the environmental man-
          ager must compile the inspection forms and obtain the wing commander's signature as one
          package. From the date of completion of the inspection, the installation has two weeks to
          update the SWPPP, and the SWPPP team has no longer than twelve weeks to implement
          measures and controls for correction of any deficiencies. Federal regulations require the
          base to keep these inspection records until three years after the permit expires.
       7.4.5.2.4. Spill Prevention and Response. The requirements under the storm water program
       for Spill Prevention and Response are the same as for the requirements under the Spill Preven-
       tion Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC). The emphasis here is to ensure that employ-
       ees are properly trained and proper equipment is available in the event of a spill.
       7.4.5.2.5. Sediment and Erosion Control. The plan must identify measures to limit erosion
       for areas with a high potential for soil erosion. Examples of controls include installing rip-rap
       and natural vegetation.
       7.4.5.2.6. Employee Training. EPA requires that the SWPPP must have a program for
       informing personnel on the requirements under the SWPPP. Frequency is defined as at least
       once per year. The training must include good housekeeping, material management, and spill
       response procedures. It is recommended that contractors involved with any type of industrial
       activity be required to train their personnel on compliance with the SWPPP provisions as
104                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


             applicable. Each base should supplement this training as appropriate. Installations may incor-
             porate this training into already existing training programs. Records of training frequency and
             attendance shall be filed with the SWPPP. Each organization shall forward their records of
             training to the installation environmental office for filing.
             7.4.5.2.7. Recordkeeping and Reporting. The OPR for recordkeeping of compliance
             inspections, storm water monitoring, training, and spills is the installation environmental
             office. Each shop will submit copies of their inspection and training records to the installation
             environmental office to keep with the SWPPP. Shop supervisors must sign the record to doc-
             ument the required inspection and training was completed. In order to show that the base is
             complying with the SWPPP, the EPA or state regulator will need to see proof that training and
             inspections were completed.
             7.4.5.2.8. Management of Runoff. This requirement addresses a narrative evaluation of tra-
             ditional storm water management practices other than those that control pollutant sources
             which divert, infiltrate, reuse, or otherwise manage storm water to reduce pollutant discharge
             in storm water runoff. The emphasis here is what is reasonable and appropriate. The emphasis
             of the storm water program is not on treatment at this time. Therefore, BMPs such as infiltra-
             tion ponds or wet ponds need to be considered based on geographic location as well as the
             anticipated contaminants in the storm water.
                7.4.5.2.8.1. Ponds are effective in reducing sediment load; however, they must not
                become a "dump" for spills, AFFF, or contaminated storm water that may impact the
                groundwater quality. The feasibility of alternatives need to be considered on a case by
                case basis. Site Specific Best Management Practices: Site specific or advanced BMPs are
                typically structural BMPs specific for the facility. EPA encourages the reduction, reuse,
                and recycle approach in lieu of end of pipe treatment. BMPs such as use of drip pans or
                absorbent materials for spills/leaks, retrofitting of existing facilities to prevent run-on into
                industrial areas (berm and cover re-fueling areas), and installing oil/water separators
                where it is not feasible to have drip pans/dry cleanup (fuel tank farms) are just a few exam-
                ples of site specific BMPs.
                7.4.5.2.8.2. It is important to understand that your NPDES authority has the option of
                imposing a BMP in lieu of establishing numeric effluent limits on your storm water out-
                falls. Also, if BMPs are listed in the installation SWPPP then they must be completed and
                operations or the base is subject to enforcement. Hence, it is important to select a BMP
                after careful engineering analysis, regulatory consideration, and other requirements, before
                the BMP is placed in the SWPPP. If a BMP cannot be implemented, the SWPPP must be
                updated to validate why the BMP was not executed and explain the alternative feasible
                solution.
      7.4.6. Implementation Phase. The implementation phase in the SWPPP requires that a schedule be
      developed for implementation of the BMPs listed in the BMP Identification Phase. The non-structural
      BMPs should be implemented as soon as possible.
         7.4.6.1. Under the multi-sector permit, bases have no longer than three years from the date of the
         final permit issuance to implement the structural BMPs. The frequency of training and inspection
         must be listed in the SWPPP. EPA requires that training and annual comprehensive site evalua-
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          105


     tions be conducted annually at a minimum. Visual inspections of storm water outfalls are required
     on a quarterly basis.
  7.4.7. Evaluation. The purpose of the comprehensive site evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of
  the SWPPP. The SWPPP team needs to consider the results of their annual and quarterly inspections
  and revise the SWPPP procedures/practices in order to reduce the potential of storm water contamina-
  tion. The OPR for updating the plan is the CEV water program manager. However, the other mem-
  bers of the SWPPP are responsible for providing input for their respective operations for updating the
  SWPPP.
  7.4.8. Storm Water Sampling and Monitoring:
     7.4.8.1. Storm water sampling is completed for the application process, in contrast to storm water
     monitoring which is required after the storm water permit is issued. Storm water sampling is
     required for individual and group permit applicants. EPA requires that at least one representative
     sample be taken for the permit application.
     7.4.8.2. Representative implies that the storm event has at least 0.1 inch of rainfall and that it has
     been more than 72 hours since the last rain event. The two types of samples required are the first
     flush grab sample and a flow weighted composite sample. First flush samples are taken within the
     first 30 minutes of the discharge. Field testing for pH and temperature must be done in the field.
     7.4.8.3. Lab analysis for the grab sample typically include oil and grease, 5-Day Biological Oxy-
     gen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total
     Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), Nitrate + Nitrite Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, and all other constituents
     believed present in the discharge. Flow weighted samples may not be required by some permit
     applications. Flow weighted samples are manually collected (aliquots) and must be taken with a
     minimum of 15 minutes between samples and a minimum of three aliquots per hour for the entire
     discharge of the first three hours of discharge. Aliquots are combined according to the flow
     weights/volumes from each aliquot.
     7.4.8.4. Lab analysis for flow weighted samples are typically: BOD, COD, TSS, TKN, Nitrate +
     Nitrite Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, and all others believed present. Reference your permit for
     your storm water monitoring requirements. Typically, general permits are requiring grab samples
     and in some instances composite (time or flow weighted) samples.
     7.4.8.5. The frequency of monitoring is also stated in the permit as well as the deadline for sub-
     mission of discharge monitoring reports to the EPA or state regulator. Notices of violation can
     result from failure to monitor or failure to submit discharge monitoring reports in a timely manner.
     Ensure that monitoring is put as a priority and completed according to the procedures specified in
     the permit.
  7.4.9. The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan Team:
     7.4.9.1. Members of the SWPPP Team will involve the following: the installation commander as
     the responsible official, personnel in environmental management, all personnel involved in the
     areas identified as regulated under the storm water permit (all aircraft and vehicle maintenance
     shops, refueling operations, deicing operations, material unloading/loading, etc.) the Logistics
     Group, Bioenvironmental Engineering, the Disaster Preparedness, the Horizontal shops under the
     Base Civil Engineer, the Judge Advocate, and Public Affairs.
106                              ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      7.4.9.2. The installation commander ensures that the base is managing the storm water program.
      The installation commander is also responsible for certifying that non-storm water discharges do
      not exist in the SWPPP and for signing the annual comprehensive site evaluations.
      7.4.9.3. The Environmental Management Flight takes the lead on compliance with the SWPPP
      and the Storm water Permit provisions. The Environmental Flight is responsible for development,
      implementation, and annual comprehensive site evaluations of the SWPPP.
         7.4.9.3.1. Ensures that monitoring is complete and monitoring reports are submitted to the
         regulating authority in a timely fashion. Develops the employee training program and pro-
         vides training to the other cross-functional team members of the SWPPP team. Conducts
         quarterly inspections of the storm water outfalls and ensures that the annual inspections are
         conducted by appropriate shop personnel.
         7.4.9.3.2. Ensures that quarterly and annual records are complete and filed with the SWPPP.
         Initiates work orders as required as a result of inspections and/or to comply with the Storm
         water Permit. Ensures that follow up actions are executed by the appropriate SWPPP Team
         member.
      7.4.9.4. The Logistics Group Commander is responsible for designating personnel responsible for
      inspections and training for all shops classified as industrial activity.
         7.4.9.4.1. These key personnel will be responsible for training personnel within their shops on
         storm water compliance and the requirements of the SWPPP. Records of training (required at
         least once per year under the Federal Regulations) must be forwarded to base environmental
         office for filing with the SWPPP.
         7.4.9.4.2. These personnel will also be required to conduct the annual comprehensive site
         evaluation. Submit a copy of the inspection report to the base environmental office. They are
         required to make the appropriate changes in management practices as a result of their inspec-
         tions or upon discovery of a problem that may impact pollutants coming in contact with storm
         water.
      7.4.9.5. The BEE is the OPR for storm water sampling and monitoring. The BEE must ensure
      that monitoring is conducted as required by the storm water permit and monitoring results for-
      warded to CEV to report to the regulating authority. Some NPDES states require development
      and submission of a storm water monitoring plan. The BEE is responsible for developing and
      implementing the storm water monitoring plan. (NOTE: AFI 48-119 is in rewrite and may
      change BEE responsibilities in this area. HQ ACC/CEVQ will update BEE responsibilities
      accordingly, once the AFI is published.)
      7.4.9.6. Disaster Preparedness is responsible for emergency response and reviewing environmen-
      tal incidents to provide recommendations to changes in the SWPPP3.
      7.4.9.7. The Horizontal shops under the Base Civil Engineer are responsible for implementing
      structural best management practices or correction of illicit connections when completed as an
      in-house effort. Responsible for implementing management practices to minimize pollutants in
      deicing/cleaning pavements and preventing over application of pesticides/herbicides/fertilizers.
      7.4.9.8. The Judge Advocate advises the SWPPP team on the legal aspects associated with imple-
      menting the SWPPP and provides guidance in the implementation of BMPs.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                       107


     7.4.9.9. The Public Affairs office keeps informed of any permit violations, potential controversy
     with the EPA or state regulators regarding storm water compliance, and any other potentially
     non-compliant conditions under the storm water permit requirements. CEV must inform PA of
     any permit violations, potential controversy with the EPA or state regarding storm water compli-
     ance, and any other potentially non-compliant conditions under the storm water permit require-
     ments.
  7.4.10. Updating the SWPPP and Recordkeeping.
     7.4.10.1. Updates of the SWPPP are required for any action items that result from the annual
     comprehensive site evaluation, new operations, modifications to existing operations, termination
     of operations, and base realignment and closure.
     7.4.10.2. Annual Comprehensive Site Evaluation: Any action items resulting from this annual
     inspection must be annotated in the SWPPP within two weeks. The SWPPP team has twelve
     weeks to implement measures and controls to correct these items. If the base determines that a
     structural control is required to correct a deficiency, the deadline for implementation should be
     written into the plan. This deadline must be reasonable due to funding requirements and design
     milestones. Reference Chapter 15 for more details on funding. Records of the annual inspections
     must be retained for three years following permit expiration.
     7.4.10.3. New Operations: If the base is conducting new operations (a regulated industrial activ-
     ity) on site, the following steps must be taken:
        7.4.10.3.1. Determine if a construction storm water permit is needed. Although the federal
        regulations state that land disturbance less than five acres does not require a storm water con-
        struction permit, states may have ignored this five acre threshold. Also, Phase II of the Storm
        water Regulations potentially regulates all land disturbance construction projects, depending
        upon the watershed and the NPDES permitting authority. The bottom line is to check with
        your regulating agency.
        7.4.10.3.2. Incorporate BMPs into the design of the project. For example, ensure there are
        contained areas for material storage, covered areas for loading/unloading locations, proper
        spill containment, etc.
        7.4.10.3.3. Amend the SWPPP to include this industrial activity. Ensure that the monitoring
        requirements at the drainage outfall for this new operation coincide with the constituents now
        being monitored. Check with your regulator to ensure that your monitoring requirements will
        not change, or find out what the new monitoring requirements are.
        7.4.10.3.4. Notify your regulator prior to operation of the new industrial activity. Some states
        will require a specified number of days for this notification. This is prudent to do even if you
        believe that the new operation will not affect storm water quality.
     7.4.10.4. Modifications to Existing Operations. Treat this situation as you would a new opera-
     tion as stated above.
     7.4.10.5. Termination of Operations. Termination of an industrial activity is treated as a modi-
     fication. Submit written notification of termination and request permit modification to reflect the
     changes. The SWPPP will need to be amended. The storm water permit may have deadlines for
     the SWPPP to be amended.
108                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         7.4.10.6. Base Realignment and Closure. A base undergoing base realignment and closure
         (BRAC) is not necessarily exempt from the NPDES storm water permitting requirements.
            7.4.10.6.1. EPA or the state's rationale for continuing the permit stems from the fact that ter-
            mination of industrial activity does not result in the termination of storm water exposure of
            industrial materials/sites still in place. The base needs to work in close contact with the regu-
            lators to determine how to meet storm water permitting requirements taking BRAC into con-
            sideration.
            7.4.10.6.2. A Notice of Termination (NOT) will need to be submitted to the regulating author-
            ity when industrial operations cease. Some permits may have specific forms for the NOT. In
            other cases, a letter requesting termination of the permit and signed certification that industrial
            activity has terminated is sufficient. As the termination of industrial activity draws near, the
            SWPPP must modify the SWPPP to reflect the changes. Implementation of BMPs from a pre-
            ventive maintenance/materials management perspective must still be implemented. However,
            it does not make sense to continue the structural BMPs when the cessation of the industrial
            activity is drawing near.
         7.4.10.7. Recordkeeping. The installation environmental office is the OPR for filing and main-
         taining the SWPPP. Recordkeeping includes records of inspections, training, and updates of the
         SWPPP. Records must be kept for three years after the permit expires.
         7.4.10.8. Funding. Defense Environmental Restoration Account (DERA) Eligibility: DERA
         Funds do not apply for the structural corrections under the storm water program.
            7.4.10.8.1. O&M Environmental Compliance Program (ECP) Funding. This can be
            requested for correction of illicit connections and the structural BMPs.
            7.4.10.8.2. Correction of Illicit Connections. These are Level I ECP eligible projects. If
            illicit connections are not permitted as a separate non-storm water discharge, these corrections
            must be done immediately or the discharge eliminated or permitted.
            7.4.10.8.3. Structural BMPs are eligible for EC funds only after documenting ineffectiveness
            of non-structural BMPs or P2 actions. The multi-sector permit allows three years from the
            issuance of the final permit for implementation of structural BMPs. For bases under an indi-
            vidual, state general, or EPA baseline general permit, deadlines for structural BMPs need to be
            negotiated with the regulator.
            7.4.10.8.4. Operations and Services (O&S) ECP funding should be requested for any services
            related to non-construction related requirements for compliance with the storm water permit or
            SWPPP.
      7.4.11. Car Washes:
         7.4.11.1. Commercial car washes and organizational car washes are held to the same SW dis-
         charge standard as the rest of the base. Effluent from a organizational car wash which has the
         same potential to enter the waters of the U.S. needs to be captured and treated or discharged via a
         NPDES approved discharge point.
         7.4.11.2. The one exception to this rule is when only plain water is used at the car wash. In the
         case of plain water, no restrictions are required. Environmental compliance funds may be used to
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          109


     construct a centralized organizational car wash facility if the base's SWPPP identifies this as a
     structural BMP and is willing to restrict the use of other sites.
     7.4.11.3. The centralized organizational car wash will consist of capture and discharge to a sani-
     tary sewer and at least one hose bib. Base housing, including dormitories, fall into the gray area.
     It can be argued that these facilities are exempt from restrictions found in the SWPPP, especially
     when municipalities place no restrictions on residential car washes immediately outside the gate
     of the base. On the other hand, one could argue that these facilities are considered part of the base,
     fall under the control of the wing commander and need to be treated like other AF facilities on
     base. Since it is unclear as to which mutually exclusive solution is a correct interpretation each
     base must develop a policy which best fits their situation.
  7.4.12. Oil/Water Separators at Engine Test Cells. Engine test cells generate a significant quantity
  of waste POL, products that often find their way into the existing sanitary sewer collection system. It
  is HQ ACC policy to make ECP money available to bring these pretreatment facilities into full com-
  pliance with the CWA. Closed loop wash water reuse systems are encouraged as well as other more
  efficient technologies to capture POL products.
  7.4.13. Federal Consistency Guidelines for Non-Point Discharges:
     7.4.13.1. EPA proposed guidance on 26 Aug 98 that encourages states to review federal activities
     for their consistency with state non-point source discharge programs, particularly those activities
     that impact impaired or threatened waters.
     7.4.13.2. EPA issued this document "to support closer coordination among State and Federal
     agencies to improve implementation of non-point source management programs and more effec-
     tively protect water quality." ACC can expect closer scrutiny of its non-point source discharges
     because of this guidance.
  7.4.14. Phase II Storm Water Rule. On 8 Dec 99, EPA issued the second phase of the storm water
  regulations, Storm Water Phase II (64 FR 68722), which extend the requirements for NPDES permits
  to storm water discharge from: 1) "small" MS4s serving populations of less than a 100,000 in an
  "urbanized" area, and 2) construction activities disturbing between 1 and 5 acres of land. These small
  MS4s and construction activities are automatically designated as being regulated by this rule. In addi-
  tion, the Phase II rule expands the "no exposure" exclusion to all industrial activities covered under
  Phase I except for construction activity and sets a new deadline for permit coverage for munici-
  pally-owned industrial activity that had been temporarily exempted from storm water permit cover-
  age. The new rule will implement two significant changes in ACC NPDES storm water permitting.
     7.4.14.1. Construction activities that disturb between 1 and 5 acres require a permit under Phase
     II. This change could impact the amount of planning time needed before construction begins on
     new projects. ACC construction specifications should include requirements for the contractor to
     seek this permit as part of his project performance. The contractor's permit application will need
     to be processed through the base environmental flight.
     7.4.14.2. Residential areas will become part of the permit and the entire installation will now be
     considered a small municipal separate storm water system (MS4). Small MS4s in urbanized areas
     are required to submit a Phase II storm water permit application by 10 Mar 03, unless their
     NPDES permitting authorities decide to phase in permit coverage and establish alternative dead-
     lines. By 8 May 07, NPDES permitting authorities may also phase in coverage for small MS4s
110                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         with populations of less than 10,000. Six minimum measures are likely to be required for small
         MS4s in the Phase II storm water general permits. These include:
             7.4.14.2.1. Public education and outreach on storm water impacts.
             7.4.14.2.2. Public involvement/participation.
             7.4.14.2.3. Illicit discharge detection and elimination.
             7.4.14.2.4. Construction site storm water discharge control
             7.4.14.2.5. Post construction storm water management.
             7.4.14.2.6. Pollution prevention and good housekeeping.
         7.4.14.3. Under the Phase II permit, facilities could be required to submit BMPs to address these
         areas and provide measurable reduction goals. The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, which
         NPDES storm water permits written for ACC bases become an enforceable part of the permit.
         Therefore, it is critical, that simple, achievable, cost-effective BMPs are selected. Within ACC
         examples of such BMPs are a public education program on limiting use of and runoff from garden
         chemicals, a soil and erosion control policy in military family housing areas, and good housekeep-
         ing practices. Regulatory agencies have informally indicated they will place great emphasis upon
         education and awareness programs.
         7.4.14.4. For more information on the storm water Phase II proposed, base managers may wish to
         view EPA's http://www.epa.gov/owm/sw2.htm web site or read DOD Implementation Guidance
         for Storm Water Phase II Regulations, 15 Sep 00.

7.5. Oil Pollution Act (OPA).
      7.5.1. The 1990 Oil Pollution Act, 33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq., which also amended section 311 of the
      CWA (42 U.S.C. 1321), regulates the discharge of oil and oil products into or upon the navigable
      waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines by non-transportation related facilities. All ACC
      installations are considered non-transportation related facilities. However, the equipment used to
      transfer fuel or oil to or from a vessel over water is considered transportation related in accordance
      with 40 CFR 112, Appendix A, and is subject to the authority and control of the Department of Trans-
      portation.
         7.5.1.1. The Coast Guard is the regulating agency for transportation related facilities. Even if the
         vast majority of the installation is subject to 40 CFR Part 112, the Coast Guard is the regulating
         agency for any equipment transferring POL over water. This should be of particular concern to
         any ACC installation that receives POL over a waterway.
         7.5.1.2. The definition of navigable waters in 40 CFR 110.1 is extremely broad and can include
         waterways down to the smallest stream. As a result, most ACC installations are subject to the
         requirements of the OPA. The applicable requirements of the OPA are found in 40 CFR Part 112,
         and are broken into two basic parts; the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC)
         Plan in 40 CFR 112.3, and the Facility Response Plan in 40 CFR 112.20.
      7.5.2. Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Requirements:
         7.5.2.1. The SPCC regulations are part of the original OPA of 1990, and detail specific require-
         ments and recommended guidelines for oil pollution prevention. In July 2002, significant revi-
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           111


     sions to the regulations for UST SPCC plans took place (Fed Register 67 FR 47042, 17 July 2002)
     which may place additional requirements on ACC installations. Existing facility SPCC plans
     must meet the new requirements by 17 February 2003. New facility installations must revise their
     SPCC plans to meet new requirements by 18 August 2003.
         7.5.2.1.1. The EPA Regional SPCC Coordinator has the ability to set specific criteria for plans
         in that region. The written plan should discuss the steps taken to prevent the discharge of oil
         and oil products to navigable waters. The plan should include, but is not limited to, discus-
         sions of secondary containment systems, overfill prevention, spill prevention during product
         transfer operations, and inspection and testing of product storage and transfer equipment.
         Once the plan is complete, discussion with the Regional SPCC coordinator would be prudent
         to ensure all regional specific information is included.
     7.5.2.2. The SPCC must be updated every five years and must be signed by a professional engi-
     neer (PE) to be acceptable. Technical amendments must be certified by a licensed PE. These
     plans are not required to be submitted to EPA, but must be up-to-date and available during any
     inspection. At ACC installations, the SPCC is often part of a broader Spill Prevention and
     Response (SPR) plan. The SPR is commonly used to encompass the SPCC as well as the Oil and
     Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency (OHSPC) plan under CERCLA (40 CFR 300), and
     the contingency plan requirements under RCRA (40 CFR 265.51).
     7.5.2.3. EPA Regional SPCC coordinators play a large role in SPCC implementation and are
     tasked with providing technical assistance to the regulated community. They, rather than EPA
     headquarters, are the source of policy and guidance relating to SPCC issues. Installations should
     partner with their regional coordinators to determine whether SPCC requirements apply and, if
     they do apply, to validate the base's strategy for SPCC planning. The strategy for SPCC planning
     segments the base into several facilities to which SPCC applies. This website, http://
     www.epa.gov/oerrpage/oilspill/docs/, contains a definition of "facility" that supports this
     approach and gives some criteria for viewing a given operation at a facility. Thus, the SPCC
     would not apply to all of an installation, but only to certain portions, such as bulk fuels. After base
     personnel make this determination and develop SPCC plans that make regulated "facilities" clear,
     invite the regional SPCC Coordinator to provide technical assistance to validate the approach or
     offer guidance on how to correct deficiencies in the approach.
     7.5.2.4. Ensure all environmental projects meet all base and ACC design standards. All repairs
     must be completed in accordance with MIL-HDBK-1022, and Air Force standard designs. HQ
     ACC/CEO requires full sleeve carrier pipe, meaning the sleeve starts on one side of the dike and
     continues through the other side to prevent the piping from rubbing the concrete and to provide
     containment should the carrier pipe rupture. This ensures that if the pipe fails between the dike
     walls, the fuel does not contaminate the environment and the spill is contained. Half penetration
     sleeves are not to be used; they increase the risk of pipe failure due to corrosion and the inability
     to determine where the leak is coming from. Defense Energy Supply Center is responsible for
     funding, however if installations do not follow construction standards, the installation may be
     responsible for spill response and clean-up expenses incurred from a rupture in these pipes.
  7.5.3. Facility Response Plans:
     7.5.3.1. The EPA final rule published in 59 FR 34070, 1 Jul 94, amends the 40 CFR Part 112, "Oil
     Pollution Prevention" regulations and implements the new requirements of the OPA. The new
112                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         regulations apply to non-transportation related onshore facilities that, because of their location,
         could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into
         or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. Air Force bases are considered non-transpor-
         tation-related onshore facilities.
         7.5.3.2. Facilities that meet this criteria are considered "Substantial Harm" (SH) facilities. Facil-
         ities meeting SH criteria are required to submit a facility response plan that includes information
         on response actions to be taken in the event of a spill, response resources and equipment, points of
         contact, evacuation plans, and hazard evaluations. In addition, the plan must discuss response
         planning for a worst-case scenario oil spill as well as smaller spills. Once the plan has been sub-
         mitted to the EPA, the Regional Administrator may determine that the facility is a "Significant and
         Substantial Harm" (SSH) facility after considering several factors including past spill history,
         geography, age of storage equipment, and other information.
         7.5.3.3. If the Regional Administrator determines a facility to be an SSH, he can then approve the
         plan, or require amendments to the plan to ensure it meets the requirements of 40 CFR Part
         112.20. Many bases may wish to incorporate the FRP into their existing SPR plan. Although the
         plans will undoubtedly share much information, and there is no specific regulation against it, it is
         up to the regional administrator to determine if a combined plan is adequate.
         7.5.3.4. The EPA has proposed two ways in which a facility may be identified as posing substan-
         tial harm: through a self-selection process; or by determination of the Regional Administrator
         (RA).
            7.5.3.4.1. For the self-selection process, 40 CFR 112.20(f)(1) of the regulation lists specific
            criteria to evaluate if a facility poses substantial harm. If a base is determined not to be a SH
            facility, the base must complete and maintain the certification form found in 40 CFR Part 112,
            appendix C. A facility falls under the "substantial harm" category if it meets at least one of the
            following elements:
                7.5.3.4.1.1. The facility has a total storage capacity greater than or equal to 42,000 gallons
                and performs over water oil transfers to or from vessels.
                7.5.3.4.1.2. The facility has a total storage capacity greater than or equal to one million
                gallons; and meets any one of the following conditions. It does not have adequate second-
                ary containment for each above ground storage area; it is located such that a discharge
                could cause "injury" to an environmentally sensitive area; it is located such that a dis-
                charge would shut down a public drinking-water intake; or it has had, in the past 5 years a
                reportable spill greater than or equal to 10,000 gallons.
            7.5.3.4.2. The Regional Administrator has the authority to determine that a facility may cause
            substantial harm, regardless of the results of the self-selection screening process.
         7.5.3.5. Facility Response Training (FRP) and Drills/Exercises. In addition to the FRP, the
         OPA requires that a facility owner shall implement a facility training and exercise program for
         personnel responsible for spill response activities.
      7.5.4. Catastrophic Spill Response:
         7.5.4.1. Most ACC installations do not have the in-house capability or the contract avenues to
         handle a large-scale petroleum spill. This presents a problem since the OPA requires that SH and
         SSH facilities have resources available to handle any potential spill. The US Navy currently has
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           113


      one of the largest in-house spill response capabilities in the world; their services are available to
      any DoD facility at any time. ACC has a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Navy
      Supervisor of Salvage dated 30 Mar 97 for oil spill response service. Installations may request
      support of these services through HQ ACC/CEVQ.
      7.5.4.2. The U.S. Navy also has a nation-wide contract support for spill response. These
      resources can be activated with a telephone call, and response teams can be anywhere in the world
      within hours or days. Funds to pay for the Navy's services can be transferred after the initial
      response has begun. It is important to note that these services are intended for large scale, cata-
      strophic type spills and not everyday occurrences. The Navy's equipment and services can be
      cited within installation Facility Response Plans as available spill response resources.
      7.5.4.3. The installation leadership determines the conditions that might warrant emergency sup-
      port of this nature. Small to moderate spills (i.e., less than 20,000 gallons) that can be contained
      on base property and recovered with local resources would not be considered catastrophic. On the
      other hand, an uncontrolled spill of similar (or greater) magnitude to a local waterway could war-
      rant emergency measures of this nature.
      7.5.4.4. Particular attention should be paid to the potential to adversely impact sensitive ecosys-
      tems, drinking water resources, or the public. Every situation is different, and all factors should be
      considered before making any decision. The Navy response team can be reached at the following
      24-hour emergency response telephone number commercial (703) 695-0231 and DSN 225-0231.
      For additional information during duty hours, call commercial (703) 607-2758 and DSN
      327-2758.

7.6. Special Purpose Waste Water Systems.
   7.6.1. Oil Water Separators:
      7.6.1.1. The Air Force policy on the maintenance and construction of oil/water separators and
      their operations was forwarded to ACC bases via HQ ACC/CEVQ policy letter dated 1 Aug 95.
      The contents of this letter are incorporated herein as the basis of the Command's oil/water separa-
      tor maintenance and construction policy.
         7.6.1.1.1. Gravity feed oil/water separators are designed to remove only free-floating pollut-
         ants, primarily petroleum products oils, lubricants, fuels, etc. To stay in compliance with the
         NPDES permit requirements, installations must control the pollutant discharges from indus-
         trial operations and implement effective operations and maintenance programs for oil/water
         separators. In accordance with HQ USAF/CE letter dated 21 Oct 1994, Subject: Oil/Water
         Separators Operations, Maintenance, and Construction. The Air Force policy outlined below
         will help the Command achieve the goal of zero notices of violation.
         7.6.1.1.2. Training. Utilize the Joint-Services Oil/Water Separator Guidance and Training
         Support Package developed by the DoD CWA Services Steering Committee and distributed by
         HQ USAF/ILEV 5 Jul 01. This guidance package includes an interactive CD and a compre-
         hensive OWS resource with detailed information on all aspects of OWS use. Two videos are
         included which provides tailored training to shop level personnel who use an OWS and a
         maintenance level video for technical operation/maintenance personnel. ACC environmental
         flight personnel should provide at minimum the training in the videos to pertinent shop and
         maintenance personnel. The full training 1.75- and 1.9-hour course for shop and maintenance
114                               ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         personnel, respectively, may be also used as the base environmental flight determines best
         serves their installation.
      7.6.1.2. Existing Oil/Water Separators.
         7.6.1.2.1. For existing oil/water separators each base shall develop and implement a plan to
         assess the need for, and effectiveness of, existing oil/water separators with the goal of consol-
         idation or elimination of ineffective units. Each ACC base shall perform a comprehensive
         inventory of all existing oil/water separators (including on-line oil and grease/fuel traps, and
         small oil/water separators outside of hangars, corrosion control facilities, fuel transfer/storage
         operations, AGE equipment maintenance shops, wash racks, etc.).
         7.6.1.2.2. Identify all sources of pollutants being discharged from individual shops connected
         to each of the separators, and the mode of discharge (such as to storm sewer, sanitary sewer,
         septic tank or direct discharge to the waters of the US.). Identify monitoring and discharge
         limits. Locate the oil/water separator on the base utility as-built drawings and update the
         information as changes occur.
      7.6.1.3. Operations and Maintenance.
         7.6.1.3.1. Eliminate unpermitted pollutants and prohibit discharge of wastewater from indus-
         trial operations containing hazardous wastes and heavy metals.
         7.6.1.3.2. Implement dry cleanup procedures and only use floor drains to carry residual
         amounts of floating petroleum pollutants. Plug floor drains to oil/water separators that carry
         industrial wastewater from shops. Treat and dispose of industrial waste separately.
         7.6.1.3.3. Establish a primary office of responsibility (functional organization for the manage-
         ment of pollutants discharged and CE for maintenance of oil/water separators) which under-
         stands and has direct control over respective functions.
         7.6.1.3.4. Remove and test oil/water separator sludge regularly prior to disposal to ensure
         compliance with the sludge disposal requirements. Conduct inspections of oil/water separa-
         tors often enough to ensure the system is working as designed. Label drums that store this
         waste as "uncharacterized waste" until test results are available. If sludge is hazardous, take
         immediate actions to identify and eliminate sources of hazardous pollutants. Dispose of
         sludge as a hazardous waste and retest wastewater from oil/water separator to assure compli-
         ance.
      7.6.1.4. Construction of Oil/Water Separators:
         7.6.1.4.1. Before construction of Oil/Water Separators (OWSs) do not build any new separa-
         tors either through Real Property Maintenance by Contract (RPMC) or MILCON projects
         until your bases have completed evaluation of the effectiveness of all existing oil/water sepa-
         rators and established a consolidation program. Install a double liner with leak detection sys-
         tem for new separators including associated oil recovery tanks.
         7.6.1.4.2. Do not build gravity separators for wastewater containing emulsified petroleum
         residuals, AFFF releases, and other non-floating pollutants from industrial operations. Do not
         mix waste streams that are discharged to sewer systems; CWA and RCRA regulations prohibit
         discharges without the required level of treatment. Plan to install a sand trap or grit chamber
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        115


          for any OWS that has the potential to receive dirt, sand, clay or debris. A grit chamber is
          required for vehicle car washes.
          7.6.1.4.3. Table 7.3. and Table 7.4. provide guidelines for evaluating the construction or
          retention of OWSs in ACC. Installations will employ these guidelines wherever possible, and
          consult with HQ ACC CEVQ/CEOI when different approaches are desired. The guidelines
          are developed from the following principles:
               7.6.1.4.3.1. Eliminate OWS where the waste stream can be eliminated or changed to a dry
               process.
               7.6.1.4.3.2. Eliminate OWS if the waste stream will not interfere or disrupt operation the
               WWTP.
               7.6.1.4.3.3. Eliminate use of OWS for emergency purposes unless it can be shown that
               another method cannot be used.
               7.6.1.4.3.4. Eliminate OWS where waste stream does not contain free floating pollutants.

   7.6.2. Crash Fire Rescue Training Facilities (CFRTF):
      7.6.2.1. CFRTFs provide an essential live training environment for fire fighters to acquire the
      necessary skills to properly and effectively respond to aircraft crashes in accordance with AFI
      32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program, and NFPA standards.
      The objective of this policy is to construct a "closed" system that does not release wastewater to
      the environment. Construction of CFRTFs is appropriate to meet this need using only hydrocar-
118                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         bon liquid and gas as fire fuels. Construction will follow the guidance contained in HQ USAF/CE
         1 Sep 1995 memorandum and is summarized in the following policy.
            7.6.2.1.1. This policy does not apply to structural fire training facilities. Structural fire train-
            ing facilities use specialized construction methods and create structural training fires using
            Class A materials, such as straw and wood, to create heat and smoke for structural fire
            response training. Environmental flights shall direct discharges from structural fire training
            facility sites through a manual shut-off valve to the sanitary sewer system.
            7.6.2.1.2. Air Force policy is to construct a double liner with leak detection to ensure
            long-term containment control and protection from release to the environment. While single
            liner designs may meet all regulatory requirements, it is HQ ACC policy to construct new only
            double lined system. Exceptions to this policy require a waiver approved by HQ ACC/CE.
            7.6.2.1.3. Facilities with existing single lined system shall install shallow ground water mon-
            itoring wells or other proven methodology to serve as a leak detection system. The installation
            of the wells can be accomplished using environmental compliance or operations and mainte-
            nance funds. The leak detection system must be tested at least annually to verify it is function-
            ing properly. Maintain records of leak detection system checks indefinitely.
            7.6.2.1.4. All FY96 CFRTFs and beyond will include double liners with leak detection sys-
            tems in accordance with guidance from HQ USAF/CE Letter dated 1 Sep 1998, "Double Liner
            and Leak Detection System Requirements for New Aircraft Crash Fire Rescue Training Facil-
            ities (CFRTFs)."
         7.6.2.2. A system of regular monitoring, recordkeeping, and crosschecks must be instituted to
         ensure compliance at all times. Maintain records of leak detection system checks indefinitely.
         7.6.2.3. See paragraph 6.7.2. for a discussion of air emission issues.
      7.6.3. AFFF Retention Ponds:
         7.6.3.1. For new aircraft facilities comply with HQ AFCESA Engineering Technical Letter (ETL)
         01-2, Fire Protection Engineering Criteria - New Aircraft Facilities, paragraph A.1.2.5. Retention
         systems are not required for facilities/systems designed and constructed in accordance with this
         ETL. Foam-water retention is not required in the following cases:
            7.6.3.1.1. In geographic regions where there is little or no open water, streams, or wetlands,
            and no high-ground water table. (Solar evaporation is an appropriate disposal method in these
            areas).
            7.6.3.1.2. For testing discharges of any systems. Test headers are required on all new
            foam-water systems allowing controlled discharge into a tank or other portable collection
            device, such that retention capability is not required.
            7.6.3.1.3. For wet-pipe and pre-action systems, since the closed heads prevent accidental dis-
            charge.
            7.6.3.1.4. For high-expansion foam systems, because the highly expanded foam contains little
            liquid and is impractical to control.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           119


         7.6.3.1.5. For low level foam water nozzle systems, properly installed and maintained, these
         systems do not have discharges. Unplanned accidental discharges are not "most probable
         worst case" event.
         7.6.3.1.6. For catastrophic events, such as actual fires. Foam discharge associated with a fire
         is not a "most probable worst case" event. A fire in a hangar is a catastrophic event. Design-
         ing a containment system for a catastrophic event is impractical due to the number of associ-
         ated variables and the mass of fire debris generated.
     7.6.3.2. Retention ponds may be needed to hold AFFF and water mixtures after a release, and
     may be constructed only after validation by HQ ACC/CEVQ program managers. To be EC eligi-
     ble, the installation must provide specific environmental regulatory citation the retention pond is
     necessary. See Chapter 15 for specific funding eligibility criteria. Request for ECP funding will
     be considered for AFFF ponds if the need is driven by environmental regulatory requirements.
     Other ponds must be funded from the O&M or MILCON project constructing/renovating the pri-
     mary facility. It is not ACC policy to fund single use AFFF release containment tanks or lagoons.
     7.6.3.3. Where retention ponds are environmental regulation required, they will be constructed to
     support several hangers, docks, or other facilities.
     7.6.3.4. It is ACC policy to support multi-use spill containment tanks or lagoons with ECP funds
     where direct regulatory compliance can be linked to their construction. These tanks or lagoons
     should be sized to hold the largest release anticipated while maintaining a freeboard of at least an
     additional 10 % by volume. Tanks and lagoons should be double lined and be designed to provide
     for aeration (for AFFF releases) and a means to remove the spilled liquids such as by the use of
     dry hydrants. Base environmental managers must understand the rate at which AFFF can be dis-
     charged to the sanitary sewers.
  7.6.4. Deicing:
     7.6.4.1. Base environmental compliance officials need to play an active role in making sure that
     their base maintains full compliance with their storm water discharge permit and the Storm Water
     Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The 311 HSW/XPE, Brooks AFB via a contract with MELE
     Associates, Inc. prepared an all MAJCOM coordinated comprehensive Air Force Aircraft Deicing
     Development Plan, dated 31 May 2001. The following provides a synopsis of key elements of this
     plan.
     7.6.4.2. The control of runoff from aircraft deicing operations is a significant compliance and pol-
     lution prevention issue for ACC installations as well as commercial airports. The adverse impacts
     of spent fluids on receiving bodies are a result of two factors, the biochemical oxygen demand
     (BOD) and the aquatic toxicity of the fluids.
     7.6.4.3. The shift from Ethylene Glycol (EG) to Propylene Glycol (PG) based fluids has reduced
     the toxicity issue, however toxicity of the fluids is now associated with the additives, primarily tri-
     azoles (corrosion inhibitors) which still causes BOD concerns. Existing PG based fluid concen-
     trates exert a five-day BOD of approximately 730,000 mg/L compared to raw sewage typical
     values of 110 to 400 mg/L.
     7.6.4.4. Five research projects are underway to develop and/or evaluate alternatives to glycol
     based fluids. Four of the projects have been funded or sponsored by Air Force organizations. The
     alternative fluids developed will not be commercially available for several years. Furthermore,
120                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         three of these fluids will have BOD levels within two orders of magnitude of the existing fluids.
         Thus, even these improved fluids may require the same types of containment and collection meth-
         ods currently used.
         7.6.4.5. Other alternatives being pursued include an ASC/ENVV project to develop and evaluate
         mobile infrared deicing units. Alternative solutions being researched include sorbitol-based deic-
         ing fluids, anti-icing/deicing agent using naturally occurring antifreeze proteins, and development
         of custom ADF mixes. These efforts may prove to be cost effective, as well as eliminate 90 per-
         cent of fluid use.
         7.6.4.6. The control of spent aircraft deicing fluid remains an ACC concern. Discharges from air-
         craft deicing operations are regulated under the CWA and its NPDES. The CWA requires a facil-
         ity to obtain a discharge permit from local authorities. The allowable quality and quantity of
         discharges, as well as the required monitoring requirements, varies from state to state.
         7.6.4.7. Aircraft deicing is governed by Technical Order T.O. 42C-1-2, "Anti-icing, De-icing and
         Defrosting of Parked Aircraft". The most recent version is Change 3, 1 May 2000. The T.O. pro-
         vides direction on the types of fluids authorized for use. Also, the Single Manager must approve
         the application of any new fluid on a specific platform. MIL Type II fluids which contain ethylene
         glycol are no longer authorized for purchase. Three fluid specifications are authorized for use to
         deice/anti-ice an aircraft:
             7.6.4.7.1. MIL-A-8243, Type I and Type II; Deicing fluids.
             7.6.4.7.2. AMS 1424 Type I; De-icing fluid.
             7.6.4.7.3. AMS 1428 Type II and Type IV; Anti-Icing fluids.
         7.6.4.8. Existing stocks of ethylene glycol-based deicing chemicals may only be used for aircraft
         deicing; they may not be used for runway deicing (Pentagon Operations Directorate, April 1994).
      7.6.5. Silver Recovery Units:
         7.6.5.1. Silver recovery units shall be maintained in good repair at all times. Environmental com-
         pliance funds can be used to upgrade existing silver recovery units providing the existing units no
         longer meet minimum pretreatment standards.
         7.6.5.2. While most types of silver recovery units available for purchase can be used, HQ ACC/
         CEVQM recommends that for simplicity a double cartridge be used for small flows. These car-
         tridges run in series and are replaced (and sent to a recycler) once a year.
      7.6.6. Aircraft Daily Rinse Directive. In accordance with T.O. 1-1-691, daily rinse is required after
      low-level flight (under 3000 ft) over salt water. Severe corrosion environments, for example, Langley
      and Eglin AFBs, are particularly vulnerable to corrosion from salt deposits and chlorides. It is critical
      that aircraft in these locations closely adhere to established wash/rinse cycles. ACC installation envi-
      ronmental managers may request environmental funding for the wash/rinse system effluent collection
      system. The supply and sprinkler system is not environmental compliance funds eligible.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         121


                                               Chapter 8

                              SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (SDWA)

8.1. General Requirements. ACC complies with all applicable federal, state, and local drinking water
regulations. The primary tools used by regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with the SDWA are the
federal and state primary and secondary drinking water regulations.
   8.1.1. Responsibilities:
       8.1.1.1. The HQ ACC/CEVQM Environmental Quality Branch, Media Section, is responsible for
       validation of ECP funding for environmental drinking water requirements; preparation of Com-
       mand environmental drinking water policy, such as contained in this manual; and to advocate for
       environmental drinking water programs and solutions to achieve full compliance with the SDWA.
       8.1.1.2. Each base installation environmental drinking water program manager is responsible for
       identifying existing environmental drinking water deficiencies, new requirements, and to ensure
       full compliance with state and Federal SDWA derived regulations. Base program managers are
       responsible for identifying deficiencies in drinking water environmental compliance and program-
       ming actions to correct these deficiencies.
   8.1.2. Policy Guidance:
       8.1.2.1. Applicable Air Force guidance for drinking water is found in AFI 32-1067, Water Sys-
       tems, and AFI 32-1066, Plumbing Systems. The instruction outlines Federal and Air Force
       requirements for operating and maintaining water systems. The overall objective of the AFI is to
       ensure effective operation and maintenance of domestic drinking water systems, while protecting
       the environment. The procedures in the instruction are essential to achieve and maintain compli-
       ance with federal, state, and local standards for drinking water quality.
       8.1.2.2. The Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq., most recently amended in 1996, is
       the primary statute. Under the SDWA, EPA establishes primary and secondary drinking water
       regulations. The primary drinking water regulations identify maximum contaminant levels and
       requirements for monitoring, reporting, recording, record keeping, filtration and disinfection. The
       primary drinking water standards also control lead and copper contamination. ACC activities in
       foreign countries will manage drinking water quality to achieve and maintain compliance with the
       DoD Final Governing Standards.
   8.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter shall be
   requested to HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and provide
   adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on sound
   engineering and/or environmental practices to maintain environmental compliance.
   8.1.4. Applicability:
       8.1.4.1. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations, ANG, and
       AFRES units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing commander.
       Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordination
       with the host installation.
       8.1.4.2. This guidance does not apply to ACC installations located in foreign countries. For envi-
       ronmental compliance at ACC OCONUS installations and operations, use the more stringent of
122                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), Treaty, DoD Instructions, or Final Governing
         Standards (FGS). If there are local or host nation regulations not covered by these documents,
         then the base shall request HQ ACC/CEV conduct a case-by-case determination.

8.2. Permits.
      8.2.1. Base Requirements. Most states require permits to construct and operate drinking water treat-
      ment systems. Federal, state and local regulatory agencies regulate specific primary drinking water
      standards, secondary drinking water standards, and maximum contaminate levels. Base drinking
      water system managers must be familiar with their respective regulatory agencies permitting require-
      ments.
         8.2.1.1. Permits are available for public inspection and as such "opens" ACC installation opera-
         tions to public scrutiny. Drinking water system managers must review all draft permit conditions
         and negotiate realistic conditions when appropriate. Installations managers will consult with
         ACC/CEV/JAV and AFCEE REO offices to prepare substantive input during the public comment
         period. Drinking water system program managers at each base must be diligent in fully comply-
         ing with all permit conditions.
         8.2.1.2. The drinking water system manager must develop comprehensive and complete manage-
         ment tools to ensure the base maintains compliance with all permit conditions. This may involve
         extensive record keeping many different organizations on the installation as well as periodic sam-
         pling and testing as required by the permit and regulations.
      8.2.2. Permit Fees:
         8.2.2.1. All base activities engaged in operating, modifying, demolishing, or constructing a drink-
         ing water system will obtain operating permits as required by federal, state, or local regulatory
         agencies. Permit fees are a valid operations and services expense of the ECP account. Program as
         a level 0 requirement in ACES-PM.
      8.2.3. Permit Planning:
         8.2.3.1. Ensure all project budgets requiring modification or construction of a drinking water sys-
         tem provide for pollution controls as required by air regulations. For example, air stripping to
         remove TCE will require a permit.

8.3. Selected Water Topics.
      8.3.1. Public Drinking Water Systems:
         8.3.1.1. Public Drinking Water Systems are defined as a "system for the provision to the public of
         piped water for human consumption, if such system has at least 15 service connections or regu-
         larly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 days out of the year." This
         includes any collection, treatment, storage, or distribution facility under the control of the operator
         of the public water system and used in connection with the system. In addition, it includes any
         water collection or pretreatment system storage facility not under the control of the operator that
         are used primarily in connection with the system.
         8.3.1.2. The primary drinking water standards apply to public drinking water systems unless it is
         exempt based on following items: the system consists only of distribution and storage facilities
         (and does not have any collection and treatment facilities); the system obtains all of its water from,
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         123


    but is not owned or operated by, a public water system which is regulated; the system does not sell
    water to any other person; and the system is not a carrier which conveys passengers in interstate
    commerce. If a base operates a public water system, then the base is subject to the SDWA unless
    it meets all of the criteria identified in the list above.
    8.3.1.3. A public water system must regularly analyze treated water to ensure Maximum Contam-
    inate Levels (MCLs) are not met (or exceeded) and monitor for other contaminants that may have
    an adverse affect on the health of personnel and are known to occur in the public water system. In
    addition, personnel must be notified whenever the water quality of the system does not meet
    MCLs. ACC environmental flights should request BEE assistance if notification requirements are
    triggered.
       8.3.1.3.1. In recent years the EPA has promulgated various standards which have lowered
       MCLs and may impact ACC public water supply system compliance. Bases should be famil-
       iar with the following new or revised standards to ensure full compliance:
           8.3.1.3.1.1. Arsenic standard for drinking water which lower the MCL to 10 ppb effective
           Jan 06.
           8.3.1.3.1.2. Radionucleides rule which requires all distribution sampling points to be
           tested and is effective Dec 03.
           8.3.1.3.1.3. Stage 1 Disinfectant, Disinfection-by-products rule which adds more by-prod-
           ucts monitoring and lower MCLs and must be complied with by Jan 04.
           8.3.1.3.1.4. Radon rule which requires monitoring for the first time with an MCL of 300
           pCi/L with an estimated effective data of Feb 06.
           8.3.1.3.1.5. Groundwater disinfection rule which requires groundwater to be disinfected.
           The EPA published the proposed rule in May 00.
    8.3.1.4. Record Keeping. An operator of a public water system must keep records of bacterio-
    logical analysis for 5 years and chemical analysis for 10 years. This data should include the date,
    time and place of the sample and the person taking the sample. The type of sample taken (distri-
    bution system, check sample, raw water sample, process water sample, and other special purpose
    sample). The analysis records should include the date of the analysis, laboratory and person per-
    forming the analysis, the analytical technique used, and the results of the analysis. The installation
    Environmental Flight should record any action taken by the system to correct violations of pri-
    mary drinking water regulations, and maintain the records for 3 years. Sanitary surveys of the sys-
    tem shall be maintained for 10 years. When the system is fielded this data must be maintained in
    the ACES-EM drinking water sub-module.
    8.3.1.5. About one half of ACC bases receive their drinking water from local community PWSs.
    The rest have their own wells. Typically water treatment at ACC facilities include chlorination,
    fluoridation, and some type of pH adjustment or corrosion control. Aluminum sulfate is added to
    water to remove large particles from raw untreated water. This causes the water to become acidic
    so lime is usually added to maintain a proper pH balance. Chlorine is added to kill bacteria and
    viruses. Zinc orthophosphate or other similar chemicals are added to control corrosion in the pip-
    ing systems to help sequester lead. Some community water supplies have switched to chloramines
    as the primary disinfectant. While not as persistent as chlorine there are less disinfect ion by-prod-
    uct concerns.
124                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         8.3.1.6. The primary and secondary maximum contaminant levels are published by the EPA (See
         40 CFR 141). ACC base environmental managers (BEEs and CEVs) should work closely together
         to achieve drinking water compliance. The expertise of the BEE to sample and identify problems,
         along with the expertise of the CEV to interface with the maintenance personnel can ensure all
         ACC personnel have adequate and safe drinking water.
      8.3.2. Underground Injection Control:
         8.3.2.1. Underground injection is regulated under the SDWA. "Underground injection" is defined
         as placing fluid underground through a well or dug-hole whose depth is greater than its width.
         This may include septic systems, cesspools or dry wells. This also applies to the reinjection of liq-
         uids from gas and oil production. It is ACC policy not to have underground injection wells.
         Whenever underground injection wells are found, HQ ACC/CEVQM shall be notified and plans
         will be made for the removal of the well.
         8.3.2.2. Underground injection wells are identified by five classes; Class I, industrial and munic-
         ipal disposal wells that inject below underground sources of drinking water; Class II, wells that
         inject fluid for oil and gas recovery; Class III, wells that inject for extraction of energy and miner-
         als; Class IV, wells that inject hazardous waste into or above underground sources of drinking
         water; and Class V, wells for alternative energy development and all other injection wells, includ-
         ing septic tanks.
         8.3.2.3. Wells excluded from coverage as underground injection wells include: wells for individ-
         ual and single-family residential waste disposal systems; non-residential septic systems for dis-
         posal of sanitary waste that serve fewer than 20 persons; wells for the injection of hydrocarbon
         gasses that are of pipeline quality; and holes dug that are not used to place fluids underground.
         These types of wells are excluded from coverage under the Federal regulations.
      8.3.3. Cross-Connection Control:
         8.3.3.1. A cross-connection is a link between a potable water system and non-potable water sys-
         tem. Backflow hazards occur when water flows through a cross-connection in a direction that it
         was not intended to flow. Safe drinking water requires adequate facilities and maintenance of the
         drinking water system, but ultimately overall management of the system is required to protect
         drinking water supplies. Part of this overall management includes cross-connection control pro-
         grams that provide both physical measures to prevent cross-connections and backflow manage-
         ment programs to identify potential contamination from occurring. Typically, state and local
         drinking water regulations are more stringent than federal regulations.
         8.3.3.2. There are two types of backflow: back pressure and back siphonage.
            8.3.3.2.1. Back pressure occurs when the non-potable source pressure is artificially increased
            to exceed the potable water pressure. This can occur through a rise in the non-potable pres-
            sure, a drop in the potable pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in non-potable pres-
            sure above potable water system pressure can be created, for instance, by booster pumps or
            temperature increases (e.g., in a boiler). A reduction in the potable water supply pressure can
            occur whenever water use (demand) exceeds the amount being supplied by the water purveyor.
            Examples of heavy water demand include water line flushing, fire fighting, or water main
            breaks. Smaller water demands, such as small water-line breaks, can reduce the supply line
            pressure sufficiently to create a backflow.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           125


         8.3.3.2.2. The other type of backflow is back siphonage. Back siphonage occurs when the
         supply line pressure falls below atmospheric pressure. In this situation, atmospheric pressure
         is creating a greater pressure on the non-potable system side in the reverse direction than the
         potable water system is maintaining in the normal direction of flow. Atmospheric pressure on
         the non-potable side forces a reversal of flow. Back siphonage is similar to back pressure sit-
         uations where the potable system pressure drops. However, for a backflow incident to be
         termed back siphonage, the potable system pressure must fall below atmospheric pressure.
     8.3.3.3. A wide variety of backflow prevention devices and methods are available for preventing
     back siphonage and back pressure backflows from adding contaminated fluids or gases into a
     potable water supply system. Generally, selection of the proper device is based upon the degree of
     hazard posed by the cross-connection. In addition, only backflow prevention devices (BPDs) that
     are approved by appropriate agencies should be used. BPDs are available from a number of man-
     ufacturers. The American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), Air Water Works Association
     (AWWA), Manual 14, and the Foundation of Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research
     (FCCC & HR) at the University of Southern California are the principal agencies who regularly
     publish the list of approved BPDs. AFI 32-1066 requires BPDs be approved by The International
     Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), but MAJCOMs may approve the
     installation of devices prior to IAPMO listing. HQ ACC/CEVQ requires all BPDs to be approved
     or listed by the public water system regulatory authority.
     8.3.3.4. Types of BPDs include: air gap, atmospheric vacuum breaker, pressure vacuum breaker,
     double check valve assembly, reduced pressure zone assembly and single check valve units.
     Backflow prevention methods consist of air gap separation, reduced pressure principle assembly,
     double check valve assembly, pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and atmospheric vacuum
     breaker assembly. Selection of a particular backflow method or device is dependent upon individ-
     ual site conditions such as the "degree of hazard" present. Refer to the references cited above and
     contact the base water and waste shop for selection of a particular device. The Base Backflow
     Prevention Manager establishes a schedule for testing and inspecting backflow devices. All
     assemblies shall be tested at the time of installation, repair, or relocation and at least on an annual
     schedule thereafter or more often when required by the local administrative authority.
     8.3.3.5. As part of the cross-connection program, every five years Base Civil Engineering person-
     nel survey all facilities and water using equipment to identify any potential cross-connections and
     the Base Bio-environmental Engineers assign potential hazard ranks. High hazard potential
     cross-connections should be corrected to protect the drinking water system integrity.
  8.3.4. Hydraulic Modeling at ACC Bases. If there is evidence of low pressure (<15 psi) or low
  chlorine residuals, which have the potential to adversely impact public health, a hydraulic model of
  the water supply system should be accomplished. The preferred ACC model is H2ONET although
  other models can be used. Contact HQ ACC/CEOI (Water and Wastewater POC) for further informa-
  tion and guidance.
  8.3.5. MTBE in Drinking Water. EPA is considering setting a federal standard for methyl tertiary
  butyl ether (MTBE) in drinking water. EPA announced on December 8, 1997, a revised Drinking
  Water Health and Consumer Acceptability Advisory for MTBE. The advisory recommends a range of
  20 to 40 ppb which is down from the 1992 advisory range of 20 to 200 ppb. ACC bases with ground-
  water sources should periodically test for the presence of MTBE compounds in raw water samples
  collected from each active well. Frequency of sampling should coincide with sampling requirements
126                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC's) and Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOC's) established by
      the primacy agency.
      8.3.6. Use of Bottled Water. Federal Register Vol. 63, No. 112, 11 Jun 98 revised 40 CFR 141.101
      to read that "Public water systems shall not use bottled water to achieve compliance with an MCL.
      Bottled water may be used on a temporary basis to avoid unreasonable risk to health." Consult with
      HQ ACC/CEVQ and SGPB prior to instituting a bottled water program at any ACC installation.
      8.3.7. Consumer Confidence Reports. The Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR) Final Rule was
      published in the 19 Aug 98 FR (Vol. 63 Number 160) and promulgated as 40 CFR 141, Subpart O.
      ACC uses the BEE SWARM database management program to fulfill this requirement with the base
      bioenvironmental engineer as the primary office of responsibility and the base environmental flight as
      the office of collateral responsibility. The rule requires every community water system (CWS) to pre-
      pare and provide customers an annual CCR. These CCRs are report cards that convey to consumers
      the quality of water delivered by the CWS (in this case the Air Force base) over the past year. CCRs
      detail a number of things including source of water, overall health of the water, contaminant levels for
      certain substances, and potential sources of contaminants. CCRs are due every year by 1 Jul and must
      contain an identification of the water source, a summary of susceptibility to contamination, instruc-
      tions for obtaining the complete source water assessment, the level of any contaminant found in local
      drinking water, with appropriate MCL, the likely source of the contaminant, the potential health
      effects of contaminants detected in violation of EPA Health Standards, with description of system's
      actions to restore safe levels, educational statement for vulnerable populations about avoiding
      Cryptosporidium, educational information on nitrate, arsenic, and lead when detected >50% of stan-
      dard, and must include phone numbers, to include the water system's and SDWA hotline. ACC bases
      use the DoD Consumer Confidence Report Guidance Document, Sep 99, for advice on procedures and
      policy to comply with the CCR reporting requirements.
      8.3.8. Wellhead Protection. The Wellhead Protection Program was established by the 1986 amend-
      ments to the SDWA. The program is implemented by state and local governments, with technical
      assistance from the EPA. The SDWAS requires that each state prepare a wellhead protection program
      and obtain approval of the plan from the EPA. Because state wellhead protection programs may
      impact land use and planning at ACC installations base environmental and engineering water manag-
      ers should contact appropriate state and/or EPA regional offices. Bases should incorporate state
      approved wellhead protection plans into their programs as appropriate to ensure the mission water
      supply is protected and continuous.
         8.3.8.1. The principal goal of wellhead protection is prevention of groundwater contamination.
         The state program should detail the responsibilities of state and local government agencies and
         public water suppliers, delineate wellhead protection areas, identify all potential sources of con-
         tamination, describe management approaches for funding and educating the public, outline contin-
         gency plans for providing alternative drinking water supplies, identify sites for future wells, and
         describe proposed actions to ensure public participation.
         8.3.8.2. A source of information for conducting watershed assessments can be found at EPA's
         internet homepage under the "Surf Your Watershed" at http://www.epa.gov/surf/. A source of
         ambient water quality information is the EPA's STOrage and RETrievel system (STORET). Sec-
         tion 305 (b) of the CWA requires states to report to the EPA on the quality of their waters. Much
         of the raw data reported by the states is stored in STORET, which is found on EPA's web site at
         http://www.epa.gov/OWOW/.

                                                Chapter 9

                               TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL ACT

9.1. General Requirements. Asbestos materials are regulated under 40 CFR 61 Subpart M, National
Emission Standards for Asbestos and under the Toxic Substance and Control Act of 1976 (TSCA), 15
U.S.C. 2601 et seq., and 40 CFR 763, Asbestos. Worker protection requirements are promulgated in 29
CFR 1910 and 1926. Lead-based paint standards are also published in 29 CFR 1910. Polychlorinated
Biphenyl (PCB) is regulated by 40 CFR 761. ACC bases must follow these Federal regulations at mini-
mum and must comply with local or state asbestos, PCB and lead-based paint regulations that may be
more restrictive. The objective of the Command asbestos, PCB, and lead-based paint programs are to
eliminate, to the extent possible, personnel exposure to Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM), PCBs,
lead-based paint by fully complying with environmental statutes and regulations at federal, state and local
levels.
   9.1.1. Responsibilities:
       9.1.1.1. HQ ACC/CEVQ is responsible for preparing and disseminating policy for environmental
       compliance, for asbestos/PCB/lead-based paint and other hazardous substances. CEVQ also pro-
       vides guidance on funding eligibility for asbestos, PCB, lead-based paint, and other hazardous
       substances.
       9.1.1.2. HQ ACC/CEO is responsible for policy to ensure installation civil engineering operations
       asbestos and lead-based paint workers comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
       tion (OSHA) standards 29 CFR 1910.1001, General Industry, 29 CFR 1910.1025, General Indus-
       try Lead Standard, and 29 CFR 1926.58, Construction Industry.
       9.1.1.3. ACC Installations. Each ACC Air Force base is required to follow the policies outlined
       in this manual and ensure in-house asbestos, PCB and lead-based paint workers receive the train-
       ing required by their respective state and Federal regulations, and comply with all regulatory
       requirements in the management of asbestos, lead-based paint and PCB materials.
   9.1.2. Policy Guidance. The policies contained in this chapter are mandatory for ACC installations.
   Portions of this policy which are optional or only recommendations are indicated.
   9.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
   requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
   provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
   sound engineering and/or environmental practices that maintain environmental compliance.
   9.1.4. Applicability. This policy is applicable to all ACC installations. Overseas locations will fol-
   low their respective Final Governing Standards (FGS) or Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance
   Document where no FGS exists.

9.2. Permits. There are no federal permit requirements associated with asbestos, lead-based paint, or
PCB work. However, there are notification requirements specific to each state and certain state specific
permits could be required. Environmental program managers must coordinate with state regulatory
asbestos and lead-based coordinators to ensure full compliance with applicable state regulations.
128                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


9.3. Asbestos Management. The presence or absence of ACM in a facility does not trigger any require-
ments under the asbestos NESHAP (40 CFR Part 61) to remove asbestos. The asbestos NESHAP directs
the work practices and notification requirements during asbestos abatement. Air Force policy is to man-
age confirmed and suspect asbestos containing materials in-place. An effective asbestos management
program can control the release of most situations where asbestos fibers exist. Removal can increase
occupant risk to exposure, significantly increase management costs, and shall be accomplished only when
absolutely necessary to support the mission or to eliminate unacceptable exposure risks.
      9.3.1. Installation-Wide Asbestos Surveys are not required by Air Force or ACC policy nor environ-
      mental regulation. Installation-wide asbestos surveys provide information about the location, type
      and quantities of ACM. Installation-wide asbestos surveys become less and less valuable with time,
      unless meticulous records of all renovation and maintenance/repair work is promptly and accurately
      posted. Installation-wide surveys are not eligible for ECP funding and should not be requested.
         9.3.1.1. Regulation 40 CFR 61.145(a) does require asbestos surveys in facilities prior to renova-
         tion or demolition work. This requirement is mandatory and is funded from the renovation or
         demolition project design or construction funds. Environmental flights may fund sampling and
         analysis from their EC accounts if the sampling is not associated with, or in anticipation of con-
         struction, demolition, renovation, maintenance, or repair work and where, working in conjunction
         with the installation bio-environmental engineer, there is concern for personnel exposure to asbes-
         tos fibers.
         9.3.1.2. Inspection of a facility to confirm or identify suspect asbestos containing materials to
         monitor the status of "left-in-place" asbestos containing materials is a valid pollution prevention
         expense. Inspection of a facility to confirm or identify suspect asbestos containing materials is not
         a valid environmental expense if the inspection is prompted in anticipation of, or a direct result of,
         planned renovation, maintenance, repair, construction or demolition project work.
      9.3.2. Surveys Prior to Renovation or Demolition. Asbestos surveys in facilities are required by 40
      CFR 61.145(a) prior to renovation or demolition work and are funded from the same program funding
      the work. When a large area is to be surveyed for ACM, a systematic and consistent survey protocol
      should be followed. Asbestos program managers may wish to follow the survey protocol published
      by the EPA for schools which is contained in 40 CFR 763.86, Subpart E, Asbestos-Containing Mate-
      rials in Schools. If this protocol is used to survey for asbestos, it is recommended the number of sam-
      ples taken be decreased to reduce costs and administration of the survey. If the survey is planned for
      regulatory compliance coordinate the planned sampling protocol with the appropriate state asbestos
      coordinator prior to start of the survey. If the sampling planned is to be used to evaluate personal
      exposure conditions, then fully coordinate the sampling plan with the base bio-environmental engi-
      neer and follow the AHERA sampling protocol strictly. Following a systematic and comprehensive
      survey, protocol will increase the likelihood of finding ACM if it is present.
      9.3.3. Contracted Asbestos Abatement. Contractor removal of ACM occurs during the execution of
      many ACC construction projects. Contracts that include asbestos work require, at minimum, the fol-
      lowing requirements as defined in Asbestos Abatement, March/April 1990 issue title, "A Guide to
      Necessary Plans and Specifications for Abatement Projects." (Table 9.1.):
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           129

       9.3.3.1. The base shall ensure qualified personnel are involved in reviewing contract documents
       to secure the inclusion of the items listed above. Also, each of the above items shall be part of the
       contractor's submittals prior to commencing work. These same items can be used to qualify the
       contractor to bid on the project. HQ AFCESA has provided training for Quality Assurance Eval-
       uators (QAE) in their AFMAN 64-108, QAE Training, that outlines minimum duties to ensure a
       successful asbestos abatement project.
       9.3.3.2. Construction management personnel must receive asbestos awareness training each year
       and at least one construction management person must receive the 4-day EPA approved asbestos
       supervisor/inspector training. Asbestos awareness training should consist of two to eight hours
       covering the following topics listed in Table 9.2. Records of all training completed will be main-
       tained.

   9.3.4. Air Force GRADE System. The Air Force Guidance for Rating and Assessing Damage and
   Exposure (GRADE) system was developed by the Air Force by USAF Occupational and Environ-
   mental Health Laboratory, Brooks AFB, Texas in August 1986 to provide a scoring and rating check-
   list for ACM. The asbestos GRADE system is limited to friable ACM and is intended for use as an
130                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      Air Force-wide asbestos abatement prioritization tool. Nonfriable asbestos cannot be scored by this
      rating system. It does not replace air sampling as the primary means of assessing asbestos exposure.
      Management actions are calculated after gathering survey statistics on the ACM in question and are
      presented in the form of hazard ranks ranging from one to six. Base asbestos managers and bioenvi-
      ronmental engineers should use these hazard ranks as a guide only and not as directives requiring
      immediate asbestos removal. When the Base Environmental Engineer (BEE) determines a GRADE
      hazard 1 exists, the BEE will decide whether or not the situation warrants a Risk Assessment Code.
         9.3.4.1. Further action for removal, encapsulation, or to do nothing is proposed by the asbestos
         program manager and the base environmental engineer to management for a final decision.
         9.3.4.2. The 1995 command-wide asbestos survey of housing and child care facilities was con-
         ducted scoring all sample results with the GRADE system. Two additional priorities, number 7
         and 8, were added by ACC for better management and characterization of materials that are sus-
         pect asbestos containing. The results of all samples were scored with one of the following priori-
         ties:
             9.3.4.2.1. Priority 1 through 6. Friable Asbestos.
             9.3.4.2.2. Priority 7. Asbestos, Non-Friable.
             9.3.4.2.3. Priority 8. Non-asbestos material.
             9.3.4.2.4. The Air Force GRADE system may be used to establish a priority ranking of ACM
             by building and for the base as a whole. Corrective actions required for friable ACM should
             include consultation with BEE staff for health risk assessments.
      9.3.5. ECP Funding for ACM Work:
         9.3.5.1. Funding. See Chapter 15 for a comprehensive summary of ECP funding eligibility for
         asbestos work. Generally ECP funding is limited to:
             9.3.5.1.1. ECP funds can be used to pay for sampling, and analysis to respond to a release, and
             for sampling and analysis of damaged, friable asbestos material to certify an immediate health
             hazard. Air monitoring of asbestos removal for emergency response activities can also be paid
             for with EC funding. ACC installations may not use EC funds for asbestos related activities
             not driven by an immediate health hazard or for asbestos related activities where routine mon-
             itoring under OSHA is the regulatory driver.
             9.3.5.1.2. Asbestos abatement funding is outlined in HQ USAF/ILE memorandum 25 Feb 99,
             Funding Clarification for Asbestos Related Activities. Environmental funding of asbestos
             abatement may be provided when the requirements of AFI 32-1052, Facility Asbestos Man-
             agement, and HQ USAL/ILE policy have been satisfied. These requirements require base
             managers must first attempt to manage the asbestos-containing materials in place (See AFI
             32-1052, paragraph 2.1 and 2.2). If the material is damaged friable asbestos which cannot be
             maintained, and the installation commander issues a "must remove" mandate per AFI 32-1052
             to correct a bio-environmental engineer documented immediate health hazard, not incidental
             to or in anticipation of a renovation, construction, or demolition project, then the asbestos
             abatement may be funded with environmental compliance dollars upon validation by HQ
             ACC/CEV. Base managers requesting asbestos abatement funding shall annotate in the
             ACES-PM narrative all the prerequisites above have been met. A written, must remove man-
             date statement by the installation commander, should be issued as a last resort after all practi-
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        131


        cal alternatives have been eliminated. Generally, asbestos abatement should be funded with
        non-environmental sources, typically maintenance, repair or project O&M, NAF, medical,
        housing or MILCON funds.
  9.3.6. Management and Operations Plans:
     9.3.6.1. An asbestos management plan and asbestos operating plan are required for all ACC bases
     per AFI 32-1052. The objective of the asbestos management plan is to maintain a permanent
     record of the current status and condition of all ACM in an installation's facility inventory. The
     management plan provides the documentation for all asbestos management efforts and procedures
     for overseeing the entire facility asbestos management program. The plan will include procedures
     to ensure installation personnel comply with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-
     tration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state and local regulations.
     9.3.6.2. The asbestos operating plan dictates how the base will carry out asbestos-related work.
     The plan assigns responsibilities; establishes inspection and repair capabilities; and provides
     repair procedures and personnel protection instructions. The plan will refer to and explain appli-
     cable OSHA and EPA rules; AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality; and AFI 91-301, The US Air
     Force Occupational Safety, Fire Prevention, and Health Program, with provisions for enforce-
     ment.
     9.3.6.3. Local environmental managers may combine the asbestos management and operations
     plans; however, the combined plan should contain separate sections to meet the distinctive and
     separate requirements of AFI 32-1052, paragraph 3.3.
     9.3.6.4. The preparation of asbestos management and operations plans should be accomplished
     by the combined efforts of installation environmental, occupational health and safety personnel.
     Where base resources are limited, environmental compliance funds may be used to contract this
     effort.
  9.3.7. Asbestos Abatement Sampling.
     9.3.7.1. Asbestos testing to determine personnel exposure is the primary responsibility of the
     BEE. However, construction projects require clearance samples before and after asbestos work to
     ensure the renovated work area is safe for use. The following is a brief summary of two types of
     sampling methodologies.
        9.3.7.1.1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is typically used for clearing samples
        before asbestos work is begun and after abatement is completed. TEM is used by the asbestos
        abatement contractor to demonstrate he has a clean site and it is ready to be turned over to the
        owner for use. It is required by Asbestos Hazardous Emergency Response Act (AHERA)
        which applies to schools only. It is not mandatory for other asbestos work. However, some
        type of clearing test is required for all work and TEM is accepted by regulators for this pur-
        pose. TEM is a qualitative and quantitative analytical method utilized to distinguish if parti-
        cles collected on a filter medium are asbestos and their density per unit area. TEM does not
        distinguish if the particle identified as asbestos is respirable, that is, small enough to become
        lodged in the respirable region of the lungs, and therefore harmful.
        9.3.7.1.2. Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM) is used to determine if airborne asbestos con-
        centrations of asbestos are potentially hazardous and if personal protective equipment is
        required. PCM is used for personnel monitoring and can be used for pre-abatement and after
132                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


             abatement clearing when approved by regulators. It does not identify the fibers it counts and
             counts all fibers longer than 5 micrometers and wider than about 0.25 micrometers.
         9.3.7.2. If an asbestos abatement job is planned, TEM could be used before abatement begins to
         determine background levels. Then use PCM to monitor personnel and project fiber levels during
         abatement. Next perform TEM again after all abatement and cleanups are done to demonstrate the
         site is clean and ready for occupancy. Follow the direction and regulations of local states where
         asbestos work is being performed.
         9.3.7.3. Comparing Sampling Results to Personal Exposure Limits and Asbestos Abatement Con-
         struction Standards. There are several standards published by OSHA as personal exposure limits
         and by EPA for asbestos abatement clearance standards. These limits and standards were promul-
         gated to protect personnel from unacceptable exposure to asbestos fibers. Prior to any sampling,
         the BEE and BCE environmental compliance manager should understand these limits and stan-
         dards clearly. The following provides a summary of the key limits and standards. Refer to the ref-
         erences regulations for specific and more detailed explanations.
             9.3.7.3.1. Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). This is an OSHA standard found in 29 CFR
             1926.1101. The limit is an 8-hour time-weighted-average PEL of 0.1 fibers/cubic centimeters
             for all asbestos work in all industries.
             9.3.7.3.2. Excursion Limit. An asbestos excursion limit above which no employee should be
             exposed equivalent to an airborne concentration of asbestos in excess of 1.0 fiber/cubic centi-
             meter of air as averaged over a sampling period of 30 minutes.
             9.3.7.3.3. Standard to Determine if an Abatement Area is Adequately Clean. Asbestos
             Hazardous Emergency Response Act (AHERA) was promulgated to protect the U.S. schools
             from the effects of asbestos and codified in 40 CFR 763, Subpart E. This regulation provides
             the framework for inspection, sampling, analysis, assessment, hazard response, O&M, train-
             ing, planning and record keeping for asbestos in schools. Although originally written as appli-
             cable only to the nations schools, because they are not been other protocols for clearance
             sampling promulgated, most regulatory agencies accept this methodology. When an abate-
             ment project is completed AHERA uses 70 asbestos structures per square millimeter as the
             standard to determine if the area is adequately clean prior to re-occupancy. The standard states
             the area passes if the arithmetic mean of all the samples is less than or equal to 70 asbestos
             structures per square millimeter of filter area, which in volumetric terms is approximately 0.01
             fibers per cubic centimeters. Transmission electron microscopy examination of samples (see
             paragraph 9.3.7.1.1.) is required to determine if this standard has been met.
      9.3.8. Demolition Involving Asbestos. See 40 CFR 61.145, Standard for Demolition and Renova-
      tion Projects Involving Asbestos Materials. EPA's guide to demolition is found in their publication
      EPA-320/1-92-013, A Guide to Normal Demolition Practices Under the Asbestos NESHAP, and an
      EPA memorandum from the Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Division, Office of Compli-
      ance dated 29 Jun 1994, Asbestos NESAHP Demolition Decision Tree Guidance Document. Both of
      these documents provide national policy on both normal and unique demolition projects.
         9.3.8.1. The decision tree document was designed to help regulatory inspectors decide which of
         the regulatory requirements may be applicable to a given demolition. ACC asbestos managers
         responsible for demolition decision should be familiar with the decision tree matrix. A thorough
         inspection by a qualified asbestos inspector must be conducted prior to any demolition work. This
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        133


     inspection must identify all asbestos containing materials present and quantities to be affected. If
     regulated ACM exists in quantities above the threshold amount, all the material must be removed
     prior to demolition. If suspect materials are discovered during demolition that was previously
     inaccessible, they must be sampled and analyzed for its asbestos content when the combined
     amount of suspect material is above the threshold amount. If the materials test greater than
     one-percent asbestos, all of the material must be removed following appropriate NESHAP con-
     tainment rules.
  9.3.9. Asbestos Abatement Projects:
     9.3.9.1. Each base-level asbestos manager must obtain approvals from local regulatory agencies
     prior to beginning any demolition work that contains asbestos materials. Failure to notify State
     regulatory agencies of asbestos abatement projects can result in enforcement actions. AFCEE's
     Eastern Regional Office has prepared summaries of state-specific asbestos abatement notification
     requirements. Most states require a 10-day written notification.
  9.3.10. ACM in Wallboard Systems:
     9.3.10.1. ACM is often found in joint compound (mud) used in the taping and bedding of
     sheet-rock. Many projects have erroneously assumed any material, which samples at greater than
     1 percent asbestos must be handled in accordance with the Asbestos NESHAP rule. The EPA pro-
     vided a clarification on the interpretation of applicability of the Asbestos NESHAP rule to wall-
     board in the Federal Register, Volume 50, No. 3, 5 January 1994, Asbestos NESHAP Clarification
     Regarding Analysis of Multi-layered Systems. As stated in the Federal Register, "this notice is
     intended solely as guidance and does not represent an action subject to judicial review." Accord-
     ingly, our interpretation of this guidance that follows must be approved by the state where its
     application is used.
     9.3.10.2. This rule suggests when "joint compound and/or tape is applied to a wallboard it
     becomes an integral part of the wallboard and in effect becomes one material forming a wall sys-
     tem. Therefore, where a demolition or renovation impacts such a wall system, a composite analy-
     sis of the joint compound, tape and wallboard should be conducted. If the analysis shows an
     asbestos content of greater than one percent and at least 160 square feet of the wall system is
     involved in the demolition or renovation activities (whether planned or unplanned, during a calen-
     dar year), then the activities would be subject to the asbestos NESHAP."
     9.3.10.3. Within EPA and OSHA region III, composite material is rarely regulated as ACM. The
     following method may be used to determine if a material is regulated ACM. Ensure regulator
     agencies concur with this method if used prior to beginning work.
     9.3.10.4. A "composite analysis" must be taken of the wallboard in question. ACC interprets this
     to mean a sample, completely through the material front to back, which is taken in a location that
     is "representative" of most of the wallboard system. This means it does not have to be taken at the
     joint or corner. Multiple samples should be taken of representative areas.
     9.3.10.5. The percent joint compound is estimated by volume for the composite. For example, if
     a 1" x 1" sample was taken of a ½" thick sheet rock wall and the joint compound, front and back
     represented 1/16" in thickness, and the asbestos in the joint compound was 4 percent asbestos
     material, then the percent joint compound for the composite sample would be .44 percent. (The
     total thickness of the material is 1/2" plus the joint compound 1/16" or a total thickness of 9/16".
     Therefore, 1" x 1"x 9/16" = 9/16 in3. The joint compound is then 1/16" divided by 9/16" or 11 per-
134                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         cent of the material. If the asbestos bulk sample returns an asbestos content of 4 percent, then the
         total asbestos material in the composite sample is .04 x .11 = .0044 or .44 percent.) Asbestos
         material content less than one percent is not subject to the asbestos NESHAP regulation.
      9.3.11. ACM in Vehicle Brakes. The guidance following applies to all vehicle maintenance activi-
      ties at each ACC base. This includes vehicle maintenance shops, auto hobby shops, AAFES gas sta-
      tion shops, and other facilities where brake and clutch maintenance may occur.
         9.3.11.1. The regulatory guidance applicable to this type maintenance activity is found at Appen-
         dix F to Title 29 CFR 1910.1001, Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Automotive Brake
         Repair Operations, effective 11 October 1994. It mandates specific engineering controls and
         work practices that must be implemented by those who inspect, disassemble, repair, and assemble
         brakes and clutches. Proper use of the engineering controls and work practices will reduce
         employees' asbestos exposure below the permissible exposure level during clutch and brake main-
         tenance. The rule also specifies procedures for working with brakes and clutches that contain
         asbestos materials.
         9.3.11.2. The first order of business for any ACC maintenance shop is to determine if the brake or
         clutch they are servicing contains asbestos materials. Generally the manufacturer's labeling is suf-
         ficient documentation to determine whether the asbestos worker protection regulations apply. If
         the status of the brake or clutch is unknown, then it must be handled as presumed asbestos contain-
         ing materials (see 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1910.1101).
         9.3.11.3. The EPA reversed its position on the ban of manufacturing automotive clutch and brake
         linings containing asbestos materials (See 58 FR 58964, 5 Nov 93). Hence it is important to ascer-
         tain from manufacturers whether their products contain asbestos materials. ACC/CEVQ recom-
         mends that non-asbestos containing brakes be purchased whenever possible. In 1993 the Defense
         Logistics Agency published an internal policy to not purchase brakes which contain asbestos
         materials (PROACT File No: 5369, 11 April 1995). However, since there is no ban on the manu-
         facturer of brake lining with materials containing asbestos, it is necessary to either analyze bulk
         samples or obtain a manufacturer certification that the brakes are asbestos free.
         9.3.11.4. The following summarizes the key elements or procedures that must be followed to
         comply with OSHA and environmental regulations relative to brakes containing asbestos materi-
         als.
             9.3.11.4.1. Engineering controls and good work practices must be followed at all times.
             Workers must be protected utilizing a negative pressure enclosure/HEPA (High Efficiency
             Particulate Air) filter and vacuum system, a low-pressure wet cleaning method or an equiva-
             lent method. See 29 CFR 1910.1001. (NOTE: If the brakes being serviced do not contain
             ACM, then the asbestos OSHA worker protection procedures do not apply).
             9.3.11.4.2. Disposal of brakes containing asbestos materials is regulated by 40 CFR 61.150.
             Brake pads are not specifically regulated, but within ACC all pads with known asbestos con-
             taining materials will be double bagged, labeled as ACM, and disposed of in approved asbes-
             tos landfills. The base asbestos manager or coordinator should provide specific procedures on
             the disposal methods for solid waste containing ACM. Some states allow ACM brake pads to
             be disposed of as solid waste. Check with your state asbestos coordinator for specific rules in
             the area where your base is located. A states written guidance (either by letter or by published
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         135


         regulation) allowing disposal in a solid waste landfill may be followed in lieu of ACC/CEVQ's
         policy above.
         9.3.11.4.3. A training program is required for employees who are exposed to airborne concen-
         trations of asbestos at or above the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and/or excursion limit.
         (The time-weighted average limit PEL is 0.1 fiber/cc in an 8 hour period. The excursion limit
         follows that no employee shall be exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos in excess
         of 1.0 fibers/cc as averaged over a sampling period of 30 minutes). Asbestos clutch and brake
         work is OSHA Class IV asbestos work. See paragraph 9.3.17. for a description of training
         requirements.
         9.3.11.4.4. Purchase. It is HQ ACC/LGT policy not to purchase vehicle brakes that contain
         asbestos except when alternative materials are unavailable.
         9.3.11.4.5. Program Management. The base asbestos manager or coordinator must ensure
         AAFES, Services, Transportation, contract and other vehicle maintenance shops are familiar
         with the above procedures and comply with the appropriate regulations while servicing brakes
         which contain asbestos materials.
  9.3.12. Safes Containing Asbestos Insulation:
     9.3.12.1. Utilization. Safes that contain asbestos materials, where there are no exposed asbestos
     materials, may be used as designed. It is not necessary to replace a safe simply because it has
     asbestos insulating materials. Safes which do not have completely enclosed steel jacketing where
     asbestos materials can be scraped or abraded (some very old safes were made with the asbestos
     materials exposed on the interior of the safe) should be replaced. Safes that are used and contain
     asbestos insulating materials should be labeled for locksmiths who may have occasion to drill
     through casings to unlock or render a safe unusable. If the asbestos content of the safe is
     unknown, the manufacturer should be contacted. If the manufacturer is not available, the safe
     should be assumed to contain asbestos materials.
     9.3.12.2. Disposal. Safes which are removed from service, but still have its steel jacketing intact
     completely enclosing the asbestos materials, may be disposed of as solid waste. Disposal in a state
     approved asbestos landfill is only required if asbestos materials are friable, and therefore, a Regu-
     lated Asbestos Containing Material (RACM) subject to the disposal procedures contained in the
     National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) regulations (40 CFR
     61.154). The safe to be disposed should be labeled as containing asbestos materials. The safe
     should not be disposed of at any landfill operation that crushes its waste prior to disposal or would
     otherwise disassemble the safe exposing the asbestos materials. Contact your state asbestos regu-
     lator for specific guidance and approval to follow this disposal procedure. Some states have more
     restrictive disposal policies than this.
  9.3.13. Asbestos Bulletin Board System. In order to help our customers in identifying asbes-
  tos-containing items and determining if a non-asbestos replacement is available, DISC has set up an
  Asbestos Bulletin Board System. These data are now available to anyone with a computer and
  modem at DSN 442-2340 or Commercial (215) 697-2340. The database contains more than 13,000
  National Stock Numbers (NSNs) in Federal Supply Classes (FSCs) 5330, 5310, 5340, and 6145.
  DISC has already identified 3,000 non-asbestos replacements.
  9.3.14. Asbestos Landfills. It is ACC policy not to create new on-base asbestos landfills. Disposal
  of ACM will only be completed in state permitted and approved asbestos landfills. When transporting
136                                    ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      ACM to any disposal location, it is important that the drivers of the vehicles be properly trained in cor-
      rect waste handling procedures. The driver is responsible for retaining all dump receipts, trip tickets,
      transportation manifests, or other documentation of disposal. These must then be given to the envi-
      ronmental management office as the owner of the records. Waste manifest must be provided to the
      environmental office at time of creation. Within 35 days, receipt of the manifest from the landfill of
      disposal must be received to be in compliance with 40 CFR 61, Subpart M. The landfill is required to
      maintain records of all asbestos disposal annotating location and other characteristics of the disposal
      action. ACC environmental managers should be sure the landfill used for Air Force disposed property
      is maintaining proper records in accordance with the state permit for that landfill.
      9.3.15. Asbestos in Hospitals:
         9.3.15.1. Management. Asbestos is managed in hospitals as in other Air Force facilities. The
         base Asbestos Management and Operations Plans shall include the hospital facility. Asbestos will
         be managed in place or removed in accordance with the requirements provided in AFI 32-1052.
         The management of asbestos at the base hospital may be accomplished by hospital maintenance,
         civil engineering in-service, or contract personnel. Whoever manages the materials must fulfill
         the requirements of AFI 32-1052, state, OSHA and EPA asbestos regulations, and perform the
         appropriate surveys, sampling, record keeping and coordination to ensure all asbestos materials
         are managed to protect facility occupants and maintenance personnel from exposure above the
         Personal Exposure Limit (PEL). All asbestos work must be performed by licensed or state certi-
         fied asbestos workers in accordance with the asbestos regulations in the state of residence.
         9.3.15.2. Funding. The hospital funds all maintenance, repair, and construction for their facility
         through special SG accounts. This includes all asbestos management and operations activities.
         Work performed by others (e.g., civil engineering) is reimbursable. While HQ ACC/CEV has
         funds for emergency removal of asbestos materials these dollars cannot be used in the hospital,
         except on a reimbursable basis.
         9.3.15.3. Contracted Maintenance. For those hospitals that contract asbestos management, the
         requirements are the same as outlined above. The contract specification shall specify the contrac-
         tor will provide access to all records for review by the base BEE or CE offices. The items to be
         included in the contract specifications outlined in paragraph 9.3.3. should be complied with. Be
         sure to include in the specifications that copies of asbestos abatement results, surveys, sampling
         results, and other pertinent data will be provided to the host installation CE and BEE offices upon
         requests and upon completion of asbestos projects.
         9.3.15.4. Maintaining Information. The BEE and CE offices will provide initial information to
         the contractor regarding known asbestos materials and conditions in the hospital prior to the start
         of contracted asbestos maintenance. This information should be the most current available and
         include historical information. No new surveys or sampling should be completed in preparation
         for this contract. If surveys or sampling are required, they should be included as part of the asbes-
         tos maintenance contract. The contractor should be responsible for maintaining asbestos informa-
         tion after the initial data is provided by the base at the beginning of the contract.
         9.3.15.5. Funding. If the base currently manages an asbestos maintenance/abatement contract,
         the hospital can be included in this contract if desired. However, funding for the hospital must be
         provided for separately on an AF Form 9, Purchase Request, and all contractor-incurred
         expenses billed and paid separately from the hospital account.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                       137


     9.3.15.6. Contracting Alternatives. For those bases where hospital maintenance has been con-
     tracted and the specifications do not include asbestos management, the base has several alterna-
     tives. First, the contract can be modified to include asbestos management, second the base can
     contract asbestos management separately, or lastly, the base may arrange for civil engineering
     in-service asbestos management. In each case the hospital pays for the asbestos management
     directly or reimburses civil engineering for work performed. Within ACC, the Command policy
     is to modify the existing contracts to include asbestos management. Bases wishing to perform the
     asbestos management in hospital utilizing in-service maintenance personnel on a reimbursable
     basis should request approval from HQ ACC/CEO.
  9.3.16. Property Transfer. The Air Force is required by law to ensure the removal of hazards prior
  to a property transfer to another non-Air Force agency. Asbestos hazards may be at minimum friable
  material which cannot be maintained in place. The hazard may be mitigated by physical removal,
  encapsulation, or can be passed to the gaining property owner by mutual written consent.
  9.3.17. The following partial training classifications and requirements list from PROACT Fact Sheet
  TI#19400, Mar 99, provides an overview of classes and categories of training specified in the Title 29
  CFR standards.
     9.3.17.1. OSHA has established four classifications of asbestos work.
         9.3.17.1.1. Class I means activities involving the removal of thermal system insulation (TSI)
         and sprayed-on, troweled-on, or otherwise applied surfacing ACM.
         9.3.17.1.2. Class II means activities involving the removal of any other ACM that is not TSI
         or surfacing ACM. This includes, but is not limited to, the removal of asbestos-containing
         wallboard, floor tile, and siding shingles.
         9.3.17.1.3. Class III means repair and maintenance operations where ACM, including TSI and
         surfacing ACM may be disturbed. Examples of Class III asbestos work include disturbance
         and repair of small amounts of pipe insulation in the course of repairing a leaking valve,
         removal of small amounts of an ACM wall to repair electrical wiring, and removal of old win-
         dow glazing to facilitate repair or painting of windows.
         9.3.17.1.4. Class IV means maintenance and custodial construction activities during which
         employees contact, but do not disturb ACM, and activities to clean up waste and debris con-
         taining ACM. Examples include sweeping floors, working around electrical outlets and
         switch plates, dusting and vacuuming in areas where ACM pipes insulation is present and
         repairing or replacing of brakes or clutches.
     9.3.17.2. The training required by workers performing the classes mentioned above are:
         9.3.17.2.1. General Awareness. Two hours of training annually must be completed by per-
         sonnel who perform Class IV asbestos work.
         9.3.17.2.2. Operations and Maintenance. Sixteen hours of training shall be completed by
         personnel who perform Class III asbestos work. Annual refresher training is required, but no
         minimum number of hours is specified. The "competent person" makes the final determina-
         tion of the level of training required for operations and maintenance personnel.
         9.3.17.2.3. Asbestos Abatement Worker. Thirty-two hours of training must be completed
         by personnel who perform Class I and Class II asbestos work. Class I and II asbestos work
138                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


             includes removal or encapsulation of ACM when the project is being performed with the sole
             intent of abatement of asbestos. Eight hours of refresher training are required annually for cer-
             tification to be maintained.
             9.3.17.2.4. Asbestos Contractor / Supervisor. Forty hours of training must be completed by
             personnel who supervise Class I and II asbestos work. Eight hours of refresher training are
             required annually for certification to be maintained.
             9.3.17.2.5. Asbestos Inspector. Training must be completed by personnel who perform
             building inspection for ACM including such tasks as measurement, quantification, physically
             touching, or collecting bulk samples of building materials. Initial training consist of a 3-day
             (24-hour) inspector course given by an EPA or State approved training center, depending on
             local requirements. Four hours of refresher training are required annually for certification to
             be maintained.
             9.3.17.2.6. Asbestos Management Planner. All persons who prepare management plans
             must be accredited. All persons seeking accreditation as a management planners shall com-
             plete a 3-day inspector training course as outlined above and a 2-day (16 hour) management
             planner training course. Possession of current and valid inspector accreditation is a prerequi-
             site for admission in the management planner training course. Four hours of refresher training
             are required annually for certification to be maintained.
             9.3.17.2.7. Asbestos Project Designer. Individuals who design any of the following activi-
             ties with respect to friable ACM in an school or public and commercial building, must com-
             plete accredited project designer training: (1) A response action other than a small scale short
             duration maintenance activity, (2) a maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACM other than
             a small scale short duration maintenance activity, or (3) a response action for a major fiber
             release episode. All personnel seeking accreditation as a project designer shall complete at
             least a minimum 3-day training course. Eight hours of annual refresher training must be com-
             pleted to maintain accreditation.

9.4. Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB).
      9.4.1. PCB Guidance. Under the Toxic Substance and Control Act of 1976, the EPA promulgated
      regulations for the manufacture, use, marking, storage, disposal, and cleanup of PCBs. This guidance
      has been developed in accordance with the PCB management regulations detailed in 40 CFR 761;
      state regulations were not considered in the development of this guidance package, but must be fol-
      lowed by the installation. This guidance applies to all ACC bases, even those that have met the Air
      Force's "PCB-Free" goal. In order to maintain auditable records of installation PCB status, each ACC
      installation shall indefinitely maintain documentation on past removal and disposal of PCB items, and
      current inventories and sampling records.
         9.4.1.1. The Air Force emphasis to become "PCB-Free" was published in a HQ USAF/ILE mem-
         orandum dated 27 Nov 95, to remove "large" transformers and capacitors containing greater than
         50 ppm PCBs on or before 31 Dec 98. The Air Force "PCB Free" goal is defined as real property
         installed equipment, specifically transformers and capacitors with greater than 3 pounds of fluid
         containing liquid PCBs at concentrations equal to or greater than 50 ppm. ACC installations
         reported "PCB-Free" on 22 Dec 98. However, there are still PCB items such as switches and reg-
         ulators on bases that require management.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                            139


     9.4.1.2. Locations of PCB items. PCB fluid is located in electrical power distribution systems.
     The most likely power equipment containing PCBs are transformers, capacitors, switch gear,
     switches, ballast, and other smaller sealed electrical equipment items. These items, containing the
     larger amounts of dielectric fluids used as coolant, present the greatest liability if spilled or leaked.
     While less likely, PCBs can turn up in almost any oil or oil based substance. PCBs have been
     identified in used oils, hydraulic oils, penetration oils, asphalt coatings on underground tanks and
     other traditionally non-PCB items.
     9.4.1.3. PCBs are only regulated in concentrations of 50 ppm and above. Fluids that are below 50
     ppm of PCB are not regulated by the EPA, and are not subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 761
     or this guidance. Some states do regulate items below 50 ppm, review your state regulations care-
     fully. It is ACC policy, if in doubt, sample and analyze.
     9.4.1.4. Hydraulic systems containing PCBs are banned (40 CFR 761.30(e)). If hydraulic sys-
     tems have not already been tested this must be done. If they contain PCBs greater than 50 ppm,
     they must be replaced.
  9.4.2. Program Requirements:
     9.4.2.1. Inventories and Testing. Inventory all base power system electrical equipment and have
     data provided to include item descriptions, base locations, sizes, manufacturers, serial numbers,
     and other pertinent information.
         9.4.2.1.1. Perform sampling and laboratory analysis of all non-sealed items. The Chlor-n-Oil
         sampling kits have been proven unreliable; if base wide equipment sampling has been limited
         to Chlor-n-Oil testing, a program must be implemented to retest all suspected PCB equipment
         using a certified laboratory. During this inspection, the surface to the equipment should be
         examined and any residue on the exterior of the equipment should be noted. Residue on the
         exterior constitutes a leaking transformer and should be replaced immediately as a level 1 ECP
         requirement. Installations should make an ACES-PM entry for the survey and request fund-
         ing. The narrative should state that the survey is required for an accurate inventory as required
         by 40 CFR 761.
         9.4.2.1.2. If possible, obtain written manufacturer certification for all sealed items. If infor-
         mation on sealed items is not available, they will be removed through attrition and assumed to
         be PCB until they are sampled prior to disposal or disposed of as PCB items. Small unidenti-
         fied sealed items will not be considered in the "PCB-free" calculation. Sealed unidentifiable
         items should be removed through attrition and assumed to be PCB until they are sampled prior
         to disposal. Small sealed items will not be considered in the "PCB-free" calculation.
     9.4.2.2. Replacement. Develop a replacement program. Program PCB electrical system replace-
     ment projects in a phased manner based on the base's electrical circuits and operating systems.
     Ensure replacement projects consider all existing and future demands; size the new equipment to
     adequately meet these demands. Specify non-PCB equipment in the replacement contracts. Bases
     should request manufacturer certification documents be provided on each new equipment item.
     Ensure all new items are properly labeled as "non-PCB" before installation.
     9.4.2.3. Inspections. Develop and conduct a regular inspection schedule to ensure in service and
     stored for disposal PCB items are examined for leakage until the replacement projects are under
     construction or all items have been disposed of. Place PCB spill absorbent kits nearby to allow for
     proper and timely response to leaks. Document inspections on a standardized checklist.

      9.4.3. Marking of PCB and PCB Items:
         9.4.3.1. All equipment will be marked in accordance with 40 CFR 761 Subpart C. All equipment
         that tests positive for PCBs, or is suspected of containing PCBs, will be labeled as PCB (>500
         ppm) or PCB-contaminated (>50 & <500 ppm). Affix the appropriate labels/stickers on all items.
         Include additional data on the labels such as sample number, month/year taken, and analysis
         results. Use spray paint stencils to affix this information if no labels are available. To prevent
         confusion in the future, ensure all non-PCB items are also labeled as such if analysis results or
         manufacturer's certification letters are available and on file.
         9.4.3.2. In addition to PCB equipment, labels must be affixed to all PCB containers, storage areas,
         and transport vehicles.
      9.4.4. Storage and Disposal:
         9.4.4.1. PCBs must be stored in a conforming storage facility that meets the requirements of 40
         CFR 761 Subpart D. All PCB items must be disposed of within one year from the date they were
         first placed into storage.
         9.4.4.2. PCB storage areas must have adequate roof and walls to prevent rainwater from contact-
         ing stored items. The floor must have continuous curbing a minimum of six inches high with a
         volume two times the capacity of the largest PCB Article or Container stored within, or 25 percent
         of the total of all the PCB Articles and Containers stored within, whichever is greater. The floor
         and curbing must be made of impervious materials and not have any drains or expansion joints.
         9.4.4.3. Certain PCB items may be stored for up to thirty days in a facility that does not conform
         to the aforementioned requirements, provided the items are properly marked with the date they
         were taken out of service, and meet the requirements of 40 CFR 761.65.
         9.4.4.4. Final disposal must be through the DRMO to a licensed disposal facility that meets the
         requirements of 40 CFR 761.60. Ensure that the project scope to replace PCB items includes
         proper incineration of PCB and PCB contaminated items (including carcasses). Manifests should
         be returned to the base to document their destruction.
         9.4.4.5. DRMO prefers to landfill the equipment rather than incinerate the PCB materials and
         recycle the scrap metal. USAF/CEV and ACC/CEV encourage recycling and suggest that base
         personnel discourage DRMO from disposing of equipment in landfills. We have requested that
         USAF/CEV write to DRMS, stating the Air Force preference for recycling.
      9.4.5. Record Keeping and Reporting:
         9.4.5.1. In keeping with the requirements of 40 CFR 761.180, records shall be maintained for
         each calendar year that includes the following:
            9.4.5.1.1. All signed manifests generated by the facility during the calendar year.
            9.4.5.1.2. All Certificates of Disposal that have been received by the facility during the calen-
            dar year.
            9.4.5.1.3. PCB manifests records are retained for 3 years from the date the PCB waste was
            accepted by the initial transporter. While not required by environmental regulation it is ACC
            policy to keep records of all tested in-use equipment for the life of the equipment. Records of
            tested non-PCB containing equipment will be kept for 3 years after removal or replacement.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          141


    9.4.5.2. In addition, an annual document log shall be maintained for at least three years after the
    facility is no longer used that includes the following:
       9.4.5.2.1. The name, address, and EPA identification number of the facility covered by the
       annual document log and the calendar year covered by the annual document log.

      9.4.6. USTs With PCB Coating.
         9.4.6.1. During removals, USTs have been found to have coal tar coatings, coal tar impregnated
         asbestos felt and paint containing PCBs. The PCB concentrations have ranged from 200 to 600
         ppm. The coatings were applied as water proofing materials and the PCBs were added intention-
         ally. Any tanks manufactured prior to 1982 with this type of coating should be tested for PCBs
         prior to disposal. If removing multiple USTs, randomly sample them, if PCBs are detected, then
         test all of tanks in the project. If the PCBs are present, notify your state and EPA Regional regula-
         tors, mark the items as PCB and immediately address storage until disposal is complete. If no
         PCBs are found, proceed with disposal in accordance with state regulations for disposal of under-
         ground storage tanks.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           143


     9.4.6.2. Minuteman II USTs containing non-liquid PCBs coatings. Federal regulation 40 CFR
     761 never intended to address storage of USTs with non-liquid PCBs, however in a Compliance
     Agreement (CA) between the USAF and EPA, 17 November 1995, provisions were included for
     storage of USTs with non-liquid PCBs coatings. Although the CA only applies to USTs associated
     with Minuteman II Dismantlement under START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), it has set a
     precedent. If an ACC installation encounters similar UST conditions it may be possible to pro-
     pose to regulators the specific language and reference of this CA. Copies of the CA can be pro-
     vided to installations on request from HQ ACC/CEVQM.
     9.4.6.3. If PCBs are present on USTs, there are two options for disposal:
         9.4.6.3.1. Disposal in a chemical waste landfill (CWL) presents the lowest risk for future lia-
         bility. The UST is sent to the landfill intact. They cannot be cut due to the probable release of
         dioxins from the burning PCBs.
         9.4.6.3.2. Remove the coating (PCB coal tar and PCB Paint) and ship for smelting. This
         option poses a number of potential problems. First, to remove the coating, a permit must be
         obtained from EPA. To obtain the permit, a safety and health plan and a work plan must be
         developed and submitted. To physically remove the coating, the area must be contained, the
         ground covered with plastic, then a tent built around the UST to prevent chips from leaving the
         area. The coating material would then be chipped off (cold), collected, properly marked,
         stored and disposed. Surface wipe tests on the tank surface must show results of less than 10
         ppm. This number should be agreed upon with EPA in the work plan prior to start of work.
         Once the tank is certified clean, it would be transported and smelted. At this point the UST
         could be cut to transport if required. No other "use" for the UST, after it is clean, is authorized.
         This should also be agreed upon with EPA in the work plan prior to start of work. USTs coated
         with PCB coal tar impregnated asbestos felt create an additional liability. All air issues relat-
         ing to asbestos must be addressed. First, get a ruling from the regulator, usually the state, if the
         coating is friable or non-friable asbestos. In the MMII projects, two states were involved. One
         state determined the asbestos was non-friable and one state determined it was friable. The
         state with the friable asbestos issued a notice of violation to the contractor who was removing
         the coating for asbestos violations.
     9.4.6.4. The actual costs for the two disposal options are comparable. Landfill and transportation
     costs are high, but the removals, especially with asbestos considerations, are equally high. Either
     option is acceptable.
  9.4.7. PCB "Mega-Rule". On 29 Jun 98 the EPA promulgated the Disposal of Polychlorinated
  Biphenyls (PCBs); Final Rule. The EPA states in the preamble that, "rulemaking is intended to pro-
  tect against unreasonable risks from PCBs by providing cost-effective and environmentally protective
  disposal options…". Environmental managers must review the rule and determine local regulatory
  applications, however, in summary the rule mandates the notification of landfill operators when dis-
  posing of non-liquid PCB containing materials and requires registration of PCB (greater than 500
  ppm) transformers with EPA by 28 Dec 98 (advise ACC/CEV if an ACC base believes they have a
  unit of this type).
  9.4.8. Additional Considerations:
     9.4.8.1. Missile sites represent unique problems with extensive use of electrical equipment. As
     with all Air Force electrical equipment, missile site equipment will be tested for the presence of
144                               ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      PCBs if possible. Small pieces of equipment that cannot be tested without damage to the item will
      be assumed to be PCB and labeled as such. These items will be tested or disposed of as PCB when
      they are removed from service at the end of their useful life or during missile site deactivation.
      This information applies to tenant units and all other functional areas on or off base as well.
      9.4.8.2. PCBs have been found in other products as well. Hydraulic oils, vacuum pump oils, and
      microscopic oils have all commonly used PCBs in the past. Unexpected PCBs have also been
      identified in other products as well. One item that represents a unique environmental problem is a
      corrosion resistant coating on underground storage tanks (USTs). It is ACC policy to test an
      unknown oil type product, like waste oils, solvents, sludges or materials contaminated with waste
      oils, for PCBs prior to disposal. Disposal of small capacitors with less than 3 pounds of dielectric
      fluid in not a valid EC funding requirement.
      9.4.8.3. Light Ballasts. Current Air Force policy is to dispose of small quantities of light ballasts
      and small capacitors in solid waste land fills. EPA is aware that the potting material in these elec-
      trical items may be impregnated with solid PCBs. EPA's proposed PCB's rule from Dec 94 used
      the number of 25 light ballasts per year as a baseline for collecting and disposal as PCB material.
      The EPA reiterated this guidance in the preamble to the 29 Jun 98 PCB disposal final rule. Since
      PCB production was banned in 1978 electrical equipment manufactured prior to that date might
      contain PCBs. There is the potential for multiple light ballasts or small capacitors to exceed the
      CERCLA reportable quantity of 1 pound for PCBs. The prudent course of action is to collect old
      light ballast and small capacitors in a 55-gallon drum in PCB conforming storage and dispose of
      them as a PCB waste. The following is the EPA's guidance contained in the preamble to the 29
      Jun 98 PCB Disposal Rule. The guidance has been modified to relate the information to ACC
      installations.
         9.4.8.3.1. ACC bases are not required to remove fluorescent light ballasts prior to the end of
         their useful life. However, if an installation plans to change out fluorescent light ballasts, for
         example, for re-lamping the building for energy conservation, and would like to know the
         applicable disposal requirements, the EPA has provided the following two suggestions. First,
         assume that the potting material in the fluorescent light ballasts contains PCBs at 50 ppm or
         greater and dispose of them as PCB waste. Second, conduct a survey of the manufacturer and
         type of ballasts in use in the building and develop a random sampling plan for each manufac-
         turer and type of ballast found and analyze the samples for PCBs. If no PCBs are found and
         the PCB small capacitors are intact and non-leaking, then the ballasts could be disposed of in
         a municipal solid waste landfill or recycled, through decontamination at 40 CFR 761.79, for
         metals recovery. While there is no regulatory requirement to test the potting material for PCBs
         prior to disposal, TSCA requires owners or operators with PCBs to dispose of them properly.
         Not all fluorescent light ballasts contain PCBs. All ballasts manufactured between July 1978
         and July 1998 are required to bear a "No PCB'' label indicating that they do not contain PCBs.
         Ballasts manufactured prior to July 1978 have a better than 50% chance of containing PCBs at
         50 ppm or greater in their potting material. Finally, state and/or local governments may have
         additional, more stringent, disposal requirements for PCB small capacitors or fluorescent light
         ballasts containing PCBs and some municipal solid waste landfills may not accept PCBs no
         matter what their form. EPA has been aware for many years that fluorescent light ballasts can
         contain PCB small capacitors. Under existing rules, intact and non-leaking PCB small capac-
         itors may be disposed of as municipal solid waste (unless the disposer is a manufacturer of
         PCB capacitors or PCB equipment) (see Sec. 761.60(b)(2)(ii)). Allegations have been made
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          145


          that disposal practices at municipal solid waste landfills can cause PCB small capacitors to
          rupture, creating a risk of ground water contamination. EPA asked for comment on this issue,
          and, in the event that additional disposal controls were needed, proposed to limit to 25 per year
          the number of fluorescent light ballasts containing PCB small capacitors that could be dis-
          posed of as municipal solid waste. EPA received no data confirming that the risk existed. EPA
          has not finalized this limitation. However, the EPA advises disposers of fluorescent light bal-
          lasts that contain a PCB small capacitor should be aware they could be subject to CERCLA
          liability if the municipal solid waste landfill becomes a Superfund site.
      9.4.8.4. Retrofilled Transformers. Recent testing at some bases has shown that some retrofilled
      transformers have PCB concentrations greater than 50 ppm and are no longer considered
      "Non-PCB items". This comes from slow leaching of PCB from old fluid trapped in internal com-
      ponents. Each base that retrofilled transformers should establish a continuing sampling effort for
      any retrofilled PCB transformers to verify the transformers remain below 50 ppm. Where ele-
      vated PCBs levels are found, take action to lower the concentration by executing provisions of
      your retrofill contract, if possible. Otherwise you should identify the most cost effective means to
      lower the concentration. If this situation occurs, document the required project in ACES-PM. If
      equipment is found to contain PCBs, institute an inspection and annual log maintenance program.

9.5. Lead-Based Paint.
   9.5.1. Lead Exposure. Lead-based paint is the most serious source of children's exposure to lead.
   Surveys in 1989 and 1990 by Housing Urban Development (HUD) found 75 percent of the homes
   constructed prior to 1980 contained lead-based paint. Sources of lead exposure vary, but most indi-
   viduals have been exposed to differing amounts of lead or lead-containing materials. Sources of lead
   include (Table 9.4.):

Table 9.4. Sources of Lead.
            Drinking water from the leaching of lead from components of household
            plumbing and from public and private water distribution systems
            Lead-based paint used in housing, child care centers, playground equipment,
            youth centers, medical waiting rooms, etc
            Lead in soil

   9.5.2. Lead Surveys. In 1995, ACC and completed a survey of all family housing units, all Com-
   mand child development centers, youth centers, playground equipment in base housing, and medical
   waiting areas to determine the location and extent of lead-based paint. The final reports were pro-
   vided to each installation's environmental flight. The report included hard copy reports and an elec-
   tronic database of survey analytical results. This resource should be used by the base lead-based paint
   officer to manage and track lead-contaminated materials. The primary area of emphasis for
   lead-based paint management is the family housing area and potential exposure of children.
   9.5.3. LBP Final Disclosure Rule. The EPA and Department of Housing and Urban Development
   (HUD) published regulations requiring disclosure of known lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint
   hazards by person selling or leasing housing constructed prior to the phase out of residential
   lead-based paint use in 1978. The regulations, 40 CFR 745 (EPA) and 24 CFR 35 (HUD), required

      this disclosure by 6 Sep 96 for all personnel being newly assigned to pre-1978 build MFH and by 6
      Feb 97 for all personnel already assigned to pre-1978 build MFH. HQ ACC/CE letter 6 Sep 96 to
      ACC Wings/CV, subject: "Policy and Guidance on Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Final Disclosure Rule,"
      provided the notification to all ACC bases with disclosure guidance. For further information installa-
      tions may wish to obtain EPA's Final Disclosure Rule pamphlet Protect Your Family from Lead in
      Your Home, EPA747-K-001, May 95. A pamphlet is available from the National Lead Information
      Center at 1-800-424-LEAD and bulk copies are available from the Government Printing Office, (202)
      512-1800 (stock no. 055-000-00507-9). The pamphlet is also available on the internet at http://
      www.epa.gov/opptintr/lead/leadpdfe.pdf and http://www.nsc.org/ehc/nlic/disclose.htm.
      9.5.4. Responsibilities:
         9.5.4.1. The wing Environmental Protection Committee (EPC) directs the development of a
         base-specific plan to manage lead hazards. A wing lead-based paint-working group is created to
         monitor lead issues. See HQ ACC/CV letter, ACC LBP Policy and Implementation Guidance,
         dated 16 December 1993. This policy letter describes in detail the assignment of responsibilities
         and should be referred to ensure compliance with ACC's lead-based paint management policies.
         Air Combat Command's primary focus for identifying and eliminating LBP hazards are its'
         high-priority facilities. "High-priority facilities are facilities or portions of facilities which are or
         may be frequented/used by children under age seven. These facilities are further prioritized as fol-
         lows (Table 9.5.):

Table 9.5. High-Priority Facilities.
           Child development centers, annexes, and playground equipment
           On-base, Air Force licensed family day care homes
           Youth centers, recreational facilities, and playgrounds
           Waiting areas in medical and dental treatment centers
           Air Force-maintained DoD schools
           Military family housing currently occupied by families with children under age seven
           All other military family housing" (HQ ACC/CV Ltr ACC Lead-Based Paint (LBP)
           Policy and Implementation Guidance, 16 Dec 1993)

         9.5.4.2. The wing lead-based paint program officer (LBPPO) appointed by the EPC should pos-
         sess the technical ability to lead, manage, and guide the base program successfully. The LBPPO
         should attend the one-week lead hazard training course approved by the EPA.
      9.5.5. Lead-Based Management:
         9.5.5.1. The lead-based paint management plan must be developed to identify, evaluate, manage
         and abate LBP hazards. The plan should address a strategy for identifying, evaluating, control-
         ling, and eliminating existing LBP hazards, protecting facility occupants, especially children, and
         workers from LBP hazards and ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations
         and laws.
         9.5.5.2. As a matter of policy, the Command emphasis is on protecting personnel and managing
         lead-based paint in place wherever possible. Abatement of lead-based paint will be performed as
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          147


     part of facility renovation and upgrade programs when it is cost-effective. The plan should also
     provide guidance to wing personnel on local procedures, conditions and policies unique to the
     installation. High priority facilities should be listed and action plans indicated for each to protect
     personnel and reduce exposure potential.
     9.5.5.3. The Lead-based Paint Management Plan should be reviewed and updated annually. The
     LBPPO through the LBP Working Group of the EPC will oversee the development of the LBP
     Management Plan. The EPC approves the final LBP Management Plan.
     9.5.5.4. Inventories of non-high priority facilities are required only prior to maintenance, repair,
     modification, and renovation activities, or when personnel exposure concerns arise. Self-help
     projects must be reviewed carefully to determine if lead-based paint will be in the way of the
     self-help work. Personnel should not be permitted to sand or chip paint that is suspect lead-based
     paint.
     9.5.5.5. Contracts involving lead-based paint removal must include requirements for the contrac-
     tor to be licensed to perform lead-based paint abatement in the state the work is performed. The
     specifications for the contract should detail requirements for work in accordance with HUD guide-
     lines and Air Force policy.
  9.5.6. Funding for lead-based paint abatement work utilizing environmental compliance program
  (ECP) dollars is similar to the asbestos program. ECP dollars may only be used for lead-based paint
  abatement work if it is a hazard to the health of personnel and it is not associated with any other
  planned or current maintenance, repair, construction, or renovation work. ECP funds may not be used
  for work performed in family housing or medical facilities.
  9.5.7. Estimating Cost to Remove Lead-Based Paint:
     9.5.7.1. To develop cost estimates and to program projects involving lead-based paint the
     lead-based paint project officer may follow the guidance provided from HQ ACC/CEV, 10 Jun 94,
     subject: Lead Based Paint (LBP) Cost Estimating Guidance and increase the numbers for infla-
     tion. Programming costs were derived by applying historical Air Force and HUD costs to typical
     Air Force family housing, childcare, and medical facilities
  9.5.8. Additional Considerations:
     9.5.8.1. The lead-based paint identification survey in 1995 concluded that damaged LBP on exte-
     rior surfaces appears to be contributing to lead in soil levels. Installations may consider planting
     grass, shrubs or some other ground cover in the areas affected, generally close to the building.
     Planting vegetation in the area decreases amounts of exposed dirt and reduces the chances the soil
     will be disturbed.
     9.5.8.2. Some states now allow a building grinding process to demolish and dispose of buildings
     containing lead-based paint materials. Contact the state Compliance Office to coordinate this type
     of work.
     9.5.8.3. Mini blinds with lead-based paint should be managed in place in the same way that the
     base manages lead-based paint throughout the installation. This includes incorporating mini
     blinds that contain lead-based paint (LBP) into the Base LBP Management plan. "High-priority
     facilities" defined as facilities frequently used by children under the age of seven should be
     addressed first. Mini-blinds with lead-based paint should be replaced on an attrition basis.
148                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         9.5.8.4. LBP is generally a very small percentage of construction debris, and sampling results
         generally are negative. There is no policy that states LBP contaminated construction debris is
         exempt from testing for disposal based on past history. ACC has had two instances where simple
         wooden structures contained enough lead for the debris to be disposed of as lead contaminated. To
         avoid delaying the demolition contractor, during the planning stage, take composite samples of all
         materials in the building.

9.6. Dioxins.
      9.6.1. Dioxin at ACC Bases. Dioxin (2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)) is highly toxic
      and may be a constituent of concern at ACC bases. There are 75 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin
      (PCDD) congeners and 135 polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners. The term "dioxin"
      refers to a group of chemical compounds that share certain similar chemical structures and
      mode-of-action biological characteristics. A total of 30 of these dioxin-like compounds exist and are
      members of three closely related families: the chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs), chlorinated
      dibenzofurans (CDFs) and certain PCBs. The most well studied of these is TCDD. CDDs and CDFs
      are not created intentionally, but are produced in nature and by a number of human activities. Com-
      bustion, chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper, certain types of chemical manufacturing and process-
      ing, and other industrial processes all create small quantities of dioxins. PCBs, while no longer
      manufactured in the United States, are among the family of chlorinated dioxin-like compounds.
         9.6.1.1. PCDD/Fs are listed by EPA as a Class B2 carcinogen, compounds for which there is suf-
         ficient evidence to show carcinogenicity in animals and inadequate evidence to show carcinoge-
         nicity in humans." (Griffith, James G. and Pitts, David M., Controlling Dioxin Emissions,
         Pollution Engineering, Nov 1995, p. 50.) The EPA, "estimates that the amount of dioxin found in
         the tissues of the general human population (which is known as the 'body burden') closely
         approaches (within a factor of 10) the levels at which adverse effects might be expected to occur,
         based on studies of animals and highly exposed human populations. Dietary intake of dioxin also
         appears to be declining. Dioxin levels in the environment have declined significantly since the
         1970s following EPA regulatory controls and industry actions" (EPA Information Sheet 1, 25 May
         02 update).
      9.6.2. Where to look for Dioxin at ACC installations. Uncontrolled combustion such as burning of
      household waste is expected become the largest quantified source of dioxin emissions to the environ-
      ment. The dioxin compound is created by incomplete combustion, chemical manufacturing, pulp and
      paper mills, herbicide manufacturing, and other processes. Likely areas of concern at ACC installa-
      tions include: sanitary sewage, TCDD residue (which was used in Agent Orange), and incinerators
      (especially the incineration of domestic garbage). Horstmann et al, in studies published in 1992 and
      1993, have theorized that most if not all of the TCDD/F present in domestic wastewater originate from
      the household laundry. Little data currently exists regarding the typical levels of TCDD/F in domestic
      wastewater. A survey of sewage sludge was conducted by EPA in 1988 and found all sewage sludges
      to have one or more of the TCDD/F congeners (Labat-Anderson Inc., Sampling and Analysis Report
      for Chlorinated Dibenz Dioxins in Wastewater and Sediments, Castle AFB, 22 Feb 1995, Contract
      Number: F2560-90-D-0003, D.O. M803, p. 20.). On 15 Dec 2001, EPA published a final decision not
      to regulate dioxin in sewage sludge that is incinerated or placed in sludge landfills or containment
      ponds. EPA is working on a final schedule for a separate decision for dioxin in sewage sludge that is
      land applied.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         149


   9.6.3. ACC Action. Actions required by ACC base environmental managers are primarily passive,
   but should include at minimum the following:
      9.6.3.1. Watch for any incineration or burning processes. The combustion of plastics, which con-
      tain chlorine compounds, should be prohibited at ACC bases.
      9.6.3.2. Sample wastewater sludge for dioxins prior to disposal. Ensure wastewater discharges
      meet NPDES 40 CFR 122 specifications to any receiving stream.
      9.6.3.3. HW containing dioxins are EPA Hazardous Waste No. F020, F021, F022, F023, F026
      F027 and F028. Ensure all waste of this type is sent to permitted hazardous waste facility that can
      accept dioxins for treatment and disposal.
      9.6.3.4. Comply with land disposal restrictions in 40 CFR 268.41 so that an extract of the waste
      has less than one part per billion of all hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins prior to land disposal. Incin-
      eration is almost always the treatment of preference for wastes containing dioxins.
      9.6.3.5. Comply with air emission pollution standards (New Source Performance Standards at 40
      CFR Subpart E should provide basic requirements).

9.7. Radon.
   9.7.1. Radon at ACC Bases. Radon is radioactive gas, element number 86 on the periodic chart of
   elements. It is not visible or distinguishable by smell or taste. Radon comes from the breakdown,
   (radioactive decay) of radium, a natural element found in soil. As radium, (element number 88) it pro-
   duces radon gas, which in turn decays into many other radioactive elements. Each time this multi-step
   decay process takes place, radioactive alpha particles are emitted. It is these alpha emitters that are
   responsible for the damage to personal health. In its February 1998 report, the National Academy of
   Sciences (NAS) found that radon is responsible for between 15,000 and 22,000 lung cancer deaths in
   the United States each year. Radon is not regulated under TSCA, but under the Indoor Radon Abate-
   ment Act of 1988 (IRAA). In this Act Congress directed EPA to address the growing concern over
   exposure to indoor radon. "Among other requirements, the law directed the Agency to study radon
   levels, evaluate mitigation methods, establish proficiency programs, assist states with program devel-
   opment, develop training centers, and provide public information. EPA has developed and imple-
   mented programs to address each of the key provisions of this statute" ("EPA's Strategy to Reduce
   Risk of Radon, Steve Page, ASTM Publication Code No. 28-015094-17, 1994, p. 134.). There is no
   regulatory mandated program requiring specific actions by EPA. There are however, several EPA rec-
   ommendations, which the Air Force has adopted as policy. On 1 Oct 98 President Clinton signed a
   Radon Action Week memorandum in which he encouraged environmental community to continue
   public awareness efforts and remind all Americans about the importance of testing for radon.
   9.7.2. Radon Surveys. In Oct 1987, the Air Force directed a comprehensive survey of all buildings
   where Air Force people live. The program was called "RAMP" for Radon Assessment and Mitigation
   Program. The program consisted of an initial screening phase, detailed assessment and post mitiga-
   tion. The RAMP program divided Air Force facilities into three categories. They were: Priority 1 or
   High priority facilities - family housing, child development centers, schools, dormitories, hospitals,
   confinement facilities, and visiting officer/enlisted quarters; Priority 2 - administrative areas with
   24-hour operations, and Priority 3 - all other facilities occupied more than 4 hours per day. The Occu-
   pational and Environmental Health Laboratory, Brooks AFB, accomplished the program execution for
   priority 1 facilities. ACC bases that ultimately required some post survey and/or mitigation efforts
150                                    ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      were Cannon, Ellsworth, Lajes, Langley, Minot, Nellis, Offutt, and Whiteman (This list of bases does
      not include those bases that have been closed or realigned to other Commands).
      9.7.3. Testing for Radon. Should base environmental personnel believe there might be an area of
      concern they may wish to conduct a short-term test. A short-term test consist of placing a collection
      unit in the lowest lived-in point of the facility for two days to 90 days, depending on the device.
      "Charcoal canisters," "alpha track," "electricion chamber," "continuous monitors," and "charcoal liq-
      uid scintillation" detectors are most commonly used for short-term testing. If the results are greater
      than 4 pCi/L a follow-up long-term test should be performed. The higher the initial short-term test
      result, the more certain another short-term or long-term follow-up test is needed. For example, about
      10 pCi/L or higher means a second short-term test is needed immediately.
      9.7.4. Safe Radon Levels. The average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi/L, and
      about 0.4 pCi/L of radon is normally found in the outside air (EPA's "A Citizen's Guide to Radon
      (Second Edition) May 1992, p. 7). If results are 4 pCi/L or higher than a follow-up long-term test
      should be conducted as described in paragraph 9.3.7. above. Since there are no known safe levels of
      radon, there can always be some risk. But the risk can be and should be reduced by lowering the radon
      level in Air Force dwellings. A variety of methods are used to reduce radon and in many cases simply
      sealing cracks in floors and walls will help reduce radon below the Action Level. In other cases, sim-
      ple systems using pipes and fans may be used to reduce radon, but it is not ACC policy to install these
      active-type systems until all other passive-type alternatives have been attempted. The Air Force
      action levels and required actions are indicated below (Table 9.6.):

Table 9.6. Action Levels and Required Actions.
                             Action Level (pCi/L)                 ACC Policy
                             (Long term results)
                        <4                             No further action
                        >= 4 but <= 20                 Mitigate within 1 year
                        >20 but <=200                  Mitigate within 3 months
                        > 200                          Mitigate ASAP

      9.7.5. Radon in Construction. All new facilities should be designed and constructed using tech-
      niques that reduce the potential health hazard from radon exposure to occupants. Radon mitigation is
      required if a new or existing facility is assessed to have yearly average radon levels in excess of 4 pCi/
      L. When constructing new facilities at bases with yearly average radon levels above 4 pCi/L, radon
      prevention techniques should be employed (HQ TAC/DEEE Ltr., Subj: "Engineering Technical Let-
      ter 88-9: Radon Reduction in New Facility Construction," 22 Nov 1988). When conducting renova-
      tion of units in known high Radon areas it is important to test the area for radon before beginning the
      renovation. During the design phase of the project would be an ideal time to identify Radon concerns
      so they can be addressed as part of the renovation project.
      9.7.6. Radon in Housing. Family housing, dormitories or other living quarters where past radon
      results have exceeded the Action Levels shown in Table 9.6. should be checked periodically to ensure
      post-mitigation efforts are working. The checks could be done as part of the occupant changeover
      process.

              EMERGENCY PLANNING COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW ACT

10.1. General Requirements. In the mid 1980s, two accidental releases of methyl-isocyanate (C2H3NO)
caused thousands of deaths and injuries in Bhopal, India, and several hundred injuries in Institute, West
Virginia. Alarmed by these incidents, Congress enacted the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986, 42 U.S.C. 11001 et seq.,. EPCRA is also known as title III of the
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA Title III) that amended CERCLA. EPCRA
establishes requirements for emergency planning on the state, regional, and local level, as well as new
reporting requirements. The intent is to ensure that local communities are adequately informed on a facil-
ity's chemical inventory, and are prepared to deal with emergency situations involving those chemicals.
Originally exempt from EPCRA requirements, federal facilities became subject to regulation when Presi-
dent Clinton signed Executive Order 12856 in 1993. As a result, all DoD installations are subject to the
requirements of EPCRA, and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990.
   10.1.1. Responsibilities:
       10.1.1.1. Overall program responsibility at ACC is the Environmental Programs Division. Wing
       and group level responsibilities are assigned by the wing commander as appropriate to each mis-
       sion. Generally the civil engineering environmental flight retains overall program responsibility
       with other organizations responsible for certain sections of EPCRA. Recommended assignments
       of responsibility are as outlined in Table 10.1.

      10.1.2. Policy Guidance:
         10.1.2.1. Applicable Air Force guidance for the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to
         Know Act (EPCRA) is found in AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning
         and Operations. The revision outlines EPCRA roles and responsibilities.
         10.1.2.2. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 establishes State
         Emergency Response Committees, Emergency Planning Districts, and Local Emergency Planning
         Committees. The objective is to ensure that states and communities are prepared for, and ready to
         respond to, environmental emergencies which may pose a serious threat to the health and well
         being of the local population.
      10.1.3. Waivers To Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
      requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
      provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
      sound engineering and/or environmental practices that maintain environmental compliance.
      10.1.4. Applicability. The requirements of this chapter apply to all CONUS installations including
      tenants. Overseas locations are governed by the Final Governing Standard for that country.

10.2. Permits. There are no permits associated with SARA Title III or EPCRA; however there are report-
ing, notification, and coordinating responsibilities as outlined in this chapter.

10.3. Sub-Titles. EPCRA is broken into subtitles A, B, and C. Subtitles A and B are of primary concern
to ACC operations. The subtitles are further defined as follows:
      10.3.1. Subtitle A, Emergency Planning and Notification:
         10.3.1.1. Subtitle A of EPCRA corresponds to 40 CFR 355.
         10.3.1.2. Section 301 establishes the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC). The
         SERC is tasked with establishing emergency planning districts and a Local Emergency Planning
         Committee (LEPC) in each district. The number of planning districts varies widely from state to
         state. Installation CEX equivalent offices should represent all Air Force installations on the
         LEPC.
         10.3.1.3. Section 302 identifies the substances and facilities covered by Subtitle A. An installa-
         tion is subject to the requirements of Subtitle A if any chemical on the Extremely Hazardous Sub-
         stance (EHS) list (40 CFR 355, appendices A and B) is present at the facility in quantities equal to
         or greater than the published threshold planning quantity (TPQ) on any one day. Almost every
         ACC base will be subject to these requirements. For example; the TPQ for chlorine is 100 pounds.
         Any base with a sewage treatment works, drinking water plant, or even a swimming pool could
         easily stock more than 100 pounds of chlorine. Section 302 requires that the SERC be notified of
         the presence of any EHS above the TPQ. Only initial notification is required, and every base
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          153


     should already be in compliance with this requirement. The SERC should be notified immediately
     if any new EHSs are brought onto the installation in quantities that meet or exceed the TPQ.
     10.3.1.4. Section 303 requires that the LEPC must prepare an "emergency response plan" for the
     community. As a local facility, the base is expected to take part in the preparation of this plan, and
     the annual review. A facility specific emergency response plan is not required under EPCRA.
     Section 303 also requires that the base notify the LEPC of the presence of any EHS above the TPQ
     on any one day. As in section 302, only initial notification is required. The LEPC should be noti-
     fied immediately if any new EHSs are brought onto the installation in quantities that meet or
     exceed the TPQ.
     10.3.1.5. Section 304 establishes the circumstances in which releases of EHS or CERCLA haz-
     ardous substances must be reported. Any release of an EHS (40 CFR 355) or a CERCLA hazard-
     ous substance (40 CFR 302) in excess of the reportable quantity (RQ) must be reported to the
     National Response Center (NRC), the SERC, and the LEPC. Additional information on reporting
     can be found in Chapter 11, Spill Management.
  10.3.2. Subtitle B, Reporting Requirements:
     10.3.2.1. Subtitle B corresponds to 40 CFR 370 - 372.
     10.3.2.2. Section 311 defines the requirements for making available material safety data sheets
     (MSDSs) or related information. The base must supply copies of MSDSs for any EHS on the
     installation that meets or exceeds 500 pounds or the TPQ (whichever is smaller) or any OSHA
     hazardous chemical (29 CFR 1910.1200(c)) that meets or exceeds 10,000 pounds, to the LEPC
     and the SERC. A list of chemicals and quantities may be substituted for MSDSs at the discretion
     of the SERC and the LEPC. MSDSs must be available on request to the public as well. Consid-
     ering the broad definition of hazardous chemical under OSHA, almost any chemical could be
     reportable under section 311. Chemicals that could be on hand in large enough quantities include
     fuels, hydraulic fluids and oils, compressed gases, AFFF, deicing chemicals, munitions
     (HAZCOM chemicals in excess of 10,000 pounds), chlorine, ammonia, and hydrazine,
     ("Extremely Hazardous Substances" in excess of the TPQ).
     10.3.2.3. Section 312 establishes chemical inventory reporting requirements, using either the Tier
     I or Tier II inventory report forms. It is the base's option on which form to use initially. The base
     must supply Tier I or II reports for any EHS on the installation that meets or exceeds 500 pounds
     or the TPQ (whichever is smaller) or any OSHA hazardous chemical (29 CFR 1910.1200(c)) that
     meets or exceeds 10,000 pounds. The reports are due March first of each year. If the base chooses
     to use the simpler Tier I form for the annual report, the SERC or the LEPC may request a Tier II
     form for any chemical subject to these requirements. The public may also request this information
     from the SERC or LEPC.
     10.3.2.4. Section 313 establishes the requirement for Toxic Chemical Release Forms, also known
     as "Form R". This requirement is somewhat different then the rest of EPCRA in that it aims to
     gather information on how much of a chemical is "manufactured, processed, or otherwise used" at
     a facility. In other words the information is a measure of quantities used or produced by a facility,
     and is not used for emergency planning and response. "Form R" has its own unique list of hazard-
     ous chemicals that can be found in 40 CFR 372; its applicability is governed by several exemp-
     tions that attempt to reduce reporting of ancillary activities and focus on primary mission.
     However, like most regulations, EPCRA was written with industry in mind and it may be difficult
154                                ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      to apply section 313 requirements to the typical Air Force Base. ACC has made reporting as sim-
      ple as possible, while still adhering to the spirit of E.O. 12856.
      10.3.2.5. A Form R report is required for any listed chemical manufactured or processed in excess
      of 25,000 pounds, or otherwise used in excess of 10,000 pounds. The report is due on July 1, and
      covers all of the chemicals used throughout the year, not the quantity on hand on any given day.
      This requirement also covers all mixtures one percent in concentration and above for toxic chem-
      icals, and 0.1 percent in concentration and above for carcinogens as defined by the OSHA
      HAZCOM standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). Listed chemicals below these concentrations are
      exempt from reporting. This is known as the de minimis concentration exemption. It is important
      to know that there are several other exemptions to section 313 requirements. The following are of
      particular importance to ACC bases:
         10.3.2.5.1. Chemicals that are used or contained in materials that are used as a structural com-
         ponent of your facility (40 CFR 372.38(c)(1)). HQ USAF has interpreted this to include facil-
         ity maintenance and repair activities including painting.
         10.3.2.5.2. Chemicals that are contained in products that are used for routine janitorial or
         facility grounds maintenance (40 CFR 372.38(c)(2)). In addition to routine cleaning products,
         this includes pesticides and fertilizers used in grounds maintenance on golf courses and all
         other areas around base.
         10.3.2.5.3. Chemicals used by employees or other persons at the facility (40 CFR
         372.38(c)(3)). This includes drugs and other personal items, but most importantly, it includes
         chlorine used to treat drinking water on the installation. This exemption only covers drinking
         water used by personnel on base, and does not include water used in other processes (i.e., air-
         craft washing). It is almost impossible to differentiate between chlorine used for drinking, and
         water used in other processes. It also does not cover chlorine used for wastewater treatment.
         10.3.2.5.4. Chemicals that are used for or contained in products that are used for the mainte-
         nance of motor vehicles operated by the facility (40 CFR 372.38(c)(4)). Covers chemicals
         used in the maintenance and operation of cars, trucks, fork-lifts, tow motors, etc. This
         includes chemicals and products used on ACC vehicles.
      10.3.2.6. According to EPA, aircraft are considered motor vehicles and technically exempt from
      reporting. This exemption was intended to cover delivery vehicles, corporate jets, and the like;
      however, since flying aircraft is the primary mission of the Air Force, HQ USAF has determined
      that exempting all aircraft maintenance operations is not in keeping with the spirit of E.O. 12856.
      Although aircraft may technically be exempt, we will report related chemicals. One exception is
      the materials necessary to accomplish day-to-day flying operations, such as adding oils and lubri-
      cants. In addition, fuels associated with motor vehicle activities (aircraft included) are exempt.
      Even without the exemption, Form R reporting will likely be limited to only a few chemicals. The
      most likely candidates for reporting for an ACC installation include: MEK from painting and
      depainting operations and chlorine used in wastewater treatment. Ethylene glycol (a common air-
      craft deicer) is on the list, but all aircraft and airfield deicing activities are exempt. Every base is
      responsible for determining their unique responsibilities under this requirement. Additional infor-
      mation on the Air Force interpretation of Form R requirements can be found the "Air Force Guid-
      ance for Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Reporting", dated 10 April 1995.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                             155


10.4. Dinitrogen Tetraoxide (N2O4 ) and Liquid Fluorine (F2).
   10.4.1. The Chemical Abstract Number for Dinitrogen tetraoxide, nitrogen peoxide, or Dinitrogen
   tetroxide is 10544-72-6.
   10.4.2. Emergencies. DoD has authority to ship dinitrogen tetraoxide and liquid fluorine in quantities
   and by modes that are normally prohibited. In the event of a release or emergency situation involving
   these substances, the nearest DoD facility is responsible for initiating emergency response and acting
   as the federal on-scene coordinator (FOSC). Bases that are potential FOSCs have been supplied with
   a substance specific emergency response plan written by the SA-ALC/SFSP at Kelly AFB. All
   affected bases should be familiar with their responsibilities. If an installation is not certain if they are
   affected contact HQ ACC/CEVQM for guidance. Current plans are exercised every two years, and
   plan updates are distributed accordingly. Additional information is available from the SA-ALC plan-
   ning office at DSN 945-6937 or commercial (210) 925-6937.

10.5. Range Operations. TRI tracking and reporting requirements apply to range training activities as
of CY 2001. To support this requirement, ACC/DOR tasked ranges to track all munitions used during
training activities. The information will be provided to the supporting environmental flight by March of
each year for release calculation and possible reporting. Actual TRI releases to the environment will be
calculated using the DoD developed TRI-DDS (Data Delivery System) software. Information and the
most current version of the program can be found at http://www.dod-tridds.org.

                                                 Chapter 11

                                  SPILL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

11.1. General Requirements.
      11.1.1. Responsibilities:
         11.1.1.1. To ensure timely reporting of environmental releases, the Base Civil Engineer is dele-
         gated as the reporting official for notify appropriate federal, state, and local regulatory agencies.
         Notifications must be made immediately upon discovery of a reportable environmental release.
         This authority may be further delegated to the Environmental Flight Chief (CEV) or designated
         CEV program manager.
         11.1.1.2. Installations conduct large spill response exercises to ensure all essential parts of spill
         management are in place and functioning. Spill response exercises can be held in conjunction
         with wing level disaster response exercises.
         11.1.1.3. For installations located in foreign countries, notification is required for all reportable
         releases. Notify the appropriate host nation authorities when a release migrates off the installation
         or causes or has the potential to cause, environmental, health, or safety impact off the installation.
         Procedures found in the corresponding Final Governing Standards must be followed.
      11.1.2. Policy. While this policy outlines general procedures for compliance with the Oil Pollution
      Act, the specific application of the policy must be coordinated with applicable local and state regula-
      tory requirements. Follow the strictest regulatory requirement that applies to your installation. This
      policy is guidance and is provided to assists installation Spill program managers in the accomplish-
      ment of their duties.
      11.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
      requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
      provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
      sound engineering and/or environmental practices, which maintain environmental compliance.
      11.1.4. Applicability. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations,
      ANG, and AFRES units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing com-
      mander. Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordina-
      tion with the host installation.

11.2. Air Force Reportable Releases.
      11.2.1. Reportable to HQ ACC/CEVQ. If any of the following conditions are met, the material
      release should be reported to HQ ACC/CEVQ using the ACC Environmental Hazardous Material
      Release Report:
         11.2.1.1. Was the release greater than 25 gallons of POL?
         11.2.1.2. Was the release greater than the RQ for the material?
         11.2.1.3. Did the release contaminate any body of water?
         11.2.1.4. Was the release a reportable sewage spill?
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                            157


      11.2.1.5. Was anyone injured as a result of the release?
      11.2.1.6. Did the release acquire any media attention?
      11.2.1.7. Did the release satisfy particular aspects of the protocol/ media in violation that would
      initiate the reporting of this material release to any off-base agencies?
      11.2.1.8. If questions remain concerning whether a certain release at your installations meets one
      of the above criteria or if it is believed that even though the release does not meet one of the above
      criteria, it should still be reported please contact HQ ACC/ CEVQ. Common sense should govern
      this process. When in doubt either ask HQ ACC/CEVQ or submit a Release Report. AFI
      10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations, outlines the Air Force
      release notification and reporting requirements in addition to those in this manual. Operational
      reporting required by AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting, is followed by the installation to
      report operational issues to the headquarters.
   11.2.2. Significant Releases. Regardless of the specific situation or quantities, initiate notification if
   the release is or has the potential to be "significant". These reports will be forwarded on to ACC and
   Air Force leadership. If you have any question about whether a release meets this definition contact
   HQ ACC/CEVQ. Significant is defined as:
      11.2.2.1. Readily perceived environmental impacts.
      11.2.2.2. Injury, loss of life, or adverse impact on human health or safety.
      11.2.2.3. Public involvement.
      11.2.2.4. Major financial impact.
      11.2.2.5. Unfavorable publicity or political/host nation involvement.
      11.2.2.6. Involving an aircraft incident with an environmental impact.

11.3. Air Force Reporting.
   11.3.1. Reporting to HQ ACC/CEVQ. Notify HQ ACC/CEV of all Air Force reportable releases
   (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)7139) via the world wide web at https://www.cevp.com/spill/. If unable to
   access the world wide web a report may be filed by e-mail or FAX. A sample spill report form format,
   ACC Environmental Hazardous Material Release Report, is located at Attachment 2. This form con-
   tains most of the information included in federal spill reporting requirements. Fax (DSN 574-9369) or
   mail spill reports to HQ ACC/CEVQ, attention Mr. Gil Burnet; 129 Andrews Street, Suite 102, Lan-
   gley AFB, VA 23665-2769 or e-mail gilbert.burnet@langley.af.mil. Faxed or e-mailed reports must
   be posted to the substance release ACC World Wide Web reporting system as soon as possible.
      11.3.1.1. Execute all release notification and reporting requirements according to applicable fed-
      eral, state, and local regulations. Notification and reporting requirements must be fully complied
      with for reportable environmental releases that occur on Air Force property (including Govern-
      ment-Owned, Contractor-Operated), or that an Air Force Activity has caused. Reporting to HQ
      ACC/CEVQ should occur within 24 hours or the next duty day of knowledge of a reportable mate-
      rial release unless the release is significant, in which case the ACC Environmental Hazardous
      Material Release Report should be submitted immediately. This notification does not supersede
      other agencies that must also be contacted in accordance with the policy/procedure for the partic-
158                                    ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         ular protocol/media that is being violated. This notification is an additional report specifically for
         HQ ACC.
      11.3.2. Reporting of Significant Releases. Notification of release events is accomplished by using
      the Air Force Operational Reporting System (see AFPD 10-2, Readiness, and AFMAN 10-206, Oper-
      ational Reporting). Follow the specific instructions in AFMAN 10-206, chapter 3. The wing com-
      mand post is the primary responsible agency for sending OPREPs. Base CEV flight personnel must
      follow local wing instructions on preparing OPREP messages and coordinate all release reports
      through wing command sections. OPREPs will be forwarded to HQ USAF as required by AFMAN
      10-206.
      11.3.3. Submit environmental release notification within the Air Force using the Air Force Opera-
      tional Reporting System, Operational Status Reports (OPREP-3) according to AFMAN 10-206.
      Notify appropriate MAJCOM offices and HQ USAF/ILEV/ILEO of any release that meets one or
      more of the following criteria:
         11.3.3.1. Results in injury or loss of life.
         11.3.3.2. Results in loss of aircraft or facility.
         11.3.3.3. Causes interruption of flying operations.
         11.3.3.4. Causes environmental contamination extending beyond installation boundaries.
         11.3.3.5. Creates financial impact exceeding $50,000.
         11.3.3.6. May result in litigation, publicity, or media coverage.
         11.3.3.7. Other reasons, as specified by local commander.
      11.3.4. Include in the OPREP-3 report the following information:
         11.3.4.1. Date and approximate time of release.
         11.3.4.2. Location of release.
         11.3.4.3. Chemical description or common name of released hazardous material(s).
         11.3.4.4. Approximate amount(s) released.
         11.3.4.5. Primary, situation-specific reason for notifying MAJCOM or HQUSAF/ILEV/ILEO,
         (e.g., contaminant entered public drinking water supply, or media coverage anticipated).
      11.3.5. A separate OPREP-3 report is required to transmit the information listed above. Take action
      to eliminate duplicate reporting by consolidating the above information in a single OPREP-3 report to
      meet all notification requirements, including environmental, readiness, and others. Unless a release
      meets one or more of the criteria listed above, notification of HQ USAF/ILEV is not required when
      response and clean up are completed in a routine manner.
      11.3.6. Provide follow-up reports on incidents meeting any of the criteria listed above to the MAJ-
      COM by updates to the ACC spill reporting web page or when necessary by telephone, e-mail, or
      OPREP-3 as required by the situation. MAJCOMs submit follow-up information to HQ USAF/ILEV/
      ILEO on an exception basis to fulfill HQ USAF information requirements.
      11.3.7. Range Spill Reporting. Ranges must also report any spill to the corresponding regulators
      and ACC. The range's civil engineering unit or the supporting installation's environmental office can
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         159


  accomplish this. The deciding factor for the reporting responsibility should depend on the existing
  capability of the range and its geographic location in respect to the supporting installation. The
  responsibility arrangements should be coordinated by the installation environmental flight and incor-
  porated into the Host Tenant Support Agreement.
  11.3.8. HQ ACC/CEVQ Material Release Reporting Requirements and Procedures. By going
  to the location specified at https://www.cevp.com/spill/. Enter the prompting to submit a report. At
  the next page, verify again that your material release is reportable using the standards shown on the
  screen and those listed in 11.2.1. If one of these conditions is met, submit a report. Once inside the
  ACC Environmental Hazardous Material Release Report, fill out the form noting certain fields must
  be populated to complete the report.
     11.3.8.1. Every ACC Environmental Hazardous Material Release Report must contain the report-
     ers name, installation, organization, duty phone, and an e-mail address where the reporting indi-
     vidual can be reached while the Material Release report is open. In addition, all yes or no
     questions and the release classification questions must be answered.
     11.3.8.2. To the best knowledge and ability of the reporting official the following information
     should be known, but may not always be exact if conditions do not permit: date of release, time of
     release, material released, quantity of release and the units that this was measured in, the quantity
     recovered in the same units of measurement as was represented previously in the quantity of
     release, equipment/facility involved; to include the aircraft type with tail number or equipment
     model number if pertaining, and the location of the release. If any of this information is not exact,
     for any reason, this should be noted in the "Brief Narrative" field. Such items that might be
     included in this box for instance are approximate time of releases or if the material released was
     unknown or a combined material.
     11.3.8.3. Questions on the ACC Environmental Hazardous Release Report for the root cause of
     the release from the EIIB, the estimated cost of clean-up, estimated man hours, injuries with their
     description, and the remedial actions taken will probably not be known completely at the time of
     the original submittal of the ACC Environmental Hazardous Release Report. However, these
     fields should be answered as best as possible, and in the subsequent "Remarks" field there should
     be an annotation for each one of these inexact answers, if there are any, describing why they are
     not completely accurate and what course of action is currently being taken to gather or complete
     the information.
     11.3.8.4. Due to the protocol/media that is in violation, certain fields or questions may not be
     included in the ACC Environmental Hazardous Material Release Report. These extra questions
     are included below under the particular protocol/media sections of this chapter. Also answer these
     questions in the "Brief Narrative" field in the ACC Environmental Hazardous Material Release
     Report.
     11.3.8.5. When all fields have been answered completely, select the button to "Commit to Data-
     base". When more information is forthcoming, the additional information must be added to the
     ACC Environmental Hazardous Material Release Report in order to keep it up to day and accu-
     rate.

11.4. Federal Material Release Reporting Requirements. Any spill may be covered by the reporting
requirements of several environmental acts. For example, a spill of 500 gallons of JP-8 to waters of the
U.S. could potentially be regulated by: RCRA (because the now unusable fuel could be considered an
ignitable hazardous waste); CERCLA and EPCRA (because the reportable quantity for RCRA ignitable
wastes is 100 pounds); and the CWA (because the release is to navigable waters of the U.S.). It is imper-
ative that all federal reporting requirements be met. Regardless of the quantity, any release of a hazardous
substance or POL into the environment should be reported to the National Response Center (NRC) at
800-424-8802 if there is any potential for adverse environmental impact or unfavorable publicity. Addi-
tional information on reporting to the NRC follows, however, the key advice to understand is, when in
doubt, report.
      11.4.1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Hazardous Waste Spills:
         11.4.1.1. In 1976, Congress enacted RCRA to provide a comprehensive, "cradle to grave" system
         for handling hazardous waste. RCRA's implementing regulations establish a very complex set of
         rules covering generation, storage, labeling, treatment, disposal, and reporting requirements for
         hazardous waste. See Chapter 2 of this manual for a complete discussion.
         11.4.1.2. RCRA applies only to certain materials and certain types of spills will "trigger" the
         reporting requirements. The threshold question to ask when considering whether to report a spill
         is whether the material is covered by RCRA. This law applies only to "solid wastes" as defined at
         40 CFR 261.2, unless specifically excluded by 40 CFR 261.4. If you determine that the material
         is a solid waste which is not specifically excluded from RCRA coverage, it must also fit under the
         definition of "hazardous waste" under 40 CFR 261, Subpart C (for wastes which exhibit hazardous
         characteristics) or 40 CFR 261, Subpart D (for materials which are specifically listed as hazard-
         ous).
         11.4.1.3. Finally, base personnel must analyze whether a "release" has occurred. Under RCRA, a
         spill that does not escape from the facility in which it occurs is not a "release". The "facility"
         means a building or other containment area. While the definition of a "facility" varies with the
         law, it is clear that regulators interpret facility in the "civilian" sense (that is, as a building or other
         containment area).
         11.4.1.4. Once it has been determined that a "release" or "spill" of hazardous waste has occurred,
         notification must be made. The base Environmental Flight Chief or Emergency Coordinator must
         respond immediately. He or she must at once determine the type and characteristics of the spilled
         substance, as well as the source, quantity, and area of contamination, while simultaneously assess-
         ing the threat posed by the spilled material to human health or the environment.
         11.4.1.5. Notification of the spill must be given immediately to the EPA's "On-Site Coordinator"
         for that region (as designated by the area Contingency Plan under 42 USC 1510) or to the National
         Response Center if the spill could pose a threat to human health or the environment or otherwise
         required by regulation.
         11.4.1.6. In addition, installations with a RCRA storage permit must immediately notify appropri-
         ate local authorities if the base Emergency Coordinator believes that evacuation of the local area
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         161


     is advisable (40 CFR 264.56(d)). The local authorities may include police and fire as well as the
     local community emergency response coordinating official.
     11.4.1.7. To the extent possible, the report must contain the following information for RCRA
     Spill Reports:
        11.4.1.7.1. The time and type of incident (that is, a spill, fire, etc.).
        11.4.1.7.2. The possible hazards to human health.
     11.4.1.8. A written follow-up report must be made to the EPA Regional Administrator within 15
     days after the incident.
     11.4.1.9. RCRA hazardous wastes may also be CERCLA, CWA, or EPCRA hazardous
     sub-stances or EPCRA extremely hazardous substances, thereby requiring multiple notification
     responsibilities. One call placed to the National Response Center will be sufficient notice of the
     incident to the NRC. However, there may be additional requirements for reporting to other agen-
     cies, such as state or local agencies and councils. It is critical that the base be aware that RCRA
     reporting requirements of 24 hours may be superseded by the more stringent requirement for
     immediate notification in the event of a spill of CERCLA hazardous substances in reportable
     quantities.
  11.4.2. Underground Storage Tank Spills:
     11.4.2.1. The requirement for reporting releases or spills from USTs is different in a number of
     ways from other RCRA requirements. First, this provision of RCRA (found at 40 CFR 280) gov-
     erns releases or spills of CERCLA hazardous substances as well as petroleum.
     11.4.2.2. Under the UST reporting provisions, owners and operators of UST systems must report
     within 24 hours the discovery of any releases or spills of regulated substances (40 CFR 280.50).
     In addition, the base must report within 24 hours any spill or overfill which results in the spill or
     release in excess of 25 gallons (or some other amount which causes a sheen on nearby surface
     water) of petroleum or an amount in excess of the CERCLA reportable quantity for CERCLA haz-
     ardous substance spills or overfills from USTs (40 CFR 280.53).
     11.4.2.3. State Specific UST Spill Reporting:
        11.4.2.3.1. California. The California UST advisory committee advocates risked-based deci-
        sion making and supports the use of bioremediation as a viable treatment alternative for petro-
        leum contamination from leaking USTs. This is a significant departure form the previous "dig
        until clean" philosophy. The committee generally supports the findings of the Lawrence Liv-
        ermore National Laboratory study release in the fall of 1995. A copy of this report was sent to
        each base in Feb 96. ACC suggests the bases use this report as a negotiation starting point
        with their state and federal regulators for UST and petroleum cleanup projects.
        11.4.2.3.2. North Carolina. The North Carolina General Assembly ratified UST Senate Bill
        (SB) 1317 on 21 Jun 96. This legislation requires all UST related contamination incidents to
        be ranked according to the Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources
        (DEHNR) Site Priority Ranking System. SB 1317 temporarily suspends the requirement to
        cleanup a release from a UST ranked as a low priority site. DEHNR was required by this leg-
        islation to develop draft risk based remediation rules by the end of 1996 and have the rules in
        final form by October 1997. Initial containment of the release, corrective actions to mitigate
162                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


            immediate hazards, initial site characterization, free product recovery and reporting are still
            required. The majority of the priority sites at NC bases are ranked as low priority sites.
      11.4.3. CWA:
         11.4.3.1. Section 311(b) of CWA requires any person in charge of a facility to immediately notify
         the NCR's toll-free telephone system at 800-424-8802. This notification should follow as soon as
         the person in charge has knowledge of any discharge of a reportable quantity in a 24 hour period
         of an oil release or any of the 300 (listed at 40 CFR 117) hazardous substances (except a release in
         compliance with a permit under the CWA) released into or upon the navigable waters of the US.
         The term "reportable quantity" is a volumetric or weight measure of the amount of the hazardous
         substance which, if exceeded in a 24-hour period, requires reporting to the NRC. For example, a
         spill of less than one pound of silver into the navigable waters of the US would not require a report
         under CWA (but may require a report under some other federal or state law), but spills of silver
         totaling more than one pound over a 24 hour period would require such notice.
         11.4.3.2. For those facilities which pre-treat industrial waste prior to discharge into a local pub-
         licly owned treatment works (POTW), an upset event which causes the unintentional spill of
         excess contaminants into the POTW must be reported to the POTW authority within 24 hours of
         becoming aware of the upset. A discharge into the POTW of a substance that would be a RCRA
         hazardous waste must be reported within 24 hours if the facility discharges at least 15 kilograms
         of hazardous waste in the month involved. Any discharge of an acute hazardous waste (as speci-
         fied in 40 CFR 261.31 and 40 CFR 261.32) must also be reported to the POTW authority within
         24 hours regardless of the normal hazardous waste load handled by the facility.
         11.4.3.3. Information required orally will include everything on the ACC Environmental Hazard-
         ous Material Release Report with the following question also in addition, if available:
            11.4.3.3.1. Duration of spill.
            11.4.3.3.2. Whether a continuing threat to human health exist.
            11.4.3.3.3. Weather conditions.
            11.4.3.3.4. Carrier involved if during transportation.
            11.4.3.3.5. All additional names of agencies that have been notified.
      11.4.4. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA):
         11.4.4.1. Any person in charge of any facility, who has knowledge of any spill (except a "feder-
         ally permitted" release) of a hazardous substance (note that the term "hazardous substance" is
         broader than and includes the term "hazardous waste") in excess of the "reportable quantities"
         established under CERCLA Section 102, must "immediately" notify the National Response Cen-
         ter of the spill. CERCLA implementing regulations for spill reporting are found at 40 CFR 302.
         Information required orally will include everything on the ACC Environmental Hazardous Mate-
         rial Release Report with the following question also in addition, if available
            11.4.4.1.1. Name of the responsible party.
            11.4.4.1.2. Whether substance spilled is "extremely hazardous".
            11.4.4.1.3. Medium involved (whether spill was into ground, air or water).
            11.4.4.1.4. Duration of spill.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           163


        11.4.4.1.5. Whether continuing danger to public exists.
        11.4.4.1.6. Weather conditions.
        11.4.4.1.7. Identification of carrier if during transportation.
        11.4.4.1.8. Identification of all other agencies notified that were not included on the Material
        Release Report.
  11.4.5. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA):
     11.4.5.1. As a supplement to CERCLA, Congress enacted the Superfund Amendments and Reau-
     thorization Act of 1986 (SARA); Title III is referred to as EPCRA, and is codified at 42 U.S.C.
     11001 et seq. In addition to emergency planning requirements, EPCRA has established emer-
     gency spill notification requirements to local communities for hazardous and extremely hazardous
     substances. Regulations promulgated under EPCRA are found at 40 CFR 355.
     11.4.5.2. EPCRA requires the immediate reporting by the facility owner or operator to the Local
     Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) (specifically, the Community Emergency Coordinator)
     and State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) of spills outside the facility boundaries of
     any CERCLA hazardous substance above the CERCLA reportable quantity and any of four hun-
     dred "extremely hazardous substances" in an amount exceeding one pound. Also reportable are
     RCRA hazardous wastes.
     11.4.5.3. Information required orally will include everything on the ACC Environmental Hazard-
     ous Material Release Report with the following question also in addition, if available:
        11.4.5.3.1. Information identifying the reporter's company.
        11.4.5.3.2. Duration of spill.
        11.4.5.3.3. Medium (i.e., air, soil, water) into which spilled.
        11.4.5.3.4. Known acute or chronic health risks, including medical advice if known.
        11.4.5.3.5. Whether the substance is one that is listed at 42 USC 11002.
     11.4.5.4. A more detailed written follow-up report is required as soon after the spill as is practica-
     ble.
  11.4.6. Hazardous Material Transportation Act (HMTA):
     11.4.6.1. The HMTA amended the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to include a provision
     regarding the unintentional spill of hazardous materials in transportation. HMTA requires notifi-
     cation at the earliest practicable moment of a spill of hazardous materials during the course of
     transportation in which a spill directly results in the hospitalization or death of a person, evacua-
     tion of the general public, or closure of a major transportation artery or facility lasting one or more
     hours. Thus, like RCRA, there is no requisite "reportable quantity" of material that will trigger the
     reporting requirement. Rather the occurrence of the above-specified events is sufficient to trigger
     the requirement.
     11.4.6.2. The required notification is given to the NRC. The notice should include the following
     information in addition to what the ACC Environmental Hazardous Material Release Report
     requires:
        11.4.6.2.1. Name and address of the carrier.
164                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


             11.4.6.2.2. Whether a danger to human health exists.
         11.4.6.3. A written follow-up report is required on special Department of Transportation forms
         within 30 days of the date of discovery of the spill. These provisions preempt state or local law or
         regulation (that is, those which are not substantially the same as the federal equivalent) regarding
         written notification and reporting of the unintentional spill in transportation of hazardous materi-
         als.
      11.4.7. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA):
         11.4.7.1. TSCA covers substances that may pose a substantial risk of injury to health or the envi-
         ronment. Also specifically included as TSCA covered materials are PCB's and asbestos.
         11.4.7.2. TSCA requires immediate notice by telephone call to the Regional EPA Administrator
         of an emergency incident of environmental contamination. This incident is one which seriously
         threatens humans with cancer, birth defects, mutation, death, or serious incapacitation, or which
         seriously threatens non-human organisms with large scale or ecologically significant population
         destruction.
         11.4.7.3. The items that should be included in this oral report in addition to the items already in
         the ACC Environmental Hazardous Release Report:
             11.4.7.3.1. A statement that the report is made in accordance with TSCA 8(a).
             11.4.7.3.2. A summary of the adverse effects being reported.
             11.4.7.3.3. The source of the information being reported.
             11.4.7.3.4. A written follow-up report is required.
         11.4.7.4. Additionally, TSCA requires a party responsible for certain spills of PCBs in concentra-
         tions of 50 parts per million or greater to provide notice to the EPA region in the shortest possible
         time after discovery. Spill reports of the following special interest items are reviewed for Com-
         mand environmental managers. Although these procedures indicate items may or may not be
         reportable under the conditions indicated, it is always appropriate to report spills when conditions
         dictate to do so. For example, regardless of the procedures if a release harms the environment or
         personnel it is probably reportable.

11.5. Spill Prevention and Planning Requirements.
      11.5.1. All ACC installations store large amounts of petroleum products to meet their mission of pro-
      viding global air power. Adequate spill planning and prevention are, therefore, essential parts of each
      ACC installation's compliance and risk management programs. Further, adequately meeting spill
      planning and prevention regulations typically requires substantial funds and major upgrade projects.
      11.5.2. The purpose of this portion of the manual is to outline regulatory requirements for spill pre-
      vention, control, and countermeasures (SPCC) planning and implementation. ACC personnel in fuels
      (and other oil) management and environmental planning must ensure that SPCC requirements are met.
      This information along with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance and resources
      can become foundations to more efficient command and installation-level planning.
      11.5.3. Regulations which impose SPCC planning requirements. Federal regulations [40 Code of
      Federal Regulations (CFR) 112] implemented under the authority of the federal CWA (CWA) (33
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        165


  United States Code §§ 1321 and 1361) specify spill prevention and planning requirements for facili-
  ties at risk of discharging oil to navigable waterways.
     11.5.3.1. Requirements to implement SPCC planning. Onshore and offshore facilities that could
     reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities to navigable waters of the United
     States and that exceed the following threshold quantities of oil storage must meet SPCC planning
     requirements (See 40 CFR 112.1):
         11.5.3.1.1. Cumulative buried underground storage capacity of the facility is 42,000 gal or
         more.
         11.5.3.1.2. Cumulative storage capacity that is not buried is 1,320 gal or more.
         11.5.3.1.3. A single container exceeds 660 gal.
  11.5.4. Defining Trigger Thresholds. EPA guidance states: "If your facility meets at least one of
  the three oil storage capacity criteria stated above, then all tanks, aboveground and underground, are
  subject to SPCC requirements. For example, if you store over 42,000 gal of oil product in under-
  ground storage tanks (USTs), then, even if you have only one 500-gal aboveground storage tank
  (AST), all tanks are subject to SPCC requirements" (EPA's Compliance Assistance Guide, SPCC
  Requirements and Pollution Prevention Practices for Vehicle Service Facilities,"
  https://www.epa.gov/oilspill/spccguid.htm.
     11.5.4.1. The following key terms in 40 CFR 112.1 are defined as follows:
         11.5.4.1.1. Facility. All buildings, equipment, structures, and other stationary items which
         are located on a single site or on contiguous or adjacent sites and which are owned or operated
         by the same person (or by any person which controls, is controlled by, or under common con-
         trol with, such person), specifically includes motor vehicles, rolling stock, and aircraft.
         11.5.4.1.2. Harmful Quantities. Violate applicable water quality standards; or cause a film
         or sheen upon or discoloration of the surface of the water or adjoining shorelines or cause a
         sludge or emulsion to be deposited beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shore-
         lines. [61 FR 7421, Feb. 28, 1996].
         11.5.4.1.3. Navigable waters of the United States means: Waters of the United States as
         defined in 40 CFR 122.2. This is a legal term of art that has been interpreted by a number of
         court decisions. Consult with JAV if you have questions over EPA's jurisdiction over a partic-
         ular water or the environmental status of a water.
         11.5.4.1.4. Onshore facility means any facility of any kind located in, on, or under any land
         within the United States, other than submerged lands, which is not a transportation-related
         facility.
         11.5.4.1.5. Offshore facility means any facility of any kind located in, on, or under any of the
         navigable waters of the United States, which is not a transportation-related facility.
         11.5.4.1.6. "Oil means oil of any kind or in any form, including, but not limited to petroleum,
         fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil.
  11.5.5. Installation must address the installation as a whole in SPCC planning. Trying to define
  "facility" in SPCC Plans to not exceed trigger thresholds should not be done. Discussions with EPA
  Regional SPCC Coordinators make it clear that EPA Regions do not allow installations to break up
166                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      their activities by deeming each activity to be a separate facility, thus circumventing SPCC require-
      ments because the threshold capacities are not met.
      11.5.6. Exclusions from SPCC Plan requirements. Facilities that could not reasonably be expected to
      discharge oil into or on navigable waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines are not subject to
      SPCC Plan requirements. In making this determination, EPA only considers geographical and loca-
      tion aspects of the facility. EPA does not consider any man-made feature, such as dikes or equipment,
      used to prevent oil from discharging to navigable waters of the United States. SPCC regulations also
      exclude activities subject to DOT authority and control from SPCC Plan requirements. However,
      DOT requires oil spill prevention and response plans when packaging exceeds certain threshold quan-
      tities (49 CFR 30). This requirement may be met through a separate plan or within the facility's SPCC
      Plan.
      11.5.7. Components of an SPCC Plan requires that SPCC Plans follow the sequence outlined in 40
      CFR 112.7 and include the following:
         11.5.7.1. A discussion of spill history.
         11.5.7.2. Prediction of spill direction and flow.
         11.5.7.3. A discussion of containment of diversionary structures.
         11.5.7.4. A discussion of spill prevention procedures such as dike draining and testing proce-
         dures.
      11.5.8. SPCC Plans must clearly address:
         11.5.8.1. Operating procedures that prevent oil spills.
         11.5.8.2. Control measures installed to prevent a spill from reaching navigable waters.
         11.5.8.3. Countermeasures to contain, clean up, and mitigate the effects of an oil spill that reaches
         navigable waters.
      11.5.9. SPCC Plans must be prepared under the direction of a competent licensed engineer who is
      knowledgeable of the spill plan regulations and the facility. Technical amendments must be certified
      by a licensed professional engineer, typically in the state where the SPCC plan is prepared.
      11.5.10. A good plan is only a start that must be fully implemented (40 CFR 112.3). Effective imple-
      mentation means that every containment or diversionary structure referenced in the SPCC Plan must
      be available and maintained. Every procedure, inspection, record, etc., described in the plan must
      actually be used and documented. The plan must be kept current with operations by amending the
      plan when conditions change.
      11.5.11. If it is impracticable to install structures and equipment to prevent discharge of oil the owner
      and operator must:
         11.5.11.1. Clearly demonstrate why it is impracticable.
         11.5.11.2. Develop a strong spill contingency plan following the provisions for state, local, and
         regional oil removal contingency plans outlined in 40 CFR 109.
         11.5.11.3. Prepare a written commitment of manpower, equipment, and materials required to
         expeditiously control and remove any harmful quantity of oil that is discharged.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          167


  11.5.12. An example of impractical discharge prevention is oil stored in transformers at an electrical
  substation where the fire (safety) hazard may be greater than the spill hazard.
  11.5.13. Records required to demonstrate the plan is effectively implemented depends on the specific
  facility and operational requirements of the facility's SPCC Plan. 40 CFR 112.7 requires records for
  the following:
     11.5.13.1. 112.7(e)(2)(iii)(D), dike drainage events.
     11.5.13.2. 112.7(e)(2)(vi), inspection of bulk storage tanks and ancillary piping appurtenances).
     11.5.13.3. 112.7(e)(2)(viii)(E), overfill liquid level indicator testing.
     11.5.13.4. 112.7(e)(3)(iv), inspection of piping.
     11.5.13.5. 112.7(e)(5)(iii)©, visual inspection of tanks for periodic maintenance.
  11.5.14. 40 CFR 112.7(e)(8) requires that records be kept a least 3 years.
  11.5.15. Training required to effectively implement the SPCC plan depends on the facility in question
  and specific training requirements identified in the facility's SPCC Plan. 40 CFR 112.7(e)(10)
  requires the following:
     11.5.15.1. 112.7(e)(10)(i), Owners/operators are responsible for properly training their personnel.
     11.5.15.2. 112.7(e)(10)(iii), Owners/operators should schedule and conduct spill prevention brief-
     ings at intervals frequent enough to ensure adequate understanding of the SPCC Plan for the facil-
     ity. The briefing should cover known spills/failures, malfunctioning components, and recently
     developed precautionary measures.
     11.5.15.3. Training sessions and briefings should be documented.
  11.5.16. The interpretation of the meaning of "bulk storage" varies among EPA Regions. Most
  Regions agree that bulk storage is storage of oil of any capacity at "non-[oil]production facilities."
  EPA Region II describes bulk storage as any container that contains oil, even 1-quart cans. However,
  the secondary containment for 1-quart cans would only require absorbent materials. Region X inter-
  prets bulk storage as any containers greater than or equal to 55-gal drums. In general, it is a good idea
  to specifically address oil storage containers greater than 55 gal and to address (at least generically)
  containers less than 55 gal. Small, mobile containers should be stored in a storage area, and this stor-
  age area should be addressed in the SPCC Plan and provided with appropriate secondary containment.
  EPA also interprets equipment containing oil such as hydraulic tanks and transformers as "bulk stor-
  age."
  11.5.17. 40 CFR 112.7(e)(2)(ii) states: "All bulk storage tank installations should be constructed so
  that a secondary means of containment is provided for the entire contents of the largest single tank
  plus sufficient freeboard to allow for precipitation. Diked areas should be sufficiently impervious to
  contain spilled oil. Dikes, containment curbs, and pits are commonly employed for this purpose, but
  they may not always be appropriate. An alternative system could consist of a complete drainage
  trench enclosure arranged so that a spill could terminate and be safely confined in a plant catchment
  basin or holding pond." In addition, double-walled tanks may be used if a warning system is operable
  to indicate leakage in the primary tanks.
  11.5.18. Gas Stations. The same requirements apply to gas stations as to other facilities with poten-
  tial to discharge oil. If the gas station is located on a facility subject to SPCC Plan requirements, the
168                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      gas station must be included in the plan and elements of the plan must be implemented at the gas sta-
      tion.
         11.5.18.1. Local gas stations must meet the same requirements as base gas stations. However,
         local gas stations may not trigger the SPCC thresholds (e.g., store less than 42,000 gal of fuel
         underground), or they may not be in compliance with the SPCC regulation. EPA developed a
         compliance assistance guide for vehicle service facilities (http://www.epa.gov/oilspill/pdfs/
         spccbluebroch2002.pdf that explains the specifics of SPCC Plan compliance for facilities such as
         vehicle repair shops and gas stations.
      11.5.19. Requirements for refuel and tanker truck parking. Movable storage units need secondary
      containment when not in motion (e.g., overnight storage). Possible spills from the trucks must be con-
      tained. The amount of containment must be at least equal to the largest compartment of the trucks
      likely to park there (plus additional volume as a safety factor). The most efficient form of contain-
      ment may be curbing around the parking area. Containment must be in accordance with 40 CFR 112.3
      and 112.7.
      11.5.20. Requirements for mobile tanks such as fuel bowsers. Some form of secondary containment
      must be present. A double-walled bowser is acceptable if the capacity of the outer section can hold
      over 100% of the inner section and a warning system operates to indicate leakage in the first tank.
      11.5.21. Facilities that do not exceed thresholds. Although not required, SPCC planning may be pru-
      dent to manage risks from spilled oil and for pollution prevention and storm water management.
      Facilities with effective plans are likely to generate fewer wastes from spill management, and effec-
      tive oil storage management is an important component of effective storm water management.
      11.5.22. Additional resources to understand SPCC requirements. EPA regulations on the oil program
      are available at the following regulatory websites:
         11.5.22.1. http://www.epa.gov/oilspill/index.htm.
         11.5.22.2. http://www.epa.gov/epacfr40/chapt-I.info/.
         11.5.22.3. http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/index.html.
         11.5.22.4. EPA's Oil Spill Hotline (1-800-424-9346), for information, and EPA Headquarters
         (HQ) (1-703-603-8760), for interpretations, are also useful numbers. HQ EPA often defers to the
         EPA Regional SPCC Coordinators for regulatory interpretations. Contact numbers for each
         region are available from EPA's oil spill website. The ACC Technical Contact has additional
         names and numbers for these individuals.
      11.5.23. The following EPA Regional websites are also available:
         11.5.23.1. EPA Region III. http://www.epa.gov/oilspill/docs/r30601.pdf.

11.6. Special Interest Items. Spill reports of the following special interest items are reviewed for Com-
mand environmental managers. Although these procedures indicate items may or may not be reportable
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           169


under the conditions indicated, it is always appropriate to report spills when conditions dictate to do so.
For example, regardless of the procedures if a release harms the environment or personnel or has been
reported in the media it is probably reportable.
   11.6.1. Halon:
       11.6.1.1. Air Force policy on installed Halon fire protection systems is as follows: "Automatic
       discharge mechanisms will be disabled and systems will be placed on manual activation in order
       to reduce accidental HALON loss to the atmosphere. Presently there are no approved ACC waiv-
       ers to allow unmanned or mission critical facilities to remain in automatic mode. All requests to
       deviate from this policy must be approved by AF/CEVV."(HQ ACC/CEX message 151600Z Sep
       95, AF Policy on Installed HALON Fire Protection Systems).
       11.6.1.2. Discharge of a Halon fire protection system is not a reportable release as it is not a haz-
       ardous substance per 40 CFR 302. ACC installations shall document any release incident and
       maintain the records for future reference.
   11.6.2. Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF). Federal Register Vol. 60, No. 112, pages
   30926-30962, dated 12 June 1995, changed the reportable quantities of many hazardous substances.
   Included in this change were substances in AFFF. Glycol ethers (which is the broad class of hazard-
   ous substances which includes AFFF, Monobutyl Ether Diethylene Glycol, are no longer reportable.
   This latter change is significant since AFFF spills account for the second largest number of spill
   reports the Air Force makes. Additionally, no EIIBs will be necessary for AFFF releases.
   11.6.3. Fuel Jettisoning:
       11.6.3.1. In flight fuel dumping is a normal emergency action taken by military aircraft crews
       faced with in flight emergencies. For certain types of aircraft emergencies fuel jettisoning is
       required for the safety of flight and recovery of the aircraft. Aircraft fuel jettisoning is not a
       reportable spill and is not regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration, Environmental Pro-
       tection Agency, or the Department of Transportation (PRO-ACT Technical Inquiry 1739 -
       In-flight Fuel Dumping, 12 Oct 1993).
       11.6.3.2. Since conversion to JP-8, a much less volatile fuel than JP-4, there are concerns about
       the potential for unevaporated fuel to reach the ground after jettisoning. Armstrong Laboratory,
       AL/EQS, Tyndall AFB FL is working dispersion modeling analysis to determine safe levels and
       quantities for jettisoning JP-8 fuel.
       11.6.3.3. The results of their study has found for strategic aircraft (B-52s, KC-135, etc.) the mini-
       mum altitude that will allow all jettisoned fuel to evaporate before reaching the ground for JP-8 is
       approximately 18,000 feet as compared with 5,000 feet with JP-4. While the numbers are still
       somewhat uncertain for JP-8, predictions indicate that these minimum altitudes will more than
       double. This may impact recommended operational altitudes for non-emergency fuel jettisoning.
       Additionally, while JP-4 evaporates almost immediately upon impact with the ground (depending
       on ambient temperatures), JP-8 can take more than 20 hours to evaporate. This significantly
       increases the potential environmental hazard associated with fuel jettisoned from military aircraft
       (AL/EQS, Tyndall AFB FL 10 Jan 96 memorandum, New Fuel Jettisoning Simulation Model).
       11.6.3.4. Human Systems Wing (formerly Armstrong Laboratory) has developed a computer soft-
       ware simulation model called "Fuel Jettisoning Simulation," or FJSIM which incorporates the
       results of over three years of study to assess the impact of fuel jettisoned from military aircraft.
170                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         The PC and Windows-based FJSIM model estimates the location, aerial extent, and magnitude of
         ground contamination due to the jettisoning of fuel, as well as the time-dependent reduction of
         ground level concentration due to evaporation. The model includes a verified multi-component
         fuel evaporation model, meteorological effects (temperature, relative humidity and wind profiles,
         cloud cover information, and atmospheric stability), realistic fuel jettisoning information includ-
         ing fuel port locations and dimensions for each aircraft type, fuel flow rates, airspeeds, and aircraft
         wake affects. This software will provide a capability to quantify ground-level contamination due
         to fuel jettisoning by military aircraft. The software is available from HQ AFCESA.
      11.6.4. Jet Engine Fuel Dumping on Aircraft Parking Ramp at Engine Shutdown:
         11.6.4.1. Many aircraft engines dump a small quantity (six to eight ounces) of fuel when fuel lines
         are automatically purged at engine shutdown. 40 CFR § 87.11 states, "This paragraph is directed
         at the elimination of intentional discharge to the atmosphere of fuel drained from fuel nozzle man-
         ifolds after engines are shut down and does not apply to normal fuel seepage from shaft seals,
         joints, and fittings". This regulation was written specifically for commercial aircraft and does not
         apply to military aircraft (The preamble to 40 CFR 87.3 states this rule, "include only those
         engines manufactured for U.S. civil aviation sales" and this does not include sales for "engines
         sold for military or foreign services which are not subject to the U.S. emissions standards." HQ
         ACC/JAV review suggests some to all military engines are exempt from this rule).
         11.6.4.2. Logistics centers within the Air Force are working to eliminate the fuel dump feature for
         aircraft by capping the drain outlet port and other appropriate modifications. Some engines have
         been modified and still others are being reviewed for ways to eliminate the fuel dumping.
         11.6.4.3. The following guidance is provided to ACC environmental managers. Every effort must
         be made to ensure fuel is not dumped into open storm or sanitary drains or waters of the United
         States. The prevention of fuel venting into the atmosphere is an engine modification problem and
         does not require extraordinary actions by base personnel to catch these small quantities of fuel.
         Follow weapon system specific Technical Orders or if not mentioned in weapon T.O. then follow
         00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding which has been changed
         to read, "Personnel shall not be subjected to increased risk to catch servicing fluids. If a spill
         occurs, it shall be controlled in accordance with local regulations once the aircraft and surrounding
         area are all made safe." The quantity of fuel dumped may be estimated by environmental manag-
         ers for air emission inventory or other purposes where local regulations or procedures require such
         information (SA-ALC/LR Ltr to HQ AFRES/LG dated 5 Dec 1994, Fuel Dumping During Engine
         Shutdown.). The responsibility for design changes and modifications for aircraft turbine engines
         rest at the Air Force depots. Compliance with 40 CFR 87.11 will be achieved with the appropriate
         modifications that have been made by these depots.
      11.6.5. Hydrazine (H4N2):
         11.6.5.1. Hydrazine is colorless, oily, fuming liquid or white crystals with a flash point of 100 ×F.
         When heated to decomposition it emits highly toxic fumes of NOx and NH3. Hydrazine is used as
         the fuel source for the emergency power generator for the F-16 flight system. It is a confirmed
         carcinogen and a very dangerous fire hazard when exposed to heat, flame, or oxidizing agents. It
         is listed as an extremely hazardous substance under EPCRA (40 CFR 355), a hazardous substance
         under CERCLA (40 CFR 302.4) with a reportable quantity of 1 pound, and a listed (U133) waste
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          171


     under RCRA (40 CFR 261.33). Any release must be managed in accordance with all the require-
     ments of these acts.
     11.6.5.2. Neutralization of Hydrazine is typically done using common household liquid bleach
     (NaCLO).
  11.6.6. Chlorine and Chlorine Precursor Chemicals. Chlorine and chlorine precursor chemicals
  (Calcium Hypochlorite and Sodium Hypochlorite) are used primarily as disinfecting agents in swim-
  ming pools, water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants, and in households. Chlorine is a poi-
  son gas and extremely irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Chlorine and chlorine precursor
  chemicals are listed under EPCRA (40 CFR 355) as extremely hazardous substance and as hazardous
  substances under CERCLA (40CFR 302.4). Under CERCLA, Chlorine has a reportable quantity of
  10 pounds; Sodium Hypochlorite has a reportable quantity of 100 pounds; and Calcium Hypochlorite
  has a reportable quantity of 10 pounds. A release of these materials must be managed in accordance
  with all the requirements of these acts.
  11.6.7. Aircraft Incidents:
     11.6.7.1. Aircraft incidents are covered in AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. The
     MAJCOM commander is the investigating and convening authority. When formal boards investi-
     gate ANG/AFRES (Air Reserve Component - ARC) mishaps, the boards are convened by the
     gaining MAJCOM. The environmental flight of the host installation will be required to manage
     the environmental portion of the cleanup.
     11.6.7.2. ACC accepts financial responsibility for crash site cleanup for ACC aircraft incidents.
     The nearest Air Force installation provides the initial response and assesses cleanup requirements.
     After the initial response and assessment is complete, the ACC base owning the aircraft would
     choose to either take the lead in the final cleanup for the site, or provide funds for the nearest
     installation to continue cleanup activities, if the installation accepts the responsibility. A special
     account is set up in the host installation FM that funds all aspects of the cleanup effort.
     11.6.7.3. Funding the cleanup of aircraft in the possession of an ARC which crashes is the respon-
     sibility of the ARC. The term "possession" is used in this context as defined in AFI 21-103,
     Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting, "Possession is the actual acceptance,
     operational use (utilization), or designation of responsibility for an aircraft".
     11.6.7.4. Lessons learned for environmental flight chiefs is to treat all A/C crashes as having a
     high potential for environmental releases and to report such incidents immediately to federal and
     state emergency response authorities as a potential release. Update release notification checklists
     to include A/C crashes and include phone numbers for all state offices where your installation air-
     craft routinely fly. Keep your regulatory authority informed of spill release cleanup initiatives at
     the crash site and when appropriate request their advice on cleanup actions.
  11.6.8. Defense Energy Supply Center (DESC) Funding for Spills. Spills should be handled at the
  base as an emergency situation. This means the base should not wait for funding from DESC before
  committing funds to begin responding to a release. DESC will "reimburse" the base for funds used in
  spill response/cleanup as long as proper documentation is provided and the spill did not result from
  gross operator negligence. Immediately notify ACC CES/ESO detailing the intention to request
  DESC funding for the spill cleanup. Requests for funds must be timely to gain "reimbursement" from
  DESC.

                                                Chapter 12

                   ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TRACKING AND REPORTING

12.1. General Requirements.
      12.1.1. Responsibilities:
         12.1.1.1. The Environmental Flight Commanders or designated representatives are responsible
         for ensuring timely reporting and tracking of environmental compliance inspections, assessed
         environmental enforcement actions, and environmental compliance agreements entered into as a
         result of environmental enforcement actions. Base CEV or designated representative enters
         inspections, enforcement actions, and compliance agreements into the ACES-EM Inspection and
         Enforcement Actions Module when it is operationally fielded. Until ACES-EM implementation,
         base CEV or designated representatives must notify the ACC Environmental Quality Branch
         (ACC/CEVQ) at DSN 574-9412 or at DSN 574-9309 or e-mail HQ ACC/CEVQ within 24 hours
         of all regulatory inspections conducted, receipt of any enforcement action and maintain documen-
         tation pertaining to the violation or inspection.
      12.1.2. Policy Guidance:
         12.1.2.1. The purpose of the Open Enforcement Action (OEA) program is to supplement HQ
         USAF policy on environmental compliance inspections, enforcement actions, and compliance
         agreements reporting and tracking requirements. It provides the data required for the monthly
         Open Enforcement Action Management Actions Plans (OEA MAPs), the quarterly Regional
         Environmental Office Environmental Compliance Status Briefing (ECSB), and the semi-annual
         Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment (DUSD(I&E) report, to HQ
         USAF/ILEV. Each quarter HQ USAF/ILE sends an OEA Report message to MAJCOM Environ-
         mental Protection Committee Chairs, Civil Engineers and Judge Advocates. The program also
         provides a database to track and identify trends so resources may be targeted as needed. In addi-
         tion, it provides data for the quarterly OEA Quality Performance Measure (QPM) briefing to the
         ACC Leadership Board (ELB), Environmental Leadership Council (ELC), and the ACC Com-
         mander in support of the ACC Strategic Plan.
         12.1.2.2. USAF installations have made tremendous progress in reducing the number of open
         enforcement actions (OEAs) and preventing new ones. However, in reality, no matter how proac-
         tive a base's environmental compliance program is, enforcement actions and fines/penalties are
         possible. If a regulatory inspector looks hard enough he or she can find something to write up.
         12.1.2.3. The goal is to be OEA free. However, reality is from time to time ACC bases will
         receive enforcement actions. This guidance document is provided to assist base environmental
         managers in reporting and tracking regulatory inspections, violations, fines/penalties, or compli-
         ance agreements as the result of regulatory inspections.
      12.1.3. Waivers to Policy. This policy is applicable to all ACC installations. Should an installation
      have an extenuating circumstance necessitating a waiver for the reporting or tracking requirements of
      an enforcement action, a base must request a waiver from ACC/CEV. The request should provide sig-
      nificant cause and mission impact statements or documentation that makes completion of the required
      reporting in this chapter impracticable.
      12.1.4. Applicability:
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                      173


    12.1.4.1. Relevance. These guidelines apply to all ACC bases, ACC Geographically Separated
    Units (GSUs) and include collocated tenant units, except for Air National Guard (ANG), and Air
    Force Reserve (AFRES) units. ANG and AFRES units have similar reporting requirements to
    their respective headquarters. ACC tenant units located on other MAJCOM bases should use the
    reporting system used by the host base. The United States Air Force has established environmen-
    tal compliance and pollution prevention programs to ensure achievement of full compliance with
    laws and regulations of the United States, the states, and local communities in which their facili-
    ties are situated.
    12.1.4.2. Applicability in Foreign Countries. Overseas ACC Air Force activities must track
    and report compliance as required by AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program in Foreign Countries,
    and HQ USAF/ILEV Policy Guidance (RCS: HAF-CEV(Q&AR)9415, Report of Enforcement
    Actions). Host nation and Final Governing Standards also apply. The following paragraphs pro-
    vide policy and guidance to manage and report open enforcement actions outside the U.S. and its
    territories and apply at ACC locations overseas.
       12.1.4.2.1. Definitions:
           12.1.4.2.1.1. Host Nation Open Enforcement Actions (HNOEA). A written notice
           from a host nation governmental authority (HNGA) must indicate one or more violations
           of host nation environmental requirements. The cited condition must be validated by the
           MAJCOM environmental office reflecting noncompliance with DoD Final Governing
           Standards, obligations under applicable international agreements, or posing an imminent
           and substantial endangerment to human health or safety.
           12.1.4.2.1.2. Closed Enforcement Actions. A HNOEA closes when a memorandum is
           issued by HNGA stating they are satisfied with actions taken to resolve the cited viola-
           tion(s), rescinds the HNOEA, or does not respond within 60 days of written notification
           that the HNOEA is considered closed.
       12.1.4.2.2. Reporting and Tracking Procedures:
           12.1.4.2.2.1. Develop a MAJCOM HNOEA validation and closure process in coordina-
           tion with the installation environmental protection committee (EPC), and other necessary
           organizations.
           12.1.4.2.2.2. HQ USAFE/CEV submits a quarterly HNOEA/MAP report to HQ AFCEE/
           CCR-A by the 5th working day of each month. The following is a list of data requirements
           to include in quarterly reports to the REO with a copy to HQ USAF/ILEVQ:
               12.1.4.2.2.2.1. Provide the command, office symbol, name, and phone number of the
               action officer (AO) for the report submitted from the MAJCOM. Coordinate with your
               newly assigned regional environmental office (REO) to acquire the required format to
               submit the report by electronic means.
               12.1.4.2.2.2.2. List the installation, Action Officer (AO), phone and fax numbers, and
               the root cause of each HNOEA in the report.
               12.1.4.2.2.2.3. Provide a Management Action Plan (MAP) to close all open enforce-
               ment actions to include the installation, AO, phone number, reason for violation, Final
               Governing Standard or obligation under international agreement violated, date vali-
174                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


                     dated by MAJCOM, background description of the problem, and a list of required clo-
                     sure actions with the expected and actual completion dates.

12.2. Tracking and Reporting Procedures.
      12.2.1. Tracking Enforcement Actions. All enforcement actions (EAs) issued by federal, state, or
      local regulators are tracked. This includes wastewater pretreatment criteria violations and other local
      environmental violations provided the issuing agency has been delegated enforcement authority under
      a valid state enforcement law. All enforcement actions that are tracked by the issuing regulatory
      agency are also tracked by ACC/CE, USAF/ILE, and SAF/MIQ regardless of the nature. This
      includes warning letters, notices of violation or noncompliance, administrative orders, letters of defi-
      ciency, compliance orders, letters of violation.
         12.2.1.1. Deciding on the nature of correspondence from a regulatory agency (that is, whether the
         document represents an enforcement action) may require a subjective, yet impartial interpretation.
         This interpretation is especially important when responses may affect other bases or MAJCOMs in
         the same state or EPA region. To this end, forward to ACC/CEVQ a copy of all written correspon-
         dence received from a regulatory agency indicating noncompliance with one or more regulations
         or statutes. ACC/CEV will validate, through the Regional Environmental Offices, whether or not
         the alleged violations are being tracked as an enforcement action by the issuing regulator.
         12.2.1.2. Notify the ACC Environmental Quality Branch (ACC/CEVQ) by phone, DSN
         574-9412 or DSN 574-9309 or commercially (757) 764-9412/9309 or fax number DSN 574-9369,
         within 24 hours of the receipt of any environmental non-compliance (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)9432,
         Immediate Report of Enforcement Action). In addition, ACC bases must fax (DSN 574-9369) or
         e-mail electronic copies within five workdays and all correspondence in which the regulators con-
         siders the base out of compliance (including any fines assessed for Resource Conservation and
         Recovery Act (RCRA) and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) violations) to ACC/CEVQ, Attn:
         Enforcement Actions Program Manager, and to the applicable Air Force Center for Environmental
         Excellence (AFCEE) Regional Environmental Office (REO). Subsequent correspondence from
         the base or regulators pertaining to specific enforcement actions must also be forwarded to ACC/
         CEVQ and applicable REO. Correspondence related to Federal Facility Compliance Agreements
         (FFCAs), other compliance agreements, and Federal Facility Agreements (FFAs) must also be
         provided to ACC/CEVQ and the applicable REO. It is extremely important for ACC bases to
         make every effort to get compliance information to ACC/CEVQ and the applicable REO as
         quickly as possible so that the Air Force is not at an informational disadvantage when dealing with
         the regulators. The environmental compliance correspondence from the bases is used in the MAJ-
         COM and REO validation process and to provide semi-annual updates to USAF/ILE and SAF/
         MIQ.
         12.2.1.3. As a general rule, if the issuing regulatory agency is tracking a warning letter or other
         regulatory correspondence as an enforcement action, ACC and USAF will also track the infrac-
         tion. ACC via the applicable REO will coordinate with the issuing regulatory authority to deter-
         mine if the correspondence is being tracked as an enforcement action.

12.3. Specific Reporting Procedures.
      12.3.1. ACES-EM Inspection and Enforcement Module:
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        175


     12.3.1.1. Upon implementation, the Inspection and Enforcement Module of ACES-EM will auto-
     mate the tracking of environmental compliance inspections by regulatory agencies; EAs issued by
     those agencies and compliance agreements (CAs) between the base and regulators.
  12.3.2. Closure of Open Enforcement Actions. An OEA is considered resolved and considered
  closed if any of the following conditions are met:
     12.3.2.1. Revocation of the action by the imposing regulator.
     12.3.2.2. Closure of the action following written notice by the regulator that the action is closed.
     12.3.2.3. Receipt of a signed compliance agreement or order
     12.3.2.4. When an enforcement action is officially closed, the base will make an entry in the
     Inspection and Enforcement Module (once implemented) in the appropriate place.
  12.3.3. Enforcement Action Prevention:
     12.3.3.1. Bases should always try to prevent enforcement action. A strong ESOHCAMP program
     and a commitment to quickly fix an environmental finding are a good start. Regulatory agency
     enforcement actions should always be thoroughly reviewed for accuracy and validity. Sometimes
     regulatory agencies submit enforcement actions that are erroneous and should be challenged.
     Coordinate with ACC CEV/JAV early in the decision making process prior to responding to an
     enforcement action.
     12.3.3.2. Long-term cleanup, compliance monitoring, compliance agreement, consent order, and/
     or memoranda of agreement, should be pursued early in the process to bring the enforcement
     action to a quick closure.

             ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS OF RESOURCES AND TRAINING SYSTEM

13.1. General Requirements. The Environmental Status of Resources and Training System (ESORTS)
is a method of communicating with senior ACC and AF leaders the health of environmental management
programs. Based on SORTS, the combat readiness reporting system, ESORTS uses a 4-point scale to
characterize environmental management program health. The ESORTS rating is composed of two parts,
the criteria rating and the installation commander's rating. Similar to SORTS, the installation com-
mander's rating is reported as the overall rating for the installation. Criteria and pillars are rated to inform
the commander of the status of certain key areas of the environmental program. The installation com-
mander will make the final assessment of his/her environmental program health rating (Table 13.1.):

Table 13.1. ESORTS Ratings.
                                  ESORTS Rating              Description
                                       E1            No Problems
                                       E2            Minor Problems
                                       E3            Major Problems
                                       E4            Program Failure

      13.1.1. Responsibilities:
         13.1.1.1. The HQ ACC/CEVQ, Environmental Quality Branch:
             13.1.1.1.1. Provides overall Command guidance for ESORTS program policy and oversight.
             Serves as the principal representative and advocate of ACC, Federal, state, and local agencies,
             and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Environmental Compliance, and Pollu-
             tion Prevention.
             13.1.1.1.2. Validates installations ESORTS reports prior to presentation to leadership and
             management.
         13.1.1.2. The HQ ACC/CEVQP, Compliance Through Pollution Prevention Section:
             13.1.1.2.1. Works with other MAJCOMs and HQ USAF/ILEVQ to cross-feed and standard-
             ize environmental resources and training oversight systems for communicating with senior AF
             leaders.
             13.1.1.2.2. Manages the ESORTS reporting system, and record-keeping program.
             13.1.1.2.3. Ensures base compliance with this guidance through the submittal of periodic
             reporting and ECAMP audits.
         13.1.1.3. Installation Civil Engineering Environmental Flight:
             13.1.1.3.1. Basic installation program management includes assessment of key elements in
             the environmental program. These elements include Compliance, Pollution Prevention, Con-
             servation, and Restoration. Reports to HQ ACC/CEVQP are due by the 15th workday follow-
             ing the quarter.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         177


         13.1.1.3.2. The Environmental Compliance element includes criterion for assessment of open
         enforcement actions, environmental permits compliance, and ECAMP findings closure. Part
         of each of these criteria includes funds obligations to implement the various environmental
         compliance actions.
         13.1.1.3.3. The Pollution Prevention element includes criterion for assessment of the Hazard-
         ous Material Pharmacy program, Hazardous Waste Disposal Reduction program, and Solid
         Waste Disposal Reduction program. Part of each of these criteria includes funds obligations to
         implement the various Pollution Prevention actions.
         13.1.1.3.4. The Environmental Conservation element includes criterion for assessment of the
         management of the Environmental Impact Analysis Process program and currency of plans,
         surveys, and inventories. The Environmental Restoration element includes criterion for
         assessment of the management of the Environmental Restoration Program, compliance with
         Restoration Legal Agreements, Restoration Advisory Board (RAB) Meeting Frequency, and
         funds obligation for project execution.
  13.1.2. Policy Guidance:
     13.1.2.1. Applicable Air Force guidance for ESORTS is found in DoD Instruction (DoDI) 4715.6,
     Environmental Compliance. The instruction outlines Federal, Department of Defense, and Air
     Force requirements for environmental enforcement actions. The overall objective of the guidance
     is to ensure effective communication to senior AF leaders of the overall status of the environmen-
     tal management program and ultimately protection of the environment.
     13.1.2.2. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 13101 et seq., is the primary statute.
     Under the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA), EPA establishes programs to reduce, reuse, and recycle
     waste generated from all sources.
  13.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
  requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
  provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
  sound engineering and/or environmental practices which maintain environmental compliance.
  13.1.4. Applicability. The policy guidance in this chapter is applicable to all ACC installation
  including overseas locations.
  13.1.5. Key Definitions:
     13.1.5.1. Nonhazardous Industrial/Special Waste. Any industrial waste that is not character-
     ized as hazardous, but still requires special handling or regulatory procedures. Wastes that are part
     of the municipal solid waste stream are not included.
     13.1.5.2. Disposed. Any waste as defined above that was sent off the installation for disposal
     through landfilling, incineration, or other means of disposal.
     13.1.5.3. On Site Recycled Waste. Any process waste as defined above that is reclaimed on the
     installation. This would include on-site recycling of nonhazardous antifreeze, or on-site burning
     of used oil for energy recovery.
     13.1.5.4. Off Site Recycled Waste. Any process waste as defined above that is reclaimed off the
     installation. This would include off-site recycling of nonhazardous antifreeze, or on-site burning
     of used oil for energy recovery.
178                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         13.1.5.5. Mission Change Waste. Waste associated with an acquired or transferred mission. The
         1992 baseline will be adjusted to reflect that change in mission (e.g., Waste associated with a new
         squadron of F-15s would be added to the 1992 baseline to make the figures more accurate. If the
         squadron has left the base, the associated waste will be subtracted.).

13.2. Environmental Assessment Program.
      13.2.1. The Environmental Status of Resources and Training System (ESORTS) is a method of com-
      municating the health of environmental management programs to senior AF leaders. Based on the
      Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS), the combat readiness reporting system, ESORTS
      uses a 4-point scale to characterize environmental management program health.
         13.2.1.1. E-1. No Problems.
         13.2.1.2. E-2. Minor Problems.
         13.2.1.3. E-3. Major Problems.
         13.2.1.4. E-4. Program Failure.
      13.2.2. The ESORTS rating is composed of two parts, the criteria rating and the installation com-
      mander's rating. Similar to SORTS, the installation commander's rating is reported as the overall rat-
      ing for the installation. Criteria and pillars are rated to inform the commander of the status of certain
      key areas of the environmental program. The installation commander will make the final assessment
      of their environmental program health rating.
      13.2.3. The rating criteria are key aspects of environmental management that reasonably characterize
      the condition of the overall environmental management program. The criteria are grouped by "pillar":
      Compliance, Compliance Through Pollution Prevention (CTP2), Conservation, and Restoration
      (Table 13.2.). Rating scales for each criterion were designed to provide realistic assessment of each
      key area. This organization also allows ESORTS to be used for resource advocacy.

  13.2.4. ESORTS uses the worst criterion rating to determine the overall pillar rating, similar to
  SORTS. For example, if three criteria are rated E-2 and one is rated E-4, then the pillar rating is E-4.
  In turn, the worst rated pillar defines the overall E-rating recommendation to the installation com-
  mander. For example, if three pillars are rated E-1 and one is rated E-3, then the overall E-rating is
  E-3. The commander retains discretion to adjust the rating. Many factors not considered in the
  ESORTS criteria may lead to the E-rating adjustment, including recent ESOHCAMP results (internal
  or external), regulatory inspection results, program or individual awards, and base-specific conditions
  not considered in the ratings. The example in Figure 13.1. shows one way of presenting ESORTS at
  base-level briefings. Each pillar's rating is reported, as well as the overall rating assigned by the com-
  mander.

      13.2.5. ESORTS ratings are reported quarterly to HQ ACC/CEVQP, Compliance Through Pollution
      Prevention Section. (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)8603, Report of Notices of Violation and Non-compli-
      ance; RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)9421, Water and Wastewater Programs and Inventories). A separate
      Excel spreadsheet is provided electronically to assist with rating calculations. Submit this spreadsheet
      electronically to the ACC/CEVQP ESORTS Program Manager. Follow the electronic report with a
      signed hard copy by fax (DSN 574-9369) or mail. Reports are due by the 15th of the month following
      the quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct). If the 15th is a holiday or weekend, reports are due the next duty
      day. Mail copies of ESORTS report to: HQ ACC/CEVQP, 129 Andrew Street Suite 102, Langley
      AFB VA 23665-2769
      13.2.6. Reports should include details explaining any criteria, pillar, or overall rating of E-3 or E-4.
      As a minimum, discuss the specific issues causing the low rating, corrective action needed, or in
      progress to attain at least E-2 status, and the estimated completion date of the corrective action. Con-
      tact CEVQP at DSN 574-9316 if there are any questions.

   13.3.1. Open Enforcement Actions (OEAs) are defined in DoDI 4715.6 as "an enforcement action
   that has been issued but is not yet closed by one of the resolutions described under…closed enforce-
   ment action". An open OEA is further categorized by ACC as pending or unresolved.
      13.3.1.1. Pending. OEA for corrective actions completed, but remains open, pending agreement
      by regulator that it is closed.
      13.3.1.2. Unresolved. OEA for corrective actions not yet completed by receiving installation.
      13.3.1.3. A closed OEA is one that is resolved in one of the following ways:
          13.3.1.3.1. Revocation by the imposing regulator.
          13.3.1.3.2. Closure of the action following written notice from the regulator that the action is
          closed.
          13.3.1.3.3. Closure of the action after a reasonable period of time (60 days), following written
          notice to the regulator of intent to close the enforcement action.
          13.3.1.3.4. Receipt of a signed compliance agreement or order.
      13.3.1.4. Points are assigned as follows:
          13.3.1.4.1. One (1.0) point for each OEA received during the quarter (regardless of status).
          13.3.1.4.2. One (1.0) point for each unresolved OEA carried over from previous quarter(s).
          13.3.1.4.3. Zero point two-five (0.25) points for each pending OEA, and for OEAs if correc-
          tive action is completed to the extent that maintenance, monitoring, or reporting over extended
          period of operation is the only remaining requirement.
          13.3.1.4.4. Overseas bases determine OEA status by following guidance in HQ USAF/ILEV
          Memo, dated 2Feb 98, Host Nation Open Enforcement Actions (HNOEA) and assign points:
              13.3.1.4.4.1. E-1. 0 points.
              13.3.1.4.4.2. E-2. 0.25-0.75 points.
              13.3.1.4.4.3. E-3. 1-1.75 points.
              13.3.1.4.4.4. E-4. 2 points or greater.
      13.3.1.5. Table 13.3. provides an example on how to score OEAs:

Table 13.3. Example OEA Scoring Method.
          One NOV received during the quarter                            100.00 points
          One NOV from last quarter closed by end of this quarter        0.00 points
          One NOV for groundwater now in long term monitoring            0.25 points
          TOTAL POINTS (E-3 Rating)                                      1.25 points

   13.3.2. Environmental Permits:
      13.3.2.1. Compliance with environmental permits is the foundation of good environmental man-
      agement. Increased regulatory attention, sovereign immunity waivers, and potential personal lia-
182                               ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      bility further magnify the need for compliance with the various permits our installations hold.
      Permits for consideration include, but are not limited to:
         13.3.2.1.1. Title V Air Permits.
         13.3.2.1.2. NPDES permits.
         13.3.2.1.3. Solid Waste Landfill Permits.
         13.3.2.1.4. Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, or Disposal (RCRA Part B) permit.
         13.3.2.1.5. Any other necessary environmental permits.
         13.3.2.1.6. Applicable state and local permits (air, hazardous waste, storm water, etc.).
      13.3.2.2. Each base should review its own permit requirements to ensure complete coverage.
      Additional inspections or measurements should not be done only for the purpose of ESORTS
      reporting. Permit compliance should be rated based on information known or discovered in the
      normal course of business. For example, monthly reports may be required for some permits (i.e.,
      NPDES), while another requires only an annual report which summarizes weekly monitoring (i.e.,
      air), and a third (i.e., groundwater) is sampled quarterly. In this example, a base would be aware
      weekly of their compliance with the air permit requirements, while only monthly of NPDES com-
      pliance, and only quarterly for groundwater.
      13.3.2.3. Number of permit violations is not considered in the E-rating. However, this can be
      considered in the commander's overall rating.
      13.3.2.4. Ratings:
         13.3.2.4.1. E-l. All permits current and base is complying with all permits to include all the
         conditions of each permit. Base has completed corrective action during the rating period for
         items identified in a previous rating period.
         13.3.2.4.2. E-2. One or more permits in renewal phase pending action by regulator or base
         has identified noncompliant items and completed corrective action during the rating period.
         All actions have been completed by the base to secure the permit to include timely submission
         for renewal, but the permit issuing regulatory agency has not responded and the permit has or
         will soon expire.
         13.3.2.4.3. E-3. One or more permits in renewal phase pending action by base or base has
         identified noncompliant items and corrective action in progress but not closed during rating
         period
         13.3.2.4.4. E-4. One or more necessary permits expired or base has identified noncompliant
         items and renewal/corrective action not initiated/continued on schedule during rating period
         13.3.2.4.5. Example. Review status of permits. Any permit requiring action drops the rating
         from E-l, regardless of whether required action is on the part of the wing or another entity.
         (This acknowledges that the permit is not in place.) If action is required by the wing, then rat-
         ing is no greater than E-3. If action is required outside the wing, for example, by the permit
         issuing regulatory agency, then the rating is E-2 to show minor problems and action is
         required.
      13.3.2.5. Renewals. One permit is past renewal date and awaiting regulator approval. The rating
      is E-2 (pending action by others).
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          183


         13.3.2.5.1. Noncompliance. A permit violation is discovered on 3 Mar. Corrective action
         starts 3 Apr after consultation with regulators and ECAS contracting action. Corrective action
         is completed on 30 Jul. Regulators visit site and agree action is complete. Rating for 2nd Qtr
         (Jan - Mar) is E-4 (no action had started at the end of Mar). Rating for 3rd Qtr (Apr - Jun) is
         E-3 (corrective action started but not complete). Rating for 4th Qtr is E-1 (action completed
         for item identified in previous quarter).
  13.3.3. Designs, And Construction Execution. To prepare for prompt execution of requirements,
  designs for projects must be complete one fiscal year preceding the current execution fiscal year (FY).
  CEVQ will provide bases electronic Excel spreadsheets with their ESORTS reporting designs and
  projects locked to assist with rating calculations. NOTE: changes have been made in the ESORTS
  rating criteria and rating spreadsheets calculations for Design Award Goal, Design Complete Goal,
  RTA Goal, Contract Method Initiated, and Award Goal percentages based on dollar value of projects
  rather than number of projects. The intent is to measure bases execution results around programs fund
  allocation effectiveness in meeting Command milestones. Also, ratings are more liberal to provide a
  better indication of the overall health of bases environmental management programs.
     13.3.3.1. Project execution milestones are as follows. (NOTE: FY = the fiscal year of project
     execution):
         13.3.3.1.1. 1 Feb FY-4. Award concept designs.
         13.3.3.1.2. 1 Feb FY-3. Complete concept designs.
         13.3.3.1.3. 1 Feb FY-2. Award designs.
         13.3.3.1.4. 1 Feb FY-1. Complete designs.
         13.3.3.1.5. 1 Mar FY-1. Submit DD Form 1391/1391c.
         13.3.3.1.6. 15 Mar FY-1. Project must be Ready-To-Advertise (RTA).
     13.3.3.2. Designs in Support of Construction:
         13.3.3.2.1. To ensure prompt execution of requirements, design for projects must be awarded
         by 15 Mar, two years preceding the current execution fiscal year (FY). Designs should be
         complete by 15 Mar, one year preceding the current execution year. In the ESORTS work-
         sheet, project designs are rated using the Design Dollars Award Date for the First Quarter and
         the Design Dollars Completion Date for the Second, Third and Fourth Quarters. Late Award
         and Completion Dates have been added to allow bases the opportunity for improvement if they
         do not meet the original deadline. If the original deadline is not met, bases can still receive an
         E-2 rating by reaching 100% completion by the end of the current quarter. NOTE: If a design
         is done in-house, enter "I/H" in the "Awarded Act Date" column of the rating spreadsheets.
         13.3.3.2.2. Quarterly Rating Criteria are as follows:
             13.3.3.2.2.1. First Quarter, (Design $$ Awarded) 15 March, two years preceding FY of
             execution:

      13.3.4. FY2001 Designs in Support of FY 2003 Construction:
         13.3.4.1. The rating system below is used to ensure that bases are making steady progress to
         reaching the design completion goal of 15 March. Designs are rated using a graduated scale
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                       185


    beginning in the Third Quarter. The rating criteria is low in the Third Quarter but increases up to
    15 Mar, when 100% of designs should be complete.
       13.3.4.1.1. Quarterly Rating Criteria are as follows:
           13.3.4.1.1.1. 1st Quarter (Design $$ Completed) 31 December, one year preceding FY of
           execution:
               13.3.4.1.1.1.1. E-1. 75% or > Design $$ Completed.
               13.3.4.1.1.1.2. E-2. 50-74% Design $$ Completed.
               13.3.4.1.1.1.3. E-3. 25-49% Design $$ Completed.
               13.3.4.1.1.1.4. E-4. < 25% Design $$ Completed.

       13.3.4.1.2. 2nd Quarter (Design $$ Awarded) 15 March, two years preceding the FY of exe-
       cution. NOTE: The 2nd Quarter Rating will be determined using the worst criterion rating
       system mentioned earlier in this document. For instance, if the Design Dollars Completed rat-
       ing is E-2 and the Design Dollar Awarded rating is E-3, the 2nd Quarter rating will be E-3 (the
       worst of the two):
           13.3.4.1.2.1. E-1. 90-100% Design $$ Awarded or Scheduled for In-house Design.
           13.3.4.1.2.2. E-2. 50-89% Design $$ Awarded or Scheduled for In-house Design.
           13.3.4.1.2.3. E-3. < 50% Design $$ Awarded or Scheduled for In-house Design.

    13.3.4.2. Examples:
       13.3.4.2.1. Base requires 10 projects (each project costs $10,000) - six of the projects totaling
       $60,000 will be contracted and four projects totaling $40,000 will be accomplished in-house.
       In the 2nd quarter five of the contracted designs worth $50,000 are awarded. Rating is E-1;

            90% ($90,000/$100,000) of design funding is awarded or being accomplished in-house
            ($50,000 contracted, $40,000 in-house).
            13.3.4.2.2. Base requires six designs totaling $600,000, four of the projects totaling $500,000
            are contracted and two in-house projects totaling $100,000 are done in-house. In the 4th quar-
            ter two contracted projects worth $400,000 and the two in-house projects totaling $100,000
            are completed. Rating is E-1; 83% complete ($500,000/$600,000).
      13.3.5. FY2002 Construction Execution:
         13.3.5.1. Prompt execution of non-recurring, Level 1, project requirements are required to ensure
         non-compliant situations are corrected before funds are redistributed to other requirements. Our
         objective is to straddle bid the entire environmental facility program for an approaching FY during
         the fourth quarter of the preceding FY. To do so requires you to have your projects for an
         approaching FY ready to advertise (RTA) through your local base contracting office by 15 May of
         the preceding FY. RTA means your Invitation for Bids must be completed and ready to go to con-
         tracting by 15 May. Bases electing to use other contract methods may find themselves unable to
         meet the Command's execution milestones. Through the teamwork of your engineering and envi-
         ronmental flight chiefs and base contracting officer your installations should be able to award
         100% of your environmental facility program by 15 Jan of execution year. Due to increased com-
         petition for resources, projects that fail to stay on schedule will be replaced by moving unfunded
         executable projects into the funded area. In summary, bases must execute their funded program by
         the milestones or funds may be withdrawn to support other Command unfunded, priority Level 1
         project requirements. Therefore, it is essential for bases to be ready to bid and award unfunded
         project requirements if they want to compete for funds that may become available because funded
         projects failed to meet milestones.
         13.3.5.2. All funded Level 1 project requirements must be awarded by 15 Jan (2nd Qtr) in the FY
         of execution. To best ensure this, projects must be ready to advertise (RTA) by 15 May (3rd Qtr)
         preceding the FY of execution and out for invitation for bid (IFB) (i.e., advertised) by 15 Jun (3rd
         Qtr) preceding the FY of execution. Project requirements that do not require IFB, like SABER
         and AFCEE supported projects, should be ready to award by 15 Dec (1st Qtr) in the FY of execu-
         tion. ACC/CEV will work exceptions or modifications to this criteria based on actual funds distri-
         bution and support by ACC/FM and ACC/LGC.
      13.3.6. Using the Level 1 Execution spreadsheet:
         13.3.6.1. Enter the current ACC funds allocation amount. If a base does not have the current
         amount, they can contact ACC/CEVQ for the correct number.
         13.3.6.2. Enter project numbers, titles, priorities, project amounts, execution methods, and dates
         for all funded and unfunded Level 1 project requirements in the forthcoming execution FY.
         13.3.6.3. Funded requirements are entered in the "Above Funding Line" section.
         13.3.6.4. Unfunded requirements are entered in the "Below Funding Line" section. Bases should
         continue to pursue preparation and contracting of these requirements. ACC will aggressively pur-
         sue additional funding for these requirements and will fund in priority order as many as are exe-
         cutable.
         13.3.6.5. If the base chooses to fund an unfunded requirement, move the requirement from
         "Below" to "Above".
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                       187


     13.3.6.6. If ACC funds an unfunded requirement, move the requirement from "Below" to
     "Above." ACC will provide a new allocation amount, which will be the original allocation plus
     the estimated or actual amount of the new requirement.
     13.3.6.7. If the base elects to not fund a requirement, move the requirement from "Above" to
     "Below" and continue to report any available data.
     13.3.6.8. Emergent requirements can displace requirement(s) "Above" or be added "Below." The
     total funded amount cannot exceed allocation, unless the base contributes some of its funds to cor-
     rect non-compliant conditions. Move any displaced requirements to "Below".
     13.3.6.9. Estimated dates will be entered for RTA, Contract Method Initiated, and Award for the
     3rd quarter report preceding FY of execution.
     13.3.6.10. If a requirement is not bid (IFB), enter "N/A" in the estimated and actual Contract
     Method (As Required) columns of the rating spreadsheets.
     13.3.6.11. ACC/CEV will periodically evaluate the bases' programs for effective use of alloca-
     tions.
     13.3.6.12. Unused allocation can be withdrawn from bases and redirected to other valid,
     unfunded Level 1 requirements within the Command.
     13.3.6.13. Bases not using all their allocation and continuing to identify unfunded requirements
     are still vulnerable to having allocation withdrawn.
  13.3.7. Quarterly Goals:
     13.3.7.1. Ratings:
        13.3.7.1.1. 1st Quarter, Goal Date - 15 Dec in the FY of execution. For Non-IFB project
        requirements:
            13.3.7.1.1.1. E-1. 100% Non-IFB project requirement $$ Ready to Award.

                13.3.7.1.4.4. E-4. Less than 60% Out for IFB, Contract Method Initiated.
         13.3.7.2. Examples:
            13.3.7.2.1. Base has $1 million in Level 1 requirements. In the 1st quarter, all $1M is RTA
            ($500K is out for IFB and $300K is non-IFB RTA). Rating is E-2; 80% of requirements are
            out for IFB and/or 100% RTA.
            13.3.7.2.2. Base has $300K in Level 1 requirements. In the 2nd quarter, three projects total-
            ing $200K are awarded. One $100K IFB requirement is not out for bid. Rating is E-4; all
            requirements must be out for IFB or RTA for non-IFB requirements by the end of the 1st quar-
            ter.
            13.3.7.2.3. Base has $800K in Level 1 requirements. In the 3rd quarter, $760K is awarded,
            remainder are RTA. Rating is E-2; 95% of requirements are awarded.
      13.3.8. Environmental Safety an Occupational Health Compliance Assessment and Manage-
      ment Program (ESOH CAMP) Findings:
         13.3.8.1. These criteria are based on comparison of actual closures of environmental high-risk
         findings in the most recent external ESOHCAMP compared to the Management Action Plan
         (MAP) scheduled closures. External ESOHCAMPs remain on a three-year cycle. The ESO-
         HCAMP Environmental Management System (EEMS) program produces reports containing this
         information. Contact the installation ESOHCAMP program manager for more information.
         13.3.8.2. Ratings:
            13.3.8.2.1. E-1. On or ahead of schedule.
            13.3.8.2.2. E-2. 90-99% on schedule.
            13.3.8.2.3. E-3. 75-89% on schedule.
            13.3.8.2.4. E-4. Less than 75% on schedule.
         13.3.8.3. Reporting Period. The base will report environmental high risk findings closure rates
         for the most recent external ESOHCAMP, beginning the first full quarter following the base's most
         recent external assessment. Example: Its Feb (2nd Qtr). Your most recent external ESOHCAMP
         was in Jan. The ESORTS report for the current quarter (Jan-Mar) is due in April. Since the latest
         ESOHCAMP was completed during the current quarter, the April ESORTS will report on findings
         remaining from the previous ESOHCAMP. The reportable findings from the Jan ESOHCAMP
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                      189


    will begin the following quarter's (3rd Qtr, Apr-Jun) ESORTS. This allows the base to establish
    their MAP for the most recent ESOHCAMP prior to reporting in ESORTS.
    13.3.8.4. Calculation:
       13.3.8.4.1. Scheduled Closure Rate. The total number of environmental high-risk findings
       scheduled to be closed to date (this quarter and previous quarters) is divided by the total num-
       ber of findings scheduled to be closed to date which were actually closed at the end of the
       quarter (Do not count findings closed early). Percentage may not exceed 100%.
       13.3.8.4.2. Overall vs Scheduled Closure Percentage (Info Only - Not Rated). The total
       number of environmental high-risk findings scheduled to close is divided by the total number
       of findings closed at the end of the quarter; this includes findings closed early. Percentage
       "may" exceed 100%, giving the base the opportunity to show progress beyond the scheduled
       closure plan.
       13.3.8.4.3. Example. Latest external ESOHCAMP resulted in 40 environmental high-risk
       findings.
           13.3.8.4.3.1. Ten findings are scheduled to close by the end of the 1st full quarter follow-
           ing the ESOHCAMP. The base actually closed twelve findings as follows: Closed 8 of the
           10 findings that were scheduled to be closed during the current quarter. Closed 4 addi-
           tional findings that were scheduled to be closed in the 2nd quarter. The Scheduled Closure
           rating is 8/10 or 80% of scheduled findings = rating of E-3. Only count findings scheduled
           to close during the current or previous quarters. The Overall vs Scheduled Closure Per-
           centage is 12/10 or 120%.
           13.3.8.4.3.2. For the next quarter (2nd), 10 more findings are scheduled to be closed. This
           makes for a total of 20 findings now scheduled to be closed (10 from the 1st Qtr, + 10 from
           the 2nd Qtr). Closed 5 of the 10 findings that were scheduled to be closed during the 2nd
           quarter. Four of this quarter's (2nd) 10 findings were closed previously during the 1st
           quarter. In addition, you closed the 2 findings left over from the previous quarter (1st).
           This makes a total of 19 of 20 scheduled findings closed to date, (12 from the previous
           quarter + 5 from the current quarter + 2 from the previous quarter. The Scheduled Closure
           rating is 19/20 (95%) of scheduled findings = rating of E-1. The Overall vs Scheduled Per-
           centage is 19/20 (95%).
       13.3.8.4.4. Internal ESOHCAMP Assessments (Info Only):
           13.3.8.4.4.1. ACC bases are required to conduct an internal assessment each calendar year
           in which they do not have a scheduled external ESOHCAMP (AFI 32-7045, Environmen-
           tal Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP)). Each base has the
           option to include safety and occupational health to make a combined ESOHCAMP.
       13.3.8.4.5. In the quarterly ESORTS report, include the following information:
           13.3.8.4.5.1. The date (month/year) of the last internal ECAMP/ESOHCAMP. Regard-
           less of the size or scope, if the base is conducting internal assessments on a more frequent
           basis (i.e., quarterly, semiannual) list the date of the last assessment.
           13.3.8.4.5.2. The date (month/year) of the next scheduled ECAMP/ESOHCAMP assess-
           ment. If none is scheduled at the time of the ESORTS report, indicate "Not Scheduled".

      13.3.9. Compliance Through Pollution Prevention Program:
         13.3.9.1. Hazardous Material Pharmacy Program (HAZMART):
            13.3.9.1.1. Registering all shops using hazardous materials (HM) with the HAZMART, or
            other approved source of supply (SOS), is fundamental to controlling and tracking HM use.
            Therefore the percent of shops using HM that are working through the HAZMART, or an
            approved SOS, is an important indicator of the success of the program.
            13.3.9.1.2. Definition of Environmental Management Information System (EMIS) connectiv-
            ity:
               13.3.9.1.2.1. To answer "yes" to full HAZMART EMIS connectivity the installation must
               have designated EMIS terminals that link the HAZMART with the three HM authorizing
               offices that complete the 3952 process. The electronic 3952 process will be in place and an
               authorizing office may view purchases of HM through data-link, thus minimizing purchase
               of HM if it is already available at a different location.
               13.3.9.1.2.2. To answer "yes" to full SOS EMIS connectivity, all SOSs must have the
               above system in place as well. This will not be used to calculate your ESORTS rating.
         13.3.9.2. Hazardous Waste (HW) Reduction:
            13.3.9.2.1. HW disposal is one of the most vulnerable enforcement action areas for Air Force
            environmental activities. Reducing the amount of disposal directly reduces risk to our people,
            environment, and programs. Waste disposal is also indicative of other aspects of the environ-
            mental program (HAZMART, pollution prevention, and HW management). See Appendix A
            attached for additional instructions and definitions.
            13.3.9.2.2. The ESORTS criterion incorporates the Air Force goal for HW disposal reduction.
            The goal is to reach a cumulative reduction from a 1992 baseline of 18% in calendar year (CY)
            95, 25% in CY96, 33% in CY97, 42% in CY98, and 50% in CY99. In the absence of new
            goals from Air Staff, we will continue to pursue the following ACC CY goals: 2000 - 56%,
            2001 - 62%, 2003 - 68%, 2004 - 74% and 2005 - 80%.
               13.3.9.2.2.1. Ratings:
                   13.3.9.2.2.1.1. E-1. Met CY goal.
                   13.3.9.2.2.1.2. E-2. Met at least 85% of CY goal.
                   13.3.9.2.2.1.3. E-3. Met at least 70% of CY goal.
                   13.3.9.2.2.1.4. E-4. Met less than 70% of CY goal.
               13.3.9.2.2.2. Calculation:
                   13.3.9.2.2.2.1. Annual Reduction Goal = Baseline Amount - (Baseline Amount x CY
                   Reduction Goal %).
                   13.3.9.2.2.2.2. Adjusted Disposal Total = Total CY to Date (CYTD) Disposed
                   Off-Site + Total CYTD Recycled Off-Site - Total CYTD One-Time Waste.
                   13.3.9.2.2.2.3. Estimated Annual Disposal = (Adjusted Disposal Total x 4) / CY Quar-
                   ter (1, 2, 3, or 4).
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        191


                  13.3.9.2.2.2.4. Actual Reduction Rate = 1 - (Estimated Annual Disposal/1992 Base-
                  line).
                  13.3.9.2.2.2.5. Goal Achievement (%) = Annual Reduction Rate/CY Reduction Goal.
              13.3.9.2.2.3. Example:
                  13.3.9.2.2.3.1. Assume base is computing values for the 1st quarter of CY05 (i.e., 2nd
                  quarter FY05). Required reduction through the end of CY05 is 80% from a baseline
                  year of 50,000 lbs, equaling 40,000 lb. Annual reduction goal (or maximum disposal)
                  is: 50,000 - 40,000 = 10,000 lbs. Assume HW disposal for 1st quarter of CY05 is
                  2,150 lb, then estimated annual disposal is: 2150 x (4/1) = 8,600. Actual Reduction
                  Rate is: 1 - (8,600/50,000) = 0.83 or 83%. Goal Achievement, or how much was actu-
                  ally reduced compared to required reduction, is: 0.83/0.80 = 1.03 or 103%. This is a
                  E-1 rating because goal achievement is above 100%, indicating base is ahead of goal.
   13.3.10. Integrated Solid Waste:
       13.3.10.1. Solid waste reduction is an essential area characterizing pollution prevention program
       effectiveness. Solid waste generation and reduction are areas in which the entire base contributes
       to program success. Few (if any) other environmental protocols can make that claim. Perfor-
       mance is based on achievement of the ACC solid waste diversion goals and integrated solid waste
       management program costs, which reflect the goals established by the 13 May 98 DoD Pollution
       Prevention Measure of Merit.
       13.3.10.2. The "Non-Hazardous Solid Waste Diversion Rate" Measure of Merit is "By the end of
       FY2005, ensure the diversion rate for non-hazardous solid waste is greater than 40%, while ensur-
       ing integrated non-hazardous solid waste management programs provide an economic benefit
       when compared with disposal using landfilling and incineration alone." ACC will use the follow-
       ing interim Air Staff metrics (Table 13.4.):

            13.3.10.4.1. Diverted Material. Non-hazardous solid waste that is recycled, composted,
            mulched, reused, donated or otherwise diverted from a disposal facility. It is the Qualified
            Recycling Program (QRP) manager's responsibility to ensure SW and recycling data from
            Defense Reutilization and Marketing Organization (DRMO), Army and Air Force Exchange
            Service (AAFES) and Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is obtained. This data may be
            estimated if necessary. Material items sold/transferred/donated through DRMO include all
            items that are processed through DRMO whether scrap or a functional item that would have
            gone to a landfill.
            13.3.10.4.2. Disposed Material. Non-hazardous solid waste that is sent to a landfill (both
            solid waste and inert) and incinerators (waste only). Medical waste incinerated and fuel con-
            taminated soil is not to be included in either diverted or disposed material since they are con-
            sidered "special waste".
            13.3.10.4.3. C&D Debris. Waste building materials, (including wood, windows, doors, elec-
            trical panels, asphalt millings, and concrete demolition), packaging, and rubble resulting from
            construction, remodeling, repair, and demolition operations of pavements, residences, build-
            ings, and other structures. Please enter appropriate data for C&D debris recycled and dis-
            posed.
            13.3.10.4.4. Waste-to-Energy Incinerated Waste. Debris that is sent to an on-base or local
            waste-to-energy incineration plant only. This metric does not include medical waste sent to a
            medical incinerator.
            13.3.10.4.5. Calculation for Solid Waste Management:
                13.3.10.4.5.1. Obtain Values for solid waste recycled, composted, mulched (if applicable),
                reused (if applicable), donated (if applicable), and disposed in tons for INDIVIDUAL
                QUARTER BEING REPORTED. Total Material Diverted from Disposal = Tons Recycled
                + Composted + Mulched + Reused + Donated. Total Solid Waste Generated = Tons Dis-
                posed + Tons Diverted. Waste Diversion Rate = Total Material Diverted from Disposal /
                Total Solid Waste Generated. Goal Achievement = Waste Diversion Rate / FY Diversion
                Goal. E-Ratings are measured against the FY diversion goal.
                13.3.10.4.5.2. Construction and Demolition (C&D) Debris. Enter amounts of C&D
                Debris disposed and recycled in tons for INDIVIDUAL QUARTER BEING REPORTED.
                C&D Debris Generated = C&D Debris Disposed + C&D Debris Recycled. C&D Debris
                will not be included in the overall waste diversion rate.
                13.3.10.4.5.3. Waste-to-Energy Incineration Data. Enter the amount in tons of material
                that is sent to a waste-to-energy incineration plant. This amount will not be included in the
                overall waste diversion rate. Please see the "Air Force Reporting Requirements", 26 Jan
                99, the supplement to the DoD Measure of Merit for further information.

13.4. Environmental Restoration Program:
   13.4.1. Environmental Restoration Program (ERP) Management. Each base has its own ERP
   management based on three factors: Currency of the Management Action Plan, Close out schedule of
   high-risk sites, and Training. Each factor will have a rating scale, with the lowest of the three factors
   determining the rating.
      13.4.1.1. Management Action Plan Status. AF ERP policy guidance requires the MAP be
      revised annually. Pen and ink corrections and re-certifications are not acceptable.

          13.4.1.2.4. E-4. MAP is more than 18 months old.
      13.4.1.3. Example. The ERP MAP was last updated 13 months ago, then the rating is E-2
      because the plan is more than 12 months but not more than 15 months old.
   13.4.2. Cleanup Action Schedule Status. The rating is based only on cleanup action at high-risk
   sites. The limiting factor is the date cleanup action is in place at the last high-risk site in the cleanup
   plan.
      13.4.2.1. Ratings:
          13.4.2.1.1. E-1. On schedule to have cleanup action in place at all high risk sites by the end
          of FY07.
          13.4.2.1.2. E-2. Behind schedule by 1year. Cleanup action will be in place at all high-risk
          sites by the end of FY08.
          13.4.2.1.3. E-3. Behind schedule by 2 years. Cleanup action will be in place at all high-risk
          sites by the end of FY09.
          13.4.2.1.4. E-4. Behind schedule by more than 3 years. Cleanup action will not be in place at
          all high-risk sites by the end of FY10.
      13.4.2.2. Example. Assume there are 10 high-risk sites with eight to have cleanup action in place
      by FY02, one to have cleanup action in place by the end of FY04, and one not to have cleanup in
      place until FY09. The cleanup action for FY09 is the limiting factor and results in an E-3 rating.
   13.4.3. Training Rating:
      13.4.3.1. E-1. All ERA funded personnel at installation have received HAZWOPER training and
      possess current HAZWOPER certification.
      13.4.3.2. E-2. One ERA funded personnel at the installation does not possess a current
      HAZWOPER certification.
      13.4.3.3. E-3. At least two ERA funded personnel at the installation do not possess a current
      HAZWOPER certification.
      13.4.3.4. E-4. No ERA funded personnel has received HAZWOPER training.

      13.4.4. Complying with ERP Legal Agreements. Each base will assess its compliance with legal
      agreements. Legal agreements were understood to be specific obligations by the base to take action
      according to some binding agreement. This differs from permits in that this criterion refers to restora-
      tion particularly. Permits will be rated under compliance.
         13.4.4.1. Bases without legal agreements should report E-1. For the criteria, the limiting factor is
         not the number of deadlines or when you are scheduled to meet the first milestone but your sched-
         ule to meet all milestones in any applicable legal agreement.
         13.4.4.2. Ratings:
             13.4.4.2.1. E-l. On schedule to meet milestone(s) specified in formal legal agreement. Inves-
             tigation or cleanup timetables in Federal Facility Agreements, Interagency Agreements, Fed-
             eral Facility Site Remediation Agreements, or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
             closure actions, etc., are being met.
             13.4.4.2.2. E-2. Behind schedule, but renegotiating extension requested or underway. Instal-
             lation is renegotiating timetables as a result of resource constraints, new site conditions,
             changes in regulatory policy or other conditions.
             13.4.4.2.3. E-3. Behind schedule and renegotiating extension has not been requested.
             13.4.4.2.4. E-4. Missed milestone(s). Installation is facing enforcement action from regula-
             tory community or has lost in dispute resolution process. Stipulated penalties have been
             assessed.
             13.4.4.2.5. Although the AF and DoD are moving toward using relative risk and Restoration
             Advisory Boards to prioritize cleanup, we must continue to comply with agreements, such as
             Federal Facility Agreements, until we can renegotiate schedules. Missed milestone(s) can
             subject the AF to stipulated fines and penalties.
             13.4.4.2.6. Example: Assume a base has five milestones specified in their formal legal
             agreement and are on schedule to meet four of the five. For the fifth item, the base is behind
             and has not requested an extension, but that milestone has not yet passed. The overall rating is
             E-3.
      13.4.5. Restoration Advisory Board (RAB) Meeting Frequency. ACC Policy requires that RABs
      meet every six months.
         13.4.5.1. Ratings:
             13.4.5.1.1. E-1. RAB met within last six (6) months.
             13.4.5.1.2. E-2. RAB met within last seven (7) months.
             13.4.5.1.3. E-3. RAB met within last eight (8) months.
             13.4.5.1.4. E-4. RAB frequency greater than eight (8) months.
             13.4.5.1.5. Example. If your last RAB meeting was seven months and a few days longer
             from the date the ESORTS information was submitted, then your rating is E-3 because the
             RAB met within the last eight months.
      13.4.6. ERP Funds Obligation. Prompt execution is important to the continued success of the pro-
      gram. Execution is measured as a percentage of the initial distribution for project execution only.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           195

      $720K. The overall funding execution rating is E-3.

13.5. ESORTS Definitions.
   13.5.1. Hazardous Waste Minimization Instructions and Definitions. Use the following informa-
   tion when preparing ESORTS inputs. If figures vary by more than 10 percent per year (in either direc-
   tion), please include a short narrative explaining the reason (mission change, regulatory changes, etc.).
   Before returning the data please review it for accuracy.
      13.5.1.1. Hazardous Waste. Any waste designated as hazardous by definition in 40 CFR 261.3
      or by comparable state regulations.
          13.5.1.1.1. This does not include wastes that are sent off-site that are used as a direct substi-
          tute for a commercial product, or used as an ingredient to make a product without first being
          processed in some manner. These are excluded from the definition of solid waste.
          13.5.1.1.2. It also does not include waste managed under the universal waste requirements of
          40 CFR 273. Those wastes should be captured in the non-hazardous industrial/special waste
          category.
      13.5.1.2. Disposed Hazardous Waste. Any hazardous waste as defined above that was mani-
      fested and disposed of off the installation through DRMO or other government or contract mech-
      anism. This includes any hazardous material that is manifested and disposed of as a hazardous
      waste that is not sold for reuse as a material. Do not include off site recycled. These figures go in
      their respective columns on the form. Do not include non-hazardous wastes that were mistakenly
      manifested as hazardous waste. (e.g., waste oil is not a hazardous waste in most states, but is often
      erroneously identified as a hazardous waste.).
          13.5.1.2.1. Some states may list certain wastes as a nonhazardous or "special" waste (e.g.,
          waste POL, antifreeze, etc.) even though the federal regulations do not identify it as hazard-
          ous; these wastes should not be included in the hazardous waste figures, but should be
          included on the nonhazardous industrial/special waste form.
      13.5.1.3. Off Site Recycled Hazardous Waste. Any process waste as defined above that is
      reclaimed off the installation and results in a usable product. (e.g., Safety Kleen solvent contracts;
      rags that are manifested as HW and taken off site for laundering).
196                                    ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         13.5.1.4. Newly Regulated Waste. Those waste streams that existed in 1992 and 93 that were
         not regulated, but are now considered a hazardous waste by the federal or state regulators. The
         1992 baseline will be adjusted to reflect the change in regulations. Clear documentation must be
         available to defend addition of any newly regulated waste to the baseline.
         13.5.1.5. Mission Change Waste. Hazardous waste associated with an acquired or transferred
         mission. The 1992 baseline will be adjusted to reflect that change in mission. (e.g., Waste associ-
         ated with a new squadron of F-15s would be added to the 1992 baseline to make the figures more
         accurate. If the squadron has left the base, the associated waste will be subtracted.) Clear docu-
         mentation must be available to defend addition of any mission change waste to the baseline.
         13.5.1.6. HW Streams Not Identified in 1992. Hazardous waste streams that were in existence
         in 1992 but were incorrectly characterized as nonhazardous (or not characterized at all) (e.g.,
         Many bases traditionally disposed of oil/water separator sludge as nonhazardous. However,
         proper characterization of the waste streams show them to be hazardous, and they are now dis-
         posed of as such).
         13.5.1.7. One Time Waste. Hazardous waste that results from a one-time project that is not an
         ongoing waste stream. (e.g., A large quantity of paint chips and blast media from a water tower
         stripping job.). Must be clearly explained in the quarterly ESORTS report.
         13.5.1.8. What Should Not Be Counted:
             13.5.1.8.1. Any unused hazardous material that is manifested and turned in for disposal as a
             hazardous waste (due to expired shelf life, no longer needed, etc.) that is "unmanifested" and
             sold for reuse as a virgin material.
             13.5.1.8.2. Any waste excluded under 40 CFR 261.4 (e.g., "household waste," domestic sew-
             age, etc.).
             13.5.1.8.3. PCBs or asbestos waste.
             13.5.1.8.4. Any waste that is treated on base and disposed of as non-hazardous via the sanitary
             sewer or other means. (e.g., Acids or bases that are neutralized and rendered non-hazardous
             and therefore not manifested for disposal).
             13.5.1.8.5. HW resulting from major spills (train derailments, etc.). Minor day-to-day spills
             are counted.
             13.5.1.8.6. HW resulting from IRP cleanup operations.

13.6. Non-hazardous Industrial/Special Waste.
      13.6.1. In an effort to improve our tracking of hazardous and industrial wastes, we would like to sep-
      arate out the wastes that are not technically hazardous, but are not considered municipal solid waste
      either. These wastes are often referred to as nonhazardous industrial, special, or non-hazardous regu-
      lated waste, and typically include wastes like used oil, uncontaminated antifreeze, oil spill cleanup
      wastes, etc. Each state is different, and it is up to the base to determine whether a waste is truly a haz-
      ardous waste, or just a special waste. The intent of this section is to capture information on those
      wastes that are not included in the hazardous waste figures or the municipal solid waste figures. Use
      the attached non-hazardous industrial/special waste form to account for these types of waste. These
      types of wastes may include, but are not limited to the following:
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        197


     13.6.1.1. Used oil as defined and regulated under 40 CFR Part 279.
     13.6.1.2. Antifreeze that does not fail the TCLP or other hazardous waste determination test.
     13.6.1.3. Pads and other spill cleanup waste that does not fail the TCLP or other hazardous waste
     determination test.
     13.6.1.4. Fluorescent light bulbs (unless they are managed as hazardous waste).
     13.6.1.5. Lead acid batteries (if not included in the hazardous waste figures, generators of lead
     acid batteries destined for recycling are not subject to the requirements of RCRA).
     13.6.1.6. Nonhazardous paints (latex, etc.).
  13.6.2. The Non-hazardous Industrial/Special Waste section does not include scrap metals, fuels no
  longer usable as aircraft fuels but usable as fuel for other equipment, and asbestos.

                                                 Chapter 14

                 ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD (EIIB)
                      INVESTIGATION, REPORTING, AND TRACKING

14.1. General Requirements. The purpose of the EIIB is threefold: to investigate, distribute "lessons
learned," and prevent recurrence. The policy objective is for the command to have a process for investi-
gating environmental incidents similar to the one the Air Force uses to investigate aircraft accidents.

14.2. Applicability. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, ACC activities at overseas locations,
ACC geographically separated units (GSUs) and collocated tenant units. This guidance does not apply to
Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFRES) units. ANG and AFRES units have similar
reporting requirements to their respective headquarters. ACC tenant units located on installations belong-
ing to other major commands (MAJCOMs) shall follow these guidelines and coordinate reports through
the host installation.
      14.2.1. Natural disasters or other Acts of God that directly cause environmental incidents do not gen-
      erally require EIIB investigations. If however, the cleanup is poorly managed, a preventative system
      fails, or mitigation is not properly accomplished, an EIIB may be required. Ask ACC/CEVQ to
      decide.

14.3. Responsibilities:
      14.3.1. The ACC Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Council (ESOH Council Chair-
      man (Chief, Environmental Programs Division (HQ ACC/CEV)):
         14.3.1.1. Manages the EIIB program IAW this manual.
         14.3.1.2. Reviews EIIB reports and makes additional recommendations as applicable (RCS:
         HAF-CEV(AR) 9432, Immediate Report of Enforcement Action).
         14.3.1.3. Appoints Category 1 EIIB members, as required, and provides for their temporary duty
         (TDY) funding.
         14.3.1.4. Maintains incident records, tracks status, develops statistical data and disseminates
         reports as required.
      14.3.2. The wing commander:
         14.3.2.1. Determines the investigative category.
         14.3.2.2. Supports Category 1 investigation boards, appoints Category 2 board members, and
         appoints Category 3 investigating officers (IOs).
         14.3.2.3. Sees that suspenses are met, ensures an effective investigation, and approves the final
         report
         14.3.2.4. Ensures that lessons learned from other installations are fully incorporated into the wing
         policies and procedures to prevent similar occurrences.
         14.3.2.5. In concert with PA, JA, and environmental, considers notifying state and local officials
         prior to releasing information about Category 1 or 2 incidents.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                          199


   14.3.3. The wing office of the staff judge advocate (JA) and the Office of Special Investigations
   (OSI) must jointly clear the incident site and data as described below. JA must also provide a briefing
   for all EIIB members prior to their beginning the EIIB process. This briefing will:
       14.3.3.1. Provide members with basic training on investigative techniques.
       14.3.3.2. Explain that the purpose of the investigation is to prevent recurrence and that the infor-
       mation provided is not privileged.
       14.3.3.3. Explain that it is normally unnecessary for interviewees to be informed of their rights
       under Article 31 UCMJ or the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.
   14.3.4. Public affairs (PA) shall be proactive and employ the "maximum disclosure/minimum delay"
   philosophy. As such, PA shall:
       14.3.4.1. Publicize suitable warnings or precautionary measures as soon as possible if there is a
       threat to human health.
       14.3.4.2. Publicize all newsworthy environmental incidents to the maximum extent.
       14.3.4.3. Withhold no information for query only if there is a significant threat to the environment
       or to human health.
   14.3.5. The environmental flight chief will:
       14.3.5.1. Ensure notification to ACC/CE through the wing commander.
       14.3.5.2. Support IOs and boards with technical expertise.
       14.3.5.3. Keep ACC/CEVQ updated on status.
       14.3.5.4. In consultation with JA, notify appropriate regulatory agencies of incidents, as required
       by law.

14.4. Category Determination. The investigative level is determined by the relative seriousness of each
incident. The threshold for an investigative category is met if any one of the statements following it is
met.
   14.4.1. Category 1:
       14.4.1.1. Receipt of an enforcement action with fine of $200,000 or more.
       14.4.1.2. A substance release costing $200,000 or more to mitigate (NOTE: cost of lost product
       is not included in mitigation cost).
       14.4.1.3. Release of 10,000 gallons or more of a petroleum product (The amount of release means
       the total amount released from its original container even if contained within a dyke, berm, or
       other secondary containment system. The amount for regulatory reporting purposes may only be
       the amount released to the environment).
       14.4.1.4. A substance release above its regulatory Reportable Quantity (RQ) that damages the
       public health, safety, or the environment.
       14.4.1.5. A release or bypass of 100,000 gallons or more of sewage, except in case of widespread
       flooding.

         14.4.1.7. The incident is sensitive or serious enough to warrant a full investigation.
      14.4.2. Category 2:
         14.4.2.1. Receipt of an enforcement action with a fine between $50,000 and $199,999.
         14.4.2.2. A substance release costing between $50,000 and $199,999 to mitigate (NOTE: cost of
         lost product is not included in mitigation cost).
         14.4.2.3. Release of between 3000 and 10,000 gallons of a petroleum product (The amount of
         release means the total amount released from its original container even if contained within a
         dyke, berm, or other secondary containment system. The amount for reporting purposes may only
         be the amount released to the environment).
         14.4.2.4. A substance release above its regulatory Reportable Quantity (RQ) that threatens to
         damage the public health, safety, or the environment.
         14.4.2.5. A release of between 50,000 and 100,000 gallons of sewage, except in the case of wide-
         spread flooding.
         14.4.2.6. Receipt of two to four enforcement actions from a single inspection.
         14.4.2.7. Receipt of a repeat enforcement action for the same violation.
      14.4.3. Category 3:
         14.4.3.1. Receipt of an enforcement action with a fine between $0 and $49,999.
         14.4.3.2. A substance release costing $49,999 or less to mitigate (NOTE: cost of lost product is
         not included in mitigation cost).
         14.4.3.3. A release of between 25,000 and 50,000 gallons of sewage, except in the case of wide-
         spread flooding.
         14.4.3.4. A substance release above its regulatory Reportable Quantity (RQ) that does not dam-
         age or threaten to damage the public health, safety, or the environment.
      14.4.4. Category 4:
         14.4.4.1. Receipt of an enforcement action without a fine.
         14.4.4.2. Release of between 1000 and 3000 gallons of a petroleum product (The amount of
         release means the total amount released from its original container even if contained within a
         dyke, berm, or other secondary containment system. The amount for reporting purposes may only
         be the amount released to the environment).
         14.4.4.3. A minimum release of 1,000 but less than 25,000 gallons of sewage, except in the case
         of widespread flooding.
         14.4.4.4. Two exceedances of a permit limit (NPDES, Title V, drinking water, etc.) in a quarter (3
         month period) at the same location for the same parameter.
      14.4.5. Enforcement Actions. For the purpose of categorizing an EIIB, ACC/CEVQ will resolve
      any question about whether a regulatory notice is an enforcement action IAW with paragraph 12.3. of
      this manual. For the purpose of the EIIB, ACC/CEVQ will liberally define enforcement action IAW

14.5. Initial Actions:
   14.5.1. Initial Incident Reporting. Upon becoming aware of an environmental incident, immedi-
   ately brief the wing commander. The flight chief, in consultation with JA, will notify regulatory agen-
   cies as required by law. A complete checklist for each category of incident is found in Table 14.1.

Report any delays to HQ ACC/CEVO, DSN 574-9394
Ensure all reports and replies are fully staffedand coordinated.

      14.5.2. For Category 1 incidents, the wing commander notifies HQ ACC/CV by priority message of
      the details as soon as possible, but certainly within 24 hours of occurrence. Notify HQ ACC/CEVQ
      immediately upon release of that message. For all other categories, notify HQ ACC/CEVQ as soon as
      possible, but certainly within the next duty day. (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)8603, Report of Notices of
      Violation and Non-compliance). (NOTE: The "clock" starts when the release is confirmed or when
      the base receives the formal enforcement action. Delay in notifications does not delay suspense's but
      delays for legal clearance do.)

14.6. Investigation Participants.
      14.6.1. Category 1. The ESOH Council chairman appoints a board with HQ ACC/CV concurrence
      within seven days of receiving the wing commander's message. Members of the board are pulled
      from a standing roster of qualified personnel such as, HQ ACC personnel, wing vice commanders,
      environmental flight chiefs, etc. The board will be composed as follows:
         14.6.1.1. A wing vice commander from an unaffected installation - chairman.
         14.6.1.2. A senior command environmental quality manager - technical expertise and liaison
         between ACC and EIIB.
         14.6.1.3. Two environmental flight chiefs from unaffected installations - base level perspective /
         technical expertise
         14.6.1.4. HQ ACC functional experts as needed (must be at least "seven-level," at least MSgt, or
         civilian equivalent).
      14.6.2. Category 2. The wing commander of the affected installation appoints the board within
      seven days of determining incident category with recommendation from his staff. The board will be
      composed as follows:
         14.6.2.1. A group commander (unaffected by the incident).
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                            203


       14.6.2.2. Environmental flight chief (preferably).
       14.6.2.3. Other functional experts as needed to assist the board (if the installation doesn't have
       sufficient expertise, request if from another installation or HQ ACC).
   14.6.3. Category 3. The wing commander of the affected installation appoints an investigating
   officer (IO) within three days of determining incident category. The IO must be a field grade officer,
   hold at least equal rank to the senior individual involved in the incident, and be from an unaffected
   organization. The wing detail office may be able to assist in finding available appropriate individuals.
   14.6.4. Category 4. For Category 4 incidents, HQ ACC/CEVQ will determine whether an investiga-
   tion is required after the wing commander has made the category determination. HQ ACC/CEVQ
   shall use the following factors in its determination: 1) Potential of an investigation to crossfeed useful
   lessons learned; 2) Whether the enforcement action is valid (i.e., whether the regulator may have
   made a mistake), 3) The web based spill report will also be used to determine if an incident merits an
   EIIB. The bias is toward not investigating these types of cases unless one of the factors is present. If
   an investigation is required, it is internal to the environmental flight.
   14.6.5. Personnel serving as board members of IOs must be detailed to the investigation until the
   report is complete. Supervisors of personnel appointed as an IO or board member shall ensure their
   subordinates make the investigation their primary duty until the report is completed. The installation
   environmental flight will naturally be tasked to support the investigation and must support as needed.

14.7. The Investigation.
   14.7.1. Legal Clearance. Obtain written clearance from JA/OSI for all Categories within specified
   timeframe.
       14.7.1.1. The intent of the legal clearance is to: 1) determine whether criminal activity or intent
       was a factor in the incident; and, 2) preserve evidence for potential criminal proceedings.
       14.7.1.2. The EIIB investigation may not proceed until legal clearance is obtained. Special care
       must be taken to safeguard all records for the JA/OSI review. The joint JA/OSI review shall pro-
       ceed immediately after notification and be completed as soon as possible - normally within 24
       hours when there is no indication of criminal activity.
       14.7.1.3. Once the EIIB investigation begins, if at any time the investigators become aware of
       criminal activity related to the incident, the EIIB shall immediately cease so that another legal
       clearance can be obtained.
   14.7.2. The investigation begins three days after: the board is appointed for Categories 1 and 2, the
   IO is appointed for Category 3, and ACC/CEVQ determines the need for an investigation. The inves-
   tigation cannot begin until legal clearance is obtained; thus, a delay in legal clearance will cause a
   delay in beginning the investigation.
   14.7.3. Focus of the Investigation. The board must reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the
   incident and consider all the facts before drawing a conclusion on the causes or contributing factors in
   an environmental incident. The board must also interview all affected personnel especially those
   involved in the incident and those whose training and experience qualify them as experts.
204                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         14.7.3.1. Examine the accident site, if applicable. Use photographs to record actual conditions.
         Photographs have proven invaluable, especially when weather later obscures the site or site condi-
         tions change. Photographs are also helpful during subsequent briefings or report preparation.
         14.7.3.2. Examine all physical evidence and documentation. Environmental incident investiga-
         tions have inherent priorities over other activities and investigators may impound Air Force mate-
         rial and documents relevant to the investigation. Consider personnel safety, securing of hazardous
         materials, and mission essential activities while preserving evidence. Investigators should keep
         evidentiary material only as long as needed to complete the investigation and prepare the report or
         briefing.
      14.7.4. If personnel are brought in to assist the investigation, the wing commander shall fund TDY
      expenses. He shall also fund any laboratory testing that may be required.
      14.7.5. Categories 1 and 2 boards and category 3 IOs have 21 days to complete the incident investi-
      gation and report after the investigation begins. Category 4 IOs have 14 days to complete the investi-
      gation and report after the beginning the investigation.

14.8. The Report.
      14.8.1. All incident reports must be factual and complete. They will include a narrative description
      of the incident, conclusions of the investigating officer or board, and proposed wording for the
      NOTAM. See Attachment 3 for an outline of an EIIB report and Attachment 4 for an example
      NOTAM. Sketches and photographs should be included, as appropriate. Using evidence and profes-
      sional judgment, determine direct root causes, indirect or contributing factors, and the overall environ-
      ment leading to the incident (use EIIB Root Cause Analysis Instructions, Environmental Incident
      Root Causes, and Root Cause Analysis Worksheet found at Attachment 5, Attachment 6, and
      Attachment 7).
      14.8.2. Category 1. The chairman of the board briefs the investigation results to COMACC. The
      affected installation wing commander shall be present for the briefing, as are the HQ ACC/CE and
      other affected directors on the ACC staff. Boards have 14 days to prepare the report and briefing after
      the investigation concludes.
      14.8.3. Category 2. The appointed board prepares the report and submits it through the wing com-
      mander to HQ ACC/CE. Reports must be completed 14 days after the investigation is concluded and
      must arrive at HQ ACC/CE within 7 days of completion.
      14.8.4. Category 3. The investigating officer completes the report within 7 days after the investiga-
      tion is completed. The wing commander forwards the report to HQ ACC/CE within 7 days of its com-
      pletion.
      14.8.5. Category 4. The Environmental flight chief does an internal investigation. In the case of an
      enforcement action, a draft response to the enforcement action and a NOTAM are forwarded to HQ
      ACC/CEVQ within 14 days, or sooner if necessary to respond to the regulator. In all other cases the
      investigation consists of a one page summary report and NOTAM that are forwarded HQ ACC/CEVQ
      within 14 days.
      14.8.6. Incident Closure. Category 1 incidents are closed when COMACC approves the wing com-
      mander's corrective action plan. Category 2 & 3 incidents are closed when affected directorates at HQ
      ACC have reviewed the report and HQ ACC/CV has sent a memorandum to the wing commander
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                              205


  closing the incident. Category 4 incidents close when HQ ACC/CEVQ accepts the report or draft
  response and so informs the environmental flight chief.

                                                Chapter 15

               ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND COMPLIANCE THROUGH
                         POLLUTION PREVENTION FUNDING

15.1. General Requirements. This funding guidance applies to all ACC installations and tenants desir-
ing environmental compliance or pollution prevention funding support.
      15.1.1. Responsibilities.
         15.1.1.1. HQ ACC/CEV is responsible for reviewing and validating ACES-PM environmental
         requirement inputs. Validated ACES-PM inputs are released to HQ USAF/ILEV to support pro-
         gram budgeting and budget development. Base level requirements are prioritized by the head-
         quarters to ensure the most important requirements are funded first. Environmental funds are
         allocated based on environmental non-compliance need and is not a "fair share" program.
         15.1.1.2. Base environmental flights are responsible for identifying environmental regulatory
         project and operations/services (O&S) requirements via ACES-PM (RCS: HAF-CEV(AR)9411).
         These requirements are communicated to HQ ACC/CEV via the ACES-PM system for funding
         support.
             15.1.1.2.1. Bases will submit the following to ACC/CEPD: Front sheet DD Form 1391,
             FY__Military Construction Project Data, for EEIC 522 projects over $450K and less than
             $3M. Full DD Form 1391 packages (DD Form 1391, DD Form 1391c: site plan, data detail
             deficiency sheet, certificate of compliance, detailed cost estimated, and site maps) for EEIC
             522 projects over $3M and for EEIC 529 projects more than $450K. Anticipated RTA dates,
             forecasted project award dates, method of execution, and DD Form 1391 draft and official sta-
             tus must be updated in ACES-PM and maintained current. ACES-PM line items requiring
             design funds must include "AE funds Required" amounts, "Funds Indicator" code D, and
             "Design FY" in the design tab of ACES-PM. Failure to provide accurate, design funds
             request, project RTA and estimated award dates will delay project authorization and funding.
             15.1.1.2.2. Bases will forward Program Objective Memorandum (POM) submissions via the
             ACES-PM system by 1 December of each year or when call letters are issued by the com-
             mand.
      15.1.2. Policy Guidance. The Environmental Compliance (EC) and Compliance through Pollution
      Prevention (CTP2) funding eligibility matrix is available at Attachment 8. This matrix contains a
      detailed summary of the types of requirements, which may be funded using EC and CTP2 funds.
      Funds allocated for specific line items may not be used for other than EC and CTP2 requirements,
      which have not been validated by HQ ACC/CEV.
      15.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
      requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
      provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
      sound engineering and/or environmental practices, which maintain environmental compliance.

15.2. Permits. Permits are typically funded for new construction by the project. Updates, revisions, and
renewals of permits may be funded from the EC or CTP2 accounts where appropriate environmental reg-
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         207


ulations require the permit. Safety, health, and occupational health codes requirements do not qualify for
EC and CTP2 funds. See permit responsibilities and discussion at paragraph 1.5. of this manual.

15.3. Environmental Compliance and Compliance Through Pollution Prevention Funding:
   15.3.1. ACES-PM Module. Enter line item requirements into ACES-PM in accordance with policy
   guidance provided by HQ ACC/CEV electronic mail dated 24 Aug 01 and revised draft 9 Jan 02, to
   ACC/CE Squadron CCs, subject: Policy and Guidance on Use of ACES-PM for Environmental
   Requirements. Copies of this electronic mail are available from HQ ACC/CEVQ or may be down-
   loaded from the ACC/CEVQ web site at: https://ce.acc.af.mil/cev/cevq/requirements.html. At a
   minimum, level 1 line items' narratives (project description) must contain statements for the Require-
   ment and existing condition (for example, "REQR: Storm water outfall #8 may not exceed 9 mg/L; 3
   storm water samples exceeded MCL Jan, Mar, and Jun 02."), Project Description, and Impact. The
   justification block must contain regulatory and applicable permit number citations.
       15.3.1.1. POM Cycle. Submit requirements via the ACES-PM database for submission to the
       DoD Six Future Year Defense Plan (FYDP) by 1 December annually. The POM years may be
       determined by the following formula: Current Fiscal Year + 2 through Current Fiscal Year + 7.
       Items should be coded in ACES-PM as level 1 needs if they are non-recurring and will be out of
       compliance in the year programmed. A typical POM cycle is described in Table 15.1.

       Services (OSM) requirements. For operations and services line items these titles must be used to
       standardize the command's OSM needs in accordance with Air Staff policy. An example OSM
       title should read, "1.1 Training, HW," or "1.4 Supplies, HW."
       15.3.1.3. Civilian Pay. Civilian pay is not distributed through normal O&M channels, but still
       must be programmed in ACES-PM to account for the civilian CTP2 positions throughout the com-
       mand. The standard programming in ACES-PM is for HQ ACC accounting purposes only and
       allows for centralized program management of the EC and CTP2 accounts. HQ ACC/CEV cen-
       trally loads all civilian pay planning numbers in ACES-PM. The amount is for planning purposes
       only and has no effect on actual civilian pay disbursements or budgets.

       15.3.2. Environmental Compliance Program (ECP):
          15.3.2.1. Purpose. The purpose of the ECP is to provide funding for projects/services driven by
          regulatory requirements. Funding environmental programs is important at all levels of the Air
          Force. It is critical for each base to understand funding guidance and build environmental pro-
          grams based on valid requirements. Requirements must be able to withstand close scrutiny during
          Air Force programming and budgeting process reviews. All installation program managers must
          understand and follow this funding guidance. Requirements must be justified by adequate docu-
          mentation, which is auditable, by external agencies. HQ ACC will review base requirements care-
          fully, ensuring supporting documentation is available to verify legitimate environmental
          requirements. There are four environmental accounts-all separate and with different validation
          criteria. The four environmental accounts are: Restoration (ERA), Environmental Compliance
          (EC), Environmental Compliance through Pollution Prevention (CTP2), and Conservation (CN).
          Attachment 8 summarizes the environmental funding eligibility for EC and CTP2.
          15.3.2.2. Charging Environmental Activities to Accounts. This guidance applies to all items
          submitted for environmental compliance funding. Projects in Military Family Housing (MFH),
          non-appropriated funds (NAF) or medical fund accounts are not eligible for O&M environmental
          funds. Environmental items in MFH/NAF/Medical must be accomplished with MFH/NAF/Med-
          ical fund and included in the MFH/NAF/Medical programming and budget process. Environmen-
          tal actions to support MFH/NAF/Medical requirements in connection with repair, renovation,
          demolition or construction are funded by the MFH/NAF/Medical programs, and not environmen-
          tal O&M. There are some variations to this policy. Contact HQ ACC/CEPD for programming
          assistance if needed.
          15.3.2.3. Funding Guidance. Attachment 8 contains specific guidance for determining eligibil-
          ity for using environmental compliance funds. Discussions with environmental compliance pro-
          gram managers are strongly encouraged to develop support for base funding requirements.
          Follow the most current fiscal year execution roadmap memorandum issued by the headquarters.
          15.3.2.4. Recurring Requirements (Operations and Services). EC annual recurring require-
          ments are "must do" services and projects that are necessary to maintain full environmental com-
          pliance. ACC will distribute a standard level of funding to each base for civilian pay and EC
          supplies. Other recurring projects will only be funded to a set limit (Table 15.4.). Each base must

        funding.

           15.3.2.7.1. Definitions of Risk:
               15.3.2.7.1.1. Catastrophic. Required due to an OEA or when damage to the environment
               or personnel occurred or is inevitable. Examples: Aircraft crashes; spills of 10,000 gal-
               lons or more, including sanitary sewer overflows or bypasses due to excessive Infiltration/
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           215


            Inflow (not obstructions); system malfunctions which allows or will allow unacceptable
            contaminate discharge to the environment. A substance release above the regulatory
            Reportable Quantity (RQ) that damages the public health, safety, or the environment.
            Drinking water system which routinely exceeds primary standards or has Total Coliform
            "hits" in 50% or more of special sampling. FOTWs that routinely exceed permit limits.
            Regulatory penalty or fines assessed or high probability of assessment in excess of
            $200,000 or mitigation of a substance release costing more than $200,000.
            15.3.2.7.1.2. Critical. Directly prevents an OEA or is an agreed upon solution between
            the base and regulators in a corrective action plan, permit condition, consent order, or other
            binding legal agreement. Examples: Level 1 projects and ops & svs and mandatory train-
            ing or projects which solve non-compliance problems. Drinking water systems that occa-
            sionally exceed primary standards or has "hits" of Total Coliforms in 25% or more of
            special sampling. Routine exceedances of permit limits at FOTW. Excessive (I/I) to
            POTWs (not FOTWs). Excessive I/I that causes upsets to FOTW or permitted flow
            exceedance at FOTW. Enforcement actions assessed with a fine or potential fine between
            $50,000 and $199,999. A substance release costing between $50,000 and $199,999 to mit-
            igate. Release of at least 1500 gallons but less than 10,000 gallons of a petroleum product,
            including sanitary sewer overflows and/or bypasses due to excessive I/I (not obstructions).
            15.3.2.7.1.3. Essential. Indirectly prevents enforcement actions or responds to a regula-
            tory enforcement action with a fine of $49,999 or less. A substance release costing less
            than $49,999 to mitigate. A release of or potential release of 100 gallons to 1500 gallons
            of a petroleum product or sanitary sewage due to excessive I/I. A substance release above
            the regulatory RQ, but does not damage nor endanger the public health, safety, or the envi-
            ronment.
            15.3.2.7.1.4. Required. An action not appropriate for any risk category listed above, but
            is necessary to maintain compliance or correct non-compliance. Written directive require-
            ments not covered in any category above. Includes receipt of a regulatory enforcement
            action that is outside previous categories.
            15.3.2.7.1.5. Desired. A good business practice or cost effective common sense thing to
            do that saves dollars and protects the environment while supporting the mission.
  15.3.3. Compliance through Pollution Prevention (CTP2) Program:
     15.3.3.1. Purpose. AF policy is to apply cost effective CTP2 projects and activities to correct
     and prevent environmental non-compliance. CTP2 is the preferred approach to compliance and
     best supports the AF goal to reduce environmental and mission support costs.
     15.3.3.2. Recurring Requirements (Operations and Services). CTP2 annual recurring require-
     ments are "must do" services and projects that are necessary to keep the program running. ACC
     will distribute a standard level of funding to each base for civilian pay and CTP2 office supplies.
     Other recurring projects will only be funded to a set limit (Table 15.7.). Each base must determine
     its appropriate needs and program requirements in ACES-PM to receive funding. Recurring
     projects not listed in Table 15.7. will be validated on a case by case basis. Project titles for recur-
     ring items in ACES-PM must match the titles in Table 15.3., Table 15.4., and Table 15.5..

          15.3.3.2.1. CTP2 Office Supplies. The $1K line item is for general office supplies/materials
          supporting the P2 program.
          15.3.3.2.2. Supplies, Hazmart. Approximately $3K will be allocated for Hazmart supplies
          and maintenance. Another $3K is budgeted for implementation and maintenance of computer
          tracking systems whether EMIS or a future DESCIM-approved system. The total for both
          requirements will not exceed $6K.
          15.3.3.2.3. Training/TDY. ACC bases should plan and program for valid CTP2 outreach/
          awareness, EMIS, and EC/CTP2 educational training as well as training TDY costs. This pro-
          grammed amount should reflect projected attendance for all base EC and CTP2 training
          requirements (from all Groups/Squadrons) at approved training courses and should not be
          used for general conference attendance. Exceptions are the AFCEE Joint Service P2 Confer-
          ence and the National Recycling Coalition Conference. (NOTE: ACC funded quotas for the
          annual ACC Environmental Training Symposium should not be projected in this amount. See
          Table 15.3. and Table 15.4., item 1.1 and 3.1, respectively. See footnote to 1.1 training &
          TDY category, Training Others for symposium requirement).
          15.3.3.2.4. Supplies, QRP. Recurring requirements include supplies and equipment mainte-
          nance for qualified recycling programs. These requirements should not exceed $15K annu-
          ally. Large equipment purchases should be programmed as separate non-recurring projects.
          Equipment purchases for single items over $100K do not qualify for EC/CTP2 funds. Annual
          contract costs for recycling should be funded through the solid waste contract or through the
          sale of recyclable materials.
          15.3.3.2.5. Composting Programs. An additional $10K annually for recurring requirements
          for supplies and equipment maintenance for composting may be programmed. Only regula-
          tory required new composting requirements can be supported.
       15.3.3.3. Non-Recurring Requirements. These are services and projects that incur a "one-time
       cost." Except in special circumstances, only Level 1 projects can be supported with funding. The
       funding classes are as follows:
          15.3.3.3.1. Level 1. CTP2 projects can be justified as Level 1 if they solve a compliance
          problem, are included in a permit requirement, close an ECAMP finding, or prevent recurring
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                      217


       compliance violations. Base JA personnel and compliance program managers can help justify
       the funding class of CTP2 projects. Examples of Level 1 justifications for typical P2 projects
       are:
           15.3.3.3.1.1. Aqueous Parts Washer. CAA Title V permit require parts washer by (fill in
           the date).
           15.3.3.3.1.2. Washrack Recycler. Waste water recycler stops unpermitted discharge of
           metals in violation of CWA permit.
           15.3.3.3.1.3. Backflow Prevention Devices. Base water supply system violates SDWA;
           requires backflow prevention devices.
           15.3.3.3.1.4. Vapor Recovery System. Reduces HAPs to prevent violations of NESHAP
           limits.
           15.3.3.3.1.5. Oil Water Separator Elimination. Eliminates recurring discharges of in
           violation of CWA.
       15.3.3.3.2. Level 2. Many P2 projects with a quick payback (less than 5 years) will fall in this
       category.
       15.3.3.3.3. Level 3. These are the traditional goal-driven projects which can be supported
       after all Level 1 and 2 requirements have been met.
    15.3.3.4. Identifying Projects. Examine the findings from the last external and internal ESO-
    HCAMPs. Review the base's last P2 Opportunity Assessment (OA) for valid projects. Review
    ACES-PM line items at other bases.
    15.3.3.5. Justifying Projects. If the project cannot be justified as a valid O&S requirement or as
    a Level 1 project, it will probably not be supported. Prepare will written ACES-PM project text
    narratives to justify the requirement. Input narratives in ACES-PM in the following format: input
    in ACES-PM Description block: requirement, project, impact. If an economic analysis has been
    prepared provide results within the narrative to indicate payback. Insert the regulatory driver in
    the ACES-PM criteria field. Projects are prioritized using the following criteria (the ECERM
    matrix discussed in Table 15.6., may be used for CTP2 items, where appropriate, to assess risk
    and assist headquarters staff in ranking line items):
       15.3.3.5.1. Regulatory Driver. What law drives this project (i.e., CAA, RCRA, CWA)? Will
       it reduce or prevent the base from receiving an enforcement action?
       15.3.3.5.2. Regulatory Agreement. Is there an agreement with the regulator to perform this
       action?
       15.3.3.5.3. Payback. How soon will the project pay for itself? (if applicable).
       15.3.3.5.4. DoD/AF goal. Does it help meet an AF or DoD goal?
    15.3.3.6. Programming Projects. The ACES-PM module is the required mechanism to forward
    requirements and justification to ACC and the Air Staff for validation and funding. Before a Pol-
    lution Prevention project can be validated and funded, it must be submitted in ACES-PM.
       15.3.3.6.1. Suggested Projects. Below are examples of valid CTP2 compliance-driven
       projects and project areas, organized by media. The list is not exhaustive and should not be
       used as the only reference or criteria for the development of valid CTP2 eligible requirements.

      15.3.4. Wedges, Contingencies, and Reserves. Wedges are requests to the budgeting process based
      on ill-founded requirements or at best "guesstimates" to establish a funding requirement without ade-
      quate justification. Wedges, contingencies or reserves cannot be supported by the Environmental
      Compliance and CTP2 pillars. Any wedge submitted will not be validated or supported during the
      funding process. All items submitted during budget exercises (current year unfunded, financial plans,
      POM, etc.) must be based on firm well documented requirements (i.e., a specific regulatory citation
      currently exists necessitating the work).
      15.3.5. Determining Funding Level. The Air Force policy is to fund all level 0 and level 1 require-
      ments annually. Typically, there are insufficient funds to support level 2 and 3 needs. See AFI
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         219


  32-7001, Environmental Budgeting, and DODI 4715.6, Compliance Classes, for a detailed explana-
  tion of levels of funding.
  15.3.6. Cleanup at Closure Bases. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) funds will no longer be
  used to conduct the investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites or areas where hazardous material
  releases have occurred and are likely to remain within retained areas at closing installations that have
  been transferred to ACC. Such environmental restoration activities are to be funded from the Defense
  Environmental Restoration Account (DERA) and managed under the Defense Environmental Resto-
  ration Program. All contaminant plumes originating outside these retained areas are the responsibility
  of Air Force Base Conversion Agencies (AFBCA) (Reference HQ USAF/CEV 16 May 96 Letter,
  Subject, "Joint Distribution of the Example Memorandum of Agreement for the Transition of the
  Environmental Programs Management at Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Bases with Canton-
  ment Areas").
  15.3.7. DESC Funding:
     15.3.7.1. Eligibility. Many Environmental Safety and Occupational Health Compliance and
     Management Program (ESOHCAMP) findings have identified non-compliant situations relative
     to base fuel systems. Most fuel related deficiencies are eligible for Defense Energy Supply Center
     (DESC) funding. The following summary of DESC funding criteria should assist ACC program
     managers in project development. Funding for environmental projects can be obtained from
     DFSC provided the project:
         15.3.7.1.1. Concerns bulk fuels (JP-8) managed by DESC.
         15.3.7.1.2. Involves maintenance and repair work including cathodic protection and second-
         ary containment related to DESC fuel systems.
         15.3.7.1.3. Is required for environmental compliance (EC) such as statutory revision of EC
         documents, sampling of POL emissions and discharges and disposal of POL wastes for DFSC
         managed fuel systems.
         15.3.7.1.4. Consists of spill cleanup (after 1 Oct 92) of DESC fuel systems.
     15.3.7.2. Procedures. The process by which DESC funding is obtained for environmental
     projects requires the coordinated effort of several offices. The following outline of this process is
     provided to explain the basic responsibilities and information flow necessary to successfully exe-
     cute a DFSC project.
         15.3.7.2.1. Maintenance and repair requirements are identified by the base environmental, liq-
         uid fuels maintenance or base fuels management flights. The requirements should then be pro-
         grammed by developing a one page DD Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data,
         including a detailed cost estimate and detailed description of the work, including information
         containing the specific compliance issue and the applicable regulatory citation. A one-page
         site plan must be attached.
         15.3.7.2.2. Once the DD Form 1391 is developed and a project number is assigned the project
         should be forwarded through normal programming channels to HQ ACC/CEPD in conjunc-
         tion with the program call. If the requirement is valid and the documentation is correct, HQ
         ACC/CEPD will work with ACC/CEO to develop the Command program for submittal to
         DESC for approval.
220                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


             15.3.7.2.3. After the project is approved by DESC, the base may request funding for design of
             the project. This request should be addressed to ACC/CEO and contain the design start, award
             date and completion dates, name and address of the base point of contact for the Military Inter-
             departmental Purchase Request (MIPR).
             15.3.7.2.4. Once the design is complete, the base may request construction funds. This
             request should be addressed to ACC/CEO and contain the construction start and completion
             dates, a revised DD Form 1391, 100% plans and specifications, name and address of the base
             point of contact for the MIPR.
             15.3.7.2.5. ESOHCAMP findings that are DESC eligible projects must be submitted in the
             above manner. The ESOHCAMP corrective action plan (CAP) must include a valid base
             project number to be acceptable.
             15.3.7.2.6. Call letters for DESC projects are sent to ACC bases 1 year prior to the program
             year and are typically due in October. For example, the due date for the FY03 DESC project
             program was due to ACC/CEO Oct 01.
         15.3.7.3. DLA MILCON. If a requirement is classified as construction and is over $750,000, it
         will be referred to HQ ACC/CEPD to be worked as a Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Military
         Construction (MILCON) project. This can only happen when the base submits the appropriate
         paperwork.
         15.3.7.4. Funding DESC Spill Cleanup. Spills should be handled at the base as an emergency
         situation (See Chapter 11, Spill Management, on reporting on other responsibilities). This means
         the base should not wait for funding from DESC before committing funds to begin responding to
         a release. DESC will "reimburse" the base for funds used in spill response/cleanup as long as
         proper documentation is provided and the spill did not result from gross operator negligence.
         Immediately notify ACC/CEO detailing the intention to request DESC funding for the spill
         cleanup. Requests for funds must be timely to gain "reimbursement" from DESC.
             15.3.7.4.1. Documentation needed for spill response and cleanup funds include the following:
             situation report or incident report and projected schedule of out-year funding costs.
             15.3.7.4.2. The following items should be included on a DD Form 1391 and submitted to
             ACC/CEO, with a copy to HQ ACC/CEPD, when funds are requested:
                 15.3.7.4.2.1. Breakdown of all costs associated with the response/cleanup efforts.
                 15.3.7.4.2.2. Copy of proposed cleanup actions and projected funding levels needed to
                 complete cleanup include itemized breakdown of costs.
      15.3.8. Host and Tenant Funding for Environmental Activities. Interservice Support Agreements
      (ISA) delineate the responsibilities of receivers (tenants) and suppliers (host Bases) at ACC installa-
      tions. Environmental clauses must be included to clearly guide tenants as to what their obligations are
      in regard to the environment. Pending Air Force Instructions, the policy is established by SAF/MII's
      6 Feb 98 letter, "Environmental Provisions for Interservice Support Agreements". This policy is
      applicable to all ACC installations. Fines and penalties for which tenants are determined to be respon-
      sible are reimbursable to the host base or command.
      15.3.9. Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) Activity Environmental Funding. Funding for NAF
      activities (e.g., AAFES gas station) environmental compliance follows Air Force policy contained in
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                             221


   AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated
   Fund Instrumentalities, and AFI 32-1022, Planning and Programming NAF Facility Construction
   Projects. The Air Force has authorized the use of appropriated funds for environmental liability/
   cleanup, maintenance and repair, and repair by replacement to support AAFES USTs installed after 30
   Sep 88. AAFES nonappropriated funds are required for permit fees and monitoring devices (REF:
   ACC/CE memorandum, 20 Jul 01, Subject: Air Force Funding Policy Change for Army and Air
   Force Exchange Service Station Underground Storage Tanks).
       15.3.9.1. NAF funds leak detection monitoring devices, and specialized permits for operations
       after 30 Sep 88, disposal of hazardous materials chemicals, paints, etc., pumps waste hold tanks,
       spills during transfer or delivery. NAF also funds UST and AST maintenance, repair, repair by
       replacement, distribution lines to pumps, pumps and dispensing lines, waste analysis, cleanup and
       disposal for tanks installed after 30 Sep 88. For tanks existing on 30 Sep 88 NAF funds pumps
       and dispensing lines.
       15.3.9.2. Appropriated Funds (APF) funds comprehensive base-wide permits, environmental
       deficiencies caused by act of God or fire, environmental deficiencies from operations prior to 1Oct
       88. In accordance with SAF/FMCEB Message 060943ZJUN 00, appropriated funds are autho-
       rized to support AAFES underground storage tanks installed after 30 Sep 88 for environmental lia-
       bility/cleanup, repair and maintenance and repair by replacement. Registering and acquiring
       permits is a responsibility of the Host Installation. Registration and permit costs are reimbursed
       by Non-Appropriated Funds. Appropriated funds are also authorized for maintenance, repair, and
       replacement of tanks, distribution lines to pumps, pumps and dispensing lines of utility systems
       for real property facilities under BCE control, removal of asbestos, removal of hazardous
       lead-based paint, and UST and AST maintenance, repair, repair by replacement, distribution lines
       to pumps, waste analysis, cleanup and disposal for tanks existing on 30 Sep 88.
       15.3.9.3. AAFES. HQ USAF/ILE 20 Apr 01 memorandum, subject, Air Force Funding Policy
       Change for Army and Air Force Exchange Service Station Underground Storage Tanks (USTs)
       (SAF/FMCED Message, 6 Jun 00) states, "Appropriated funds are authorized for environmental
       liability/cleanup, repair and maintenance, and repair by replacement of USTs. AAFES nonappro-
       priated funds (NAFs) are responsible for monitoring devices and permitting tanks (including
       waste oil). This includes all costs associated with permits, registration, air permits etc. The host
       installation is responsible for obtaining and administering registration and permits. Base program
       managers should seek HQ ACC/CEV assistance where amicable solutions and payments cannot
       be resolved at the installation level.

15.4. Indoor Air Quality (Sick Building Syndrome). Indoor air quality is regulated primarily through
OSHA and/or health regulations. The Base Civil Engineer is responsible for correcting facility related air
quality issues such as reworking HVAC systems or controlling the use of building systems that impact
indoor air quality. Environmental Compliance (EC) funds can be used for indoor air quality problems
related to Radon. Other indoor air quality problems due to insufficient air turn over, mold in ducts, carpet
emissions, and second hand smoke or smoke entrainment are not EC eligible.

15.5. Compliance Site Inventory. The Compliance Site inventory program is an initiative to reduce the
environmental burden on the wing mission through pollution prevention. Compliance Site Inventories
will be used to evaluate and prioritize the sites by burden level, where "burden" is a factor of both the risk
of enforcement action and the resources necessary (money and manpower) to keep the site in compliance.
222                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


By conducting opportunity assessments on the highest burdened sites pollution prevention solutions can
be identified, programmed and justified.
      15.5.1. The USAF/ILEV CSI Implementation Guidance defines a compliance site as any regulated
      facility, process, or discharge to a regulated facility or process. This includes any discrete location
      under Air Force control wherein activity occurs that is subject to current or known future (resulting in
      known consequences) federal, state, and local statutes and regulations; Executive Orders; DoD and
      Air Force policies; and Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD), Final Gov-
      erning Standards (FGS), and international agreements.
      15.5.2. ACC/CEVQ has expanded this definition to include environmental documents/records which
      are subject to regulation and enforcement, such as the SPCC plan and Oil/Water Separator reports.
      Implementation guidance also states compliance sites associated with programmed compliance (EC/
      P2) projects and MILCON program submittals are to be incorporated into the consolidated inventory
      of compliance sites. For example, a facility project includes a new boiler, the boiler is a compliance
      site and must included in the base's inventory. Note that a single process may generate several com-
      pliance sites. For example, an industrial process may generate air pollutants, wastewater, and hazard-
      ous wastes. Each point of discharge would be considered a separate compliance site. In addition,
      multiple compliance sites may discharge into another compliance site. An example of this is an accu-
      mulation point in which multiple hazardous waste generation compliance sites terminate.
      15.5.3. The Compliance Site Inventory database will be fully compatible with GEOBASE.

15.6. Payments to Regulatory Agencies for Document Reviews. Federal facilities are liable for fees
under the RCRA or state hazardous waste program. The authority for paying fees comes from Congres-
sional language in section 6001 (42 USC Section 6961) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (which amended
RCRA) waiving sovereign immunity for fees. In addition, the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992,
which waived sovereign immunity for paying of fines and penalties under RCRA, also restated the
responsibility of federal facilities to pay RCRA fees. That language stated that "reasonable service
charges" include but are not limited to fees or charges assessed in connection with the processing and
issuance of permits, renewal of permits, amendments to permits, review of plans, studies, and other docu-
ments, and inspection and monitoring of facilities, as well as any other nondiscriminatory charges that are
assessed in connection with a Federal, State, interstate, or local solid waste or hazardous waste regulatory
program. Finally, a SAF/MIQ Policy Letter, "Environmental Fee/Tax Policy", dated 17 November 1989,
states that an environmental fee will be presumed to be valid (constitutional) on its face unless some obvi-
ous provision of the fee is cause for questioning the underlying basis for the fee. The fee can be chal-
lenged if it is discriminatory toward the federal government, or if the fee does not in some way benefit the
installation. For example, if the environmental fee collection can be used only to upgrade state prisons,
there is no benefit to the installation. In general, fees go into general treasuries and benefit the installation
in some way. Any challenge to a fee must be processed through the MAJCOM and Regional Counsel's
office.

15.7. Vehicle Authorizations Policy. Authorizations for new vehicles are regulated by AFI 24-301,
Vehicle Operations. An organization must have a Basis of Issue (BOI) and authorization to have a vehicle.
If a BOI does not exist a request to establish one is sent to HQ ACC/LGT to request one. The justification
must address how the vehicles will support CEV activities and responsibilities such as hazardous waste
management, recycling, or hazardous material management and be compelling. The squadron vehicle
NCO will complete an ACC Form 116 and obtain all required local base coordination, including the base
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                       223


transportation office, then submit the request to ACC/LGT. The ACC civil engineering point of contact is
HQ ACC/CEOO, DSN 574-2272. Bottom line: do not purchase or obtain a vehicle without authorization
and approval to do so by HQ ACC/LGT and your wing transportation squadron.
224                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006

          project validation/funding from HQ ACC and submits a draft statement of work to the ECAS
          Program Manager. After evaluation and contractor selection, the ECAS PM will assist the
          base in developing the task order "package" (SOW, Cost Estimate, Contractor-selection justi-
          fication letter, funding document) for submission to base's contracting activity. The TPM will
          perform technical review of contractor's proposal and provide written comments to the CA.
          The TPM will participate in the negotiation as the technical representative. The TPM will pro-
          vide technical oversight during project execution and provide the contracting officer with
          feedback on performance throughout the project. The TPM will validate contractor's monthly
          invoices, against the payment monitoring plan, so contracting activity can authorize payment.
          At project completion, the TPM will complete the performance evaluation (A-E), provided by
          the contracting.
   16.1.2. Policy Guidance. Not applicable.
   16.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Not applicable.
   16.1.4. Applicability. The use of the ECAS contracting system is available to ACC installations and
   to other Air Force/DoD agencies through the use of Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs). ACC/
   CEV encourages the use of ECAS where it may prove cost effective or serve as a best management
   alternative to the various environmental contracting methods and agencies available.

16.2. ECAS Contract Description.
   16.2.1. Contract Scope. Environmental Programs Division, Quality Branch (HQ ACC/CEVQ)
   through the ACC Contracting Squadron (ACC CONS) awarded Architectural and Engineering (A&E)
   contracts to provide various environmental services. The scope of the contracts is for study and
   design type services and not construction or environmental cleanup action. Covered services include
   the following areas:
      16.2.1.1. Environmental compliance.
      16.2.1.2. Pollution prevention.
      16.2.1.3. Environmental restoration (study/investigation phases only).
      16.2.1.4. Environmental Engineering study and design services.
      16.2.1.5. Environmental training, outreach, seminars.
      16.2.1.6. Other environmental services.
   16.2.2. Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract. ECAS is an Indefinite Delivery/
   Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. An IDIQ contract is used when the exact times and/or quantities
   of future deliveries are not known at the time of contract award. The majority of task orders will be
   firm-fixed price but ECAS will have the flexibility to execute time-and-material task orders, when
   needed.
   16.2.3. Program Management. The ECAS program is structured to allow for both centralized (HQ
   ACC managed) and decentralized (base level managed) award and execution of task orders. Central-
   ized orders will be issued and administered through ACC CONS, and decentralized orders will be
   issued and administered through the requesting organization's base contracting activity, or through
   ACC CONS (in emergencies).

16.3. Task Order Process. The chronological order of events for generation and completion of each task
order is as follows (all times are based on average workload conditions and can be compressed for priority
processing):
      16.3.1. Technical project manager (TPM) obtains project validation/funding approval.
      16.3.2. TPM submits statement of work (SOW) to ECAS PM.
      16.3.3. The ECAS PM reviews SOW, develops source selection justification letter (with input from
      the TPM); 2-3 days.
      16.3.4. ECAS PM (centralized) or TPM (decentralized) develops task order (TO) package and sub-
      mits to CA. ECAS program management personnel can assist bases with the SOW and cost estimates;
      5 days.
      16.3.5. CA reviews TO package and provides comments (if applicable) to ECAS PM or TPM; 2-5
      days.
      16.3.6. Contracting Officer issues request for proposal (RFP) to contractor.
      16.3.7. TPM (with ECAS PM if appropriate) reviews proposal/submits technical review comments to
      CA. 2-5 days.
      16.3.8. Optional. CA arranges a fact-finding session with contractor when appropriate (i.e., when
      clarification or areas of concern need to be addressed prior to negotiation).
      16.3.9. CA prepares pre-negotiation objective (when applicable); 1-2 days.
      16.3.10. CA, with assistance from TPM, negotiate TO with contractor; 1 day.
      16.3.11. CA awards task order.
      16.3.12. During project execution, TPM monitors contractor performance/recommends approval of
      work complete on monthly invoices.
      16.3.13. TPM reviews all submittals and provides written comments via the CA to the contractor.
      16.3.14. CA provides performance evaluation form to TPM upon project completion.
      16.3.15. TPM completes and returns performance evaluation form to CA and provides a copy to
      ECAS PM; 5 Days.

16.4. Project Development/ Information Source.
      16.4.1. The ECAS Information Management System (IMS). HQ ACC/CEVQ provided each base
      CEV with an electronic version of the ECAS (IMS) to assist project managers with developing their
      task order packages The ECAS IMS contains a statement of work library, cost estimating spreadsheets
      for each ECAS contractor (in MS Excel format), ECAS statement of work format, task order transmit-
      tal letter/ECAS checklist templates, ECAS technical reference literature such as ECAS Desktop
      Guide, Desktop Guide for Technical Evaluations, 1996 Environmental Symposium papers entitled
      "Environmental Compliance and Analysis Services Contract"(page 65); "Writing Environmental
      Statements of Work/Preparing Government Cost Estimates" (page 83).
      16.4.2. The ECAS Website. An internet website totally dedicated to the ECAS program can be
      found at the following address: http://www2.acc.af.mil/lg/Cons/lgce/ecas.htm. This site contains
      the ECAS contracts, POCs within ACC CONS, ECAS Program Office, and each contractor, a back-

      ground paper on preparing SOWs, cost-estimating spreadsheets, a list of non-ACC organizations that
      have memoranda of agreement to use ECAS, the ECAS IMS, ECAS training briefings, and other rel-
      evant documents to facilitate ECAS use. The site is routinely updated to provide the most current
      information and to reflect changes in personnel.
      16.4.3. ECAS TO Package. The TPM identifies the requirement, loads into ACES-PM and obtains
      project validation from HQ ACC/CEVQM. The TPM then generates AF Form 9 (funding) upon
      receipt of funding advice from HQ ACC, and generates a task order package to include the following:
         16.4.3.1. Statement of Work (SOW). (Check with ACC to see if similar SOW is available).
         16.4.3.2. Payment monitoring plan and deliverables schedule (which are attachments in the
         SOW).
         16.4.3.3. Government cost estimate.
         16.4.3.4. Contractor selection justification letter (provided by ECAS PM).
         16.4.3.5. AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, or equivalent (signed by finance office).
      16.4.4. Additional Information. Further information on ECAS is available in each Environmental
      Training Symposium annual proceedings.

16.5. ECAS SOW Format. HQ Air Combat Command developed the following SOW template to assist
in developing SOWs (Table 16.1.):

                                             Chapter 17

                                    MILCON PROGRAMMING

17.1. General Requirements. The purpose of this chapter is to provide instruction and guidance for
those responsible for planning, programming, and executing cost-effective environmental military con-
struction (MILCON), which is $750,000 or more. MILCON can also include environmental repair
projects costing $300,000 or more, however these are typically funded through the O&M appropriations.
Repair projects that exceed $3,000,000 should be reviewed for potential inclusion in the MILCON pro-
gram.
   17.1.1. Responsibilities:
       17.1.1.1. Base Environmental Flight. The Base CEV is the leader to generate and ensure items
       qualify as environmental requirements. This may be accomplished, in part, programming ESOH
       CAMP corrective actions, by monitoring notices of violation (NOVs) relevant to an Air Force
       installation, reviewing environmental compliance evaluations/studies which identify non-compli-
       ance conditions, obtaining enforcement trends from the AF Regional Environmental Offices
       (REO), and by staying abreast of regulatory developments in general. Base CEVs also have pri-
       mary responsibility for researching and insuring the necessary environmental permits are obtained
       for all MILCON projects. In addition, Base CEVs are responsible to ensure the environmental
       impact analysis process (EIAP) for current mission and environmental MILCON projects is com-
       pleted along with preparation of the Certificates of Compliance (See AFI 32-1021, Planning and
       Programming of Military Construction Projects). Base CEVs work closely with design and con-
       struction engineers to ensure the MILCON project is designed and constructed to correct the
       non-compliance condition the project was approved to fix.
       17.1.1.2. Base Engineering Flight. The Base CEE is responsible for preparing all required DD
       Form 1391, MILCON Project Data, and submitting that information to the command. Since the
       DD Form 1391 MILCON package is submitted through base engineering it is imperative base
       environmental flights participate in the preparation of the draft text of the DD Form1391.
       17.1.1.3. Command Environmental Programs Division:
          17.1.1.3.1. HQ ACC/CEVQM: Media Section. Individual media program managers validate
          MILCON environmental non-compliance requirements, work closely with base counterparts
          to define scope, document non-compliance and assist in obtaining the necessary approvals for
          MILCON. The Command Environmental Programmer works with the Command Program
          Development Branch (HQ ACC/CEPD) responsible for MILCON to assemble DD Form 1391
          documentation.
       17.1.1.4. Command Engineering (MILCON Project Manager):
          17.1.1.4.1. The MILCON project manager is responsible to oversee design and construction
          of all command MILCON projects including those that deal with environmental compliance.
          HQ ACC/CEVQ media program managers and HQ ACC/CEVQM environmental program-
          mer work closely with this individual all through the design/construction effort.
       17.1.1.5. Air Staff (HQ USAF/ILEV) Environmental Programs. The air staff media program
       manager reviews and validates the environmental MILCON submittal from MAJCOMs. For an
230                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         environmental MILCON project to be validated by Air Staff as a valid environmental Class 1
         requirement it must meet the following criteria:
             17.1.1.5.1. The project effort must meet the standard criteria for all MILCON projects. Please
             consult AFI 32-1021.
             17.1.1.5.2. The project must remedy a valid, Class 1, non-compliant environmental regulatory
             condition. See AFI 32-7001, Environmental Budgeting, for a definition of 'Level 1 (now Class
             1)'. Validation is ultimately determined by media program managers in HQ USAF/ILEVQ.
             Proposed projects are presented to HQ USAF/ILEVQ by HQ ACC/CEVQ.
             17.1.1.5.3. The project must be classified as construction per AFI 32-1032, Planning and Pro-
             gramming Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects, and AFI
             32-1021.
      17.1.2. Policy Guidance. Applicable Air Force guidance for military construction (MILCON) pro-
      gramming is found in AFI 32-1021. This document provide instructions and procedures on how to
      prepare and plan military construction projects plus develop documentation.
      17.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
      requested through HQ ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and
      provide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
      sound engineering and/or environmental practices that maintain environmental compliance.
      17.1.4. Applicability. The Air Force MILCON program is applicable to all ACC installations.

17.2. Permits. Environmental permits necessary for any MILCON must be obtained as required by envi-
ronmental regulations in the state where construction occurs. Some permits, like Prevention of Signifi-
cant Deterioration (PSD) air quality permits can take 18 months to 2 years to complete. Environmental
MILCON project planners and managers must begin early to work with installation environmental flight
personnel and others to identify all permit requirements to avoid project delays. The environmental flight
negotiates or oversees the contractor who negotiates, for the Air Force, with environmental regulatory
agencies to obtain MILCON permits. Permits are typically an installation commander responsibility,
which may not be delegated to contractors performing military construction. Ensure appropriate level Air
Force management is the approval authority for permits obtained for the installation. MILCON permits
are funded as part of the total project costs (See AFI 32-1021, paragraph 2.1.9.2. Permits).

17.3. Description of the MILCON Process.
      17.3.1. The MILCON program is one budget item in a perpetual, long-range, forward-looking, cycli-
      cal activity called the Biennial Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (BPPBS). Every two
      years the command submits a list of projects, categorized by fiscal year, for accomplishment over the
      next six years. This list becomes, ultimately, part of the future years defense plan (FYDP) and is sub-
      mitted as the budget estimate submission (BES) to USAF, DOD and the U.S. Congress for their con-
      sideration and eventual acceptance into the MILCON program. Every odd year the program is
      updated in the amended budget estimate submission (ABES). As each program year approaches and
      the project list becomes firm there has already been a year or more of planning effort preparing for the
      execution of these projects.
      17.3.2. Determining a Qualifying Project Requirement. If a project is programmed to correct a
      non-compliant condition related to a NOV this may be considered a valid Class 1 EC MILCON
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                            231


   project. Environmental evaluation/studies and ESOH CAMP findings may be used to identify and
   further investigate non-compliance areas. Examples include inflow and infiltration investigations of
   sanitary sewers, evaluation of drinking water systems, air pollutant emissions inventories, and others.
   A project programmed in response to documented non-compliance and of sufficient scope may qual-
   ify as a valid Class 1 EC MILCON project.
      17.3.2.1. USAF Guidebook for Environmental Compliance POM (Program Objective Mem-
      orandum) Models. This guidebook sent to ACC installation Feb 96, prepared for the Air Force
      by Resource Applications Inc., provides guidance on the various media areas to aid in determining
      qualifying project requirements (HQ USAF/CEV Ltr, Subj: Environmental Compliance POM
      Handbook and Computerized Cost Models, 11 Jan 96). The guidebook contains a series of
      "if-then" matrices which offer an excellent path to follow when considering media areas to inves-
      tigate.
   17.3.3. Budgeting for Project Requirements. The USAF Guidebook for Environmental Compli-
   ance POM Models includes a good computer program to aid in developing costs estimates for envi-
   ronmental compliance projects. It can be used for both ECP and MILCON scale projects. The
   program aids in generating project costs using information provided by the programmer. The result-
   ing cost information is useful in preparing an annual budget as well as individual project estimates. It
   is particularly useful in that the format is identical to that used in the Block 9, Cost Estimates section
   of the DD1391.
   17.3.4. Submitting a Project:
      17.3.4.1. An environmental MILCON project may be submitted to the Command at any time.
      Projects submitted will be placed in the collective ACC environmental MILCON program.
      Projects are prioritized based upon Class, need, funds availability, etc. Projects that qualify will be
      submitted to Air Force during the biennial call for MILCON requirements. Submission to Air
      Force occurs in every even numbered year. Input projects into the ACES-PM database.
      17.3.4.2. All projects submitted for inclusion in the ACC FYDP must be accompanied by the fol-
      lowing:
          17.3.4.2.1. DD Form 1391.
          17.3.4.2.2. DD Form 1391c, Certificate of Compliance (See AFI 32-1021 for specifics).
          17.3.4.2.3. Environmental Study/Analysis. The environmental analysis fully documents the
          non-compliance the project will correct. Be sure to provide specific and conclusive evidence
          that a non-compliant situation exists.
          17.3.4.2.4. Parametric Cost Estimate from the Guidebook for Environmental Compliance
          POM Models or other USAF accepted estimating method.
      17.3.4.3. The above documentation must be received by the headquarters no later than the end of
      January in every even numbered year for the BES.

17.4. MILCON Environmental Related Topics.
   17.4.1. Environmental Hazards in the way of Military Construction. Military Construction
   Appropriation Bill, 2001, 106th Congress, 2d Session, P.L. 106-290, states remediation, "such as
   asbestos removal, radon abatement, lead-based paint removal or abatement, and any other legislated
232                                 ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


      environmental hazard remediation may be excluded, provided that such remediation requirements
      could not be reasonably anticipated at the time of budget submission." This same language has been
      in previous appropriations bills at least beginning with FY 1998.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                           233


                                               Chapter 18

                               POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM

18.1. General Requirements. Pollution Prevention (P2) is proactive and aggressive management of
Environmental Compliance. Industry has found that P2 initiatives make good business sense because
they reduce the cost of doing business, decrease future liabilities, improve performance and reduce com-
pliance burden. P2 solutions use processes, practices, materials, or products that avoid or reduce pollution
and may include source reduction through process changes or material substitution, reuse, or recycling.
Everyone has a stake in P2 success and ultimately in environmental compliance. This chapter outlines
ACC P2 policy as it relates to hazardous material and waste management, volatile organic compound
(VOC) reduction, ozone depleting substance (ODS) reduction, and municipal solid wastemanagement.
This chapter also establishes the framework for management and implementation of a P2 Program within
ACC.
   18.1.1. Responsibilities:
       18.1.1.1. The ACC Pollution Prevention section (ACC/CEVQP) is responsible for policy devel-
       opment, guidance and resource allocation for the program.
       18.1.1.2. Base level pollution prevention managers are responsible for effective implementation
       and execution of the installation level P2 program. This includes the timely reporting of quarterly
       P2 metrics through ESORTS (Environmental Status of Resources and Training System) and iden-
       tification of the 5-year P2 installation budget.
       18.1.1.3. Management Action Plan (MAP). Each ACC installation, including those outside the
       US, will have a Pollution Prevention Management Action Plan (MAP). The MAP is the single
       reference used to manage the development and execution of an installation's P2 program. The
       MAP is based on recurring opportunity assessments to continually evaluate an installation's suc-
       cess in achieving pollution prevention goals. Organizational responsibilities will be clearly delin-
       eated in the P2 MAP. The "U.S. Air Force Installation Pollution Prevention Program Guide and
       Prototype Pollution Prevention Management Action Plan" dated August 1995, provides detailed
       guidance for developing an installation P2 MAP.
       18.1.1.4. P2 Working Group. Effective implementation of a P2 Management Action Plan
       (MAP) at the base level will require a coordinated effort. An active Environmental, Safety, and
       Occupational Health Protection Committee (ESOH PC) will need the support of a strong P2
       Working Group or Subcommittee to run an effective program. Responsibilities of the P2 Working
       Group are as follows (Table 18.1.):

Table 18.1. P2 Working Group Responsibilities.
        Develop overall installation program goals (supplement to ACC goals)
        Prioritize the waste stream, processes, or facility areas for assessment
        Select pollution prevention and Opportunity Assessment teams
        Provide training for assessment teams
        Establish criteria for selecting options for implementation
234                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


          Conduct (or supervise) assessments
          Conduct (or monitor) technical/economic feasibility analyses of favorable options
          Select options for implementation - obtain EPC approval
          Program and advocate funding
          Monitor (and/or direct) implementation progress
          Monitor performance of new option(s), once operational
          Monitor overall progress toward achieving the installation's P2 goals/objectives
          Analyze P2 Metric Data

         18.1.1.5. P2 Teams. P2 Teams are typical components of the P2 Subcommittee, which focus on
         achieving specific goals, such as the hazardous waste reduction or affirmative procurement goals.
         Teams should be made up of five to seven shop chiefs and mid-level managers normally represent-
         ing the CE/SG/LG/OG communities. The teams will report to the P2 Working Group on progress,
         initiatives, problems encountered, and other requirements. This step is crucial to P2's success,
         since the working group cannot efficiently discuss, track, and implement initiatives to meet all the
         goals of the program. Responsibilities of the P2 Teams are as follows (Table 18.2.):

Table 18.2. P2 Team Responsibilities.
          Recommend ways to implement ACC policies
          Ensure accurate baseline calculations
          Identify pollution prevention goal requirements
          Classify options generated by assessments
          Generate recommended solutions
          Select options for implementation
          Establish "Program" data for MAP (Project Narrative, Cost, ROI, Benefit, OPR)
          Establish "Execution" data for MAP (Identify implementation steps, ECDs, OPRs)
          Identify funding requirements and mechanisms
          Document (and/or direct) implementation progress
          Document overall progress toward achieving the program area's P2 goals/objectives

      18.1.2. Policy Guidance:
         18.1.2.1. Applicable AF guidance is found in AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Program, AFI
         32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, and AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Com-
         pliance. Federal policy includes EO 12843, 12856, 12902, 12964, and 13101, and various letters
         from Air Staff.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                            235


      18.1.2.2. Pollution prevention is ACC's preferred choice for achieving compliance with environ-
      mental laws and regulations, Executive Orders (EO), and DoD and Air Force policies. The Air
      Combat Command P2 program emphasizes the reduction and recycling of ozone depleting sub-
      stances (ODSs), hazardous/industrial waste, municipal solid waste; and management and control
      of hazardous materials. Particular attention to the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) chemicals, vol-
      atile air emissions, pesticides management, affirmative procurement, and energy and water con-
      servation are required to maintain an effective ACC program. The ACC base environmental flight
      achieves this successful emphasis by identifying P2 requirements through opportunity assess-
      ments, justifying those requirements in the ACES-PM, swiftly executing projects, accurately mea-
      suring program status (QPMs), and promoting P2 awareness among all base personnel.
      18.1.2.3. ACC policy is to achieve compliance through pollution prevention. One should prevent
      pollution at the source whenever possible through source reduction (e.g., using a jet washer rather
      than a solvent), then through recycling or reuse (e.g., solvent still), and use disposal only as a last
      resort. This hierarchy of actions must be fully integrated into the day-to-day operations through-
      out your base. This requires a cross-functional, coordinated effort, and makes P2 education and
      training essential for all base personnel. Also, the key to a successful P2 program is good relation-
      ships and partnerships between your base and Federal, State, and local regulators, and other public
      or private stakeholders.
      18.1.2.4. Installation pollution prevention managers are referred to the 5 Dec 96 ACC Pollution
      Prevention Manager's Library. This notebook library contains all Public Laws, executive orders,
      Air Force Instructions and Policy Directives, ACC memoranda and miscellaneous guidance perti-
      nent to the management of the ACC P2 program. Please also refer to the following Memoranda
      and Executive Order:

   18.1.3. Waivers to Policy. Requests for waivers to the policies contained in this chapter may be
   requested through ACC/CEV. Requesting agencies should summarize the areas of concern and pro-
   vide adequate explanation for the reason of the waiver request. The justification must be based on
   sound engineering and/or environmental practices that maintain environmental compliance.
   18.1.4. Applicability. This guidance applies to all ACC installations, including tenant organizations,
   ANG, and AFRES units located on ACC installations under the operational control of the wing com-
   mander. Units on non-ACC installations may apply this guidance, after making appropriate coordina-
   tion with the host installation.

18.2. P2 Program Goals.
   18.2.1. Air Force P2 Goals. The Air Force has established the following P2 goals (Table 18.3.):

18.3. Opportunity Assessments (OAs).
      18.3.1. OA Purpose. An OA is a process to help identify ways to eliminate or reduce compliance
      sites. They are also required on a recurring basis by AFI 32-7080 and should be done by base level
      personnel.
      18.3.2. OA Methodology. The process of conducting an OA is found in the draft AFI 32-7080. The
      draft AFI 32-7080 is currently under revision.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         237


      18.3.2.1. Identify the major compliance site burdens on base and focus OA efforts on these items
      first.
   18.3.3. Technology Needs:
      18.3.3.1. Technology Master Process (TMP) Hazardous Material Reduction Prioritization
      Process (HMRPP). The HMRPP is a tool to identify, validate, assess, and program P2 initiatives
      for weapon systems and maintenance processes. It replaces the need for EPA-17 and HM weapon
      system metrics. Rather than report large volumes of HM usage data every quarter, the HMRPP is
      the means for your base to identify requirements that will have the greatest potential for pollution
      prevention and/or hazardous material reduction in weapon systems. The idea is to give you the
      capability to develop requirements. The HMRPP also provides for an installation impact assess-
      ment. Impact assessments are based on environmental performance, payback, cost avoidance,
      resource investment, mission enhancement, O&M savings, public outreach, and life-cycle costs.
      Considering the high-cost of weapon system modifications, final approval and attainment of all
      needs will be based on maximizing the return on investment for the AF. Once a need is tied to a
      weapon system or maintenance process that is mandated by a TO, it will be forwarded to HQ
      AFMC to identify potential solutions or R&D requirements.

18.4. P2 Program Components.
   18.4.1. Hazardous Material:
      18.4.1.1. Goal. Each year, base level personnel will be responsible for determining the base's
      goals and developing plans to achieve those goals. The ACC Environmental Quality Business
      Plan includes the MAJCOM's goal of reducing hazardous material turned in as hazardous waste.
      18.4.1.2. Tracking and Reporting. The installation's Pollution Prevention Working Group in
      conjunction with all sources of supply (SOS) will track the hazardous material identified by EMIS
      and make the information available to the HMMP team upon request.
      18.4.1.3. HMMP Team. The HMMP Team manages the acquisition of hazardous materials
      (HM) to support Air Force missions, while minimizing the use and reliance of HM. The
      cross-functional team will oversee the HAZMART, HMRPP, and the ODS Management Program.
      HMMP teams will meet at least quarterly and minutes will be kept. The purpose, scope, execu-
      tion, and team composition are given in AFI 32-7086.
      18.4.1.4. HAZMART. The HAZMART will be run as a partially decentralized operation. The
      HAZMART offers a single point of contact for base customers and provides centralized control
      for HM transactions. The HAZMART enters all receipt, issue, turn-in, reissue, release, and dis-
      posal transactions, allocated at the HAZMART, into EMIS. Every ACC base has a functioning
      HAZMART and all applicable SOS using HM will be enrolled in the HAZMART. Starting in
      FY03 a contractor will manage the HAZMART EMIS tracking and free issue programs.
      18.4.1.5. SOS. All shops will ensure their HM purchases are authorized and entered into EMIS if
      they are procured through a SOS other than the HAZMART. The HAZMART should be the first
      stop for the customer to initiate the approval process. AFI 32-7086, and the upcoming ACC Sup-
      plement to the AFI, will contain comprehensive HAZMART and SOS instructions.
      18.4.1.6. IMPAC Purchases. HM IMPAC purchases will be restricted to a limited number of
      individuals in each unit, designated by their squadron commander. These individuals will receive
238                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         training and certification to minimize the purchase and use of HM. The SOS the HM was pro-
         cured through will be responsible for inputting the purchase into EMIS.
         18.4.1.7. Typical Reduction/Recycle Opportunities. Prior to making any substitution for
         chemicals used in a process, concurrence of both the office responsible for the applicable TOs and
         the base Bioenvironmental Engineer must be obtained. Examples of reduction opportunities are
         listed below.
            18.4.1.7.1. Physical Removal of Paint. Media blasting or other physical removal method
            such as sanding with vacuum capabilities can be applied to processes currently using: ben-
            zene, toluene, xylem, dichloromethane, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and methyl isobutyl
            ketone (MIBK). However, be aware physical methods of paint removal have the potential to
            generate hazardous emissions of paint constituents.
            18.4.1.7.2. Parts Washers. Parts washers using an aqueous base soap and water rather than
            solvents should be used as a replacement for degreasers. Apply this to toluene, xylene, carbon
            tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, dichloromethane, trichlorethane (TCA), trichloroethylene
            (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), MEK- and MIBK- based processes. Hot water and cit-
            ric-based compounds can also be used as substitutes for MEK and MIBK degreasers.
            18.4.1.7.3. Product Substitution. Opportunities for substitution include avoiding the use of
            canisters that contain fluorocarbons, and substitute solvents to replace TCA, TCE, PCE, MEK,
            and MIBK. Several products are available to replace both cleaning solvents and painting thin-
            ners. Consider these products when hydrocarbon solvents are required.
            18.4.1.7.4. Recycling. Recycling petroleum products and plastics reduces the purchases of
            materials containing benzene and toluene. Both filter systems and distillation systems are
            available to reclaim spent solvents. Notify Bioenvironmental Engineer prior to purchase of
            recycling units.
            18.4.1.7.5. Inorganic Chemicals. Reduction opportunities for inorganic chemicals include
            reducing the amount of water used in electroplating to concentrate the cadmium, chromium
            and nickel, removing those chemicals through precipitation, evaporation, etc. from the waste
            water and then reusing/recycling them. Avoid using cyanide in electroplating compounds.
            Use mercury substitutes. Avoid leaded paint and solder containing lead. The base environ-
            mental engineer must approve all proposed waste treatment processes and material substitu-
            tions.
         18.4.1.8. Approved Substitutions. Report approved product substitutions and process modifica-
         tions to the ACC HMMP Team for dissemination to other users.
         18.4.1.9. Product Resource. GSA has undertaken many initiatives to help prevent pollution,
         including reformulating paints and coatings, introducing water-based and citrus-based industrial
         cleaners/degreasers, and encouraging the reuse of materials in their product lines. For more infor-
         mation on their products, contact the Paints and Chemicals Center at 1-800-241-RAIN (7246).
         You may also view GSA products on their Internet homepage, GSA Advantage, at http://
         www.gsa.gov.
      18.4.2. Hazardous Waste (HW) Minimization:
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        239


     18.4.2.1. Reducing the generation of HW not only reduces the cost of HW disposal for CE, but
     also reduces regulatory vulnerability and your installation's HW management costs (e.g., man-
     power, training, paperwork).
     18.4.2.2. Goal. ACC's objective is to reduce hazardous waste disposal 50% by the end of 1997,
     60% by the end of 1999, and 80% by the end of 2005, from the CY92 baseline.
     18.4.2.3. Tracking and Reporting. Report hazardous waste disposal through ESORTS no later
     than the 10th day after the end of each quarter. Report information in pounds and include waste
     disposed, waste recycled on site, waste recycled off site, one-time waste, and any waste associated
     with a mission change.
        18.4.2.3.1. Hazardous waste disposal quantities will include all hazardous waste disposed, in
        pounds, through normal everyday installation operations regardless of whether the hazardous
        waste was disposed on-site in permitted facilities, off-site by DRMS, or through the installa-
        tions' own contracts. Include any small spills in the work area but do not report information
        associated with major spills, such as train derailments. Do not include hazardous waste
        accepted from off-site facilities in the installations' figures. Quantities should only include
        waste as defined by RCRA or corresponding state regulations; track other industrial wastes
        separately. Do not report wastes removed or treated IAW the Underground Storage Tank Pro-
        gram or resulting from the Installation Restoration Program.
        18.4.2.3.2. Disposal information can be obtained from Hazardous Waste Disposal Manifests,
        including all disposal contracts, and annual Federal and State hazardous waste disposal sum-
        maries generated at the installation. If the certificate of destruction or treatment codes on HW
        manifest indicates recycling, do not report the item as disposed, but as recycled.
     18.4.2.4. Processes Generating Hazardous Waste. Identification of new hazardous waste
     streams is ongoing and requires constant attention. Processes with associated hazardous waste
     streams typical to all installations are listed in Appendix P. Installations should also cross check
     these processes with their opportunity assessments to ensure all waste streams have been identi-
     fied. The base Bioenvironmental Engineer is responsible for defining industrial processes and
     characterizing resultant waste streams.
     18.4.2.5. Resources. Reduction opportunities and source reduction resources are contained in
     Chapter 2.
  18.4.3. Toxic Release Inventory (TRI):
     18.4.3.1. Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
     (EPCRA). This Act requires Federal facilities to submit an annual TRI report to the EPA by 1
     July each year for the previous year's data. The first report covered calendar year 1994, the base-
     line year. It is not required for our bases outside of the US.
     18.4.3.2. Goals. The DoD goal is to achieve a 50% reduction in total releases and off-site trans-
     fers of TRI toxic chemicals by 1999, based on a calendar year 1994 TRI baseline. Each base must
     also have a written plan outlining how it will contribute to the 50% DoD-wide reduction goal. The
     P2 MAP meets this requirement.
     18.4.3.3. Tracking and Reporting. The monitoring required for TRI reporting tracks chemical
     substance use throughout all parts of a facility, including what is vented, evaporated, and spilled.
     Though most ACC bases will not break the thresholds (10,000 lbs/yr) required to submit a Form
240                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         R, the process of inventorying toxic chemicals is still very important to maintain safe and econom-
         ical operations. The HAZMART and the EMIS tracking system can provide the required informa-
         tion to the environmental flight for your installation's TRI report. Copies of TRI reports are due to
         ACC/CEVQM by 15 Jun each year for the previous calendar year.
         18.4.3.4. Resources. For further information on TRI reporting, see Chapter 10.
      18.4.4. Pesticide Management:
         18.4.4.1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM is an approach to pest control that utilizes
         regular monitoring to determine if and when pest treatments are needed, and employs physical,
         mechanical, cultural, biological, and educational tactics to keep pest numbers low enough to pre-
         vent intolerable damage or annoyance. Use least-toxic chemical controls as a last resort. IPM
         focuses on trapping, sanitation and exclusion for rodent control and exclusion for bird control.
         18.4.4.2. Goals. By the end of FY97, all bases will have pest management plans prepared,
         reviewed, and updated annually by pest management professionals. By the end of FY00, the
         amount of pesticide applied annually on each installation will be reduced by 50% from the FY93
         baseline in pounds of active ingredient. By the end of FY98, all ACC pesticide applicators will be
         properly certified within two years of employment. In addition, all Contractor employees per-
         forming pest management work on ACC bases will be certified under an EPA or State Plan.
         18.4.4.3. Tracking and Reporting. HQ ACC/CEOO manages the pest management program for
         ACC and reporting will be IAW their guidance. Annual reports are due to that office by 1 Nov for
         the previous fiscal year.
         18.4.4.4. Resources. For further information on TRI reporting, see Chapter 10.
      18.4.5. Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS):
         18.4.5.1. Goals. ACC's ODS goals are two-fold: (1) reduce total issues of ODS from supply
         activities by 99% by the end of CY98 from the 1992 baseline, and (2) eliminate facility chiller
         units that use CFCs and to eliminate all Halon 1301 systems by 2000.
         18.4.5.2. Tracking and Reporting. The base CEF will report the number of Halon units and the
         quantity of Halon (in pounds) semi-annually, by the 20th of January and July, to HQ ACC/CEXF.
         The base Refrigerant Manager will report the number of ODS refrigeration units and the quantity
         of ODS (in pounds) annually, by 20 Jan to ACC CES/ESO. Logistics Environmental Managers
         and/or HAZMART personnel tracks ODS in pounds issued from any supply activity and reports to
         ACC/LGOV by the 10th day of the month following the end of each quarter.
         18.4.5.3. Resources. ODS management is addressed in Chapter 9.
      18.4.6. Municipal Solid Waste:
         18.4.6.1. Goals. The DoD and Air Force goal for this program calls for the diversion rate for
         non-hazardous solid waste to be greater than 40% by the year 2005, while ensuring integrated
         non-hazardous solid waste management programs provide an economic benefit when compared
         with disposal using landfilling and incineration alone. Reducing the compliance burden of SW
         includes eliminating or reducing the generation of SW through source reduction, materials substi-
         tution, recycling, treatment, and finally disposal.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                         241


    18.4.6.2. Tracking and Reporting. Report solid waste generation, disposal, and diversion and
    construction and demolition (C&D) debris generated, recycled, and landfilled to ACC/CEVQP via
    ESORTS no later than the 10th day after the end of each quarter. Obtaining data required in the
    report will require making contact with the different offices that keep operating records on solid
    waste management. The QRP manager is responsible for gathering and reporting data on installa-
    tion recycling operations, as well as ensuring the recycling operations and efforts are meeting AF
    and ACC goals. Track solid waste and C&D in the following quantities: tons recycled/quarter;
    tons composted/quarter; tons incinerated/quarter; tons landfilled/quarter, and tons sent for energy
    recovery, if applicable.
    18.4.6.3. Yard Waste. Grounds maintenance contracts and yard maintenance in military family
    housing generate yard waste. AFI 32-7080 requires yard waste be diverted into composting oper-
    ations as most states prohibit yard waste from their landfills.
    18.4.6.4. Composting. Yard waste, by weight, may make up to 20% of the solid waste stream.
    Yard waste composting offers the opportunity to achieve a significant reduction in solid waste dis-
    posal at a low level of technology and investment. However, processing other components of the
    waste stream, such as food waste or other organic materials through composting, may require a
    significant investment in higher technology operations. Check with local programs as a resource
    for composting material, as implementing and maintaining a composting operation on base may
    be costly.
    18.4.6.5. Recycling. Each installation will have a Qualified Recycling Program (QRP) Manager
    to be the single point of contact for all aspects of the program for the industrial base and the mili-
    tary family housing, including: solid waste reduction and reporting, composting, affirmative pro-
    curement reporting, solid waste compliance, and education. The installation commander is
    responsible for the organization and operation of the QRP. AFI 32-7080, the AF Resource,
    Recovery, and Recycling Guide (RRRG) dated May 1995, and the ACC Recycling Guide of June
    1993 includes requirements.
       18.4.6.5.1. QRP. The QRP will be an umbrella organization, consisting of up to four separate
       activities involved with recycling: appropriated funds activities; Non-appropriated funds (Ser-
       vices) operations; Army AF Exchange Service (AAFES) section; and a Defense Commissary
       Agency (DeCA) portion. All of these groups are required to report their recycling data to the
       QRP manager.
       18.4.6.5.2. Recycling Working Group. Bases should utilize a Recycling Working Group,
       subordinate to the Environmental Protection Committee (EPC), or a Quality Improvement
       Team, to effectively manage the Wing QRP. The group or team should, as a minimum, review
       the base's opportunity assessment on an annual basis.
    18.4.6.6. Basic Strategy for Reducing Solid Waste Disposal. There are two primary ways to
    reduce solid waste disposal. The preferred method is to directly reduce disposal by reducing the
    amount of waste generated. The other is to indirectly reduce disposal by diverting the solid waste
    stream to a process such as recycling or composting. Meeting the 40% diversion will require a
    combination of source reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting. Each QRP manager must ana-
    lyze the existing base waste stream and determine the most effective combination of methods.
    18.4.6.7. Service Contracts. P2 managers need to work closely with service contracts personnel
    to ensure the solid waste reduction strategy is fully represented in the terms and conditions of the
242                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         service contract, as well as being cost effective. ACC prefers to integrate base recycling require-
         ments into the solid waste disposal contract to create a single solid waste management contract;
         however, separate recycling contracts may be used in the interim.
         18.4.6.8. Other Waste Reduction Options. Some installations are uniquely situated to take
         advantage of high technology recycling facilities, waste-to-energy incineration facilities or munic-
         ipal waste incinerators that are part of the local waste management system to recycle or reduce
         their solid waste stream.
      18.4.7. Affirmative Procurement:
         18.4.7.1. Definition. Affirmative procurement is the purchase of products containing recycled
         material. The stimulus of government procurement helps to close the recycling loop by encourag-
         ing market demand for recovered materials. Each ACC installation will develop an Affirmative
         Procurement program in accordance with EO 13101, "Greening the Government through Waste
         Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition".
         18.4.7.2. Goals. By March of 1999, the Federal Environmental Executive (FEE) will develop a
         Strategic Plan to include direction and initiatives for acquisition of recycled and recyclable prod-
         ucts and environmentally preferable products and services. Upon this guidance, ACC will set
         goals to increase the procurement of products that are made with recovered materials; review and
         revise standards and product specifications; and assess and evaluate compliance and reporting
         requirements.
         18.4.7.3. Comprehensive Procurement Guideline (CPG) Items. The EPA designates specific
         items that will contain recycled materials for Federal procurement. Current CPG items are: paper
         and paper products; lubricating oil; retread tires; building insulation products; cement and con-
         crete containing fly ash; reclaimed engine coolants (vehicular products); structural fiberboard,
         laminated paperboard, cement/concrete containing ground granulated blast furnace slag, carpet,
         floor tiles and patio; traffic barricades and traffic cones; playground surfaces and running tracks;
         hydraulic mulch and yard trimmings compost; office recycling containers, office waste recepta-
         cles, plastic desktop accessories, remanufactured toner cartridges, binders, and plastic trash bags.
            18.4.7.3.1. For high speed copier paper, offset paper, forms bond, computer printout paper,
            carbonless paper, file folders and white woven envelopes, the minimum content standard shall
            be no less than 30% post-consumer materials beginning 31 Dec 98. As an alternative to the
            above, for all printing and writing papers, the minimum content standard shall be no less than
            50% recovered materials that are a waste material byproduct of a finished product other than a
            paper or textile product which would otherwise by disposed of in a landfill, as determined by
            the State in which the facility is located.
            18.4.7.3.2. Effective January 1, 1999, no executive branch agency shall purchase, sell, or
            arrange for the purchase or, printing and writing paper that fails to meet the minimum require-
            ments listed in the previous paragraph.
         18.4.7.4. The USDA Biobased Products Coordination Council will issue a Biobased Products
         List to be published in spring of 1999. Installations will be encouraged to modify their affirmative
         procurement program to give consideration to those products.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                       243


     18.4.7.5. Typical Opportunities. Installations must establish an aggressive affirmative procure-
     ment program to meet ACC goals. Use the following list to establish an effective procurement
     program. Use it to generate ideas and actions unique to your base.
        18.4.7.5.1. Revise specifications for the designated items to give preference to recycled mate-
        rial. (Contracting, CE).
        18.4.7.5.2. Require all newly acquired or leased copy machines be capable of using recycled
        paper and automatically producing two-sided copies. (Requesting Agency, Contracting).
        18.4.7.5.3. Require recycled toner cartridges for copy machines and laser printers. (IM).
        18.4.7.5.4. Require grounds maintenance contractors to use composted materials in landscap-
        ing. (CE, Contracting).
        18.4.7.5.5. Require janitorial contractors to supply trash bags and hand towels made from
        recycled materials (CE, Contracting).
        18.4.7.5.6. Require use of building products containing recycled materials when designing
        and writing specifications for facility repair or new construction projects. (CE, Contracting).
        18.4.7.5.7. Transfer documents electronically where possible. (All base organizations).
        18.4.7.5.8. Purchase office products that are made using recycled plastics or other recycled
        materials. (All).
        18.4.7.5.9. Specify re-refined oil for lubricating oil purposes. (CE, Transportation).
        18.4.7.5.10. Specify retread tires for all vehicles approved for retread use. (Transportation).
     18.4.7.6. Unique Aspects. The absence of regulators, inspectors, fines, and health and safety
     risks make affirmative procurement a unique component of the pollution prevention program.
     Many issues such as coding recycled products for tracking, reviewing performance standards of
     recycled products, and revising procurement procedures require a coordinated effort among per-
     sonnel outside the typical P2 arena. Close coordination among CE, IM, logistics and procurement
     personnel is essential to successful implementation of the affirmative procurement program. As a
     result, installations should establish a team through the Pollution Prevention Working Group to
     address the issues unique to affirmative procurement.
     18.4.7.7. Product Sources:
        18.4.7.7.1. When procuring products from General Services Administration (GSA), installa-
        tions should identify products included in GSA's "Environmental Products Guide". Contact
        the GSA Centralized Mailing List Service in Fort Worth, TX 76115, commercial (817)
        334-5215 or DSN 739-7369, to obtain copies.
        18.4.7.7.2. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) also publishes an "Environmentally Pre-
        ferred Products" catalogue. To receive copies, contact the Defense Supply Center Richmond's
        (DSCR) Marketing Office at (800) 552-2852, or DSN 695-5699. The catalogue is also avail-
        able on the Internet at http://www.dscr.dla.mil/products/epa/eppcat.htm. You can also
        place MILSTRIP requisitions for any DLA-managed NSNs through the web site.
  18.4.8. Energy Conservation:
244                                   ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


         18.4.8.1. Goals. The Air Force and ACC goal to reduce facility energy (natural gas, coal, elec-
         tricity, fuel oil, etc.) is 30% by 2005, and 35% by 2010 on a BTU/sq ft basis, with 1985 consump-
         tion as the baseline. We also are required to identify and accomplish all energy conservation
         actions that pay back in ten years or less by the year 2005. Data input into the Defense Utility
         Energy Reporting System is used to track progress toward the goals. These goals apply to the
         energy consumed within the facility (computers, appliances, equipment, etc.) not just the energy
         used to operate the facility (heating, air conditioning, lights, hot water, etc.). Reduced energy con-
         sumption equates directly to pollution avoidance.
         18.4.8.2. Program. Each base should have a designated Facility Energy Program Manager, typi-
         cally located in the Maintenance Engineering Flight within CE. The Energy program has two
         main thrusts - Energy Awareness and Energy Project Investment. Energy Awareness simply
         means not using energy when it is not needed. Energy Project Investment is divided into three
         areas: government funds, utility company funds and private sector funds. Two special DoD pro-
         grams, Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) and Federal Energy Management Pro-
         gram (FEMP), have been provided by Congress to fund energy projects. Also, utility companies
         may offer rebates for installing energy efficient equipment and have Demand Side Management
         programs to fund energy efficient equipment installation on their customers' facilities. Within the
         private sector, many companies have developed programs such as Shared Energy Savings and
         Energy Savings Performance Contracting. These programs pay for installation of energy efficient
         equipment on a customer's facilities up front. They are paid out of the savings realized by the cus-
         tomer.
      18.4.9. Water Conservation:
         18.4.9.1. Energy Cycle. Water conservation is related to energy conservation in that approxi-
         mately 80% of the cost of water results from the energy required to provide the water. In addition,
         reductions in water create corresponding reductions in wastewater treatment, which in turn
         reduces energy requirements, chemical usage, and the environmental compliance issues associ-
         ated with effluent discharge.
         18.4.9.2. Goals. Water use surveys at all ACC installations were completed in 1995, as required
         by EO 12902. This requirement was satisfied using data captured by the Renewable and Energy
         Efficiency Planning (REEP) model on all ACC bases. Additionally, EO 12902 requires compre-
         hensive facility audits of Federal facilities by 2005 to identify water conservation projects that
         have a payback of 10 years of less. These audits are intended to identify projects to reduce water
         consumption in individual facilities or groups of facilities such as dorms, hangars, and administra-
         tion facilities. We are not expecting an audit of every facility but of representative facilities and
         only when the potential cost effective result is clear. Every base is required to develop a strategy
         to complete these audits. Approximately 10% of the facilities must be audited each year. These
         audits will be no more detailed than necessary to identify projects that are cost effective.
         18.4.9.3. Water Program. The base water program should focus on performing the comprehen-
         sive facility audits and promoting effective project management. Including Water Conservation
         projects in the P2 MAP along with the Energy Conservation projects will provide project visibil-
         ity, help ensure funding, and provide a mechanism to track their implementation. Funding to exe-
         cute Water Conservation projects comes from the same sources used to fund Energy projects.
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                      245


    18.4.9.4. Typical Opportunities. Water projects with the most economical payback generally
    include: plumbing retrofits (shower heads, toilets, etc.); leak detection and repair; modifications
    to cooling towers, boilers and process equipment; and xeriscaping, wastewater reuse, and other
    cost-effective landscaping techniques.

                                               FUNDING

19.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Funding
      19.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) The Air Force Instructions for environmental management give
      broad guidelines on how the Air Force complies with environmental laws and regulations. The pro-
      cess owner must identify the requirement. Environmental requirements are driven by the Environmen-
      tal Protection Agency, the New Mexico Environment Department and other agencies that provide
      regulatory rules and guidelines for conducting activities in an environmentally sound manner. Envi-
      ronmental funding requirements are processed through the 49 CES/CEV on a case-by-case basis. All
      environmental requirements will be addressed by the UEC to the 49 CES/CEV.
      19.1.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Validation by the 49 CES/CEV. Once all of the appropriate forms
      are ac-complished, the 49 CES/CEV, through guidance documents and AF Policy letters, determines
      if the requirement is valid.
      19.1.3. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Approval. The approval authority for all environmental require-
      ments is the ELC/ESOHC. Once the 49 CES/CEV has validated the requirement, the appropriate
      sub-committee will approve the funding for the requirement.

Emission Fees—The new method of calculating emissions by the potential to emit requirement will
increase the Tons Per Year (TPY) totals and the final permit cost to the base. The permit fee structure is
calculated by multiplying the TPY totals times the emission fee per ton. Fee schedules will range from
$25 plus inflation per ton of emissions. CO emissions may be exempt from fees in some states, but will
count toward major source designation.

Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984. These restrictions mandate that hazardous waste meet
certain treatment criteria or concentration levels prior to being disposed of in or on land.
Lead—A common heavy metal found in small arms ammunition and a RCRA regulated hazardous
constituent for toxicity when exceeding the maximum contaminant level of 5 parts per million (ppm) as
determined by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). Adversely affects the central and
peripheral nervous systems and kidneys.
Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 Funding—Also known as class 1, class 2 and class 3. See Chapter 11.
Environmental Compliance Funding Guidance.
Major (Stationary) Source—A source of air pollutants, located on one or more contiguous or adjacent
properties, under common control of the same person, that directly emits or has the potential to emit, 100
tpy or more of any air pollutant as defined under Section 302 of the CAA. Some fugitive emissions may
not be considered in determining if a source is major. Under Section 112(b) of the CAA, emissions of 10
tpy of a HAP or 25 tpy of a combination of HAPs will be designated a major source. For particulate
matter (PM-10) non-attainment area classified as "serious", sources with the potential to emit 70 tpy or

high concentrations at ground level, the gas acts as an irritant to the eyes and respiratory tract.
254                                 ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


Offsets—Reductions of emissions in an amount equal to or greater than the emissions increase from the
new or modified source. Offsets should be obtained from an emissions source within the same
non-attainment area.
PCB Article—Any manufactured article, other than a PCB Container, that contains PCBs and whose
surface(s) has been in direct contact with PCBs. "PCB Article" includes capacitors, transformers, electric
motors, pumps, pipes and any other manufactured item (1) which is formed to a specific shape or design
during manufacture, (2) which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or
design during end use, and (3) which has either no change of chemical composition during its end use or
only those changes of composition that have no commercial purpose separate from that of the PCB
Article.
PCB Article Container—Any package, can, bottle, bag, barrel, drum, tank, or other vessel used to
contain PCB Articles or PCB Equipment, and whose surface(s) has not been in direct contact with PCBs.
PCB Container—Any package, can, bottle, bag, barrel, drum, tank, or other vessel that contains PCBs or
PCB Articles and whose surface(s) has been in direct contact with PCBs.
PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment—Any electrical equipment, including but not limited to
transformers (including those used in railway locomotives and self-propelled cars), capacitors, circuit
breakers, reclosers, voltage regulators, switches (including sectionalizers and motor starters),
electromagnets, and cable, that contain 50 ppm or greater PCB, but less than 500 ppm PCB. Oil-filled
electrical equipment other than circuit breakers, reclosers, and cable whose PCB concentration is
unknown must be assumed to be PCB Contaminated Electrical Equipment. (See 761.30(a) and (h) for
provisions permitting reclassification of electrical equipment containing 500 ppm or greater PCBs to
PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment).
PCB Equipment—any manufactured item, other than a PCB Container or a PCB Article Container,
which contains a PCB Article or other PCB Equipment, and includes microwave ovens, electronic
equipment, and fluorescent light ballast's and fixtures.
PCB-Free—This term is an Air Force policy description that applies only if all electrical items in use on
an installation are properly labeled as "non-PCB" (<50 ppm), a detailed equipment inventory is available
with laboratory analysis results for each non-sealed item, and no PCB items are physically stored
out-of-service on base awaiting disposal (including items at an on-base DRMO). The "PCB-free"
requirements do not apply to small capacitors, regulators, switches and other small sealed items (less than
three pounds of dielectric fluid). Small capacitors are also exempt from the disposal requirements of 40
CFR 761, and may be disposed of as municipal solid waste. (Fluorescent light fixtures may have small
PCB capacitors.)
PCB Item—Any PCB Article, PCB Article Container, PCB Container, or PCB Equipment, that
deliberately or unintentionally contains or has a part of it any PCB or PCBs.
PCB Transformer —Any transformer that contains 500 ppm PCB or greater.
PCB Waste(s)—Those PCBs and PCB items that are subject to the disposal requirements of subpart D of
40 CFR 761.
Pending Enforcement Action—An enforcement action for which the deficiency(ies) has been corrected,
but remains open, pending agreement by the regulator that it is closed.
Point Source Discharge—The CWA defines a point source as any discernible, confined, and discrete
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                            255


conveyance (includes pipes, ditches, channels, tunnels, conduits, wells, discrete fissure, container, rolling
stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, landfill leachate collection system, vessel or other floating
craft system). Does not include return flows from irrigated agriculture or agricultural storm water runoff".
Pollution Prevention—The use of processes, practices, or products that reduce or eliminate the
generation of pollutants and wastes. This includes the conservation of natural resources and use of
efficient energy resources. The focus of Pollution Prevention is to reduce pollution sources, followed by
reuse of resources, then recycling of resources, and finally the use of disposal as the last resort.
Process Wastewater—Any water which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact
with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, byproduct, or waste
product.
Potential to Emit—The actual emissions of a source if it were operated 24 hours a day, 365 days a year
(i.e. 8,760 hours of operation annually) Used to calculate major source.
PSD—The Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulation is found at 40 CFR 52 for state
implementation plans and 40 CFR 51.24. It has been in existence for new sources and includes 28
specified categories that, under normal operating conditions, should not impact ACC bases. Other
methods of causing new construction projects to require a PSD review include, being a new major source
that has a potential to emit 250 tpy of a regulated pollutant or a modification to an existing major source
that produces a potential to emit more than the listed "trigger" values in the text. A source may provide an
option to stay under PSD review by the use of permit limitations. An example of this option would be an
air emissions permit limiting a jet engine test cell to 39.9 tpy of NOx per year. This approach is
acceptable if the 5-year growth of the base will not drive the emissions over the permit limit.
Process Operator—The 20 Dec 1984 Federal Register (49 FR 49569) defines the operator of the process
to be the operator who generates the waste for a hazardous waste satellite accumulation point. The EPA
does not clarify that this a single individual or group of person(s). Typically, the person or persons that
perform the maintenance operation may be considered operators of a process; however, shops typically
assign one or two maintenance personnel to be responsible for hazardous waste storage areas.
Radon—Radon is a naturally occurring, odorless, gaseous decay product of uranium. It has been
proposed that radon provides about one-half of the radiation to which the average American is exposed
typically in their own homes. The threat comes from the inhalation of the gas released from water during
showering, bathing, cooking, and other water uses. Ingestion of water does not appear to present a threat.
RCO—Regional Compliance Officers. Regional Compliance Officers are assigned to the Air Force
Center of Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) with locations in Atlanta Georgia, Dallas, Texas, and San
Francisco, California. One task of the RCOs is to validate Open Enforcement Action (OEA) status with
issuing regulatory agencies. They are also responsible for preparing all MAJCOM semi-annual OEA
briefing to USAF/CE and SAF/MIQ. They also provide support for many other environmental tasks upon
request.
RCRA—The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act passed by Congress in 1976 which establishes
the management of hazardous waste from cradle to grave.
RCRA Corrective Actions—The terminology applied to that portion of the RCRA program where
substance releases have occurred which require clean-up under the regulations of RCRA. Also referred to
as RCAP or the RCRA Corrective Actions Program.
RCRA Treatment—A process designed to alter the "physical, chemical, or biological character or
256                                  ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006


composition of any hazardous waste so as to neutralize such waste, or so as to recover energy or material
resources from the waste, or to render such waste non-hazardous, or less hazardous; safer to transport,
store, or dispose of; or amenable for recovery, amenable for storage, or reduced in volume". Physical
separation of lead fragments from the soil does not constitute RCRA treatment, however, any other
processes such as stabilization and soil washing which separates lead from lead contaminated soil is
RCRA treatment and is illegal without applying for and receiving an RCRA treatment permit.
Root Cause —The result of an analysis made during an Environmental Incident Investigation Board
(EIIB), using the Root Cause Analysis Instructions found in Chapter 14 of this manual.
SAR—Small Arms Range. Ranges operated and maintained by the Combat Arms Training and

Squadron.
Satellite Accumulation Point—Referenced in 40 CFR 262.34(c). Generators of hazardous waste may
store up to a total of 55 gallons of hazardous waste per satellite accumulation point provided that the
containers are labeled with the words "Hazardous Waste," the container is located at or near the point of
generation of the waste, the satellite point is under the control of the operator of the process generating the
waste, the container is in good condition and compatible with the waste it contains, and the container is
closed unless adding or removing waste.
Scrap Metal—Bits and pieces of metal parts or metal pieces that may be combined together with bolts
and soldering which when worn or superfluous can be recycled. Spent small arms ammunition can fall
into this category and be exempt from hazardous waste regulations under the scrap metal exclusion. The
key to this exclusion is that the spent ammunition must be recycled.
Significant Materials—Raw materials; fuels; materials such as solvents, detergents, and plastic pellets;
finished materials such as metallic products, raw materials used in food processing or production;
hazardous substances designated under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); any chemical the facility is required to report pursuant to
section 313 of Title III of Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA); fertilizers;
pesticides; and waste products such as ashes, slag, and sludge that have the potential to be released with
storm water discharges.
Soil Washing—The process of treating soil in an aqueous acid solution to remove the lead.
Solid Waste (1)—Any discarded material not excluded by 40 CFR 261.4(a) or 260.30 and 260.31. A
discarded material is one that is abandoned, recycled, or considered inherently waste-like. Materials are
abandoned if they are disposed of , burned or incinerated, or accumulated, stored, or treated (not recycled)
before they are abandoned by being disposed of, burned, or incinerated. For recycled materials (or
materials accumulated, stored, or treated before recycling) that are considered solid wastes, see 40 CFR
261.2(c) for additional definitions.
Solid Waste (2)—In the case of small arms ammunition used at firing ranges, the spent ammunition is not
a RCRA solid waste until it is abandoned or disposed. This occurs either when the spent bullets are
removed from the berm for disposal (not for recycling) or if the berm is deemed inactive.
Solid Waste Management Unit—Any discernible unit (to include regulated units) at which RCRA solid
waste have been placed at any time, irrespective of whether the unit was intended for the management of
solid or hazardous waste.
Source—As defined by the Clean Air Act, any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or
ACCMAN32-7051_HOLLOMANAFBSUP1_I 22 MARCH 2006                                                        257


may emit an air pollutant for which a national standard is in effect; 40 CFR 52.01(a)(1992).
SOW—An abbreviation for Statement of Work. A SOW is the description of the tasks to be completed in
a contract.
Stabilization—The process of adding ingredients to fill in porous spaces in the soil to immobilize
contaminants in the soil.
Storm Water Discharge —Surface water runoff, snow melt runoff, surface runoff and drainage, but not
process or non-process wastewater.
TCLP—Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure. EPA Method 1311 specified in 40 CFR 261,
Appendix II is EPA's approved method for evaluating any toxicity characteristics of a solid waste.
Trip Blanks—In connection with air, soil, or water sampling a trip blank is prepared along with the
sample units to ensure strict quality control. This known quantity (the trip blank) is shipped along with
other gathered samples. Analysis of the trip blank will reveal whether any cross contamination occurred
during the sample collection, shipment and storage process. See also Duplicate Field Sample.
UST—Underground Storage Tank. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulations, a
tank with at least 10 percent of its volume beneath the ground, including attached pipes.
VOC—Volatile Organic Compound. A compound containing carbon and hydrogen or containing carbon
and hydrogen in a combination with any other element. Has a vapor pressure of 1.5 pounds per square
inch absolute or greater under storage conditions.
Unresolved Enforcement Action—An enforcement action for which the deficiency (ies) have not been
corrected by the receiving installation.
Waters of the U.S—Waters of the United States as defined in 40 CFR 122.2. This is a legal term of art
that has been interpreted by a number of court decisions. Consult JAV if you have questions about EPA's
jurisdiction over a particular water or the regulatory status of a water.

DENT INVESTIGATION BOARD 01-04
1. THE FOLLOWING IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND ACTION AS NECESSARY.
IF A SIMILAR CONDITION EXISTS AT YOUR BASE, WE RECOMMEND YOU TAKE APPROPRI-
ATE ACTION.
2. AN ACC BASE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A CATEGORY III ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENT
RESULTING FROM A SEWAGE SPILL CAUSED BY FAILURE OF A SANITARY SEWER PIPE.
3. THE SINGLE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS FAILURE OF AN EXISTING SEWAGE
PIPE DUE TO AGE AND TYPE OF MATERIAL (CLAY) USED.
4. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE SPILL WERE:
A. A CONTRACTOR INSTALLED A NEW STORMWATER DRAIN PIPE BULKHEAD IN THE
IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE FAILED SEWER PIPE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S
ACTIVITIES IN THIS IMMEDIATE AREA DISRUPTED PACKED SOIL THAT HAD ENABLED
THE AGED PIPES TO MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY. THE COMPACTION OF THE SOIL AND
THE ADDED WEIGHT OF THE NEW DRAIN PIPE MAY HAVE FURTHER INCREASED THIS
IMPACT. HOWEVER, IT IS CLEAR IN THE DIGGING PERMIT THAT THE CONTRACTOR WAS
NOT INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE SEWER PIPE.
B. A SEWAGE BLOCKAGE/BACK-UP PRIOR TO THE LEAK WAS CLEARED BY "BLOWING
OUT" THE PIPE--FORCEFULLY PUSHING A HIGH VOLUME OF WATER THROUGH THE PIPE
TO BREAK UP THE BLOCKAGE. THIS PROCEDURE COULD HAVE DISRUPTED THE AGED
PIPE'S INTEGRITY.
5. LESSONS LEARNED ARE:
A. ENSURE ACCURATE MAPPING OF ALL UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE. ACCU-
RATE UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE MAPS WILL ENABLE CONTRACTORS TO
LOCATE BURIED LINES CLOSE TO JOBSITES.
B. DEVELOP A SCHEDULE TO ACCOMPLISH THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CURRENT CLAY
SEWER PIPES ESPECIALLY AT HIGH USE AREAS.

                          EIIB ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

A5.1. Purpose. This procedure provides a method to identify conditions that allow environmental inci-
dents to occur. It also helps identify direct causes of the incident or finding, contributing factors resulting
in the incident or finding, and ultimately the root cause that, if resolved, would eliminate the conditions
allowing the incident or finding to recur. These instructions intend to assist the environmental novice to
perform a root cause analysis, and provide sufficient guidance such that analyses of similar incidents or
findings by different people will have the same result.
   A5.1.1. Root cause analysis enables the command to:
       A5.1.1.1. Understand the sequence of events that led to an incident or finding.
       A5.1.1.2. See the differences between actual conditions and desired conditions.
       A5.1.1.3. Know the root cause, contributing factors, and direct cause of an incident or finding.
       A5.1.1.4. Provide a target at which to direct corrective actions and prevent recurrence.
   A5.1.2. This procedure shall be used to analyze the root cause of:
       A5.1.2.1. Substance releases (such as POL spills).
       A5.1.2.2. The receipt of a regulatory enforcement action.

A5.2. Definitions
   A5.2.1. Contributing Factor. A factor that, if corrected, would not prevent the primary effect but is
   important enough to be recognized as needing corrective action to improve the quality of the process
   or product.
   A5.2.2. Direct Cause. The cause which directly resulted in the primary effect.
   A5.2.3. Finding. A perceived non-compliant situation discovered during an Environmental Compli-
   ance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) audit which, if not resolved, could lead to a
   regulatory enforcement action.
   A5.2.4. Incident. Either a substance release (such as a POL spill) or the receipt of a regulatory
   enforcement action investigated under the HQ ACC Environmental Incident Investigation Board
   (EIIB) policy.
   A5.2.5. Primary Effect. The incident or finding that the root cause allowed to occur and which will
   be prevented if the root cause is resolved.
   A5.2.6. Root Cause Analysis. The systematic process used to identify the most basic reason for an
   incident or finding which, if corrected, will prevent occurrence or recurrence.
   A5.2.7. Root Cause. The most basic reason for an incident or finding which, if corrected, will pre-
   vent recurrence. To be valid the root cause must:
       A5.2.7.1. Prevent recurrence when corrected.
       A5.2.7.2. Be within HQ ACC control.

         A5.2.7.3. Allow other objectives to be met (e.g., remain in operation).
      A5.2.8. Systemic Factors. Those interdependent activities or elements that interact in an orderly
      arrangement, one in relation to the other, to facilitate the desired performance of a major activity or
      organization.

                      Brief Description of conditions at time of incident or finding:


Primary Effect        Description of incident or finding that the root cause analysis will prevent from occurring or
                      recurring. Identify the governing regulation or statute, if applicable (i.e.,improper labeling on
                      hazardous waste drums).


Direct Cause          Explain exactly what action or condition resulted in an EIIB incident or ECAMP finding (i.e.
                      labels on hazardous waste drums were faded and illegible).




Contributing          What factors led to the conditions described above? What allowed the direct cause condition?
Factors               (i.e., accumulation point manager allowed drum labels to become sunbleached; were exposed to
                      elements because there was no covered storage available).




Root Cause            Identify a basic root cause behind each contributing factor. Ask "Why" repeatedly until cause
                      can be broken down to basics. Refer to the outline and categorize each from root cause listing.
