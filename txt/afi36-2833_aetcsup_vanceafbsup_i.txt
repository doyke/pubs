                 THE VANCE WELL DONE AWARD FOR FLIGHT SAFETY

                                 CHRISTOPHER R. McALEAR

First Lieutenant Christopher R. McAlear distinguished himself by outstanding achievement at
Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma on 25 January 2010. While flying with a new student at the
auxiliary field, Lieutenant McAlear experienced a bird strike near the left wing root that tore a 2-
foot by 5-inch hole in the aircraft. He calmly climbed the aircraft up and performed a
controllability check that uncovered a massive fuel leak from the left wing and a controllable
airspeed of 97 Knots Indicated Air Speed. He then maneuvered the aircraft to final for a long
straight-in approach, flawlessly landed the aircraft, and brought it to a stop 4,000 feet down the
runway. His cool professionalism prevented a bad situation from becoming much worse. First
Lieutenant McAlear’s heroic actions reflect great credit upon himself and the 71st Flying
Training Wing.
