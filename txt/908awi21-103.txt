This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. It establishes policies and
procedures for Acceptance/Functional Check Flights within the 908th Airlift Wing. It applies to
all affected personnel within the 908th Maintenance Group and the 908th Operations Group, at
Maxwell AFB, Alabama. This publication applies to all members assigned to the 908th Airlift
Wing (AW). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to 908
MXG/MXG using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF
Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure that all

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. Responsibility. The 908th Maintenance Group Commander (MXG), 908th Operations
Group Commander (OG), Aircrew, Quality Assurance (QA), Maintenance Operations Control
(MOC), Debrief/Dispatch Section, and Maintenance Supervisors at all levels will ensure
compliance with this instruction.
2. General:
 2                                                                908AWI21-103 13 JUNE 2012


     2.1. Functional Check Flights (FCF), to include Operational Check Flights (OCF), are
     performed to ensure aircraft are airworthy and capable of accomplishing the mission.
     However, FCFs are not flown when a Maintenance Operational Check, prescribed by a
     technical directive, can determine the airworthiness of an aircraft. Requirements for FCFs,
     OCFs, and High Speed Taxi Checks (HSTC) will be done in accordance with T.O. 1-1-300,
     Acceptance/Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks; and T.O. 1C-
     130A-6, Aircraft Scheduled Inspection and Maintenance Instruction, section 11, part C.
     2.2. OCFs are defined as flights done to verify a maintenance condition or to provide
     additional information to maintenance when troubleshooting an aircrew identified
     discrepancy. OCF’s will be flown by experienced aircrews and will be accomplished
     following the same criteria as FCF. OCFs will be flown only when it is not feasible to
     determine safe operations on the ground or when shop testing will not work.
     2.3. HSTC is defined as a maintenance request for aircraft ground taxi operations at higher
     than normal taxi speeds. HSTCs will not be accomplished without MXG/OG Group
     Commander’s authorization. Qualified FCF Aircrews will accomplish HSTCs. Aircraft will
     be configured with minimum fuel to minimize brake and tire wear. Aircrews will complete a
     take-off and landing data card to confirm that the allowable taxi speed still ensures actual
     refusal speed. The approved HST checklist/briefing (attachment 2) will be utilized prior to
     HSTC.
3. Procedures:
     3.1. Maintenance Flight Chief/Supervisors will notify QA of all maintenance actions that
     require an ACF/FCF/OCF or HSTC.
     3.2. QA will coordinate with the MOC regarding Estimated Time in Commission (ETIC),
     servicing, in-flight test requirements, and other factors pertinent to the ACF/FCF.
     3.3. HSTCs will only be performed as a last resort measure, and will have the full
     authorization from the MXG/CC and OG/CC.
     3.4. HSTCs will follow the same procedure as FCFs.
     3.5. All pertinent data to include warning, cautions, and speeds for safe stopping distances
     will be included on the HSTC Briefing Checklist.
     3.6. Ensure the aircraft has a current preflight inspection, is serviced with 30,000 pounds of
     fuel, (except HSTC) and an exceptional release accomplished
     3.7. When the aircraft is in-commission, the Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS)
     Section will make available to QA all applicable records for review, to include engine
     performance run data when required.
     3.8. When QA is satisfied that the ETIC will be met and the aircraft is ready for an
     FCF/OCF/HSTC, they will then coordinate scheduling and crew availability with Operations,
     and notify Debrief/Dispatch Section of the proposed take-off time and date.
     3.9. ACF/FCF/OCF/HSTC crewmembers will report to the QA office 2+45 hours prior to
     take-off time in order to review mission requirements and brief items in T.O. 1-1-300 and
     1C-130E(H)-6CF-1, Acceptance/Functional Check Flight Procedures.
908AWI21-103 13 JUNE 2012                                                               3


  3.10. Upon completion of the ACF/FCF/OCF/HSTC, the aircrew or individual crew
  members designated by the aircraft commander will report to the QA office or designated
  location with the AFTO Forms 781 Binder for debriefing.
  3.11. QA will review the ACF/FCF/OCF/HSTC checklist and AFTO Forms 781 Binder to
  ensure all checks and entries have been made, and then will forward to the Documentation
  Section.
  3.12. All accumulated documentation will be destroyed in accordance with in accordance
  with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records.
