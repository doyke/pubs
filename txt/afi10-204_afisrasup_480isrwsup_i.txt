SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Instruction title has
been changed to more accurately reflect document contents. This revision establishes exercise
management products and organizations directed in Program Action Directive (PAD) 07-13
(paragraph 1.3.5); implements Service NEP participation directed in DoDI 3020.47,
(paragraph 1.3.6); eliminates Chapter 2 (Responsibilities) and incorporates revised exercise
program responsibilities into Chapter 1 (paragraph 1.4); removes the following chapters:
Chapter 4 (Master Scenario Event List (MSEL)), Chapter 5 (Air Force After-Action Reporting
System (AFAARS)), Chapter 6 (Air Force Remedial Action Program (AFRAP)), Chapter 7
(Staff and Training). The new Chapter 2 (Exercise Cycle) incorporates MSEL information
(paragraph 2.2.7) and After Action Reporting (AAR) guidance (paragraph 2.4). The new
Chapter 3 (Exercise Funding and Programming) provides new guidance regarding Service
Incremental Funding (SIF), Commercial Ticket Program (CTP), and Port Handling/Inland
Transportation (PH/IT) procedures based on consolidating NEP/JEP funding into the Office of
the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2)
program. The new Chapter 4 identifies prescribed and adopted forms. The Instruction also
adds Attachments 2, 3, and 4 addressing the AFJECT, EIPT, and EGOSG.

                                            Chapter 1

                    EXERCISE GUIDELINES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. Exercises play an essential role in preparing United States Air Force (USAF)
forces to conduct air, space, and cyberspace operations and perform their mission essential tasks.
This Instruction provides direction and additional policy guidance regarding Air Force
participation in the National Exercise Program (NEP) and the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
(CJCS)-designated exercises that constitute the Joint Exercise Program (JEP). It supports the
Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training, CJCSM 3500.03B, Joint Training Manual for
the Armed Forces of the United States, and CJCSI 3500.01E, Joint Training Policy and
Guidance for the Armed Forces of the United States. It defines actions and responsibilities
during the exercise cycle and outlines procedures for programming and budgeting exercise
funds. It establishes organizations and processes to help manage Air Force NEP/JEP exercise
participation and support.
     1.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) The AFISRA Exercise Program exists to provide AFISRA units
     with headquarters oversight, guidance, and support for participation in joint, combined, and
     Air Force exercises. AFISRA will further prioritize participation and use of unit resources
     based on the ability to maximize the integration or introduction of ISR-specific objectives in
     the exercise. The AFISRA Exercise Program goals are to support the achievement of exercise
     training objectives, enhance exercise scenario simulations, provide AFISRA operators pre-
     deployment training in wartime roles, and, if practical, utilize exercises as a baseline to
     develop and achieve AFISRA-specific training objectives.
     1.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) The AFISRA Exercise Program provides coordination between
     AFISRA and directly subordinate wings/centers/groups to effectively integrate a broad range
     of AFISRA missions and capabilities into military exercises worldwide.
1.2. Objective. Air Force units participate in NEP and JEP exercises to hone and refine their
execution of mission essential and supporting tasks, validate training, improve response
capabilities, and enhance and evaluate readiness. The Air Force goal is to optimize the benefits
of participating in these exercises.
     1.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Exercises with a heavy focus on Joint Forces Air Component
     Commander (JFACC)/Combined Forces Air Component Commander (CFACC) training
     objectives, with employment of a full Air Operations Center (AOC), and National Exercise
     Program (NEP) Tier I exercises will typically be identified by AFISRA/A3XY as AFISRA
     Priority Exercises.
1.3. Exercise Guidelines.
     1.3.1. Concept. Exercises must embody a “train the way we fight” philosophy and should
     exercise actual command relationships as much as possible. Exercises should provide
     opportunities to assess real-world capabilities consistent with safety, security, and overall
     exercise objectives. When appropriate, exercises should also incorporate other requirements
     and operational challenges, such as logistics, support, force protection, and the ability to
     operate in a degraded/contaminated environment, including biological, radiological, and
     nuclear (CBRN) environments. Whenever possible, exercises should seek to employ and
AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                  7


  evaluate current or proposed plans, policies, procedures, processes, Warfighter Challenges,
  and doctrine.
  1.3.2. Conditions. Exercises give commanders an opportunity to assess the ability of their
  units to perform their missions and should be conducted and examined under “no-fault”
  conditions. Exercise participants should have the “freedom to fail” within the bounds of safe
  operations and the need to meet exercise objectives. Per CJCSI 3500.01E, assessments for
  CE2 exercise will be recorded in the Joint Training Information Management System
  (JTIMS). Unless part of a formal inspection, do not grade individual or unit performance.
  Formal inspections, such as operational readiness inspections (ORIs), may be conducted
  during exercises provided graded events are clearly identified to all exercise participants and
  grading will only affect inspected units.
  1.3.3. Linking Exercises. To take advantage of the synergy that exists when exercises
  require similar skill sets and have common venues, scenarios, and objectives, Air Force
  Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting
  Units (DRUs) should consider linking their sponsored exercises with CJCS-sponsored,
  CCDR-sponsored, or other appropriate exercises whenever possible.
     1.3.3.1. Scheduling. Participating in NEP and JEP exercises and also supporting Air
     Force-sponsored exercises places considerable stress on Air Force units and often strains
     available assets. Force providers must determine their ability to support all exercise
     requirements as they develop their exercise schedules and make exercise commitments.
  1.3.4. Support Requirements.
     1.3.4.1. Participants. Exercises provide participants the opportunity to practice actions
     and procedures in an instructive environment. To ensure the appropriate personnel
     benefit from this exercise experience, role players and substitutes for key personnel
     should be kept to a minimum.
     1.3.4.2. War Reserve Materiel (WRM). WRM may be used to provide Indirect Mission
     Support for Joint Chiefs of Staff and Air Force exercises with proper
     approval/authorization and funding, as outlined in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel
     (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. WRM assets will not be used for exercises
     without appropriate release authority.
     1.3.4.3. Preparation. Exercise planners should review operational, logistical, support,
     and force protection requirements, command relationships, applicable plans, After
     Actions Reports (AAR), lessons learned databases, corrective action reports, observation
     reports, and guidance from higher headquarters to determine appropriate exercise
     objectives and ensure the exercise design supports meeting these objectives.
     1.3.4.4. Environmental Compliance. Exercise sponsors will ensure exercises conducted
     in the United States, its territories, and possessions comply with applicable Federal, State,
     interstate, and local environmental requirements. Air Force exercise planners will ensure
     compliance with AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) for
     all Air Force-sponsored exercises. Exercises conducted at Department of Defense (DoD)
     installations in foreign countries will comply with AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program
     in Foreign Countries.

       1.3.4.5. Contractor Support for Exercises. The contract statement of work is the source
       document for contractor duties and responsibilities. Contractor support for exercises
       must be confined to the services specified by contract or negotiated during the exercise
       planning process.
       1.3.4.6. Status of Forces Agreement for Combined Exercises. Whenever USAF forces
       participate with other countries in any combined exercise, the United States should have a
       status of forces agreement (SOFA) or similar arrangement with all participating
       countries. If a SOFA does not exist with any country, such an agreement should be
       negotiated and concluded in advance of the exercise in accordance with DoD Directive
       (DoDD) 5530.3, International Agreements, AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding,
       Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements, and AFJI 51-706, Status of Forces
       Policies, Procedures, and Information. If in doubt as to the existence of such an
       agreement with regard to a particular country or for assistance in preparing an agreement,
       contact Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the General Counsel, Deputy General
       Counsel for International Affairs (SAF/GCI).
    1.3.5. Exercise Management. The Air Force will develop the following products and use
    the following organizations to optimize exercise support and participation.
       1.3.5.1. Exercise Management Products.
          1.3.5.1.1. Weight of Effort (WoE). The WoE is a prioritized scoring matrix
          developed to assist Air Force senior leaders in making personnel and equipment
          apportionment decisions for exercise support functions, such as Air and Space
          Operations Center (AOC) augmentation, exercise control group support, and
          modeling and simulation (M&S) support. The WoE utilizes quantitative grading
          criteria to identify which exercises provide the greatest training benefit for USAF
          units. The WoE is not intended to be used for prioritization of funding.
          1.3.5.1.2. Global Exercise Schedule (GES). The GES is the annual schedule of
          exercises requiring support from Air Force exercise control and M&S organizations.
          Air Combat Command (ACC) develops and maintains the GES.
       1.3.5.2. Exercise Management Organizations.
          1.3.5.2.1. Air Force Joint Exercise Coordination Team (AFJECT). The AFJECT is
          an action officer-level working group responsible for developing a validated GES.
          Additional guidance is at Attachment 2.
          1.3.5.2.2. Exercise Integrated Process Team (EIPT). The EIPT is a multi-command,
          colonel-level organization responsible for coordinating and addressing cross-
          MAJCOM exercise issues and developing the WoE. Additional guidance is at
          Attachment 3.
          1.3.5.2.3. Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGOSG). The EGOSG is an
          executive level forum to address exercise-related issues and AF support to CSAF,
          Combatant Commander (CCDR), and MAJCOM/CC exercise requirements and
          priorities. Additional guidance is at Attachment 4.
    1.3.6. National Exercise Program (NEP). DoD Components will support the NEP in
    accordance with DoDI 3020.47, DoD Participation in the National Exercise Program (NEP).
AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                  9


      1.3.6.1. Scope. The NEP is run by the Department of Homeland Security and provides a
      framework for prioritizing and focusing Federal exercise activities. It is the principal
      mechanism for examining the overall preparedness of the United States Government
      (USG) and enables Federal departments and agencies to examine and evaluate national
      policies, plans, and strategies during the management of domestic catastrophic events,
      such as CBRN incidents, as a result of attack or natural disaster.
      1.3.6.2. Tiers. The NEP Implementation Plan categorizes exercises into the following
      tiers that reflect priorities for interagency participation:
          1.3.6.2.1. Tier I. This is the highest priority level. Tier I exercises are centered on
          White House directed, USG-wide issues and require the participation of appropriate
          department and agency principals along with their operations centers and staffs.
          1.3.6.2.2. Tier II. These are Federal department/agency exercises with a focus on
          USG strategy, policy, and procedural issues meriting priority for national and
          regional Federal interagency participation. Each department or agency will determine
          their level of actual or simulated support for NEP Tier II exercises.
          1.3.6.2.3. Tier III. These are other Federal exercises focused on plans, policies and
          procedures at the regional, operational, or tactical level not requiring broad
          interagency headquarters-level involvement. Participation at the national level is at
          the discretion of each department or agency.
          1.3.6.2.4. Tier IV. These are exercises in which State and local government, and/or
          private sector entities are the primary exercise audience.
      1.3.6.3. National Level Exercise (NLE). The NLE is the single annual operations-based
      NEP Tier I exercise and requires the participation of all appropriate department and
      agency principals.
      1.3.6.4. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) serves as the DoD POC to the
      NEP and orchestrates overall DoD NEP execution.
          1.3.6.4.1. The Air Force will participate in NEP Tier I exercises when appropriate
          given the scenario or when tasked by either the ASD (HD&ASA) or by CJCS or his
          or her representative.
          1.3.6.4.2. Unless directed by higher authority, Air Force participation in Tier II, III,
          and IV NEP exercises is at the discretion of MAJCOM and unit leadership.
          1.3.6.4.3. A tasked MAJCOM will notify AF/A3O-ATT and the requesting agency
          when they cannot provide requested exercise support to any NEP exercise.
      1.3.6.5. AF/A3O-ATT will monitor Air Force participation in NEP exercises.
      1.3.6.6. Air Force organizations that participate in a NEP exercise will:
          1.3.6.6.1. Fully support exercise planning, execution, and evaluation.
          1.3.6.6.2. Provide trusted agents, as needed, to design and control the exercise.
1.4. Nuclear Exercises.

     1.5.4.5.4. (Added-AFISRA) Delegated Planning (DP).
        1.5.4.5.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) Definitions for Levels of Planning Authorities.
           1.5.4.5.4.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Normal           Operations.    Under      normal
           operating conditions, exercise planning authority resides with AFISRA/A3XY
           who is responsible for the overall achievement of the exercise program’s
           mission/vision/goals/objectives through the development of an effective
           Exercise Engagement Plan (EEP) for each specific JCS or non-JCS exercise
           event. AFISRA will determine composition of the exercise planning team
           (planners vs. subject matter experts (SMEs)) for the specific exercise and
           provide direction and guidance on conference attendance, tasks, and manning
           solution validation. During conference attendance, A3XY will be lead
           planner and will orchestrate actions of the planning team such that all required
           “syndicates”, working groups, planning bodies, etc., are covered and
           subsequent information gleaned is captured at an end of day back brief.
           PCRR and AAR reporting flows through groups, wings/centers and is
AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                               13


             consolidated at each level until HQs publishes the final comprehensive
             document.
             1.5.4.5.4.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) Delegated Planning Representative (DPR).
             Under DPR, conference attendance by A3XY is foreseen as improbable.
             Planning authority/oversight functions are still required and retained by
             A3XY (EEP development, planning team, manning validation, etc); however,
             they will be performed distantly via electronic/telephonic means. Each
             organizational      planner/SME         is    representing     their     respective
             organization/capability and will work diligently to integrate their unit
             effectively into the exercise (i.e., training goals, objectives, etc.) and work in
             concert with sister units to further the Agency exercise mission/vision.
             During the conduct of the conference, A3XY requires periodic check-ins from
             the attending organizations to monitor activity and direct any specific actions
             or vectors (email or phone). Sourcing solutions can be developed/coordinated
             by the respective organizations, but still require HHQs validation.
             PCRR/AAR reporting is same as under Normal Operations.
             1.5.4.5.4.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) Full Delegated Planning Authority (DPA).
             Full DPA entails the delegation of overall oversight and responsibility to a
             subordinate Agency organization and provides that designee the authority to
             direct the exercise planning actions of the members of that specific exercise
             team. It provides authority for the DPA to task and leverage requirements on
             Agency organizations worldwide with potential support requirements for the
             specific exercise. Delegated Planning Authority (DPA) can only be executed
             by decision of A3XY and A3 leadership. DPA will be executed early in the
             exercise planning process when foreseeable issues will preclude the direct
             involvement of A3XY in the exercise planning process, or the exercise (or
             Agency participation) is of such limited scope that it would be in the best
             interest of that particular exercise that one organization assumes responsibility
             for planning and executing. DPA will be pre-coordinated with the designated
             organization and formalized by both official message traffic and email to the
             designated organization and all potential exercise team members. A3XY will
             still act as the ultimate arbitrator or conflict resolution authority if required.
             The DPA will be responsible for the following: coordinating and overseeing
             AFISRA participation in the delegated exercise planning conferences;
             maintaining a continuity folder for the exercise (see paragraph 1.5.4.5.2.9);
             receiving and reviewing exercise reports (PCRRs, AARs, and L2s) and
             providing them to A3XY for review and posting on the SIPRNET webpage.
          1.5.4.5.4.2. (Added-AFISRA) Functions never delegated:
             1.5.4.5.4.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) A3XY retains financial authority regardless
             of which planning authority schema implemented.
             1.5.4.5.4.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) By virtue of its process position in the Joint
             Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) through the use of the
             Defense Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES), HQ
             AFISRA can be the only “validator” of sourcing solutions.

                                          Chapter 2

                                     EXERCISE CYCLE

2.1. Exercise Cycle. The exercise cycle consists of the planning, execution, and evaluation
phases needed to create, conduct and assess an exercise.
2.2. Planning Phase. The planning phase encompasses all aspects of building an exercise and
as a minimum should address the following areas:
   2.2.1. Exercise concept. The exercise concept guides and focuses the planning effort. It
   identifies the exercise type (e.g. command post exercise (CPX), field training exercise (FTX),
   etc.), the major participants, the level of exercise play, the broad scenario profile and the
   plans, procedures, and activities that are the primary exercise focus.
   2.2.2. Exercise objectives. Exercise objectives are the precise, action-oriented statements
   that identify the goals for the exercise. Objectives should be developed around tasks from
   applicable Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs). When participating in linked exercises,
   Air Force exercise objectives should be compatible with those of the other exercise(s).
   2.2.3. Exercise plans (EXPLANs). EXPLANs should typically follow the standard
   Operations Plan (OPLAN) format found in CJCSM 3122.03C, Joint Operation Planning and
   Execution System (JOPES), Vol II--Planning Formats and Guidance, and contain pertinent
   annexes. When appropriate, participating Air Force organizations (HAF, MAJCOM, etc)
   will assist the exercise sponsor with EXPLAN development. Depending on exercise
   complexity, duration and level of participation, Air Force organizations may, at their
   discretion, create an organizational EXPLAN to clarify exercise requirements and
   responsibilities.
   2.2.4. Exercise control. Exercise execution is managed by controllers who are
   knowledgeable in the timing and content of exercise events. Air Force planners should
   determine the number and location of control elements and the exercise control procedures
   needed to provide overall exercise management and support the accomplishment of Air Force
   objectives. Planners should prepare and provide exercise controllers the support materials
   needed to manage exercise execution.
   2.2.5. Training. Exercises are a training program adjunct and provide an opportunity to
   practice trained actions and procedures during simulated situations in a controlled
   environment. Exercise organizations must determine the training their exercise players
   require to properly prepare them for a particular exercise and then ensure the training is
   accomplished before the exercise.
   2.2.6. Exercise Player Materials. One of the goals of the exercise program is to practice,
   validate, and reinforce established procedures. To help support this goal, whenever possible,
   exercise information should be communicated using established procedures. Exercise-
   specific player materials should only be created when normal communication tools or
   procedures do not exist to provide required exercise information.
       2.2.6.1. Exercise player material must not divulge trusted agent information or release
       any event information before the scheduled time of the event.
20                           AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


  2.2.7. Master Scenario Event List (MSEL). Typically, the MSEL is a chronological
  database of planned events and expected player actions that exercise controllers use to
  manage and guide the exercise to achieve exercise objectives.
     2.2.7.1. The MSEL is the scenario game plan for the exercise and should only be
     accessible to trusted agents and must not be released to exercise players.
     2.2.7.2. The exercise sponsoring organization is responsible for directing and overseeing
     MSEL development and creating and maintaining the MSEL database.
        2.2.7.2.1. Trusted agents from participating Air Force organizations will review the
        MSEL and ensure planned events support Air Force objectives.
            2.2.7.2.1.1. Air Force planners will coordinate on events that require Air Force
            participation and, when appropriate, create or change events to meet Air Force
            exercise requirements.
            2.2.7.2.1.2. When necessary, planners will attend MSEL Development and/or
            Synchronization Conferences to oversee scenario development and execution
            coordination.
 2.2.8. Trusted Agents. Trusted agents are subject matter experts who are given advance
 knowledge of exercise scenario details for the purpose of assisting with exercise development
 and planning.
     2.2.8.1. To maintain the integrity of exercise information, organizations should limit the
     number of trusted agents to the absolute minimum required to support proper planning.
        2.2.8.1.1. To maintain exercise planning continuity, trusted agents should be capable
        of serving from the start of exercise planning through execution.
        2.2.8.1.2. Trusted agents should not be principal players during exercise execution
        since advance knowledge of exercise events can significantly decrease the benefit
        players receive from an exercise.
     2.2.8.2. As a minimum, trusted agent information is For Official Use Only and should
     remain close-hold within the exercise planning community. Exercise information should
     not be released outside the planning community without the approval of the primary
     planning staff of the sponsoring organization for an exercise.
 2.2.9. Exercise planners. Planners must be knowledgeable in the procedures, plans, and
 processes being exercised.
     2.2.9.1. The following references provide detailed information on the Joint Training
     System (JTS) and the Joint Event Life Cycle (JELC) and can assist exercise planners in
     the design, conduct and evaluation of exercises:
        2.2.9.1.1. CJCSI 3500.01E, Joint Training Policy and Guidance for the Armed
        Forces of the United States.
        2.2.9.1.2. CJCSI 3500.02, Universal Joint Task List Policy and Guidance for the
        Armed Forces of the United States.
        2.2.9.1.3. CJCSM 3500.03B, Joint Training Manual (JTM) for the Armed Forces of
        the United States.
AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                 21


   2.2.10. Observers. Observers are a vital link in the exercise process. They ensure exercise
   objectives are met, provide on-the-spot instruction and capture lessons learned and/or best
   practices for the after-action report and inclusion in the Joint Lessons Learned Information
   System (JLLIS). They can also recommend and coordinate event changes when required
   during exercise execution.
   2.2.11. Communication and Testing. Communication Setup and Testing are important
   exercise preparation steps and should include validation of all certifications and
   accreditations, end-to-end communications checks, and systems interoperability verification.
2.3. Execution Phase. The formal execution phase begins with deployment of exercise
participants or STARTEX and continues until ENDEX.
   2.3.1. Controllers manage the direction, pace, and intensity of exercise play in accordance
   with the exercise control plan established by the exercise sponsoring organization.
       2.3.1.1. When required, an Air Force Exercise Control Group (AFECG) will oversee and
       manage the exercise activity of Air Force exercise participants.
          2.3.1.1.1. The AFECG will not include exercise players and will be tailored to
          support the size and scope of the exercise and meet the exercise needs of participating
          Air Force organizations.
       2.3.1.2. White Cell. Since all organizations do not participate in every exercise, White
       Cell personnel will replicate the actions or inputs of non-participating organizations that
       are needed to keep exercise activities on track. White Cell personnel will not be exercise
       players but are trusted agents and may also perform controller functions.
   2.3.2. Exercise Reporting. Exercises provide an opportunity to practice procedures and
   evaluate their effectiveness. All exercise participants, to include observers and controllers,
   should note strengths and weaknesses encountered in any area during exercise planning or
   execution and identify these using the prescribed lessons learned and after actions processes.
2.4. Evaluation Phase. The evaluation phase is a critical part of the exercise process and
enables participants to evaluate and assess exercise actions, propose changes, and share this
information with others. After Action Reports (AARs) and Lessons Learned (L2) actions are
key elements of this phase.
   2.4.1. AARs. Participating Air Force organizations should develop an AAR that
   summarizes exercise activities, evaluates actions, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and
   makes recommendations, as appropriate.
       2.4.1.1. Participating Air Force organizations will follow the guidance in AFI 90-1601,
       Air Force Lessons Learned Program, for posting and forwarding AARs.
   2.4.2. Lessons Learned. The Air Force Office of Lessons Learned (AF/A9L) is the OPR
   for the Air Force Lessons Learned Process (AFL2P).
       2.4.2.1. Unless otherwise directed by exercise protocols, all participating Air Force units
       will comply with the observation, collection, reporting, validation, dissemination, and
       tracking procedures contained in AFI 90-1601.

  2.4.3. The    Air      Force    Joint     Lessons    Learned Information System
  (https://www.jllis.mil/USAF) is the Air Force and DoD system of record for the
  management of all Air Force observations, L2, and AARs.
  2.4.4. (Added-AFISRA) AARs and L2. AFISRA directly supported wing/center/group
  exercise OPRs will consolidate and forward AARs and L2 to AFISRA/A3XY NLT 25
  calendar days after end of exercise (ENDEX). See Attachment 8 of this supplement for AAR
  format. The reports will include positive and negative information, results of preliminary
  exercise evaluation, and L2 inputs.

   3.2.1. The CE2 account provides funds for the following types of exercise activities:
      3.2.1.1. Incremental Expenses. CE2 provides Service Incremental Funding (SIF) to pay
      for the incremental O&M activities incurred solely for, or as a direct result of, planning
      for or taking part in a CE2-funded exercise. Valid incremental activities include such
      items as lodging, per diem, non-aviation fuel, consumable supplies, contract support, and
      communications. It does not include costs funded in other AF accounts, such as flying
      hours.
      3.2.1.2. Transportation. Exercise transportation includes airlift, sealift, Port Handling
      (PH), Inland Transportation (IT), and the Commercial Ticket Program (CTP).
      Transportation funding generally covers the cost of transporting personnel and equipment
      from a unit’s home station to the exercise area and return. Commercial air travel from
      home station to and from the aerial port of embarkation (APOE), however, is a Service
      responsibility. Active duty, ANG, and AFRC forces can receive CE2 Transportation
      funds.
          3.2.1.2.1. Port Handling (PH). Port handling includes commercial contract expenses
          to receive or dispatch cargo for an exercise at Port of Embarkation (POE) and Port of
          Debarkation (POD) associated with Military Sealift Command (MSC) for sealift and
          Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) for commercial shipping.
          PH expenses include documentation, terminal handling, and stevedoring.
          3.2.1.2.2. Inland Transportation (IT). Inland transportation funds purchase approved
          point-to-point transportation service associated with the movement of exercise
          participants and cargo, between the units’ home base/installation to and from a
          POE/POD and to or from the exercise area, by commercial-for-hire firms when
          organic transportation is not available or cost effective. Movement is by surface
          transportation (rail, highway, and inland waterway).          Using vehicles where
          commercial drivers are included in the lease/ticket price is permissible. The leasing
          of commercial vehicles (e.g., passenger vans), however, is specifically excluded and
 24                           AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


         should not be confused with commercial-for-hire firms, including bus lines.
         Transportation expenses associated with temporary duty, exercise conferences, and
         air travel are specifically excluded from IT funding.
         3.2.1.2.3. Commercial Ticket Program (CTP). This program supports individual
         commercial air travel during exercise execution when military airlift or commercial
         air charter cannot satisfy the sponsoring command’s transportation requirements.
         CTP is used only when United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)-
         provided common-user transportation cannot satisfy the CCDR-validated exercise
         Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD). CTP funds can only be used to
         purchase commercial airline tickets. CTP funds do not cover per diem or movement
         to the APOE or from the APOD. Once CTP requirements are determined for a
         particular exercise, USTRANSCOM will post the CTP authorization message on their
         Single Mobility System (SMS) website.
   3.2.2. AF/A3O-ATT is responsible for managing the disbursement of CE2 funds associated
   with Air Force participation in JEP exercises.
      3.2.2.1. Funding for JEP exercises is based on requirements identified in the Joint
      Training Information Management System (JTIMS). Exercise sponsors, planners, and
      participants should ensure the accurate and timely entry of required JTIMS data.
      3.2.2.2. AF/A3O-ATT will use Emergency and Special Project (ESP) codes to track CE2
      expenditures by exercise. To facilitate exercise expenditure accounting, Air Force
      organizations will ensure that all exercise fund cites contain the proper ESP code.
3.3. CE2 Funds Management.
   3.3.1. PH/IT Funds.
      3.3.1.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation and distribution of PH/IT
      funds.
      3.3.1.2. Transportation Account Codes (TAC). MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should use
      TACs to fund PH/IT requirements whenever possible. When a TAC is not viable,
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will request PH/IT funding per paragraph 3.3.1.3.
      3.3.1.3. Funding Request. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU exercise planners will send a PH/IT
      funding request to AF/A3O-ATT (afa3oatt.workflow@pentagon.af.mil) as soon as the
      PH/IT need is known. The PH/IT funding request will include the exercise name,
      number of passengers and/or total weight of cargo (in short tons), and the estimated cost.
         3.3.1.3.1. AF/A3O-ATT will forward the PH/IT request to JS/J7 (JEXD). The JS
         Comptroller will post the funds on the Program Budget Accounting System (PBAS)
         for the respective MAJCOM/FOA/DRU.             MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs are then
         responsible for getting funds to the appropriate units and for tracking PH/IT
         obligations by exercise name and ESP code.
   3.3.2. CTP Funds.
      3.3.2.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation and distribution of CTP
      funds.
AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                              25


       3.3.2.2. Funding Request. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit their CTP requests IAW
       AF/A3O-ATT-issued guidance.
          3.3.2.1.1. JS/J7 will process CTP requests and distribute CTP funds IAW the most
          current JS/J7 Joint Exercise Transportation Program, Commercial Ticket Program
          Implementation Guidance.
   3.3.3. SIF Funds.
       3.3.3.1. AF/A3O-ATT will oversee the distribution of                 SIF   funds    and
       MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation of SIF funds.
       3.3.3.2. Funding Request.    MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will follow SIF procedures in
       paragraph 3.5.
   3.3.4. CE2 funds are authorized to support specific approved exercise expenses and may not
   be redirected to fund any other activities. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs must track PH/IT, CTP,
   and SIF obligations separately.
3.4. Exercise Funds Responsibilities.
   3.4.1. JEP Exercises.
       3.4.1.1. AF/A3O-ATT is the AF OPR for managing CE2-supplied SIF.
       3.4.1.2. JS/J-7 (JEXD) is the OPR for managing CE2-supplied PH, IT, and CTP funds.
       AF/A3O-ATT will coordinate consolidated AF requests for these funds to JS by exercise.
       3.4.1.3. All AF organizations will comply with JCS exercise funding guidance in AFI
       65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Table 10.3.
   3.4.2. Non-JEP Exercises. Air Force organizations conducting unilateral or other joint
   exercises not within the approved JEP must fund these exercises from their own O&M
   accounts. For Air Force-sponsored non-JEP exercises, the MAJCOM or Air Force
   organization sponsoring an exercise is generally responsible for funding the exercise.
   3.4.3. Combined Exercises. Combined exercises should have a written arrangement with
   the foreign participant(s) that includes the authority for the exercise, the scope of the
   exercise, status of US personnel (paragraph 1.3.4.6), and funding procedures, as
   appropriate. Any US training provided to participating countries should be handled under
   available legal authority, such as by a foreign military sales (FMS) case or cross-servicing
   agreement under Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authority.
3.5. HAF Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Process for Service
Incremental Funding (SIF).
   3.5.1. During the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development process,
   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit their Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) SIF
   requirements for JEP exercises to AF/A3O-ATT.
       3.5.1.1. AF/A3O-ATT will consolidate Air Force requirements and submit the Air Force
       SIF request to OUSD(P&R).
       3.5.1.2. OUSD(P&R) incorporates AF SIF requirements into the overall Defense-wide
       CE2 request as part of the President’s Budget (PB).
 26                              AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


   3.5.2. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act establishes the amount of CE2 funds
   appropriated for the upcoming execution year. Congress must approve and the President
   must sign this act for funds to be available. If the appropriations act is not signed before the
   beginning of the execution year, funding is generally available under a continuing resolution.
   3.5.3. OUSD(P&R) will determine AF SIF funding for the current execution year and
   publish this information as part of the CE2 Program Execution Plan (PEP). Once the AF SIF
   allocation is known, AF/A3O-ATT will provide execution year fiscal guidance to AF
   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs.
         3.5.3.1. If a MAJCOM/FOA/DRU encounters an unanticipated SIF requirement during
         the current fiscal year, the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU should notify AF/A3O-ATT of the
         requirement. The notification should include sufficient explanation to justify a request
         for additional funds. If AF/A3O-ATT cannot fund the requirement from existing AF SIF
         resources, when deemed appropriate, they will submit an Unfunded Requirement to the
         Joint Staff for additional funds from the CE2 Program.
         3.5.3.2. AF SIF must only be obligated to fund valid JEP exercise activities.
         MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should notify AF/A3O-ATT when they have excess SIF funds.
         Ultimately, SIF funds not needed to support AF exercise participation requirements revert
         back to OUSD(P&R) control for reallocation against other CE2 program requirements.
3.6. Tracking and Reporting.
      3.6.1. PH/IT and CTP funds are distributed per the procedures in paragraphs 3.3.1 and
      3.3.2 respectively. SIF funds are distributed per AF/A3O-ATT-issued fiscal guidance.
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will track transportation funds (Z5 funds) sub-allocated from the
      Joint Staff.
         3.6.1.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should track all JEP expenditures using assigned ESP
         codes. Questions concerning the use of ESP codes should be addressed to AF/A3O-ATT.
   3.6.2. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit monthly SIF obligation reports to AF/A3O-ATT
   by the third working day of the following month.
         3.6.2.1. AF/A3O-ATT will submit a consolidated SIF obligation report to OUSD(P&R)
         within the first week of the month following the report month.
   3.6.3. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit monthly obligation reports (Flash Reports) for
   funds sub-allocated from the Joint Staff. Flash Reports will be submitted to the Joint Staff
   Comptroller with info to AF/A3O-ATT by the third working day of the following month.
3.7. Funding for Aerial Refueling of Foreign Aircraft during Combined Exercises.
   3.7.1. USAF tankers flying aerial refueling missions to exclusively support US aircraft
   during combined exercises can also refuel foreign aircraft on the same mission provided the
   following conditions are met:
         3.7.1.1. Refueling of foreign aircraft is conducted on a strictly opportune, non-
         interference basis.
         3.7.1.2. Exercise tanker missions are scheduled based on supporting US exercise mission
         requirements only.
AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                                 27


     3.7.1.3. Tanker loiter time is not added to exercise tanker missions simply to
     accommodate non-exercise refueling operations.
     3.7.1.4. Foreign governments must pay for the fuel offloaded in accordance with USAF
     instructions and procedures (for example, pursuant to the terms of a reciprocal fuels
     agreement, cross-servicing agreement, or FMS case).
  3.7.2. If the foreign aircraft refueling operation does not increase the required flying time of
  the planned exercise-only refueling mission, the foreign government must only pay for the
  offloaded fuel.
     3.7.2.1. If the foreign aircraft refueling takes place outside the “envelope” for meeting
     USAF mission requirements and time is added to the planned exercise refueling mission
     to support foreign aircraft refueling operations, the foreign government must also pay for
     the additional flying hours along with the offloaded fuel.
  3.7.3. When a combined exercise utilizes USAF tankers to refuel foreign aircraft as part of
  the exercise, the refueling of foreign aircraft can be conducted on a less than full cost
  reimbursement basis provided that:
     3.7.3.1. The purpose of the combined exercise is to employ coalition force concepts of
     operations that require USAF aerial refueling of foreign aircraft in support of DoD
     mission requirements;
     3.7.3.2. The primary MAJCOM/A3 supporting the exercise approves of conducting the
     refueling on a less than full cost reimbursement basis;
     3.7.3.3. The primary MAJCOM/A3 supporting the exercise notifies AF/A3O-AT and
     AMC/FMF with a command coordinated memorandum specifying the aerial refueling
     operations that will be conducted on a less than full cost reimbursement basis. The
     memorandum should be submitted NLT 30 days prior to the exercise and include:
         3.7.3.3.1. A description of the operation, including objectives;
         3.7.3.3.2. The US mission requirements to be satisfied;
         3.7.3.3.3. A list of expenses to be assumed by the DoD and the funding source;
         3.7.3.3.4. A list of expenses to be assumed by the foreign government, including
         method of payment to DoD for required reimbursements.
  3.7.4. If the foreign aircraft aerial refueling does not meet the criteria set forth in
  paragraphs 3.7.1 or 3.7.3., aerial refueling must be conducted on a full reimbursement basis.
  The foreign government must pay for all applicable costs, such as offloaded fuel,
  boom/drogue time, tanker transit time, and loiter time.
  3.7.5. Foreign Aerial Refueling Requirements.
     3.7.5.1. Foreign receiver pilots and commercial and foreign tanker crews participating in
     aerial refueling operations during exercise missions involving USAF tankers or receivers
     must be qualified in and use USAF aerial refueling terminology and procedures as
     specified in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Allied Tactical Publication
     (ATP)-56(B),                 Air              to              Air             Refuelling
     (http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/airtoair56b.cfm).
 28                            AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


          3.7.5.1.1. Per ATP-56(B), qualified foreign pilots and commercial and foreign boom
          operators must meet aerial refueling currency requirements or adhere to published re-
          currency procedures.
          3.7.5.1.2. Exercise aerial refueling missions will not be used to qualify or requalify
          foreign receiver pilots, or commercial or foreign boom operators as this is the
          provision of a defense service to the foreign country that requires a FMS case or
          cross-servicing agreement under ACSA authority, as appropriate (see DoDD
          5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), Chapter 10.5).
      3.7.5.2. Tanker and receiver aircraft operated commercially or by foreign nations must
      be certified as technically compatible for aerial refueling operations with USAF receiver
      and tanker aircraft. Information about foreign receiver aircraft that are technically
      compatible with USAF tankers, commercial and foreign tankers that are technically
      compatible with USAF receivers, and instructions for requesting a technical compatibility
      assessment are published in ATP-56(B), Annex Z, US National Annex.
3.8. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA Exercise Program Budget. AFISRA/A3XY manages the
budget for the AFISRA Exercise Program. The budget consists of two separate funding lines:
JCS exercises and non-JCS exercises.
   3.8.1. (Added-AFISRA) JCS Exercise Funds.
      3.8.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA/A3XY annually submits AFISRA’s funding
      requirements for JCS exercises to Air Staff (USAF/A3OT). Once the fiscal year defense
      budget has been approved, USAF/A3OT allocates AFISRA funding for JCS exercises.
      AFISRA/A3XY, in turn, coordinates with AFISRA/FMA to allocate the funds to
      AFISRA directly supported wings/centers/groups. AFISRA/A3XY will notify the
      directly supported wing/center/group OPRs the amount of their allotment and at that
      point it will be the OPRs’ responsibility to manage the expenditure of those funds. All
      JCS costs must be funded in FC 2M, and properly Emergency and Special Program
      (ESP) coded. ESP codes for JCS exercises can be accessed through the Air Force Portal
      on the SAF/FMB web site at https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/. Obligations that are not
      recorded in FC 2M or have improper ESP codes will not be considered a valid obligation
      for tracking, reporting, or reimbursement purposes. Funds are fenced for JCS exercise
      support only and cannot be reprogrammed to other requirements. Monthly expenditure
      reports are required to be sent to the AFISRA/A3XY exercise budget manager.
      3.8.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA units are authorized to use JCS funds for costs
      incurred solely for exercise planning conferences. Actual costs for exercises are to be
      funded by the exercise host. Exceptions to these rules must be approved in advance by
      AFISRA/A3XY.
   3.8.2. (Added-AFISRA) Non-JCS Exercise Funds.
   3.8.3. (Added-AFISRA) Un-programmed Exercises. AFISRA organizations incurring
   costs associated with planning for a JCS or Non-JCS exercise without a programmed ESP
   Code must coordinate with AFISRA/A3XY for appropriate funding.
   3.8.4. (Added-AFISRA) Deployment Orders. Subordinate organizations participating in
   an exercise will deploy using Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment (CED) orders for
AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011                                               29


  exercise deployment, execution, and redeployment. The Personnel Readiness Function
  (PRF) within the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) generates CED orders based on guidance
  received from the exercise host. Use of regular squadron level Temporary Duty orders to
  participate in an exercise is not authorized, unless prior approval has been arranged with the
  sponsor.
  3.8.5. (Added-AFISRA) Annual Exercise Cost Projection. At the end of each Fiscal
  Year, AFISRA/A3XY is required to submit a five-year budget plan to Air Staff for JCS
  exercises. At that time, AFISRA/A3XY will issue a call for AFISRA directly supported
  wings/centers/groups to analyze future exercise schedules and provide their five-year cost
  estimates. AFISRA/A3XY will consolidate all AFISRA inputs into a five-year plan and
  submit it to Air Staff.

          AIR FORCE JOINT EXERCISE COORDINATION TEAM (AFJECT)

A2.1. Overview. This attachment outlines the organization, responsibilities and procedures for
the AFJECT and describes the process for developing the Global Exercise Schedule (GES).
ACC/A3J Division Chief is the AFJECT Chairperson and delegated authority to coordinate
USAF support for joint and USAF service-level training events to include Flag exercises, Joint
National Training Center (JNTC) events and functional command events.
A2.2. Objective. The objective of the AFJECT is to coordinate, schedule, and deconflict, as
required, the Air Force Air & Space Operations Center (AOC), Control and Reporting Center
(CRC), Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), 505th Command and Control Wing (505 CCW),
assets assigned by the EIPT and any other MAJCOM units/assets used to support USAF,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), COCOM-sponsored and other MAJCOM
exercises and experiments. The AFJECT uses the GES to accomplish this task.
A2.3. Organization.
   A2.3.1. The AFJECT is an action officer (AO) level working group made up of exercise
   planners, schedulers and support staff from the member organizations listed in Para 3.3. and
   chaired by the ACC/A3J Division Chief. The Chairman is the spokesperson for the AFJECT
   and approves all team decisions.
   A2.3.2. The AFJECT will submit a coordinated and validated GES to the Exercise
   Integrated Process Team (EIPT) and Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGOSG), in
   turn, for approval. This approval chain will also be used to address unresolved exercise
   support issues that occur during the GES development process. If required, MAJCOM
   representatives can also engage the EIPT or EGOSG to reclama exercise scheduling conflicts
   or other AFJECT decisions. In all cases, issues will be resolved at the lowest appropriate
   level.
   A2.3.3. Membership. As a minimum, the following organizations will have representatives
   on the AFJECT:
       A2.3.3.1. ACC
       A2.3.3.2. PACAF (AFPAC)
       A2.3.3.3. USAFE (AFEUR)

      A2.3.3.13. 8AF (AFSTRAT)
      A2.3.3.14. 9AF (AFCENT)
      A2.3.3.15. 12AF (AFSOUTH)

      A2.3.3.21. 505 CCW
      A2.3.3.22. Representatives from other organizations may attend and participate with
      prior approval from the AFJECT Chairperson.
A2.4. AFJECT Process:
   A2.4.1. AFJECT Conferences. The AFJECT will hold up to two conferences per year.
   The first conference, normally held in the Spring, will prioritize and deconflict, as required,
   the next year’s exercise and experiment schedules. It is normally scheduled NLT 90 days
   after the Spring Joint Staff (JS) Worldwide Joint Training and Scheduling Conference
   (WJTSC). The second conference, normally held in the Fall, will address the exercise
   schedule for the ensuing 18-24 months, provide exercise related updates and address any
   emerging issues. This second conference will typically use video teleconference (VTC)
   capabilities to minimize travel requirements and encourage maximum participation.
   A2.4.2. Global Exercise Schedule (GES) Preparation.
      A2.4.2.1. The GES is developed in one-year increments. The AFJECT program
      manager will develop five years of exercise schedules and maintain them on the AFJECT
      Community of Practice (CoP) website.
      A2.4.2.2. MAJCOM program and functional managers will identify/establish their
      command exercise requirements and submit them to the AFJECT program manager NLT
      2 months prior to each biannual AFJECT conference for posting onto the CoP. Exercise
      planners will work with the AFJECT program manager to determine resource availability
      and coordinate specific support requirements.
      A2.4.2.3. Six weeks prior to each conference, AFJECT members will review the GES
      and identify the exercises their units are participating in and annotate the exercise support
      resources they are requesting for their events (i.e. exercise control group, AOC manning
      augmentation, etc.). Any changes to GES information must be submitted to the program
      manager NLT two weeks before the conference.
      A2.4.2.4. In preparation for the AFJECT conference, the AFJECT program manager will
      post all scheduling changes, build a draft schedule and develop the AFJECT briefing.
      Functional program managers will review the updated schedule to determine unit
      supportability. MAJCOM planners/schedulers should attempt to resolve exercise
 42                            AFI10-204_AFISRASUP_480ISRWSUP_I 22 MARCH 2011


       scheduling issues prior to the conference. Unresolved issues will be addressed during the
       conference.
          A2.4.2.4.1. Voluntary support to non-AFJECT scheduled events does not relieve a
          unit of the responsibility to support AFJECT scheduled requirements. Also, while the
          AFJECT does not schedule AFRC/ANG forces, AFRC and ANG units should utilize
          the GES to identify training and support opportunities.
       A2.4.2.5. Following the AFJECT conference, the program manager will draft the
       meeting minutes, update the GES, as required, and forward it to the EIPT and EGOSG, in
       turn, for approval. Once the GES is approved, the program manager will prepare the 505
       CCW tasking message for ACC/CV release.

480 ISR WG EXERCISE PROGRAM / MTP                                                  CAO: 4/8/2013

Preface
This Master Training Plan (MTP) is a comprehensive education and training document that
identifies life-cycle training/education and core task requirements for exercise planners on the
480 ISR WG Staff. Subordinate units will modify this MTP to satisfy their local training needs.

The 480 ISR WG Exercise Planner Master Training Plan consists of two parts; both parts are to
be used to plan, manage, and control training.

Part I will provide general information on how to use this plan.

Part II contains the Master Task List (MTL) and training timelines.

Using the guidance provided in the Wing Exercise Planner MTP will ensure individuals receive
effective and efficient training. This plan lays the foundation necessary for supervisors to ensure
their personnel are trained in a timely manner.


480 ISR WG EXERCISE PROGRAM / MTP                                                  CAO: 4/8/2013

Part 1

Purpose: This MTP provides the information necessary for supervisors to plan, develop,
manage, and conduct an effective 480 ISR WG Exercise Planner training program. This plan
outlines the training individuals should receive to become proficient exercise planners.
The MTP fulfills various functions to include the following:
–       Serves as a management tool enabling supervisors to plan, manage, and conduct an
effective training program for exercise planners.
–       Establishes training timelines for supervisors to follow ensuring training requirements are
implemented at appropriate times.
–       Identifies source of training.
AFI 36-2201 Chapter 6, Air Force Training Program, dated 15 September 2010 provides
guidance for supervisors, trainers, task certifiers and trainees on their responsibilities,
requirements and qualifications in regards to on-the-job training.


480 ISR WG EXERCISE PROGRAM / MTP                                            CAO: 4/8/2013

Note: Master Training List and timelines – the sections listed in the table below are derived
from the 480 ISR WG Exercise Planner Job Qualification Standards (AF IMT 797).
Timelines and training strategy for Wing Exercise Planners: Tasks No.1 and No. 2 should
be completed first and the remaining tasks can be completed in any particular order. Training
times are approximate and may be based upon resource availability. (NOTE: All tasks, except
#9, must be trained before the assigned person can be considered fully qualified).
Exercise Planning Tasks (From 480 ISR WG Exercise Planner JQS; CAO 26 May 2012)
