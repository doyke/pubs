SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include the organization to supplemental paragraphs throughout the AFI rather than just chapter
10. Other changed areas include new aircrew arming procedures, further defined Go/No-Go,
added Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) procedures, hearing protection, added SOV-3
approval, added rescue bin configuration, standard equipment list and flight engineer information
guide.

1.1. This supplement establishes local policies and procedures not otherwise readily available to
aircrew through aircrew publications. It promotes a safe, orderly and expeditious movement of
2                                     AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009

39 RQS aircraft. It does not apply when 39 RQS aircrew and aircraft experience a Change in
Operational Control (CHOP), however crews should comply with the intent as much as possible.

1.3.2. Waiver authority for AFI 11-2HC-130V3_920RQW Supplement (SUP) is the 920 OG/CC.
Submit waiver requests and revisions, in writing, to 39 RQS/DOV. Requests are forwarded to 39
RQS/CC and 920 OG/CC for approval.

5.8.3. (Added) Aircraft Lighting. Attachment 5 checklist page insert is for flight engineers and is
provided to ensure proper lighting configuration during all phases of aircraft operation. The
information therein has been extrapolated from AFI 11-202V3_Air Combat Command (ACC)
SUP, General Flight Rules, AFI 11-218_ACCSUP, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the
Ground, AFI 11-2HC-130V3, T.O.’s 1C-130(H)H-1, and 1-1C-1-20. This page is for
information only and should be placed outside the blue cover pages that enclose the T.O. 1C-
130(H) H-1CL-5 checklist pages.

5.8.3.1. (Added) Position Lights. These will be set to “flash” while on the ground and “steady”
during flight.

5.8.3.2. (Added) Anti-Collision/Strobe Lights. All 39 RQS aircraft are equipped with strobe
lights rather than a rotating beacon. Use of the strobe inhibit switch is applicable.

5.8.3.3. (Added) For normal aircraft operations, use the following guidance:

5.8.3.3.1. (Added) BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist. Position lights will be set to
FLASH, strobe lights to RED/WHITE (whichever is applicable), strobe inhibit switch to ANTI-
COLLISION.

5.8.3.3.2. (Added) LINEUP checklist. Position lights will be set to STEADY, strobe inhibit
switch to OFF. This enables strobe light operation.

5.8.3.3.3. (Added) AFTER LANDING checklist. The position lights will be set to FLASH,
strobe inhibit switch will be placed to ANTI-COLLISION.

5.8.3.3.4. (Added) For ACC HC-130 aircraft, red strobe lights should be used at night and white
strobes should be used during daylight.

6.2.7.2. (Added) Reflective belts will be worn on the flightline during hours of darkness.

6.2.9.1. (Added) The Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERK) is contained in a storage box
which is comprised of two sections. The HERK portion of the kit is located in the top half of the
storage box and the flight engineer’s tool kit is located in the bottom half. The box is located, just
behind the right paratroop door. It is marked for identification purposes and locked using a 4-
digit numerical combination type lock. If either kit is used, or the box is found to be open during
preflight, a complete inventory will be accomplished prior to leaving the work area. If any
component within the kit is missing, an annotation in the Air Force Technical Order (AFTO)
Form 781A will be made. This kit is the responsibility of the 39 RQS flight engineer’s.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009                                                        3

6.2.9.2. (Added) The HERK and procedures are intended for use in hostile/austere locations
where maintenance support is not available. Approval authority for the use of the HERK resides
in Air Force Special Operations Command Manual (AFSOCM) 11-201, Hostile Environment
Repair Procedures. Each kit will be accompanied by a kit bag containing the 3 wood plugs.
These items will be verified in place during the flight engineer’s aircraft preflight. In addition,
the flight engineer will also ensure that an alternating current generator pad and direct current
power cord are in place on the aircraft. These two items are the responsibility of the 920th
Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. (EXCEPTION: These items will normally be removed and
placed in storage when the aircraft is scheduled for entry into extended modification or
Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), Isochronal Inspection (ISO), etc. The flight engineer
will then sign out a fly-away PDM tool kit from the flight engineer superintendent.)

6.3. 39 RQS tracks all Flight Crew Information File (FCIF)s electronically with PATRIOT
EXCALIBUR (PEX).

6.3.3 (Added) Crewmembers without access to PEX (i.e. locked accounts or wrong passwords)
will follow FCIF sign off procedures in accordance with (IAW) paragraph 6.3.2 of the AFI in
which this supplements.

6.9. 39 RQS/DOK is responsible to maintain unit mission kits. The Airborne Mission Systems
Specialist (AMSS) will check the kit for completeness on each aircraft preflight.

6.9.1. The CANON IP90 color printer is available and approved for use during all phases of
flight and is intended to aid in dynamic changes in mission execution. The printers have been
assigned to each tail number. The printers and all associated hardware and accessories with the
exception of the universal serial bus (USB) cable and ink cartridges are stored in the aircraft
mission kit. These items are accounted for by serial number and assigned to individual tail
numbers. These printers use standard 8 ½” x 11” paper which is located in the front pocket of
each mission kit. Printer cartridges and USB cable are stored in three AMSS Footballs available
in the squadron. The cartridges should be removed from the printer after use due to extreme ramp
temperatures on the flightline. These printers and consumables are the responsibility of the 39
RQS/DOK.

6.10.6. (Added) 39 RQS/DOK is responsible to maintaining aircraft Navigation Kits. The AMSS
will check the kit for completeness on each aircraft preflight.

6.16.2 (Added) Filing Flight Plans.

6.16.2.1. (Added) Local visual flight rules (VFR) flight plans may be filed with Patrick AFB base
operations via telephone Defense Switched Network (DSN) 854-2222 and all instrument flight
rules (IFR) flight plans must be filed via facsimile (FAX) (DSN 854-6442). The aircraft
commander or designated representative will confirm the flight plan has been received. The filing
procedures are as follows:

6.16.2.2. (Added) Obtain local area weather (flimsy) from the 45th Weather Squadron homepage
(click on the Local Area Flying Forecast link). Contact the forecaster (DSN 853-8488) for
4                                     AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009

updates, initials or to request a Faxed copy of a Department of Defense (DD) Form 175-1, Flight
Weather Briefing, (Rescue Operations Center (ROC) FAX DSN 854-3245).

6.16.2.3. (Added) To telephonically file a local VFR flight plan, contact base operations and
provide the required information from the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan. Obtain the base
operations representative initials and annotate the notice to airman (NOTAM) block of the form.

6.19.1.4. (Added) Lightning Warning. Cape Weather issues two lightning warnings for Patrick
AFB. Phase I means that conditions are favorable for lighting within 5 nautical miles (NMs) of
Patrick AFB within 30 minutes. Phase I does not restrict any ground or flight operations. Phase
II means lightning is occurring or imminent within 5 NM of Patrick AFB or Melbourne
International Airport. Phase II restricts personnel from continuing flight line ground operations.
Phase II does not restrict aircraft taxiing to and from parking. Maintenance personnel will not be
available to marshal the aircraft into parking during this time; therefore the aircraft commander
will ensure proper taxi clearances are met. In addition, Instrument Approaches or VFR pattern
activity other than mission essential will not be authorized.

6.21.3.1. (Added) Upon completion of the aircraft preflight, the aircraft may be sealed for the
duration of the preflight period. In this case, an entry must be annotated in the AFTO Form 781A
to include the following statement: “Aircraft Flight Engineer (FE), Loadmaster (LM), and AMSS
preflights c/w IAW T.O.1C-130(H)H-1 at (local time). Aircraft sealed using seal # XXXX.” In
addition to this statement, the FE will add the current fuel and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) status. The
actual aircraft seal number must be written in ink. If at any time the aircraft seal is broken then
resealed, an annotation in the aircraft forms will be made stating the time, date, crewmembers
name and new aircraft seal.

6.21.7. (Added) The helicopter air refueling system and air deflector doors will be preflighted for
every initial preflight of the aircraft flying period. This meets the need for short notice/airborne
tasking. Preflight the flare launcher system for every off-station and local training mission
requiring its use.

6.21.8. (Added) When the airplane is flown more than once on the same day and assumed by a
replacement crew (warm turn), the flight engineer will check areas where maintenance or
servicing was performed, refit harness and oxygen quick-don mask, as well as perform a general
inspection of the aircraft. Attachment 4 provides a checklist page that can be used as a guide to
facilitate this warm turn inspection.

6.21.9. (Added) Crewmembers required to perform preflight will be given 12 hours of crew rest
prior to assuming preflight duties. Preflight duty that is not scheduled to result in flying a sortie
for that particular crewmember will not exceed a 12 hour shift from initial report time (including
civilian employment report time).

6.21.10. (Added) Duty not involving flying (DNIF) crewmembers or crewmembers non-current
for a Basic Sortie will not preflight aircraft.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009                                                        5

6.55. (Added) Aircraft commanders and flight engineers will attend the maintenance debrief at
Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) as soon as possible after a flight. In addition, a specific
discrepancy may require the attendance of the crewmember most affected by the malfunctioning
system. If MOC is unavailable, leave aircraft forms on the plane. FAX a copy of the AFTO
Form 781 to MOC at DSN 854-8870.

6.55.2.7. (Added) Activate the birdbath by clicking the transmitter 5 times within 7 seconds on
very high frequency (VHF) 148.45. Allow approximately one minute for the pressure to build up.
Repeated attempts will disable the birdbath. As full spray begins, start taxiing slowly on
centerline at a rate that allows adequate rinsing of the airframe. Exercise flight controls as water
washes them.

6.55.2.7.1. (Added) If the aircraft performed live ordinance dispensing, the aircraft must be
checked for hung ordnance prior to entering the bird bath. In this case, perform the ENGINE
RUNNING ON/OFFLOAD checklist to facilitate the loadmaster exiting then re-entering the
aircraft. (Reference 10.5.2.1. for specific loadmaster procedures.)

6.55.2.7.2. (Added) Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) equipped aircraft with
Small Laser Turret Assemblies (SLTA) installed will not proceed through the bird bath as water
intrusion may result in damage to sensors.

6.66.5. (Added) During ground operations, the aircrew will accomplish the engine running crew
change (ERCC) checklist anytime a primary crewmember is changing out of his/her primary crew
position, otherwise run the engine running onload/offload (ERO) checklist when not utilizing the
Infil/Exfil checklist. Coordinate the location of the ERO with participating aircrew members,
King Operations, and MOC.

6.66.5.1. (Added) Deplaning Crew: Ensure a sufficient number of SATBs and pyrotechnics for
both missions are delivered to the aircraft prior to initial takeoff. Also ensure the fuel load is
sufficient for both missions. Complete the weight and balance form and take off and land data
(TOLD) card for the enplaning crew. List all discrepancies in the Air Force Technical Order
AFTO Form 781A. The departing loadmaster will take the signed weight and balance form when
departing the aircraft.

6.66.5.2. (Added) Enplaning Crew: The oncoming aircraft commander will sign the weight and
balance form. The flight engineer/loadmaster will fit or stow parachute/restraint harness as
required. All crewmembers will discuss discrepancies with counterparts.

7.5.1.1. (Added) Aircrew Arming and Handling of Weapons. Normally, the loadmaster and
flight engineer will arm for all missions outside the contiguous United States (CONUS) or as
directed by the squadron commander. Other crewmembers may arm on a weapons availability
basis. Load M-9 pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition for anti-hijack purposes.

7.5.1.2.. (Added) Aircrew members must ensure they have the following items when receiving
weapons from 920th Operations Support Squadron (920 OSS) Life Support (Armory):
6                                   AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009

7.5.1.3.. (Added) Flight Authorization.

7.5.1.4. (Added) AF Form 522, Ground Weapons Training Data or AF Form 523, Authorization
to Bear Firearm.s

7.5.1.5. (Added) Correct size/type of holster or survival vest. A concealed holster must be used
when retrieving weapons for anti-hijacking purposes.

7.5.7. (Added) Turn-in aircrew weapons to 39 RQS Armory located in 920 OSS/Life Support
immediately upon return to home station. Staffing the armory for the return of aircrew weapons
will be coordinated a minimum of 24 hours prior to the aircrew’s return to home station by calling
DSN 854-2297 (King Operations) during normal duty hours. If 39 RQS personnel are
unavailable, crews may store weapons at the 45th Space Wing (45 SW) security police armory
(DSN 854-2000) on a temporary basis. The weapons must then be picked up from the police
armory and returned to the Life Support armory on the next business day. At no time will
personal vehicles be used to transport firearms. Use government vehicles to and from the armory.
All weapons will be returned cleared using a clearing barrel and stored in a sealed ammo can.
Ammo cans will contain the 2 M-9’s and 4 15-round magazines originally issued and be sealed
using a box car seal obtained from the armory prior to storage.

10.2. (Added) 39 RQS Local Operating Procedures

10.2.1. (Added) Avoid areas: Do not fly below 1,500’ above ground level (AGL) inside the
indicated radius of the points listed in Table 10.1.

Table 10.1. Areas to Avoid.
           POINT                           RADIUS                           REASON

AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009                                                         7

10.2.2.7. (Added) MacDill Aux Field (Avon Park), FL (KAGR)

10.2.2.8. (Added) Mayport Naval Station, FL (KNRB)

10.2.2.9. (Added) Melbourne International, FL (KMLB) (Use runway 09R/27L only due to gross
weight restrictions)

10.2.3. (Added) C-130E Usage. C-130E including C-130E Group 3 aircraft (WC-130H) may be
used for all flight profiles except SCAs, HAR due to no AR pods and NVG operations. Even
though not specifically addressed in the Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Tasking message there
are no restrictions to flying CARP/HARP Airdrop, Jumpmaster Directed Airdrop, ramp bundles,
CDS, Search Patterns, MA 1/2, parabundle, freefall, pyrotechnic operations, Short Field
Operations and all Non-RAP events. Refer to AFI 11-2HC-130V1, HC-130-Aircrew Training,
for specific items that can be logged per individual crew position.

10.2.3.1. (Added) C-130E currency. HC-130 crewmembers are required to fly the C-130E
including Group 3 aircraft (WC-130H) once every 180 days. If currency in this aircraft is lost, the
crewmember must then review the Differences Power Point presentation and complete an AF
Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report prior to flight. In addition, if any
crewmember is overdue their Basic Sortie requirement in the HC-130, they will need to fly with
an Instructor of the same crew position to regain currency in the C-130E. This currency will not
update the HC-130 Basic Sortie requirement.

10.2.3.2. (Added) 39 RQS/DOV maintains a pubs kit for this aircraft, which is located on the
aircraft. Flight Engineers are responsible for checking its contents when arriving at the aircraft.
Checklists and associated items will be returned to the pubs kit upon completion of the mission.
Use this kit in association with your HC-130 required in-flight pubs.

10.2.3.3. (Added) The AMSS is not part of the basic/mission crew complement. Omit AMSS
responses from tactical checklists. They are encouraged to fly as an ACM to maintain a rescue
crew posture and assist the crew as much as possible. When a AMSS flys on this aircraft, flight
time may be logged as “Other” and duty position will be XK.

10.2.4. (Added) Standard Aircraft Configuration.

10.2.4.1. (Added) Navigation System Equipment. Configuration should include the following
navigation system equipment:

10.2.4.1.1. (Added) Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna

8                                     AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009

10.2.4.1.5. (Added) Surge Protector

10.2.4.1.6. (Added) Power Inverter

10.2.4.1.7. (Added) Do not remove any equipment listed above, unless delivering the aircraft for
PDM, etc. After completing the engine shutdown checklist, unplug the inverter from the co-
pilot’s twist-lock plug. NOTE: As a minimum, mission-planning backpacks will contain GPS
receiver, laptop, laptop power adapter, and a functional data transfer module (DTM) cartridge
with the local reference library installed.

10.2.4.2. (Added) Loadmaster Equipment. Loadmasters will prepare, load, and download
training aids. All training aids not used will be removed by the loadmaster and returned to
loadmaster storage. Training aids that are airdropped will be returned by the drop zone controller
(DZC) to the same facility.

10.2.4.2.1. (Added) Packing Material will never be dumped at sea, IAW International Maritime
Law. Retain all packing and containers not required for the deployment of pyrotechnics or sea
dye markers for disposal upon mission termination.

10.2.4.2.2. (Added) Use of chemlights during night airdrops. Attach chemlights with 80-lb.
cotton webbing to all airdrops at night. SATB require two chemlights for each bundle.

10.2.4.2.3. (Added) Meals Ready to Eat (MRE). Pre-positioned MREs, located in the rescue
bins, are used for actual search air rescue (SAR) airdrop and not for individual consumption.

10.2.5. (Added) Communications Security (COMSEC) Procedures. The AMSS will obtain and
safeguard all required classified documents and COMSEC material. Required COMSEC material
will be as per training and mission requirements. If the AMSS is not available or not required for
the flight, the copilot is responsible for handling, controlling and safeguarding COMSEC material
required for flight. The copilot will sign a hand receipt for the COMSEC package from the
AMSS. Aircrews must have COMSEC user training to receive COMSEC material.

10.2.6. (Added) Operational Check Flights (OCF)/Functional Check Flights (FCF). OCF is
defined as a training/operational flight that performs a system/component check when requested
by 920th Maintenance Group Quality Assurance office (920 MXG/MXQ). OCF’s will be flown
by experienced aircrews and FCF qualification is not required. FCF is defined as a flight
dedicated to determining whether an aircraft and its components are functioning according to T.O.
1C-130E(H)-6CF specifications prior to its release for operational use. In addition to OCF/FCF
required by maintenance, the 39RQS will perform an FCF on each aircraft that comes out of both
Major and Minor ISO.

10.2.6.1. (Added) Perform FCFs from 5 to 30 distance measuring equipment (DME) between the
Patrick Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) COF-095 degree and 155 degree radials.

10.2.6.2. (Added) Pilots and flight engineers will complete a training folder prior to certification.
Navigators and loadmasters will fly an FCF with an instructor prior to certification. These
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009                                                        9

certified crewmembers will be tracked on the squadron Letter of X’s. AMSS’s are not required
on FCF but should be scheduled for the aircraft preflight where feasible.

10.2.6.3. (Added) FCF qualified pilots may perform duties from either seat.

10.2.7. (Added) Space Operations Procedures. All crewmembers participating in King 1 or 2
operations during shuttle launches and Mode VIII exercises will attend an aircrew and Joint Task
Force-Space Transportation System (JTF-STS) briefing unless arrangements are made with the
aircraft commander. Crews should plan on preflighting, loading and sealing the aircraft the day
prior to launch. Crews will receive at least the minimum crew rest prior to a launch and show
with an entire crew duty day for this mission. Once an aircraft is sealed, the operations supervisor
or alert crewmember approval is needed to break the seal; once broken the aircraft will be
continuously monitored by any squadron aircrew member. Failure to follow these procedures
requires the dash 1 preflight be reaccomplished. NVGs and shot records will be carried on all
King 1 or 2 mission.

10.3. (Added) Premission

10.3.1. (Added) Mission Management. The Aircraft Commander is the primary point of contact
for the mission. Mission preparation and mission execution decisions are ultimately the Aircraft
Commanders. The Operations Supervisor and the Operations Duty Controller are there to advise,
coordinate and support the Aircraft Commander.

10.3.2. (Added) Flight Following. Aircraft commanders will ensure the operations duty
controller (ODC) is informed of the mission profile and aircraft location during the flight. Leave
a copy of the flight authorization, operational risk management (ORM), flight plan and any other
pertinent documentation at the operations desk before proceeding to the aircraft.

10.3.3. (Added) Mission Identifiers. Open the MI, report takeoff time, report landing time, and
close the MI with 920 RQW/CP or AFRC/CP (when 920 RQW/CP is closed). Aircrew should
use the operations supervisor/ODC to facilitate the process. The aircraft commander is
responsible for ensuring the AMSS opens the MI a minimum of one hour prior to scheduled
departure. Any change in the estimated time of departure (ETD) of more than 1 hour will be
reported to AFRC/CP. The aircraft commander is responsible to close the MI with AFRC/CP
within one hour of return to home station.

10.3.4. (Added 920RQW) Go/No-Go. The Go/No-Go program is designed to ensure that
aircrews have the latest safety of flight guidance, prevent them from flying while GROUNDED
and ensure they are flying in supervised status if they are non-current or unqualified. The 39 RQS
program follows guidance in AFI 11-202V1, 2, 3 AFI 11-401, AFI 11-2HC-130V1, 2, 3 and 920
OG/CC guidance. The following are the aircraft commanders’ and individual aircrew members’
responsibilities.

10.3.4.1. (Added) Prior to the crew stepping to the aircraft, the aircraft commander will:
10                                   AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009

10.3.4.1.1. (Added) Check the Flight Authorization for discrepancies and make any necessary
changes.

10.3.4.1.2. (Added) Review Individual Currency Summaries or Mission Accomplishment Report
(MAR) for non-current items.

10.3.4.1.3. (Added) Check PEX Go/No-Go page to ensure all crewmembers are green in DNIF,
FCIF, TRAINING, TESTING and S/E. No crew member can fly while red in one of these items.
EXCEPTION: Boldface and SEPT. If these items are accomplished and the AF Form 1522
submitted to the ODC/Ops Supervisor, then the individual can be cleared to fly.

10.3.4.1.4. (Added) Sign orders to verify Go/No-Go was checked

10.3.4.2. (Added) Prior to stepping to the aircraft, individual aircrew members will:

10.7.4.2.1. (Added) Check the current FCIF Parts B and C in PEX.

10.3.4.2.2. (Added) Review their Individual Currency Summary or MAR. If the crewmember is
scheduled for an event for which they are non-current/ unqualified, notify the aircraft commander
and section supervisor.

10.3.4.2.3. (Added) Not step to fly or preflight while grounded.

10.3.4.2.4. (Added) Not accomplish any events in-flight for which they are either unqualified or
non-current (unless under instructor/evaluator supervision).

10.3.4.2.5. (Added) Provide a copy of the AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying
or Special Operational Duty, to 39 RQS/DOTF when placed on DNIF status. Aircrew members
will immediately notify their supervisor, scheduler, and Aviation Resource Management (ARM)
personnel regarding their DNIF status.

10.3.4.3. (Added) Visiting aircrews will profide proof of medical, physiological, and aircrew
qualification prior to flight. Instruct visiting aircrew members to send a copy of their ARM
Individual Data Summary and Individual Training Summary to 39 RQS/DOTF. 39 RQS/DOTF
clears visiting crews to fly by placing them on the Flight Authorization. Visiting aircrew
personnel will complete an initial review of the FCIF, Part B and annotate it on the crew orders
prior to flight.

10.3.4.4. (Added) The 308 RQS manages their own Go/No-Go process. If they show with a
Flight Authorization, Aircraft Commanders may assume they have complied with their Go/No-Go
procedures and place them on the AFTO Form 781. When Combat Rescue Officer
(CRO)/Pararescue Jumper (PJ) do not have a Flight Authorization then aircraft commanders will
assume the Go/No-Go has not been complied with. Do not fly them as aircrew and do not place
them on the AFTO Form 781. If the user is willing to take responsibility then the user may
perform jump duties in MEGP status.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009                                                          11

10.3.4.4.1. (Added) IAW AFI 11-401, Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying
billets, on active flying aeronautical order (AOs) and qualified in the MDS, who are required in
addition to the normal aircrew complement (3 PJ/CRO) to perform in-flight duties for mass
rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log secondary time when performing simulated
patient duties or Mission Coordinator duties on mass personnel recovery training missions.
Secondary time is authorized only during such time those in-flight duties are performed.
In this case, the PJ Team Leader will ensure one of the following statements is annotated on the
back of the AFTO Form 781; 1) In-flight patient eval/treatment, 2) In-flight rescue equipment
deployment preparation, 3) In-flight rescue scenario crew coordination, 4) In-flight rescue
scenario analysis and preparation, or 5) In-flight rescue recovery scanning. The use of any of
these statements will be accompanied by the signature of the PJ Team Leader/CRO.

10.3.4.4.2. (Added) During periods when the PJ is not performing "in-flight" duties associated
with the rescued members or mission coordinator, or non-current for that MDS, only “Other”
flight time will be logged.

10.3.5. (Added) Changes to the Flight Authorization. All write-in changes to the flight
authorization must be initialed by an individual authorized to sign Flight Authorizations prior to
the aircrew stepping to the aircraft. The squadron commander has delegated his authority to
authorize flights without a navigator or radio operator to the Operations Supervisor. The aircraft
commander has the authority to release individual crewmembers from a flight down to a basic
crew compliment.

10.3.6. (Added) Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH). The 39 RQS will follow BASH
guidance contained in AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and Air Force
Pamphlet (AFPAM) 91-212, BASH Management Techniques.

10.3.6.1. (Added) Aircrews will obtain and monitor Bird Watch Condition (BWC) advisories
prior to departure, low-altitude flight (if available) and arrival. Aircrews will adhere to the
following BWC guidance:

10.3.6.1.1. (Added) BWC SEVERE. Takeoffs and landings are prohibited.

10.3.6.1.2. (Added) BWC MODERATE. Takeoffs and full stop landings are allowed if the
departure and arrival route avoids identified bird activity. Traffic pattern activity to include
planned low approaches is prohibited (other than takeoff and full stop landing)

10.3.6.1.3. (Added) BWC LOW. No restrictions to aircraft operations.

10.3.7. (Added) Hearing Protections. Personnel will have two forms of hearing protection (ear
plugs and headsets/muff-type ear defenders or aircrew helmet) available when entering the flight
line. Ear defenders are available for use at the Operations desk.

10.3.7.1. (Added) At least one form of hearing protection will be used when:

10.3.7.1.1. (Added) Within 25 feet of in-use powered aerospace ground equipment.
12                                   AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009

10.3.7.1.2. (Added) Within 100 feet of running aircraft engines, Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) or
Gas Turbine Compressor (GTC).

10.3.7.2. (Added) Ear plugs and one other form of hearing protection will be used within 50 feet
of running aircraft engines, APU or GTC.

10.4. (Added) Enroute

10.4.1. (Added) Turbulence Encountered on Low Level Missions. When winds exceed 25 knots
across a ridgeline or mountaintop, there is a high potential for significant mountain wave
turbulence. When this occurs, crews should avoid flying on the downwind side of ridges and
peaks. Fly upwind or above significant terrain. Avoid terrain-masking flights, which place the
aircraft in narrow canyons, and valleys where turbulence can be enhanced by the venturi effect.

10.4.1.1. (Added) Do not fly low-level in mountainous terrain when surface winds exceed 40
knots (reported or observed).

10.4.1.2. (Added) Flight in areas of forecast severe turbulence is prohibited.

10.4.2. (Added) AFRC CRO/PJs are approval for use of the SOV-3 parachute system. It is a
square parachute similar to the MT1-X with a forward speed of 20.8 Kts. These K factors have
been validated and approved by Natick Airdrop/Aerial Delivery Directorate.

10.4.2.1. (Added) Aircrews and jumpmasters will calculate SOV-3 parachute release points
utilizing K=25 for HALO and K=45 for HAHO parachute deployments. Use ballistics for MT1-
X parachutes from AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures, Table 9.21 to complete
SOV-3 HARP computations.

10.4.3. (Added) Helicopter Air Refueling (HAR) Procedures. Perform HAR on published AR
tracks or within the confines of a military operating area (MOA) to the maximum extent possible.

10.4.3.1. (Added) Coordinates for Marion MOA AR track are:

10.4.3.1.1. (Added) North IP     N27 49.44     W080 59.00

10.4.3.1.2. (Added) North CP     N27 43.44     W080 59.00

10.4.3.1.3. (Added) South CP     N27 20.50     W080 59.00

10.4.3.1.4. (Added) South IP     N27 14.50     W080 59.00

10.4.4. (Added) Hose Jettison. The primary jettison area is the west side of runway 02/20 at
Patrick AFB. The initial approach may be to either runway 02 or 20. If the hose fails to cut
attempt to avoid flying over populated areas. Avoid jettison of hose over the instrument landing
system (ILS) transmitters (red lights at night) on the west side of the approach end of runway 20.
AFI11-2HC-130V3_920RQWSUP 9 FEBRUARY 2009                                                            13

10.4.5. (Added) Pyrotechnic Training Operations. Pyrotechnic operations are permitted at
Cavallo Drop Zone and other approved ranges. Coordinate with the US Coast Guard, command
post, base operations, and Patrick ATC services. When planning pyrotechnic operations, add the
following to the remarks section of DD Form 175: “Pyro drops (flares/smokes) at Cavallo Drop
Zone (COF 115/40) 20 NM radius, altitude, and time frame”.

10.4.5.1. (Added) To aid the Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) in aircraft identification, the
use of the IFF/SIF Mode 3 code of 5015 will be used when penetrating the Air Defense
Identification Zone (ADIZ) during Cavallo DZ operations. This code is valid within 250 miles of
KCOF. Only one aircraft may squawk this code at any given time. Additional squawks may be
obtained from Huntress as required.

10.4.6. (Added) Tactical Recoveries. All tactical recovery procedures will be flown IAW Air
Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-3.33, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals-
HC/MC-130 and 45th Space Wing Instruction (45 SWI) 13-203, Airfield Operations Procedures.
Altitudes above 2500 mean sea level (MSL) will be coordinated with the tower.

10.5. (Added) Postflight

10.5.1. (Added) Hung Ordinance Procedures. Following training involving the live firing of
chaff/flares:

10.5.1.1. (Added) After final landing, taxi to an arm/de-arm area and check for hung ordnance as
follows: The loadmaster will exit the crew entrance door to scan both chin dispensers first using
the inspection mirror obtained from the Rescue Equipment Bin. Then, re-enter the aircraft, close
the crew entrance door and open the cargo ramp and door to inspect the tail, armpit and pylon
dispensers. This procedure will enable the loadmaster to maintain constant interphone
communications with the cockpit crew.

10.5.1.2. (Added) If partially ejected ordinance is identified, notify the MOC, operations
supervisor, and local base controllers to have container recovery system/electronic counter
measure (CRS/ECM) and explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) meet the aircraft. Remain in
arm/de-arm area until EOD personnel can clear all partially ejected ordinances.

10.5.2. (Added) Life Support Equipment. Aircraft returning after normal duty hours will leave
the NVGs in the locked container onboard the aircraft.

10.5.3. (Added) Operations Debrief. After all missions, leave the flight folder with completed
individual mission accomplishment reports, mission accomplishment summary, AFTO Form 781
and a corrected Flight Authorization in the flight management in-box.

14.3.1.1. (Added) Visual Flight Rules Operations. Advisory calls shall be made to all airports
whether controlled or uncontrolled on the VFR route using appropriate airfield frequencies while
transiting its airspace. Advisory calls will include call sign, type of aircraft, position, altitude and
direction.
