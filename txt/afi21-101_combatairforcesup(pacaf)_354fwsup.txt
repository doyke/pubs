jettison due to a system malfunction when properly commanded by the pilot. NOTE: For
munitions sustaining damage during flight e.g., bird strike, hail storm, etc., apply hung free-fall
ordnance criteria.
14.13.10.5.2.1. (Added 354FW). Recover aircraft in the normal de-arm area. The de-arm crew
will perform a thorough inspection of all munitions to ensure no armed or unsafe condition
exists. If a condition is found that the de-arm crew is uncertain about, they will request assistance
from a 7 skill level weapons supervisor. If all munitions can be safed and pinned, allow the
aircraft to taxi back to parking spot. If munitions are unsafe, notify the MOC immediately and
evacuate the area. Do not reenter area until all munitions have been safed by EOD.
14.13.10.5.2.2. (Added 354FW). When the inspection of an aircraft reveals a munitions hanging
by one lug, the aircraft will be chocked and shut down. After safing all other munitions, the MJ-1

nearest the runway (heading 130 degrees), if available. The MOC will notify the weapons
expediter and armament maintenance section personnel of all in-flight emergencies involving
guns. The weapons expediter will dispatch personnel to install safety pins, and attempt to
safe/clear the gun. WARNING: Personnel will not attempt to clear rounds from the gun when
system stoppage (jam) occurred in flight unless otherwise authorized per MDS technical data. If
the crew cannot mechanically and/or electrically safe the gun or suspect there are live rounds in
the firing path, direct the aircraft to the gun berm. NOTE: Use the gun berm if possible, even if
it requires removing an aircraft (non-jammed gun) from the berm. In a situation where two
aircraft have jammed guns or an aircraft is on the berm and cannot be moved, the MXG/CC or
designated representative may direct that taxiway Echo de-arm area be used to clear/safe a
jammed gun. De-arm crews will perform a FOD inspection of the gun berm and Echo de-arm
area prior to the landing of the first scheduled sortie. The de-arm crew will also ensure proper
firefighting equipment is present at each location. Weapons and flightline expediters will be
prepared with necessary tools/equipment/personnel to respond to any hung/jammed gun
scenario. If the gun can be verified safe/clear, return aircraft to parking area. If unsuccessful,
direct the pilot to taxi the aircraft to the gun berm and shut down to be electrically and
mechanically safed to the maximum extent possible. If gun clear cannot be verified, download all
live munitions first, if applicable, and then continue with gun clearing maintenance in
accordance with applicable procedures.
14.13.10.5.3.3.3. (Added 354FW). Gun system sudden stoppages that occur during firing require
the entire gun system removed for an in-shop inspection.
14.13.10.5.3.3.4. (Added 354FW). During normal de-arm operations, if the gun cannot be
pinned or suspected live rounds are in a gun that cannot be cleared, the pilot will be directed to
declare a ground emergency and taxi the aircraft to the gun berm. The de-arm crew will notify
the MOC as soon as possible of the unsafe/jammed gun. Download all live munitions first, if
applicable, and then continue with gun clearing maintenance.
14.13.10.5.4. (Added 354FW). Hot brakes. If brake channels are glowing hot or smoke exists,
do not approach brakes. Deflation of the main landing gear tire indicates melting of thermal
plugs and hot brake condition. Notify the pilot and evacuate area immediately to a minimum safe
distance of 300 feet and notify the MOC of the situation. MOC will run the Hot Brakes
Emergency Action Checklist. Prepare to move the de-arm operation to an alternate area as
designated by the SOF. MOC will relay to the de-arm crew and applicable production
superintendent of alternate de-arm area.

FOD conditions occur, MOC will broadcast an Ice FOD advisory per the Weather Advisory
Emergency Action Checklist. Production superintendents will ensure EOR personnel are
notified.
14.13.10.6.1.1. (Added 354FW). Upon notification of an ICE FOD alert, the EOR supervisor
will visually inspect the aircraft for the presence of ice, paying particular attention to the engine

and towed back to parking area.
14.13.10.6.2. (Added 354FW). If an aircraft had an in-flight engine malfunction due to

b. Review the AFTO form 781A's to ensure ALL open write-ups are documented on the IMDS
rip to include 781 A's page # and block #.
c. Review the front of the 7AFTO form 781K to ensure the next Phase due is correct, reflects the
currently installed engine serial number, and verify the aircraft LOX converter and battery serial
numbers.
Review the Deferred Discrepancies and ensure that they are all documented on the back of the
AFTO form 781K.
d. Inventory TNB & FOM
e. Inventory tank hardware box & check for serviceability
f. Ensure missing items shown on the Configuration Tracked Item Inquiry are corrected by the
owning work center in IMDS prior to records check completion. Print a new 781K after records
check completion.
 g. Ensure waiver letters/107 requests and expiration dates.

3. Inventory and account for -21 equipment.
