SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been revised and should be completely reviewed. The following four
changes have been made; wear of the floppy hat is not authorized for wear by military personnel
on the flightline; Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Sub-pool yards located on Taxiway
Bravo do not require tire F.O. check when exiting, AGE Personnel will be responsible for FOD
Checks in this area; tire roll-over FOD checks are required and will be done at the entry control
point or immediately within the entry control point/flightline area, far enough to avoid traffic
congestion; removal of the identification plate and 2 rivets from the anti-personnel guards and
bellmouth screens; and removal of Engine FOD Impoundment Logic Tree.

   maintenance. Additionally, personnel performing maintenance or inspections in a confined
   area of the aircraft (including the intake/exhaust or cockpit) will not wear F.O. bags in these
   areas.
   4.3. Squadrons/units/flights may use their colors for F.O. bags, but are responsible for
   procuring the material. Velcro tape running across the entire opening will be used to keep
   the flaps closed.
   4.4. Vehicle, shop or hangar FOD collection containers will be black with white letters or
   white with black letters. The letters (FOD) will be two-inch minimum in height. Vehicle
   containers will be lidded, with the lid secured to the container (self closing type, ammo cans,

   5.2. A tire F.O. roll-over check (to include towed equipment) will be accomplished, at the
   entry control point or immediately within the entry control point/flightline area, far enough to
   avoid traffic congestion, every time the vehicle enters the flight line area IAW AFI 13-213
   and AFI 21-101. Exception: Emergency vehicles responding to actual emergencies. Once
   the actual emergency is over, a tire F.O. roll-over check will be accomplished prior to
   continuing on. Aircraft tow vehicles that will tow aircraft through an entry control point will
   perform a tire F.O. roll-over check at the start of the tow and upon tow completion.
      5.2.1. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Sub-pool yards located on Taxiway Bravo(
      adjacent to the 62 AMU, Bldg 431) and Short Echo are designated as a continuous part of
      the flight line, concrete to concrete and a tire F.O. check is not required when exiting
      these designated areas back on to the flight line.
   5.3. Use of magnetic bars on the flight line is mandatory for TAMS, specialist, and weapons
   expediter vehicles in each Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU), Airfield sweepers, and
   AGE/Line Delivery vehicles from 56th Equipment Maintenance Squadron (EMS). Vehicles
   equipped with magnets will adjust magnet clearance three to five inches from ramp.
   Magnets will be inspected and cleaned as part of the vehicle inspection and checked for
   debris during F.O. checks at the actual point of entry, every time the vehicle enters the
   aircraft movement area. NOTE: Vehicles on loan from Transportation require magnets
   installed as long as vehicle is configured or equipped with the necessary hardware.

6. Airfield Policing.
     6.1. Commanders, including TDY units, will ensure the areas designated below are policed
     daily by all maintenance personnel performing FOD walks.
        6.1.1. FOD walks will be accomplished prior to first launch or first recovery when
        sufficient lighting is available, and as needed during the day. Special attention will be
        given to cleaning of cracks and expansion seams in hard surfaced areas where engines
        will be operated. Units will vacuum out the grounding points on the parking ramp once
