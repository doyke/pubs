This operating instruction implements AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medical Program, and establishes
responsibilities and procedures for operating fixed and mobile radiation emitters. It applies to all
personnel assigned permanently or temporarily to the 934th Airlift Wing (AW). Commanders,
supervisors and superintendents are responsible for ensuring compliance with this instruction.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, route
the AF Form 847s directly to 934 MXS/MXMVC at Minneapolis St. Paul ARS, MN. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. The
use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or
service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

1. Responsibilities: All base supervisors responsible for those personnel with access to the
flight line area and building 805 will ensure those personnel are informed of this Airlift Wing
instruction. Operators of the systems addressed in this AWI are responsible for ensuring safety
procedures outlined in paragraph 3 are followed. Maintenance personnel will review the
Radiation Frequency (RF) video and power point showing hazard areas annually. Training will
be annotated in G081 under the applicable course code. Personnel of other areas with access to
the flight line area will be familiar with this AWI for safety awareness purposes. Documentation
for these individuals will utilize their unit’s procedures.
2. Location of Fixed and Mobile Emitters of Radiation Frequency Radiation:

     2.1. South side of building 805, Communications/Navigations section has a fixed UHF, HF
     and VHF antenna mounted on the roof.
        2.1.1. Aircraft parking spots 1 – 9A, when aircraft radios and radar are operating.
3. Procedures:
     3.1. Radiation warning signs are not required during the operation of any communication,
     navigation or radar systems. Warning signs are used on the flightline when the AAQ-24
     (LAIRCM) system is operated by maintenance technicians.
     3.2. Aircraft parking spots 1 through 9A are approved for operating aircraft radios and radar
     with no additional restrictions. Aircraft parking spot 1 is normally used when the LAIRCM
     system is operated. When LAIRCM is operated in a parking spot other than spot 1 normal
     safety precautions still apply. It is the responsibility of the radio and radar and laser operator
     to inform other personnel in the vicinity when transmitting so proper safety precautions can
     be made. The following are precautions for the stated systems:
        3.2.1. ARC 164/186 UHF/VHF Radios: Keep personnel clear of antenna when
        transmitting. Do not transmit during fueling or servicing LOX.
        3.2.2. AN/ARN 118 TACAN System: Keep personnel 30 inches away from antenna
        when transmitting. Do not transmit during fueling or servicing LOX.
        3.2.3. AN/ARC 190 HF Radio System: Ensure no one is performing maintenance on top
        of the aircraft when transmitting. Do not transmit during fueling or servicing LOX.
        3.2.4. AN/ALR 69 Radar Warning System: Do not stand within 6 feet of PLM-4 and
        APM-427 test simulators during receiver testing. Do not transmit during fueling or
        servicing LOX.
        3.2.5. AN-APN-241 Low Power Color Radar: Avoid prolonged exposure in front of the
        nose radome when transmitting. Do not transmit during fueling or servicing LOX.
        3.2.6. AAQ-24 LAIRCM: Avoid entering the area of the warning cones while aircraft
        LAIRCM system is operating. Do not transmit during fueling or servicing LOX.
4. Overexposure:
     4.1. Any suspected or alleged overexposure will be promptly reported to the following:
        4.1.1. Maintenance Operations Control Center at 713-1328/1330/1352; Radio Call Sign:
        MOCC.
        4.1.2. Bio-Environmental Engineering at713-1608/1611.
        4.1.3. Immediate Supervisor
