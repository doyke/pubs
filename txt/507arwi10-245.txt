1. RESPONSIBILITIES. All personnel are responsible for the buildings and work areas in
which they perform their work related functions. The Unit Antiterrorism Officer (UATO) and
Representatives (UATR), in conjunction with the Unit Control Center (UCC) when it is enacted,
ensure FPCON notification is completed in all buildings/facilities assigned. In addition, the Unit
Anti-terrorism Officer or Representative (UATO/R) ensures Unit procedures as well as
procedures outlined in the Tinker AFB’s Installation Security Plan (TAFB Plan 31-101) and
Antiterrorism Plan (TAFB Plan 10-245) are implemented.
2. COMMANDERS INTENT. I intend to execute an aggressive AT program to protect our
personnel, their families, facilities and materiel resources against terrorist attack. Threat
information will drive appropriate AT measures and the course of action. We will deter attacks
by establishing a layered defense of our Wing facilities and programs, implementing baseline AT
physical security measures and execute additional security measures as FPCON levels escalate
and establishing security enclaves for identified critical assets. Implementation of access control
procedures into each of our critical assets will be essential to this layered defense approach.
Emphasis will be on following the recommendations of the installation antiterrorism officer
supporting AT, training and exercising installation plans. If an attack occurs, or efforts during
the incident phase will focus on executing incident response procedures designed to mitigate and
contain the attack. The post-incident phase will concentrate on implementing consequence
management procedures to restore normal operations as quickly and efficiently as possible.
3. ANCILLARY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. All military and DoD civilian personnel,
are required to complete Level I AT/FP training annually. Contractors working on the
installation are to be afforded the opportunity to complete the training. IAW AFI 10-245, The
Air Force Anti-terrorism/Force Protection Program Standards, and training will be documented
in personal training records, the Advanced Distanced Learning System transcripts, or thru
ARCNet. The Unit Training Manager (UTM) will ensure this requirement is met and ensure the
training is documented. The Unit Deployment Manager (UDM) will contact the UATO/R or to
ensure personnel going TDY have received the training prior to departure. The UATO/R will
maintain a record of trained individuals and be able to provide the percentage of trained
personnel in the unit upon the Wing Anti-terrorism Officer (ATO) request.
     3.1. All Air Force Reserve personnel will need a current threat brief concerning the area of
     responsibility they are going to within three months of any deployment., leave or travel
     outside the continental United States, based on the destination. Det 114 AFOSI/SAIC Memo
     dated 6 Jan 09 states that individuals going to China, France, Georgia, India, Japan, Libya,
     Pakistan, Russia, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Sought Korea, Taiwan, Turkey and Venezuela require
     a brief from OSI. This list is subject to change and unit security managers will have the
     latest information.
     3.2. Worldwide threat levels can be found on the Defense Intelligence Agency’s (DIA)
     Combating Terrorism Knowledge Base (CTKB) website (http://ctkb.dia.smil.mil) which
     can be accessed with a SIPR net account. Contractors and dependents should be encouraged
     to receive the AT Level I training before leaving the CONUS for any reason.

4. UNIT-SPECIFIC FPCON MEASURES. The 72 ABW will tailor FPCON measures to
organizational specific tasks as needed. The complete list of FPCON measures with the tasks
required to complete the measures will be kept in a clearly marked notebook by the UATO/R.
During heightened FPCONs the UATO/R will send tasking to the various offices for
implementation as needed.
   4.1. The UATO/R and supervisors will assign individuals to perform the various measures.
   If possible, the tasks will be rotated among all personnel to insure all are familiar with
   actions to perform under increased threats and higher FPCONs.
5. BOMB THREAT PROCEDURES
   5.1. PROCEDURES. In accordance with written guidance in Annex C to Appendix 1 to Tab
   N, to TAFB Plan 31-101.
   5.2. REMAIN CALM. When notification of a bomb threat is received by phone or courier it
   is very important to remain as calm as possible. Any over reaction on your part may cause
   the caller to prematurely detonate the device or cause the device to detonate. Remaining
   calm also allows you to focus on the gathering of information to pass on to Security Forces.
   5.3. INFORMATION GATHERING. Any information you can obtain will aid in the
   location and disposal of the suspected device. Written bomb threats will be handled by
   Security Forces and AFOSI Det 114. Preserve the written threats with a plastic bag as
   evidence. If phoned in try to prolong the conversation to obtain the following information:
      5.3.1. Specific location of the device and time in which it is to explode.
      5.3.2. Description of the device. What shape is it, how much explosives were used,
      anything that could aid in locating and defusing the bomb.
      5.3.3. Why the bomb was placed.
      5.3.4. Refer to and complete AF Form 440.
   5.4. NOTIFICATION. While the caller is on the phone:

      receiver only when instructed to do so by the Base Telephone Exchange or the Force
      Protection Operations Center (FPOC).
      5.4.2. Immediately notify a co-worker to contact the BDOC at 734-3737 or 911 and
      inform them of the telephone number the threat was phoned in on, the building number,
      aircraft number or area involved.
      5.4.3. Notify your supervisor or area supervisor and pass on all the information.
