       USAF/A2.
       1.2.3.2. Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message.
1.3. Qualification Training. Qualification training programs are designed to progress intelligence
personnel from Initial Qualification Training (IQT) to Mission Qualification Training (MQT) to achieve
CMR or BMC status which will be maintained via continuation training and validated by periodic
evaluations. Qualification training is separate from skill level upgrade training, although qualification
training may fulfill some skill level upgrade training requirements.
    1.3.1. IQT provides the initial training necessary to qualify intelligence personnel for basic duties in
    an intelligence position without regard to a unitâ€™s mission. Upon completion of IQT, intelligence
    personnel attain Basic Qualification (BQ) status. BQ is a prerequisite for MQT. BQ is not a long-
    term qualification status. IQT is discussed further in Chapter 2 of this instruction.
    1.3.2. MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or requalify intelligence personnel in a
    specific duty position to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Intelligence personnel
    maintain BQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for CMR or
    BMC status. MQT for all AFSOF and PR intelligence personnel is discussed further in Chapter 3 of
    this instruction. Additional MQT training required for special tactics intelligence personnel is
    discussed in Chapter 6, and for PR personnel in Chapter 7. Table 1.1. summarizes the knowledge
    and task training for AFSOF and PR personnel.
    1.3.3. Continuation Training (CT) provides the volume, frequency and mix of training necessary for
    intelligence personnel to maintain proficiency in their assigned qualification level. The Ready
    Intelligence Program (RIP) outlines the minimum CT requirements. RIP is designed to focus
    training on capabilities needed to accomplish a unitâ€™s core tasked missions. CT is separate from skill
AFI14-2AFSOF-PRV1 1 JUNE 2009                                                                            5


   level upgrade training, although CT may fulfill some skill level upgrade training requirements. CT
   and RIP for all AFSOF and PR intelligence personnel are discussed further in Chapter 4 of this
   instruction. Additional CT/RIP requirements for special tactics intelligence personnel are discussed
   in Chapter 6, and for PR personnel in Chapter 7. Table 4.1. summarizes continuation training for
   AFSOF and PR personnel.
   1.3.4. Specialized training is training on any skill necessary to carry out the unitâ€™s assigned missions
   that is not required for every intelligence unit member. Specialized training is accomplished after
   Mission Qualification Training and after the member has attained CMR or BMC status, and is in
   addition to CMR or BMC requirements. Specialized training for all AFSOF and PR intelligence
   personnel is discussed further in Chapter 5 of this instruction. Additional specialized training for
   special tactics intelligence personnel is discussed in Chapter 6, and for PR personnel in Chapter 7.
   Table 1.1. summarizes the specialized training for AFSOF and PR personnel.

1.4. Position Qualification. Wing SIOs will designate which positions are CMR or BMC. At a
minimum, all active duty and Air National Guard flying squadron and active duty and Air National
Guard ST squadron intelligence personnel will be CMR. AFRC flying squadron and ST squadron
intelligence personnel may be BMC with the ability to attain CMR currency within 30 days.
    1.4.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). CMR is the status of intelligence personnel who have
    satisfactorily completed MQT and maintain qualification and currency in the mission qualification
    tasks and knowledge outlined in this instruction.
       1.4.1.1. CMR intelligence personnel maintain currency by accomplishing all designated tasks
       within the prescribed timelines. See Chapter 4, Table 4.1., for RIP currency requirements and
       Chapter 5, Table 5.1., for Specialized Training currency requirements. Failure to complete this
       training or maintain these currencies will result in regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status
       unless waived by the SIO. While N-CMR, personnel may perform only individual tasks in
       which they are current and qualified.
       1.4.1.2. Personnel should meet CMR currency requirements before deploying. However, in the
       case of short-notice deployments where this is not possible, the SIO can allow BMC personnel to
       deploy. If the SIO is forced to deploy an individual who hasn't met CMR currency requirements,
       the SIO will ensure the member's deployed chain-of-command is aware of the member's
       currency status.
    1.4.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). BMC is the status of intelligence personnel who have
    satisfactorily completed MQT, are qualified in the core mission skills of their unit, but do not
    maintain CMR status. BMC personnel must be able to attain CMR currency within 30 days.
       1.4.2.1. BMC designations are assigned to intelligence personnel who primarily perform
       wing/group supervision or staff functions that directly support intelligence operations. Personnel
       must be able to attain CMR currency within 30 days.
       1.4.2.2. BMC personnel must maintain currencies by accomplishing all designated tasks within
       the prescribed timelines. See Chapter 4, Table 4.1. of this instruction for RIP currency
       requirements and Chapter 5, Table 5.1., for specialized training currency requirements. Failure
       to complete BMC required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-
       BMC, the individual may perform only individual tasks in which they are current and qualified.
    1.4.3. Intelligence personnel who regress to N-CMR or N-BMC status will accomplish the
    requirements IAW Chapter 4 before being re-awarded CMR or BMC status.
    1.4.4. Qualification training and evaluation requirements are summarized in Table 1.2. SOF and PR
    Intelligence Training Requirements.
AFI14-2AFSOF-PRV1 1 JUNE 2009                                                                         7

                               INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines initial qualification training (IQT) of AFSOF and PR unit
intelligence personnel. IQT for intelligence personnel begins after initial skills training is completed
(i.e. the AFSC-awarding courses) and will consist of the AFSOC Intelligence Formal Training Unit
(IFTU). At the completion of IQT, the individual is certified as BQ. In exceptional circumstances,
when IFTU training is not available within a reasonable time period, the IFTU portion of IQT may be
conducted at the local unit IAW this chapter. When authorized, local IQT will be conducted by unit
intelligence training personnel using materials provided by the lead MAJCOM. The following guidance
applies only to other than formal course AFSOC IFTU IQT:
2.2. Waiver Approval for IQT.
   2.2.1. MAJCOM/A2 is the approval authority to conduct local IQT, and is the waiver authority to
   change the formal requirements of locally conducted IQT.
   2.2.2. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:
       2.2.2.1. Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training.
       2.2.2.2. Summary of individualâ€™s intelligence career field experience.
       2.2.2.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.2.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.
2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus.
2.4. Intelligence Training.
   2.4.1. Training will be completed within the time specified by the IFTU syllabus. Failure to
   complete training within the specified time limit requires notification to MAJCOM/A2 (ANG:
   NGB/A2; AFRC: NAF/A2 and AFRC/A2) with personâ€™s name, rank, reason for delay, planned
   actions and estimated completion date.
   2.4.2. Personnel in IQT will perform intelligence functions under supervision until completing the
   qualification evaluation (QUAL).
   2.4.3. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for IQT;
   however, additional training events may be added at the discretion of the SIO for reasons based on
   student proficiency, experience or non-progression.
   2.4.4. Personnel completing local IQT will be evaluated according to the same criteria as individuals

                             MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. Mission qualification training (MQT) is training necessary to qualify intelligence
personnel in an assigned duty position to perform the unit mission. Guidance in this chapter is provided
to assist SIOs in executing the MAJCOM/A2 approved minimum MQT requirements for all AFSOF and
PR intelligence personnel newly assigned the BQ. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional MQT
required for special tactics intelligence personnel, and Chapter 7 for additional MQT required for PR
personnel. Units may further tailor their programs for intelligence personnel with current qualifications,
prior experience, currency, documented performance or formal training. Applicable portions of MQT
may be used to create a re-qualification program for personnel who have regressed from CMR or BMC
to specifically address deficiencies which caused regression.
    3.1.1. Intelligence personnel must have completed IQT before MQT can be completed.
    3.1.2. MQT timing starts within 45 days (90 days for AFRC and ANG) of the individualâ€™s first duty
    day at the gaining unit. If personnel elect to take leave prior to being entered into MQT, the timing
    will begin after the termination of the leave. For first term airmen being entered into MQT, the
    timing will begin upon completion of the First Term Airman Course (or equivalent) at their gaining
    unit. Training is complete upon successful accomplishment of MQT tasks, a successful INIT MSN
    IAW AFI 14-2AFSOF/PR, Volume 2, and AFI 14-202, Volume 2, and SIO endorsement to CMR or
    BMC, as appropriate.
       3.1.2.1. For AFRC, notify AFRC/A2 and NAF/A2 if training exceeds 120 days with seasoning
       or 180 calendar days without seasoning. For individual mobilization augmentees (IMAs), notify
       MAJCOM intelligence IMA Program Manager and AFRC/A2.
       3.1.2.2. For ANG, notify NGB/A2 if training exceeds 180 calendar days.
       3.1.2.3. For AFSOC, ACC, PACAF, and USAFE, notify MAJCOM/A2 if training exceeds 120
       calendar days.
    3.1.3. Personnel in MQT may participate in exercises if supervised while performing intelligence
    functions. The level of supervision is at the SIOâ€™s discretion.
    3.1.4. Assigned IMAs will be trained and equipped to established command standards for the
    positions they will assume. IMAs will have the same training timelines as AFRC and ANG
    members (ARC).
    3.1.5. Personnel may complete other local area orientation and training while completing MQT.
3.2. Mission Qualification Training Evaluation. Personnel are qualified as CMR or BMC upon
successful evaluation of required tasks, to include completed gradesheets (AF Form 4381), a successful
INIT MSN in accordance with AFI 14-202, Volume 2, AFI 14-2AFSOF/PR, Volume 2, and
endorsement from the SIO. Reference AFI 14-2AFSOF/PR, Volume 2, for a more detailed explanation
of evaluations.
3.3. Knowledge and Task Training.
    3.3.1. Knowledge MQT. Units will develop blocks of instruction, derived from lead MAJCOM-
    developed training materials, covering areas pertinent to the mission as determined by the SIO.
    Blocks of instruction will include all unique local area procedures relevant to the tasks and will
    ensure the trainee is able to demonstrate knowledge area proficiency via separate tests on each area

                                     CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter outlines intelligence CT requirements for CMR and BMC intelligence
personnel. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of internal intelligence training in basic
intelligence task and knowledge items. These training topics ensure familiarization with local unit
intelligence functions, AFSOF/PR capabilities and threat system capabilities. The second aspect of CT
consists of specific mission-related training required to accomplish the unitâ€™s assigned missions. The
Ready Intelligence Program (RIP) is designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish the
unitâ€™s tasked missions. CMR and BMC intelligence personnel must complete appropriate RIP tasks and
successfully accomplish periodic mission qualification evaluations (MSNs) in accordance with AFI 14-
202, Volume 2, and AFI 14-2AFSOF/PR, Volume 2, to maintain currency and qualification. See
Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional CT considerations for special tactics intelligence personnel,
and Chapter 7 for additional CT considerations for PR personnel.
4.2. Internal Intelligence Training Program. The internal intelligence training program is intended to
facilitate maintaining designated qualification and currency status of all intelligence personnel. While
the SIO is ultimately accountable for the successful completion of all required training, individual
training is the responsibility of the trainee and supervisor. This guidance is intended to provide a basic
starting point and may be modified by the SIO based on unit requirements. Training for these events
will consist of unit-developed academics and scenarios.
     4.2.1. The Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager will oversee program execution.
     Where assigned, the USAF Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course graduate will provide input into
     the internal intelligence training program.
     4.2.2. Internal Intelligence Training Plan. The Internal Intelligence Training Program Manager will
     develop an annual internal intelligence training plan, which includes all training items for each
     intelligence duty position in the unit and is in compliance with local internal training plan guidance.
        4.2.2.1. The internal intelligence training program manager, in coordination with the SIO, will
        establish the training frequency for each internal training item except where dictated by this or
        any other instruction.
        4.2.2.2. Written examinations will be compiled from the lead MAJCOM-maintained MQF as a
        minimum. The Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager will augment the MQF with
        specific questions relevant to the unit mission.
     4.2.3. Internal Intelligence Training Program Requirements. The internal intelligence training
     program should continue to emphasize IQT tasks as identified in Chapter 2 and MQT tasks as
     identified in Chapters 3, 6, and 7 (as applicable) of this instruction. In addition, the Internal
     Intelligence Training Program will cover theater indoctrination training and current intelligence
     briefings.
4.3. Ready Intelligence Program (RIP). The intent of RIP is to ensure intelligence personnel perform
specific mission essential tasks with sufficient frequency to maintain proficiency in their duty positions.
In order to maximize training opportunities and minimize artificiality, RIP tasks should be conducted in
a realistic training environment in conjunction with unit operator training (e.g. Special Operations
Planning Exercises, Full Mission Profiles, Deployment Exercises, local live fly exercises, etc.) as much
as possible. Individuals are responsible for documenting RIP task completion. The standard task
AFI14-2AFSOF-PRV1 1 JUNE 2009                                                                              15


requirements listed in Table 4.1. AFSOF/PR Ready Intelligence Program Requirements, establish the
minimum frequency requirement for CMR and BMC personnel. All intelligence personnel filling duty
positions that are designated as CMR or BMC will accomplish the requirements as shown in Table 4.2.
Failure to accomplish these requirements will affect the individualâ€™s CMR or BMC currency and
additional training will be required as determined by the SIO.
4.4. Currency. Table 4.1. defines frequency requirements for all intelligence personnel to maintain
current CMR or BMC status. If an intelligence specialist loses currency in a particular area, the
individual may not perform that task unsupervised until currency is regained. Intelligence personnel
must demonstrate proficiency in all delinquent RIP items with an SIO-designated supervisor to regain
currency. For example, if an individual accomplished a semi-annual RIP item (e.g., Debriefing) on 15
Oct 07, he/she must accomplish that task again by 15 Apr 08 to remain current. If the task is not
completed in the specified timeframe, the individual becomes non-current and must demonstrate
proficiency of the task with an SIO-designated supervisor prior to conducting the task unsupervised.

5.1. Specialized Training Programs. This chapter outlines specialized training programs for
specialized qualifications that apply to all AFSOF and PR intelligence units. These qualifications are in
addition to core missions for the unit and do not apply to all intelligence personnel assigned or attached
to the unit. These programs are intended to provide the SIOs the minimum approved specialized
training programs for individuals with no previous qualifications and may be tailored for intelligence
personnel with current qualifications, prior experience, currency, documented performance or formal
training. Unless governed by a formal syllabus, these programs will consist of unit-developed
academics and scenarios. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional specialized training required
for special tactics intelligence personnel, and Chapter 7 for additional specialized training required for
PR personnel.
5.2. External Intelligence Trainer (EIT) Specialized Training. This program establishes the
minimum guidelines for intelligence personnel identified by the SIO to progress to EITs within the unit.
Only qualified EITs may conduct unsupervised external intelligence training for operators. All
intelligence personnel assigned or attached to a special operations squadron must be qualified as EITs.
Intelligence personnel who are graduates of USAF Weapons School and have been awarded the â€•Wâ€–
prefix are certified to be EITs. Currency requirements apply to maintain this specialized qualification;
see Table 5.1.
   5.2.1. Requirements. Intelligence personnel selected for EIT specialized training must:
       5.2.1.1. Complete MQT.
       5.2.1.2. Be current and qualified in their training status (CMR or BMC).
       5.2.1.3. Before teaching PR, EITs must complete Code of Conduct Training (CoCT) Level B
       training (academics needed by personnel who have a moderate risk of capture during peacetime
       or combat). Reference AFI 36-2209, Survival and Code of Conduct Training.
       5.2.1.4. Complete all or some of the following unit-developed EIT profiles depending on
       whether the SIO wishes an individual to attain a full or partial EIT specialized qualification. EIT
       1 is mandatory for all. Operational unit assigned/attached personnel do not have the partial
       qualification option. Units may add considerations/techniques for specialized training to
       applicable areas.

   Protection, and AFI 10-245, Air Force Anti-Terrorism Standards, and MAJCOM supplements are
   used.
   5.2.4. External Intelligence Trainer Evaluation. EIT evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 14-
   202, Volume 2, and AFI 14-2AFSOF/PR, Volume 2. Personnel are qualified as EITs upon
   successful evaluation of required tasks, an initial external intelligence training instructor evaluation
   (INIT EIT) and endorsement from the SIO. Only Intelligence Evaluators (IEs) may conduct INIT
   EIT and EIT evaluations. Personnel not assigned or attached to an operational squadron may be
   qualified to instruct in individual training (threat, C&R, VR, and/or PR), as determined by the SIO.
   All external intelligence trainers must be qualified prior to conducting unsupervised training. In
   certain circumstances it may be beneficial to qualify an individual to conduct training in one or more
   events, but not require a full EIT qualification. The individual must complete the specific training
   identified for the event and be evaluated on the task/briefing element by an IE. Document the
   evaluation IAW local procedures. The individual must maintain currency for the subject matter
   according to Table 5.1. and must be reevaluated IAW the AFI 14-202, Volume 2, and AFI 14-
   2AFSOF/PR, Volume 2.
   5.2.5. External Intelligence Trainer Currency. Table 5.1. External Intelligence Trainer Event
   Currencies, defines currency requirements for all intelligence personnel required to maintain current
   EIT status. EITs must also successfully complete periodic External Intelligence Trainer evaluations
   (EITs) in accordance with AFI 14-2AFSOF/PR, Volume 2. If an external intelligence trainer loses
   currency in a particular area, the individual may not perform training unsupervised until currency is
   regained. To regain currency EITs must satisfy overdue training requirements while supervised by
   another EIT current and qualified in the same training requirement.
