           develop and implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) within
           Federal and state regulatory time limits (40 CFR 122.26 and 123.25). For overseas
           locations, the FGS or OEBGD also require the development and implementation of a
           SWPPP. Develop and implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) to eliminate
           and reduce pollutants. Pursue non-structural BMPs before considering structural
           BMPs. Ensure BMPs are achievable and cost effective. The BMPs and other
           requirements written into the SWPPP are enforceable.
           2.2.2.1.2. Each regulated installation shall establish a cross-functional Storm Water
           Pollution Prevention Program team to develop and implement storm water
           management programs that effectively reduce or prevent the discharge of pollutants
           into receiving waters and manage the installation’s Storm Water Pollution Prevention
           Program. The SWPPP team should include, at a minimum, CE, Bioenvironmental
           Engineering (BE), JA, and Public Affairs (PA). Based on installation-specific needs,
           additional organizations that have an impact on storm water should also be included
           in the SWPPP team.*

        with the hard copy of the SWPPP located in the Stormwater Program Managers
        Office.
        2.2.2.1.5. (Added-EGLINAFB) Visual monitoring of designated stormwater
        outfalls shall be completed quarterly each year of the 5 year MSGP as described in
        the SWPPP. Analytical monitoring of selected representative stormwater outfalls
        shall be completed quarterly during years 2 and 4 of the permit. If an outfall has no
        exceedances beyond permitted limits during year 2 sampling, sampling in year 4 is
        not required.
        2.2.2.1.6. (Added-EGLINAFB) Qualified facility personnel shall inspect industrial
        areas of the facility on the prescribed frequency as designated in the SWPPP. All
        inspections shall be documented.
     2.2.2.2. Regulated Construction Activities. Construction activities disturbing one (1) or
     more acres in aggregate require a completed SWPPP and the timely submission of a
     Notice of Intent (NOI). The project manager should review the construction activities to
     determine whether exemptions to submitting an NOI are available. Attention should be
     given to permitting authority-specific requirements such as: parties required to submit a
     NOI, signatory authority, keeping a copy of the plan on-site, and statutory waiting period
     after submission of the NOI before construction can begin. For overseas locations,
     coordinate with your construction agent to comply with any FGS requirements.
     2.2.2.2. (EGLINAFB) During construction, the permittee, whether in-house or contract,
     shall comply with all terms and conditions of all stormwater permits, including weekly
     inspections by qualified personnel. Inspections and follow-up actions shall be
     documented. Under most circumstances when the construction is being performed by
     contract, the contractor shall be the permittee.
        2.2.2.2.1. Upon final stabilization of construction site, permittee shall submit a
        Notice of Termination (NOT) to the permitting agency.*
     2.2.2.3. Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4). Installations are
     automatically regulated as Small MS4s if they are located within an Urbanized Area
     (UA), designated by the Bureau of the Census. Installations should consult with JA to
     determine whether the installation is required to comply with MS4 requirements. Under
     some conditions, the regulatory agency may designate installations not located in a UA
     for MS4 permit coverage.*
AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 32-7041_EGLINAFBSUP_I 16 JUNE 2010                                     11


         2.2.2.3.1. Regulated small MS4s must submit an NOI and a 5-year storm water
         management plan (SWMP) to obtain coverage under a small MS4 NPDES storm
         water permit. The SWMPs must address minimum control measures, along with
         measurable goals, as stated in the current EPA Phase II Rule (64 Federal Register
         (FR) 68722, December 8, 1999) or applicable state or local MS4 permit requirements.

         applicable state or local MS4 permit requirements.
         2.2.2.3.3. (Added-EGLINAFB) During subsequent 5-year terms of the MS4 permit,
         status reports are only required to be submitted to the regulatory agency after years 2
         and 4 of the permit. Status reports are due within six months of the anniversary date
         of permit coverage.
     2.2.2.4. (Added-EGLINAFB) All proposed activities on Eglin AFB property that
     include construction, alteration, or removal of Stormwater Management Systems (for
     definition, see Terms in Attachment 1), shall be evaluated to determine if the activity
     qualifies for an Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) according to Chapter 62-346,
     Florida Administrative Code or can be exempted. Work that requires permitting shall not
     be started until permit is issued.
         2.2.2.4.1. (Added-EGLINAFB) Proposed activities that qualify for an ERP, must
         notify the appropriate regulatory agency (either FDEP or NWFWMD) before
         initiating work. The notice shall be on the proper form as designated in Chapter 62-
         346 F.A.C.
         2.2.2.4.2. (Added-EGLINAFB) When projects with ERP permits are completed,
         the permittee shall submit an ―As-Built Certification by a Registered Professional‖
         and a ―Request for Conversion of Stormwater Management Construction Phase to
         Operation and Maintenance Phase‖ within 30 days as designated in Chapter 62-346

          2.2.3.1.1. (Added-EGLINAFB) DMRs shall be submitted to FDEP no later than the
          28th day of each month.
      2.2.3.2. Discharges to Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) and HN Treatment
      Facilities. Installations that discharge to permitted POTWs are considered as secondary
      dischargers and are regulated by the POTW authority. They must comply with applicable
      POTW regulations, permits, and contractual agreements. Overseas installations
      discharging to local or regional treatment plants must comply with applicable standards
      in the FGS or OEBGD.
      2.2.3.3. Permits. When first applying for or renewing a permit, installations will review
      the draft permit requirements proposed by the regulatory agency to ensure they are
      reasonable and achievable. If conditions in a draft permit could be amended to better suit
      Air Force needs, or are unacceptable or unachievable, negotiate these issues in close
      coordination between installation JA and CE. Overseas locations coordinate with your
      MAJCOM for consultation with the DoD EEA.
      2.2.3.4. Water Treatment Residuals Disposal. A NPDES permit must cover direct
      discharges from swimming pool filter backwash water and water treatment residuals,
      including sludge and process wastewater from drinking water treatment plants, into
      waters of the United States.*
   2.2.4. Report water quality enforcement actions in accordance with AFI 32-7047. Resolve
   all NPDES or HN permit violations within the regulatory agency’s time frame. Maintain
   records of written correspondence and oral communication with the regulators in accordance
   with AFI 32-7047. Develop a management action plan, coordinate it with the regulatory
   agency, and resolve outstanding deficiencies in a timely manner.
      2.2.4.1. (Added-EGLINAFB) When a non-compliance report is being sent to a
      regulator as a result of a discharge permit exceedance at Eglin, copies of the report or
      coordination must be provided to 96 CEG/CEV. Many permit deficiencies often require
      a written plan be provided to the regulator when non-compliance of a permit condition
      happens, this plan should include the cause of the problem and corrective measures.
      2.2.4.2. (Added-EGLINAFB) For any case of non-compliance (stormwater or
      wastewater), 96 CEG/CEV should provide HQ AFMC/A7AI a copy of the applicable
      non-compliance report narrative provided to the regulator. It is not necessary to send the
      entire discharge monitoring report, only the non-compliance narrative should suffice.
      The report narrative should be provided at the time the discharge monitoring reports are
      submitted to the regulator, assuming that formal reporting at a higher level is not
      necessary. These reports are used to monitor trends and support projects.
2.3. Federal Facility Compliance Agreements (FFCA). *
   2.3.1. The installation JA will negotiate realistic interim discharge standards and an
   achievable schedule for short-term corrective measures and long-term compliance, in close
   coordination with CE.
   2.3.2. An executed FFCA does not eliminate current noncompliance; it only temporarily
   allows discharges to exceed certain permit conditions.
   2.3.3. Failure to comply with FFCAs may lead to additional enforcement actions.
AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 32-7041_EGLINAFBSUP_I 16 JUNE 2010                                    13

                      SEWAGE DISCHARGE CONTINGENCY PLAN

A3.1. (EGLINAFB) Purpose and Overview. This plan assigns tasks and responsibilities to
organizations in the event of a sewage discharge occurring on Eglin AFB. Sewage discharge is
defined as any unauthorized release of domestic wastewater, whether treated or untreated, from
any pipe, device, or facility. This also includes discharges from septic tanks, oil water separators
and grease traps. The plan establishes responsibilities for sewage discharges, whether occurring
on main base, military family housing or on the Eglin Reservation. Hurlburt Field is not within
the scope of this plan. It is organized into the following sequences of action from discovery to
clean-up.
Initial Discovery
Discharge Containment
Initial Regulatory Notification
Follow-up Notification
Site Clean-up
A3.2. (EGLINAFB) Initial Discovery Responsibilities. Base personnel who discover a
sewage discharge shall dial 911. After notification of the discharge, the security police or fire
department shall, based on the scope and potential danger involved, respond either directly to the
discharge or notify one or more of the following offices within the 96th Civil Engineer Group for
response; Exterior Plumbing, 882-3376 for all Base areas (not including Housing), and Housing
Maintenance, 882-8589 for Military Housing Areas. An exception to this is, if the discharge is
discovered by 96th Civil Engineer Group personnel, the appropriate office may respond directly
to the discharge.
   A3.2.1. (EGLINAFB) When notified of the sewage discharge, the appropriate 96th Civil
   Engineer Group office (as designated above), shall respond as quickly as possible to
   minimize and stop the sewage outflow. Phone numbers and points of contact required for
   Environmental Management (96 CEG/ CEVCE) notifications during duty hours and non-
   duty hours can be found in Section A3.7 of this attachment. Off-base regulatory offices are
   listed in Section A3.8 of this attachment. As soon as it is feasible (usually less than two
   hours of initial notification), the offices listed below shall be contacted as appropriate. This
   is necessary to avoid regulatory enforcement actions for exceeding the 24-hour notification
   requirement to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).
       A3.2.1.1. (EGLINAFB) 96 CEG/CEVCE (882-7660) within 2 hours of discovery, to
       ensure required 24-hour notification(s) to regulators.

                             Attachment 4 (Added-EGLINAFB)
    INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER CONTROL PLAN (ACTIVITIES/FACILITIES)

A4.1. (EGLINAFB) Purpose and Overview. This plan provides guidance for handling
wastewaters generated by specific industrial processes located on Eglin AFB. The plan applies
to discharges occurring on main base, military family housing or on the Eglin Reservation.
Hurlburt Field is not within the scope of this plan. If shop personnel have any doubts about the
content of wastewater generated from a specific industrial process, representative samples should
be taken and analyzed to assist in deciding the proper disposal procedures. Any new sources of
industrial wastewater generated on Eglin AFB, must first have authorization from 96
CEG/CEVCE and the Wastewater Treatment Plant lead operator before being discharged into the
sanitary sewer.
A4.2. (EGLINAFB) Fire Suppression and Fire Fighting Training. Aqueous film-forming
foam (AFFF) is a water miscible, clear, amber-colored liquid used at military installations to
combat aircraft fuel-related fires. AFFF is used by crash rescue vehicles in responding to
runway and terminal accidents and in foam-water sprinkler systems in fuel storage areas and in
aircraft hangars. In addition to AFFF having a high organic loading, it causes foaming at
wastewater treatment facilities. Discharge of wastewater containing AFFF to surface waters is
not permitted except in emergency conditions, when spill prevention, control, and counter
measures normally are implemented. Non-emergency discharges of AFFF must be contained
and not allowed to enter the base stormwater drainage system or nearby surface waters. For
example, small amounts of AFFF wastewaters in the Climatic Laboratory are drained to a lined
holding pond before being released to the wastewater treatment plant at a prescribed rate (with
prior notification and approval) or hauled in tanker trucks to an industrial wastewater treatment
plant. 96 CEG Flight Management Plan 32-12 contains additional instructions regarding AFFF
releases. High expansion (Hi-Ex) type foams are replacing AFFF in a few applications on base,
such as hangar fire suppression. Although these materials pose less potential hazards on the
environment, similar precautions should be taken when handling releases and spills.
A4.3. (EGLINAFB) Aircraft Maintenance. Potential industrial pollutant sources associated
with aircraft maintenance services performed on base include: non-destructive structural integrity
testing, aircraft washing, aircraft painting and engine cleaning.
   A4.3.1. (EGLINAFB) Non-Destructive Testing. This type of testing may generate
   wastewater containing high COD and heavy metals which will impact the wastewater
   treatment system if discharged into the sewer system.
   A4.3.2. (EGLINAFB) Aircraft Washing.             Some aircraft cleaning solutions contain
   relatively high concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and solvents. Typical wastewater
   contaminants include fuel, oils, lubricants, detergents and heavy metals. Steam cleaners
   discharge approximately 2 GPM over a washing period of 10 minutes, for a total wash water
   of 20 gallons per engine, typically. Spilling only a modest quantity of full strength cleaner
   poses a potential risk of treatment interference. Bulk storage practices should be designed to
   minimize the risk of spillage. In the event a spill should occur, the spill plan should
   recognize the need to contain and recover, not to hose the material down a drain. As with
   other washing operations, aircraft wash waters may be considered a dilute effluent which
   poses acceptable risk to the treatment plants. Within the limits of the applicable technical
 42               AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 32-7041_EGLINAFBSUP_I 16 JUNE 2010


   orders, levels of pollutant loadings to treatment plants could be reduced through the use of
   aircraft cleaners with the least impact to treatment plant operations and phase out of those
   with the highest. Note: clear water aircraft rinses (no detergent, relatively low pressure) to
   remove salt accumulation are approved on the flight line and apron areas as long as the
   runoff percolates or evaporates prior to entering surface waters or wetlands. This clear water
   rinse exemption was approved by FDEP in a letter dated 9 Jul 01 which can be found in the
   Eglin AFB Environmental Document System, in the ―Permits – Waste Water‖ tab.
   A4.3.3. (EGLINAFB) Aircraft Painting. Painting operations usually generate only a small
   amount of wastewater. Sources of wastewater include paint stripping, floor wash down and
   spray-gun cleaning. Pollution prevention usually focuses on improved painting techniques to
   reduce overspray, and minimizing use of solvent paint thinners and cleanup solvents. The
   use of plastic media blasting (PMB) paint stripping as an alternative to conventional solvent
   stripping has also been successfully implemented at many military facilities.
   A4.3.4. (EGLINAFB) Engine Washing. Wastewater generated from engine washing
   activities contains contaminants including fuels, oils, lubricants, detergents and heavy metals.
   All engine washing activities at Eglin AFB are required to be conducted in a contained area.
   The wash water shall not be allowed to runoff into the storm drainage system or surface
   waters. If OWS are used to help remove wash water contaminates, the OWS should be
   regularly inspected and properly maintained. Periodically, and in accordance with Base
   hazardous waste management procedures, the engine rinse water should be tested for
   hazardous constituents.
A4.4. (EGLINAFB) Battery Maintenance. Battery maintenance shops on Base rinse and
store lead/acid batteries and nickel cadmium batteries. The rinse water is collected in a sink,
neutralized, and pH tested prior to being discharged into the sanitary sewer. Typical
contaminants include heavy metals, sulfuric acid, sodium bicarbonate and detergents. Special
care should be taken to store batteries in a containment area away from floor drains.
A4.5. (EGLINAFB) Engine Test. There are opportunities for fuel and oil leaks associated
with setting up and testing each engine at jet engine test firing facilities on Base. Although drip
pans and bowsers are used to contain such leaks, often small quantities of petroleum products are
released to surrounding floors. Jet fuels and lubricating oils would exert a potentially toxic
impact on an activated sludge system at the treatment plant, pose a threat of flammability, and
could be released as volatile organic emissions by the treatment process. Engine test cells that
have floor drains leading to the sanitary sewer system must have an OWS installed. Cleaning
methods such as dry-sweeping small petroleum spills should be employed rather than floor
rinsing.
A4.6. (EGLINAFB) Fuel Storage. Fuels management recovers water condensation from JP-8
storage tanks on Base. Water is decanted from the tank bottoms, often on a daily basis, and
separated from the fuel. The fuel portion is returned to the POL tank, and the water portion is
then taken to the Eglin Recycle Center as petroleum contact water and placed into an
underground storage tank (UST). When the UST is nearly full, water is drained off the bottom
and processed through an oil water separator and is finally discharged to the sanitary sewer
system. Water containing small amounts of POL may also be generated from the secondary
containment structures surrounding fuel transfer and ASTs. Stormwater in containment areas is
checked for petroleum sheen, if none is present, the water is drained to the surrounding soils. If
AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 32-7041_EGLINAFBSUP_I 16 JUNE 2010                                           43


the stormwater contains an oily sheen, the tank custodian is required to remove the
contamination before releasing the water and determine the cause. Similarly, when fuel tank
trucks require maintenance they are flushed with water which is then discharged through an oil
water separator into the sanitary sewer system.
A4.7. (EGLINAFB) Hospital Operations. Hospital operations on Base include
OR/Sterilization, Clinical Lab, and Tissue Analysis, X-ray development and dental clinic.
Possible pollutant discharges from hospital operations on Base include Formalin and various
disinfectants/sterilizers. It is possible Hospitals discharge low levels of heavy metals and toxic
organics primarily through the use of laboratory reagents, disinfectants and preservatives.
However, these discharges are expected to be well controlled by lab-type settings in which very
high standards of process control, materials handling, spill control and program of
recovery/recycle of selected wastes implemented on Base.
A4.8. (EGLINAFB) Maintenance Area Floor Washing. Floor washing is conducted in
various maintenance areas on Base. Biodegradable floor cleaners are used for floor washing
throughout the Base. The aircraft maintenance hangars perform floor washing activities which
generates a wastewater stream at each facility. The vehicle maintenance facilities conduct floor
washing on a routine basis. The volume and contaminants contained in the floor washing waters
are expected to be dependent on the method of floor washing, the floor area, and the type of
activities being conducted in the building. Contaminants in vehicle maintenance floor washing
wastewaters typically include residual oil, fuel, hydraulic fluid, antifreeze, lubricants, degreasers,
and other maintenance-related fluids as well as the liquid biodegradable cleaners which are
known to have high BOD and COD values. Due to its high BOD and COD values, the use of
biodegradable cleaners should be limited. Good housekeeping practices and pollution prevention
techniques should be considered and implemented to control floor wash water discharges.
A4.9. (EGLINAFB) Parts Washing. The facilities on Base that perform parts washing
use/store some quantity of solvent degreasing compounds. Potential pollutants from these
operations include fuel, oil, hydraulic fluids, petroleum distillates, heavy metals, organic solvents
and detergent cleaning agents. For most facilities the parts washing operation is a small portion
of overall shop activities. In some cases, no wastewater discharge results from the parts washing
operation. When a waste stream is generated, it is usually intermixed with other waste streams
from the facility.       Discharge collection/treatment practices on Base include solvent
recovery/recycle through ―closed loop‖ vendors; waste solvent turn-in as hazardous waste and
prevention strategies (spill control, protected storage, housekeeping standards). Accidental spills
and inappropriate disposal of accumulated waste are the primary potential sources of discharges
which could conceivably contribute to treatment plant interference.
A4.10. (EGLINAFB) Photo/X-ray Processing. Within the group of photo and X-ray
processing shops at Eglin AFB, only a few operations produce waste streams and operate at a
scale comparable to the minimum process rate to which EPA categorical standards apply. These
categorical standards identify silver, cyanide compounds (CN) and pH as the pollutants of
concern. Most of the small shops recover spent developer and fixative solutions for turn-in and
thus generate no wastewater discharge. At all locations, accidental spills of stored material or
accumulated wastes constitute the primary threat of excessive discharge.
A4.11. (EGLINAFB) Heat Plants/Cooling Towers and Laundries. The base operates
numerous boilers and cooling towers which employ a variety of water treatment chemicals in
 44                AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 32-7041_EGLINAFBSUP_I 16 JUNE 2010


order to control corrosion scaling and microbe growth. Routine discharges from these systems
(containing water treatment chemicals) have the potential of interfering with the wastewater
treatment plant operations. All new treatment chemicals should be evaluated for their impact on
the treatment system before purchase and use. Laundry facilities also release quantities of spent
detergent and bleach on a continuous basis throughout the day. Such waste streams are
categorized as dilute sources which are not likely to cause interference at receiving treatment
plants by the USEPA pretreatment standards.
A4.12. (EGLINAFB) Vehicle Maintenance. Vehicle maintenance facilities on Base will
perform any of the basic following activities: preventative inspections, maintenance, washing in
outdoor wash racks, barrel rising, intermittent parts cleaning and floor cleaning on a daily basis.
Normally, maintenance operations do not discharge an industrial wastewater stream. This type
of activity is associated with potential pollutant including brake, transmission, power steering, or
differential fluids, antifreeze, gasoline, oil, etc. These amounts can be substantial and all such
fluids should be stringently accounted for and controlled so as to prevent spills or accidental
releases that might interfere with the wastewater treatment plants. All fluids are accumulated by
each facility and turned in through the waste oil program or other appropriate channels.
Negligible discharges to the sanitary sewer will be achieved by applying good housekeeping
practices at all times. Many of the larger maintenance facilities are connected to an OWS which
must be inspected regularly and properly maintained.
A4.13. (EGLINAFB) Vehicle and Equipment Washing. Equipment being serviced by
vehicle wash racks on Base include the motor pool and personal vehicles, AGE equipment, CE
equipment, trucks, trailers and heavy equipment. Depending on the types of items cleaned and
the volume of water used at wash racks, pretreatment processes may be necessary. An oil water
separator and/or grit removal system are typical pretreatment methods. These however can be
problematic, principally when strong detergents are used that emulsify oils. Pretreatment can be
reduced or even eliminated when water only or steam cleaning only are utilized. Many of the
problems associated with wash racks are lack of inspections and maintenance of oil water
separators and grit interceptors.
A4.14. (EGLINAFB) Pesticides Management and Hazardous Waste Storage Facility. The
use of floor drains linked to containments tanks should be used at pesticide mixing and storage
facilities to avoid any accidental discharge of spilled materials.
A4.15. (EGLINAFB) Mechanisms for Pollutant Discharges. The primary mechanism for
pollutants associated with the above facilities/activities entering the Base’s wastewater treatment
system is as follows:
   A4.15.1. (EGLINAFB) Inappropriate Work Practices. Inappropriate work practices related
   with the above-referenced facilities/activities commonly discharge significant amounts of
   pollutants to the wastewater collection system. The use of these inappropriate work practices
   are sometimes considered standard operating procedures but are in fact unacceptable
   measures in accordance with base-wide Best Management Practices (BMP) and Eglin AFB
   Contingency Plans. Washing heavy petroleum products, such as greases, into wash rack
   drains and creating excessive water flows that may over load OWS are two examples of
   inappropriate work practices.
   A4.15.2. (EGLINAFB) Accidental Spills. The most common spills on Base are those of
   small quantities which are perceived as insignificant and therefore not contained and properly
AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 32-7041_EGLINAFBSUP_I 16 JUNE 2010                                     45


  cleaned. This type of small quantity spill is typically washed down a sink or floor drain that
  lead directly into the wastewater collection system. The accumulation of the many small
  quantity spills in the base wide facilities may result in significant consequences to WWTP
  operations.
  A4.15.3. (EGLINAFB) Inappropriate Disposal. The discharge of small amounts of mixed
  waste chemicals down a sink drain from a laboratory or the deliberate disposal of waste
  petroleum products down floor drains of maintenance facilities are two examples of
  inappropriate disposals of accumulated waste. The main reason for these deliberate,
  inappropriate disposal practices is due to the lack of waste disposal training and the
  misinterpretations regarding what are acceptable disposal practices for sanitary sewers. Shop
  supervisors are encouraged to contact 96 CEG/CEVCE for in-shop training or personnel may
  take A3 classes, including two excellent videos (EM-201 Environmental Management
  System and EM-103 Storm Water Pollution Prevention Awareness).
