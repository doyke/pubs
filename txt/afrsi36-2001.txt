   1.2.12. Not sponsor an alien for permanent residence in the United States by citing the Air
   Force as a prospective employer. In addition, recruiting personnel will not recruit in a
   foreign country unless invited by the government (specifically Canada and Mexico). Some
   countries have laws forbidding the armed forces of a foreign state to recruit in their country,
   such as Canada‘s ―Foreign Enlistment Act.‖
1.3. Prohibitions on Unprofessional Relationships. Recruiters will maintain high standards of
conduct and be totally professional in their relationships with applicants, recruits, and RAPpers.
These standards of conduct apply to relationships with any applicant/recruit/RAPper, regardless
of whether a recruiter is the actual recruiter of the applicant/recruit/RAPper or involved with the
accession of the applicant/recruit/RAPper in any way. For purposes of this paragraph,
applicant/recruit includes any and all branches of DoD service. The status of an applicant/recruit
is not terminated until the withdrawal and termination is approved and documented by the
recruiter‘s flight chief or a higher authority. Recruiters will:

   1.3.9. Not use grade or position, threats, pressure, or return of favors or favorable treatment
   in an attempt to gain sexual favors or any wrongful gain or favors from an applicant, recruit,
   or RAPper.
   1.3.10. Not engage in any verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that creates an
   intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. (Note:) Each recruiter will ensure he or she
   signs AFRS Form 6, Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Briefing, with the applicant.
   The recruiter will then put the form in the applicant‘s case file to the MEPS. (The form is
   available in the Air Force Recruiting Information Support System [AFRISS].) MEPS
   personnel keep the form in the case file package. They send the original form to BMT upon
   the applicant‘s EAD and keep a copy in the residual file.
   1.3.11. Not use personal resources to provide applicants/recruits/RAPpers with lodging or
   transportation.
   1.3.12. Not accept an applicant‘s personal belongings or household goods for any reason.
   1.3.13. Not solicit donations (other than for official Air Force campaigns) from a recruit,
   applicant, or RAPper.
1.4. Irregularity. Irregularity is defined as any other failure to follow recruiting procedures not
covered under paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 of this section that causes a prospect, applicant, or recruit
to be misinformed about any aspect of the recruiting or enlistment process, policies, procedures,
entitlements, and benefits.
1.5. Referring Complaints. Persons with policy and procedure complaints will not be advised,
instructed, or otherwise assisted by recruiting personnel in contacting congressional
representatives, HQ AFRS at Randolph AFB TX, BMT recruiting liaison (HQ AFRS/RSOPQ) at
Lackland AFB TX, or a personnel processing squadron at Lackland AFB TX. Recruiting
personnel will promptly refer all complaints that cannot be resolved and questions that cannot be
answered to their immediate supervisor. If the immediate supervisor is not available, recruiting
personnel will promptly elevate the complaints through the chain of command. They will not
release names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers of personnel or offices above the
squadron-commander level.
1.6. Referring Inquiries. Recruiting personnel will not respond to official inquiries,
allegations, or complaints received directly from Air Force members, parents, legal officials, or
legislative representatives from any level of government, except as authorized by HQ AFRS/IG.
Instead, recruiting personnel will immediately refer all such inquiries to their unit‘s commander,
who will address them directly or forward them to the appropriate office or agency for further
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                      17


action. For congressional inquiries, commanders will submit a draft response to HQ AFRS/IGQ
who will prepare the official response through SAF/LL to the congressional representative.
1.7. Recruiting Service Investigations. Recruiting personnel will provide any and all
pertinent, available information to investigating officers or other representatives duly appointed
to conduct investigations and will otherwise fully cooperate with them.
1.8. Reporting and Investigating Violations.
   1.8.1. Recruiting personnel will immediately report actual or suspected violations of the
   prohibitions or irregularities prescribed in paragraphs 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 to their unit‘s
   commander. Recruiting group and squadron commanders will ensure all allegations or
   complaints of suspected violations or irregularities (including allegations forwarded from the
   US Military Entrance Processing Command [USMEPCOM] and military entrance processing
   stations [MEPS]) are investigated. The decision to conduct a formal investigation rests with
   the individual commander. However, he or she should only make this decision after
   consulting with the servicing base legal office or HQ AFRS/JA.
   1.8.2. The group or squadron commander initiating an investigation (or his or her
   designated representative) must notify HQ AFRS/JA that an investigation has been initiated,
   provide the name of the appointed investigating officer if a Commander Directed
   Investigation (CDI) is ordered, and obtain guidance concerning the proper procedures for
   conducting and documenting the investigation. Commanders will also ensure CDI
   investigating officers obtain legal advice and guidance from HQ AFRS/JA or their servicing
   base legal office before conducting the investigation. In all cases, commanders must keep
   HQ AFRS/JA informed on all aspects of each investigation and command action.
   1.8.3. Prior to a determination on the merits of the investigative findings of a CDI and an
   administrative or disciplinary command action, commanders will obtain a written legal
   review of the report of investigation (ROI) from their servicing base legal office or HQ
   AFRS/JA.
   1.8.4. On completion of any commander-directed investigation, commanders will ensure HQ
   AFRS/JA is provided a copy of the ROI and any command action. If the HQ AFRS/IG
   referred the investigation to the commander, the commander will ensure the HQ AFRS/IG is
   also notified by a summarized result of findings and command action. This notification may
   include a copy of the ROI.
Section 1B—Management Guidelines
1.9. Returning Persons in Absent Without Leave (AWOL) or Deserter Status to Military
Control. If a person claiming to be in AWOL or deserter status telephones a recruiting office,
the recruiter will ask the caller for his or her name, branch of service, last unit assigned, and
social security number (SSN). No suggestions or advice will be given. The recruiter will then
call the member‘s squadron and give the information to the first sergeant, superintendent, or
commander. The first sergeant will then contact the member‘s unit or nearest service component
base law enforcement desk for further guidance. If information on the member‘s unit is
unavailable, the same first sergeant will contact the nearest military installation security police
unit for instructions. Note: The same procedures apply if the person walks into a recruiting
office and claims to be AWOL or a deserter.
 18                                                             AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


1.10. Handling Personnel Who Become Disqualified or Refuse To Ship After Taking the
Oath of Enlistment. If an Airman swears in and is subsequently disqualified or refuses to ship
to basic training, notify HQ AFRS/RSOPB (Job Bank) and take one of the following actions:
   1.10.1. If the Airman is still at the MEPS: The AF liaison and airman must complete
   Section 1 of AF Form 31. Once the form is completed the MEPS liaison will complete AF
   Form 100 and send both completed forms to the Squadron Operations responsible for
   accessing the Airman (losing squadron for courtesy shippers) for Squadron Commander
   review and endorsement.
   1.10.2. If Airman has left the MEPS: The AF liaison will notify the Squadron Operations
   responsible for accessing the Airman (losing squadron for courtesy shippers). Squadron
   Operations will make arrangements to have applicant complete Section 1 of AF Form 31.
   Once the form is completed Squadron Operations will complete AF Form 100 and provide
   both completed forms to the Squadron Commander for review and endorsement.
   1.10.3. Squadron Operations will FAX a copy of the completed AF Form 31 and AF Form
   100 to HQ AFRS Job Bank. Once receipt is confirmed mail the originals to: HQ
   AFRS/RSOPB, 550 D. Street West, Ste. 1, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4527.
1.11. Air Force Recruiting Information Support System (AFRISS). AFRISS (L, R, or TF)
will be used to conduct processing activities to include loading Priority 1 leads, refining Priority
1 and Priority 2 leads, building applicant case files, MEPS Scheduling (Medical/Testing), credit
checks, applicant and DEP Follow-ups, loading and distributing goals, running waivers and
eligibility determinations (EDs), loading and assigning school and institution priorities, and to
suspend and close applicant records. All other AFRISS functions are optional, dependent upon
Group or Squadron Management guidance.
1.11.1. In the event AFRISS becomes unavailable for an extended period of time, AFRS Forms
1319, Personal Interview Record, 1319A, Personal Interview Record (Continued), and 1340,
Lead Refinement Record, will be manually accomplished to ensure uninterrupted applicant
processing.
1.12. Interservice Recruitment Committee (IRC): An IRC is a committee of all Services
battalion, squadron, and area commanders who utilize the same MEPS. All Services
commanders are voting members and committee chair usually rotates amongst commanders at an
agreed interval. MEPS commanders are non-voting members of the IRC.
   1.12.1. Voting members are responsible for resolving all problems related to MEPS
   processing (mental testing, physical examinations, processing schedules, applicant
   transportation, meals, lodging, etc.) at the local level.
   1.12.2. Squadron commanders should attend all IRC meetings. If they cannot attend due to
   emergency leave, higher headquarters TDY, or some higher priority schedule conflict (that
   cannot be resolved) a designated squadron representative will attend. Squadron and
   Production superintendents, MEPS liaison supervisors (MLSs), and other squadron personnel
   are encouraged to attend. Squadron commanders will ensure a copy of the IRC minutes is
   sent to their operations flight.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                    19


   1.12.3. Squadron commanders will take immediate action to resolve problems at the lowest
   level. Problems that cannot be resolved locally will be elevated through the chain of
   command.
   1.12.4. Group commanders will take immediate action to resolve issues through the mid-
   level IRC (MIRC). Issues that cannot be resolved through the MIRC will be elevated to HQ
   AFRS/RSOP. They will ensure a copy of their mid-level interservice recruitment committee
   (MIRC) minutes is sent to HQ AFRS/RSOPA.
1.13. Test Control Officer (TCO). Squadron commanders will appoint, by memorandum, their
operations flight commander or support flight commander as the unit TCO.
1.14. Recruiter Zone Map (RZM):
   1.14.1. HQ AFRS/RSOAM (Market Analysis) is the OPR for the RZM and will provide
   specific procedural guidelines for updating and maintaining the RZM.
   1.14.2. HQ AFRS/RSOA (Analysis Branch) will maintain an electronic RZM designed to
   reflect the boundaries of each recruiter‘s zone. The RZM is the key element in distributing
   leads and Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) High School Testing
   Program data to recruiters in a timely fashion. The RZM is also the cornerstone for flight
   and recruiter zone-level market analysis activities; it must accurately reflect the geographic
   boundaries of each recruiter‘s zone.
   1.14.3. Squadrons are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the zone boundaries within
   their squadron and flights. When recruiter zone modifications do not require an AFRS Form
   1399, ZIP Code changes within the same flight or squadron must be submitted electronically
   with a requested effective date to AFRS/RSOAM. When recruiter zones/billets are created,
   deleted or realigned, ZIP Code assignments and all applicable source documents must
   accompany the AFRS/RSXXM AFRISS/Operations Data Worksheet and the AFRS Form
   1399, Air Force Recruiting Service Authorization Change Request. AFRS Form 1399 is
   prescribed in AFRSI 38-201, Air Force Recruiting Service Operational Organization. Refer
   to AFRSI 38-201 for guidance on filling out the AFRS Form 1399.
      1.14.3.1. Poaching is the occurrence of a recruiter processing an applicant who,
      otherwise, based on market surveys, zone boundaries, school assignment (i.e., High
      School, College, Medical School, etc.), and/or local instructions, rightfully belongs to
      another recruiter. When an applicant rightly belongs to another recruiter, the applicant
      must be referred to the appropriate recruiter for processing. When poaching is alleged,
      and it cannot be amicably resolved, it will be mitigated by the lowest level of the
      appropriate authority. If the appropriate production superintendent(s) cannot resolve a
      dispute, the case will be forwarded to the appropriate group superintendent(s) for
      resolution. The AFRS/RSO superintendent will decide disputes not resolved at the group
      level.
1.15. Market Surveys:
   1.15.1. Recruiters and flight chiefs are responsible for conducting and maintaining a market
   survey for their areas of geographic responsibility. Flight chiefs will complete the market
   survey for all ―open‖ zones. Recruiters will load demographic information on all schools
   into AFRISS. Recruiters will complete the market survey (AFRS Form 1368, Officer
 20                                                            AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   Accessions Market Survey, or AFRS Form 1389, Market Survey Information), appropriate for
   their assigned zone.
   1.15.2. Flight chiefs will maintain a copy of each recruiter‘s market surveys. They will
   consolidate the information on an appropriate market survey form and forward a copy to the
   responsible operations flight. Market surveys will be completed annually and sent to the
   responsible operations flight no later than (NLT) 30 December of each year or when
   significant changes occur.
   1.15.3. New recruiters and supervisors will review and update the market surveys with their
   supervisor within 90 days of arrival. The flight chief will establish procedures to validate at
   least 50 percent of the market data in each flight and officer program. Flight chief will attach
   a record of the validation to the market surveys and send the package to the responsible
   operations flight. The term ―market‖ refers to factors used in goaling formulas, such as high
   school seniors for net reservation goaling, electrical engineering students for line officer
   (LO) goaling and residency participants for HP physician goaling. Fully qualified markets
   need not be validated unless they are used as a goaling factor.
   1.15.4. The responsible operations flight will review the market surveys for accuracy and
   provide written feedback to flight chiefs for corrective action. They will suspense corrective
   actions for follow-up to ensure compliance. In addition, production superintendents will
   determine how to use the results to ensure fair and equitable goaling.
   1.15.5. The responsible operations flight will validate at least 10 percent of each flight‘s
   market for goaling purposes, documenting and filing the validation with the market surveys.
   Fully qualified HP and LO markets need not be validated unless they are used as a goaling
   factor.
1.16. Goal Allocation, Competition System, and Incentive Awards Programs. HQ AFRS
will publish policies and procedures in support of these programs. The AFRS Commander is the
final approval authority. Groups will publish instructions that reflect the current FY program
priorities after receipt of HQ AFRS publications. Squadrons will publish instructions that reflect
the current FY program priorities after receipt of group publications. Each flight chief will
maintain OIs on goal allocation, competition, and incentive award programs. Each flight chief
will ensure their recruiters understand the information contained in the OIs. OIs must be
reviewed at least annually for accuracy. Unless otherwise specified by HQ AFRS, all goaled
programs will be allocated to the recruiter level. Goaling authorities will not hold or distribute
more goal cumulatively than goal allocated. Nonprior service (NPS) enlisted accession (EA) net
reservation goals will be distributed monthly.
   1.16.1. Factors Used To Goal Squadrons. HQ AFRS will develop and distribute all goals
   for the group with suggested goals to the squadrons. When goaling squadrons; market,
   manning, and past production are factors that may be used to help ensure fair and equitable
   goaling.
   1.16.2. Factors Used To Goal Flights and Recruiters. Squadrons and flights should use
   market, manning, and propensity as primary factors when distributing goals. EA new
   enlistment contracts will be distributed monthly. When recruiters take leave, go TDY, or are
   absent due to a verified medical illness, their goals may be adjusted. Production flight chiefs
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                       21


   will publish flight goals, and allocate them to the recruiter level. Team Goaling is Not
   Authorized.
1.17. Planning. To ensure proper time management and productivity, recruiters must plan their
activities in advance to include daily, weekly, monthly, and annual planning. A planning guide
must be used (AFRISS or any other automated option approved by the production
superintendent) and at least twelve months‘ worth of completed planning guide documents must
be maintained at all times. Production superintendents will set written guidance outlining
activities that must be planned and to what extent activities will cross-reference with other
documents for verification/audit purposes.
1.18. Expectations:
   1.18.1. EA Program. EA flight chiefs:
       1.18.1.1. Will set written expectations for ALL of their recruiters. Note: Expectations
       can be production, marketing, awareness, relationship building school visit, etc related.
       1.18.1.2. Will set written applicant-generating activity expectations for their recruiters in
       training and recruiters who are year-to-date, not-across-the-board (NATB) of New
       Enlistment Contract (NEC) goal. Production analysis data, along with the recruiter‘s
       goal, success and loss rates will be used to derive expectations. Once expectations are
       derived, flight chiefs may adjust to meet mission requirements. Note: Production
       Superintendents may, through written guidance, require applicant-generating activity
       expectations be levied on ALL recruiters regardless of training or production status.
       1.18.1.3. Will review performance against expectations for ALL recruiters, provide
       written feedback on a weekly basis, and make adjustments based on the recruiter‘s
       production activity and or workload. Note: Production Superintendents may authorize
       flight chiefs to use AFRISS or the AFRS Form 1484, Recruiter Daily Activity Log, to
       track a recruiter‘s daily activity.
       1.18.1.4. Are responsible for directing the use of recruiting tools in sufficient volume and
       frequency to ensure enough applicant-generating activities and a consistent flow to the
       MEPS is generated to achieve assigned goals. Note: A written copy of the flight chief‘s
       expectations, the recruiter‘s performance and the flight chief‘s feedback will be kept on
       file for 2 years in accordance with the Air Force RDS, Table 36.10, Rule 10.
   1.18.2. OA Program. HP and LO flight chiefs: Note: The term LO flight chief refers to
   anyone qualified and appointed to perform flight chief duties applicable to the proper
   guidance and supervision of LO recruiters (normally Sq Senior Trainer).
       1.18.2.1. Will set written monthly applicant-generating activity expectations and
       quarterly application flow expectations for their recruiters. Production analysis data,
       along with the recruiter‘s goal, success and loss rates, and critical timing of flow will be
       used to derive expectations. (Consult program announcements and board schedules.)
       Once expectations are derived, flight chiefs may adjust them if they feel the expectations
       are unrealistic.
       1.18.2.2. Will review performance against established expectations and provide feedback
       on a weekly basis for all recruiters and make adjustments based on the recruiter‘s
       production requirements.
 22                                                            AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


       1.18.2.3. Are responsible for directing the use of all recruiting tools in sufficient volume
       and frequency to ensure a consistent application flow to HQ AFRS is generated to

1.20. An Overview of Customer Service Standards. Recruiting personnel will render the
highest level of courtesy, professionalism, and customer service at all times when dealing with
applicants, influencers, and the American public. Consistent high levels of customer service
provide a competitive advantage and are essential to continued Air Force recruiting success in an
increasingly aggressive marketplace.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                   23


1.21. Elements of Successful Squadron Customer Service Programs. Customer service
programs serve as a powerful force-multiplier for recruiters. Squadrons will employ all (but are
not limited to) the following tools and techniques:
   1.21.1. Customer Feedback Mechanisms. Squadron leadership or designated
   representatives will maintain customer feedback mechanisms and augment them with random
   phone surveys. It is important to regularly receive customer input on successes and failures
   of recruiting operations.
   1.21.2. Metrics. Squadron commanders will track key customer service trend data to
   identify areas for improvement. They will review and discuss metrics during quarterly
   management meetings and performance feedback sessions with appropriate personnel
   involved with direct customer service. Metrics will change as analysis identifies negative
   trends in processes. Metrics might include, but are not limited to measuring: (Note:
   Squadron commanders will compile the results of their metric reviews and report process
   improvements [where indicated] to group commanders, who will, in turn, review each
   squadron in their respective group.)
       1.21.2.1. Internal customer satisfaction (MEPS, marketing, support personnel).
       1.21.2.2. Overall applicant satisfaction with individual recruiter performance.
       1.21.2.3. Inspector general (IG), basic military training (BMT), and congressional
       complaint history.
       1.21.2.4. Applicant MEPS processing satisfaction.
       1.21.2.5. Recruiter avoidable losses (RAL).
       1.21.2.6. Waiver processing satisfaction.
       1.21.2.7. DEP customer satisfaction.
       1.21.2.8. Refusals and declinations.

       1.21.2.11. Community/influencer relationships/partnerships
   1.21.3. Customer Service ―Benchmark. ‖ Identify and adopt useful customer service best
   practices. Many individual recruiters and flights have developed highly innovative and
   successful approaches to enhance their customer service. Commanders are highly
   encouraged to promote the sharing of these best practices so overall levels of command
   customer service are increased.
   1.21.4. Education and Training. Regular customer service training for all assigned
   personnel is a command responsibility. While not required, such training is normally
   documented on an AF IMT 623A, On-the-Job Training Record-Continuation Sheet. Specific
   elements of the training should include, but are not limited to: (Note: AF IMT 623A is

worked, they will be loaded into AFRISS for refinement.
1.31. Prospecting—Lead Refinement. The following three priorities have been established.
Flight Chiefs are responsible to review, suspend and close leads. This may not be delegated.
   1.31.1. Priority 1. Priority 1 leads are those received through the recruiter-generated
   program, the national lead fulfillment system, prospective applicant Centers of Influence
   (COI), call-ins, school visits, career days, applicant generated leads and referrals from any
   other source. Students who have passed the high school ASVAB test and indicate ―military
   interested‖ are Priority 1 leads. Flight chiefs are authorized to assign any other lead into the
   Priority 1 category. Recruiters will attempt to contact all Priority 1 leads within 5 workdays
   of receipt.
   1.31.2. Priority 2:
       1.31.2.1. For EAs, Priority 2 leads consist of all qualified high school ASVAB test leads
       other than ―military interested.‖ Recruiters will contact these leads according to flight

       accredited college, university, or institution reflecting basic educational qualifications for
       any current commissioning program (residency list, college seniors, etc.). Recruiters will
       contact these leads according to flight chief instructions.
   1.31.3. Priority 3. Priority 3 leads consist of school, state license, or American Medical
   Association lists and all other leads not assigned to Priority 1 or 2. Recruiters will contact
   these leads according to flight chief instructions.

   1.32.1. EA, recruiters will establish next year‘s school program for all high schools,
   vocational schools, and 2-year junior/community colleges in their zone NLT the end of the
   current school year.
   1.32.2. For HP and LO, recruiters will establish a school program for all accredited colleges,
   universities, and/or institutions in their zone of responsibility. This includes assigned 4-year
   colleges and universities, nursing schools, and residency programs. Flight chiefs will
   establish suspense dates to update school programs.
1.33. Prospecting—School Visitation:
   1.33.1. Flight chiefs will help their recruiters assign priorities for each school (or institution)
   in their zone. Schools will be assigned one of three priorities based on productivity (actual or
   potential). Some of the factors to be considered when determining priorities are size,
   academic standing and diversity of the student population, accessibility, distance from the
   recruiting office, and number of schools assigned to an individual recruiter. Priority 1
   schools are the most productive schools and will be visited monthly. Priority 2 schools are
   fairly productive and will be visited every other month. Priority 3 schools are the least
   productive and will be visited once every four months. Exceptions to visitation requirements
   must be granted by the flight chief on a case-by-case basis and documented in the applicable
   school folder. If a school is deemed nonproductive, the flight chief will complete a
   memorandum for record (MFR), establishing what visitation schedule, if any, is expected.
   The flight chief will notify the production superintendent of the MFR and the production
   superintendent will annotate his/her concurrence.
   1.33.2. EA flight chiefs will periodically accompany their recruiters on school visits to
   ensure these visits are productive (generate leads, build relationships, promote the Air Force).
   They will visit schools that refuse to give the ASVAB (Air Force-responsible only), release
   lead lists, or allow recruiter visitations.
   1.33.3. HP and certified flight chiefs responsible for LO will establish criteria for school and
   institution priorities and visitation in their standards memorandum. The flight chief will visit
   Priority 1 and 2 schools and institutions that refuse to release lead lists or allow recruiter
   visitations in recruit viable programs only. Additionally, HP and certified flight chiefs
   responsible for LO will periodically accompany their recruiters on school and institution
   visits to ensure these visits are productive (generate leads, build relationships, promote the
   Air Force). Flight chiefs will document their actions in the school folder.
1.34. Production Evaluations (PE): (Note: When necessary, ensure the first sergeant assesses
any nonproduction detractors.)
   1.34.1. A PE is required when the operations flight identifies one of the following conditions
   or if the squadron commander or production superintendent directs a PE based on production
   deficiencies:
       1.34.1.1. A certified EA recruiter misses goal for three consecutive months or two
       consecutive quarters.
       1.34.1.2. A certified EA flight chief misses goal for three consecutive months or two
       consecutive quarters.

        1.34.2.1.1. Review office visit checklists, feedback, suspenses, expectations,
        flow/trend and AFRS Form 1484, Recruiter Daily Activity Log, feedback/direction
        levied on the deficient recruiter and provide guidance and feedback to the flight chief.
        1.34.2.1.2. Conduct an office visit on the deficient recruiter and document findings
        and corrective actions on the office visit suspense sheet.
        1.34.2.1.3. Designate another evaluator (other than the flight chief) to conduct an
        office visit. The evaluator must be a previously certified flight chief, and he or she
        will document his or her findings and corrective actions on the office visit suspense
        sheet.
        1.34.2.1.4. Request assistance from the group RST to conduct the evaluation. The
        group RST member will document his/her findings and corrective actions on the

        expectations, AFRS Form 1484 feedback (or electronic equivalent), etc. He or she
        will also review office visit checklists and feedback, review suspenses levied on
        deficient recruiters, and provide guidance and feedback to the flight chief.
        1.34.2.2.2. If the production superintendent deems it necessary, he or she will
        conduct office visits on deficient recruiters and document findings and corrective
        actions on an office visit suspense sheet.
        1.34.2.2.3. The production superintendent may designate another evaluator to
        conduct the office visits. The evaluator must be a previously certified flight chief, and
        he or she will document findings and corrective actions on the office visit suspense
        sheet.
        1.34.2.2.4. The production superintendent will request assistance from the group
        RST to conduct the evaluation when necessary. The group RST member will
        document findings and corrective actions on the office visit suspense sheet.
        1.34.2.2.5. If a flight misses three consecutive months, the PE may be waived with
        approval of the squadron commander. If a flight misses two consecutive quarters, the

 must have an approved DD Form 368, Request for Conditional Release, from HQ AFPC Enlisted
 Accessions, 550 C. Street West, Ste. 10, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4712, email
 ieb.message@randolph.af.mil. EA applicants who are not under and obligation and not ordered to
 active duty need only submit the completed DD Form 785, which will be included in the application.
 Disenrolled AFROTC cadets with or without a conditional released are processed/contracted as NPS
 applicants for Air Force purposes. Disenrolled Academy cadets with a conditional release to enlist in
 the RegAF do not attend basic military training and their time at the USAFA counts towards total
 active federal military service. These members do not hold an AFSC, therefore, they would only be
 eligible to enlist in a PS retraining quota or an AFPC Enlisted Accessions pre-arranged NPS direct to
 tech training quota.
 14. If the applicant is a traditional HSG with a high school diploma or an enrolled high school senior,
 the minimum age for enlistment is 17. Both parents must give their consent for 17-year old enlistees
 unless the parents are divorced or legally separated or one parent is deceased. In those situations, the
 divorce decree, separation agreement, or death certificate must be included in the application or
 hand-carried by the applicant to the MEPS. The consenting parent must be the custodial parent (or
 both, if joint custody). If the applicant has a court-appointed guardian, the guardian‘s consent is
 required and a copy of the court order must be included in the application or hand-carried by the
 applicant to the MEPS. If a court order, separation agreement, or death certificate is not available,
 the consenting adults must make a sworn affidavit in the presence of a notary public attesting to the
 fact of custody. This document must be included in the application or hand-carried to the MEPS.
 Parental consent is required on the DD Form 1966, Record of Military Processing - Armed Forces of
 the United States, before enlistment processing (Exception: aptitude testing). The form must be
 signed in the presence of an Air Force recruiting official or notarized. When signed by only one
 parent (because the other parent is absent for an extended period), a notarized statement from the
 parent signing the form will be attached, showing (1) the specific reason for the absence of the other
 parent, and (2) that the absent parent is aware of and consents to the enlistment. When one parent
 cannot be contacted (desertion of one party), the signing parent will provide a notarized statement,

giving the reason and period of other parent‘s absence. Parental or guardian consent is not required
for a married 17-year old applicant. Emancipated 17-year-olds may enlist with an approved parental
consent waiver from the squadron commander. Note: Title 10, U.S.C., Chapter 31, Section 505,
prohibits enlistment of anyone 42 or over. In unusual cases, an exception to policy (ETP) will be
sent via AFRISS to HQ USAF/A1P for an age exception if the applicant is between 27 and 42 years
of age. (DD Form 1966 is prescribed in DoDI 1304.2. Refer to that publication for guidance in
filling out that form.)
15. When reduced by TAFMS in a Regular component, the applicant‘s age must equal less than 28
years. However, if an applicant has previous satisfactory service in an ARC verified by AF Form
526, ANG/USAFR Point Credit Summary, their age must first equal less than 42 when reduced by
TAFMS in a Regular component. When his or her age is further reduced by years of satisfactory
service in the ARC, it must total less than 28 years. Do not use EAD service for ARC members to
make the first adjustment. See Attachment 2 for the age computation. (AF Form 526 is prescribed in
AFMAN 36-2622, Volume 1. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out this form.)
16. AFRS may allow a specified number of ASVAB test category IVA applicants (those with an
AFQT score between 21 and 30) to enlist in the Air Force. (No more than 1 percent of Air Force EA
operational standards may be more restrictive.) All ASVAB waivers, including category IVA and
other applicants with an AFQT score of 21 to 39, will be approved or disapproved by HQ
AFRS/RSO. Operational standards may vary on what percent of Air Force EAs should be a Tier 1.
17. Request an enlistment eligibility determination (EED) per procedures outlined in paragraph 3.19.
If applicant is currently on a control roster, no waivers are authorized. EA only: Prior Reg AF
members who separated with a qualifying RE do not require an EED for Article 15 punishment
received during the enlistment period indicated on their DD Form 214.
18. Exceptions may be granted for applicants who have (1) satisfactorily served in an ARC unit for
the two preceding (continuous) years, (2) possess a chronically critical AFSC, and (3) enlist for a
direct duty assignment (DDA).
19. Except reservists whose total active service consists of an initial tour of AD for training (ADT).
All others will require an eligibility determination by HQ AFRS/RSOP (for enlisted programs), HQ
AFRS/RSOC (for health professions) and HQ AFRS/RSOC (for BOT).
20. For a declination waiver, send a request to HQ AFRS/RSOC with the application. The request
should include the applicant‘s explanation of the circumstances leading to the declination.
21. No waivers are authorized. A person will not be considered as having committed a
―misdemeanor crime of domestic violence‖ for purposes of the firearms restriction recently added to
the Gun Control Act unless all of the following elements are present: (Note: Questions regarding
what constitutes a ―conviction of a domestic violence offense‖ should be addressed to HQ
AFRS/RSOPA.)

  right to counsel.
  21.5. If entitled to be tried by jury, the case was actually tried by a jury or the person knowingly and
  intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury.
  21.6. The conviction has not been expunged or set aside or the convicted offender has not been
  pardoned for the offense or had civil rights restored, unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration
  of civil rights provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.

1.39. Recruiter Assistance Program (RAP):
   1.39.1. The RAP is designed to allow Air Force members, primarily recent technical training
   school graduates, to work with recruiters and increase production by returning to their home
   towns and providing personal testimonials, assisting in obtaining school lists, participating in
   COI events and DEP commander‘s calls, and performing other non-administrative,
   recruiting-related tasks.
   1.39.2. Recruiters should brief new recruits and BOT candidates on the RAP during the
   EAD briefing and provide prospective participants with a partially completed AFRS IMT
   1327, Application for Participation in the Recruiter Assistance Program. Airmen and
   officers may apply to participate in the RAP while at technical school or BOT by submitting
   the AFRS Form 1327 to their military training manager or BOT personnel.
   1.39.3. While performing RAP duties, participants are in a ―non-chargeable leave‖ status.
   They receive no per diem or travel expenses. Up to 12 days of non-chargeable leave may be
   authorized. This will normally run from Monday of the first week to Friday of the following
   week (including one weekend). Authority for the use of non-chargeable leave is in AFI 36-
   3003, Military Leave Program, 11 Oct 2011.
   1.39.4. Specific RAP procedures are explained in the RAP Operations Handbook, located at
   http://www.rs.af.mil. Recruiting squadron commanders may terminate a member‘s
   participation and non-chargeable leave for nonperformance.

   http://www.afrotc.com/ for specific information.
2.2. Quality Applicants. Quality applicants are those who have collectively high attributes of
educational, aptitude, physical, and moral standards. Recruitment of these individuals is
essential to the effective operation of the Air Force. Meeting minimum enlistment qualifications
does not guarantee acceptance. Applicants are considered on a best-to-least qualified basis.
Commanders will ensure their recruiters adhere to the quality concept in meeting objectives.
2.3. Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, and Applicant Rights. All applicants must be given
a copy of AFRS Form 6, Air Force Applicants Rights, during the initial interview. Keep a copy
in the application and send the original to the MEPS. MEPS personnel will keep this in the case
file package. The original will be sent to Basic Military Training upon applicant entering active
duty and a copy will be kept in the residual file.
2.4. Education Accreditation:
   2.4.1. Unless otherwise indicated in this instruction, college and university course credits
   must have been earned from an institution listed in the Accredited Institutions of Post
   Secondary Education (AIPE) in the section for Accredited Degree Granting Institutions,
   using the edition for the last year attended. Contact HQ AFRS/RSOPA for information on
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                       43


   institutions listed in older editions. If the edition for the last year attended does not
   differentiate for degree-granting institutions, the institution must be degree-granting for
   credit to be awarded. Note: Applicants with course credits from an institution not listed in
   the AIPE may have their transcripts evaluated by an accredited degree-granting institution
   listed in the current AIPE directory.
   2.4.2. The evaluating school must show the number of quarter and semester hours an
   applicant will receive if he or she enrolled in that school. This information must come from
   the registrar and contain a raised or embossed seal. Two- and four-year college transcripts
   must be embossed with the school seal (raised or stamped). See the term ―educational
   credentials‖ in Attachment 1 for additional information.
2.5. Agreements. The Air Force reserves the right to deny entry onto AD to an applicant even
if an agreement was completed and the applicant has a projected EAD date. Additionally, the
Air Force may change an agreement before an applicant‘s entry onto AD. In these instances, the
applicant must be immediately notified of the change and left with a voluntary choice to accept
the change or decline to enter AD.
2.6. Basic Eligibility. Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements identified in this
instruction. Table 1.1 lists conditions that make applicants ineligible for enlistment or
commission. Question each applicant to determine whether they meet any of the conditions in
Table 1.1. An unqualified applicant will be tactfully dismissed. Applicants may be considered
for a waiver or ED, if he/she requests it.
2.7. Substantiation of Eligibility Requirements:
   2.7.1. The applicant has the burden of proof for eligibility requirements regarding age, name,
   citizenship, education, and dependency status. Substantiation must be in the form of original
   documents, notarized true copies, or certified true copies by the issuing agency. Recruiters
   and Air Force MEPS liaison NCOs (LNCO) will use these documents to verify eligibility
   and, when their purpose has been served, make every effort to return these personal
   documents to applicants and document these efforts in the applicant‘s record in AFRISS.
   2.7.2. An applicant with children who are under the age of 18 and incapable of self-care will
   be advised to take his or her original or notarized copy of the marriage certificate, original or
   notarized copies of each child‘s birth certificate, and each dependent‘s SSN to BMT, BOT,
   or COT so entitlements can be started as soon as possible.
2.8. Qualification Procedures—General. Before further processing continues, tentatively
qualify the applicant for the highest program available, based on his or her education level. Help
the applicant determine his or her potential for an AFROTC scholarship or USAFA appointment
as outlined on AF ROTC website http://afrotc.com. If the applicant appears to be eligible for
other commissioning programs, contact the HP recruiter or LO recruiter responsible for that
program. Discontinue EA processing until commissioning eligibility is resolved, unless the
applicant requests otherwise. Help the applicant determine his/her qualifications based on
current Air Force criteria. Document this transaction in the remarks section of AFRISS. Refer to
Chapter 6 for LO eligibility etc. Refer to Chapter 3 for specific Non-Prior Service (NPS)
processing procedures and Chapter 5 for PS processing procedures.
2.9. Mandatory SSN Documentation for EA HP and LO Applicants:
 44                                                             AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012

      2.9.1.3. Another official document or a letter on letterhead stationery issued by an office
      of the Social Security Administration, showing the applicant‘s name and SSN (process
      and DEP, but not EAD).
      2.9.1.4. Undeleted DD Form 214.
   2.9.2. If an applicant does not have any of the documents named in paragraphs 2.9.1.1
   through 2.9.1.4 to verify his or her SSN, he or she may use any two of the following
   documents containing his or her SSN (process and DEP, but not EAD):
      2.9.2.1. Driver‘s license.
      2.9.2.2. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (if two w-2
      forms are used they must be from different employers).
      2.9.2.3. Employment pay stub or statement (if two pay stubs are used they must be from
      different employers).
      2.9.2.4. Local, state, federal, or student ID.
      2.9.2.5. Official school transcript containing the SSN.
   2.9.3. Applicants may process for enlistment, but will not enter AD, without an SSN card.
   Married applicants who wish to enlist under a new name must possess a SSN card containing
   their new name. Use of other documents for accession must be approved in writing by the
   squadron commander or operations officer in AFRISS. Note: Like documents may be used
   from different sources; for example, two W-2 forms from different employers or two
   transcripts from different schools. However, this only applies if the USMEPCOM has
   verified the applicant‘s SSN.
   2.9.4. Applicants must be informed of the necessity to use and record their SSN and be
   asked specific questions about their background. Therefore, they must read a copy of the
   883, Privacy Act Statement - US Air Force Application Record, prior to completing
   enlistment paperwork. Annotate this in AFRISS. (AF IMT 883 is prescribed in AFI 36-2002.
   Refer to that publication for guidance on this IMT).
2.10. Medical Screening and Processing:
   2.10.1. Prescreening for medical disqualification requires the completion of DD Form 2807-
   2, Medical Prescreen of Medical History Report. This form will be completed, signed, and
   dated by the applicant and the recruiter prior to medical qualification processing. (DD Form
   2807-2 is prescribed in DoDD 6130.03, Physical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or
   Induction. Refer to USMEPCOM Regulation 40-1, Chapter 2, Medical Services, Medical

   medical documents (as needed) will be forwarded to the MEPS in sufficient time to allow for
   proper quality control (QC) procedures, but not later than the applicant‘s date for reporting to
   the MEPS for processing.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                     45


   2.10.2. Applicants must be physically qualified according to USMEPCOM Regulation 40-1,
   Medical Processing and Examinations, 1 Oct 2009, and DoDI 6130.03. However, certain

   standards. Inform applicants of this at the time they are being prepared for MEPS
   processing. Note: MEPS physicals are valid for 24 months from the date of the initial
   physical.
   2.10.3. Male applicants less than 60 inches or over 80 inches and female applicants less than
   58 inches or over 80 inches are ineligible for entry without a waiver from HQ AETC/SGPS.
   2.10.4. AFRS personnel are not authorized to perform body fat measurements (BFM) on
   applicants or allow recruiting personnel from other services to perform BFMs on Air Force
   applicants. An applicant who exceeds his or her maximum allowable weight (MAW)
   according to the Air Force body mass index (BMI) will have a BFM performed during
   physical processing at the MEPS and will be medically disqualified if he or she does not pass
   the BFM. In this case, the applicant is disqualified with a reevaluate justified (RJ) date. The
   applicant cannot go back to the MEPS to continue processing until the RJ date, and he or she
   either (1) lose the equivalent of 4 pounds per each percent of body fat over the allowable
   BFM for his or her age, sex, and height, at the rate of 1 pound per 4 days, or (2) falls below
   his or her MAW. Refer to Attachment 3 for specific BFM.
2.11. Drug and Alcohol Screening and Processing. Applicants must read and understand the
Air Force Drug and Alcohol Policy printed on AF IMT 2030, USAF Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Certificate. This IMT must be completed, signed, and dated by the applicant and the recruiter
prior to aptitude or medical qualification processing. If an applicant refuses to sign the AF IMT
2030, terminate the interview and tactfully dismiss the applicant. Refer to paragraphs 3.21 and
3.22. Applicants who sign the AF IMT 2030 will be considered in applicant status until it is
established that either AFRS or the individual have withdrawn applicant status. (AF IMT 2030
is prescribed in AFI 36-2002. Refer to that publication for further guidance on filling out this
IMT.)
2.12. Education Records Requirements:
   2.12.1. A traditional high school diploma from a secondary school day program obtained in
   residence and located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, US territorial
   possessions, or oversea DoD-operated schools is required to substantiate high school
   graduation. The following documents may also be used to validate traditional high school
   graduation: a notarized or certified true copy of the diploma by the issuing agency, an
   undeleted DD Form 214, or a letter on high school letterhead stationary certifying the
   graduation and the date of graduation and signed by the principal, vice principal, guidance
   counselor, or registrar. A single letter signed by the principal, vice principal, registrar, or
   guidance counselor, listing all applicants may be used in place of individual diplomas. Note:
   High school transcripts alone are not acceptable as proof of graduation. This is because
   many schools show a graduation date on a transcript, but never issue a diploma because the
   student failed the mandatory state testing requirements required for graduation in that state.
   2.12.2. Use official college transcripts from an accredited degree-granting institution for
   non-HSGs who qualify as Education Code 8 or higher (15 accredited semester hours or 22
   quarter hours [or more]). If an applicant has a GED certificate, he or she must present an
   original or notarized true copy of the state-sanctioned GED certificate, a GED test result
46                                                           AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


  form letter stating he or she qualified for a GED, or a letter of intent to issue a GED
  certificate.
  2.12.3. Applicants educated in other than US educational institutions must have an
  educational-level evaluation before enlistment to qualify as a HSG or higher. Such
  evaluations may be obtained through a state‘s department of education, a college or
  university listed in the current AIPE directory, or an authorized credentials evaluation
  agency. The evaluation must specify the applicant‘s educational level (HSG or higher).
  Applicants are responsible for any fees incurred. (The credentials evaluation agency must be
  a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services found at
  http://www.naces.org under ―current members.‖
  2.12.4. Most DoD schools keep records for 4 years. If applicant‘s records are no longer
  available at that location, a copy may be obtained by visiting the DoD Education Activity
  Student Records website http://www.dodea.edu/students/transcripts.cfm
  2.12.5. The educational credentials (categories and definitions) listed below will be used for
  processing purposes:
     2.12.5.1. High School Graduate (HSG) or Higher (Tier 1). An applicant who
     completed a 12-year ―traditional‖ graded (credit-based) day program of classroom
     instruction; the diploma must be issued from the high school where the individual
     completed the requirements for graduation. Applicants who are not formal HSGs, but
     have proof (an official transcript) of 15 or more semester hours (22 quarter hours or 675
     clock hours) of classroom instruction from a regionally accredited, degree-granting
     college or university listed in the edition of the Accredited Institutions of Post Secondary
     Education for the last year attended, are considered to be HSGs or higher for enlistment
     purposes and coding. Do not count credits for courses failed, withdrawn, or withdrawn
     while passing or failing. If a course is repeated and passed, credit can be counted only
     once. Preparatory or remedial courses may be used if the school counts them in total
     hours credited toward degree requirements. An applicant who earned a diploma on the
     basis of attending and completing an adult education diploma program is considered a
     HSG, education code B.
     2.12.5.2. Alternate High School Credential Holder (Tier 2):
         2.12.5.2.1. An applicant who possesses a GED or other test-based high school
         equivalency certificate or diploma, which includes the California High School
         Proficiency Examination (CHSPE). Note: A person who subsequently obtains a
         local or state-issued diploma solely on the basis of such equivalency testing is not
         considered an HSG.
         2.12.5.2.2. An applicant who obtains a high school diploma or certificate of
         completion for a course of study undertaken in a non-resident or non-attendance-
         based status, including a correspondence, home school, or distance education.
         2.12.5.2.3. An applicant who possesses an attendance-based certificate or diploma
         (certificate of competency or completion) from other than a traditional high school,
         which is issued on course completion as opposed to equivalency testing.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                     47


        2.12.5.2.4. An applicant who has completed at least 11 years of regular day school
        and attended, in residence, a vocational (technical) or proprietary school for at least 6
        months and possesses a certificate of attendance or completion indicating such. (This
        does not include correspondence courses offering vocational certificates.)
     2.12.5.3. Non-HSG (Tier 3). An applicant who holds none of the credentials in Tiers 1
     or 2. Note: This tier includes those who do not complete a high school exit exam.
     2.12.5.4. Associate’s Degree. A certificate conferred on completion of a 2-year program
     at a junior college, university, or technical institute (listed in the AIPE for the last year
     attended).
     2.12.5.5. Completion of College Credits. An individual who is a non-high school
     credential holder, who has successfully completed at least 15 semester hours or 22
     quarter hours of college-level credit from a regionally accredited, degree-granting college
     or university. Credit earned through testing for pursuit of adult education or for high
     school equivalency preparation is not applicable. For military enlistment processing
     purposes, an individual with this status is considered an HSG (Tier 1).
     2.12.5.6. Correspondence School Diploma. A secondary school diploma or certificate
     awarded upon completion of correspondence school course work, regardless of whether
     the diploma was issued by a correspondence school, a state, or a secondary or
     postsecondary educational institution. This also includes home schools. This is
     considered an alternate high school credential holder (Tier 2).
     2.12.5.7. High School Certificate of Attendance. An attendance-based high school
     certificate or diploma. These are sometimes called certificates of competency or
     completion, but are based on course completion rather than a test such as the GED or
     CHSPE. (A state or locally issued secondary school diploma obtained solely on the basis
     of an attendance credential is not considered a high school diploma.) This is considered
     an alternate high school credential holder (Tier 2).
     2.12.5.8. High School Diploma. A diploma issued to an individual who has attended
     and completed a traditional 12-year (or grade) day program of classroom instruction. The
     diploma must be issued from the school where the individual completed all the program
     requirements. An individual who will complete high school graduation requirements
     early (midterm graduates) must present a signed letter on high school stationery from a
     school official (principal, vice principal, counselor, or registrar) stating the date the
     individual will complete all graduation requirements and will be available to enter AD.
     This letter must be presented to the MLS before a job is reserved, for an AD date prior to
     the applicant‘s formal high school graduation date.
     2.12.5.9. High School Senior. The status of an individual who is currently attending a
     traditional, attendance-based high school (or has completed the junior year and is
     scheduled to attend the senior year) and will graduate at the end of the current school
     year. High school seniors are considered HSGs for processing purposes, but graduation
     must be confirmed prior to AD enlistment. For enlistment eligibility purposes, a non-
     HSGs (Tier 3) or alternate credential holder (Tier 2) who is currently enrolled in a
     regionally accredited, degree-granting college or university listed in the current education
 48                                                          AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


      directory may be processed for DEP enlistment in the same manner as a high school
      senior if he or she:
          2.12.5.9.1. Is currently enrolled in the school.
          2.12.5.9.2. Has provided evidence from that college or university that he or she will
          have at least 15 semester hours or 22-quarter hours of credit by a specified date.
          2.12.5.9.3. Has provided an official transcript prior to EAD. Note: Applicants may
          not be rebooked for failing to complete college credits by the date first specified. If
          this happens, they must be canceled and rebooked after attaining the required college
          credits.
      2.12.5.10. Home Study Diploma. A secondary school diploma or certificate typically
      awarded based on certification by a parent or guardian that an individual has completed
      his or her secondary education at home. (This includes correspondence schools.) This
      diploma is considered an alternate credential (Tier 2).
      2.12.5.11. Occupational Program Certificate. A certificate or diploma awarded for
      attending a non-correspondence vocational (technical) or proprietary school for at least 6
      months. An individual so coded must also have completed 11 years of regular day school.
      This is considered an alternate high school credential (Tier 2).
      2.12.5.12. Test-Based Equivalency. A diploma or certificate of GED or other test-
      based high school equivalency diploma. This includes state-wide testing programs, such
      as the CHSPE, whereby examinees may earn a certificate of competency or proficiency.
      (A state or locally issued secondary school diploma obtained solely on the basis of such
      equivalency testing is not to be considered a high school diploma. This is considered an
      alternate high school credential [Tier 2].)
   2.12.6. Refer to Chapter 3 for LO educational requirements, especially if applicant is a dual
   EA/LO applicant.
2.13. Guaranteed Training Enlistment Program (GTEP) AFSC Requirements:
   2.13.1. Some GTEP AFSCs require a valid driver‘s license as a prerequisite for
   classification into that AFSC. When an applicant selects one of those AFSCs, ensure his or
   her license is valid for 6 months after EAD. (Exception: If the applicant is from a state that
   has an automatic extension for AD personnel, the license must be valid on the EAD date and
   in the applicant‘s possession during BMT.) A valid license must be issued by one of the 50
   states, the District of Columbia, the US Army Europe, or a territorial possession of the US.
   Licenses that are under suspension or revocation, contain restrictions that limit hours or
   situations, or are temporary as of the AD date are not valid. Note: See manual QC PGM for
   additional guidance.
   2.13.2. Aptitude Index (AI) enlistees are encouraged to have a valid driver‘s license (valid
   for 6 months after EAD) in their possession to be eligible for classification into skills
   requiring a driver‘s license. (Exception: The applicant is from a state that has an automatic
   extension.)        For     specific   driver‘s  license    information     by state,     see
   http://www.driversmanuals.com/.
2.14. Dependent Care Responsibilities:
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                      49


   2.14.1. All applicants, single or married, must be thoroughly counseled and complete an AF
   IMT 3010, USAF Statement of Understanding for Dependent Care Responsibility. The IMT
   will be completed, signed, and dated by the applicant (sponsor) and the recruiter prior to
   aptitude or medical qualification processing. The intent is to make sure adequate family care
   arrangements have been made while the sponsor is undergoing training and transition to
   military life. This is normally considered to include BMT or OTS (BOT and COT), technical
   training, and a period of sufficient duration at the initial base of assignment to adjust to the
   locale and make suitable family care arrangements. Note: The name, relationship, and date
   of birth of each family member (including spouse) or ―NA‖ will be included in the remarks
   section of AF IMT 3010. (AF IMT 3010 is prescribed in AFI 36-2002. Refer to that
   publication for further guidance on this IMT.)
   2.14.2. To enroll family members in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System
   (DEERS), the applicant will need to take his or her spouse‘s SSN, a notarized or original
   copy of the marriage certificate, and notarized or original copies of all children‘s birth
   certificates and SSNs. The family will then receive a basic allowance for housing (BAH).
2.15. Disqualification Because of Family Members:
   2.15.1. An unmarried applicant who has physical or legal custody of a family member
   incapable of self-care is classified as a single-member sponsor by the Air Force. Because of
   this sponsor responsibility, the applicant does not have the flexibility required to perform
   worldwide duty, short-notice TDY, remote tours, and varied duty hours. Therefore, an
   applicant falling into this category is ineligible for enlistment unless permanent physical and
   legal custody has been transferred by court order. Note: When permanent physical and legal
   custody has been transferred by court order, a waiver may be requested. (See paragraph
   3.23.)
   2.15.2. For the same reason as shown in paragraph 2.15.1, an applicant who is married to a
   military member and has physical or legal custody of family members incapable of self-care
   is also ineligible unless custody has been transferred by court order.
   2.15.3. Never counsel such applicants to intentionally change their marital or custodial status
   for the purpose of enlistment qualification. (See paragraph 3.23).
2.16. Disqualification Because of Moral Factors:
   2.16.1. Use paragraphs 3.10 through 3.14 to screen applicants for potentially disqualifying
   moral factors. Inform applicants of the importance of revealing all law violations, regardless
   of their disposition. Ensure the applicant understands that even if the incident occurred while
   they were a minor and they were told by law or judicial authorities that dropped, dismissed
   charges, or expunged records do not have to be reported to anyone, all offenses will be
   revealed during an in-depth background check.
   2.16.2. Inform applicants that other agencies will also conduct a security investigation. They
   will match information provided by the applicant with local, state, and Federal Bureau of
   Investigation (FBI) records. Any disparity in this information could result in job cancellation
   or discharge if the applicant is on AD. Accuracy and honesty are paramount. Findings of not
   guilty, sealed record, Nolle Prosequi, stet processus, adjournment in contemplation of
   dismissal (ACOD), delayed prosecution, continued without a finding, and youth offender
   must also be disclosed.
 50                                                            AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


2.17. Disqualification Because of Financial Factors. Use paragraphs 3.25 and 3.26 to screen
applicants for potentially disqualifying financial factors.
2.18. Verification of Age, Citizenship, and Name—General. All documents must be original,
notarized true copies of the source document or certified true copies by the issuing agency. The
burden of proof for establishing US citizenship rests with the applicant. For more specific
information, see requirements for US citizens (paragraph 2.19), non-US citizens (paragraph
2.20), and dual citizens (paragraph 2.21).
2.19. Requirements for US Citizens:
   2.19.1. A birth certificate obtained from the applicable state vital statistics office may be
   used for age, citizenship, and name verification. A DD Form 372, Request for Verification of
   Birth, validated by a local, county, or state vital statistics office may also be used when a
   valid birth certificate cannot be obtained. (Note: Hospital-generated birth certificates are not
   authorized). See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm for a list of vital statistics offices by
   state. (DD Form 372 is prescribed in DoDI 1304.2. Refer to that publication for guidance on
   filling out the form.)
   2.19.2. Recruiters may ask squadron operations to perform a telephonic verification to
   authorize MEPS processing for job reservation and DEP enlistment. However, a DD Form
   372 signed by the operations NCO who is verifying the information must be received by the
   MEPS before the applicant processes. Additionally, a completed DD Form 372 from a vital
   statistics office or other valid source document establishing proof of name, age, and
   citizenship must be received before AD enlistment. An undeleted DD Form 214 may be used
   for SSN, name, and age verification only. Additional source documents (such as a current,
   valid, unrestricted and US passport showing the holder as a US citizen; another official
   document issued by a vital statistics office; or a court order for a name change only) may be
   used.
   2.19.3. Canadian-born Native Americans are exempt from having to apply for or carry an
   INS Form I-551, Alien Registration Receipt Card, but they are considered aliens for
   assignment and classification purposes. Type in the Remarks section of the DD Form 1966
   and have the applicant initial, "I am an American Indian born in Canada as defined in
   Immigration and Naturalization Service Regulation 8 CFR 289.1") A letter or other
   document from the tribal chief, council, or other reservation official will be used to verify the
   Canadian-born Native American‘s name, age, and place of birth. AFRS personnel will not
   enter Canada to actively prospect or recruit Canadian-born Native Americans.
   2.19.4. An applicant born in Panama must have a government-issued birth certificate with a
   raised seal, and one parent must be a US citizen.
   2.19.5. An individual born abroad who acquired US citizenship at birth may use any of the
   following documents, issued by the specified agency, for verification:
       2.19.5.1. From the Department of State (DS):
           2.19.5.1.1. A valid US passport (5 years for minors, 10 years for adults).
           2.19.5.1.2. FS Form 240, Consular Report of Birth, or FS Form 545, Certification of
           Birth.
           2.19.5.1.3. DS Form 1350, Certificate of Report of Birth.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                    51


      2.19.5.2. From the US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS):
          2.19.5.2.1. INS Form N-560A, Certificate of Citizenship.
          2.19.5.2.2. INS Form N-561, Certificate of Citizenship (replacement for INS Form
          N-560A).
   2.19.6. An individual born abroad who derived US citizenship through the naturalization of
   his or her parents may use any of the following documents, issued by the specified agency,
   for verification:
      2.19.6.1. From the DS, valid US passport (5 years for minors, 10 years for adults).
      2.19.6.2. From the INS:
          2.19.6.2.1. INS Form N-560A.
          2.19.6.2.2. INS Form N-561 (replacement for INS Form N-560A).
   2.19.7. An individual born abroad who acquired US citizenship through his or her own
   naturalization may use any of the following documents, issued by the specified agency, for
   verification:
      2.19.7.1. From the DS, a valid US passport (5 years for minors, 10 years for adults).
      2.19.7.2. From the INS:
          2.19.7.2.1. INS Form N-550, Certificate of Naturalization.
          2.19.7.2.2. INS Form N-570, Certificate of Naturalization (replacement for INS
          Form N-550).
   2.19.8. Normally, US citizens will be enlisted under the name that appears on their birth
   verification document. However, they may enlist with a preferred first, middle, and or
   surname. Those electing to do so must present their SSN card, showing their preferred name,
   to their recruiter for proper application preparation and completion of the Standard Form
   (SF) 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions. The preferred name should reflect
   the name the applicant is known by in the community (Refer to DD Form 1966). Final
   acceptance of the preferred enlistment name rests with the MEPS liaison supervisor (MLS).
   For applicants approved to enlist without a SSN card, ensure their preferred name is shown
   on the documents used in place of the SSN card.
2.20. Requirements for Non-US Citizens: (Note: This information applies to EA programs
only; all commissioning program applicants must be US citizens.)
   2.20.1. Non-US citizens will not enter AD without their INS Form I-551 status in their
   possession, solely indicating permanent resident status. Applicants may process with (1) an
   INS Form I-551 with an expiration date greater than two years from date of issue (a
   ―permanent‖ card); (2) an INS Form I-551 without expiration date and an INS Form G-845,
   Document Verification Request, with no restrictions; or (3) an INS Form G-845 with no
   restrictions, proof that a ―permanent‖ card was ordered, and proof of permanent alien status
   (that is, a stamped passport; an INS Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record; or an old INS
   Form I-551with temporary stamp).
52                                                          AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


  2.20.2. Under unusual circumstances, HQ AFRS/RSO may approve an INS Form I-551
  exception to policy (ETP) in AFRISS on an applicant for EAD who has ordered, but not
  received, an INS Form I-551. Note: Applicants who do not have a permanent INS Form I-
  551 at the time of MEPS processing will be reserved to EAD no earlier than eight months
  from the date the permanent card was ordered. There is no exception to the 8-month rule.
  2.20.3. Applicants who had a permanent INS Form I-551 at the time of processing and
  reordered the card, but did not receive it prior to EAD (15 duty days), must have a written
  approval from the squadron commander in AFRISS. The request must include the following
  documents:
     2.20.3.1. A copy of a current (less than 30 days old) INS Form G-845 with no
     restrictions or conditions
     2.20.3.2. A copy of the applicant‘s SSN card. The card may not have any type of stamp;
     for example, ―Authorized For Work Only.‖
     2.20.3.3. An applicant data or QC report showing applicant information and EAD.
  2.20.4. Applicants who did not have a permanent INS Form I-551 at the time of processing
  and did not receive their permanent INS Form I-551 card prior to EAD (15 duty days) must
  request an ETP from HQ AFRS/RSO. The ETP request package must include the following
  documents:
     2.20.4.1. A copy of a current (less than 30 days old) INS Form G-845 with no
     restrictions or conditions.
     2.20.4.2. A copy of the applicant‘s SSN card. (The card may not have any type of stamp;
     for example, ―Authorized For Work Only.‖)
     2.20.4.3. Proof of permanent resident alien status; for example, a stamped passport (with
     no conditions or restrictions), an INS Form I-94, or an old INS Form I-551 with a
     temporary stamp.
     2.20.4.4. An applicant data or QC report showing applicant information and EAD.
  2.20.5. An ETP is an ―exception‖ and may be approved or disapproved. However, because it
  is not an automatic approval process, applicants should be informed of this before submitting
  the ETP. It is in their best interest to have all appropriate documents well ahead of EAD.
  2.20.6. The INS Form I-551s have a 10-year expiration date on it (from the date of issue).
  Applicants who have expiration dates on their INS Form I-551s for two years or less from
  date of issue, or have conditions placed on their residency are ineligible for processing or
  enlistment.
  2.20.7. Citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of Marshall
  Islands/Palau must have an INS Form I-94, stamped CFA-RMI, CFA-FSM, or CFA-PAC,
  and one of the following to confirm citizenship:
     2.20.7.1. Birth certificate.
     2.20.7.2. Passport.
     2.20.7.3. US Naturalization Certificate.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                      53


        2.20.7.4. US Certificate of Citizenship.
     2.20.8. The non-US citizen‘s name entered on military records must match the name
     recorded with the INS. Without exception, non-US citizens must enlist with the name that
     appears on their INS Form I-551. This form is limited to 27 characters. If an applicant‘s
     name exceeds 27 characters, use the applicant‘s entire name starting with the 27 characters
     on the INS Form I551.
     2.20.9. To verify place of birth, use either the applicant‘s birth certificate or his or her
     current US passport.
2.21. Requirements for Dual Citizens:
     2.21.1. For enlistment purposes, the US does not recognize dual citizenship. Individuals
     who claim dual citizenship must renounce their citizenship to another country and relinquish
     any foreign passports to qualify for enlistment.
     2.21.2. Applicants wishing to terminate dual citizenship status must write a statement
     renouncing their citizenship to another country and mail (using registered or certified mail)
     any foreign passports to the respective embassies and provide the postage receipt to MEPS or
     destroy (in the presence of MLS) prior to processing.
2.22. Enlistment Grade Determination. Use Table 2.1 to determine the enlistment grade of
an applicant based on prior qualifications or education. Use Attachment 2, Table A2.1, to
determine the enlistment grade of PS applicants. Go to paragraph 6.8.2. and Attachment 2 for LO
rank determinations.

NOTES:
1. Documents presented after completion of BMT may not be used as a basis for changing the
authorized enlistment grade except through application forwarded by the member‘s MPS to HQ AFPC
Enlisted Accessions with statement of justification and supporting documents.
2. Applicants electing 6-year enlistment options will enlist in the grade of AB (unless authorized
higher grade) and will be promoted as documented on their AF Form 3008, Supplement to Enlistment
Agreement-United States Air Force.
3. Locally produced and authenticated copies of substantiating documents must be included in the
enlistee‘s application sent to the 737th TRSS, Lackland AFB TX 78236-5255.
4. TAFMS of over 90 days or 12 months must be verified. Use DD Form 214 or 215, AF IMT 1613,
Statement of Service (or another service equivalent); NGB Form 22, Report of Separation and Record
of Service; and AF Form 526, ANG/USAFR Point Credit Summary. SURF verification through
MilPDS may be used to validate TAFMS, ASVAB scores, EPR ratings, and awarded AFSCs and pay
grade for Res-Res applicants or those serving in ANG and AFRC.
5. If the grade of Airman or higher is not indicated on the DD Form 214, use the pay grade of E-2 on
the DD Form 368 (with expiration date); promotion orders, if dated after the DD Form 368; or AF
Form 526.
6. To verify service, obtain DD Form 785 from the appropriate service academy. (See Attachment 4.)
7. Use the following as a guide for determining the value of credits:
7.1. One (1) quarter hour = 2/3 of 1 semester hour.
7.2. One (1) semester hour = 1 1/2 quarter hours.
7.3. One (1) trimester hour = 1 semester hour.
7.4. Fifteen (15) clock or contact hours = 1 semester hour. Note: Use this computation unless an
accredited, degree-granting institution (published in the AIPE directory) that uses semester hours
evaluates and indicates the number of semester hours.
8. Do not count credits for courses failed, withdrawn, withdrawn while passing of failing, or
incomplete. Preparatory or remedial courses may be used if the school counts them in the total hours
credited toward degree requirements.
9. Colleges and universities not listed (or listed as ―candidate‖ institutions) in the AIPE directory are
not authorized for award of a higher education code or enlistment grade.
10. When the AIPE directory reflects courses of varying lengths and the transcript does not specify
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                        55


 the type of credit hours, a letter from the school stating the type of credits earned must be attached to
 the transcripts and a copy retained in the MEPS residual file.
 11. Verify ―stripes‖ for education eligibility by use of the following documentation:
 11.1. An original transcript (not a student or photo copy)from an educational institution listed in the
 edition of the AIPE directory for the last year attended. The transcript must be presented before
 entering AD and will include the applicant‘s application going to the 737th TRSS. (Locally
 reproduced copies will be kept in the MEPS residual file.)
 11.2. If the applicant‘s school is not regionally accredited, a letter of acceptance from a school listed
 in the current AIPE directory is acceptable. The letter, with transcript attached, must:
 11.2.1. State that the applicant would be accepted for continuing education.
 11.2.2. State the total transferable credits by semester or quarter hours.
 11.2.3. Bear the school‘s seal and original signature of the registrar or his or her representative.
 11.3. If the applicant was educated in a school not in the US education system, a letter of evaluation
 from an accredited credentials evaluation agency with transcripts attached or an evaluation of the
 foreign college transcripts by an accredited degree-granting institution listed in the current AIPE
 directory, specifying the semester and/or quarter hours earned or would be awarded if enrolled in that
 school, is acceptable. The MLS may then give the applicant the advanced pay grade.
2.23. Verification of PS. Verify PS with the DMDC. The DMDC maintains prior regular
enlistment and officer losses as well as reserve component losses. It does not maintain data on
AFROTC or service academy cadets. If member disputes Air Force Component information
recorded in the DMDC report, and has significant proof the information is incorrect, contact
AFPC Enlisted Accessions at (210) 565-3569 or DSN 665-2039 or email
ieb.message@randolph.af.mil. Refer to Chapter 5 to determine required documentation and to
verify PS.
2.24. ASVAB, AFOQT, and Special Purpose Testing—General. The following describes
testing and retesting policies and procedures for ASVAB and special purpose tests: (Note: Refer
to USMEPCOM testing directives for more specific guidance.)
   2.24.1. Test Compromise. Report known compromises to your supervisor or TCO
   immediately. Test compromise is the unauthorized discussion, disclosure, or wrongful
   possession of a controlled item (test material), which includes the intentional changing of test
   scores by test scoring personnel or intentionally entering false test scores on official records,
   including AFRISS.
   2.24.2. Testing Practices. Recruiting personnel will:
       2.24.2.1. Fully understand and adhere to the AFRS testing policy prescribed in this
       instruction and make full use of the ASVAB information booklet provided by
       USMEPCOM.
       2.24.2.2. Not place themselves in a test-compromising situation.
       2.24.2.3. Not sign USMEPCOM Form 680-3A-E, Request for Examination, on behalf of
       applicants processing for other Armed Forces or allow other Armed Forces recruiters to
       sign on behalf of Air Force applicants.
       2.24.2.4. Not refer applicants to reserve or guard recruiters for the purpose of testing or
       test applicants for another Armed Forces recruiter.
 56                                                          AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


      2.24.2.5. Not speculate on the reason for test failure with applicants. Applicants desiring
      this information must contact the MEPS TCO.
      2.24.2.6. Administer the AFOQT IAW AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel
      Testing System, 17 Feb 2009, Attachment 2.
   2.24.2.7. Accommodate AFPC Enlisted Accessions in conducting required ASVAB testing
   for disenrolled AFROTC cadets involuntarily ordered to active duty to fulfill their service
   obligation. Recruiters do not prequalify these members or schedule any processing other
   than what is required for ASVAB testing. Once member has been provided a copy of their
   scores, the recruiter may close the PIR. No further actions are necessary. Questions of
   concerns can be answered by contacting AFPC Enlisted Accessions at (210) 565-2039 or
   DSN 665-2039 or email ieb.message@randolph.af.mil
2.25. Enlistment Screening Test (EST) and Computer Adaptive Screening Test (CAST):
   2.25.1. Before recruiters administer the EST or CAST, they must be familiar with all the
   provisions of Air Force Personnel Test (AFPT) 903, Administrative Scoring Manual for the
   Enlistment Screening Test, and the information in this directive pertaining to the EST and
   CAST. Recruiters will give and score the EST in accordance with AFPT 903 and this
   instruction and annotate the results in AFRISS. The CAST automatically scores results.
   2.25.2. The EST and CAST are not qualification tests; they are strictly recruiting tools. They
   are not controlled tests materials, but are still controlled as for official use only (FOUO)
   material. These tests are management screening tools that may be administered at the
   discretion of the recruiter to NPS Air Force applicants only. They are used to help estimate
   an applicant‘s probability of obtaining qualifying ASVAB scores. Below-standard EST or
   CAST scores may be used to deter an applicant from taking the ASVAB. However,
   tentatively qualified applicants have the right to take the ASVAB, regardless of their EST or
   CAST results.
   2.25.3. The EST and CAST contain questions similar to, but not identical with, questions
   appearing on the ASVAB. EST or CAST raw scores are a composite index of performance in
   verbal and numerical reasoning areas. These tests require approximately 30 to 45 minutes to
   complete, depending on the test used.
   2.25.4. Do not retest with the EST or CAST within 30 days after the last administration of
   either form of the test. When retesting, give the applicant the alternative form of the test.
   Only three retests are authorized within a 12-month period.
   2.25.5. Tests and answer sheets are not releasable to anyone other than authorized recruiting
   personnel. These records are exempt from release under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
   Ensure all requests for this information are processed through HQ AFRS/RSI.
   2.25.6. During normal duty hours, place FOUO material in an out-of-sight location. During
   non-duty hours, store FOUO material to prevent unauthorized access. When normal, internal
   building security is provided during non-duty hours, file the tests and answer sheets with
   other unclassified documents in unlocked files or desks, etc. When there is no such internal
   security, locked buildings or rooms usually provide adequate after-hours protection. If you
   desire additional protection, store FOUO material in locked containers, such as file cabinets,
   desks, or bookcases.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                       57


2.26. Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB):
   2.26.1. The ASVAB evaluates specific aptitude areas (AA) and gives percentile scores that
   are used for selecting and classifying individuals for the Armed Forces. There are two
   ASVAB testing programs—production testing and high school (institutional) testing.
      2.26.1.1. Production testing involves testing in authorized testing facilities such as MEPS
      and mobile examining team sites. The test results are given directly to AFRS and are for
      its use only.
      2.26.1.2. High school testing is offered on a voluntary, no-cost basis to educational
      institutions (high schools and vocational trade schools). Testing results are provided to
      the school, student, and AFRS. Although test scores may be used for enlistment purposes,
      DoD advertises the student version primarily as a vocational counseling tool. Guidance
      concerning the high school testing program is in AFI 36-2016, Armed Services Military
      Personnel Accession Testing Programs. Squadron commanders should work within the
      IRC to delete those schools that discriminate based on race, creed, color, national origin,
      or sex from the school eligibility roster.
   2.26.2. For Air Force requirements, selected ASVAB subtests yield four broad aptitude
   scores: mechanical, administrative, general, and electronic. In addition, the ASVAB provides
   an overall quality indicator, the AFQT percentile score. AFQT categories are as follows:
   Category 1 = 93 to 99, Category 2 = 65 to 92, Category 3A = 50 to 64, Category 3B = 31 to
   49, Category 4A = 21 to 30, Category 4B = 16 to 20, Category 4C = 10 to 15, and Category 5
   = 0 to 9. AFECD, Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, prescribes the minimum
   scores required for entry into AFSCs. See Table 1.1, Line 40, of this instruction for further
   information.
   2.26.3. All NPS and PS applicants must have qualifying AFQT test scores. All test IDs must
   be verified and tests ―re-normed‖ if required. If a test version cannot be verified, the
   applicant must retest. NPS and PS applicants must also meet AF ASVAB qualifying score
   requirements currently in effect.
   2.26.4. ASVAB scores are valid for 2 years from the date of the test to the date of the
   commitment. (Individuals not in the DEP and with test scores over 2 years old must be
   retested.) In all cases, a valid retest invalidates previous test results. Use the most recent,
   valid ASVAB result for enlistment or reservation.
   2.26.5. Parental or guardian consent is not required solely for ASVAB testing of an applicant
   less than 18 years of age. However, an applicant 16 years of age may not be administered a
   production version of the ASVAB regardless of high school senior status.
   2.26.6. Verification screening is performed on all ASVAB tests administered by the MEPS.
   This screening process identifies any irregular scoring patterns and may result in an applicant
   having to take a confirmation test. If a retest accomplished within 6 months has a 20 or more
   percentile point increase in the AFQT portion of the test, a confirmation test is required. The
   LNCO must notify the applicant‘s recruiter that a confirmation test is required and that no
   further processing is authorized until the confirmation retest is completed or until 6 months
   have elapsed from the date of the applicant‘s retest. At that time, the applicant may
   voluntarily retest or use his or her current score of record. (Normally, this will be the initial
   ASVAB taken.) Confirmation retests will be administered only at the MEPS.
 58                                                              AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


        2.26.6.1. If the applicant‘s confirmation test AFQT percentile score is 36 or above, the
        MEPS will validate the applicant‘s retest score (not the confirmation test score) for
        enlistment. If the applicant fails to show up for a confirmation test, his or her initial test
        score will be validated and retesting is not authorized until 6 months have elapsed from
        the retest date.
        2.26.6.2. If the applicant‘s confirmation test AFQT percentile score is less than 35 or
        differs by 20 points or greater, a confirmation interview is required. If the applicant
        passes the confirmation test interview, the MEPS will validate the applicant‘s retest score
        (not the confirmation test score) for enlistment. If the applicant fails the confirmation test
        interview, his or her initial test score remains valid and he or she will be prohibited from
        further retesting until 6 months have elapsed from the date of the confirmation test. If,
        under these same circumstances (a confirmation test score of 35 or below), the applicant
        fails to show for a confirmation test interview, his or her initial test will be valid and
        retesting is not authorized until 6 months have elapsed from the confirmation test date.
        2.26.6.3. Under no circumstances will the confirmation test score be used for enlistment
        purposes. Contact the Air Force liaison at the MEPS for the current confirmation test
        policy.
     2.26.7. Retesting applicants while in the delayed entry program (DEP) is not authorized.
     However, applicants who do not current hold a job reservation may be voluntarily DEP
     discharged for the purpose of improving aptitude scores when current scores limit the ability
     to be matched to an Air Force skill.
        2.26.7.1. If in the DEP, applicants must voluntarily elect to be discharged from the DEP
        for the purposes of seeking a higher AFQT, or better individual MAGE score(s). Ensure
        the applicant is eligible for retest. There is a mandatory 6-month wait for retesting when
        the previous test is invalidated. There will be no exceptions to policy for invalid retests
        when errors are made in calculating the applicant‘s eligibility for a retest.
        2.26.7.2. Before any retest is administered, or the applicant is DEP discharged, the flight
        chief must interview the individual and give approval for the retest. The flight chief must
        document this interview in AFRISS.
        2.26.7.3. Applicants must be briefed prior to retesting that all previous ASVAB test
        scores will become invalid upon this voluntary retest. They must also be briefed that
        there is a possibility their scores will not improve or a confirmation test may be required.
        Furthermore, they must fully understand they will be disqualified for Air Force
        enlistment should their new score fall below minimum AF enlistment standards.
     2.26.8. An applicant who has answered at least one question on the ASVAB is considered to
     have tested. (Confirmation testing does not constitute a retest unless the entire battery is
     given.)

 NOTES:
 1. No waivers or exceptions.
 2. After the first retest, a 30-day wait for second retest is mandatory. After the second retest, a 6-
 month wait for any further retesting is mandatory. There is a mandatory 6-month wait for retesting
 when the previous test has been invalidated.
 3. Do not administer any test to members currently on AD with any branch of the Armed Forces
 (excluding members of AFRC or ANG units).
 4. A properly completed USMEPCOM Form 680A, Request for Examination, is authority for retest.
 EA recruiters will document any previous version of the ASVAB taken by the applicant on the
 form.
 5. Requests for special testing exceptions may be submitted in unusual circumstances only, but must
 include the following information:
 5.1. Applicant‘s full name and SSN.
 5.2. Type of test taken, date of initial test, scores obtained, and testing location.
 5.3. Justification for retest, to include unusual circumstances. Note: Illness, fatigue, and scores
 inconsistent with applicant‘s academic background do not constitute unusual circumstances.
 6. Retests are governed by AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System, 17 Feb 2009.
2.27. Special Purpose Testing:
     2.27.1. When necessary, special purpose tests are administered to determine an applicant‘s
     qualification for specific occupational specialties. Applicants not otherwise qualified for a
     specific AFSC will not take the special test. Special purpose testing at other than the MEPS
     is not permitted except as directed by Headquarters, United States Military Entrance
     Processing Command (HQ USMEPCOM) or authorized by USMEPCOM sector
     commanders.
     2.27.2. TTMS-JM will not offer an AFSC unless qualifying test results are entered into
     AFRISS. Applicants who desire to select these AFSCs must be given the appropriate special
     test. The MLS must ensure pass or fail special test scores are entered in AFRISS and
     recorded on enlistment documents. Additionally, the test scoring worksheet, DD Form
     1304.12K, or USMEPCOM 680 ADP Report, Status A, with special test scores will be
     included in the file forwarded to BMT on AD. Retesting applicants is not normally approved.

   In unusual circumstances, submit a waiver request according to Table 2.2. Individuals in the
   DEP are authorized to take special purpose tests.
2.28. Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB). The DLAB evaluates the ability to
complete formal courses in foreign language training. This test is required for entry into AFSC
1N3X1, Cryptologic Linguist Apprentice; and 1A8X1, Airborne Cryptologic Linguist
Apprentice. Languages are divided into four categories, based on difficulty. Minimum DLAB
score is 100.
2.29. Electronic Data Processing Test (EDPT). The EDPT evaluates the basic ability to
complete a formal course dealing with the programming of electronic data processing equipment.
This test is required for entry into AFSC 3C0X2, Communications-Computer System
Programmer Apprentice and 9S100, Technical Applications Apprentice.
2.30. English Comprehension Language Test (ECLT) or American Language Course
Placement Test (ALCPT). The ECLT and ALCPT are available only at the MEPS in San Juan,
Puerto Rico. When the original scores indicate a possible comprehension disability, the ECLT or
ALCPT should be administered to applicants before ASVAB retesting. A score of 70 verifies the
requirement that an applicant is able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language.
If an ECLT or ALCPT retest is required, the recruiter must give the MEPS 30 days notification
and have results documented in AFRISS.
2.31. Applicant Qualifying and Testing:
   2.31.1. Applicants tentatively qualified for any commissioning program that elect to apply
   solely for the NPS program must sign and date the following statement in the remarks section
   of their DD Form 1966 (filled out by the MEPS): ―I have been counseled on Air Force
   commissioning programs and elect to apply only for the enlisted program.‖ Conversely,
   applicants applying concurrently for EA and commissioning programs must complete the
   statement of understanding in Attachment 5 of this instruction.
   2.31.2. An applicant who agrees to enter AD before receiving board results must read and
   sign his or her name and date after the following statement in the remarks section of the DD
   Form 1966 (filled out by the MEPS): ―I understand and agree to my Active Duty service
   commitment as an enlisted member and acknowledge I will not be released to accept a
   commissioning opportunity resulting from my selection board.‖
   2.31.3. MEPS LNCOs will establish an EAD availability date no earlier than 30 days after
   the applicant‘s last board cycle closes and results are published. If applicants elect to enlist
   on AD before receiving selection board results, they are obligated to honor their enlistment
   and will not be released from AD if selected for a scholarship or commission.
   2.31.4. Candidates for potential dual credit will be identified in advance, tracked, and
   accounted for. Squadron operations flight commanders will manage and track actions related
   to concurrent LO and EA processing. EA applicants who accept scholarships, appointments,
   or direct commissions before they enter AD must be cancelled. Squadron operations must
   cancel all selects within 10 duty days of the board results release date, or net reservation
   credit will not be restored. This cancellation will result in temporary loss of reservation net
   reservation credit. Squadrons must request credit restoration from HQ AFRS/RSOAP (210-
   565-0317) with a copy of the applicant‘s letter of intent to accept a scholarship, appointment,
   or commission. Requests must identify the program the applicant was selected for, the board
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                      61


   release date, and the applicant‘s personal information including: the applicant‘s name, SSN,
   DEP date, AFSC, EAD date, RIC, and cancellation date. HQ AFRS/RSOAP will restore
   credit after HQ AFRS/RSOC verifies the applicant‘s acceptance.
2.32. Processing Applicants to MEPS:
   2.32.1. Only applicants who are test qualified and motivated to join the Air Force will be
   scheduled for MEPS processing. One-stop processing (test and physical) is authorized when
   advantageous to the Air Force. Before scheduling applicants for one-stop processing,
   recruiters should have a high degree of confidence that the applicant will pass the ASVAB
   test. In these cases, EST or CAST screening should have been conducted and results
   documented in AFRISS.
   2.32.2. Recruiters are responsible for completing all required forms (or IMTs) and
   forwarding applications to arrive at the MEPS at least one duty day before the applicant‘s
   arrival. Recruiters are also responsible for ensuring all source documents, certified copies of
   appropriate source documents, and/or legible copies of source documents arrive at the MEPS
   at least one duty day before the applicant‘s arrival to allow proper validation and verification
   by the MEPS LNCO.
   2.32.3. Applications may arrive at MEPS less than one duty day prior to applicant
   processing with the approval of the operations flight commander or flight chief. The
   operations flight chief will maintain a log to document these exceptions. If faxed copies of
   source documents are used by the LNCO for initial validation and verification, the original
   source documents or certified copies of the source documents must still be reviewed by the
   MEPS LNCO before the applicant may process or ship. Note: Several agencies issue
   colored-coded documents to prohibit copying. If documents cannot be faxed legibly, the
   original documents must still be used for verification and validation before applicant
   processing.
   2.32.4. Applicants who arrive at the MEPS to process without original or certified copies of
   required source documents may be allowed to continue processing with the approval of the
   squadron operations flight commander or operations flight chief. However, they will not be
   allowed to ship without the MLS‘s verification and validation of the original or certified
   copies of the source documents.
   2.32.5. All recruiting personnel must adhere to any state laws that prohibit copying original
   documents.
2.33. Buddy Flights. A buddy flight must consist of at least two, but not more than nine, NPS
applicants who want to enlist and remain together during BMT. Flights must consist of all
women or all men; they will not be mixed. Before buddy flight consideration by HQ AFRS,
squadrons will ensure applicants for buddy flights currently hold a job reservation leaving in the
same month. The job choices provided to HQ AFRS/RSOPB must include the job the applicant
is currently holding. See paragraph 4.10 for specific procedures.
2.34. Congressman Hebert Advanced Placement Award (CHAPA):
   2.34.1. This award is given as a joint effort between the AFRS and the JROTC of all service
   branches to reward and recruit top quality cadets opting to enter the Air Force enlisted ranks.
   Up to two cadets may be selected each school year from each unit. The JROTC science
 62                                                            AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   instructor will make the selections and submit the names to the nearest AFRS squadron
   commander.
   2.34.2. The responsible recruiter will process the candidates to determine whether they are
   qualified. Once th e applicant is fully qualified and his or her job preferences and date of
   availability are loaded in TTMS-JM, the MEPS contacts squadron operations who, in turn,
   faxes a copy of the CHAPA letter (with applicant‘s SSN) to HQ AFRS/RSOPB. The
   applicant may list up to five GTEP skills and/or one AI for special reservation consideration.
2.35. US Air Force Band Enlistment Program:
   2.35.1. Applicants wanting to enlist in the band must audition if they claim proficiency in a
   musical instrument.
   2.35.2. AF IMT 485, Application for Enlistment - US Air Force Band, is completed as
   follows: (Note: AF IMT 485 is prescribed in AFI 36-2002. Refer to that publication for
   guidance on filling out this IMT.)
       2.35.2.1. The recruiter completes Section I.
       2.35.2.2. The band director conducting the audition completes Section II.
       2.35.2.3. The applicant completes Section III.
       2.35.2.4. HQ AFRS/RSOPB completes Section IV. Note: If the applicant is otherwise
       qualified, the LNCO completes this section and obtains an assignment reservation from
       HQ AFRS/RSOPB.
       2.35.2.5. If a waiver is needed, HQ AFPC completes Section V.
   2.35.3. Before the applicant auditions, the recruiter informs the applicant that:
       2.35.3.1. He or she must bear all expenses in connection with the audition.
       2.35.3.2. Final approval for enlistment into the band program must come from HQ
       AFRS/RSOP. Audition approval does not guarantee enlistment into the band program
       even if a vacancy exists.
   2.35.4. The applicant auditions before an Air Force band leader at the nearest Air Force base
   having an Air Force band.
2.36. Voice Audition for a Radio-Television Broadcasting Specialist. Applicants desiring an
assignment in GTEP AFSC 3N0X2, Radio-Television Broadcasting Specialist, with acceptance
into the Basic Broadcaster Course at Defense Information School (DINFOS), must complete and
pass a voice audition. These following procedures are provided for preparing and submitting a
voice audition package:
   2.36.1. Specifics:
       2.36.1.1. The applicant should go to the nearest Air Force base public affairs office or, as
       an alternative; he or she may cut a tape at a local, cooperating radio station under
       recruiter supervision. A news script, a spot script, five sentences, and an extemporaneous
       segment will be used in all cases to test the applicant‘s ability to read news copy and
       allow DINFOS to evaluate his or her voice in specific areas. See Attachment 6 for the
       audition script, five-sentence read, and sample cover memorandum.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                   63


     2.36.1.2. Do not send prerecorded ―air checks.‖ The style of delivery, pacing, and
     phrasing in such tapes is usually dictated by the radio station; and it is impossible to
     judge the voice properly. Therefore, DINFOS will not evaluate ―air checks‖ tapes.
     2.36.1.3. Ensure there is a quiet area, free of background noises for the recording
     session. Allow the applicant no more than 15 minutes to rehearse the script and sentences
     out loud. Advise the applicant to communicate in a natural tone and not use an
     ―announcer‘s delivery.‖ Be sure the applicant uses his or her name, not an alias or ―air‖
     name. Allow only one ―take‖ or attempt per individual. Each applicant may submit a
     maximum of four auditions in a 12-month period. A voice audition pass is valid for 1
     year.
  2.36.2. Extemporaneous Segment:
     2.36.2.1. The applicant will have 5 minutes to think about what to say during the
     segment. He or she should speak in a normal, conversational tone. This segment is an
     essential part of the voice audition. It helps DINFOS evaluate an applicant‘s potential for
     on-the-scene news reporting and other jobs that require extemporaneous speaking.
     2.36.2.2. The applicant will speak for 60 seconds about why he or she wants to become a
     military broadcaster. He or she may also include goals for the future. This portion of the
     audition must not be read.
  2.36.3. Equipment:
     2.36.3.1. Auditions should be recorded digitally or on a cassette tape, using a single-
     track recorded on one side only. Do not use multi-track stereo microcassettes. Speak
     directly into the microphone. Do not use electronic ―enrichment‖ devices such as
     equalizers, reverb, production music, etc., because DINFOS will not evaluate these tapes.
     Use only new or completely erased tapes.
     2.36.3.2. If more than one applicant is recorded, allow at least a 20-second pause
     between takes and identify each take with the applicant‘s name and address. Applicants
     are allowed only one take; do not send multiple takes.
  2.36.4. Mailing:
     2.36.4.1. Each submission must be accompanied by a cover memorandum that follows
     the format in Attachment 6.
     2.36.4.2. Colds, sinus conditions, or other physical circumstances that may affect the
     applicant‘s voice quality should be noted in the special comments section of the
     memorandum. Reschedule the audition if the illness severely affects voice quality.
     2.36.4.3. Each cassette must be labeled to identify the submitting activity and the person
     being auditioned. If more than one voice is recorded on a tape, the label must identify the
     individuals in sequence of recording. Tapes will not be returned. Mail tapes and a cover
     memorandum to: Commandant, Defense Information School, 6500 Mapes Rd, ATTN:
     Voice Audition/BWAS, Fort Meade, MD 20755-5620.
  2.36.5. Notification of Audition Results. Tapes are handled on a first-come, first-served
  basis. Tapes received via express mail will be processed in the order received. Include a
  return mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and/or e-mail address to ensure
 64                                                          AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   proper return of the confirmation memorandum. The voice diagnostic administrator‘s phone
   number at Fort George Meade is (301) 677-4287.
   2.36.6. Notice to Applicant of Selection or Non-selection. DINFOS forwards the notice of
   selection or non-selection directly to the applicant‘s home address. In general, a favorable
   response will state: ―Congratulations! Our Voice Audition Board has determined you have
   met the entry-level voice standard for broadcast training at the Defense Information School.
   The audition results are good for 1 year, which means you must be enrolled in the Basic
   Broadcaster Course before . . . .‖
   2.36.7. Notice of Applicant’s Selection. If the applicant meets all other enlistment criteria,
   the LNCO or squadron operations member will reserve the assignment through TTMS-JM;
   attach a copy of the selection letter to AF Form 3007, Guaranteed Training Enlistment
   Agreement - Nonprior Service - United States Air Force; and forwards the packages to HQ
   AFPC and BMT.
   2.36.8. Training. As a minimum, training will include broadcast writing and radio and
   television production techniques. Graduates are qualified to assume broadcast duties upon
   arrival at their Armed Forces Radio and Television (AFRT) assignment.
   2.36.9. Assignment. After training, assignment will be to one of the AFRT facilities that
   conduct information and entertainment programs for personnel stationed overseas and in
   isolated areas of the US where commercial facilities are not available or are inadequate.
   Oversea areas include, but are not limited to, AFRT outlets in Japan, Okinawa, Johnson
   Island, Wake Island, Greenland, Spain, Norway, Turkey, Greece, Ascension Island, the
   Azores, Alaska, and Guam.
   2.36.10. Overseas Imbalanced AFSC. Because this AFSC is overseas imbalanced,
   possibilities are good that an applicant will have a secondary AFSC while stationed in the
   US.
2.37. Physical Ability and Stamina Test (PAST):
   2.37.1. See current PAST PGM for PAST requirements and criteria.
   2.37.2. This test is administered to applicants who are applying for GTEP AFSC 1T231,

   Weather (SOWT), 1C431, Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), 1T031, Survival Evasion
   Resistance and Escape (SERE), 3E831, Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD).
   2.37.3. Test results are valid for 6 months or while in DEP, but applicants must be
   encouraged to continue to meet or exceed the standards. Before taking the PAST, applicants
   must:
      2.37.3.1. Have passed the standard enlistment physical.
      2.37.3.2. Fill out AFRS Form 7, Liability Release and Express Assumption of Risk –
      Physical Ability and Stamina Test (PAST).
   2.37.4. The PAST may be administered by CCT or PJ personnel while being observed by
   recruiting personnel. Additionally, recruiting squadrons may authorize squadron headquarters
   personnel to administer the PAST.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                    65


   2.37.5. The test may be administered locally by a recruiting squadron representative
   designated by the squadron commander. (A certified lifeguard must be present during the
   PAST.) The test administrator must be at or above the flight chief level. The number of
   PAST administrators is left to the discretion of the squadron commander, but these
   administrators must be totally familiar with the PAST. They must also have and be familiar
   with the videotape entitled ―PAST Test Procedures.‖ High school swimming coaches,
   YMCA swimming instructors, or certified Red Cross swimming instructors may also
   administer the PAST after familiarization with the videotape and when accompanied by a
   designated squadron PAST administrator.
2.38. Special Procedures for Linguists:
   2.38.1. Recruiters or MEPS LNCOs will identify applicants who are eligible for special
   testing based on ASVAB scores, sensitivity job code (SJC), and other qualifications. They
   will schedule applicants who express an interest in foreign languages and qualify for the
   DLAB testing as soon as possible.
   2.38.2. Applicants will be given a copy of AFRS Form 1329, Language Preference
   Questionnaire, to complete. Once completed, the form will be put into the package given to
   BMT.
2.39. Delayed Entry Program (DEP):
   2.39.1. Applicants with no PS are allowed to enter the DEP for 365 days. (HQ AF/A1P may
   authorize an extension of up to 365 days after the initial 365-day period.)

   DEP automatically extended to 30 Sep of the year they are scheduled to EAD.
   2.39.3. Applicants currently in the inactive ready reserve (IRR) and members of active
   reserve or guard components who are processing for the RegAF under a conditional release
   are not allowed to enter the DEP.
   2.39.4. An applicant may reenter the DEP when it is cost-effective to do so or would benefit
   the Air Force or the applicant.

2.41. DEP Member Follow-up and DEP Commander’s Call:
   2.41.1. Recruiters will follow up with DEP members face-to-face every 30 days until 30
   days before EAD. Thirty days before EAD, a follow-up will be made and documented using
   the EAD Checklist at least every 2 weeks to include a final departure briefing. DEP
   commander‘s calls will be conducted monthly. The purpose of follow-ups and DEP
   commander‘s calls is to perpetuate leads, motivate, ensure continued qualification, and
   inform. Note: Production superintendents may waive the 30-day face-to-face requirement
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                     67

   commander) may authorize courtesy enlistments (including BOT) within the Continental
   United States (CONUS) and overseas-to-CONUS only.
   2.42.2. Prior telephone coordination between gaining and losing squadron operations staff
   members is mandatory, as is completion of AFRS Form 1375, Request for Courtesy
   Enlistment. Notification is the responsibility of the applicant‘s recruiter and must be
   coordinated immediately after a need for a courtesy enlistment is identified, regardless of the
   applicant‘s AD date. Squadron operations must also coordinate BOT courtesy enlistments
   with HQ AFRS/RSOC. CONUS-to-overseas courtesy enlistments are authorized only in
   extreme cases and upon approval of HQ AFRS/RSOP (for enlisted program applicants) or
   HQ AFRS/RSOC (for BOT applicants).
   2.42.3. Submit requests through the group. Approval is required before an applicant departs
   the local area. Recruiters may not imply or infer that a courtesy enlistment will be routinely
   authorized.
   2.42.4. The losing MLS will:
      2.42.4.1. Ensure all required enlistment documents are sent to the gaining MEPS to
      arrive No Earlier Than (NET) 30 days and No Later Than (NLT) 15 workdays before
      scheduled AD date. For overseas courtesy enlistments send documents NET 45 days and

      2.42.4.3. QC courtesy enlistment applications and complete all suspense actions before
      the individual departs the local area.
      2.42.4.4. Ensure required documents normally retained at the enlisting MEPS are
      forwarded to the gaining MEPS as required.
      2.42.4.5. Ensure a copy of AFRS Form 1375 is included with the enlistment application.
   2.42.5. The gaining MLS will:
      2.42.5.1. QC courtesy enlistment applications and correct them as required on receipt.
      2.42.5.2. Notify the losing MLS of any disqualifying factors and request guidance.
      2.42.5.3. Keep a complete residual file for each courtesy enlistment.

      2.42.5.4. Ensure DD Form 4, Copy 1, is re-accomplished to show the regular AD place
      of enlistment in Item 4 and confirm with the applicant his/her desire to change the home
      of record in item 3. (Pen-and-ink changes are authorized by USMEPCOM Regulation
      601-23, Enlistment Processing, 1 Dec 2010.)

      2.42.7.1. Immediately contact squadron operations of a possible overseas courtesy
      enlistment and ensure AFRS Form 1375 is completed.
      2.42.7.2. Inform applicants that, with their concurrence, an attempt will be made to move
      up their EAD for departure before their move. If the EAD cannot be changed, applicants
      will enlist through an overseas facility. Information will be provided on the AFRS Form
      1375 as to when and where to enlist.
      2.42.7.3. Inform high school seniors that, if they move before graduation, they will enlist

2.43. Cancellation of Job Reservations:
   2.43.1. EA program job reservations will be canceled when the applicant becomes
   disqualified or withdraws his or her applicant status. An exception to this policy may be
   appropriate when certain temporary conditions exist. The squadron operations officer will
   coordinate with the production superintendent and determine whether a cancellation is
   required based on the circumstances of each individual case. When a job reservation is
   canceled for any reason, the applicant will not be booked for another reservation under any
   circumstances until he or she is rendered fully qualified.
   2.43.2. The responsible operations flight will be notified immediately of any EA, LO or HP
   program applicant who becomes permanently or temporarily disqualified for any reason or

   apply the following definitions:
      2.43.2.1. Withdrawal of applicant status—An applicant who elects not to enter AD has
      terminated his or her applicant status. The flight chief may contact these individuals and
      attempt to re-motivate and/or validate their status.
      2.43.2.2. Temporary disqualification—A non-medical condition that renders an applicant
      disqualified for enlistment, but can be resolved before AD.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                           69

 NOTES:
 1. When a recruiter becomes aware of an EA, LO or HP applicant‘s intent to withdraw (refuse or decline),
 the recruiter will immediately notify the flight chief and annotate AFRISS with the appropriate
 information. The flight chief will immediately notify squadron operations of the cancellation (or pending
 cancellation) and whether or not the flight chief wishes to conduct an interview (telephonic or face to face)
 in an attempt to ―resell‖ the applicant. The interview must be conducted within 7 calendar days. If the
 interview confirms the applicant‘s intent to withdraw, the applicant refuses the appointment, or contact
 with the applicant cannot be established within 7 calendar days, the flight chief will immediately notify
 squadron operations and the reservation will be canceled that day. Note: Local policies may be more
 restrictive.
 2. Applicants will not be booked for another reservation until they are rendered fully qualified or, in cases
 of withdrawal, they reinstate their applicant status.
 3. The squadron operations officer or flight chief will coordinate with the production superintendent to
 decide what course of action to take on applicants with a temporary medical disqualification that might be
 resolved before the scheduled AD date. MEPS liaisons will document an MFR in AFRISS, stating the
 action taken, reasons, and name of the individual rendering the decision. If the decision is to cancel, note 2
 applies.
 4. Squadron commanders will decide whether a job reservation will be canceled while the applicant‘s
 waiver or eligibility determination is under consideration. Factors such as the scheduled AD date, level of
 70                                                             AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


 approval authority, and time required to process the requested action must be taken into account. MEPS
 liaisons will record a memorandum for record, documenting the commander‘s decision in AFRISS. If the
 decision is to cancel, apply note 2. During the commander‘s absences, the squadron operations commander
 may make the cancellation decision.
2.44. NPS and PS Processing. Use Table 2.4 to determine which forms or IMTs are required
for enlistment. In addition to those required in Table 2.4, other documents may be required; for
example, a copy of the enlistee‘s birth certificate, high school diploma, discharge orders, official
transcripts, valid driver‘s license, and marriage certificate; a copy each child‘s birth certificate
(from the state vital statistics agency); and a copy of the spouse‘s SSN card.

 NOTES:
 1. See paragraph 2.46 for DD Form 785 procedures and Attachment 4 for addresses.
 2. Electronic fingerprints are taken at the MEPS.
 3. All NPS applicants (PS-ineligible) will initial the elected College Loan Repayment Program
 (CLRP) option on this form (default statement printed out of AFRISS). Current AFRS PGMs
 concerning the CLRP also applies.
 4. Required for PS applicants wishing to apply for recruiting duty.
2.45. Overseas Enlistment Processing With Recruiter Support. This support applies to
overseas processing when recruiting personnel are present, but MEPS support is not available. It
also applies to Alaska when transportation arrangements for applicants in outlying areas dictate.
The following rules apply:
   2.45.1. The recruiter is responsible for prequalifying and processing applicants.
   2.45.2. The recruiter is responsible for administrative actions normally performed by the
   MEPS staff, and the recruiter is responsible for LNCO duties.
       2.45.2.1. Ensure applicant is counseled on listing an appropriate home of record (HOR).
       Most applicants enlisting at overseas locations are only residing at those location
       temporarily as a result of their parent‘s service overseas. In these circumstances the
       applicant should consider a HOR they are most likely to wish to return to at a CONUS
       location. In many cases they may use the HOR address claimed by parent or another
       more permanent CONUS address.
   2.45.3. On EAD, the recruiter will forward a copy of the DD Form 1966, Copy 1, to the
   appropriate MEPS (for Asia, the Honolulu MEPS; for Europe, the New York [Ft. Hamilton]
   MEPS) for entry into the USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (MIRS).
   2.45.4. Base medical personnel will perform the enlistment physical. All overseas physicals
   will be reviewed by the SG prior to EAD. Physical recheck within 14 days of enlistment (all
   applicants). They will place special emphasis on weight standards and BFM to ensure the
   applicant is within Air Force standards at the time of enlistment.
   2.45.5. The applicant will enter AD with sufficient time to travel to BMT and arrive between
   Monday and Thursday of the EAD week. This allows for delays in transportation
   arrangements. Any exception to this policy must be approved by HQ AFRS/RSOP.
2.46. Applicants Applying for an NPS or PS Program Who Were Previously Eliminated
From Officer Candidate Training:
   2.46.1. Before processing, a DD Form 785 or a letter from the releasing agency (containing
   the same information as a DD Form 785) is required for all applicants previously eliminated
   from officer candidate training. Request a copy of the DD Form 785 according to Attachment
   4.
   2.46.2. Applicants are eligible for enlistment processing unless the elimination action was
   based on punitive or administrative actions involving defective character traits, unsuitability,
   drug abuse, etc. In questionable cases, a request for an enlistment eligibility determination
   (EED) should be forwarded through the group to HQ AFRS/RSOP via AFRISS workflow.
   Include copies of the applicant‘s DD Form 785 or letter, a DD Form 214 or 215 (as
   appropriate), and a statement of circumstances from the applicant. Exception: Disenrolled
 72                                                              AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   AFROTC and USAFA cadets required to fulfill AD service obligation and issued a DD Form
   368 from AFPC Enlisted Accessions are authorized to enlist without a DD Form 785 review
   by HQ AFRS/RSOP. See table 1.1 Note 13.
2.47. Age. The applicant must be less than 28 years old as of the date of entry onto AD. Use
Attachment 2 to compute the maximum age for PS applicants. The Air Force has no obligation to
enlist persons who become ineligible during processing or in the DEP.
2.48. Physical Standards:
   2.48.1. Each applicant must be physically qualified according to DoDI 6130.03. Physicals
   are valid for 24 months from the date of the physical.
2.49. Preparation for Initial Training:
   2.49.1. BMT, BOT, or COT applicants who wear contact lenses or glasses must take a pair
   of their glasses with them (preferably with a current prescription) to their initial training base.
   It will take up to 4 weeks for an applicant‘s to receive his or her initial pair of Air Force-
   issued glasses. WARNING: Extended wear of contact lenses during training can cause
   permanent damage to the applicant‘s vision.
   2.49.2. NPS, PS, BOT, and COT applicants are required to establish a bank account prior to
   departing for training or direct duty because they are required to directly deposit their pay in
   a bank. To sign up for direct deposit service, applicants will fill out an SF 1199A, Direct
   Deposit Sign-Up, as follows: Note: SF 1199A can be accessed in .pdf format at the following
   Web site: http://e-publishing.af.mil/forms/otherforms.asp under ―other Standard Forms at
   GSA.‖
       2.49.2.1. Applicants will complete Section I, Section II is not applicable, and the
       applicant‘s financial institution will complete Section III.
       2.49.2.2. Applicants will hand-carry a completed (original) SF 1199A to their initial
       training destination or duty station and turn it in during their initial finance briefing.
   2.49.3. Applicants will take a checkbook, ATM card, etc., to access their direct deposit
   account when regular pay periods begin. Basic trainees will receive their initial payment
   through a government debit card. The account on this card will only contain enough money
   for items and services needed in BMT. Because the initial payments will not be sufficient to
   cover debts such as car payments, spouse‘s rent, utilities, etc., applicants should make
   appropriate financial arrangements for their debts prior to leaving for BMT.
   2.49.4. Applicants are prohibited from taking ANY aerosol products to BMT.

                                          Chapter 3

CRITERIA WAIVERS, ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS (ED), AND EXCEPTIONS
                          TO POLICY (ETP)

3.1. General Conditions. Air Force applicants must be morally and financially sound, not
encumbered with dependency limitations for assignment availability or while on deployment. If
an applicant is not qualified, a recruiter may request a criteria waiver under some conditions.
When there are questions about a qualified applicant‘s suitability, a commander must make a
waiver or eligibility determination (ED). All waivers, EDs, and ETPs or operational standards
will be sent through the chain of command, using the appropriate AFRISS workflow.
3.2. Criteria Waivers:
   3.2.1. Recruiters may initiate moral, dependency, or drug waiver requests on unqualified
   applicants if the applicants are (other than the waiverable conditions) highly qualified and
   motivated to join the Air Force. Applicants must have displayed sufficient mitigating
   circumstances that clearly justify a waiver. All waiver actions must be made in the best
   interest of the Air Force.
   3.2.2. A disqualified applicant who requests a waiver must bear any expenses incurred for
   police record checks. When document fees are associated with verifying an applicant‘s
   qualifications, the recruiter is authorized reimbursement.
   3.2.3. Do not schedule an applicant for a physical examination until the waiver, ED, or ETP
   is approved. All waiver requests for an individual will be submitted at one time. The waiver
   authority will enter approvals or disapprovals in AFRISS.
3.3. Eligibility Determinations (ED). An ED is the formal process by which approval
authorities review circumstances that place doubt on an otherwise qualified applicant‘s
suitability. EDs include the following:
   3.3.1. Moral eligibility determinations (MED), as described in paragraph 3.18.
   3.3.2. Enlistment eligibility determinations (EED), as described in paragraph 3.19.
   3.3.3. Drug-related eligibility determinations (DRED), as described in paragraph 3.22.
   3.3.4. Dependency eligibility determinations (DED), as described in paragraph 3.24.
   3.3.5. Financial eligibility determinations (FED), as described in paragraph 3.26.
3.4. Exceptions to Policy (ETP). ETPs are exceptions to a standard Air Force publication
(AFI, AETCI, AFRSI, etc.) or an approved policy memorandum. An ETP is a formal process by
which authorized approval authorities review exceptional circumstances surrounding an
applicant‘s disqualifying factor for enlistment or commission. ETPs are rare. Consider an ETP
when an AF need may go unmet and/or a compelling/sufficient mitigating circumstance exist to
clearly justify an ETP.
3.5. Waiver and ED Procedures. Waivers and EDs are judgment calls. As such, documents
submitted must provide the facts and background information necessary for the waiver approval
authority to make informed decisions. It is good practice to include other documents in AFRISS
that reflect the applicant‘s moral history along with a good ―word picture,‖ describing facts
 74                                                             AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


behind the applicant‘s circumstances. Approval authorities will document favorable or
unfavorable determinations in AFRISS for both EA, HP and LO program applicants. Waivers,
EDs, and ETP requests for an individual will all be submitted at one time. Squadrons will retain
original documents for waivers being sent to approval authorities above squadron level.
3.6. Validity and Waiting Periods. Waivers, EDs, and ETPs are valid as follows: EA—for as
long as the applicant is job committed; HP—for 12 months after approval; and BOT —for 6
months and/or two selection boards. BOT and HP waivers will remain valid until EAD for
selects. Disapproved waivers, EDs, and ETPs may be resubmitted 6 months after disapproval if
significant mitigating data was not considered in the original request; the recruiter may resubmit
the waiver, ED, or ETP within the 6-month waiting period.
3.7. Approval Authorities. Only approval authorities (commanders, vice commanders, deputy
commanders, HQ AFRS/RSOP, HQ AFRS/RSOC, HQ AFRS/RSO, HQ AFPC/DPS, HQ AFPC
Enlisted Accessions, and HQ USAF/A1P) may render decisions on waivers, EDs, and ETPs.
The AFRS/CC is the final approval authority for all PS officer waivers, ED‘s, and ETP‘s.
Approval authorities at any level may approve or disapprove the request, even if they are not the
final approval authority. If the approval authority is not available, elevate the request to the next
higher level of command. Approval authority will not be delegated to a lower level.
3.8. Definitions. The following terms have precise meanings in the context of this instruction:
   3.8.1. Dependents (Family Members). For accession purposes, the following terms define
   dependents:
       3.8.1.1. A spouse.
       3.8.1.2. Natural children (born in or out of wedlock) of, or children adopted by, an
       applicant who are unmarried and under 18 years of age, regardless of whether the
       applicant has physical or legal custody. For male applicants, the term ―natural child‖
       includes any child or live fetus claimed by the applicant or determined to be his, by a
       court order (legal). ―Joint custody‖ is considered legal or physical custody. For natural
       children, if the applicant can furnish proof of permanent transfer of legal custody of
       minor dependents to another individual as a result of adoption (if actual transfer of
       custody has occurred), the children are not considered dependents for accession purposes.
       3.8.1.3. Stepchildren (a spouse‘s children from a former relationship) under 18 years of
       age, whether or not they reside with the applicant.
       3.8.1.4. Any person under 18 years if age whom the applicant or spouse claims as a
       dependent, whether or not the applicant or spouse has custody.
       3.8.1.5. Any person over 18 years of age incapable of self-care for whom the applicant or
       spouse has assumed responsibility for care.
   3.8.2. Adjudicating Authority. Any government official who is empowered to make
   findings or determinations concerning alleged criminal offenses (adult and juvenile) and
   establish responsibility for commission of the offense. Examples include judges, courts,
   magistrates, prosecutors, hearing officers, commanders (for Article 15 actions, suspension of
   dependent privileges, or similar actions), probation officers, juvenile referees, and parole
   officers or boards.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                       75


   3.8.3. Conviction. The act of finding a person guilty of a crime, offense, or other violation
   of the law by an adjudicating authority. Includes fines and forfeiture of bond in lieu of trial.
   3.8.4. Adverse Adjudication (Adult or Juvenile). A finding, decision, sentence, or
   judgment that was other than unconditionally dropped, dismissed, or acquitted. If the
   adjudicating authority places a condition or restraint that leads to dismissal or is dismissed
   after a certain period of time, drops the charges, acquits, or the records are later expunged,
   the adjudication is still adverse. Suspension of sentence, pardon, not processed, or dismissal
   after compliance with imposed conditions is also adverse adjudication. If a person is charged
   and convicted of violating any federal (including UCMJ offenses), state, or municipal law or
   ordinance, that conviction is considered an adverse adjudication. The following is an
   example of a situation where there was no adverse adjudication: A shoplifter who is
   reprimanded and required by the on-scene police officer, store security guard, or manager to
   pay for the item before leaving the store has not been found guilty, convicted, or adversely
   adjudicated because no legal proceedings were instituted.
   3.8.5. Restitution. Any compensation in time, labor, or money for the adverse effects of an
   offense limited to agreements resulting from judicial or prosecutorial involvement. For
   example, an individual is adversely adjudicated for vandalism and is ordered to replace or
   repair the damaged property.
   3.8.6. Self-Admitted Offenses. Offenses voluntarily disclosed by an applicant when he or
   she was never exposed to a formal legal proceeding. Although self-admitted offenses are not
   to be treated as an admission of guilt, they may require an ED.
   3.8.7. Restraint. Legally imposed restrictions, such as confinement, suspended sentence of
   confinement, parole, probation (supervised or unsupervised), work detail, pretrial conditions,
   restrictions from freedom of movement, periods of imposed community service, or required
   reporting to or supervision by a probation officer or other official. Being barred from a
   military installation or the facilities on the installation is also restraint. Do not process an
   applicant who is under restraint. A 90 day waiting period is required following release from
   restraint (paragraph 3.16). (Exception: Completion of community service, suspended
   sentences for minor traffic offenses, and restraint for offenses that do not require a waiver, do
   not require the 90 day waiting period.) Unconditional suspension of sentences and paid or
   suspended fines are not restraints.
   3.8.8. Criminal History Information. The applicant is the primary source of information
   about criminal activities and law violations. Record all law violations (to include juvenile and
   minor traffic offenses regardless of disposition) in AFRISS. Review any court documents the
   applicant can provide and include legible copies with the waiver, ED, or ETP, if appropriate.
3.9. Categories of Moral Offenses. Quality and the good of the Air Force must be the
overriding factor in the submission and approval of moral waivers. The following categories list
offenses differentiated by degrees of seriousness:
   3.9.1. Category 1 offenses (paragraph 3.10). Law violations of MAJOR MISCONDUCT
   offense(s) where the adverse adjudication was a finding of guilty and the charge was not
   reduced resulting in an adult major misconduct waiver or law violations of MAJOR
   MISCONDUCT offense(s) where the adverse adjudication resulted in the charges being
 76                                                             AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   dropped, dismissed, expunged, reduced, or some other diversion program where conditions
   were placed on the violator resulting a major misconduct granted by AFRS/CC or CV.
   3.9.2. Category 2 offenses (paragraph 3.11). Law violations of MAJOR MISCONDUCT
   offense(s) where the adverse adjudication was a finding of guilty and the charge was not
   reduced or law violations of MAJOR MISCONDUCT offense(s) where the adverse
   adjudication resulted in the charges being dropped, dismissed, expunged, reduced, or some
   other diversion program where conditions were placed on the violator resulting in a major
   misconduct waiver granted by AFRS Group or Deputy Group CC.
   3.9.3. Category 3 offenses (paragraph 3.12) are serious offenses. Only a squadron
   commander or higher may waive a conviction for these offenses.
   3.9.4. Category 4 offenses (paragraph 3.13) are less serious offenses. Two convictions in
   the last 3 years or three or more convictions in a lifetime require a waiver by a squadron
   commander or higher for entry into the Air Force.
   3.9.5. Category 5 offenses (paragraph 3.14) are traffic offenses. Six or more convictions in
   any 365-day period in the last 3 years require a waiver by a squadron commander or higher
   for entry into the Air Force.
3.10. Category 1 Moral Offenses. Figure 3.1 contains a list of offenses to use as a guide for
this category. Consider a violation of a similar nature or seriousness as a Category 1 offense. A
conviction or adverse adjudication for one or more of the offenses in Figure 3.1 is disqualifying
for entry into the Air Force. Waivers for these offenses must be approved by the AFRS/CC or
CV.

3.11. Category 2 Moral Offenses. Figure 3.2 contains a list of offenses to use as a guide for
this category. Consider a violation of a similar nature or seriousness as a Category 2 offense. In
doubtful cases, treat the offense as a Category 2 offense when the maximum possible
confinement under local law exceeds 1 year. A conviction or adverse adjudication for one or
more of the offenses in Figure 3.2 is disqualifying for entry into the Air Force. Waivers for these
offenses must be approved by a group commander or deputy commander.

this category. Consider violations of a similar nature (boating, aviation, recreational vehicle
offenses, etc.) as Category 3 offenses. In doubtful cases, treat the offense as a Category 3 offense
when the maximum possible confinement under local law exceeds 4 months, but not more that 1
year. Conviction or adverse adjudication for one or more of the offenses in Figure 3.3 is

3.13. Category 4 Moral Offenses. Figure 3.4 contains a list of offenses to use as a guide for
this category. Consider traffic violations treated as serious by law enforcement agencies as
Category 4 offenses (including boating, aviation, and similar recreational vehicular offenses). In
doubtful Category 4 non-traffic cases, treat similar offenses as Category 4 offenses when the
maximum possible confinement under local law is 4 months or less. Two convictions or adverse
adjudications in the last 3 years or three or more convictions or adverse adjudications in a
lifetime are disqualifying for entry into the Air Force. Waivers for these offenses must be
approved by a squadron commander.

3.14. Category 5 Moral Offenses:
3.14.1. Figure 3.5 contains a list of offenses to use as a guide for this category.
   3.14.2. Consider offenses of a similar nature (including boating, aviation, and similar
   recreational vehicular offenses) and traffic offenses treated as minor by local law
   enforcement agencies as a Category 5 offense.
   3.14.3. If the offense is for parking tickets, count and document only tickets written by law
   enforcement officers for parking in prohibited zones, regardless of the location. Do not count
   or document any overtime parking tickets and do not count any parking tickets issued by
   private security firms, campus police, etc.
   3.14.4. Conviction or adverse adjudication for six or more Category 5 offenses in a 365-day
   period in the last 3 years or five Category 5 offenses and one Category 4 traffic-related

3.15. Circumstances To Consider in Waiver Decisions. The following mitigating
circumstances should be considered in waiver decisions: immaturity attributable to age at the
time of the offense, isolated nature of the conduct, circumstances surrounding the offense, and
transitory conditions contributing to the conduct (divorce, serious illness or death in immediate
family, etc.).
3.16. Waiting Period After Restraint or Confinement. Except for completion of community
service, suspended sentences for minor traffic offenses, and restraint for non-waiverable
offenses, a 90 day waiting period is required before processing an applicant following
termination or completion of parole, probation (supervised or unsupervised), suspended
sentence, or any period of confinement or restraint as defined in paragraph 3.8.7. ETPs will be
sent via AFRISS through the group to HQ AFRS/RSOP.
3.17. Processing Moral Waivers, EDs, and ETPs. Requests will be processed using the
appropriate AFRISS workflow. It is critical to correctly describe the applicant‘s circumstances in
a factual and descriptive ―word picture‖ in AFRISS because this is the approving authority‘s
 82                                                          AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


main source of information. Omitting important facts will delay the waiver process. At a
minimum, the request package should include the following forms, IMTs, and documents:
   3.17.1. AFRS Form 1356, Applicant Waiver Worksheet; AFRS Form 1415, Waiver
   Request/Authorization; DD Form 369, Police Record Check; or AFRS Form 1419, Request
   for Evaluation and Information; as applicable (for law violations); copies of applicable court
   documents; Department of Motor Vehicles or Public Safety check (may be used for Category
   5 waivers); and AF IMT 2030 (for unlawful use or possession of marijuana). (DD Form 369
   is prescribed in DoDI 1304.2. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
   3.17.2. The applicant‘s signed and dated handwritten statement, giving complete
   circumstances surrounding each Category 1, 2, 3, and 4 offense listed on AFRS Form 1415.
   This statement must remain with the applicant‘s residual file and must be transcribed in to
   AFRISS. Note: Character reference letters are optional.
3.18. Moral Eligibility Determinations (MED):
   3.18.1. An MED will be completed on each applicant whose moral suitability is in question.
   An acquittal, dropped charge, nolle prosequi, stet processus, ACOD, delayed prosecution,
   expunged record, pretrial intervention (PTI) resulting in dropped or dismissed charges, or a
   dismissed case may not negate the significance of the underlying conduct. An MED is
   required when a person admits to or was charged, but not adversely adjudicated (see
   paragraph 3.8.4) (excluding findings of not guilty), for an offense or offenses that would
   normally require a waiver. The squadron commander is usually the approval authority.
   3.18.2. In addition, an MED is required when a waiverable offense is reduced to a non-
   waiverable offense. For example, an applicant was charged with DUI, the charge was
   reduced to reckless operation, and he or she was adversely adjudicated for reckless operation.
   3.18.3. To protect the Air Force‘s interests, MEDs are made on available information about
   a person‘s conduct rather than on the outcome of a legal proceeding. If a person is found not
   guilty by a court of law, then no waiver or MED is required for that alleged offense.
3.19. Enlistment Eligibility Determinations (EED):
   3.19.1. Squadron commanders will evaluate EEDs for PS applicants whose eligibility is in
   doubt because reenlistment and separation data is not available from DMDC or a disparity
   exists between the data reported by DMDC and the data recorded on DD Form 214, or a
   MilPDS SURF.
   3.19.2. HQ AFRS/RSO will evaluate EEDs for PS applicants whose eligibility is in doubt
   because:
      3.19.2.1. Their last EPR was a 4 or lower.
      3.19.2.2. Their duty AFSC is 9A200 (99005), 9A100 (99006), or A000 (99009) or any
      similar information found in a MilPDS SURF report.
      3.19.2.3. Guard or reserve members have a pending negative disciplinary or
      administrative action.
3.20. Additional Law Violations:
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                       83


   3.20.1. When additional law violations are disclosed or acquired, the recruiter must
   reevaluate an applicant and all additional law violations must be added to the applicant‘s
   AFRISS file. If the violation triggers a requirement for a waiver, ED, or ETP, any previously
   approved waivers, EDs, or ETPs are invalidated and must be reviewed to the highest level
   approving authority, based on previous and/or current violation, for reevaluation (i.e., if
   previous approval was CAT 2 and the add-on is a CAT 3, then the Gp/CC must approve).
   For additions (add-ons), the recruiter or flight chief must ask the HQ AFRS help desk to reset
   the waiver workflow so the waiver can be resent to the waiver authority.
   3.20.2. Any intermediate review authority may recommend disapproval of a higher-level
   waiver because of additional offenses. However, the intermediate review authority will
   annotate his or her comments in AFRISS and forward the workflow to the original approval
   authority. The applicant will not be allowed to EAD until the original approval authority
   makes a final determination.
3.21. Pre-service Drug Use and Drug Waivers:
   3.21.1. In most cases, substance abuse is disqualifying. Self-admission of pre-service
   experimental marijuana (including organic or synthetic cannabis or tetrahydrocannabinal
   (THC)) use without exposure to legal proceedings is not automatically disqualifying.
   However, any use over 15 times is disqualifying. (Refer to paragraph 3.22 for drug-related
   eligibility determinations [DRED].)
   3.21.2. Officer applicants must explain pre-service marijuana use with a handwritten
   statement in the remarks section of AF IMT 2030, using the format described in paragraph
   3.21.4.2. Transcribe applicant comments into AFRISS follow-up comments. Do not schedule
   applicants for physical processing until at least 45 days have elapsed since their last drug
   usage. Use of drug testing or disguising products is prohibited.
   3.21.3. Arrest or apprehension for possession, sale, use, or transfer of marijuana that resulted
   in dismissed charges requires an MED. Arrest or apprehension for possession or use of
   marijuana that resulted in conviction or adverse adjudication is disqualifying and requires a
   Category 2 moral waiver.
   3.21.4. Table 3 1 is a guide for determining whether a drug waiver is authorized or
   required. AFRS-level waiver requests should be sent through the group to HQ AFRS/RSOP
   or HQ AFRS/RSOC (for HP/LO applicants) for coordination and preparation. These requests
   will be processed with the appropriate AFRISS Workflow and will, at a minimum, contain
   the following documents:
      3.21.4.1. AF IMT 2030, AFRS Form 1356, AFRS Form 1415, and either DD Form 369
      (including all law violations) or AFRS Form 1419 (including all law violations).
      3.21.4.2. The applicant‘s signed handwritten statement that includes the complete
      circumstances surrounding the drug use. As a minimum, the statement must include
      specific drugs used, dates and circumstances surrounding each occurrence, specific
      reasons for the incidents, method of drug use (orally, injected, skin-popping, sniffing,
      etc.), effects produced by the drug (none, relaxation, irritability, time or visual perception
      distortion, panic, sleepiness, flashback, restlessness, loss of consciousness, increased
      insight, etc.), residual effects, current feelings toward drug abuse and use, and whether or
      not the applicant would use them again. Include any other information that would be
 84                                                           AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


       helpful in evaluating a waiver. The recruiter must ensure the statement is safeguarded
       according to the same procedures used for police record checks. This statement must
       remain with applicant‘s residual and be transcribed into AFRISS. Note: Character
       reference letters are optional.
    3.21.5. Applicants with approved drug waivers will be denied classification in certain skills.
    Use AFRS Form 1408, Job Screening Worksheet, for EA applicants.

 NOTES:
 1. A drug ETP (AFRISS Workflow) may be submitted through the chain of command to AFRS/CC in
 unique circumstances. The applicant‘s specific situation must be clearly communicated in the AFRISS
 (a ―word picture‖) remarks section.
 2. If medically approved by the MEPS CMO, the waiver may be submitted to the approving authority.
 3. The applicant will write a statement describing the circumstances surrounding the purported
 ingestion of drugs, including any effects experienced. The squadron commander will determine
 whether a drug was actually ingested. If it is determined the drug was inadvertently taken and the
 squadron commander supports waiver consideration, a drug waiver, if applicable, may be forwarded
 through the recruiting group review and approval authority to be considered for referral to the
 approval authority. If it is determined the drug was not actually taken, the squadron commander will
 complete a DRED (paragraph 3.22).4. If an applicant admits usage of the above drugs prior to 20
 January 2005 they are grandfathered and no waivers are needed
3.22. Drug-Related Eligibility Determinations (DRED):
      3.22.1. As with an MED, a DRED is made on a person‘s conduct and actions rather than on
      the outcome of a legal proceeding. Complete a DRED when an applicant‘s suitability is in
 86                                                           AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   question. Pre-service use of marijuana and any synthetic cannabis including but not limited
   to: Spice, K2, Genie, Yucatan Fire, more than 15 times will require a DRED at the squadron-
   commander level. Any use in excess of 50 times will require a DRED at the group-
   commander level. Before the physical exam, in order to determine if a DRED is necessary,
   use the number of times the applicant says he/she used marijuana/synthetic cannabis.
   Marijuana/synthetic cannabis use documented on the DD Form 2808, Report of Medical
   Examination, should be compared to information in AFRISS. Ensure the information in
   AFRISS matches the finding documented on DD Form 2808. Use the number that is
   documented on the DD Form 2808 to determine if a DRED is required.
   3.22.2. When a person admits to (or was charged with and not adversely adjudicated) an
   offense or offenses that would normally require a waiver, a DRED is required. The following
   are some other circumstances that may warrant a DRED:
      3.22.2.1. A record of arrest without conviction or adverse adjudication that resulted in
      dismissed or dropped charges for illegal possession, use, sale, manufacture, transfer, or
      transportation for sale of narcotics, cocaine, amphetamines, other stimulants (for
      example, Ritalin®), barbiturates, prescription drugs, steroids, LSD, PCP (―angel dust‖),
      other dangerous drugs and hallucinogens, or possession of drug paraphernalia.
      3.22.2.2. Excessive use of legal over-the-counter drugs (nonprescription) or wrongful
      use of non-narcotic prescription medications.
      3.22.2.3. Self-admitted use or abuse or record of arrest without conviction or adverse
      adjudication for illegal possession, use, sale, or transfer of inhalants (glue, paints,
      thinners, aerosols, amyl or butyl nitrites) and others.
3.23. Dependency Waivers: (Note: The dependency policies in Table 3.2 apply to existing
conditions and to all changes or expected changes in marital or dependency status.)
   3.23.1. The Air Force recognizes that some individuals, for personal reasons, have given up
   custody of a child or children. Transferring custody of family members for the purpose of
   entering the Air Force is prohibited and renders the enlisted programs applicant
   permanently disqualified. It is not the intent or desire of the Air Force to require any person
   to relinquish custody of his or her children to qualify for enlistment. Therefore, recruiting
   personnel must never counsel such applicants to intentionally change their marital or
   custodial status for the purpose of enlistment qualification.
   3.23.2. Single member parent applicants who, at the time of initial processing for enlistment,
   indicate they have a child or children in the custody of the other parent or another adult will
   be advised and required to certify that their intent at the time of enlistment was not to enter
   the Air Force with the express intention of regaining custody after enlistment. These
   applicants must complete an AFRS Form 1328, Statement of Understanding for Single
   Member Parent Having Dependent(s) in the Custody of Another.
   3.23.3. Advise applicants that, if they regain custody during their term of enlistment, they
   will be in violation of the stated intent of their enlistment contract. They may be subject to
   involuntary separation for fraudulent entry unless they can show cause, such as the death or
   incapacity of the other parent or custodian or a change in their marital status from single to
   married.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                   87


  3.23.4. As a minimum, dependency waiver requests will contain the following documents:
     3.23.4.1. (All requests) AF IMT 3010, AFRS Form 1415, and an original or
     authenticated copy of court orders transferring or establishing custody. If a divorce
     decree or court order places restrictions on the movement of a child across geographical
     boundaries, a notarized statement from the noncustodial parent granting permission to
     remove the child from the state must accompany the dependency waiver.
     3.23.4.2. (All requests) Flight chief or flight commander interview comments or
     memorandum documenting the applicant interview.
  3.23.4.3. (All requests) AFRS Form 1325, Financial Status of Applicant; an AFRS Form
  1356; and a credit check (paragraph 3.25).
     3.23.4.4. (HP only) A notarized statement (submitted by the applicant) containing
     current childcare long- and short-term arrangements to include attendance at officer
     training (COT or BOT).
     3.23.4.5. (NPS only) Other evidence of custody for married applicants, when a court
     order establishing custody cannot be obtained and none has been or will be issued. For
     example, a married male applicant claims to be the parent of a child born out of wedlock
     to a person who is not his spouse. A sworn affidavit from the custodial party, establishing
     that party‘s unconditional custody and (if applicable) a written child support agreement,
     is required. This does not apply to an unmarried male applicant who has a child born out
     of wedlock or who is the father of an unborn child. In this case, the applicant is
     disqualified and ineligible for waiver consideration in his current marital and dependency
     status. He is considered a single member parent with legal custody of a dependent and
     child. For single member parents without legal or physical custody and where permanent
     custody of dependents has been transferred by court order, an AFRS Form 1328 is also
     required to be in the waiver package. Note: If no family members are under age 18
     and/or incapable of self-care, this rule does not apply.

3.24. Dependency Eligibility Determinations (DED): (Note: Each DED requires an AFRS
Form 1325.)
   3.24.1. Non-prior Service (NPS). Complete DEDs on applicants married to a civilian
   spouse when the spouse has two or more children, but has legal and or physical custody of no
   more than one child. Use an approved DED to verify that the spouse does not have legal and
   or physical custody of more than one child. Complete the following statement in AFRISS
   Workflow and forward it with the court order for the squadron commander‘s review: ―I have
   reviewed the bona fide court order of (applicant spouse’s name) which was filed in (county)
   of (state) on (date). I verify that the applicant‘s spouse has legal custody of no more than one
   child. Also, I have determined that no conditions exist under which the applicant‘s spouse
   would resume custody.‖ Note: Contact the host staff judge advocate in doubtful cases.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                     89


   3.24.2. Officers. Complete a DED in AFRISS workflow when another person has legal
   custody of, or has adopted, an applicant‘s child and the applicant is unmarried, is separated,
   has a military spouse, or has a common-law wife. The commander will enter one of the three
   following statements in AFRISS to accompany the application: (Note: Contact the host staff
   judge advocate in doubtful cases.)
      3.24.2.1. Statement 1: ―I have reviewed the bona fide court order of (applicant’s name),
      which was filed in (county) of (state) on (date). I verify that legal custody of this
      applicant‘s child(ren) has been awarded to another individual. I have determined it is not
      a joint custody and contains no restrictions under which the applicant would resume
      custody.‖
      3.24.2.2. Statement 2: ―I have reviewed the bona fide court order of (applicant’s name),
      which was filed in (county) of (state) on (date). I verify that permanent transfer of legal
      custody of this applicant‘s child(ren) has been awarded to another individual as a result of
      adoption.‖ Note: Without a court order, an applicant claiming an out-of-wedlock child
      must provide a sworn affidavit, attesting that he or she does not have custody. The
      applicant will sign the statement first.
      3.24.2.3. Statement 3: ―I have reviewed the sworn affidavit of (applicant’s name) on
      (date) and have determined the applicant does not have custody of any children.‖
3.25. Credit Checks:
   3.25.1. A credit check and financial review must be completed on all applicants 18 years and
   older prior to MEPS processing. A credit check and financial review is required NLT 30
   days after 18th birthday for applicants who enter the DEP at age 17. Credit checks should
   only be accomplished on individuals the recruiter has pre-qualified to process at MEPS.
   Credit checks should be accomplished as part of the waiver/eligibility determination phase.
   3.25.2. A credit check and financial review is required on all HP and LO applicants.
   3.25.3. Credit checks and financial reviews are valid for as long as the applicant is job
   committed.
   3.25.4. Applicants will complete AFRS Form 1325, Financial Status of Applicant and
   disclosure notice, Fair Credit Reporting Act, from AFRISS. HP applicants who would access
   in the grade of captain or higher must also complete AFRS Form 1431, Medical Service
   Grade and Pay Computation Worksheet (Estimated), so applicable bonuses may be added to
   the basic compensation package.
   3.25.5. The AFRS Form 1325 must show all consumer debts (usually recurring monthly)
   such as credit cards, child support payments, vehicle payments, bank loans, student loans that
   can be deferred, rent or mortgage payments, phone, cable television, and utilities. Forward
   the AFRS Form 1325 and signed disclosure notice, AFRS Form 1431 (if applicable), and
   applicant‘s full name, SSN, date of birth, address, marital status, and anticipated grade (and
   corps for HP applicants) to squadron operations by fax, e-mail, or mail.
   3.25.6. Only authorized operations personnel will run credit checks. Authorized operations
   personnel will determine if an FED is required. Calculate the applicant‘s debt ratio by
   dividing the monthly consumer debt total by the anticipated monthly basic compensation
   package. Include both secured and unsecured debt.
 90                                                            AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


       3.25.6.1. If there is derogatory information or late payments on the credit report and/or
       the debt ratio exceeds 40 percent, document AFRISS indicating an FED is required. Send
       a copy of the report and debt-to-income worksheet to the recruiter.
       3.25.6.2. Do not use (1) a spouse‘s income or (2) income other than the applicant‘s base
       pay, to include local area BAH, to calculate the debt ratio. If the credit check reveals
       significant discrepancies, a poor credit history or if the unsecured debt ratio exceeds 40
       percent, processing will be stopped until the applicant has an approved FED (paragraph
       3.26). Note: Include the credit check with the FED. Processing may continue if the
       applicant can prove the credit check is incorrect. Never provide a copy of the credit check
       to the applicant.
   3.25.7. Applicants who have reserved a 1A831, 1N031, 1N131, 1N231, 1N330, 1N331,
   1N431, 1N531, or 1N631 require a second credit check NLT 30 and NET 45 calendar days
   prior to EAD. Annotate in AFRISS that second check was accomplished.
       3.25.7.1. MEPS Liaison will add the following statement in the remarks section of the
       AF Form 3007 or 3008: ―I understand a new credit check will be performed NET 45
       days prior to my EAD date, negative changes may disqualify me from my job. ( )‖
       3.25.7.2. Review AF Form 1408 with the applicant; determine if qualifications remain
       the same. If disqualified immediately cancel the applicant‘s reservation.
3.26. Financial Eligibility Determinations (FED):
   3.26.1. A FED contains an AFRS Form 1325 with a signed disclosure notice; an addendum
   to AF Form 24, Application for Appointment as Reserve of the Air Force or USAF Without
   Component; AFRS Form 1431 (if applicable); and a credit check. (AF Form 24 is prescribed
   in AFI 36-2005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in
   Professional Categories - Reserve of the Air Force and United States Air Force. Refer to that
   publication for guidance on filling out this form.)
   3.26.2. Commanders may require an applicant‘s explanation of financial problems to be
   entered into his or her AFRISS record. Spousal and other income may be considered in a
   FED. FED processing may be interrupted until the applicant can prove financial problems are
   cleared.
   3.26.3. A FED is required when an applicant:
       3.26.3.1. Has filed for or been declared personally bankrupt.
       3.26.3.2. Has had bills turned over to a collection agency (after age 18).
       3.26.3.3. Has had a repossession (not voluntary) in the past 5 years.
       3.26.3.4. Has intentionally written bad checks.
       3.26.3.5. Has debt ratio that exceeds 40 percent.
3.27. Other Waiverable Conditions and Procedures.
3.27.1. Waiver requests on an applicant with previous service will be accompanied by one
legible copy of his or her undeleted DD Form 214 or 215, NGB Form 22, or discharge order
from reserves, as appropriate. If the applicant is a member of an ARC component, include a DD
Form 368 (with expiration date) and AF Form 526 or MilPDS SURF. If the applicant is a
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                      91


member of a sister-service reserve component, include DD Form 368 (with expiration date) and
a legible statement of service from that personnel section. These requirements do not apply if the
previous military service history is DEP only. See Table 3.3 for other waiverable conditions.

NOTES:
1. An original and two copies of the physical are required for BOT applicants. Also refer to current
PGMs. A copy of the physical is required for each EA applicant.
2. An EA ETP for an AFSC physical or ASVAB aptitude score requirements (mechanics,
administrative, general, electronic) will be processed through the chain of command to HQ AFPC
Enlisted Accessions. The following source documents must accompany the ETP: a signed, legible
applicant statement requesting the ETP with a justification of why the ETP should be approved and a
copy of appropriate sources documents (MEPS physical, transcripts, ASVAB scores, DD Form 214,
resume, etc.). HQ AFPC, in turn, will coordinate with appropriate agencies (HQ AETC/SG, career
field managers, etc.) for approval or disapproval. Applicants will be told that this process will take
approximately 30 to 45 days.
3. Approval authorities will document approval or disapprovals in AFRISS.
4. The applicant should provide copies of all documents received at separation or discharge (BMT
record, medical record, counseling forms, entrance physical standards board proceedings,
recommendation for separation memorandums, etc.). Documents should verify the reason for
separation or discharge as stated in the applicant‘s statement and DD Form 214 or 215. (Uncertified,
legible copies are acceptable.)
5. This applies to BOT and COT applicants only. If DD Form 785 cannot be obtained, then acquire an
official memorandum from the commissioning source stating the reason for disenrollment, when the
applicant participated in the program, and a recommendation statement for future commissioning will
suffice. Applicants who are disenrolled from USAFA or AFROTC, and are pending recall to Active
Duty, are ineligible to apply. No Waiver required - If applicant was enrolled in AFROTC, but not on
contract, request a verification memorandum from the applicant‘s ROTC detachment and place a copy
of the memorandum in the brown folder of the application. Ensure the applicant provides an
explanation on the AF IMT 56, page 7, Continuation Sheet, stating applicant was not on contract, and
why the applicant chose not to continue in the commissioning program (be specific). If AFROTC
detachment cannot locate records, contact HQ AFROTC, Disenrollment Section, at (334) 953-6463
(or 0263, 3286, 7781). DSN prefix is 493. No waiver is required for NPS applicants, but, a
completed DD Form 785 is required for the application.
3.28. Fraud File. Applicants who have previously been denied enlistment, commissioning, or
appointment in the Air Force will have their dispositions entered in AFRISS. (Note: The
PROMIS fraud file is no longer maintained.) Enter disqualifying comments in AFRISS on
applicants who fail the DAT or receive disapproved exceptions, an unfavorable eligibility
determination (ED), or disapproved waivers for moral violations, drugs, or dependency status.
Applicants determined disqualified on initial prescreening (during interview or medical review)
will be entered into AFRISS to deter Air Force Recruiting Office (AFRO) or MEPS ―jumping‖.
Entries in AFRISS are visible command wide. There will be no changes in AFRISS to
disqualified applicant records without HQ AFRS/RSO approval.
3.29. Waiver Codes. Use table 3,4. to ensure the appropriate OSD waiver code(s) is annotated
on DD Form 1966, Record of Military Processing – Armed Forces of the United States.
Manually enter OSD waiver code(s) if it is not automatically produced by AFRISS. If there are
no OSD waiver codes required, leave both sections blank.

      MILITARY ENTRANCE PROCESSING STATION (MEPS) PROCEDURES

4.1. Overall Responsibilities. Squadron operations flight commander and flight chief are
responsible for effectively managing the AFRS liaison staff assigned to the MEPS. The MEPS
liaison supervisor (MLS) reports to the operations flight chief, who will ensure the MLS
establishes an operating instruction (OI) governing liaison NCO (LNCO) job responsibility. All
other OIs will be developed at the squadron operations flight chief‘s discretion, where needed, to
enhance management effectiveness. Air Force MEPS LNCOs will serve as the liaison between
the AFRS squadron, field recruiting force, AFRC and ANG recruiters, and USMEPCOM staff.
4.2. MLS and LNCO Responsibilities. Each MLS and LNCO will:
   4.2.1. Maintain and be knowledgeable of AFI 36-2002, AFRSI 36-2001,AFI 36-2605, DODI
   6130.03, AETCI 24-101, and all applicable PGMs and USMEPCOM regulations, including
   40-1, 601-23, and 715-4, Applicant Meals and Lodging Program. Note: The USMEPCOM
   regulations are available at http://www.mepcom.army.mil/publications/index.html.
   4.2.2. Provide timely MEPS processing orientation training to newly assigned field
   recruiters and provide documentation for training records.
   4.2.3. Provide the squadron operations flight chief and MEPS operations officer a copy of
   signed complaints regarding MEPS processing, lodging, and dining facilities.
   4.2.4. Assist ARC and ANG recruiters with applicant scheduling and processing as it applies
   to ASVAB testing, physical examinations, coordination of temporary or permanently
   disqualified applicant actions with the recruiter, distribution of high school ASVAB lists, and
   arrangement of applicant billeting.
   4.2.5. Advise the squadron operations flight chief or flight commander of issues needing
   attention by the Inter-service Recruitment Committee (IRC).
   4.2.6. Monitor transportation requests, perform audits, and certify the total count and charges
   for applicant meals and lodging (AETCI 24-101).
   4.2.7. Coordinate with the operations flight chief to determine if a Recruiter Avoidable Loss
   (RAL) has occurred. Any disqualifying factor should be considered a RAL if it prevents or
   delays an applicant‘s processing into the DEP or entry on the qualified and waiting list that,
   under normal circumstances, should have been discovered or corrected by the recruiter.
   RALs will be tracked in AFRISS.
       4.2.7.1. RALs include administrative rejections, moral or drug disqualifications, medical
       temporary disqualifications, and those who are over their Maximum Allowable Weight
       (MAW) or who failed their Body Fat Measurement (BFM). Most RALs will be reported
       during initial processing with the exception of overweight applicants, who should be
       reported when discovered. In most cases, applicants who refuse reservations will be
       counted as RALs.
       4.2.7.2. When the avoidable loss report is used for recruiter accountability, count those
       who fail to show at the MEPS (no-shows). However, commanders may grant exceptions
       to this if they determine the loss was clearly not the fault of the recruiter. When using the
96                                                         AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


     avoidable loss report for fiscal accountability, do not count no-shows unless meals,
     lodging, or transportation were involved.
     4.2.7.3. When a dispute or conflict occurs, squadron commanders will use their authority
     to determine if an RAL actually occurred. If clarification is needed for any unusual
     circumstances, they will consult group operations for assistance. When it is determined
     an RAL has occurred, MLSs or LNCOs provide the information to squadron operations
     for input into AFRISS.
  4.2.8. Establish a two-person QC check to validate applicant enlistment data and eligibility
  factors. Complete the initial QC check before processing the applicant (and prior to his/her
  travel). Complete an additional QC check at least 15 workdays prior to EAD date, using
  AFRS Form 3, AFRS 15-Day QC Checklist. Note: The operations flight chief may grant an
  exception (in writing) to the two-person QC check only when extreme circumstances exist.
  4.2.9. Review all AFRISS records prior to DEP, job reservation, and RegAF enlistment.
  Before certifying the DD Form 4 and DEP enlistment, compare information on AFRS Form
  1326, Prior Service/Reserve Data, or AFRS Form 1371, Nonprior Service Data, as
  applicable, against the applicant‘s AFRISS record and all enlistment source documents or
  certified copies of source documents.
  4.2.10. Perform a QC check on the MEPS enlistment files breakdown daily to ensure the
  distribution of enlistment records is in accordance with paragraph A16.1. USMEPCOM -
  Service Liaison Accession Package Breakdown Checklist US Air Force and USMEPCOM
  Reg 601-23.
  4.2.11. Ensure AFRS Form 1348, Case File Checklist, and copies of all enlistment forms
  and applicant documents are kept at the Air Force MEPS liaison office for 90 days after
  EAD.
  4.2.12. Ensure applicant applications are disposed of according to the Air Force RDS, Table
  36-10. Destroy applications by tearing them into pieces or shredding them to destroy record
  content.
  4.2.13. (For MLSs) Provide applicant processing instructions to assigned LNCOs to ensure
  applicants understand their enlistment options.
  4.2.14. (For LNCOs) Build an accurate applicant record in AFRISS prior to a job
  reservation, as follows:
     4.2.14.1. Validate each document to determine if any disqualifying information has been
     revealed and resolve questionable information before processing continues. This includes
     ensuring the CMO has addressed all items marked ―yes,‖ ―no,‖ or ―don‘t know,‖ as
     applicable, in items 10 through 22 of the SF 93 or ―yes‖ or ―no,‖ as applicable, in items
     10 through 28 of the DD Form 2807-1. There must be physician remarks in item 30 of the
     DD Form 2807-1 addressing these items.
     4.2.14.2. When conducting an applicant interview, print out the enlistment forms from
     AFRISS and go over them with the applicant, obtaining signatures where needed. Brief
     the applicant concerning the following items, as applicable:
         4.2.14.2.1. Special testing.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                      97


          4.2.14.2.2. The difference between the Aptitude Index (AI) and the GTEP.
          4.2.14.2.3. Enlistment bonuses and other enlistment options.
      4.2.14.3. Provide applicants with a copy of all their DEP and AD enlistment agreements
      to include their job reservation summary.
      4.2.14.4. Determine the SJC prior to a job reservation based on the applicant‘s responses
      during the interview when filling out the AFRS Form 1408. If a reservation is canceled or
      additional information is provided, review the form, reaccomplish if necessary, and
      destroy the previous form. Note: At the discretion of the MLS, an SJC may be upgraded
      due to passage of time if the current reservation has been canceled or the applicant did
      not have a reservation.
      4.2.14.5. On completion of the applicant interview, document applicant preparation,
      application discrepancies, and documents required for AD. Additionally, document in
      AFRISS any item that requires a follow-up by the recruiter. Note: In the event AFRISS
      becomes unavailable for an extended period of time, you may use AFRS Form 1349,
      MEPS Quality Control Results, to document any case file or applicant discrepancies.
   4.2.15. Process all EA class III modified flying physicals according to DODI 6130.03 and

      4.2.17.2. Is there anything you discussed with the recruiter that is not included in the
      enlistment agreement?
   4.2.18. Ensure applicants understand that no changes will be made to the enlistment
   agreement, term of enlistment (TOE), GTEP, or AI after RegAF enlistment.
   4.2.19. Should issue every new member of the DEP an AFRS Form 52, Delayed Entry
   Program Membership Card, when he or she swears into the DEP at the MEPS. When the
   card is issued, the DEP member will sign a statement of understanding that explains his or
   her responsibilities. The signed statement will be kept in the individual‘s residual file at the
   MEPS.
4.3. Enlistment in the DEP. The MLS or LNCO will:
   4.3.1. For qualified applicants entering the DEP without a job reservation, complete the
   following:
      4.3.1.1. Complete AF Form 3005, as follows:

   applicant bend his or her knees slightly and keep the back as erect as possible.
   4.21.2. Have the applicant perform an overhead press, lifting the weights as rapidly and as
   comfortably as possible and ensuring either they reach the Air Force level that is marked on
   the machine or to a full arm extension. They will not use their lower body during the press.
   4.21.3. Be sure to start at level ―G‖ (40 pounds) for all applicants. If they are able to lift this
   weight, go to the next level ―H‖ and so on. Continue the test in this manner until one of the
   following events occur: (1) the applicant elects to stop, (2) the applicant is unable to raise the
   weight to the proper level, or (3) the applicant has lifted all the weights up to the 110 pound
   maximum allowed.
   4.21.4. If the applicant at any time fails at a weight level, the previous lift level will be his or
   her
   x-factor.

      4.21.5. The following are the serial profiles for letters F through P: (Note: The letter ―F‖
      represents a failing score and is disqualifying for entry into the Air Force. The letters ―I‖ and
      ―O‖ are excluded because they may be confused with numerals.)
         4.21.5.1. F—Less than 40 pounds (failing).
         4.21.5.2. G—40 pounds.
         4.21.5.3. H—50 pounds.
         4.21.5.4. J—60 pounds.
         4.21.5.5. K—70 pounds.
         4.21.5.6. L—80 pounds.
         4.21.5.7. M—90 pounds.
         4.21.5.8. N—100 pounds.
         4.21.5.9. P—110 pounds.
      4.21.6. Once the MLS or LNCO has obtained the maximum x-factor, he or she will annotate
      AFRS Form 1408 with the appropriate letter (serial profile) F through P. Place ―x-factor__‖
      in the remarks section. Note: For MEPS who still have the medical section perform the x-
      factor and annotate it on the physical, it still must be annotated on the AFRS Form 1408.
4.22. EAD Confirmation and Accession Designation Number (ADN):
      4.22.1. EA applicants will be confirmed in AFRISS; EXCEPTION: Reserve and guard
      applicants applying for an EA program will not be confirmed in MilPDS.
      4.22.2. BOT and COT applicants will be confirmed in AFRISS. Use default ADNs when
      confirming EA applicants.

5.1. Basic Eligibility. The applicant must meet all eligibility requirements identified in this
instruction and be qualified in accordance with Table 1.1, Table 5.1, Table 5.2, and
Attachment 3. Question the applicant to determine whether he/she meets any of the conditions
in Table 1.1. If so, tactfully dismiss him/her. Refer to Chapter 4 for EEDs and waivers for
disqualifying conditions.
5.2. Substantiation of Eligibility Requirements:
     5.2.1. The burden of proof for eligibility rests with the applicant regarding his/her age, name,
     citizenship, education, dependency, and PS or reserve component status. Substantiation must
     be in the form of original documents, notarized true copies, or certified true copies by the
     issuing agency.
     5.2.2. Recruiters will refer to Table 5.1 for required documents and Table 5.2 for specific
     conditional release information. Recruiters will send copies of authenticated documents to
     squadron operations for validation. LNCOs and squadron operations will use these
     documents to verify eligibility. Make every effort to return surrendered personal documents
     to applicants when their purpose has been served. Document these efforts in AFRISS.

 NOTES:
 1. Each document must be an original or a certified true copy of the original by issuing agency. It
 must include the last period of AD and/or reserve service. If the applicant does not have required
 documents, they may be obtained from the appropriate military records center. Recruiters will
 provide applicants with SF 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, and request that applicants
 authorize the military records center to release the military records to the recruiter. (The request must
 specify the information desired; that is, an undeleted copy of DD Form 214 containing the RE code
 and separation designator, separation program number or the SPD, and a narrative reason for
 separation.) An applicant‘s Copy 4 of DD Form 214 is authorized for verification purposes. An
 undeleted DD Form 214 must accompany all requests for waivers and EDs.
 2. If reassigned to the AFRC or ARPC Nonaffiliated Reserve Section, but still in inactive ready
 reserve (IRR), status, a copy of documents may be obtained from AFPC 3. See Attachment 08 for
 instructions on obtaining PS records on applicants who have been discharged from any branch of AD
 or reserves.
 3. See Attachment 8 for instructions on obtaining PS records on applicants who have been discharged
 from any branch of AD or reserves.
 4. The state adjutant general of the appropriate state for ANG personnel must sign appropriate
 documents.
 5. All other requests should be sent to the address on the back of the SF 180.
 6. In some instances, such as reservists performing initial AD for training and members of the Coast
 Guard, a DD Form 214 is not furnished. In these cases, a statement of service from the respective
 component is required. Contact HQ AFRS/RSOPA for unusual circumstances.
 7. If the applicant‘s record contains unfavorable information that he or she disputes, the applicant
 may submit a DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record Under the Provisions of
 Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1552. (This form is prescribed in 10 U.S. Code 1552. Refer to that
 directive for guidance on filling out the form.)
 8. The applicant‘s DD Form 368 (with expiration date) or a conditional release memorandum with
 the unit commander‘s signature recommending enlistment or appointment is required. The applicant
 must have his/her MPF or sister-service equivalent verify there are ―no adverse personnel or
 disciplinary actions pending on the applicant ‖ The name, grade, title, signature, and telephone
 number of the individual validating this information will be placed on the DD Form 368 along with
 the expiration date.
 9. AF Form 526 is required only when needed to adjust the DOS or age.
 10. When requesting a statement of service, the applicant should also request the narrative reason for
 separation, primary specialty code, and grade held at time of separation. NGB Form 22 (undeleted)
 may be used to verify service for the pay and grade in which separated and the reason for separation if
 it is in a narrative form.

NOTES:
1. A commissioned officer or warrant officer must initiate a letter requesting a conditional release or
resignation through his/her reserve unit to be forwarded through the appropriate reserve channels. DD
Form 368 (with expiration date) will be used for enlisted personnel and both officer and enlisted in
any status with the Naval Reserve. The approved conditional release must be sent to HQ
AFRS/RSOC.
2. If determination is pending at the time the application is mailed to HQ AFRS/RSOC, submit a
copy of the original request and initial unit endorsement.
3. Ensure the recommendation for approval from the unit clearly states that all ADT requirements
have been satisfactorily performed.
4. Flight management will ensure a copy of AF IMT 133, DD Form 368 (with expiration date)
(bottom certification signed), oath of office (military personnel), and EAD orders are sent to the losing
agency.
5. Unit commanders (or commanding officers) may either issue the release or forward the request to
the Director, Marine Corps Reserve Support Center, 15303 Andrews Road, Kansas City MO 64147-
1207. In turn, the director may either issue the release or forward the request to the Commandant,

RULE        If the interservice reenlistment (IRE) code is         then applicant may                Notes
1           1 or 2                                                 enlist, if otherwise qualified.   1, 2
2           other than 1, 2, or ―not on file‖                      not enlist.                       1, 2, 3, 4, 5
NOTES:
1. Squadron operations will validate the IRE (a one-digit extract of the two-character RE code submitted
by the respective service) and the interservice separation code (ISC) (a direct conversion from the
separation program designator [SPD] code provided by the respective service) from DMDC and qualify
applicants according to this table. The applicant‘s RE and SPD will be verified from his or her undeleted
DD Form 214 and DMDC check. ASVAB scores and test ID on applicants will also be verified, when
available, by squadron operations and given to the LNCO. If there are any discrepancies between the
DMDC check and the applicant‘s DD Form 214, an EED must be completed by the squadron commander.
If a conflict exists in any of the previous service data verification sources, refer to Chapter 3, Table 3.3. If
an EED or waiver is required, the IRE and ISC must be included in the waiver request. Refer to Chapter 3
for waiver procedures. Applicants with ISCs of 60 through 87, inclusively, are ineligible. ISC 87 will be
considered on a case-by-case basis.
2. Applicants in an active reserve or guard component, who have never served in a regular component,
will not be on file with DMDC. These applicants do not require an EED.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                    115


 3. A waiver may be applicable for persons who have certain types of discharges (existed prior to service
 (EPTS), hardship, dependency, non-fulfillment of contract, etc.). However, a discharge must not have
 been due to punitive or administrative actions that involve defective character traits, unsuitability, or
 nonperformance of duty. Recruiting squadrons will evaluate all factors, using the whole-person concept,
 and forward applicant waiver requests to HQ AFRS/RSOP for those who are otherwise fully qualified for
 enlistment. Note: HQ AETC/SGPS-approved physical examinations are not required except for EPTS
 discharges for physical reasons other than pregnancy. Refer to Chapter 3 for waiver procedures.
 4. Previous service or PS applicants who last served in the Air Force and whose DD Form 214 shows an
 RE code of 2 (with or without suffix) is ineligible. In addition, previous service Air Force applicants with
 an RE code of 2I issued from 1982 through 1987 who gained US citizenship may request an ED for
 enlistment consideration.
 5. If the previous branch of service was not Air Force and the applicant does not have an undeleted DD
 Form 214 or 215, obtain an undeleted copy of DD Form 214 or 215. (See Table 5.1, Note 3). Be specific
 in the request. Ask for the DD Form 214 or 215, specific reason for separation, RE code, and any
 additional information needed. On receipt of the documents, verify the data with DMDC. Previous service
 Air Force applicants do not need an undeleted DD Form 214 if their separation data can be verified from
 DMDC. However, a deleted copy of DD Form 214 is still required. If the DMDC check indicated IRE 5,
 9, 0, or ―not in file,‖ incorrect information may have been provided. Validate the SSN, date of service, and
 Service branch, and then make an additional DMDC check. If the additional DMDC check remains IRE 5,
 9, or 0 or ―not in file,‖ refer to Chapter 3.
5.3. Place of Enlistment. The place of enlistment is at the MEPS through AFRS. Overseas
enlistment is not authorized except where both MEPS processing and AFRS support are
available. Send requests for exceptions through the group to HQ AFRS/RSOP.
5.4. Definitions and Processing Procedures (Previous Service, Res Res, NDT, PS, and
BSRP Applicants). See the specific procedures for processing previous service (paragraph
5.5), Res Res (paragraph 5.6), NDT (paragraph 5.7), PS (paragraph 5.8), and BSRP
(paragraph 5.9) applicants. Note: Res Res, NDT, PS, and BSRP programs will be implemented
at the discretion of AF/A1PT.
5.5. Previous Service:
   5.5.1. If active, this program applies to applicants for enlistment in the RegAF who are
   credited with less than 24 months TAFMS in the Armed Forces. (For classification and
   tracking purposes, these applicants are classified under NPS.)
   5.5.2. Individuals who have accessed to a reserve component (reserve or guard), have not
   gone to basic training or skills training, and have attended ―paid‖ training days (verified on
   the point summary). This applies to applicants who have been discharged.
   5.5.3. Individuals separated as service academy cadets or disenrolled from ROTC who were
   on ADT or received pay for reserve component drill.
   5.5.4. A reservist who‘s TAFMS consists of ADT.
   5.5.5. Individuals who have AD time, but do not meet the PS criteria.
5.6. Res Res:
   5.6.1. If active, this program applies to applicants for enlistment in the RegAF who are
   current members in active or inactive status (no pay, no drill) of the ANG or AFRC.
 116                                                         AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   Applicants in this status do not have prior RegAF active service other than for ARC training
   purposes and maintaining a qualifying AFSC.
   5.6.2. ARC members with 24 months TAFMS or more (regardless of regular or reserve
   component) are considered PS for processing purposes.
   5.6.3. Res Res applicants must meet the same eligibility requirements as NPS applicants.
   However, individuals enlisting in a previously awarded AFSC (holding 3, 5, or 7 skill-level
   AFSC status in an ARC) listed on the Prior Service Required Skills List (PSRSL) do not
   have to meet current aptitude (mechanical, administrative, general, electronic) score
   requirements.
   5.6.4. Current ASVAB AFQT score requirements must still be met. Qualified members of
   sister service reserve components who have completed an Air Force 3 skill-level basic
   technical training course for their MOS conversion AFSC within the last 2 years and
   otherwise meet the definition of a Res Res, as indicated in paragraph 5.6.3, will have an ETP
   processed through the chain of command to HQ/A1PT for a Res Res accession approval via
   AFRISS. An example of this would be an Army, Navy, or Marine Corps reserve member
   who successfully completed Air Force 3P031 Security Forces Apprentice training and is
   currently working in this skill in his/her reserve component.
5.7. NDT. If active, this program applies to an applicant for enlistment in the RegAF who has
successfully completed BMT with any branch of service, is going to attend an Air Force
technical training course, has less than 24 months of TAFMS, has been separated for less than 6
years, and is otherwise qualified for the NPS program.
5.8. PS. If active, this program applies to any applicant who has 24 months of TAFMS or more
without regard to regular component or continuous service. HQ/A1PT is the publishing authority
of the PSRSL. HQ AFRS/RSOPB will post the most current PSRSL as an attachment on the AF
Portal.
5.9. BSRP. The objective of the BSRP is to supplement the Career Airmen Reenlistment
Reservation System program by giving former RegAF first-term Airmen who have been
separated less than 12 months (from projected EAD) to reenlist without any MEPS processing.
However, accession credit will be given for reenlisting them onto AD. Application for the BSRP
may be made with any AD recruiter.
   5.9.1. An applicant for the BSRP must:
       5.9.1.1. Be a former RegAF first-term Airman who was serving in the grade of Senior
       Airman or higher at time of discharge or separation and whose break in AD does not
       exceed 12 months since discharge or separation. The 12-month period begins on the day
       following the date of discharge or separation and ends with the day of the month 12
       months later that corresponds with the date of discharge or separation. For example, for
       an applicant who was discharged on 9 December to be eligible for reenlistment under the
       BSRP, he/she must reenlist on or before 9 December of the following year.
       5.9.1.2. Be eligible for immediate reenlistment. An applicant‘s RE status code at time of
       discharge or separation may be verified from the member‘s copy of the DD Form 214
       and must be equal to RE 1J or 1R.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                   117


     5.9.1.3. Not have received disability compensation and had no change in medical status
     since discharge or separation. Note: The applicant‘s previous medical clearance for
     discharge or separation attests to the physical eligibility because less than 12 months have
     elapsed from discharge date or separation from the Air Force.
     5.9.1.4. Reenlist in the previously awarded AFSC at the 5 skill-level (3 skill-level where
     no 5 skill-level is authorized) possessed at the time of discharge or separation and that
     AFSC is on the current PSRSL.
     5.9.1.5. Have completed 36 consecutive months TAFMS on his or her first RegAF
     enlistment as a 4-year enlistee or 60 consecutive months TAFMS as a 6-year enlistee.
  5.9.2. If the applicant referenced above has joined a reserve component since discharge or
  separation, he/she must obtain a DD Form 368 (with expiration date) or a discharge from the
  reserve component to which he/she is assigned before application can be made for the BSRP.
  5.9.3. If the applicant‘s RE code is other than 1J or 1R or his/her physical or moral status
  (except minor traffic offenses) has changed since discharge or separation from AD or AFSC
  is not on the PSRSL, he/she is not eligible for the BSRP. The applicant must apply through
  the normal PS program.
  5.9.4. If any type of waiver or ETP is required, the applicant is not eligible for BSRP.
  5.9.5. Applicant requires a credit check. If an FED is required, the applicant is not eligible
  for BSRP.
  5.9.6. The recruiter will:
     5.9.6.1. Complete a personnel interview record in AFRISS, AF IMT 2030, and DD Form
     2807-2. When completing the DD Form 2807-2, use only the information since the
     separation or discharge physical.
     5.9.6.2. Advise the applicant his/her reenlistment grade under the BSRP will be the same
     grade held at time of discharge or separation from AD.
     5.9.6.3. Have the applicant list a minimum of five bases of preference.
     5.9.6.4. Have an applicant who denies any change in his/her physical, moral, or financial
     status sign and date the following statement: “This is to certify that during the period
     since my discharge or separation from the Regular Air Force, I have had no criminal
     or traffic offenses (other than minor traffic violations) or changes to my physical,
     dependency, use of illegal drugs, or financial status.” Keep the original copy of this
     statement in the recruiting office and send a copy to squadron operations.
     5.9.6.5. Send the applicant‘s AFRISS file with assignment preferences listed in the
     ―Application Remarks,‖ a copy of the applicant‘s statement denying any change in status,
     an undeleted DD Form 214, and a copy of the signed DD Form 368 (with expiration
     date), if applicable, to squadron operations.
     5.9.6.6. Squadron operations will:
         5.9.6.6.1. Validate the applicant‘s qualifications for the BSRP.
         5.9.6.6.2. Complete all AFRISS workflows establishing a record with qualifying
         physical information for the AFSC and official ASVAB scores from a MilPDS SURF
 118                                                         AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


          request or DMDC check. The information is in the first MilPDS SURF report named
          ―Enlisted/Officer Personnel Data.‖ Note: Failing to complete the AFRISS workflows
          (with a passing QC) may cause a MilPDS EAD confirmation failure.
          5.9.6.6.3. Forward the assignment request AFRS Form 1326 and applicant data or
          QC report with a copy of the applicant‘s statement denying any change in status and a
          copy of SURF MilPDS record to HQ AFRS/RSOPB and request an assignment via
          AFRISS. Once the assignment is received, send the applicant to the squadron RSSP
          representative.
          5.9.6.6.4. Confirm enlistment in AFRISS only after the applicant has sworn onto AD.
          5.9.6.6.5. Fax a copy of the enlistment orders to HQ AFRS/RSOPB on the day of
          enlistment.
       5.9.6.7. The squadron RSSP will:
          5.9.6.7.1. Verify that all requirements have been met and determine if the applicant is
          entitled to a selective reenlistment bonus (SRB). The current SRB list is located on
          the AFPC Web site (http://www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/).
          5.9.6.7.2. Complete AF IMT 901, Reenlistment Eligibility Annex to DD Form 4; DD
          Form 93; and DD Form 4, Copies 1 and 2. (AF IMT 901 is prescribed in AFI 36-
          2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force, 9 May 2011. Refer to that
          publication for guidance on filling out this IMT.)
          5.9.6.7.3. Ensure the grade in which the applicant is reenlisting is the same grade
          shown on the DD Form 214 issued at the time of his/her separation or discharge.
          5.9.6.7.4. Adjust the applicant‘s DOR based on what is shown on his/her DD Form
          214. The DOR must be adjusted by the number of days of the break in service. For
          example, if a member shows that he/she had 5 months of time in grade (TIG) prior to
          separation; subtract 5 months from the reenlistment date to determine the DOR. The
          member will not be given TIG credit for separation time.
          5.9.6.7.5. Cut orders to the gaining unit.
          5.9.6.7.6. Ensure all enlistment forms, IMTs, and statements are forwarded (or hand-
          carried) to the gaining MPF in a sealed envelope. The applicant must have his/her
          DEERS enrollment information (marriage licenses, birth certificates of children, etc.)
          upon in-processing at the gaining organization.
          5.9.6.7.7. Give squadron operations a copy of the signed DD Form 4 series,
          validating enlistment for EAD confirmation.
5.10. Age Requirements. The applicant must be less than 28 years old as of the date of entry
on AD. Compute the maximum age, using the sample at Attachment 2. Note: The Air Force has
no obligation to enlist persons who become ineligible due to the passage of time.
5.11. ASVAB Testing Requirements:
   5.11.1. PS applicants who last served in the RegAF, AFRC, or ANG may enlist, using their
   original scores if they are not applying for retraining and did not test before July 2004. All
   applicants (regardless of regular or reserve component) applying for retraining must retest
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                    119


   and meet current ASVAB AFQT and aptitude score standards. Applicants who ASVAB
   tested before July 2004 must retest on a current ASVAB version.
   5.11.2. DMDC line scores are valid for a sister-service MOS conversion (direct duty)
   reenlistment as long as the scores meet the AFRS AFQT standard. If they do not, the PS
   applicant must retest or apply for an AFRS ASVAB score waiver. As long as the PS member
   holds the AFQT and at least a 3 skill-level in an AFSC, the line scores do not have to match
   AFSC prerequisites. Note: PS members must be retested if valid scores cannot be found for
   them.
       5.11.2.1. One example is a sister-service MOS conversion to 3C031 with a G58 (G60
       required) and a 41QT. This applicant is qualified for reenlistment in that AFSC.
       5.11.2.2. Another example is an Air Force Reserve 2A153 Senior Airman with a 32 QT
       and an E57. This applicant needs to either retest for a 36+ QT or apply for an AFRS
       ASVAB waiver.
5.12. Education Requirements. Previous service, Res Res, NDT, and PS applicants must meet
current NPS high school graduate educational requirements. See Table 1.1 (Line 40) and the
information on educational credentials in Chapter 2, paragraph 2.12.5, for additional guidance.
5.13. Physical Standards:
   5.13.1. Each applicant must be physically qualified according to USMEPCOM Regulation
   40-1 and DODI 6130.03. Physicals are valid for 24 months from the date of the physical.
   5.13.2. When required, the MEPS completes a modified flying class III physical
5.14. Determining an AFSC and a Skill-Level:
   5.14.1. Use the applicant‘s latest DD Form 214, 215, or 368 (with expiration date); NGB
   Form 22; or current MilPDS SURF report to obtain the primary AFSC (PAFSC). Applicants
   who last separated from the RegAF may also be considered for enlistment in a secondary
   AFSC provided it is shown on a DD Form 214, 215, or 368 (with expiration date); NGB
   Form 22; or current MilPDS SURF report.
   5.14.2. Direct duty applicants must possess a minimum 3 or 5 skill-level in the AFSC for
   which they are enlisting unless no 5 skill-level exists in the AFSC career ladder. (This does
   not apply to those going to technical school). Direct duty applicants enlisting in pay grade E-
   6 (technical sergeant) or E-7 (master sergeant) must possess a minimum 7 skill-level in the
   AFSC for which they are enlisting. This does not apply to an applicant who has recently
   retrained.
   5.14.3. The downgrade and withdrawal of an AFSC skill level for loss of proficiency due to
   nonperformance will be according to AFI 36-2101.
   5.14.4. AFSCs awarded at the 5 skill-level held at the time of separation will be downgraded
   to the 3 skill level when individuals enlist on or after the fourth anniversary of their DOS.
   5.14.5. AFSCs awarded at the 7 or 9 skill-level will be downgraded to the 3 skill-level on or
   after the sixth anniversary of their DOS.
   5.14.6. AFSCs downgraded to the 3 skill-level under the guidance in paragraphs 5.14.4 and
   5.14.5 will be withdrawn after two additional years of nonperformance.

5.15. PS MOS of Job Code Conversion to AFSC. Sister-service (24 or more TAFMS only
unless the applicant completed either a DoD joint service technical school or an Air Force
technical school) MOS-to-AFSC conversions may be found in AFMAN 36-2108 in the
applicable career field attachment. If authorized, non-Air Force MOS or rating conversions will
be to the 3 skill-level only. Without exception, applicants with an MOS that is not listed as an
AFSC conversion in Enlisted Classification Directory found on the AFPC website https://gum-
crm.csd.disa.mil/app/home (type Enlisted Classification Directory in the search box) will be
processed for retraining.
5.16. Applicant Counseling Instructions:
   5.16.1. The recruiter will inform applicant:
       5.16.1.1. Processing does not obligate the Air Force.
       5.16.1.2. Applicant should not terminate employment or sell possessions before
       enlistment approval.
       5.16.1.3. Applicant must remain fully qualified once the assignment has been issued.
       Recruiters will give prior service applicants a copy of the most current PS applicant
       handbook once the applicant has an AFRISS reservation. Note: A copy of the handbook
       is available at the PGM website. Applicants are responsible for securing their own
       billeting arrangements.
   5.16.2. Applicants are prohibited from applying for retraining until they have completed at
   least 3 years of AD (4-year enlistee) or at least 5 years of AD (6-year enlistee).
   5.16.3. Applicants are not entitled to any special consideration for promotion, skill, or NCO
   status advancement based upon any previous military service.
5.17. Direct Duty Assignment (DDA). Applicants authorized to enlist who have an AFSC or
approved MOS conversion for which a requirement exists on the PSRSL must enlist in that skill
if otherwise qualified. See PGM website for sample order AF DDA, MOS Conversion PS Sister-
Service Enlistee (PSSSE) and DDA.
5.18. Retraining:
   5.18.1. Applicants authorized enlistment who cannot enlist in their previous skill may enlist
   for formal retraining, when available, if they are otherwise qualified. The Air Staff authorizes
   retraining and delegates responsibility to AETC. AETC then announces program availability
   through HQ AFRS to AFRS personnel.
   5.18.2. Applicants who are retraining must meet all prerequisites for the desired training and
   must be qualified on a current version of the ASVAB. Waivers for mandatory aptitude scores
   (M, A, G, and E) or physical requirements will be processed in accordance with Table 3.3,
   Rule 4.
   5.18.3. The enlistment validity period in the authorized enlistment month for formal school
   assignments is usually sufficient to permit applicants to enlist and take permissive TDY (as
   authorized) before reporting to technical training. Because early reporting is not authorized,
   applicants may either delay enlistment or request advance leave. Recruiters can access
   technical training information at Web site https://etca.randolph.af.mil. Once on the Web
   site, type the applicant‘s retraining AFSC course number (complete and exactly as it is in
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                   121


   AFRISS) in the ―Course ID‖ field as well as the course number. Then hit ―GO‖ for
   instructions.
   5.18.4. An orientation course is mandatory for all PSSSE. Members will attend this course
   prior to reporting for technical training or their permanent duty station. The PSSSE
   orientation course was developed to provide a general orientation for new enlistees to the US
   Air Force from sister services who have already completed initial entry (basic military)
   training with their service.
   5.18.5. The PSSSE course is not intended to duplicate the initial entry training that PSSSE
   students already received from their former military service or to duplicate the training
   conducted in Air Force BMT. Instead, the intent of this course is to orient PS service
   members to Air Force practices, policies, and procedures and to provide them limited initial
   medical, financial, clothing, and records processing support while they are en route to their
   first duty station or to a technical training school.
   5.18.6. The training content for the PSSSE course is developed and managed by the 737th
   Training Group, which is also responsible for BMT. PSSSE students are not intermingled
   with the BMT population for training or any other purposes. They are housed in billeting
   quarters for the duration of the course and are treated as TDY en route students—distinctly
   separate from the BMT population.
   5.18.7. The methods of instruction for this orientation course are lecture and demonstration.
   Instruction focuses on subjects specifically relevant to the US Air Force and is based on the
   contents of AFPAM 36-2241, Volume 1, Professional Development Guide (PDG) Study
   Guide. In addition to this student study guide, PSSSE students will also receive copies of the
   AFMAN 10-100, Airman‘s Manual, 24 Jun 2011, and AFPAM 36-2705, Discrimination
   and Sexual Harassment, 2 Mar 2012, for future reference. Students will be processed for
   the creation of the unit personnel record group, ID card, and emergency data card (DD Form
   93); enrollment into DEERs and SGLI systems; initial issue of Air Force uniforms; and basic
   medical, dental, and immunization. The course is unclassified. Figures A15.4 and A15.5 are
   sample orders for those attending the PSSSE course with a follow-on assignment to either
   technical training or permanent duty station.
   5.18.8. The following applies to assignment following retraining:
      5.18.8.1. When the training period is 20 weeks or more, the applicant is assigned (PCS)
      to the base where the technical training is located. Upon graduation, his/her assignment is
      based on Air Force needs. Figure A13.2 is a sample order.
      5.18.8.2. When the training period is less than 20 weeks, the applicant is given an
      assignment at the time the school assignment is obtained. Training is conducted in a TDY
      en route status unless the member is being assigned to the same base where the retraining
      technical school is located. These members cannot be considered TDY en route and will
      PCS to the gaining unit and attend the tech training course as a locally assigned member .
      Figure A13.3 is a sample order.
5.19. Assignment:
   5.19.1. Recruiters will not make any direct or implied assignment assurance, guarantee, or
   promise to the applicant.

   5.19.2. Recruiters, squadron operations, and MEPS are responsible for qualifying all
   applicants prior to requesting an assignment. Once an applicant is qualified, the MEPS load
   pertinent information in AFRISS (PULHESX, scores, assignment preferences, retraining
   AFSC preferences, etc.). Once the information is loaded, the MEPS or squadron operations
   submits an assignment request via AFRISS to HQ AFRS/RSOPB, e-mailing or faxing the
   mandatory support documents.
   5.19.3. HQ AFRS/RSOPB will then validate receipt of the documents in AFRISS,
   coordinate training and/or assignment availability with HQ AFPC, and post assignment
   instructions in AFRISS.
   5.19.4. MEPS LNCOs will refer to The PGM website for completing PS orders and Chapter
   4 for accession procedures.
5.20. Pay and Shipment of Household Goods:
   5.20.1. Once confirmed, all PS accessions will in-process through their gaining MPF
   employment and base finance sections. Members with dependents who are TDY or at their
   permanent duty station are authorized a dislocation allowance. Current allowance rates can
   be found at. http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/
   5.20.2. Once the member has in-processed the servicing MPF, it will take anywhere from 30
   to 90 days for pay records to update in MilPDS. During this period, the member may receive
   payments (manual) from the servicing finance office.
   5.20.3. The member must ensure all of his or her source documents are available to the MPF
   (DD Form 214, AF IMT 526, marriage certificate, birth certificates of children, etc.).
   Shipment of household goods, personal property, or Do-It-Yourself (DITY) moves must be
   arranged through the nearest military installation TMO. If a DITY move is not approved in
   advance by the TMO, reimbursement will not be made.
5.21. Term of Enlistment (TOE). The TOE for all PS enlistments is either 4 or 6 years.
5.22. Enlistment Documents. Refer to Table 2.6 for required enlistment documents.
5.23. Grade and DOR for PS Enlistees. Use Table A2.1 in Attachment 2 to determine the
enlistment grade. Governing directives for this information is found in AFI 36-2002 and AFI-
36-2604.
5.24. PS Enlistee DOR Determination. Use the effective date of the pay grade on the
applicant‘s DD Form 214 to determine the TIG possessed at the time of separation. Determine
the applicant‘s TIG as follows: (Note: Applicants who are entitled to enlist in a pay grade higher
than the grade they last held in the RegAF due to ARC service are not authorized to retain the
TIG accrued in the higher grade.)
   5.24.1. When enlisted before the fourth anniversary of DOS, all TIG will be restored.
   5.24.2. When enlisted on or after the fourth anniversary and before the sixth anniversary,
   one-half of the previous TIG will be restored.
   5.24.3. When enlisted on or after the sixth anniversary, the DOR will be the date of
   enlistment (DOE).

5.25. Assigning PS Personnel Directly to Recruiting Duty. The authority for assigning PS
Air Force applicants to recruiting duty is HQ AFRS/RSX. Applicants are eligible to apply if
they are otherwise qualified per this instruction. Recruiting duty is considered a DDA. The
criteria and application procedures are available through current PGMs.

           or before the physical and new supplemental documents are mailed to HQ
           AFRS/RSOPS.
6.3. BOT Selection Process: Applications are classified into two categories: active duty Air
Force members and civilian applicants. Civilian applicants include Guard, Reserve and Sister
Service members.
   6.3.1. There are primarily two program categories: ―Rated‖ and ―Non-rated‖. Rated is
   comprised of the Pilot, RPA, CSO and ABM subprograms, and the non-rated category is
   comprised of technical (which includes TDSP), and non-technical subprograms. Critical
   accession selections will be conducted as needed to meet specific needs of the Air Force.
   6.3.2. The board selection process is very competitive; therefore it is important to pay close
   attention to detail in all areas of the application. Selection numbers are based on AFRS Line
   Officer Accession requirements established by AF/A1. The Critical Accession Selection
   process is an expedited selection process and is conducted for the TDSP and other critically
   manned Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) identified by AF/A1.
6.4. Rated: Applicants can list up to four choice, Pilot, RPA, CSO, and ABM. Helicopter pilot
is not an option at the selection point for BOT, unless application is through the USAF Separated
Warrant Officer Accession Program.

HH-60G experience gap and improve overall manning which authorizes the targeted
accession of US Army Warrant Officers into the USAF.
   6.5.1. This program is only open periodically when HH60G experience inventory is
   insufficient to meet the Air Force Mission. These officers will be selected from a pool of
   qualified applicants (prior helo operators, bachelor‘s degree complete, etc.) via a boarded
   process within AFPC.
       6.5.1.1. This board is in lieu of the normal Basic Officer Training selection process;
       selected applicants will be scheduled for OTS once all other BOT eligibility criteria are
       met, to include the AFOQT.
           6.5.1.1.1. Applicants must have served at least four years as a W-2 or higher (which
           counts as commissioned time, IAW Title 10, U.S.C. §8911).
           6.5.1.1.2. Applicant must be able to complete BOT prior to 39th birthday, must be in
           good standing with their service and have completed applicable active duty service
           commitments no later than the targeted accession date.

           they are scheduled to attend OTS.
           6.5.1.2.3. Upon graduation from OTS, they will be appointed in the rank of Second
           Lieutenant in the United States Air Force and will be given the same opportunity to
           attend Air and Space Basic Course like any other OTS accession.

6.9. Procedures:
     6.9.1. Do not refuse to process tentatively qualified applicants. Based on current selection
     statistics, those who are not competitive should be discouraged from applying, but they may
     apply if they insist. Applicants may apply for BOT and enlistment concurrently.
 132                                                           AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   6.9.2. Do not submit an application more than 270 days before the applicant‘s availability
   date. EXCEPTION: Civilian applicants who are enrolled as full-time students in an
   undergraduate program may apply once they are within 365 days of graduation or
   availability.
   6.9.3. AD warrant officers, sister-service enlisted personnel, ARC members, and other
   reserve and guard members may apply for BOT. DoD policy allows members to be released
   from their previous commitment upon entry into Air Force AD. AD Air Force enlisted
   personnel apply through the base education office. Applicants in this category should be
   processed in the same manner as civilian applicants with the following exceptions:
       6.9.3.1. Military records, including promotion dates and positions held, and copies of all
       performance reports must accompany the application. Refer to paragraph 6.10.
       6.9.3.2. Before processing, a DD Form 368 (with expiration date) and MilPDS SURF
       report (where applicable) or statement of service are mandatory for all ARC and other
       reserve and guard members.
       6.9.3.3. Warrant officers and enlisted members of sister services must have a conditional
       release signed by their approval authority.
       6.9.3.4. Mandatory Interview: Any Air Force line officer with the grade of captain or
       above may conduct a personal interview with BOT applicants. Interviews conducted by a
       captain must be indorsed by a field grade officer. The interview will be face-to-face and
       in private, when possible. However, telephone interviews are permitted where geographic
       separation makes face-to-face interviews economically impractical.
          6.9.3.4.1. Active duty AF enlisted applications: unit commanders must recommend
          and conduct interview for Airmen assigned to their respective units. (AFI36-2013,
          Table 1.1, Rule 28)
          6.9.3.4.2. ANG and AFRC units commanders must recommend Airmen assigned to
          their respective units by accomplishing the application interview or providing a letter
          of recommendation. (AFI36-2013, Table 1.1, Rule 28)
6.10. Military Records:
   6.10.1. Refer to Chapter 5 for PS qualification requirements, required documentation and
   how to verify PS. Copies of these documents are required for all applicants who currently
   hold or previously held military status, and they must be included in the BOT application and
   case file.
   6.10.2. Records for AD and ARC members will be requested from their respective units.
   Civilian applicants with PS will request their records in sufficient time to have them available
   for the application to meet the prescribed cutoff date.
   6.10.3. Applicants should use SF 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to authorize
   the release of their records. Attachment 8 lists instructions for obtaining PS records with this
   form. Ensure the request asks for all military performance reports, enlistment, separation, and
   discharge documents, related correspondence, and any derogatory information (Article 15,
   UCMJ, courts-martial, etc.). Note: A current MilPDS SURF report is required on all BOT
   applications for ARC members.

          page 7.

 Figure 6.1. Mandatory Religious Practice Statement:
 ―I have been briefed and I understand: while I am on active duty, the United States Air Force
 cannot guarantee all of my personal religious practices will be accommodated. By this
 application, I voluntarily accept such potential restriction on my constitutional rights in order to
 serve in the Air Force. The Air Force‘s policy is to accommodate religious practices as long as
 the practice is determined not to have an adverse impact on military readiness, unit cohesion,
 standards, health, safety, or discipline. If my command authority determines my religious
 practice would have such an adverse impact, I agree to comply with the Air Force‘s restriction of
 my religious practice. ________ (initial)‖
          6.15.1.2. Rated applicants can be considered for up to four rated sub-programs, based on
          desires annotated on the AF IMT 56, page 7 with the following statement, under the

Figure 6.2. Rated Statement of Understanding and Choices Statement:
I understand I may list up to four rated Air Force specialties and my application will be considered for

6.16. Notification of Board Results: HQ AFRS/RSOCL will announce the board results with
two messages. One message will be sent through Recruiting Command channels by email
announcing recruiter processed selects. The second message will be sent through the Official
Personnel Services Delivery Memorandum (PSDM) process. AF/A1DL, MAJCOMS, and
Education offices will receive a courtesy copy of the PSDM message(s) announcing the board

    6.16.1. Area of Preference. Once selected, applicants are classified based on the needs of
    the Air Force, their desires and qualifications (as indicated on the AF Form 56), and the
    availability of their AFSC choices.
    6.16.2. Selection/Non-selection. All selections are tentative pending physical certification
    by the appropriate authority. A tentative class assignment will be made upon selection. The
    class assignment will become permanent once the program manager confirms the applicant is
    physically qualified by the MEPS or HQ AETC/SGSP and the required security clearance is
    scheduled for investigation for the assigned AFSC.
    6.16.3. Nonnative English Speaking (NES) Applicant Processing:
        6.16.3.1. An NES individual is anyone whose primary language spoken at home as a
        child was not English. If the interviewer indicates on Item 26 of AF Form 56 that the
        applicant does not demonstrate English speaking and/or comprehension abilities at a level
        that will allow him/her to function effectively as an Air Force officer, the interviewer
        must explain to the applicant that, if selected for a commissioning program, he/she must
        satisfactorily complete the English comprehension level (ECL) test and the Defense
        Language Institute English Language Center (DLIELC) interview.
        6.16.3.2. In addition, the interviewer must advise the applicant that failure to achieve
        qualifications within 90 days of selection notification will result in withdrawal of the
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                       139


       selection. If the briefing is applicable, the recruiter should have the applicant initial Item
       26B when signing AF Form 56.
       6.16.3.3. See Attachment 9 for procedural guidance regarding NES evaluation and
       processing actions.
   6.16.4. AD AF Selects: Refer to applicable LO PGM for post selection instructions.
   6.16.5. LO Recruiter Selects: On final selection, AFRISS will reflect several suspense‘s
   and record actions depending on the selectee‘s AFSC.

       complete commissioning physical, if not already complete; process required security
       clearances and DEP-IN actions, if eligible. Refer to applicable LO PGMs for current
       procedures.
       6.16.5.2. MTF Physicals: Applicants selected for AFSC 92XX, or 13XX must upgrade
       their MEPS physical with a flight surgeon within 90 days of selection notification. Upon
       selection, the recruiter has 15 days to get the appropriate MTF physical scheduled at the
       MTF.
          6.16.5.2.1. The 15-day suspense will be cleared once recruiter entry is made in
          AFRISS with the MTF Base, POC and phone number. Notify AFRS/RSOCL when
          entry is accomplished by email afrsots@us.af.mil to clear suspense.
          6.16.5.2.2. There will be a 90-day suspense loaded in AFRISS for completion of the
          MTF physical.
          6.16.5.2.3. Air Force Guard and Reserve: All Air Force Guard and Reserve
          selects need to complete the ―Request for Relocation Information Memorandum‖
          located in the current LO PGM. Recruiter then needs to scan and email document to
          afrsots@us.af.mil.
6.17. BOT Website: All BOT selects must regularly read the information posted on the OTS
website located at: http://www.au.af.mil/au/holmcenter/OTS/BOT/index.asp and view all
BOT videos at http://www.au.af.mil/au/holmcenter/OTS/OTSvideos.asp. This must also be
accomplished prior to the 15-day QC, and the squadron commander must brief all selects
between 5-15 days prior to their Extended Active Duty (EAD) date. Recruiters will annotate
AFRISS when the commander‘s briefing is accomplished and place the LO Accession Pre-EAD
Checklist in applicant‘s residual file.
6.18. Delayed Entry Program (DEP). Refer to paragraph 4.3 and applicable PGMs.
6.19. Acceptance Letter/Class Letter. Once notified of class assignment, recruiter needs to
process acceptance letter and return to afrsots@us.af.mil. Once all post board suspenses are
complete a class letter will be issued and sent to LO Recruiter and MEPS.
   6.19.1. Declinations. The line officer recruiter must complete current ―Declination
   Worksheet‖ from applicable LO PGM, enter declination information in AFRISS and email
   completed declination worksheet to afrsots@us.af.mil. Upon receipt of declination
   worksheet AFRS/RSOCL will initiate cancellation in AFRISS to release record to recruiter to
   close.

   6.19.2. Class Change Requests. When an applicant is unable to accept a class assignment
   due to unforeseen circumstances, he/she may request a change through the respective LO
   Recruiter to HQ AFRS/RSOCL channels. A signed letter must accompany his/her request to
   explain the circumstances and provide a new availability date. If the request is approved, the
   applicant will be reassigned and a new class letter will be provided. If the request is
   disapproved, the applicant‘s select status will be withdrawn.
6.20. Enlistment Processing:
   6.20.1. DEP management: The LO Recruiter will conduct face-to-face follow ups with
   applicants in select or commissioned status every 30 days until 30 days before EAD.
   6.20.2. EAD : Within 30 days of EAD, a follow-up (face-to-face or telephonic) must be
   completed at least every 2 weeks to include the final departure briefing. The LO Recruiter
   will complete the 5-15 day Pre-EAD Checklist to ensure applicant is still qualified. Refer to
   LO PGM for Pre-EAD checklist.
   6.20.3. BOT applicants will process through the MEPS on the EAD date provided by HQ
   AFRS/RSOCL. AFRISS will automatically populate the applicant‘s EAD as the reporting
   date. If the applicant‘s EAD is prior to the reporting date, the recruiter will coordinate with
   the MEPS, who will update the applicant‘s correct EAD date based on authorized
   transportation guidelines. Refer to paragraph 2.45 on overseas processing when MEPS
   support is not available.

6.21. Re-application:

   application prior to a board, or declined selection or class assignment may reapply if they
   wait the required time (see Table 1.1, Rule 48) from their final disposition and have

   board.
6.22. Withdrawal of Select Status:
   6.22.1. Select status may be withdrawn for applicants who:
      6.22.1.1. Were selected for rated flying duty or AFSC 13XXX and subsequently became
      medically disqualified for flying or AFSC 13XXX, but not for commissioning. These
      applicants may be reclassified into another AFSC if HQ AFRS/RSOCL determines they
      meet the needs of the Air Force (which encompasses AFRS mission and program
      requirements), applicant‘s desires and qualifications, and the availability of Air Force
      specialties.
      6.22.1.2. Were selected and then became disqualified (physically or morally) for
      commissioning. Flight commanders are responsible for notifying HQ AFRS/RSO of any
      new derogatory information after an applicant has been selected. HQ AFRS/RSO will
      evaluate each circumstance and determine disposition of applicant‘s selection status
      (reinstatement, withdrawal, reboarding for another program, etc.).

      the time of application.
      6.22.1.4. Are DEP eligible, have a class assignment more than 30 days from the date of
      the BOT class assignment letter, and do not enlist in the DEP within 30 days of class
      notification. Unique circumstances will be reviewed on an individual basis by HQ
      AFRS/RSOCL.
      6.22.1.5. Have substantiated derogatory information concerning them.
      6.22.1.6. Request a change in class date, but the change cannot be approved.

   may be withdrawn if the AFRS/CC decides the individual is unsatisfactory for a commission
   based on information in the application and in the best interest of the Air Force. The
   applicant will not meet a second board if his/her selection is withdrawn by AFRS/CC.

         RECRUITING REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS (HP)

Section 7A—HP Accessions, Basic Requirements, and Eligibility Criteria

7.1. Specialties Needed by the Air Force, Not Goaled by Annual FY Recruiting
Requirements. Overproduction requests will be submitted as ETPs.
7.2. Qualitative Applicants:
   7.2.1. Quality applicants are those who have collectively high attributes of educational,
   aptitude, physical, and moral standards. Applicants must be medically qualified or medically
   acceptable with waiver according to DoDI 6130.03. The final medical qualification authority
   is HQ AETC/SG.
   7.2.2. Recruitment of these individuals is essential to the effective operation of the Air
   Force. Meeting commissioning qualifications does not guarantee acceptance. Applicants are
   considered on a best to least qualified basis. Recruiting commanders will ensure their
   recruiters adhere to the quality concept in mission accomplishment. Additional information
   on officer accessions is in AFI 36-2005, or AFI 36-2008, Voluntary Extended Active Duty
   (EAD) for Air Reserve Commissioned Officers, 15 Oct 2009.
7.3. Education Accreditation:
   7.3.1. Unless otherwise provided in this instruction, all college and university course credits
   must have been earned from a school accredited by one of the regional or national
   accrediting commissions. Additionally, the school must be listed by the National Center for
   Education Statistics (NCES) in its Education Directory. To qualify for an NCES listing,
   schools must offer at least a 1-year program of college-level studies leading toward a degree.
   Some schools, although regionally accredited, are not listed by NCES in the Education
   Directory because they do not meet this requirement.
   7.3.2. If a school claiming regional accreditation is not listed in the current version of the
   Education Directory call the NCES to determine whether the listing is pending or the school,
   in fact, does not qualify for listing. The NCES point of contact and phone number is on page
   IV of the Education Directory.
7.4. Agreement. In all cases, the Air Force reserves the right to deny entry to active duty to
anyone, even if an agreement has been completed and that person has been given a projected
EAD date. Additionally, the Air Force may change an agreement before an applicant‘s EAD. In
these instances, applicants must be immediately notified of the change and given a choice—to
accept the change or to not EAD.
7.5. Application Submission. Submit applications only when all required documentation, to
include physical examination, is present and in accordance with the HP Annual Program
Announcement.
7.6. Basic Eligibility. Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements identified in this
instruction. Table 1.1 of this instruction (Table 2.2 of AFI 36-2005) lists conditions that make
applicants ineligible for entry into the Air Force. Unqualified applicants will be tactfully

    result in the selection being withdrawn.
    7.8. Substantiation of Eligibility Requirements:
       7.8.1. HP applicants must be able to prove they meet all eligibility requirements. Applicants
       must furnish required substantiating documents in an original, a notarized true copy, or a
       certified true copy by the issuing agency. Applicants will not be required to surrender the
       documents to recruiting personnel, but they must be counseled on the need to have these
       documents in their physical possession for any required processing actions. Recruiters must
       make every effort to return original documents. Documents submitted with an application
       will not be returned unless requested. Ensure attempts to return applicant‘s original
       documents are recorded in AFRISS.
       7.8.2. Official (final) transcripts of all college work must include the day, month, and year
       the degree was awarded. Transcripts must be embossed with the school seal (raised or
       stamped). The transcript cannot be an ―issued to student‖ transcript. For verification of
       academic course completion, the Certificate of Completion of Degree Requirements form
       letter found in the HP Annual Program Announcement is optional in place of other
       authorized documents. If provided, the Certificate of Completion of Degree Requirements
       letter must be embossed with the school seal. The recruiter will hand-carry or mail the letter
       to the appropriate school. If the letter is mailed, the recruiter must include a preaddressed
       return envelope. The form will be forwarded to HQ AFRS/RSOCA with the application.
       7.8.3. Written or telephone verification through the issuing source is required according to

     unencumbered. If verifying by telephone, complete the ―licensure verification‖ form
 146                                                           AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


       letter found in the HP Annual Program Announcement. Failure to annotate verification in
       exactly this manner will result in an application error.
       7.8.5.2. Verify qualifying degree, certificates of training (internship, residency, and
       fellowship), board certification, and ECFMG certification through the issuing source
       according to AFI 44-119, Chapter 4.
       7.8.5.3. Authenticate test scores, such as the Graduate Management Admission Test
       (GMAT), Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Medical College Admissions Test
       (MCAT), and National Dental Board scores, and any military service document furnished
       by applicant or applicant‘s unit. ―Authentication‖ is defined as evidence by a proper
       signature (by either an officer or NCO) or a seal of the issuing authority that a document
       is genuine and official. Failure to annotate authentication exactly in the following manner
       will result in an application error:
           7.8.5.3.1. Only make authentication on original source documents that have an
           original signature, official seal, and/or official school stationery. Use notary public
           service procedures when verifying copies of original source documents (when an
           AFRS officer is not available to verify). AFRS officers must use the Certificate of
           Authenticity in Attachment 12 when verifying copies against original source
           documents.
           7.8.5.3.2. Authenticating copies from copies when original documents are not
           available is not authorized. However, telephone verification from the original source
           as to authenticity (or corresponding with the original source) is acceptable. Telephone
           verification must be recorded on the front of documents and include the following
           information: individual and organization contacted, date, and AFRS representative‘s
           signature block and signature.
7.9. Interview and Qualification Restriction. To prevent wasting time and money, recruiters
will not process an application in any manner until it has been determined that the applicant has a
SSN established in his or her name and is tentatively qualified under Chapter 1 (Table 1.1),
Chapter 3, and this chapter.
7.10. Interview and Qualification Procedures. The following procedures are mandatory and
must take place before any processing begins:
   7.10.1. Inform applicants of the necessity to record their SSN and to ask specific personal
   questions about their background. Then brief them on the Privacy Act and give them an AF
   IMT 883.
   7.10.2. Once this briefing is completed, begin the interview and document it on the proper
   PIR or in AFRISS. Completing of DD Form 2807-2 and AF IMT 2030 simultaneously with
   the PIR is highly encouraged but, in rare cases, may not be practical. However, ensure these
   documents are completed before any processing actions begin.
   7.10.3. To screen applicants for any potential disqualifying factors, refer to Table 1.1 and
   Chapter 3 of this instruction in addition to Table 2.2 of AFI 36-2005.
7.11. Age, Citizenship, and Name Verification. All documents must be original, notarized
true copies, or certified true copies by the issuing agency. The burden of proof of US citizenship
rests with the applicant. See Chapter 2 and Table 7.1 for qualification standards.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                  147


  7.11.1. US Citizen: (Note: See paragraph 2.19 for additional guidance.)
     7.11.1.1. To prove US citizenship, applicants must present one of the following: a birth
     certificate or DD Form 372 validated by local or state vital statistics office; DD Form 214
     (age and name only); current, valid, unrestricted, and non-temporary US passport
     showing the holder as a US citizen; other official documents issued by a vital statistics
     office; or a court order for a name change only.
     7.11.1.2. Canadian-born American Indians are exempt from having to apply for or carry
     an INS Form I-551, but they are considered aliens for assignment and classification
     purposes. These applicants may only be considered for the EA program. Applicants born
     abroad of US parents must have a government-issued birth certificate with raised seal,
     and one parent must be a US citizen. Applicants born in the Northern Mariana Islands
     must have a government-issued ID card.
     7.11.1.3. An individual born abroad who acquired US citizenship at birth may use any of
     the following documents, issued by the specified agency, for verification:
         7.11.1.3.1. From the Department of State (DS), a valid US passport (5 years for
         minors, 10 years for adults), FS Form 240, FS Form 545, or DS Form 1350.
         7.11.1.3.2. From the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), an INS Form N-
         560A or INS Form N-561.
     7.11.1.4. An individual born abroad who derived US citizenship through the
     naturalization of his/her parents may use any of the following documents, issued by the
     specified agency, for verification:
         7.11.1.4.1. From the DS, a valid US passport (5 years for minors, 10 years for
         adults).
         7.11.1.4.2. From the INS, an INS Form N-560A or INS Form N-561.
     7.11.1.5. An individual born abroad who acquired US citizenship through his or her own
     naturalization may use any of the following documents, issued by the specified agency,
     for verification:
         7.11.1.5.1. From the DS, a valid US passport (5 years for minors, 10 years for
         adults).
         7.11.1.5.2. From the INS, an INS Form N-550 or INS Form N-570.
     7.11.1.6. Normally, US citizens will be appointed under the name that appears on their
     birth verification document. However, US citizen applicants may be commissioned with
     a preferred first and or middle name. In addition, US citizen applicants may elect a
     preferred surname if they are commonly known by that surname. Those electing to be
     commissioned with their preferred name must present their SSN card (showing their
     preferred name) to their recruiter to properly prepare the application and complete the
     NACLAC. Final acceptance of the preferred commissioning name rests with the
     recruiting officer. For those applicants who have been approved to be commissioned
     without a SSN card, their preferred name must be shown on the documents used in place
     of the SSN card.

   7.11.2. Dual Citizenship. Applicants claiming dual citizenship are not authorized to apply
   for a commission (Chapter 2, paragraph 2.21).
7.12. Verification of Previous Military Service. See paragraph 5.1 and 5.2 (and referenced
tables) to verify previous military service with the DMDC and determine required
documentation. (DMDC contains only prior regular enlistment and officer losses as well as
reserve component losses.)
7.13. Conditional Release or Resignation from Reserve Components:
   7.13.1. DD Form 368 (with expiration date) is required on any individual holding active or
   inactive (completing initial MSO) status with a reserve component of one service who is
   making an application to another service‘s regular AD component. All members requesting a
   conditional release, including commissioned officers in an ARC, should use a DD Form 368.
   7.13.2. A request for a conditional tender of resignation applies only to those officers who
   are members of a US Army reserve component. Refer to Attachment 13 for the correct
   memorandum format.
   7.13.3. The interservice transfer process will be used by any individual holding status who is
   applying to go from one service‘s reserve component to another service‘s reserve component
   or from AD in one military service to AD in another service. Refer these officers to the rules
   and directives of their parent service.
   7.13.4. The recruiter or flight management office is responsible for ensuring the applicant
   completes the appropriate request for release. A copy of the initial endorsement by the
   appropriate official in the order of the chain-of-command is requested with the application.
   Refer to paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 and Attachment 13 for conditional release determinations.
7.14. Computation of Total Federal Commissioned Service Date (TFCSD). Federal statutes
require the termination of active status of reserve officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel and
below after 28 years and 1 month of service. (See Table 7.1 for waiver information.) To
determine TFCS at retirement, the TFCSD, TAFMS date, and projected EAD date must be
known. Use paragraph 7.12 to determine TFCSD. AFI 36-2604 has additional information.
7.15. Moral Character. Qualify applicants using Table 1.1 of this instruction. HP applicants
must be of sound moral character. Generally speaking, unacceptable moral character includes an
established pattern of character and behavior disorders; defiance of rules, directives, and law; or
when an individual, who was capable of making a decision between right and wrong in conduct,
chooses to ignore generally accepted ethical standards. Refer to Chapter 3 for details regarding
moral waivers and eligibility determinations. The approval authority will maintain the original
waiver documents, and a copy of the approved waiver (AFRS Form 1415 in AFRISS) will be
sent with the selection and accession application documents.
7.16. Pre-service Marijuana and Drug Use. Officer applicants must explain pre-service

         MARKETING, ADVERTISING, AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS PROGRAMS

Section 9A—Management and Administration

9.1. Program Description. HQ AFRS Strategic Marketing Division is the marketing arm for
the entire USAF. Its ability to function and fund advertising programs is derived from a
congressional mandate. 9.0 U.S.C.-503: US Code- Section 503: Enlistment: Recruiting
Campaigns Recruiting campaigns - The Office of the Secretary of Defense shall conduct an
intensive recruiting campaign to obtain enlistment in the Regular Air Force. The Secretary of
Defense shall act on a continuing basis to enhance the effectiveness of recruitment programs of
the Department of Defense (including programs conducted jointly and programs conducted by
the separate armed forces) through an aggressive program of advertising and market research
targeted at prospective recruits for the Armed Forces and those who may influence prospective
recruits. The importance of a sustained, year-round national marketing and advertising media
campaign cannot be overstated. Our marketing efforts underwrite every aspect of our success.
At the tactical level it sponsors the most powerful lead-generating events; at the operational level
it provides web, data and lead management services, and at the strategic level it inspires young
men and women across the nation and serves as a hedge against long-term risk from changing
economic conditions which could provide other opportunities for the most competitive young
Americans.
   9.1.1. Concept. The marketing function helps Air Force recruiters meet production goals by
   generating quality leads, creating public awareness of Air Force programs and career
   opportunities, and fostering relationships with key influencers through national, grassroots
   and community outreach programs.
   9.1.2. Air Force Recruiting Service Priorities/Principles. Ensure marketing efforts reach the
   most diverse, multi-cultural prospects at the local, regional and national level. Develop and
   execute a national advertising campaign that will be inspiring to the brightest and most
   competitive Americans. How we precisely use each element at the local, regional and
   national level determines our success.
9.2. Mission:
   9.2.1. HQ AFRS/RSM is the Air Force executive agent for creating, producing, distributing
   and implementing advertising products and services necessary to support Air Force military

Section 9B—Marketing Training

9.7. Requirements:
   9.7.1. Training must instruct the recruiter where, when, how and why to use marketing tools
   to enhance production. This information must be presented in a hands-on, in-the-field
   environment. To aid in this effort, an overprint of AF IMT 623A has been developed. This
   HQ AFRS/RSM overprint (In-Zone Marketing Training - EA Recruiter) will be used to train
   new EA recruiters. Note: This overprint is available on the AFRS RST webpage under the
   AF Portal.
   9.7.2. HQ AFRS/RSM will provide continuity book guidance covering the five essential
   elements of marketing (Section 9C) to each marketing flight. Squadrons and group HP
   Flights will use this guidance to produce continuity products for their recruiters. They may
   supplement the guidance with their own material.
   9.7.3. When squadron manning dictates, the task-certified 8R000 designee, senior trainer,
   flight chief or AFRS trainer will be used to augment training.
   9.7.4. Marketing and Public Affairs Training. Occurs in the following stages:
      9.7.4.1. Recruiting School. Marketing and Public Affairs training is presented as part of
      the recruiting school curriculum and by a presentation from HQ AFRS/RSM and
      AFRS/PA to new recruiters and flight chiefs.
      9.7.4.2. Group/Squadron Introduction. When new recruiters sign in, the marketing
      team will ensure they receive a current marketing continuity product tailored to their
      zone. This product may be electronic or hard copy.
      9.7.4.3. Zone Training:
          9.7.4.3.1. This training is conducted one on one with the recruiter in his/her zone for
          at least two days, excluding travel time.
          9.7.4.3.2. Zone training will be detailed on the HQ AFRS/RSM overprint to AF IMT
          632A. Use of this IMT for demonstration training to new EA recruiters is mandatory.
164                                                          AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


         The purpose of zone training is to spend time with the recruiter in his/her recruiting
         area, not the office. Zone training integrates the five essential elements of marketing
         (Section 9C) into production objectives. Establishing relationships with key
         individuals within a zone is paramount to a successful program.
         9.7.4.3.3. A recruiter‘s key influencer contacts are, (1) members of the local news
         media who cover military and government ―stories‖; (2) community and school
         leaders, such as principals, education board members, veterans, scout groups and
         elected officials; and (3) COI vendors, such as restaurants and caterers. Zone training
         helps put the new recruiter in personal contact with as many key influencers as
         possible. (See the HQ AFRS/RSM overprint to AF IMT 623A.)
         9.7.4.3.4. Squadron marketing will bring documents that provide a marketing history
         of the zone. This history will include, organizations, POCs, phone numbers, types of
         support provided and squadron-level or higher awards presented. The assigned trainer
         (marketing NCO 8R000 or designee) will use zone history to demonstrate how to
         solicit support from the local community. At the conclusion of the new recruiter‘s
         zone training, the recruiter will file the historical data in the recruiter‘s marketing
         continuity product.
         9.7.4.3.5. Following effective demonstration-performance training, the new recruiter
         should feel comfortable performing marketing tasks in his/her zone. The recruiter
         must have built a contact base by actually meeting people. He/she must show success
         in getting promotional or civic support as a result of zone training. Follow–on training
         must be available to any recruiter identified as needing or wanting help with his or
         her zone marketing program.
         9.7.4.3.6. Additional field training may be requested at any time. Squadron
         marketing will keep abreast of recruiter general production standings and offer
         assistance via the flight chief if weak marketing activity is a possible contributing
         factor to poor production. In addition, squadron marketing will ensure additional
         training for specialty recruiters, flight chiefs and program managers that is tailored to
         the needs of their programs.
      9.7.4.4. Quarterly Flight Training Meetings. Past activities are reviewed and planning
      for upcoming activities takes place during these meetings. Marketing team personnel will
      provide recruiter training at least twice a year during quarterly training meetings or
      annual training meetings.
      9.7.4.5. AFRS Workshops. HQ AFRS/RSMU (or a designated representative) will
      provide marketing briefings and training during all AFRS-level workshops.
  9.7.5. Training Documentation. AF IMT 623A will be used to document marketing at any
  training meeting attended. Squadron-unique policies and procedures and activities that are
  not part of the five essential elements of marketing are best suited for training at these
  meetings. A copy of the AF IMT 623A generated by squadron marketing will be provided to
  the flight chief, squadron trainers, etc.
      9.7.5.1. After certification, the new recruiter will be given a signed copy of AFRS Form
      35, AFRS Certified Air Force Recruiter.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                    165


Section 9C—The Five Essentials of Marketing

9.8. Concept. To have a successful marketing program, a squadron should employ the
following five elements: recruiter-generated mail (RGM), advertising programs, COI events,
media relations, and community relations through special events participation. Personnel must
become knowledgeable of their zone to know which tools work and when to use them. The key
to the use of these five essential marketing elements is an effective training program at the
squadron level.
9.9. Element 1—Recruiter-Generated Mail (RGM):
   9.9.1. RGM will be used only to supplement a recruiter‘s need to produce Priority 1 leads
   when leads are insufficient. RGM is targeted to a person, not an address. It is a high-quality,
   first-class, direct-mail product. Flight chiefs will set monthly RGM expectations based on
   individual recruiters production needs. Mass mailings, third class mailings and trickle
   mailings (postcards) are not RGM. Recruiter-generated mail should be used sparingly and
   targeted for a particular purpose. RGM objectives are (1) to motivate the prospective
   applicant to respond and ask for more information, and (2) to reinforce the Air Force image
   as a technologically advanced professional organization.
   9.9.2. RGM may be an approved mailer or a letter, but it must include a mail-back response
   device. Groups and squadrons order nationally produced RGM mailers as needed from HQ
   AFRS/RSM. Mailers are fact folders with tearout reply cards. All RGM mailers and
   envelopes must be stamped with the recruiting office‘s return address.
   9.9.3. Squadron commanders have the authority to approve locally generated (or modified)
   EA, LO RGMs, flyers and mailers. Group commanders or their designee have the authority
   to approve locally generated HP RGMs flyers and mailers. Note: All commanders must
   ensure approved RGMs, flyers and mailers maintain the professional quality of the Air Force
   and contain accurate, grammatically correct and up-to-date information.
   9.9.4. Group and squadron commanders may approve letters and flyers for one-time use to
   advertise Air Force participation at local events, but they must give careful consideration to
   current Air Force themes and messages. Commanders should consider consulting with HQ
   AFRS/RSM. Squadrons may locally reproduce direct mail letters from HQ AFRS/RSM if the
   letters are camera-ready slicks.
   9.9.5. An RGM will not be used to respond to a request for Air Force information. An RGM
   must have only one response device (reply card), and lead tracking will occur through the Air
   Force Opportunity Center (AFOC), a civilian contractor. Altering the reply card address or
   bar code is a violation of US Postal regulations and will result in increased postal costs and
   the possible loss of AFRS mailing permits.
   9.9.6. To be effective, an RGM mailing plan must be thoroughly thought out. Before
   executing such a plan, the following issues will be considered:
       9.9.6.1. Target Audience. What is the target audience for this RGM (for example,
       students not returning to college)?
       9.9.6.2. Message. Is this the best message for this target audience (for example, an
       RGM that addresses Air Force educational benefits)?
 166                                                           AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


       9.9.6.3. Timing. Is this a good time to reach this audience with this message (for
       example, 5 or 4 weeks before the end of the quarter or semester)?
       9.9.6.4. Synchronization. Will this timing be able to take advantage of any other
       marketing activity (for example, increased awareness during radio-buy flights or in
       advance of a scheduled career day)?
       9.9.6.5. Message Saturation. Will this mailing compete with a national direct mail
       product? For example, will responses to one article make the other article appear
       ineffective?
   9.9.7. Flight Chiefs will work to ensure recruiters have sufficient RGM material to meet the
   needs of a properly applied RGM program. Planning and open communication between
   squadron training and marketing branch and flight chiefs will help ensure mailers are
   available and printing can be completed in time to meet field recruiters‘ lead-generating
   requirements.
9.10. Element 2—Advertising Programs:
   9.10.1. Overview. Effective advertising will target the recruiting message directly to
   qualified prospects and key influencers. Air Force advertising is composed of two
   campaigns—a national one and a local one. The two campaigns are integrated to enhance the
   effect of each. The national advertising campaign is developed to maintain visibility, enhance
   the Air Force‘s corporate image, and cultivate interest in the Air Force and the opportunities
   it offers via national media. In national advertising, lead-generation is a secondary mission.
   9.10.2. National Advertising Campaign:
       9.10.2.1. A national advertising plan is developed by HQ AFRS program managers, HQ
       AFRS/RSM, and a contracted civilian advertising agency. HQ AFRS/RSMA publishes
       the plan every year and provides copies to the field.
       9.10.2.2. Internet marketing is used to electronically publicize Air Force opportunities
       and benefits. It creates Air Force awareness as well as provides recruiters with leads.
       Lead information is distributed to the recruiter level through AFRISS. HQ AFRS/RSM
       maintains the electronic medium and is connected to every ad placed online via
       http://www.AIRFORCE.com and other Air Force websites. AFRS/RSM also produces
       all online advertisements (banners, links, key words, etc.).
       9.10.2.3. The objectives of AIRFORCE.COM are to provide timely information to the
       general public about service in the Air Force and to prompt users to contact a recruiter via
       a secure electronic medium. This site should maintain a positive, high-tech image of the
       Air Force. HQ AFRS/RSMA is responsible for maintaining the information displayed on
       the website.
   9.10.3. Local Advertising Campaign. The local advertising campaign takes the interest
   generated by the national campaign and promotes action by prospective applicants that
   should result in leads and increased recruiting office traffic. Coordinating and integrating the
   national and local advertising campaigns conveys a consistent, unified message and image—
   one message, many voices. It ensures the AFRS message is consistent and communicated in
   a manner expected of proper stewards of government funds.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                 167


  9.10.4. Lead Tracking. AFOC, a civilian contractor, receives leads from national and local
  advertising. These leads are transferred electronically through HQ AFRS to the recruiter.
  When training recruiters and supervisors, group and squadron marketing must be
  knowledgeable of the national lead program and must be able to explain its value and
  effectiveness.
  9.10.5. Local Advertising Budget. Based on annual advertising funding levels, HQ
  AFRS/RSM (along with HQ AFRS/FM) develops an annual local advertising budget. These
  funds, managed by HQ AFRS/RSMA, are spent through the groups and squadron‘s local
  advertising plans, which are developed by the group marketing SNCO and squadron
  training/marketing team. Funds are monitored by HQ AFRS/FM, and guidance is provided to
  groups and squadrons in an annual advertising funds policy or guidance letter.
  9.10.6. Local Advertising Management Program. HQ AFRS/RSM assigns an advertising
  account executive to handle expenditures of the local advertising plan. The account executive
  advises the squadron marketing teams and key personnel on advertising strategy. The
  account executive obtains nationally purchased advertising and serves as the liaison between
  the advertising contractor and field units.
  9.10.7. Local Advertising Plan:
     9.10.7.1. The local advertising plan will be developed to meet annual recruiting goals for
     each group and squadron. Group and squadron input and advertising analysis will be
     gathered at annual planning meetings. This information will be combined with data from
     HQ AFRS/RSMA. The contracted advertising agency will extract local advertising
     information (event marketing, in-theater advertising, newspaper, television, etc.) and
     prepare a local plan for each group and squadron. The agency will pass out these
     localized plans to each group and squadron at the annual HQ AFRS marketing
     conference. These plans will be incorporated in the local advertising plan developed by
     each group and squadron marketing teams. The group commander or designated
     representative will sign the group final plan within 30 days of receipt. The squadron
     commander or designated representative will sign the squadron‘s final plan within 30
     days of receipt. An electronic copy of the commanders approved group and squadron
     marketing plans will be forwarded to HQ AFRS/RSMA no later than 15 Nov each year.
  9.10.8. The group SNCO will provide a copy of appropriate sections of annual national and
  local advertising plans to HP flight chiefs. Squadron training and marketing team will
  provide a copy of appropriate sections of annual national and local advertising plans to EA
  flight chiefs.
     9.10.8.1. The group marketing SNCO and the squadron marketing/training team will
     conduct and document an annual review of the local advertising plan with key squadron
     personnel and send changes to HQ AFRS/RSMA. The review will determine if the local
     advertising plan is meeting the advertising needs of the group/squadrons.
     9.10.8.2. The group marketing SNCO and squadron training and marketing personnel
     will maintain a list of local media advertised in, to include POCs and phone numbers.
     They should contact these POCs when visiting news media staff as part of media
     relations activities. They should attempt to broaden this contact base to include other
 168                                                         AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


       media staff that might be influential in obtaining public service announcements (PSA)
       and news placement coverage.
   9.10.9. Group HP/Squadron Marketing Funds:
       9.10.9.1. O&M FY Funds Distribution. The initial group/squadron operations and
       maintenance (O&M) FY funds distribution may contain group/squadron advertising
       funds (PE81712) to be used for list purchases and local advertising purchases not
       available through HQ AFRS. The unit commander must ensure reconciliation is
       documented monthly on all marketing advertising funds with the unit resource advisor.
       The HQ AFRS financial management board (FMB) must approve the reprogramming or
       transfer of marketing funds (other than initial marketing) to field recruiter support
       (PE81711). The unit RA must document this transfer in the FMB minutes. Transfer
       requests must be sent through the squadron financial management section to HQ
       AFRS/RSSF. Current FY policy is provided in the field advertising funds policy or PGM.
       9.10.9.2. Spending Plans. Groups/squadrons must have spending plans in place for the
       fiscal year (fund phased by quarters). By 15 Nov of each fiscal year, group and squadrons
       must submit their initial spend plan to RSMA indicating how they plan to spend their
       local advertising funds. By 30 Jun of each fiscal year, squadrons must submit their
       spending plan to HQ AFRS/RSMA for any remaining squadron marketing funds
       (PE81712).
       9.10.9.3. Authorized       Local     Advertising    Expenditures. The       website
       http://www.Airforceads.com provides camera-ready ads. Submit written requests for
       modification and/or additions to HQ AFRS/RSMA for review and possible production.
       9.10.9.4. Other Advertising and Support Expenditures. Booth rentals and related
       services, transportation costs for tours and bands, and auditorium rental for Air Force
       bands, Tops in Blue, etc., and marketing equipment maintenance are properly charged to
       unit‘s support (PE81711).
       9.10.9.5. Prohibited Advertising. Each year, the field advertising funding policy or
       guidance letter will outline prohibited items. In no case will unprofessional platforms or
       images be used, even if there is no cost. Call HQ AFRS/RSM for a determination of
       questionable cases. Use of Air Force advertising to promote businesses is not authorized.
       9.10.9.6. Locally Produced Advertising and Sales Promotion Items. Locally
       produced advertisements of any sort, including SPIs, must present a professional image,
       contain the 1-800 number or website address, and be approved by the unit commander
       prior to purchase.
       9.10.9.7. Placing Advertisements. Only HQ AFRS/RSMA, group marketing and
       squadron marketing and training teams are authorized to place advertising for the Air
       Force. Recruiters will not place advertising in local media on their own, even if there is
       no cost. Out-of-pocket expenses or personal funds are not authorized for payment of
       advertising.
9.11. Element 3—Center of Influence (COI):
   9.11.1. General Information:
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                    169


     9.11.1.1. A COI is a planned event where meals or snacks are served to provide a setting
     for Air Force personnel to make a sales presentation. All COI events are sales
     opportunities. Whether meeting with prospective applicants or with community
     influencers, the recruiter is trying to accomplish a specific sales goal. The goal may be to
     generate an application or accession or to ―sell‖ the idea of public service support to a
     media outlet. In every case, the sales success of the COI can be measured.
     9.11.1.2. The true value of a prospective applicant COI is measured by how many people
     enter the Air Force DEP for the EA program or how many attendees apply for an officer
     AD program. Influencer events that accomplish precise objectives with noticeable results
     are effective. The person planning the COI must have a well-defined objective before
     planning and executing the COI.
     9.11.1.3. The legislative authority for sponsoring COI events is Title 37, U.S.C. 428.
     Due to the expenditure of appropriated funds involved in the COI program, public
     perception is an extremely sensitive issue. For example, if an event is perceived as
     inappropriate or distasteful, the program has caused more harm than good. Events must
     be well planned, in good taste and done in a manner that cannot be interpreted as
     extravagant.
     9.11.1.4. COI funds are exclusively for food, beverages (excluding alcoholic beverages),
     and gratuity expenses. Complimentary alcoholic beverages will not be, (or appear to be)
     accepted by AFRS personnel. COI funds will not be used to pay for such items as skate
     rental, greens fees, etc. In addition, COI funds will not be used to pay for participation in
     public or special events where admission, seating, or other accommodations and facilities
     connected with the event are restricted as to race, creed, color, sex or national origin.
     9.11.1.5. The group marketing SNCO or the squadron training/marketing team will
     follow up on COI events and offer assistance, to enhance the effectiveness of future
     events.
  9.11.2. Disposition of Leads. For tracking and refinement, enter all leads into AFRISS
  within two duty days following COI. Treat these as Priority 1 at the recruiter level. It is
  possible and practical to refine leads at actual event if time permits one-on-one interactions.
  If leads are refined at the event, they must still be entered into AFRISS for tracking or
  disposition and accountability of COI rules. The example at Attachment 15 is an effective
  tool for capturing lead information.
     9.11.2.1. The group marketing SNCO and squadron marketing/training team will inform
     their commander of ongoing COI activities
  9.11.3. Minimum Requirements. The group and squadron COI program should target
  participants in the following priority order:
     9.11.3.1. Prospective applicants.
     9.11.3.2. DEP and prospective applicant (must maintain a minimum ratio of one
     prospective applicant per DEP).
     9.11.3.3. Reinforce sale (LO and HP programs only).
     9.11.3.4. Influencer (media, civic leader, educator, etc.).
170                                                          AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


  9.11.4. Categories of COI Attendees. The classification of a COI attendee is determined
  by two factors, age and education. However, there are only two categories of COI attendees,
  a lead and a guest:
      9.11.4.1. A lead is eligible for the Air Force program being presented and was not
      generated from another lead source. Note: This would include 16-year old juniors who
      attend a COI, but an event should not be planned to target this group. In some cases, high
      school underclassmen may be comingled with seniors. In these cases, proceed with the
      COI if the majority of the class is seniors.
      9.11.4.2. A guest is not eligible for the Air Force program being presented or is currently
      at some level of the Air Force application or enlistment process (including influencers or
      media members).
  9.11.5. Unit Representatives. A unit representative may be a flight chief, Public Affairs
  representative, or certified HP recruiter, MEPS liaison, training and marketing team member,
  or any officer or recruiter at squadron, group, or AFRS headquarters. For the EA program, a
  squadron representative will attend each COI event for new recruiters and recruiters who
  have not successfully conducted a COI. For the HP program, a unit representative will attend
  each event for newly assigned specialty team recruiters. Recruiters who attend a COI while
  on TDY status must either show the government-provided meal on their travel voucher or
  decline to eat at the COI. All military and civilian employee personnel are permitted to eat at
  the COI.
  9.11.6. Sign-In Procedures:
      9.11.6.1. Group marketing SNCO or squadron training/marketing team will present
      training on how to complete COI paperwork for their perspective recruiters.
      9.11.6.2. Planning. A well executed COI event requires careful planning and
      coordination. Start planning as early as possible. Factors to be considered and a suggested
      timeline:
      9.11.6.3. Four weeks prior. Consider the audience and develop a presentation. Conduct a
      site visit of potential venues and search for appropriate vendor.
      9.11.6.4. Three weeks prior. Invite guests and solicit potential leads. Request that
      respondents RSVP.
      9.11.6.5. Two weeks prior. Review RSVPs received and negative replies and follow-up
      on invitees that have yet to respond. Complete and submit COI event request form to
      flight chief. Coordinate any special support, i.e. quest speaker, unit marketing
      representative, marketing equipment, audio/visual equipment.
      9.11.6.6. Three days prior. Validate quest and potential attendance. Confirm details with
      host venue and vendor. Review and practice the presentation.
      9.11.6.7. Day of the event. Arrive early and ensure set-up is complete. Begin on time.
  9.11.7. Steps for Requesting a COI:
      9.11.7.1. Recruiters will initiate COI event and funding requests by completing locally
      produced request forms and forwarding them to the flight chief. Flight chiefs will review
      and forward requests to appropriate group marketing SNCO or squadron
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                   171


       training/marketing team. Unit marketing personnel will verify funding availability with
       RA and prepare AFRS IMT 1406 for commander‘s approval. Upon approval, unit
       marketing will notify recruiter of approval and coordinate payment procedures.
   9.11.8. Sign-In Procedures:
       9.11.8.1. An organized sign-in procedure, using AFRS IMT 1396, COI Guest List –
       Prospective Applicant, or AFRS IMT 1397, COI Guest List - Influencer, must be
       followed for attendees at COI events. A list provided by an organization (containing
       names, addresses, and/or phone numbers) maybe used to document the sign-in of
       attendees. AFRS personnel (including those who do not eat) will sign in at all COI
       events.
       9.11.8.2. Provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 apply only in lead-generating,
       prospective-applicant events. When soliciting information subject to the Privacy Act of
       1974, the following statement must be read, given, or shown to persons signing in:
―We will be happy to provide you more information about Air Force opportunities as authorized
by Title 10 U.S.C. 503 and governing directives for Air Force Recruiting Service. The
information solicited will be used to determine eligibility and allow follow-up contact. The
routine use of this information will be for Air Force recruiting purposes only. Providing the
information is voluntary; however; failure to provide sufficient information may prevent us from
properly explaining the career opportunities available to you.‖
   9.11.9. Costs for COI Events:
       9.11.9.1. Maximum Costs. The maximum unit cost (including gratuity of no more than
       20 percent of the total bill) for COI events must not exceed the following:
           9.11.9.1.1. EA program events, $10 per person (includes AFROTC).
           9.11.9.1.2. LO and HP programs and influencer program events (including one-on-
           one events), $20 per person.
           9.11.9.1.3. Critical LO or HP specialties (as determined in writing by the unit
           commander) including one-on-one events, $40 per person. Normally, only a single
           one-on-one event is authorized per prospective applicant. The squadron commander
           may approve additional one-on-one events as needed to overcome objections or
           resolve other issues delaying the application process.
           9.11.9.1.4. When an event combines any of the cost limits listed in paragraph 9.11.9.,
           the lesser limit will be the maximum allowable. For example, EA applicants and
           faculty members would have a maximum per person of $10, not $20. In cases where
           the dollar amounts are exceeded (number of guests previously confirmed did not
           show, etc.), the unit commander or his or her designee will establish an MFR stating
           the conditions for exceeding the allowable dollar value. (The MFR will be maintained
           with the COI paperwork.)
   9.11.10. No-Shows:
       9.11.10.1. ―No-show‖ refers to a person invited to COI events that accepted the
       invitation, but did not attend (and the recruiter did not know in advance to adjust the
       number). Recruiters will negotiate COI events with vendors to obtain an agreement to not
172                                                            AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


      charge for no-shows. If a vendor will not agree to this and the recruiter believes it is still
      the best available offer, he or she will proceed with the offer. (This should be the
      exception, not the norm.)
         9.11.10.1.1. After the event, on the AFRS IMT 1396 or 1397, the recruiter will list
         the total number of persons paid for and the actual cost per person. When accounting
         for no-shows, attach a list of all individuals who accepted the invitation to the AFRS
         IMT 1396 or 1397, clearly identifying no-shows. A no-show rate of 10 percent or less
         is acceptable. If the number of no-shows paid for exceeds 10 percent of the expected
         or guaranteed attendance, explain it in an MFR prepared for unit commander‘s
         endorsement. Buffet and bulk purchase type events, such as HP residency events,
         have a floating unit cost up to the maximum unit cost. If the number of attendees
         minus the number of no-shows divided into the total cost of the event causes the unit
         cost to rise above the maximum authorized, explain it fully in the MFR prepared for
         unit commander‘s endorsement.
  9.11.11. One-on-One Events:
      9.11.11.1. A one-on-one event is an arranged meeting with one applicant and one
      recruiter. It may also include the applicant‘s spouse and the recruiter‘s spouse. Normally,
      only a single one-on-one event is authorized per authorized applicant. The unit
      commander may approve additional one-on-one events, as needed, for critical HP
      prospective applicants to overcome objections or resolve other issues delaying the
      application process. One-on-one COI events may be conducted with the following:
         9.11.11.1.1. Critical LO and HP specialty prospective applicants. A memorandum
         from the unit commander will identify these specialties based on AFRS needs at the
         beginning of the fiscal year and should be reviewed periodically during the year with
         changes made as required. With unit commander‘s approval, another military member
         may be present to help with the sales presentation; for example, an Air Force
         physician, nurse, or other person whose profession or background is related to the
         prospective applicant‘s and would further enhance the presentation.
         9.11.11.1.2. Radio and television station owners, news directors, managers, public
         service directors, program directors, or other persons in media decision-making
         positions.
         9.11.11.1.3. Civic leaders, business persons, and educators.
  9.11.12. COI Payment:
      9.11.12.1. The two methods of COI payment are:
         9.11.12.1.1. Government Purchase Card (GPC) Payment. By prior arrangement
         through the vendor, squadron marketing pays for the event using the GPC card.
         9.11.12.1.2. Government Travel Card. The recruiter pays for the event and
         forwards the itemized receipt along with all other COI paperwork to unit marketing 3
         duty days after the COI event. The Defense Travel System (DTS) will be used to seek
         reimbursement for COI event.
  9.11.13. After Action Steps for Requesting a COI. Forward all paperwork, (sign-in
  sheets, vendor itemized receipt and an after action report) for the COI to group marketing
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                       173


   SNCO or squadron training/marketing team 3 workdays of completing the COI event.
   Attachment 14 is an example of an after action report. All COI paperwork will be kept on file
   at the unit level to serve as documentation for what was purchased and what occurred. COI
   paperwork will be kept on file for three years.
   9.11.14. Following each event, squadron marketing personnel must log into AFRISS to
   make sure the recruiter loaded the leads from the event. If not, they will up channel this
   information to the flight chief for action.
   9.11.15. Analysis and Management:
       9.11.15.1. Each quarter, the COI program must be completely analyzed by unit
       marketing for effectiveness. This documented analysis, after review by the unit
       commander and production superintendent, should be sent to the flight chiefs for review
       and action.
       9.11.15.2. Unit marketing personnel will meet with the unit RA quarterly to validate and
       document the COI account balance. They will accomplish quarterly COI account fund
       phasing with the unit RA and advise flight chiefs and unit key personnel of any changes.
9.12. Element 4—Media Relations.
9.12.1. Overview. Media relations are comprised of two distinct objectives. One objective is to
promote Air Force awareness through the use of promotional or public service announcements
(PSA), proactive placement of Air Force messages, and creative awareness activities. The other
objective is to inform the public of factual and relevant Air Force information through the use of
news releases and responses to queries. Both objectives share a common goal of creating public
awareness of Air Force programs and career opportunities. Much of media relations have to do
with support gained through personal contact between recruiters and media personnel. Recruiters
will establish, maintain, and track (via AFRISS) productive media contacts with major network
affiliates, major independents, and cable outlets based on minimum requirements. The group
marketing SNCO, squadron training/marketing team and flight chiefs should periodically
accompany recruiters on media visits to ensure productive results and foster relations. See 9.40
for more information about media relations and Public Affairs.
   9.12.2. Minimum Requirements. All Enlisted Accession recruiters must visit all radio
   stations in their zones annually. Line Officers and Health Profession recruiters will visit
   radio stations at the discretion of the flight chief. All other media outlet visits will be at the
   discretion of the flight chief. Productive media visits may include the following activities:
       9.12.2.1. Introducing a new recruiter or other unit personnel.
       9.12.2.2. Offering specific promotional activity support.
       9.12.2.3. Requesting specific promotional activity support.
       9.12.2.4. Coordinating or conducting a COI.
       9.12.2.5. Soliciting specific PSA support.
       9.12.2.6. Delivering or confirming receipt of a PSA or news release.
       9.12.2.7. Soliciting or conducting an interview.
       9.12.2.8. Presenting an award, usually in connection with a COI.
174                                                           AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


  9.12.3. Public Service Announcements (PSA): Paid radio or TV requests will be referred
  to HQ AFRS/RSMA Broadcasting.
      9.12.3.1. Types of PSAs. The following two types of PSAs will be used:
      9.12.3.2. Custom Radio PSA (Spots):
         9.12.3.2.1. HQ AFRS/RSMA Broadcasting will produce custom radio PSAs and
         distribute them directly to requesting recruiters. Before ordering PSAs, recruiters will
         ensure radio stations give a verbal agreement to air the PSAs. Do not order ―generic‖
         spots; this is a personalized spot service.
         9.12.3.2.2. HQ AFRS/RSMA Broadcasting will send the recruiter one CD-ROM or
         via email, the recorded spots for each station.
      9.12.3.3. Custom Television PSAs. HQ AFRS/RSMA Broadcasting will produce and
      mail custom television PSAs by regular mail directly to requesting recruiters. PSAs will
      be completed within 3 calendar weeks and sent by regular mail. Before ordering PSAs,
      recruiters or squadron marketing personnel will ensure stations verbally agree to air the
      PSAs.
  9.12.4. Ordering Spot Announcements. There are two ways to request a spot
  announcement: by (1) faxing the request to commercial (210) 565-0707 or DSN 665-0707, or
  (2) sending an e-mail message to AFRS.Boadcasting@randolph.af.mil E-mail is the
  preferred method. Use AFRS Form 72, Localized Spot Request, to request these
  announcements. When ordering spots, provide the following information:
      9.12.4.1. Squadron.
      9.12.4.2. Grade (SSgt, TSgt, etc.).
      9.12.4.3. First and last name. Use the names as you want them on the spot. If calling in
      the request, be sure to clearly spell the name and explain how to pronounce a difficult
      name (for example, Czynicki, Villareal, Mostriani).
      9.12.4.4. Mailing address, including street address, suite number, city, state, and ZIP
      code.
      9.12.4.5. Complete commercial telephone number, including area code. Advise whether
      to use the area code in the script and if ―call collect‖ should be mentioned.
      9.12.4.6. Subject of spot. See the current PSA listing located in the PSA on the Xtranet
      9.12.4.7. Length of spot (normally 30 or 60 seconds).
      9.12.4.8. Radio station format. This is the style of music or programs aired by the radio
      station. Typical formats include rock, adult contemporary, hip-hop, news or talk, and
      contemporary hit radio (Top 40).
      9.12.4.9. Television format. Requests can support formats Beta SP, HDV or DVD.
      9.12.4.10. Call letters. For radio and TV, this means the four letters assigned to the
      station (WXYZ, KABC, etc). If the PSA is for a TV or cable station, furnish the name

9.13. Element 5—Community Relations.
   9.13.1. Overview. Community relations programs are a functional responsibility of HQ
   AFRS/RSM and HQ AFRS/PA (AFI 35-105). Community relations activities increase Air
   Force awareness at little or no expense and are limited only by the imagination of the
   recruiter. These activities include using specialized marketing equipment during community
   events such as sporting events, parades and festivals. Unit marketing personnel will help
   determine the suitability of events.
   9.13.2. Minijet and Trailer. Only AFRS personnel will tow marketing trailers. Before
   doing so, they must be trained according to the HQ AFRS/RSM AF IMT 623A overlay,
   Short-Term Marketing Training Trailer Towing.
      9.13.2.1. Logistics will coordinate all necessary maintenance for specialized marketing
      equipment and vehicles, using guidance provided by HQ AFRS/RSM in coordination
      with HQ AFRS/RSX.
      9.13.2.2. Squadron marketing personnel will schedule equipment and make the schedule
      available to everyone in the squadron.
      9.13.2.3. Maintenance of Assets.
          9.13.2.3.1. Annual safety inspections will be completed and documented on all
          assets. Proper maintenance is required to ensure safety of all AFRS personnel.
   9.13.3. Civilian Events:
      9.13.3.1. Air Force participation in civilian events builds positive Air Force awareness
      and supports recruiters in their communities. Recruiters should establish relations with
      local organizations such as tourism groups and chambers of commerce to seek out
      opportunities to showcase the Air Force within their zones. Unit marketing will review
      support requests from recruiters to ensure appropriateness of the event and will
      coordinate the logistics, support and funding required. Unit marketing will notify AFRS
      Public Affairs when the event includes high-level influencers such as mayors, elected
      officials, Chamber of Commerce members, etc.
      9.13.3.2. Groups, squadrons, flights, recruiters and specialty teams will maintain a list of
      civilian community events in their areas, indicating the events they participate in
      annually. Unit marketing, flight chiefs and recruiters will use the list to schedule
      marketing support for their respective units. Civilian events lists will contain the
      following information: the name and date of the event, name of the recruiter, POC name
      and telephone number, marketing support provided the previous year and remarks
      column.

       9.13.3.3. Review and update the list before the beginning of each FY. Recruiters will not
       commit Air Force resources until confirmed by the Air Force unit providing the support.
       AFI 35-101 contains additional information. The squadron marketing personnel will
       maintain a list of only those events the squadron will directly support. They will provide
       new recruiters with information on their zone (such as that published by the state tourism
       bureau).
       9.13.3.4. Air Force Resources. Resources for community events include bands, jump
       teams, aerial demonstration teams, color guards, drill teams, static display aircraft,
       flyovers and military working dog demonstration teams. Some units need a 9-12 month
       notice for scheduling purposes. AFI 35-110 governs the band program and AFI 35-105
       governs aerial demonstration teams. AFI 35-105, Section B outlines approval levels for
       different events. See Table 9.3. of this instruction for a quick reference to community
       events support.

      AFRS/PA, who will select primary attendees from the nominations. HQ AFRS/PA will
      distribute nomination instructions for each unit.
      9.13.3.10.4. Tour procedures are outlined in the Distinguished Educator Tour Guide
      published by HQ AFRS/PA. Following the tours, unit commanders will contact
      participants to invite them to participate in a COI event. This should take place within 30
      days after the educators return to their respective schools. The purpose of this COI is to
      allow the educator an opportunity to share with his or her peers the knowledge gained
      from tour participation.
      9.13.3.10.5. Tours of local area Air Force bases or medical facilities afford potential

products, posters and sales promotion items. As a rule, collateral materials have a five-year shelf
life. Squadrons will ensure the products in their possession are current. Minor pen-and-ink

   Industries for the Blind (NIB) database. The group Marketing NCO will distribute each
   squadron‘s and HP flight‘s allocation of SPIs via the NIB database as available. HQ
   AFRS/RSM will distribute additional SPIs in support of specific special events in the
   appropriate quantity and type. In accordance with the annual funds policy and guidance
   letter, units may use portions of their local advertising budgets to purchase locally produced
   SPIs. Unit commanders are the approval authority for these SPIs. Any modifications to the
   Air Force symbol must have the approval of AFRS/RSM.
       9.30.1.1. Sales Promotional Items are used to support the Air Force recruiting mission.
       Personnel handing out SPIs should ensure they exercise good supply discipline, just as
       they would with any other Air Force property.
       9.30.1.2. SPIs may be used to enhance recruiter efforts, to obtain referrals, promote
       prospecting by DEP members; support contacts with influencers (i.e. Counselors, family
       members, and Community mentors), news media; and promote awareness of Air Force
       opportunities.
       9.30.1.3. When considering who should receive an SPI, always consider the recruiting
       return on investment and public perception—never use SPIs in a way that would bring
       discredit to the Air Force or have the appearance of fraud, waste or abuse.
9.31. Evaluating Advertising Materials. Field feedback regarding the quality and content of
any product produced by AFRS/RSM, the advertising agency, or the NIB is encouraged and may
be accomplished in one of two ways:
   9.31.1. Recruiters should use AFRS IMT 1381, Evaluation of Recruiting Advertising
   Materials to determine the effectiveness and quality of new advertising materials (literature,
   posters, SPIs, etc.). These forms provide important feedback to HQ AFRS/RSMA on field
   reaction to or effectiveness of literature or SPIs.

   members of the National Advertising Council.

biography template.
9.36. Authority to Release Information. AFRS commanders are responsible for releasing
information within their purview. For routine matters, he or she may delegate this authority to
the UPAR. All other unit personnel will obtain guidance and clearance from the UPAR before
releasing information to the public. News releases intended for local release do not require HQ
AFRS/PA coordination unless they are also being submitted to the Defense Media Activity for
possible publication on AF.mil. However, AFRS/PA is available to assist with the coordination
of unit-level news releases.
9.37. Freedom of Information Requests. Federal statute, DoD and Air Force policy requires
prompt and accurate disclosure of information to the public. Immediately forward public
requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act through channels to the
information management section, HQ AFRS/RSI. The director and the deputy, Communications
and Information (HQ AETC/SC), are the designated denial authorities (DoD 5400.7-R/AF Sup,
DoD Freedom of Information Act Program).
9.38. Answering News Queries:

   usually delegated to the Unit Public Affairs Representatives (UPARs). Unit commanders
   must be completely aware of any news release prior to the actual release to any media. Unit
   news releases intended for local release do not require HQ AFRS/PA coordination unless
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                     185

   is from a member of the national media, contact HQ AFRS/PA for guidance.
   9.38.3. All queries from news media representatives concerning Air Force recruiting will be
   coordinated with HQ AFRS/PA. The only exception to this policy is when news media want
   an ―on-the-spot‖ interview and the questions are about the following topics: How recruiting

   Force has to offer, state of recruiting in their local area, recruiting standards, or the
   overall/local recruiting goal. Using media memo format, report all media queries and
   interviews to HQ AFRS/PA in a daily summary. Media memo format includes the name of
   the media outlet, name of the reporter, interview or query subject, interview date, brief one or
   two-line synopsis, projected publication or air date, and whether coverage is expected to be
   positive, balanced, or negative. Media memos will be forwarded to HQ AFRS/PA within 24
   hours of interview.

and HQ AFRS/CCC. When the AFRS leadership is scheduled to visit a local unit, plan media
activities to enhance recruiting activities with the prior coordination of HQ AFRS/PA. Also
coordinate with HQ AFRS/PA to determine appropriate media activity for other senior officer
visitors. Forward all press, Internet, and video clippings to HQ AFRS/PA in a daily summary
using the media memo format.

Section 9H—We Are All Recruiters (WEAR) Program:

9.40. Overview. HQ AFRS/PA oversees the WEAR program. ‖We Are All Recruiters‖
program grants active-duty Airmen permissive TDY status if they are participating in an event
that helps recruiting efforts. A WEAR event is a large event where the interaction of Air Force
personnel could potentially provide leads for recruiters. Common WEAR events include keynote
speeches at school assemblies or civic events, and direct participation in community events.
WEAR requests are submitted to HQ AFRS/PA who recommends to the AFRS/CC approval or
disapproval of events.
9.41. General Officer Visits in Support of Recruiting:
   9.41.1. Senior officers are often afforded access to schools and colleges where recruiters are
   unwelcome. The purpose of general officer visits is to leverage recruiter access to schools
   and speak with school and community leaders, students, JROTC and ROTC detachments,
   Civil Air Patrol members, youth organizations, community groups, and the media. General
   officers may also perform swear-ins for DEP members and participate in sporting events and
   other high impact awareness activities.
   9.41.2. When contacted by a general officer‘s staff, squadron commanders will appoint a
   local recruiter POC to suggest speaking venues and arrange visit details. Squadron
   commanders may also request general officer participation at school and awareness events in
   their zones. Recruiters should accompany general officers during visits and provide them
 186                                                            AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


   with such information as location, audience size, assessment of local attitudes and recruiting
   environment, and school-access challenges.
   9.41.3. Provide itineraries in advance to HQ AFRS/PA. Within two duty days following a
   visit, forward an after-action report to HQ AFRS/PA to highlight visit activities, results, and
   lessons learned. Squadron commanders will coordinate on this report.
9.42. Visits by the AETC commander or vice commander will be worked by the local
AFRS squadron commander and recruiter with a member of the HQ AFRS Commander’s
Action Group or HQ AFRS/PA.
9.43. Retirees. Air Force retirees are often civic leaders in their own right and will often
volunteer to assist recruiters by speaking to influencers in the community.

Section 9I—Social Media

9.44. Social Media Defined: Social media includes, but is not limited to, weblogs, message
boards, video sharing and other media sharing websites such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. The
AFRS social media strategy is founded on providing timely responses to recruiting related
questions, reinforcing that image that the Air Force is a high-tech service, building a strong loyal
fan base and allowing applicants to connect with and learn from active duty members. AFRS
personnel are authorized a corporate Facebook Page, and are encouraged to use this tool and
other official social networking sites for the purpose of conducting the recruiting mission. For
information on program use and individual responsibilities, see the AFRS Social Media
Handbook http://www.af.mil/socialmedia.asp.

unintentional violation of AFRS directives and could result in an individual electing a discharge
option or requiring an ETP to allow him or her to remain in the Air Force. In addition,

Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.
Home of record (HOR)—The place recorded as the home of the individual when
commissioned, reinstated, reappointed, enlisted, inducted, or ordered into the relevant tour of

National agency check/local agency check (NACLAC)—A manual process that verifies
information about a person‘s criminal history. NACs are processed through the National Crime

officers may also authenticate copies of substantiating documents by administering a sworn
statement to the applicant. (Typing ―True Copy‖ on a document with the officer‘s signature is
not permitted.) The applicant swears under oath, administered by the officer, to the authenticity
of the copied document. The certificate is at Attachment 12 and will be used to certify document
copies. It may cover more than one document but, in all cases, the copies must be attached to the
certificate. The officer does not have to see the original. The applicant is liable for making a false
sworn statement if the copies prove to be falsified.
NPS Direct Technical Training (NDT)—A program that allows former members of the Armed

 AGE, DATE OF SEPARATION (DOS), GRADE, DATE OF RANK (DOR), AND PAY
                DATE COMPUTATIONS FOR PS AND BOT

A2.1. Age Computation for PS:
   A2.1.1. When subtracted from the applicant‘s present age, his or her AD time in a regular
   component must be less than 42 and the total satisfactory years of service in ARC must
   reduce the present age to less than 28. This is a two-step computation, and both criteria must
   be met.
   A2.1.2. The applicant‘s personal copy of AF Form 526 or official MilPDS record is used to
   determine satisfactory years of service. (NGB Form 22 or DD Form 214 will not be used in
   this computation.) The bottom entry on AF Form 526 will show the total service (active and
   reserve). Satisfactory service only accrues in 1-year increments; months and days do not
   count for satisfactory service. Note: Satisfactory reserve service is determined by reducing
   the total satisfactory service on an individual‘s most recent AF Form 526 by his or her
   service in the regular component.
   A2.1.3. Compute age for PS eligibility as follows: Subtract TAFMS and total satisfactory
   reserve service from current age (at time of enlistment). (See paragraph A2.1.4.) Only ARC
   service may be used with TAFMS when computing total satisfactory service. (Note: Service
   in other reserve components is unacceptable for adjusted age computation.) For example:
                                                 Eligible        Ineligible      Ineligible
     Current age (year, month, day)               37 00 20        37 00 20        37 00 20
     Minus TAFMS (year, month, day)              -11 00 00       -04 00 00       -02 00 00
     Subtotal                                     26 00 20        33 00 20        35 00 20
     Minus total satisfactory AFRC/ANG           - 2 00 00       - 2 00 00       None
      service (from AF Form 526 only)
     Adjusted Age                                = 24 00 20      31 00 20        35 00 20
   A2.1.4. To perform subtractions, it may be necessary to convert 1 year to 12 months and 1
   month to 30 days; for example, 3 years, 2 months, and 4 days converts to 2 years, 13 months,
   and 34 days. For example:
     Current date                 2003 04 03 (YYYY MM DD)
     Converted date               2003 03 33 (Months are in 30-day increments)
     Minus date of birth        - 1966 03 13
     Equals current age           37 00 20
 208                                                            AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


A2.2. DOS Adjustment for Active ARC Service (PS). The following is an example of how to
compute an adjusted DOS for persons with active ARC service. NGB Form 22 will not be used
in this computation. (Note: This formula is used to determine the applicant‘s eligibility for
enlistment purposes.) For example:
       DOS from the regular component taken from the DD Form 214 or            1997 01 31
       215
       Plus years of satisfactory ARC service (from the AF Form 526 only)      + 03 00 00
       Equals adjusted DOS. Note: Enter this date on AETC Form 1326
       when a PS active ARC service.                                           = 2000 01 31
A2.3. Recomputing Age and DOS (PS). Both age and DOS dates must be recomputed, as
required, to ensure the applicant is eligible on the date of entry in RegAF AD. Note: Although an
applicant may be tentatively qualified when the application is initiated, the Air Force has no
obligation to enlist the applicant if his or her eligibility status changes because of time factors.
A2.4. Total Satisfactory Reserve Service. Do not round off years of reserve service; count
only full years. For example, an applicant with 11 months and 29 days of reserve service gets no
years of credit. Satisfactory reserve service is determined by reducing total satisfactory service
on an individual‘s most recent AF Form 526 or MilPDS report by his or her service in the regular
component.
A2.5. Grade and DOR (PS or BOT):
     A2.5.1. Enlistment Grade Determination. Use Table A2.1 to determine the enlistment
     grade for PS enlisted programs and PS BOT applicants.

Table A2.1. Enlistment Grade Determination for PS Enlistees.

       grade in which the applicant last separated from that component as long                   10
       as the members meets the TAFMS requirements to keep that grade. Or
       or in which he or she is currently serving in the ARC provided he/she
       meets the TAFMS requirements to keep this grade. (maximum TSgt;
       minimum SSgt—provided SSgt was held at time of separation from a
       regular component or in the ARC and the applicant meets current
       TAFMS requirements to keep the grade of SSgt)
NOTES:
1. Includes grade criteria from Table 2.1. PS members who meet the qualification for higher grade
based on Table 2.1 are entitled to that grade. For example, if a member does not meet the requirement
of 12 months of active duty to qualify for E3 on table A2.1, but he/she has completed 3 years of
JROTC, then the member meets the criteria to enlist as an E3 based on Table 2.1 Rule 9. ( Documents
presented after enlistment may not be used as a basis for changing the authorized enlistment grade
except through application to AFPC Enlisted Accessions through the members servicing MPS. 2. PS
Applicants electing 6-year enlistment options will enlist in the grade of A1C, with a DOR of the new
EAD (unless authorized a higher grade) Prior service members have already completed basic military
training and the promotion rules applicable to NPS applicants regarding 6 year enlistments are not
applicable to PS members.
3. TAFMS of over 90 days or 12 months must be verified. Use DD Form 214 or 215; AF IMT 1613,
Statement of Service (or other sister service equivalents); NGB Form 22; or AF Form 526. Pay grade
will be validated by HQ AFRS/RSOPB prior to reservation. (AF IMT 1613 is prescribed in AFI 36-
2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank, 31 Dec 2009. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling
out this IMT.)
4. If the grade of Airman or higher is not indicated on the DD Form 214, the pay grade will be
determined by HQ AFRS/RSOP prior to reservation, using a valid source document.
5. To verify service, obtain DD Form 785 from the appropriate service academy. (See Attachment 6.)
6. Adjust the date of separation (DOS) in accordance with paragraph A2.2 for satisfactory years of
ARC service (full years of satisfactory service) since separation from the regular component. Use the
adjusted DOS to determine anniversaries. See Attachment 1 for the definition of satisfactory service.
If the applicant‘s adjusted DOS is over 6 years, the applicant is ineligible for enlistment.
7. The date of rank (DOR) adjustment is computed according to paragraph A2.5.2.
8. If enlisting in the pay grade of E-4, the applicant will enlist in the grade of Senior Airman (SrA).
9. Minimum TAFMS requirements must be met for any/each of the following:
a. Enlisting in a pay grade higher than last held in the Regular Air Force (only applies if promoted in
a reserve or sister-service component to a higher grade than last held in the RegAF)
b. Retaining a pay grade earned in a regular component of a sister service
c. Retaining a pay grade last held as a member of a reserve
9.1. Two years for SrA (E-4).
9.2. Five years and 6 months for staff sergeant (E-5).
9.3. Ten years for technical sergeant (E-6).
9.4. Fifteen years for master sergeant (E-7).
10. Applicants who were former warrant officers with less than 5 years and 6 months of TAFMS will
be reduced to E-4 if they are eliminated from BOT, request and receive approval to remain on AD in
enlisted status.
210                                                         AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


  A2.5.2. DOR Computation. After authorized enlistment grade is determined in accordance
  with Table A2.1, compute the adjusted DOR. (Refer to AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and
  Dates of Rank, 31 Dec 2009.) HQ AFRS/RSOPB will determine DOR as follows:
      A2.5.2.1. PS enlistees in the following categories will receive a DOR equal to the date of
      enlistment in the RegAF:
         A2.5.2.1.1. NPS enlistees (members who have served less than 24 months TAFMS).
         A2.5.2.1.2. Former members of a regular component enlisting on or after the sixth
         anniversary of their DOS.
         A2.5.2.1.3. Reservists who enlisted in a pay grade higher than their last grade held in
         a regular component.
         A2.5.2.1.4. Reservists who never served in a regular component. A2.5.2.2. For PS
         RegAF members enlisting in the same grade and in an AFSC at the 3 skill-level or
         higher for a DDA or retraining into a designated AFSC, compute the DOR in
         accordance with Figure A2.1 and as follows:
         A2.5.2.2.1. Adjust the DOR by the number of days break in AD if break is less than
         4 years. These PS members receive credit for all time in grade (TIG) accrued prior to
         separation from regular component.
         A2.5.2.2.2. Take one-half of the member‘s previous TIG when the enlistment date is
         on or after the fourth anniversary and before the sixth anniversary of the DOS. These
         PS members receives half TIG credit accrued prior to separation from regular
         component.
         A2.5.2.2.3. The DOR equals the date of enlistment when the adjusted DOS is on or
         after the sixth anniversary of the DOS. These PS members do not receive any TIG
         credit.
      A2.5.2.3. If the member was serving in a regular component other than RegAF and
      enlists in a lower grade due to TAFMSD, DOR will be computed from the original DOR
      for the enlistment grade and years separated from DOS. For example, a PS Marine Corps
      E-5 must enlist as an E-4 due to not holding 5 years 6 months of TAFMS. He or she is
      authorized TIG credit as of the date he or she was promoted to E-4 in the Marine Corps
      based on a promotion order or official personnel document and as indicated above based
      on the amount of time separated from a regular component. Refer to Figure A2.1 for an
      example of a DOR computation.
      A2.5.2.4. If the member received a promotion in a reserve component and enlists in
      lower grade due to TAFMS and the enlistment grade was previously held in a regular
      component, the DOR will be computed from the original DOR for the enlistment grade
      and years separated from the DOS. For example, a PS Army member separated as an E-5
      and is now an E-6 in the Army reserves. The member meets TAFMS requirements to
      enlist as an E-5 (previously held in a regular component) and will retain TIG as an E-5,
      based on amount of time separated from the regular component. If the enlistment grade
      was not held in a regular component, the DOR will be equal to the DOE. Refer to Figure
      A2.1 for an example of a DOR computation.
AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012                                                                   211

 NOTE: Months are computed as 30 days. Fractions in day column are rounded up to next whole
 number.
       A2.5.2.5. Reserve members serving on EAD with the RegAF who are discharged from
       an ARC for immediate reenlistment in the RegAF will adjust the DOR as above and
       credit time served on the current EAD if they meet the TAFMS criteria for the grade in
       which they are serving. Refer to Figure A2.1 for an example of a DOR computation.
       A2.5.2.6. Former Air Force commissioned officers with reenlistment rights under Title
       10, U.S.C., 8258, will receive the same DOR they held on discharge from enlisted status
       to serve on EAD as a commissioned officer if they reenlist within 6 months after release
       from commissioned officer status.
       A2.5.2.7. Applicants who are entitled to enlist in a pay grade higher than the grade they
       last held in the RegAF due to ARC service are not authorized to retain TIG accrued in the
       higher grade.
       A2.5.2.8. The effective date of pay grade on the DD Form 214 will be used to determine
       the TIG possessed at the time of separation. Or, in cases where a sister service member
       lost a grade due to not meeting the TAFMS requirements, he or she must present their
       promotion order for the grade they held in the regular component matching their AF
       determined enlisted grade to receive TIG credit from promotion to that grade until the
       date of their DOS on the DD Form 214 (see example in paragraph A2.5.2.4).
A2.6. Pay Date (PS/BOT):
   A2.6.1. For entry in Block 18b of the DD Form 1966, Copy 1 (applicants with previous AD
   service including ADT with a reserve unit), obtain years, months, and days from the DD
   Form 214, NGB Form 22, or reserve discharge orders and compute as follows: date of
   current enlistment minus total active service equals AD service date.
   A2.6.2. To determine the pay entry date for entry in block 18c of DD Form 1966, Copy 1,
   enter the EAD for applicants with no previous active military service. For other applicants,
   enter the DOE shown on the DD Form 214, NGB Form 22, DD Form 368, statement of
   service, MilPDS report, or reserve discharge orders (when applicant was transferred to the
212                                                        AFRSI36-2001 1 AUGUST 2012


  reserves for completion of his or her military service obligation [MSO]), if the termination
  date on the DD Form 214 or NGB Form 22 has not expired before the scheduled AD
  enlistment (no break in service). Enter the DOE minus the MSO if the applicant originally

                     APPLICANT STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING


MANDATORY STATEMENT FOR APPLICANTS APPLYING CONCURRENTLY FOR A
COMMISSIONING PROGRAM AND AN ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTMENT
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE RECRUITER: Have the applicant read and sign this statement. After
completion, file the original statement in the applicant‘s PIR and include one in his or her application for
the MEPS.
I am interested in enlistment opportunities in the United States Air Force in addition to being selected for
one of the following commissioning programs: AFROTC College Scholarship Program, the Air Force
Academy, Basic Officer Training, Heath Profession Scholarship Program, Financial Assistance Program,
Medical Corps, Biomedical Science Corps, Medical Service Corps, or Joint Service Graduate Medical
Education.
Furthermore, I fully understand that:
-     I am an applicant for a program that leads to a commission as an officer in the United States Air Force.
      If I am not selected for the commissioning program to which I have applied (including the US Air
      Force Academy [USAFA] and AFROTC), I agree to enter the Air Force as an enlisted member under
      the terms of my enlistment contract.
-     My interest concerning enlistment opportunities is voluntary and enlistment is not required for
      submitting a commissioning program application. Entering the delayed entry program (DEP) will not
      increase my odds of being selected for a commissioning program.
-     The commissioning program and the Nonprior Service (NPS) DEP are separate programs that have no
      relationship to each other. Officer program applicants are under no obligation to enlist in the DEP.

-     To enlist into the DEP, I am required to take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery
      (ASVAB) test and complete a physical at the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS). However,
      I understand that these are only NPS enlistment requirements and do not apply to a commissioning
      program application.
-     If I am selected for a commissioning program, I will be released from my DEP commitment if I
      choose to accept the scholarship, appointment, or selection being offered.
-     If I enter enlisted active duty (EAD) before my commissioning program application has met selection
      board, I will not be released from my active duty commitment and my select status will be withdrawn.
      It is recommended I accept an enlistment AD date after my applicable selection board has met and
      results released.
 APPLICANT’S VERIFICATION: I have read the above information prior to entering the DEP and
understand how it applies to me. Any questions I have raised have been answered to my full satisfaction.

Applicant‘s Signature:_________________________________________                    Date: _______________
