   tech data.
      12.4.1. If a suspected unsafe explosive item is discovered by LSC, the operation will
      only be continued under EOD supervision.
   12.5. If at any time LSC determines that the hot/jammed gun or hung munitions cannot be
   safely cleared, the operation will be turned over to EOD personnel. LSC will remain in area
   and provide consultation/assistance as necessary.
