1. Overview.
     1.1. Purpose. The JCB reviews incidents of misconduct by juveniles occurring on Hanscom
     AFB and decides on a course of action. The juvenile can appeal this decision to the 66th Air
     Base Group Commander (66 ABG/CC). Participation by juveniles in the JCB process is
     voluntary. By working together, the JCB and the sponsors/juveniles help craft workable
     solutions to difficult problems. If the JCB process is incapable of resolving a problem, either
     because the misconduct is too severe or the sponsor/juvenile elects not to participate, the
     juvenile may still be prosecuted through the Federal Magistrate Court process. Also, the
     installation commander retains the authority to either bar the juvenile (and potentially the
     sponsor) from base or impose restrictions on the juvenile’s and sponsor’s privileges.
     1.2. Scope. On-base incidents of misconduct by juveniles are reviewed by the 66 ABG/CC,
     who may refer the incidents to the JCB. The JCB elects appropriate action consistent with
     the purpose of rehabilitating juveniles and correcting inappropriate behavior. As the
     appellate authority, the 66 ABG/CC is not limited to the JCB’s recommendations and may
     exercise authority in the absence of any JCB recommendation.
     1.3. Objectives. JCB objectives include the following:
        1.3.1. Maintain good order and discipline on Hanscom AFB.
        1.3.2. Help protect the well being of all personnel residing on Hanscom AFB.
        1.3.3. Standardize management of juvenile misconduct cases on Hanscom AFB.
        1.3.4. Prevent further misconduct.
2. Authority. The 66 ABG/CC shall execute this program. To maintain good order and
discipline, the 66 ABG/CC may suspend or revoke any of the base privileges of a juvenile whose
behavior is deemed inappropriate or detrimental to good order and discipline, as well as base
HANSCOMAFBI31-801 31 AUGUST 2011                                                                3


privileges of the juvenile’s sponsor (DoDD 5200.8). Among these privileges are exchange
privileges (AFJI 34-210), housing privileges (AFI 32-6001), and the privilege of entering any
part of Hanscom AFB (DoDD 5200.8).
3. Definitions.
   3.1. Sponsor. A person who is either on active duty with the United States armed forces,
   retired from such active duty, a civilian employed on Hanscom AFB, or any resident of
   Hanscom AFB (regardless of their duty status), and who is the parent, stepparent or guardian
   of a juvenile.
   3.2. Juvenile. Any unmarried person between the ages of six and 17 years.
   3.3. Misconduct. Refers to any of the following:
       3.3.1. Violations of federal law or statute.
       3.3.2. Violations of Massachusetts law or statute.
       3.3.3. Violations of local statutes or ordinances (applicable to this area).
       3.3.4. Violations of Air Force Policy Directives, Instructions, or Rules.
       3.3.5. Violations of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Policies, Instructions, or
       Rules.
       3.3.6. Violations of 66 ABG Policies, Instructions, or Rules.
       3.3.7. Any other conduct determined by the installation commander to adversely impact
       the maintenance of good order and discipline on Hanscom AFB.
4. Responsibilities.
   4.1. 66 ABG/CC. Determines which matters shall be submitted to the JCB. In the absence
   of the 66 ABG/CC, the 66 ABG/CD shall exercise the referral authority.
   4.2. 66 ABG/CD. Acts as Chairperson and presiding authority of the JCB. Calls and
   conducts JCB meetings, determines whether alleged misconduct occurred, and imposes
   corrective action (if necessary). Appoints the Case Manager via appointment memorandum.
   4.3. Case Manager. Administers the JCB program. The Case Manager’s duties include
   scheduling   meetings,    notifying    attendees,    preparing     all   correspondence,
   monitoring/managing post-JCB juvenile progress, and maintaining records.
   4.4. Members. Attend JCB meetings and provide advice to the Chairperson.
   4.5. Sponsors. Each sponsor at Hanscom AFB must ensure that his/her dependents and

6. Procedures.
     6.1. Referring matters to the JCB.
        6.1.1. The 66 ABG/CC receives information regarding alleged misconduct committed by
        a juvenile and, with the advice of 66 ABG/JA, determines whether the JCB should
        consider the case. Information may come from any reliable source (e.g., 66 SFS blotters,
        incident reports, witness statements). Although the 66 ABG/CC may receive verbal
        information of alleged misconduct, he/she should obtain written confirmation before
        referring the matter to the JCB. In the absence of the 66 ABG/CC, the 66 ABG/CD shall
        determine if a case shall be referred.
            6.1.1.1. Non-referral. The 66 ABG/CC may determine that the case is not serious
            enough to warrant referral to the JCB. The 66 ABG/CC may or may not consult with
            JCB members before making a decision on referral. In lieu of referral, the 66
            ABG/CC may issue a memorandum of warning to a juvenile and his/her sponsor.
            6.1.1.2. Referral. If the 66 ABG/CC refers the matter to the JCB, he/she notifies the
            Chairperson, who in turn notifies the Case Manager and provides case information.
            The Chairperson indicates whether additional personnel should participate in a JCB
            meeting.
        6.1.2. The Case Manager sends the sponsor an invitation (Attachment 1) to attend the
        Open Session of the JCB meeting, a fact sheet describing the JCB program (Attachment
        2), and a copy of the information that serves as the basis for the referral.
            6.1.2.1. The sponsor and juvenile must respond to the invitation within five (5) days
            of receipt stating whether they choose to participate in the JCB meeting.
            6.1.2.2. If the sponsor and juvenile choose not to participate, then the matter will be
            referred to 66 ABG/JA to determine if the case should be brought to Federal
            Magistrate Court. Additionally, the 66 ABG/CD will provide a recommendation to
            the 66 ABG/CC whether the juvenile/sponsor should be barred from the installation.
        6.1.3. The Case Manager notifies the regular JCB members of the meeting, and also
        contacts any additional members invited by the Chairperson. The Case Manager
        provides a copy of the case information to all members who will be attending the JCB
        meeting.
HANSCOMAFBI31-801 31 AUGUST 2011                                                             5


     6.1.4. The juvenile must be accompanied by his/her sponsor at JCB meetings. If either is
     absent at the time of the meeting, the Case Manager will note their absence and the
     Chairperson will decide whether the JCB will proceed with their case in their absence.
  6.2. Conducting a JCB Meeting.
     6.2.1. Meeting Time and Place. The JCB will meet on a monthly basis. The
     Chairperson may call an additional session during any month if necessary. The
     Chairperson will determine the time and place of each session. The meeting shall be
     preceded by an administrative meeting during which the Case Manager shall provide the
     progress of juveniles from previous JCB meetings.
     6.2.2. Quorum Requirements. A quorum is established with the attendance of the
     Chairperson, Legal Advisor and Case Manager.
     6.2.3. Purpose. The purpose of a JCB meeting is to assess juvenile misconduct, consider
     all available options, and take corrective action. The JCB’s goal is to rehabilitate the
     juvenile while persuading him/her to conform to standards of acceptable behavior.
     6.2.4. Nature of the Proceedings. The proceedings are non-adversarial. All “Open
     Session” discussions with the sponsor and juvenile shall, to the extent possible, remain
     informal. No transcript of JCB meetings shall be kept.
     6.2.5. JCB Sessions. A JCB meeting is not open to the public, and consists of two parts:
     the Open Session and the Closed Session.
        6.2.5.1. Open Session. The Open Session is attended by the JCB members, the
        juvenile and his/her sponsor. If the juvenile has an additional guardian, that guardian
        may also attend. If the juvenile and/or sponsor do not appear for the Open Session,
        the JCB will proceed to the Closed Session. During the Open Session, the
        Chairperson will accomplish the following:
            6.2.5.1.1. Explain to the sponsor that the JCB takes actions in response to alleged
            juvenile misconduct.
            6.2.5.1.2. Present allegations of misconduct as outlined in appropriate reports or
            other documentation.
            6.2.5.1.3. Invite the juvenile or sponsor to make a brief presentation, either to
            refute the allegation or to explain the alleged misconduct.
            6.2.5.1.4. List the actions that the JCB may take or recommend (see para 6.3.).
            JCB actions may be contingent upon the juvenile and sponsor agreeing to certain
            conditions.
        6.2.5.2. Closed Session. The Closed Session is attended by only the JCB members.
        The Closed Session may be held immediately following the Open Session or at a time
        to be determined by the Chairperson. During the Closed Session the Chairperson
        will, after considering the advice of the other JCB members, accomplish the
        following:
            6.2.5.2.1. Determine whether the juvenile committed the misconduct alleged.
            6.2.5.2.2. Determine what action should be taken, if any. If the juvenile is found

              not to have committed the alleged misconduct, the Chairperson will notify 66
              ABG/CC.
    6.3. JCB Actions. The Chairperson may take one or more corrective actions or make
    recommendations in response to juvenile misconduct.
       6.3.1. Direct Actions.
          6.3.1.1. Verbal counseling or admonishment.
          6.3.1.2. Memorandum of warning.
          6.3.1.3. Placement of certain Hanscom AFB areas or functions off-limits to the
          juvenile. This may also take the form of a curfew.
          6.3.1.4. Suspension of driving privileges.
          6.3.1.5. Referral of the matter to the Massachusetts Department of Social Services
          for action or disposition.
          6.3.1.6. Direct participation by the juvenile in a designated rehabilitation or
          counseling program. The juvenile must provide proof to the JCB of successful
          completion.
          6.3.1.7. Direct restitution by the juvenile and/or sponsor for damage to government
          or personal property within a certain time limit. The juvenile must provide proof to
          the JCB of payment within the imposed time limit.
          6.3.1.8. Direct performance by the juvenile of a designated amount and type of
          community service as a volunteer. The juvenile must provide proof to the JCB that
          the service was performed.
              6.3.1.8.1. Community service must provide benefit to a group of people, an
              organization, or the general installation, as defined by the Chairperson, with the
              advice of the Legal Advisor. The JCB may provide a list a suitable community
              service beneficiaries to the juvenile and sponsor. The service may be provided at
              more than one beneficiary. The satisfactory completion of any portion of
              community service must be recorded on an appropriate document by a
              representative of the beneficiary organization. The juvenile’s sponsor shall
              provide administrative control of the document, report progress to the Case
              Manager when queried, and submit the completed document to the Case Manager
              at the appropriate time.
              6.3.1.8.2. The juvenile’s sponsor is responsible for providing direct safety
              supervision of the juvenile when the juvenile is providing a community service.
              The sponsor may delegate direct supervision to an adult family member if duty
              requirements prevent the sponsor from providing the direct supervision. There
              are situations in which the beneficiary organization may have organic supervision
              available. With the consent of the organization, the organization may provide the
              required supervision of the juvenile.
          6.3.1.9. Direct other appropriate action.

     6.3.2. Recommendations to 66 ABG/CC. (see Attachment 4, Attachment 5 and
     Attachment 6).
         6.3.2.1. Recommendation to 66 ABG/CC for suspension or revocation of the
         juvenile’s/sponsor’s main exchange, shoppette, gas station, commissary or other base
         privileges.
         6.3.2.2. Recommendation to 66 ABG/CC for termination of the juvenile’s/sponsor's
         base housing.
         6.3.2.3. Recommendation to 66 ABG/CC for barment of the juvenile and/or sponsor
         from Hanscom AFB.
  6.4. Notification of Corrective Actions.
     6.4.1. The Case Manager, with the assistance of the Legal Advisor, prepares a
     memorandum to the sponsor, indicating the JCB actions and any conditions upon which
     the action relies (Attachment 3). The Chairperson signs the memo. If the action is
     contingent upon the sponsor and juvenile agreeing to certain conditions, the notice should
     include an indorsement signed by both the juvenile and sponsor. The conditions may not
     be negotiated.
     6.4.2. The sponsor and juvenile must return the indorsement to the JCB within five duty
     of the date of the notice.
     6.4.3. The Case Manager forwards JCB actions to the 66 ABG/CC.
  6.5. Reopening JCB cases. The Chairperson shall determine whether to reopen any JCB
  case if the Case Manager provides information that any juvenile has failed to fulfill JCB-
  directed corrective action. The purpose for reopening a JCB case is to determine whether the
  JCB should revise its response to the juvenile’s misconduct, in light of any failure to comply
  with JCP-directed action. There is no limit to the number of times a JCB case may be
  reopened.
     6.5.1. Date and Time. The Chairperson will determine the date and time to reopen the
     case. This may be at the next regularly scheduled JCB meeting or at a special meeting.
     The Chairperson notifies the Case Manager of the date and time of the meeting during
     which the case will reopen. The Case Manager then notifies the members. The Case
     Manager provides each member a copy of the information that serves as the basis for
     reopening the case. The Case Manager prepares a notice to the sponsor that the case will
     reopen, provides the date, time and location or the meeting, and invites the sponsor and
     juvenile to appear and provide comment.
     6.5.2. Conducting the meeting. The Chairperson will conduct the meeting in the same
     manner as the initial meeting as described in para 6.2.5.
     6.5.3. Notification. Following the reopened case, the JCB shall forward any revised
     actions/recommendations in the manner prescribed for normal JCB sessions. (See para
     6.4.)
     6.5.4. New Misconduct. Additional misconduct committed by a juvenile, after the JCB

fine not to exceed $500. Your shopping privileges will be automatically reinstated on ____.

4. By suspending your privileges, I desire to strongly emphasize to you that you are fully
responsible for the actions of your dependents and guests. I expect you to provide them the
