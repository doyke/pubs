                                             Chapter 1

          ENLISTED PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION SELECTION

1.1. Overview. Professional Military Education (PME) is an inherent noncommissioned officer
(NCO) responsibility. AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure, paragraph 4.1.16., states that
all NCOs must ―secure and promote professional military education for themselves and
subordinates to develop and cultivate leadership skills and military professionalism.‖ PME
completion enhances mission accomplishment by better preparing enlisted leaders to tackle
today’s Air Force demands and challenges.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities. It is the expectation of the 49th Wing (49 WG) leadership for
all 49 WG personnel to complete professional military education commensurate with their grade.
Enlisted Airmen must have a passing AF Fit Test current through the course completion to attend
resident Enlisted Professional Military Education (EPME).
     1.2.1. The Chief Leadership Course is conducted twice a year, newly promoted Chief Master
     Sergeants are required to attend one of the two courses within the first year of their
     promotion. Attendees are scheduled through the Air Staff (AF/A1DPE) at the Pentagon.
     1.2.2. The Senior NCO Academy (SNCOA) is conducted throughout the year. All Senior
     Master Sergeants must attend in residence after completing SNCO Academy by
     correspondence.    The originating office for the training allocation notification is
     Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC) who forwards quotas directly to 49th
     Force Support Squadron Personnel Systems Management Office (49 FSS/FSMPP) for the
     SNCOA about 90 days in advance of class start date who in turn forwards to 49th Force
     Support Squadron Formal Training Manager (49FSS/FSDEF).
     1.2.3. The NCO Academy (NCOA) is conducted throughout the year. The AFPC Delta
     Team schedules all students in CONUS by name to attend the NCOA. HQ AFPC screens for
     Master Sergeants who have not yet attended NCOA, eligible Technical Sergeants’ date of
     rank (DOR), and pending permanent change of station (PCS) orders. See Scheduling
     Procedures (Attachment 2). The by-name Training Line Numbers (TLNs) (NCOA allocation
     Report of Individual [RIPs]) are sent to 49 FSS/FSDE via 49 FSS/FSMPP (PSM).
     Scheduling Procedures Example is at Attachment 3. Following is selection process for
     SNCOA and NCOA:
        1.2.3.1. Formal Training Manager (FTM) receives training allocation notification for
        Holloman AFB eligibles from PSM via AFPC Delta Team normally 120 days prior to
        Class Start Date (CSD). If FTM does not receive the training allocation 120 day out,
        adjustment to the timeline will be made accordingly.
        1.2.3.2. AFPC Delta Team assigns the most eligible members as primary attendees to the
        designated class. The FTM will assign the next ten (10) most eligible members as
        alternates for the designated class. A roster containing primary and alternate attendees
        will be sent to first sergeants for use in determining next eligible alternate in the event of
        a deferment. A list of alternates can also be found on AFPC Community of Practice. For
        SNCOA, AFPC will do initial identification and assign the primary. Alternates are
        selected at base-level.
HOLLOMANAFBI36-2301 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                           3


     1.2.3.3. The Training Line Numbers (TLN) are assigned at AFPC prior to quota
     distribution. The FTM will send a Training Allocation Notification to the member, the
     Unit Training Manager (UTM), First Sergeants, and Chiefs in the case of SNCOA
     selectees.
     1.2.3.4. The FTM will send the RIP via email notification to primary and their chains of
     command with processing instructions 90 days prior to CSD for SNCOA and 120 days
     prior to CSD for NCOA. NOTE: IAW AFI 36-2301 (20 July 2010) Individuals selected
     for resident EPME will accept/decline/request deferment within 5 duty days of
     notification.
     1.2.3.5. Follow-up notification is made to the member, their UTM, First Sergeant and
     commander 10 working days after the training allocation notification is received if
     member has not responded. Notifications will be made to the member, his/her First
     Sergeant, Commander and the Wing Command Chief if there is still no response. First
     Sergeants will notify the alternates to be ready to attend class in the event there is a
     cancellation from a primary selectee.
     1.2.3.6. NCOA seat confirmation must be made 90 days prior to CSD. Otherwise,
     AFPC/DPSI notifies 49th Mission Support Group Commander (49 MSG/CC) 60 days
     prior to CSD of Holloman’s non-compliance.
     1.2.3.7. Thirty-days prior to CSD the FTM goes online to Temporary Duty (TDY)-to-
     School to ensure member’s personal information is accurate and submits a request for
     orders.
     1.2.3.8. Once orders have been processed, the FTM distributes a copy to the student, 49
     FSS/FSMPM (Force Management), 49th Comptroller Squadron (49 CPTS), and
     member’s Unit Training Manager.
     1.2.3.9. The following is a timeline for NCOA starting at 120 days prior to CSD:
        1.2.3.9.1. Day 120 Training Allocation Notification received. FTM sends primary
        and alternate roster to First Sergeants. First Sergeant notifies primary and alternate of
        selection to attend NCOA. RIPs are sent to member, UTM, and First Sergeant.
        1.2.3.9.2. Day 113 FTM sends follow-up notification to member, UTM, First
        Sergeant, and Commanders.
        1.2.3.9.3. Day106 FTM sends follow-up notification to member, UTM, First

    1.2.4. Enlisted Professional Enhancement Courses are established locally for Senior
    Airman/Staff Sergeants known as Airman Professional Enhancement Course (APEC), and
    NCOs in the rank of Technical Sergeant known as the NCO Professional Enhancement
    Course (NCOPEC). These courses bridge the gap between each level of enlisted PME and
    are considered vital to professional development of an airman. The Career Assistance
    Advisor tracks all attendees. Courses will be held throughout the year and are scheduled by
    the Professional Development Center (PDC).
    1.2.5. Airman Leadership School (ALS): Completion of resident ALS is required for SrA
    selected for SSgt before their promotion increment month. Individuals selected may not
    decline attendance. Members attending must meet, possess, or obtain the required eligibility
    and retainability as specified in AFI 36-2301 and Education & Training Course
    Announcements (ETCA) ALS Eligibility Criteria. The ALS Commandant must follow the
    seniority-based process in accordance with (IAW) AFI 36-2301 in order to ensure the right
    personnel attend to eliminate promotion withholds. Selection and scheduling for ALS
    attendance is accomplished by the local ALS and is driven by the SSgt promotion release.
       1.2.5.1. ALS Selection Process. Personnel Management Specialists (PSM) provide
       eligibility rosters as required. The ALS Commandant identifies enough students
       (primaries and alternates) to fill the production quota for a class and notifies the unit of
       potential students no later than 45 days prior to class start date. (NOTE: The 45/21 day
       notification requirement is waived for the ALS class immediately following staff sergeant
       promotion release to accommodate the immediate training of staff sergeant selects.)
       1.2.5.2. The unit will review a list of potential students.
       1.2.5.3. The unit commander will verify member’s ALS eligibility by completing a
       student eligibility checklist and return it to ALS within 10 days. An example is located at
       Attachment 7.
       1.2.5.4. If a member is deployed or TDY, a letter is all that is needed. This letter goes
       directly to the ALS Commandant.
       1.2.5.5. If a member cannot attend the specified class for reasons other than being
       deployed or TDY, the unit must process deferment request in accordance with paragraphs
       2.1 and 2.2.
       1.2.5.6. Members with a temporary physical limitation must receive a final eligibility
       determination prior to attendance. The unit first sergeant provides AF Form 422,
       Notification of Air Force Member’s Qualification Status, to ALS Commandant within 10
       days. The ALS Commandant will determine eligibility. Eligibility will be based on
       school’s ability to accommodate the medical condition and an overall assessment of
       impact to course objectives.
       1.2.5.7. The unit commander will notify member of their selection (primary or alternate)
       to attend a specific class no later than 21 days prior to class start.
       1.2.5.8. The member will acknowledge notification by signing eligibility checklist within
       5 days of receipt and return the completed notification, eligibility, and selection
       documents to ALS no later than 10 days before class begins.
       1.2.5.9. The following is a timeline for ALS starting at 45 days prior to CSD:
HOLLOMANAFBI36-2301 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         5


       1.2.5.9.1. Day 45 Unit receives list from ALS Commandant and verifies eligibility of
       attendees.
       1.2.5.9.2. Day 35 Eligibility checklist is returned or deferment letter if student can’t
       attend.
       1.2.5.9.3. Day 21 Students are notified of selection.

                                  DEFERMENT PROCESS

2.1. Types of Deferments. Deferments are categorized into 3 general types:
     2.1.1. Mission: The individual scheduled to attend PME is indispensable to the mission; in
     short the mission will absolutely fail without his/her presence. Individual is deployed or
     scheduled for deployment.
     2.1.2. Medical: The individual scheduled to attend PME is on a medical profile that would
     prevent them from meeting requirements of PME signed by a competent medical authority.
     The medical deferment will include AF Form 422 (see example at Attachment 4) and AF
     Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report. (Note: There is a special process for medical
     deferments for SNCOA/NCOA. AF Form 422 and AF Form 469 must be sent to the school
     house. They will make the final determination if a student can attend.)
     2.1.3. Humanitarian: The individual scheduled to attend PME experiences an unusual
     stressful family or personal situation or emergency situation with an immediate family
     member as defined under humanitarian reassignment criteria in accordance with AFI 36-
     2110, Assignments.
2.2. The approval authority for all deferments is the 49 WG/CC (or Senior Rater) for all
level of EPME. SNCOA and CONUS NCOA Deferment Checklist is at Attachment 5.
     2.2.1. Chief Leadership Course: The deferment process mirrors the NCOA/SNCOA
     process except letter is sent to HQ ACC and then to AF/A1DPE.
     2.2.2. NCOA/SNCOA: If a deferment is approved, the FTM will refer to the eligibility
     roster from the AFPC approved alternate list for a replacement name to submit to
     AFPC/DPSIT Delta Team along with the approved deferment letter. The formal deferment
     letter (Attachment 6) must be adhered to. (NOTE: For SNCOA, if prior to 2-weeks before
     class start date, the FTM will send AFPC/DPSIT Delta Team a replacement name for
     approved deferments. If it is less than 2 weeks prior class start date, AFPC/DPSIT Delta
     Team will select an alternate from the AF-wide approved list.)
     2.2.3. ALS: Members selected for ALS may be deferred for compelling non-routine
     mission, humanitarian, medical, or other reasons without prejudice upon approval of the
     Wing Commander. Deferment requests will be kept to the absolute minimum and require
     solid justification. Example ALS Deferment Letter is at Attachment 8.
        2.2.3.1. Unit will process all deferment requests through their respective group via unit
        commanders to the ALS Commandant for coordination NLT 35 days prior to class start
        date. ALS Commandant will consolidate all inputs for the Wing Command Chief
        coordination/concurrence and forwarding to Wing Commander for approval/disapproval.

     2.2.3.2. ALS Commandant will notify units of the final outcome of the deferments (i.e.
     approve or disapproved). The ALS will file approved deferments for a matter of record.

The above is an example of the process, those items that we can see in system, we can work
around. In this case the second most eligible member TSgt Ray was by-passed due to an
approved retirement. TSgt Garcia was assigned a later class date due to the fact that he was
deployed and unavailable for the first class. TSgt Fish, who is also deployed will be assigned a
class date after his arrival from deployment. The Alternates for the classes, if not used to
backfill a primary, are also automatically the most eligible for the next class. (see
HOLLOMANAFBI36-2301, para 1.2.3.1. - 1.2.3.9. for further guidance).
