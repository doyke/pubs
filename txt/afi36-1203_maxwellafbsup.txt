AFI 36-1203, 1 May 1996, is supplemented as follows:

This supplement implements AFI 36-1203, Administrative Grievance System. It establishes and
defines the Administrative Grievance process at Maxwell-Gunter AFB. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) (available at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/). This supplement
applies to all civilian personnel serviced by the 42d Mission Support Squadron Civilian
Personnel Flight.

7.1. (MAXWELL) Each employee is entitled to a reasonable amount of official time for
grievance preparation. The standard is up to 4 hours per grievance and a request for use of
official time must be submitted in advance to the employee’s immediate supervisor for approval.

10. Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) is encouraged at any stage of the grievance process. If
ADR is requested and agreed to by all parties, the matter/grievance will be held in abeyance until
completion of the ADR process. The grievant/employee will then have 15 calendar days to
continue the grievance process if resolution could not be attained.

11.2.1. (MAXWELL) All formal grievances will be filed with 42d Mission Support Squadron,
Civilian Personnel Flight, (42 MSS/DPC), Attention:                      Labor Relations Officer,
50 LeMay Plaza South, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6334. After initial review, the Labor Relations
Officer will forward the formal grievance to the appropriate deciding official in the employee’s
chain of command. The deciding official will make the written decision on the grievance which
will constitute the final decision unless the grievant files a request for review.
              DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE

11.6.1. (MAXWELL) If the deciding official refers the grievance to the DoD Office of
Complaint Investigations for an impartial investigation, the requesting organization is obligated
to provide any required funding.

11.7.1. (MAXWELL) Normally the deciding official’s decision is final. However, most
requests for review by the grievant will be decided by the next higher organization’s commander.
This will be the final decision. Actions involving suspensions for more than 14 days, removals,
and reduction in grade or pay will be forwarded to the Air Force Civilian Appellate Review
Office (AFCARO) for a decision.
