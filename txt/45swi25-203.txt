Job Order Manager (JOM)—The 45 SW employee who is assigned to manage the use of
45 SW funds to fulfill customer requirements and request requirements and funding from the
customer to 45 SW for their specific Job Order Number. JOM(s) update ACES with new
RC/CC(s) for cost estimates and ensure cost estimates are completed and reviewed by the
45th Comptroller Squadron (45 CPTS).
Job Order Number (JON)—An eight digit alpha-numeric code issued by 45 SW to track
reimbursable costs to be billed to tenant activities, range customers and deployments to 45 SW.
JONs are also used by 45 SW to track selected institutional (nonreimbursable) costs by program.
Joint Operating Procedures (JOP)—JOPs are documents used to supplement agreements to
define procedures and responsibilities that are too detailed for inclusion in the agreement. JOPs
are consummated at the lowest practical operating level to ensure specific knowledge of the
circumstances is applied. The 45 SWI 25-201, Joint Operating Procedures, defines the policies,
rules and procedures relative to JOPs.
Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB)—The designated core set of DoD Test and
Evaluation (T&E) infrastructure and associated workforce that must be preserved as a national
asset to provide T&E capabilities to support the DoD acquisition system.
Manpower Annex—A part of the support agreement used to document the manpower impact.
The supplier’s Manpower and Organization Flight prepares this annex.
Manpower Impact—The measured change in a work center's manpower requirement resulting
from the implementation of a support agreement.
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)—Memorandums that define general areas of conditional
agreement between two or more parties where what one party does depends on what the other
party does (e.g., one party agrees to provide support if the other party provides the materials).
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)—Memorandums that define general areas of
understanding between two or more parties which explain what each party plans to do; however,
what each party does is not dependent on what the other party does (e.g., does not require
reimbursement or other support from receiver).
Range Support (RS)—Documented in the Universal Documentation System (UDS) and/or in
45 SW Mission Agreements, e.g., Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs), Memorandums of
Understanding (MOUs) and Commercial Space Operations Support Agreements (CSOSAs).
AFI 25-201 recommends using the DD Form 1144 Support Agreement for BOS provided to
range customers in addition to the specialized range documentation provided IAW DoDD
3200.11.
Range Users—Customers of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station such as the Department of
Defense, non-Department of Defense US government agencies, civilian commercial companies,
and foreign government agencies that use Eastern Range facilities and test equipment; conduct
prelaunch, launch and impact operations; or require on-orbit support.
Receiver—An activity, normally a tenant or geographically separated unit which receives
recurring BOS governed by AFI 25-201 and/or DoDI 4000.19.
Recurring—Recurring support in reference to formal support agreements documented on a DD
Form 1144 is support that continues for a minimum of one year.

organization.
Services—Includes services rendered such as communications, utilities, maintenance of
facilities, and other functions performed for the tenant by the host. Excludes supplies and
materials issued directly to the tenant to perform the tenant's mission.
Significant Change (in support requirements)—A change in the amount, level or frequency of
requirements which would require budget/manpower reprogramming over and above inflation.
Specific Provisions—Support responsibilities negotiated between the supplier and receiver and
detailed in Block 12, DD Form 1144.
Standard Level of Support—The level of support provided to receivers, which is equivalent to
the standard defined and furnished by the supplier to its own mission.
Supplier—An activity, normally the host, which provides support to receivers.
Supplier Address Activity Code—The first series of the number (FB9999) is the supplier
address activity code of the supplying activity.
Support Agreement—A completed DD Form 1144 which documents the support a supplier
provides a receiver, and the reimbursement the receiver will pay for that support. To ensure the
maintenance of a comprehensive logistics record, all significant recurring support provided by
the Air Force shall be recorded on DD Form 1144, whether reimbursable or non-reimbursable.
Also, record all such support on DD Form 1144 when the Air Force is the receiver.

Space Launch Services—Space launch services include organic and contract efforts such as
prelaunch checkout, launch operations, engineering analyses and support (including deficiency

vehicles. Also included are user charges (orbiter flight charges) which are specified by
interagency agreement between DoD and NASA.
