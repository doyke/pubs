                          COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

1.1. Formats Unique to Headquarters Air Force (HAF). HAF formats differ from some of
the other types of correspondence prescribed in this manual. These formats are unique to the
HAF and normally are used for correspondence within the HAF and the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), located in the Washington DC area. Headquarters United States Air Force
(HQ USAF) Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 33-3, Correspondence Preparation,
Control, and Suspense Tracking, outlines instructions for those types of correspondence.
1.2. Plain Language. Prepare all Air Force correspondence using plain language. Plain
language saves the Air Force time, effort, and money. Plain language means using logical
organization and common, everyday words, except for necessary technical terms. Prepare
correspondence using the active voice and short sentences.
   1.2.1. Organize your material to help the reader. Identify your audience for the document;
   write to get their attention and anticipate their questions. Consider any additional readers.
   Always start by putting your main message up front. Present information in the succeeding
   paragraphs in a logical order.
   1.2.2. Avoid words and phrases that your readers might not understand. Define each
   abbreviation or acronym the first time you use it. Use the same term consistently to identify a
   specific thought or object. Use words in a way that does not conflict with ordinary or
   accepted usage. Avoid ambiguous phrasing, confusing legal terms, and technical jargon that
   can mislead your reader.
   1.2.3. Use ―you‖ and other pronouns to speak directly to readers (active voice). Do not refer
   to people as if they were inanimate objects. Address the reader as ―you.‖ ―You‖ reinforces
   the message intended for your reader. Use ―we‖ in place of your organization‘s name. Be
   careful using ―you‖ if it sounds accusatory or insulting. Instead, put the emphasis on the
   organization by using ―we.‖
   1.2.4. Active voice is the best way to identify who is responsible for what action. To
   communicate effectively, write the strong majority (around 75%) of your sentences in the
   active voice.
   1.2.5. Short sentences deliver a clear message. Your sentences should average 15 to 20
   words--never make them longer than 40 words. Complex sentences loaded with dependent
   clauses and exceptions confuse the reader by losing the main point in a forest of words.
   Resist the temptation to put everything in one sentence. Break up your idea into its logical
   parts and make each one the subject of its own sentence. Cut out words that are not really
   necessary.
   1.2.6. Check http://www.plainlanguage.gov, for more plain language techniques.
1.3. Writers‟ Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. Use this manual when preparing correspondence.

    1.3.2. Protect and mark any classified information in your correspondence according to
    Department of Defense (DoD_5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and Air Force
    Instruction (AFI) 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Distribute on a need-
    to-know basis.
    1.3.3. Follow DoD 5400.7-R/Air Force Supplement (AFSUP), DoD Freedom of Information
    Act Program, if you include ―For Official Use Only‖ information, and refer to AFI 33-332,
    Privacy Act Program, if the Privacy Act applies.
    1.3.4. Check Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and
    Associated Terms, and Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-2, Air Force Glossary, for
    correct terms and usage.
    1.3.5. Use the Air Force Address Directory at https://private.afca.af.mil/afdir/index.cfm
    (see Chapter 9) for correct mailing addresses and standard office symbols (see Chapter 10).
    1.3.6. Distribute correspondence on a need-to-know basis.
    1.3.7. Conserve paper. Use backs of scrap paper for drafts and interoffice memos. Consider
    if you can communicate with other means such as a telephone call or electronic mail (E-
    mail). Do not print and mail out correspondence originally sent by E-mail, unless requested.
    Satisfy the minimum distribution requirements only. Utilize two-sided printing whenever
    possible.
    1.3.8. Use the telephone for routine matters. (You can record the inputs on your record copy
    of the final correspondence.)
    1.3.9. Call, use AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request, or E-mail instead of a
    formal memorandum to check the status of an action (see paragraph 8.1).
    1.3.10. Use caution when highlighting material you copy or microfilm, since highlighters
    can obscure the print.
    1.3.11. Select the appropriate distribution method. Some distribution methods include: E-
    mail, facsimile (FAX), Defense Message System (DMS), United States Postal Service
    (USPS), Base Information Transfer System (BITS), and Defense Courier Service. Consider
    the needs of the recipient when choosing the distribution method. Send computer-generated
    information electronically if the receiver will copy the information into another computer
    system.
    1.3.12. Use E-mail before using FAX, BITS, or USPS. However, do not send classified E-
    mail on a system not authorized for that purpose. When transmitting classified E-mail take
    care to transmit only that level of classified information for which the system is certified and
    accredited. When transmitting sensitive unclassified information by E-mail, apply an
    appropriate level of safeguards to ensure the sensitive, but unclassified, information is
    properly protected. For more information refer to AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging. When
    delegating an E-mail task, send a courtesy copy (cc) to the originator.
    1.3.13. Follow AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management
    Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections,
    when requesting information licensed under Public Law (PL) 104-13, The Paperwork
    Reduction Act of 1995.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                             9


   1.3.14. Avoid abbreviations and military jargon. Write out abbreviations the first time used
   and follow with the abbreviation in parenthesis.
   1.3.15. Apply         record         keeping        requirements        listed              on
   https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm when preparing official communications.
1.4. Suspense Actions.
   1.4.1. Set realistic time limits for answering priority and routine correspondence. Establish a
   suspense (due date) only when you need a reply by a specific date. Notify the action agency
   of the suspense date as early as possible.
   1.4.2. Control suspenses at all offices tasked with answering correspondence. Notify the
   originating agency before the due date if the reply is delayed.
   1.4.3. You may use an automated system or AF Form 388, Communication Control Record
   (see paragraph 8.2), to control suspense actions.
1.5. Coordination Process.
   1.5.1. Coordinate with offices affected by the proposed action during the draft stage to keep
   from revising the final version.
   1.5.2. Coordinate by telephone or E-mail when possible. Indicate coordination at the bottom
   or in the right margin of the first page of DoD correspondence. Do not indicate coordination
   in the upper right-hand corner since it is used for the file code (see AFMAN 37-123 [will
   become AFMAN 33-363]).
   1.5.2. (45SW) The originating office is responsible for determining required internal
   coordination and coordination with other staff offices or agencies on the record copy of the
   document. Accomplish complete coordination before forwarding to the wing commander for
   signature or approval.
   1.5.3. You may coordinate using AF Form1768, Staff Summary Sheet (see paragraph 8.3).
   1.5.4. Remember to coordinate with each office that has a functional interest. Consider the
   chain of command to ensure complete coordination. Schedule enough time to finish review
   and coordination.
   1.5.5. (Added-45SW) Forward one copy of all communications from flag and general
   officers to the 45 SW Commander/Vice Commander (45 SW/CC/CV) immediately upon
   receipt.

                                            Chapter 2

                         STATIOINERY STANDARDS AND USES

2.1. Paper Standards. Use 8 1/2-inch by 11-inch paper.
   2.1.1. Original. Use white letterhead stationery (printed or computer-generated) for the first
   page of a memorandum, staff study, report, or minutes of a meeting. Use plain white paper
   for continuation pages. (See paragraph 2.4 for computer-generated letterhead.)
   2.1.2. Copies. Use plain white paper for information or courtesy copies.
   2.1.3. Paper Quality. Stationery is produced from recycled paper that has at least 25 percent
   cotton or rag content. The recycled logo is shown in the watermark. Paper quality must not
   exceed the following:
                  Item             Paper Color      Grade          Pounds
                  Letterhead       White            50% rag        16
                                                    or
                                                    25% rag        20

                  Continuation White                50% rag        16
                                                    or
                                                    25% rag        20

2.2. Standard Letterhead. DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5330.2, Specifications for DoD
Letterheads, establishes the standards for letterheads. There are only two types of letterhead
authorized for use: standard (pre-printed) and computer-generated. Chief master sergeants
(CMSgt) and command chief master sergeants use standard letterhead/stationary. They must use
personal stationary if the CMSgt insignia or symbols are used. Submit any exceptions to the
specified standards through your MAJCOM to SAF/XC for final determination. ANG exceptions
are approved by individual ANG State Headquarters or the Director, Air National Guard.
2.3. Pre-printed Letterhead. See Figure 2.1 for an example of letterhead. MAJCOMs may
elect to use generic two-line command letterhead for command-wide use. MAJCOMs may
authorize letterhead below wing-level if the quantity needed justifies the printing cost or other
circumstances warrant. Any unit without its own letterhead uses its parent unit‘s letterhead
stationery and identifies its organization and standard office symbol in the FROM caption.
   2.3.1. Ink. Print the letterhead and seal using either reflex blue or black ink.
   2.3.2. Seal. The DoD seal is one inch in diameter. Align the seal 1/2-inch from the upper left
   and top edge of the paper. Do not use any other emblem, decorative device, or distinguishing
   insignia with or in place of the DoD seal.
   2.3.3. Format. Center organization name and address on the letterhead using no more than
   four lines:
       2.3.3.1. First Line. DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. Center this line leaving 5/8-
       inch from the top of the sheet. Print it in 12 point uppercase using copperplate letters,
       heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                               11


       2.3.3.2. Second Line. Center the name of the organization as shown in the G-series
       special order that established it. If G-series orders do not exist, the MAJCOM Director of
       Communications decides the second line. Put HEADQUARTERS before the
       organization‘s name only if it appears in the activation order. Print it in 10.5 point
       uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent. If the name
       is more than fifty characters, you may use an additional line.
       2.3.3.3. Third Line. If used, center the location without the ZIP+4 code on this line. Print
       it in 10.5 point uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or
       equivalent. The bottom of the third line should be 1 1/16 inches from the top of the sheet.
       If your unit is overseas, do not show the Army and Air Force Post Office (APO) or Fleet
       Post Office (FPO) number and a geographical location together. You may use the two-
       letter state abbreviation or spell out the state name. Do not use punctuation in the last line
       of the address element.
                                  EXAMPLES:
                  DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS
                     AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND

                          DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE AIR
                         EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND

                      DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
            HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND
                     RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE TEXAS
   2.3.4. Optional Items. Fold marks are guides for judging typing space and for folding the
   paper in three equal parts. Typist guidelines show you are near the 1-inch bottom margin. If
   used, print them in half-point rules (see Figure 2.1).
2.4. Computer-Generated Letterhead. Computer-generated letterhead allows for the use of
plain white bond paper and high production rates. It also permits an organization to generate its
own letterhead stationery.
   2.4.1. Use. You may use computer-generated letterhead the same as printed letterhead when
   the design satisfies all specifications in paragraph 2.3 Use computer-generated letterhead
   only for correspondence within the DoD. Do not use for the signature of the Secretary or
   Deputy Secretary of Defense, or Executive Secretary of the DoD. MAJCOMs may direct the
   use of printed letterhead for headquarters and subordinate units.
   2.4.2. Format. When using computer-generated letterhead, you may identify the office name
   as approved in organizational designation documents. Center the office name below the
   organization name. You may identify the complete mailing address including ZIP+4 code.
   Do not use more than four lines for the letterhead.
2.5. Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Letterhead. HQ USAF offices use
this stationery, as do certain field operating agencies (FOA) when their commanders function as
members of HAF.
2.6. Department of Defense (DoD) Programs and Activities Letterhead. When the
Department of the Air Force is the executive agent for DoD-directed programs, the letterhead
 12                                            AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


format is similar to paragraph 2.3; do not show DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE on the
top line for DoD programs or joint activities. Use this layout instead:
   2.6.1. First line. Print the name of the program as shown in the DoD directive.
   2.6.2. Second and third line. Print the location. For further guidance, contact SAF/XCPPC.
EXAMPLES:
                     DOD MEDICAL EVALUATION REVIEW BOARD
                      USAF ACADEMY COLORADO SPRINGS CO

                    ARMED FORCES VOCATIONAL TESTING GROUP
                           456 ARMY DRIVE, ROOM 407
                      RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE TX 78150-4567
2.7. Slogans. MAJCOMs and FOAs may permit use of slogans on official memorandums and
personalized letters. Slogans will:
   2.7.1. Represent the mission of the organization.
   2.7.2. Be easy to understand.
   2.7.3. Not be offensive.
   2.7.4. Meet printing specifications (printed approximately 1/2-inch from bottom of page).
2.8. Logograms (Logos). Do not use the Department of the Air Force seal on stationery; the
proper use of the Department of the Air Force seal is covered in Attachment 2. DoDI 5330.2
prohibits use of logos, emblems, decorative devices, or distinguishing insignia on stationery.
OSD grants waivers only for programs of Air Force-wide importance and applicability, such as
the Air Force Fiftieth Anniversary. Send waiver requests to SAF/XCPPC for staffing to OSD
through the Washington Headquarters Services. Use existing logo stationery until all supplies are
exhausted.

                                               Chapter 3

                             THE OFFICIAL MEMORANDUM

3.1. General Rules.
   3.1.1. Memorandums are used to communicate with all DoD agencies to include Joint Chiefs
   of Staff, unified and specified commands, and other Federal agencies. They are also used to
   conduct official business outside the Government with vendors or contractors when the
   personalized letter is inappropriate.
   3.1.2. Use printed letterhead, computer-generated letterhead, or plain bond paper. The writer
   decides which stationery is appropriate. See Chapter 2 for stationery formats.
   3.1.3. Type or print on both sides of the paper using black or blue-black ink.
   3.1.4. Use 10 to 12 point fonts for text.
   3.1.5. See DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 for the necessary markings on classified
   correspondence.
   3.1.6. See Figure 3.1 for an example of an official memorandum.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010      15

3.2. Margins. Use 1-inch margins on the left, right, and bottom for most memorandums. For
shorter communications, you may adjust the margins. Use these guidelines:


When memorandum text is:                         Use

20 lines or more                                 1-inch margins

10-19 lines                                      1 to 1 1/2 –inch margins

1-9 lines                                        1 ½ to 2-inch margins


3.3. Heading Format.
   3.3.1. Date Element. Type or stamp the date 1 inch from the right margin, 1.75 inches or 10
   line spaces from the top of the page. Use the format of day, month, and year, for example, 14
   October 2006, for documents signed out of a military organization. Use the format of month,
   day, and year, for example, October 14, 2006, for documents signed out of a civilian
   organization. Unless the date of signature has legal significance, date the original and all
   copies of the correspondence at the time of dispatch.
   3.3.1. (45SW) Do not date correspondence to be signed. For suspense items, ensure AF
   Form 388, Communications Control Record, received at action office is returned with
   correspondence for final processing.
   3.3.2. MEMORANDUM FOR Element. Type ―MEMORANDUM FOR‖ in uppercase, flush
   with the left margin, 2.5 inches or 14 line spaces from the top of the page. After the
   MEMORANDUM FOR element, type two spaces followed by the recipient organization. For
   short communications, you may adjust the top margin in order to center the memorandum.
       3.3.2.1. When addressing one office, type in uppercase the organization name or the
       organization abbreviation and office symbol separated by a virgule (/). You may type a
       name in parentheses after the organization and omit the ―ATTENTION‖ element.
       3.3.2.2. When sending the same memorandum to several offices, prepare a multiple-
       address memorandum. Align subsequent addresses with the first address. Circle,
       underline, or highlight the recipient organization for each copy. Stay consistent; use the
       same format throughout.
EXAMPLES:
MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF
               DIRECTOR, INSTALLATIONS AND LOGISTICS
               GENERAL COUNSEL
or
MEMORANDUM FOR AF/CC

     3.3.2.3. When frequently sending correspondence to the same group of addresses, use a
     categorical address. See Attachment 3 for information on categorical addresses.
     3.3.2.4. When the address list is too long to include in the heading, use a distribution list.
     Type ―MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION.‖ Include the addresses in the
     DISTRIBUTION element or on a separate page attached to the memorandum (see
     paragraph 3.5.5). Note: Organizations may establish distribution codes and lists to satisfy
     internal distribution requirements. To establish distribution codes, the organization must
     provide the distribution list to the Base Information Transfer Center (BITC) and keep the
     list current.
     3.3.2.4. (45SW) Attachment 9, Categorical Addresses, contains a list of activities which
     receive categorically addressed correspondence.
  3.3.3. ATTENTION Element. If the ATTENTION element is used, type ―ATTENTION:‖ or
  ―ATTN:‖ or ―THROUGH:,‖ followed by the name, in uppercase, one line below the
  MEMORANDUM FOR line. Align under the address.
EXAMPLE:
MEMORANDUM FOR SAF/AAX
               ATTENTION: COL JONES
  3.3.4. FROM Element. Type ―FROM:‖ in uppercase, flush with the left margin, two line
  spaces below the last line of the MEMORANDUM FOR element (and the ATTENTION
  element, if used). After the FROM element, type two spaces followed by the organization
  abbreviation and office symbol of the originator. The FROM element contains the full
  mailing address of the originator so that recipients may easily prepare and address return
  correspondence. However, if the complete mailing address is printed on the letterhead (see
  paragraph 2.4.2) or if all recipients for the memorandum are located on the same installation
  as the originator, omit the second and third lines of the FROM element.
     3.3.4.1. The first line of the FROM element includes the organization abbreviation and
     office symbol separated by a virgule and typed in uppercase.
     3.3.4.2. The second line of the FROM element is the delivery address of the originator in
     upper and lower case.
     3.3.4.3. The third line of the FROM element includes the city, state, and ZIP+4 code.
  3.3.5. SUBJECT Element. Type ―SUBJECT:‖ in uppercase, flush with the left margin, two
  line spaces below the last line of the FROM element. After the SUBJECT element, type two
  spaces followed by the subject title; capitalize the first letter of each word except articles,
  prepositions, and conjunctions. Be brief and clear. If you need a second line, align it under
  the first word of the title.
     3.3.5.1. When writing about an individual/employee who is not the addressee, include
     rank/grade and full name in the subject line. If you refer to the person again in the text of
     the memorandum, use only the rank/grade and surname. Do not include names in the
     subject line when writing about two or more individuals. When writing about several
     people, state their full names with rank/grade in the text of the memorandum the first
     time the names appear.

       3.3.5.2. Cite a single reference to a communication or a directive in parentheses
       immediately after the subject title. See paragraph 3.3.6 to cite more than one reference.
EXAMPLE:

SUBJECT: PACAF Work Center Standard (Our Memo, 6 September 2005)
       3.3.5.3. Emphasize a suspense date in the subject element by typing ―SUSPENSE:‖ or
       ―SUSP:‖ with the date in parentheses after the subject title.
EXAMPLE:

SUBJECT: AETC Letterhead Stationery (SUSPENSE: 13 September 2005)
       3.3.5.4. When the communication supersedes a previous communication, type ―S/S‖

       3.3.6.3. Attach a copy of the reference, or instructions to obtain it, if the reader does not
       have it. Type not to all ―(NOTAL)‖ after the citation if not all addressees received the
       referenced item.
3.4. Text of a Memorandum.
   3.4.1. Spacing. The first line of the text begins flush left, two line spaces below the last line
   of the SUBJECT element (or the References element, if used). Single-space the text, but
   double-space between paragraphs and subparagraphs. You may double-space the text of a
   one-paragraph memorandum less than eight lines.
   3.4.2. Paragraphs. Number and letter each paragraph and subparagraph (unless under the
   jurisdiction of HQ USAF HOI 33-3, which requires indented paragraphs without numbers).
   A single paragraph is not numbered. Indent subparagraphs 0.5-inch or five spaces and
   number or letter them in sequence. Use the following format to subparagraph short sentences
   or phrases of a half line or less:
EXAMPLE:

       This format has several advantages: (a) It‘s compact, (b) it highlights ideas, and (c) it
       saves space.
   3.4.3. Place contact names, E-mail addresses, fax numbers, and telephone numbers in the
   last paragraph of the memorandum text.
   3.4.4. Punctuation. Use conventional rules of English grammar. See AFH 33-337, The
   Tongue and Quill, for specific applications.
   3.4.5. Word Division. When dividing a word, separate between syllables (see AFH 33-337).
   3.4.6. Quotations. When quoting numbered paragraphs from another document, cite the
   source and paragraph numbers in your text. See AFH 33-337 for specific applications.
   3.4.7. Suspense Dates. If you include a suspense date in the text of the memorandum,
   emphasize it by placing it in a separate paragraph.
   3.4.8. Identifying Points of Contact. Indicate contact names, telephone numbers, and E-mail
   addresses in the text of the correspondence, normally in the last paragraph.

   3.4.9. Continuation Pages. Use plain bond paper. Begin typing the text of the continuation
   page four lines below the page number. Type at least two lines of the text on each page.
   Avoid dividing a paragraph of less than four lines between two pages.
   3.4.10. Page Numbering. The first page of a memorandum is never numbered. You may
   omit page numbers on a one- or two-page memorandum; however, memorandums longer
   than two pages must have page numbers. Number the succeeding pages starting with page 2.
   Place page numbers 0.5-inch or four line spaces from the top of the page, flush with the right
   margin. Number the continuation pages of each attachment as a separate sequence.
3.5. Closing Format.
   3.5.1. Authority Line Element. The authority line informs readers that the person who signed
   the document acted for the commander, the command section, or the headquarters. If it is
   used, type in uppercase, two line-spaces below the last line of the text and 4.5 inches from
   the left edge of the page or three spaces to the right of the page center. Use the words ―FOR
   THE COMMANDER‖ unless the head of the organization has another title like commander
   in chief, superintendent, or commandant.
      3.5.1.1. Use the authority line when:
          3.5.1.1.1. A commander‘s designated representative signs for a specific action.
          3.5.1.1.2. A document represents the commander‘s position or the coordinated
          position of the headquarters staff.
          3.5.1.1.3. Staff members sign documents that direct action or announce policy within
          their areas of responsibility.
      3.5.1.2. Do not use the authority line when:
          3.5.1.2.1. The commander (or head of the organization) signs.
          3.5.1.2.2. The deputy or vice commander signs when the commander is temporarily
          away from the place of duty unless command action is directed by law and requires
          an indication of delegation.
          3.5.1.2.3. The correspondence expresses opinions of units, directorates, divisions,
          offices, or branches.
          3.5.1.2.4. The correspondence is addressed outside the DoD.
   3.5.2. Signature Element. Type or stamp the signature element five lines below the last line
   of text and 4.5 inches from the left edge of the page or three spaces to the right of page
   center. If the authority line is used, type the signature element five lines below the authority
   line. If dual signatures are required, type the junior ranking official‘s signature block at the
   left margin; type the senior ranking official‘s signature block 4.5 inches from the left edge of
   the page or three spaces to the right of page center. The signature element may be added after
   you are sure who will sign the correspondence. Do not place the signature element on a
   continuation page by itself. Consider correspondence received via E-mail, copied, or stamped
   //SIGNED// as authoritative as long as the signed copy is kept on file at the originating
   office.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                          21


     3.5.2.1. First Line. Type the name in uppercase the way the person signs it. Include grade
     and service if military; civilians may include their grade. Avoid using legal, educational,
     or ecclesiastical degrees or titles.
     3.5.2.2. Second Line. Type the duty title as identified in the ―From‖ element. Use the
     term ―Acting‖ before the duty title of a staff position if the incumbent is absent or the
     position is vacant. Do not sign ―for‖ or ―in the absence of.‖ Do not use the term ―Acting‖
     for any command capacity or where prohibited by law or statute (see AFI 33-321,
     Authentication of Air Force Records; and AFI 51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of
     Command).
     3.5.2.3. Third Line. Type the name of the office or organization level if it is not printed
     on the letterhead or included in the heading. Limit the signature element to three lines if
     possible; however, if a line of the signature element is too long, indent two spaces on the
     next line.

       how to use seals instead of signatures.
   3.5.3. Attachment Element. Type ―Attachment:‖ or ―# Attachments:‖ at the left margin,
   three line spaces below the signature element (see Figure 3.1). Do not number a single
   attachment; when there are two or more attachments, list each by number and in the order
   mentioned in the memorandum. Describe each attachment briefly, but do not use general
   terms or abbreviations such as ―as stated,‖ ―as described above,‖ or ―a/s.‖ Cite the office of
   origin, the type of communication, the date, and the number of copies (in parentheses) if
   more than one. Include the subject of the attachment if the receiver will not get copies of
   attachments or if the subject is not already referenced in text. For classified attachments,
   show the assigned classification symbol (in parentheses).

EXAMPLE:

3 Attachments:
1. SAF/XCI Memo, 30 Jun 05 (U)(2)
2. 380 FMS/CC Msg, 232300Z May 98 (NOTAL)

   3.5.4. Courtesy Copy Element. When sending courtesy copies to activities other than to
   addressee, type ―cc:‖ flush with the left margin, two line spaces below the attachment
   element. If the attachment element is not used, begin typing three line spaces below the

HQ PACAF/A1 (Atch under sep cover)
   3.5.4. (45SW) Any correspondence dispatched to higher headquarters or outside the
   command requires a read file copy be provided to the wing command section.
       3.5.4.1. If courtesy copies of a memorandum are not signed, write or stamp ―signed‖
       with black or dark blue ink above the signature block.
       3.5.4.2. Do not show internal distribution of courtesy copies on the original (or courtesy
       copy) for correspondence addressed outside your activity. However, you may show the
       distribution if one addressee needs to know who received a courtesy copy, or if
       correspondence is multiple-addressed and reproduced.
   3.5.5. DISTRIBUTION Element. When DISTRIBUTION is used for the MEMORANDUM
   FOR element (see paragraph 3.3.2.4), type ―DISTRIBUTION:‖ flush with the left margin,
   two line spaces below the attachment element or the courtesy copy element, if used. If both
   the attachment element and the courtesy copy element are not used, begin typing three line
   spaces below the signature element. Do not divide distribution lists between two pages. If the
   listing is too long, type ―DISTRIBUTION: (listed on next page),‖ and list the organizations
   on a separate page.
   3.5.6. Optional Automated File Designator (AFD) Element. The AFD element documents
   the storage location for data stored on disks or other magnetic media. Type the AFD two line
   spaces below the courtesy copy distribution element. You may include the AFD in the
   identification line of talking, position, and bullet background papers.
       3.5.6.1. Contents of the AFD are based on the user‘s needs and the system being used;
       e.g., the element may include items such as the file name, typist‘s initials, and number or
       title of the disk.
       3.5.6.2. Refer to World Wide Web (WWW) pages by typing the uniform resource
       locator (URL) as the AFD.
3.6. Typeset Correspondence. You may typeset correspondence for a large audience (such as a
memorandum to ALMAJCOM-FOA). Use an appropriate letterhead as with other official
correspondence. You can use the full range of typesetting capabilities, including, but not limited
to, two columns, italics, bold type, variable spacing, boxed inserts, and screened backgrounds.
3.7. Record or Coordination Copy. This is the official record for your office files, so make
sure it is completely legible. Type or write additional information of value only to the office of
record on the record or coordination copy.
   3.7.1. Showing Coordination. Type or write the organization abbreviation and office symbol
   of each office that should coordinate across the bottom or right side of the record copy. The
   coordinating officials enter their last name and date.
   3.7.2. Showing Internal Courtesy Copy Distribution. List all internal courtesy distribution on
   the record copy unless it is listed on the original.

   3.7.3. Identifying the Writer. If identifying the writer is of value to the office of record, place
   the writer‘s organization abbreviation and office symbol, name, telephone number, typist‘s
   initials, the date the correspondence is typed, and, if desired, the document name/number at
   the top or bottom margin of the page. Do not repeat the writer‘s name if the writer signed the
   correspondence. Use a new identification line, if desired, each time the correspondence is
   rewritten or retyped. Place the name of the person who rewrote it on the next line followed
   by the date it was retyped.
   3.7.4. Annotating for Magnetic Storage Media. Use the writer identification line (see
   paragraph 3.7.3) to show document name, storage location, or file identification for reference
   and possible revision or reprinting.
   3.7.5. Preparing a Memorandum for Record (MR). When preparing a MR for another office
   or when using it as your primary record, write or type on the record copy any information
   needed for the record. Continue on the back or a separate sheet if you need more space. The
   writer then signs the MR (see AFH 33-337).
3.8. Attachments to Correspondence. Attachment, appendix, annex, and exhibit all mean
additional or supplementary material and indicate relative position within a correspondence
package. The first addition is an attachment; an addition to an attachment is an appendix; an
addition to an appendix is an annex; and so on. Indicate on the attachment, appendix, or annex if
there are appendices, annexes, or exhibits to it. Type or write attachment markings in the same
position as on the basic correspondence. If possible, use pencil to allow future renumbering and
reuse with other documents. Mark attachments as follows:
   3.8.1. Mark each attachment in the lower right corner as Atch 1, Atch 2, Atch 3, etc.
   3.8.2. Mark additions to an attachment as Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix C, etc.
   3.8.3. Mark additions to appendices as Annex 1, Annex 2, Annex 3, etc.
   3.8.4. Mark additions to an annex as Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, etc.
   3.8.5. For multiple page attachments, number the pages of each attachment in a separate
   sequence. For example Atch 1 (1 of 3), Atch 1 (2 of 3), Atch 1 (3 of 3), etc.
   3.8.6. When sending more than one copy of an attachment, place the copy number (typed or
   handwritten) to the right and slightly above the attachment number to indicate the copy is the
   first, second, third, etc. For example Atch 11, Atch 12, Atch 13, etc.
3.9. Arranging Correspondence. See Figure 3.3 for the order to arrange correspondence for
signature. When using tabs, position the first tab at the lower right corner. Position the next tab
slightly higher (see Figure 3.4). Staple a memorandum of more than one page, or with
attachments, in the upper left corner before dispatch. If possible, arrange pages so that the reader
can read information without removing the staples or paper clips; for example, turn landscape
pages with top to the left. If required, prepare envelopes or facsimile cover sheets, and place
them at the left side behind the copies for dispatch. Use a paper or binder clip to hold the packet
together before dispatch. Organizations may specify alternate methods to suit their needs.

two columns to list names of members present. Place information regarding a future meeting in
the last paragraph. When a person signs a paper as a member of a board or committee, the
signature element indicates that person‘s status on that board or committee, not any other
position the person may hold. Type ―Approved as written‖ two line spaces below the recorder‘s
signature block, followed by the approving authority‘s signature block.
4.7. Staff Study Report. This is a problem-solution report (see AFH 33-337).
4.8. Point, Talking, Bullet Background, and Position Papers. (See AFH 33-337.)

   4.8.1. Point and talking papers are concise, factual, written outlines for oral presentations,
   memory ticklers, or quick reference outlines. They use fragments to present key points,
   positions, and facts in a brief, orderly fashion when the user has knowledge of the subject.
   4.8.2. Background papers are multipurpose written briefs used to provide information,
   forward items of interest, or to summarize current or potential problems. They include an
   introductory paragraph, a basic discussion, and a conclusion.
   4.8.3. Position papers are used to advocate or to convince the reader on an argument or
   position.
4.9. Information Mapping. You may use the information mapping method for staff study
reports and for point, talking, bullet background, and position papers. The Information Mapping
methodology helps writers analyze, organize, and present information in a concise, user-friendly
manner. Information Mapping principles can improve a wide variety of communications. For
more information, contact SAF/XCPPC.
4.10. Indorsement Memorandums. Indorsements are used at the discretion of the sender as
space allows (see AFH 33-337).

                         GUIDE AND FORM MEMORANDUMS

5.1. Guide Memorandums. These are models of a memorandum text composed in advance,
but not printed. They may be complete memorandums with several paragraphs or a single
paragraph. Use guide memorandums to compose official memorandums. Select the combination
of paragraphs appropriate for the reply.
5.2. Form Memorandums. These are mass-produced memorandums sent in place of
individually composed or typed memorandums when many individuals require similar
information or the same individual requires the information at frequent intervals. These also
include standard formats stored on electronic media that can be accessed, completed with
optional data, and then printed or electronically forwarded.
   5.2.1. Types of Form Memorandums. The three basic formats for form memorandums are
   prewritten, fill-in, and optional statement. Prewritten form memorandums omit the receiver‘s
   name, address, and date. Fill-in form memorandums omit any information that varies with
   each response. Optional statement form memorandums provide several options; the writer
   checks the statements that apply to the specific situation. A form memorandum may have
   space for filling in information, selecting one of several statements, or both.
   5.2.2. Form Memorandums Use. Use form memorandums when the subject matter and the
   action are routine or informational, when it is more economical to duplicate the
   memorandum than to type each memorandum individually, and when the printed format
   expedites response from the recipient. Do not use form memorandums if the subject is of a
   personal or congratulatory nature, if it may bring grief, disappointment, or embarrassment to
   the recipient, or if a numbered form would be better.
   5.2.3. Preparing and Controlling Form Memorandums:
       5.2.3.1. Justification. Analyze your correspondence for a 2-week period and group
       memorandums that are similar in meaning and purpose. Count the number of individually
       typed memorandums for each group. A form memorandum is justified if:
          The line count (text) of a repetitive And the number of similar
          memorandum is:                        memorandums written each month is:


          5                                     30 or more
          10                                    15 or more
          15                                    10 or more


NOTE: Check with your publications/forms manager to determine if a numbered form would be
more beneficial.
       5.2.3.2. Composition. Follow the principles of writing in AFH 33-337. Consider the
       memorandum‘s impact, especially if it is sent outside the Air Force. If a memorandum
       collects information, review the requirements of the PL 104-13 and AFI 33-324.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                    33


     5.2.3.3. Design. Leave enough blank space to complete a fill-in form memorandum.
     Align check boxes ( � ) on an optional statement form memorandum
     5.2.3.4. Signature. Sign form memorandums individually or sign the master before
     reproduction.
     5.2.3.5. Control. Identify each form or guide memorandum by a different symbol if you
     have more than one, e.g., FM-1, FM-2, etc.; GM-1, GM-2, etc. You may mark the
     memorandums themselves or their folders. Review the need and currency of the
     memorandum before reproduction, and reproduce no more than a 3-month supply.

                                    USE OF ENVELOPES

6.1. General Information. Use standard addresses listed in the Air Force address directory (see
Chapter 9).
6.2. Envelope Size.
   6.2.1. Use a rectangular envelope only slightly larger than the correspondence. Envelopes
   should be no smaller than 3.5 by 5 inches and no larger than 6.125 by 11.5 inches.
   6.2.2. You may use window envelopes. Be sure to adjust the MEMORANDUM FOR
   element to align the address with the envelope window.
   6.2.3. For consolidated mailing, the largest item that cannot be folded determines the
   envelope size (see DoDI 4525.8 /AFSUP).
6.3. Addressing the Envelope. For successful processing by optical character recognition
(OCR) equipment, the USPS requires addresses to be machine-printed, with a uniform left
margin, and formatted in a manner that allows an OCR to recognize the information.
   6.3.1. Printing. Use a typewriter or print addresses on a laser printer. You may not hand
   write or use rubber stamps unless laser printers and appropriate software are not available.
   6.3.2. Typeface. Use Courier New font 12 point (or similar simple sans serif font). Be sure
   characters are not too close together and do not touch or overlap. Do not use bold, italic,
   script, artistic, or other unusual typefaces.
   6.3.3. Margins. Leave margins at least 0.5-inch from the left and right edges of the envelope
   and at least 0.625-inch from the bottom of the envelope. The last line of the address should
   be no lower than 0.625-inch and no higher than 2.75 inches from the bottom of the envelope.
   6.3.4. Address Format. See Figure 6.1 for address position and format. Use block style with
   a uniform left margin, parallel to the long edge of the envelope. Single-space the address
   block and type the entire addresses in uppercase. Use one or two spaces between words. Do
   not use punctuation in the last two lines of the address block except for the dash in the ZIP+4
   code. Addresses are limited to five lines:
       6.3.4.1. Optional Address Data Line. Use this line for any nonaddress data such as
       account numbers, presort codes, or mail stop codes.
       6.3.4.2. Optional Attention Line. Use this line to direct mail to a specific person.
       6.3.4.3. Organization Abbreviation/Office Symbol Line. Use the organization
       abbreviation and office symbol separated by a virgule. Refer to the address directory for
       correct abbreviations.
       6.3.4.4. Delivery Address Line. Use this line for the street or post office box number, and
       the room or suite number. Use authorized USPS abbreviations found in USPS Publication
       28. Do not use punctuation on this line.
       6.3.4.5. City or Base, State, ZIP+4 Code Line. Use the two-letter state abbreviations
       found in USPS Publication 28. Always include the ZIP+4 code in the address. Do not use
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                           35


      commas between the city or base, abbreviation, and ZIP+4 code; the dash in the ZIP+4
      code is the only punctuation used in the last address line. With overseas addresses, do not
      use the APO or FPO number and geographical location together; this will cause the mail
      to enter the international mail channels. Do not type any information below or to the right
      of the city, state, and ZIP+4 code address line.

Figure 6.1. Envelope Address Position and Format.




   6.3.5. Return Address Format. Place the return address in the upper left corner of the
   envelope (see Figure 6.2). Follow the address format (see paragraph 6.3.4). Use the complete
   mailing address. Type ―OFFICIAL BUSINESS‖ beneath the return address (see DoDI
   4525.8 /AFSUP).

6.4. Machine-Processed Mailing. Limit the thickness of the envelope to 0.25 inch or less when
sealed (about four sheets of bond paper or eight tissue weight sheets). Press envelope to remove
air. Write ―nonmachinable‖ above the address on the envelope if it is more than 0.25 inch thick
(see DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP).

                                            Chapter 7

                      MESSAGE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING

7.1. Introduction. This chapter discusses preparing messages for the Defense Message System
(DMS). The DMS is a flexible, network centric application layer system that provides high-
grade, secure messaging and directory services capabilities. It provides message service to all
DoD users (to include deployed tactical users), access to and from world wide DoD locations,
and interface to other United States (US) Government agencies, allies, and defense contractors.
The DMS will handle information of all classification levels (unclassified through TOP
SECRET), compartments, and handling instructions. DoD mandates the use of DMS for all
organizational messages. Organizational messages are communications exchanged between
organizational elements in support of command and control, combat support, combat service
support, and other functional activities (defined by each functional community). Organizational
messages provide formal direction or establish a formal position, commitment, or response on
behalf of an organization.
7.2. Roles and Responsibilities. The following roles and responsibilities are primary to the
support of desktop DMS organizational messaging.
   7.2.1. Originator‘s Responsibilities. The originator is the command or authority in whose
   name (organization) a message is sent. The originator implements the policy and procedures
   for preparing and releasing messages and imposes and/or adheres to MINIMIZE when
   imposed for record communications (see paragraph 7.7). The originator will:
       7.2.1.1. Designate releasers to send DMS messages. Persons assigned to this function
       should have the appropriate clearance to handle the classification level of information
       received.
       7.2.1.2. Appoint an administrator to make distribution on messages received, if duty is
       not assigned to the releaser and distribution is not made by automated means. See
       paragraph 7.10 on automated means of message distribution.
       7.2.1.3. Ensure all personnel using DMS are properly trained.
   7.2.2. Drafter‘s Responsibilities. The drafter prepares messages using the procedures
   outlined in this chapter and the checklist in Attachment 4. Drafters do not require a
   FORTEZZA card to draft messages but do need a DMS user agent software loaded on their
   workstation to add addresses to the draft message header. The drafter will:
       7.2.2.1. Identify recipients‘ address for releaser.
       7.2.2.2. Identify distribution instruction and restrictions.
       7.2.2.3. Identify handling instructions.
       7.2.2.4. Adhere to MINIMIZE when imposed for record communications (see paragraph
       7.7).
   7.2.3. Releaser‘s Responsibilities. The releaser is the individual authorized by the originator
   (commander) to release messages for that organization. The releaser requires a FORTEZZA
   card and a DMS user agent to release messages. The releaser will:
38                                            AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


     7.2.3.1. Verify the accuracy of the message format using the checklist at Attachment 3.
     7.2.3.2. Verify the recipients‘ address prior to transmission.
     7.2.3.3. Set the military properties (i.e., precedence, classification, delivery report, etc.)
     of the message per paragraph 7.6
     7.2.3.4. Maintain a personal address book (PAB) for frequently used DMS addresses.
     This will save time when addressing DMS messages. To maintain accurate addresses, the
     PAB synchronization tool should be loaded on the DMS workstation (see local
     communications squadron for tool). Note: Creating a PAB for office use and saving on a
     shared drive would facilitate access by more than one person, but only by one person at a
     time. See Attachment 5 on the process of creating and accessing a PAB on a common or
     shared drive.
     7.2.3.5. Where assured delivery is required, request delivery report and/or retain read
     receipts in the military properties applicable tabs that relate to the released message in
     such a manner that they can readily be retrieved in conjunction with the subject message.
     7.2.3.6. Enforce and/or adhere to MINIMIZE procedures when imposed for record
     communications.
     7.2.3.7. Verify distribution instruction and restriction to the message.
  7.2.4. Communications     Squadron     or    Communications        Support     Organization
  Responsibilities. The communications squadron is responsible for the operation of DMS. The
  commander will:
     7.2.4.1. Ensure customers‘ computers user agents designated for DMS are configured
     with current DMS software.
     7.2.4.2. Establish end-user training           program      for   the      customers    using
     https://private.afca.af.mil/ dms/.
     7.2.4.3. Establish error resolution procedures for resolving non-deliver of messages.
     7.2.4.4. Establish procedures for issuance and retrieval of FORTEZZA card.
     7.2.4.5. Provide certified message text editor software for customers.
     7.2.4.6. Notify end-user when DMS components are degraded to the extent message
     traffic does not flow.
     7.2.4.7. Provide automated profiling for message distribution and notification, per
     customer request.
  7.2.5. Recipient/Addressee‘s Responsibilities. The minimum DMS capability for an
  organization is one FORTEZZA-based DMS account per each two letter at Headquarters Air
  Force/USAF/MAJCOM/ Numbered Air Force Headquarters, and one per each organization
  FOA/direct reporting unit (DRU)/base or wing. Each organization with a DMS account will:
     7.2.5.1. Appoint a DMS organizational mailbox administrator to:
         7.2.5.1.1. Ensure the DMS mailbox is managed to ensure messages are properly
         distributed and acted on according to message instructions. The mailbox may be
         managed manually or by automated profiling technology. See your local
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                                39


           communications support organization for automated profiling options (see paragraph
           7.10).
              7.2.5.1.1.1. Ensure DMS messages are distributed according to the distribution
              instructions contained in the message. Permission should be received from the
              originator to distribute messages outside of the organization.
                  7.2.5.1.1.1.1. To distribute messages to non-DMS accounts, convert the
                  message to a simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) (regular E-mail) by
                  clicking on the ―Convert‖ DMS ICON on the toolbar and then forward to the
                  addressee within the base domain E-mail address from the Global Address
                  List (GAL). Consider handling PERSONAL FOR messages sent to a DMS
                  organization mailbox in this manner by converting the message and sending it
                  to intended recipient‘s personal SMTP account. Always request a read receipt
                  on PERSONAL FOR messages.
                  7.2.5.1.1.1.2. To distribute message to DMS accounts, simply forward the
                  message to a DMS address retrieved from the Directory Information Tree
                  (DIT).
              7.2.5.1.1.2. Adhere to MINIMIZE when imposed for record communications.
       7.2.5.2. Reply to a DMS message as a DMS message, signed and encrypted.
           7.2.5.2.1. Conduct regular mailbox cleanup. File DMS messages in accordance with
           AFRIMS RDS located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm. Note: All DMS
           messages must be decrypted prior to electronically filing and access to these records
           must be limited to those with proper security clearance and need to know.
           7.2.5.2.2. Handle messages according to its precedence level of the message. See
           paragraph 7.10. on handling guidelines.
           7.2.5.3. When replying or responding to a DMS message outside of the base domain,
           respond as a DMS message, signed and encrypted.
7.3. Message Preparation. The United States Message Text Format (USMTF) provides the
joint formats required for efficient and unambiguous data and information exchange and thus is
required for all organizational messages. Draft the messages using certified message preparation
software. Obtain the software from your local communications squadron. See Attachment 6 for
USMTF message preparation.
   7.3.1. General Message Format. Prepare the message in sentence case. However, to avoid
   confusion in message text, recommend using upper case. Do not underline any part of the
   message. Limit punctuation symbols to dollar sign ($), ampersand (&), open parenthesis ((),
   close parenthesis ()), dash (-), apostrophe (‗), quotation mark (―), period (.), colon (:), virgule
   (/), comma (,), question mark (?), and semicolon (;). Automatic Digital Network
   (AUTODIN) will accept other punctuation symbols in the message text; however, the
   receiving equipment may not be able to reproduce those symbols.
   7.3.2. Message Staffing. DMS messages should be staffed using local policies for
   coordinating and releasing organizational electronic communications. DMS messages may be
   saved as an ―Outlook Template‖, ―Message Format‖, or ―Text Only‖ file types and attached
   to the e-staffing package. In addition, the message may be saved in the Outlook draft folder
 40                                            AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


   and attached to the e-staffing package. Each of the options, with the exception of Outlook
   Template file type, allows for easy review and editing. With Outlook Template, all changes
   during the review process require the reviewer to resave the file as an Outlook Template and
   reattach the saved file to the e-staffing package. Note: The default location when saving
   Outlook Template file types is usually the ―Template‖ folder on the local hard drive.
   Recommend changing this location to one for your documents.
7.4. Message Address Header. The message header includes the fields for recipients, both
action and information, and the subject. This area is not encrypted. Messages could be sent to a
single organization address, DMS and/or plain language addresses (PLA), to a collective address,
Mail List/Address List(ML/AL), or an Address Indicators Group (AIG). If the intended recipient
is not listed in the DMS directory, send the message to the parent organization with distribution
instruction to forward to the intended recipient. MLs/ALs and AIGs are only to be used for
action addresses. Addresses are limited to 150 entries (a ML/AL or AIG is one entry) Note: An
organization must be an authorized submitter of a ML/ AL or AIG to send to it. Authorization
comes from the cognizant authority for the ML/AL or AIG.
   7.4.1. FROM Address: Specify to the message recipient the identity of the message
   originator. Since DMS messaging is organizational, the FROM address must reflect the
   organization and office symbol. This address is retrieved from the GAL and inserted into the
   ―FROM” field of the address header.
   7.4.2. TO Address: Addresses must be selected from the DMS DIT and added to the PAB.
   Conducting a search operation is the recommended way to retrieve PLA and multiple DMS
   addresses from the DIT. See Attachment 5 on creating and adding addresses to the PAB.
       7.4.2.1. For DMS messages sent to another DMS address, retrieve addresses from the
       Organization-level of the DIT. Select the base, the specific organization, and office to
       send the message to. Add the entry to your PAB, by selecting the ―Add to PAB‖ icon on
       the toolbar. Modify the display name.
       7.4.2.2. For DMS messages sent to AUTODIN addresses, retrieve addresses from the
       AUTODIN PLA-level of the DIT under the DoD-level. The AUTODIN (Message
       Conversion System) Central Directory Component database (in synchronization with the
       DMS directory) is the authoritative source of PLA information. Modify the PLA address
       by adding the office symbol of the intended recipient in the PLA X.500 address.
       Attachment 5 contains instructions on modifying the PLA. Note: Expanding any level
       under the AUTODIN PLA-level (clicking on the ―+‖ to the left of the entry) is not
       advisable and may take several minutes to display due to the massive number of PLAs in
       the directory.
   7.4.3. INFORMATION or COPY Addresses (Courtesy and Blind Courtesy Copy): Enter
   DMS addresses from the PAB that were retrieved from the DIT for each organization that
   needs the message for information purposes. Do not use AIGs or MLs/ALs as information
   addressees.
   7.4.4. Message Subject. All organizational messages will have a subject. The subject should
   be a short description of the message. Since header information is not encrypted, do not
   include any information in the subject line that should be protected from unauthorized access.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                             41


      7.4.4.1. The subject classification must precede the subject (i.e., (U) for
      UNCLASSIFIED, (C) CONFIDENTIAL, (S) SECRET, and (TS) for TOP SECRET).
      Subject classification cannot be higher than the classification level of the network
      transporting the message.
      7.4.4.2. The subject line of messages addressed to AUTODIN recipients should also
      include a date-time group (DTG) after the subject for cross-referencing within
      AUTODIN. Use the format specified in paragraph 7.10.5.
7.5. Message Text. All organizational messages are prepared in plain text USMTF. See
Attachment 7 to ensure compliance with USMTF text format requirements.
   7.5.1. Message Size.
      7.5.1.1. The maximum size of a DMS to DMS organizational message shall not exceed
      4.128 megabytes, to include attachments.
      7.5.1.2. The maximum size of a DMS to AUTODIN organizational message shall not
      exceed 1,128 kilobytes.
   7.5.2. Security Classification. The first and last line of the message will include the security
   classification. The classification must be followed by and preceded with a blank line,
   separating the classification lines from the rest of the message. Insert a space between each
   letter of the classification, except for unclassified.
      7.5.2.1. As applicable, special handling designators, caveat phrases (i.e., PERSONAL
      FOR), flag words, code words, and the word exercise are also included in the first line.
      Example: UNCLAS PERSONAL FOR USAF CHIEF OF STAFF. Classified messages
      addressed to US activities for distribution to non-US activities must include releasability
      statements following the classification. Example: S E C R E T RELEASABLE TO
      NATO AS NATO SECRET.
      7.5.2.2. For Exercise messages, always use the words ―EXERCISE EXERCISE
      EXERCISE‖ as the last words of the message text.
   7.5.3. Delivery Instructions. If used, identify the specific addressee for delivery. Type
   ―FOR‖ followed by the name or position title when there is a specific person identified for
   delivery. Type ―PASS TO‖ for address instructions to direct the message to a particular
   organization or unit.
   7.5.4. Action Suspense. The action suspense indicates when you need to complete the
   required action. Use it only when necessary. Type ―SUSPENSE‖ followed by the required
   date.
   7.5.5. Message Division. You may divide a message into parts if portions of the message do
   not apply to all addressees. See the example in paragraph 7.5.8
   7.5.6. References. Use references only when they are essential. When using references, type
   their identification on the second or subsequent lines of text. Include the reference subject
   only when needed. If reference is made to several messages, letters, memorandums, or other
   documents, type each on a separate line. Identify the references as A., B., and so on.
   7.5.7. Main Body. Keep the main body brief. Use the paragraph format, standard
   punctuation, abbreviations, and numbering as used in normal military correspondence. Begin
 42                                            AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


   all lines, including the first line of subparagraphs, flush with the left margin. For classified
   messages, mark all paragraphs and subparagraphs with their classification (DoD 5200.1-R
   /AFI 31-401) in the same manner as normal correspondence. The last line of the text must
   include declassification or downgrading instructions.
   7.5.8. Attachments. Any file type may be used as attachments for DMS to DMS messaging,
   however, only text-based USMTF attachments (AdatP3) can be attached to a DMS to
   AUTODIN message. When including attachments, be aware of the maximum size limitation
   (see paragraph 7.5.1). The message must be adhered to, as defined in paragraph 7.5.1

7.6. Military Message Properties Fields. Military message properties must be assigned to
each organizational message prior to release. In order to assign message properties, the releaser
must be logged into his/her FORTEZZA card. The Military Message Properties are assigned by
selecting the Military Message icon from the toolbar of the message. Find an overview of
information in each Tab going to that Tab and clicking on the ―?‖ in the upper right corner of the
window. The following areas are required:
   7.6.1. Military Tab.
       7.6.1.1. Basic Properties.
           7.6.1.1.1. Primary Precedence specifies the urgency of the subject to the primary
           recipients, and those who have the responsibility to act on the delivered message
           (addressee in the ―TO‖ field). See Table 7.1 for criteria on selecting precedence
           levels.
           7.6.1.1.2. Copy Precedence. Since the message is provided for informational purpose
           for copy recipients and a notification of receipt is not required, the precedence level
           should be set at no higher than ―ROUTINE‖.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                                  43

                7.6.1.1.3. Classification. Select overall classification for the message. Classification
                options are determined by classification level of the network and must match the
                classification in the first line of the message body. These options are specific to the
                role on the user‘s FORTEZZA card and selection can only be made if logged into the
                FORTEZZA card.
                7.6.1.1.4. Message Type. For general organizational messages select the option,
                Other Organizational. Select other options as applicable followed by an identification
                of the specific exercise, operation, project, or drill in the Name field.
           7.6.1.2. Security Level. Select ―Digitally sign the message‖ and ―Encrypt message
           contents and attachments.‖
           7.6.1.3. Delivery Options. Deselect any option in this area.
    7.6.2. Message Tab. Request read receipt for all messages for assured deliverability. Select
    ―All‖ or ―Explicit Recipients‖ from the drop down menu.
    7.6.3. Per Recipient Tab. Request a delivery report for each recipient by highlighting each
    recipient in the Recipients box and selecting Delivery report. Note: Delivery report does not
    imply the recipient has read the message, only that it has been delivered to the Mailbox on
    the Group Ware Server.
    7.6.4. Advanced Tab. Under Conversion Options, select ―Allow applicable conversions on
    this message‖ to allow the recipient to convert the message for onward distribution to non-
    DMS addresses.
    7.6.5. Information Tab. When sending to an AUTODIN PLA, enter local release time and
    date in the ―Client/Local Release Time & Date‖ field, using local, 24-hour time in the format
    hh:mm MM/DD/ YY; Example: 14:00 09/02/01. Click the OK button and go back into the
 44                                            AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


   Information tab. The Univer sal Time Coordinated ―(UTC) Release Time & Date‖ field is
   automatically filled in for you. This becomes the DTG in AUTODIN. Convert this time to
   the DTG and include in the message subject line for DMS to AUTODIN messages. The
   format to use for DTG is ―ddhhmmZ MMM YY‖. The ―dd‖ is the first two digits
   representing the date of the current month, the next four digits represent the UTC (or ZULU)
   time in the UTC Release Time & Date field, followed by the letter ―Z‖ (for ZULU), a space,
   the first three letters of the current month, a space, and the last two digits in the year.
   Example: 021400Z SEP 04.
7.7. MINIMIZE. Commanders impose MINIMIZE for record communications within their
area of responsibility unless specified or denied by appropriate higher authority. Users of DMS
must adhere to MINIMIZE when imposed for record communications. MINIMIZE may be
imposed during crisis situations in order to reduce the system traffic load, and to ensure that
essential traffic can be processed in a timely manner. The originator is responsible to ensure
MINIMIZE is considered and imposed on all messages released during the MINIMIZE period.
When MINIMIZE is imposed, commands will:
   7.7.1. Identify specific messaging restrictions, i.e., minimum precedence level of messages
   transmitted within the affected area.
7.8. Non-Delivery of Messages. If a message does not reach its intended recipients, non-
delivery notices (message rejects) are returned to the DMS organizational mailbox that the
message was sent from. If the non-delivery was due to user error, refer back to message
preparation sections for clarification. If the non-delivery was due to the system, report them to
your work group manager or network control center for resolution. Attachment 8 provides the
most common non-delivery notices and resolution.
7.9. FORTEZZA Card. The FORTEZZA card provides the high assurance cryptographic
services to the DMS applications. It contains certificates to provide for confidentiality, user
identification, and authentication. It allows for multiple user identities or roles. Only
organizational message releasers require a FORTEZZA card.
   7.9.1. The Personal Identification Number and FORTEZZA card should never be stored in
   the same location to prevent unauthorized use of the card and DMS.
   7.9.2. For Windows NT operating systems, the FORTEZZA card must be in the PCMIA
   card reader when the computer is powered on.
7.10. Message Distribution and Handling. The Air Force has adopted the Defense Message
Dissemination System as a means to automate the dissemination of incoming message traffic and
to assist commands with notification of 24x7 high-precedence message traffic.
   7.10.1. High precedence messages require preferential handling due to the urgency and
   critical nature of the subject matter and notification is immediately upon receipt. High
   precedence messages are CRITIC, ECP, and FLASH. Assignment of precedence is the
   responsibility of the originator. Action is taken on high-precedence messages ahead of all
   other messages. See your local communications squadron for more information. The
   following guidelines are provided to properly handle precedence messages:
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                        45


     7.10.1.1. Each base or site must establish/identify a location to receive and make
     notification on high-precedence message traffic, i.e., CRITIC, ECP, and FLASH
     precedence messages. The Command Post or Center is the preferred location.
     7.10.1.2. Automated notification for high precedence message traffic is prohibited.
  7.10.2. Organizations will develop procedures for Immediate and Priority Message
  notifications. Automated notification during off-duty hours is authorized.
  7.10.3. Routine Messages are processed and handled according to local procedures.

                      COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT FORMS

8.1. AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request. Use this form to let senders know
the status of their correspondence. You may document comments on the record copy. You may
use the AF Form 74 Remarks section for notification of official Air Force business other than
communications status, as authorized by your MAJCOM. You can use the form as a postcard
between activities serviced either by the military distribution system or the USPS.
8.2. AF Form 388, Communication Control Record. Use the AF Form 388 only when you
require formal suspense controls. Use it when you receive correspondence and need to assign
action within your office or to a lower office, or use it to track correspondence requiring a reply
by a specific date. When you use the AF Form 388:
   8.2.1. File the original or a copy by the suspense date and attach all other copies to the
   correspondence.
   8.2.2. Show any extension of the suspense date on the form and refile accordingly.
8.3. AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet. Use the AF Form 1768 to summarize staff work,
to request action, or to forward information. Since it often contains several handwritten notes
before reaching the approval authority, AF Forms 1768 do not require the same level of
perfection (error-free typing, etc.) as the correspondence they may cover. Correct errors neatly
and legibly in ink if the content and meaning are still legible and clear. Generally, limit it to one
page. Use plain bond paper if an additional page is required (see Figure 8.1). If more than ten
offices coordinate on the original, use a blank AF Form 1768, and renumber the TO block,
starting with 11. Complete the AF Form 1768 through the subject and attach it behind the
original AF Form 1768. See Figure 8.2 for assembling SSS packages. Coordination is as
follows:
   8.3.1. When you agree with the proposed action, sign your surname, rank or grade, and date
   on the bottom line if you are the addressee; sign on the top line if you are not the addressee.
   8.3.2. When you do not agree with the proposed action, write a memorandum to the action
   office stating your reasons and write in ink ―See Memorandum‖ in the signature column of
   the AF Form 1768 after your office symbol. Attach your memorandum and return it to the
   action office.
   8.3.3. Try to resolve all differences when you receive a non-concurrence on an AF Form
   1768.
       8.3.3.1. If you cannot resolve the differences, the action officer must write a rebuttal
       memorandum to the approval authority which states differences discussed with the
       nonconcurring official and explains why you cannot change the proposed action. Attach
       the rebuttal memorandum and the non-concurrence memorandum as the last tab to the
       original AF Form 1768, and annotate in pen the additional tab under the list of tabs. Send
       it to the next addressee shown on the AF Form 1768.
       8.3.3.2. If you resolve differences and no changes are made to the AF Form 1768 or to
       any attachments, the previously nonconcurring official shows concurrence by marking
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                      47


     through the statement ―See Memorandum‖ and signing surname, rank or grade, and date.
     The action officer annotates ―Differences resolved and no changes needed‖ on the non-
     concurrence memorandum, initials the statement, and attaches this memorandum to the
     record or coordination copy. Route the AF Form 1768 to the next addressee shown on the
     form.
     8.3.3.3. If you resolve your differences and changes are made to the AF Form 1768 or to
     any attachments, the action officer must prepare a new AF Form 1768 and coordinate it
     as a new package with all offices.

                           AIR FORCE ADDRESS DIRECTORY

9.1. Purpose of the System. The address directory contains official addresses of Air Force
activities. These addresses include the complete mailing address for all major Air Force
organizations and the PLA for messages; and the Defense Switched Network (DSN) telephone
numbers and FAX numbers for some units. Using the correct address allows for direct delivery
of communications and parcels to the desired addressee and expedites the processing and
delivery of communications. Reference the address directory for the correct mailing address
when preparing envelopes.
9.2. Access to the Directory. The address directory is located on the WWW at
https://private.afca.af.mil/afdir/index.cfm. The intent of the address directory is to provide Air
Force and other government users a simple and easy way to obtain address information on an
occasional basis. Users who require an off-line electronic copy of the directory may download a
copy from the site. Users who do not have access to the WWW and require a copy should
contact their local Defense Automated Printing Service. Non-military and non-government users
who do not have access to the directory and require a copy may submit a Title 5 United States
Code (U.S.C.) § 552 request to HQ AFCA/CCQI, 203 W. Losey St., Room 1004, Scott AFB IL
62225-5222. Direct specific questions about the address directory through appropriate channels
to HQ AFCA/EAL.
9.3. Preparing Communications for Dispatch. Place the organization abbreviation, office
symbol, street address, room or suite number, geographic location, and ZIP+4 code on the
envelope as shown in Chapter 6. The term headquarters (HQ) is a part of the official title of
units at group-level and above according to AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. Use HQ as part
of the mailing address when corresponding with staff elements at MAJCOM and HQ USAF
organizations. Do not use the term HQ when corresponding with the office of the commander,
vice commander, or chief of staff.
EXAMPLE:
Complete Mailing Address for 8th Air Force Logistics, Barksdale AFB LA
                   HQ 8 AF A4/A7
                   245 DAVIS AVE RM 100
                   BARKSDALE AFB LA 71110-2280
9.4. Functional Area Responsibilities.
   9.4.1. Technical Architecture (HQ AFCA/EAL). HQ AFCA/EAL develops, manages, and
   provides guidance for the address directory. It creates accounts for MAJCOM, FOA, and
   DRU address managers, and it may create accounts for base-level address representatives,
   when necessary. It also examines address data for consistency.
   9.4.2. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU Communications and Information (SC) Staffs.
   Headquarters SC staffs appoint address managers and inform HQ AFCA/EAL of address
   manager appointments.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                           53


   9.4.3. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU Address Managers (MAJCOM Rep). These managers
   implement and monitor the system within their command or agency. They are responsible for
   addresses of units assigned to the respective MAJCOM. They verify that addresses are
   correct and may add, change, or delete addresses. They also create accounts for base-level
   address representatives.
   9.4.4. Base-Level Address Representatives (Base Rep). These representatives are
   responsible for addresses of units on the respective base including tenant units. They may
   add, change, or delete addresses. They enter address information consistent with data entry
   instructions.
9.5. System Data Maintenance.
   9.5.1. Minimum Address Records. At a minimum, the address directory must contain all
   addresses for Air Force activities that receive official mail at a separate address and Air
   Force activities that have a unique PLA. Do not include sensitive addresses.
   9.5.2. Requesting Address Updates. Organizations should contact the respective Base Rep to
   request address updates. The organization should contact the respective MAJCOM Rep if
   there is no Base Rep.
   9.5.3. Address Fields:
      9.5.3.1. Organization Field (Required). Contains the name of the organization written in
      its entirety. For example, use 35TH FIGHTER WING versus 35 FW; AIR FORCE
      PENTAGON COMMUNICATIONS AGENCY versus AFPCA. Use Arabic numerals to
      designate units up to and including wings, and add th, d or st to the number. Spell out the
      number for numbered air forces; for example, 19TH LOGISTICS GROUP, and NINTH
      AIR FORCE. The term ―Headquarters‖ is a part of the official title of units at group-level
      and above. Use ―Headquarters‖ as part of the organization name with staff elements at
      MAJCOM and HQ USAF organizations; do not use ―Headquarters‖ as part of the
      organization name with the office of the commander, vice commander, or chief of staff.
      9.5.3.2. Abbreviation Field (Required). Contains the abbreviated name of the
      organization. Use standard abbreviations and office symbols (see Air Force Address
      Directory, Abbreviations page). Use Arabic numerals for all numbered organizations.
      Abbreviate ―Headquarters‖ as ―HQ.‖ For example use 35 FW versus 35TH FIGHTER
      WING; AFPCA versus AIR FORCE PENTAGON COMMUNICATIONS AGENCY; 9
      AF versus NINTH AIR FORCE.
      9.5.3.3. MAJCOM Field (Required). Contains the abbreviation of the MAJCOM to
      which the organization reports. Do not duplicate the abbreviation of the organization in
      this field unless the organization is the headquarters of the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU.
      9.5.3.4. Site Field (Required). Contains the name of the Air Force base, military
      installation, or city where the organization resides. For example: KIRTLAND AFB or

                                          Chapter 10

         STANDARD OFFICE SYMBOLS AND STANDARD ORGANIZATION
                           ABBREVIATIONS

10.1. Standard Office Symbols. Office symbols identify the organization structure and
functional responsibility of an office. Major functions have two-letter symbols, e.g., surgeon--
SG. Since basic functions report to major functions, basic functions have three-letter (or more)
symbols, e.g., dental--SGD. A basic function‘s office symbol starts with the same letters as the
parent function‘s office symbol, and adds one more letter.
   10.1.1. An office symbol used within only one MAJCOM or FOA is a command-unique
   office symbol. Note: For office symbols used in the Manpower data system to reflect
   organization structure, sometimes referred to as Organization Structures Codes, command
   unique office symbols are being phased out in most cases and most office symbol will
   become an Air Force standard symbol in that system.
   10.1.2. An office symbol used by more than one MAJCOM is a standard office symbol.
   Standard office symbols simplify addressing, effectively express organization function, and
   allow writers to communicate across the Air Force. The list of standard office symbols is
   maintained in the Air Force Address Directory (see Chapter 9).
10.2. Standard Unit Designation Abbreviations. The list of standard unit designation
abbreviations is maintained in the Air Force Address Directory. See AFPD 38-5, Unit
Designations, for guidance on requesting and/or changing unit designations themselves.
10.3. Unit Designation Abbreviation and Office Symbol Use. Use approved unit designation
abbreviations and office symbols on correspondence, messages, forms, etc. When addressing an
office, add the numerical designation and organization abbreviation before the office symbol,
and separate the two with a virgule (e.g., 375 LRS/LGR or HQ ACC/A6). Emphasize the use of
CC for organizational commanders. (Note: While command relationship must be stressed at
base-level, communications between MAJCOM and HQ USAF functional entities, particularly
messages, need to use functional office symbols [e.g., A4, A6, A7, etc.]. Never use both symbols
on the same communication [e.g., the contracting squadron commander can use either CC when
acting as a unit commander or LGC to represent the functional role as chief of contracting]).
10.4. Assigning Office Symbols.
   10.4.1. The official list of standard office symbols is maintained in the Air Force address
   directory (see Chapter 9). Standard office symbols are based on AFI 38-101 and
   departmental directives issued by HQ USAF that outline organizational and functional
   structure. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs provide lists of
   command-unique office symbols to HQ AFCA/EAL. When possible, office symbols share
   the same letters and titles at HQ USAF, MAJCOM, and base-level (with the exception of A-
   staff office symbols that are used mainly in HQ USAF, MAJCOM headquarters, Numbered
   Air Force headquarters and Component Headquarters organizations).
   10.4.2. Each major function within the Air Force is assigned a two-letter office symbol;
   wing staff, group, and squadrons within the operations group and mission support group will
   have two-letter office symbols. Basic functions are assigned three-letter (or more) office
 56                                            AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


   symbols. Some major functions include basic functions that are similar in title and function
   to another major function (e.g., the major function of manpower and personnel, A1, may
   have a basic function of plans). Since all office symbols within a function must start with the
   same two letters, the personnel plans function should use the office symbol A1X rather than
   XP so that the basic function is not confused with a major function.
   10.4.3. The Chief of Staff has approved a standardized A-staff structure for use in applicable
   HQ USAF, MAJCOM headquarters, Numbered Air Force headquarters and Component
   Headquarters organizations. This is patterned on the J-staff structure used in joint
   organizations and is designed to improve communication within the Air Force and with other
   DoD organizations. Functions not covered by the standardized A-staff structure maintain
   their current office symbols (e.g., FM, JA, SG, PA, etc.). Base-level organizations do not use
   A-staff office symbols. To vary from this, requires Air Force functionals to request approval
   from HQ USAF/A1 and SAF/XC. Major A-staff break-outs are shown below. Standardized
   A-staff symbols below this level are shown in the Air Force Address Directory:
10.5. Functional Area Responsibilities.
   10.5.1. SAF/XCPP establishes communications and information policy, ensures procedures
   are established, and approves new, and changes to, standard office symbols and standard unit
   designation abbreviations.
   10.5.2. HQ AFCA/EAL maintains the official lists of standard office symbols and standard
   unit designation abbreviations. It provides guidance for the system.
   10.5.3. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs, HQ USAF/A1MO, and
   HQ USAF major functions may propose new command-unique or standard office symbols.
   Send requests to HQ AFCA/EAL. AFCA/EAL coordinates with HQ USAF/A1MO and HQ
   USAF major functions to establish new command-unique or standard office symbols.
       10.5.4. Do not use proposed new command-unique or standard office symbols until
       approved through the appropriate channels.
10.6. Requesting Office Symbols and Unit Designation Abbreviations.
   10.6.1. Since titles can be misleading, organizations must request office symbols and unit
   designation abbreviations from their local communications and information staffs. Requests
   must include functional statements, organizational charts, and whenever possible, proposed
   office symbols. Organizations must use current standard office symbols or command-unique
   office symbols when they reorganize. Once approved, organizations will include the old
   office symbol with the new office symbol when announcing reorganizations.
   10.6.2. Requests involving an organizational change request (e.g., unit activation,
   inactivation, re-designation, or variation to a standard organization) will follow request
   procedures established in AFI 38-101.
   10.6.3. Local communications and information staffs must coordinate requests with
   MAJCOM communications and information staffs before assigning new office symbols and
   abbreviations. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs establish
   procedures for coordinating and establishing new command-unique office symbols. Do not
   create command-unique office symbols that duplicate or conflict with standard office
   symbols.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                         57


   10.6.4. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs inform HQ AFCA/EAL
   when establishing new command-unique office symbols and abbreviations, and provide
   current lists of command-unique office symbols.
   10.6.5. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs, HQ USAF/A1MO, and
   HQ USAF major functions may propose new, or changes to, standard office symbols and
   standard unit designation abbreviations (see Figure 10.1).

Figure 10.1. Office Symbol/Abbreviation Change Process.




      10.6.5.1. Organizations submit requests for new/changes to standard office symbols to
      HQ AFCA/EAL. Organizations at HQ USAF-level may submit requests directly to
      AFCA. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs must obtain
      coordination from the respective MAJCOM Manpower, Organization and Resources
      (A1M) office and appropriate MAJCOM major function. Organizations below
      MAJCOM-level must obtain MAJCOM concurrence, via a source document, prior to
      submission to AFCA. Requests involving an organizational change request (e.g., unit
      activation, inactivation, redesignation, or variation to a standard organization) follows
      procedures established in AFI 38-101.
         10.6.5.2. HQ AFCA/EAL coordinates requests to establish new standard office
         symbols and standard unit designation abbreviations with HQ USAF/A1MO, the
 58                                           AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


          appropriate HQ USAF major functions, and obtains approval from SAF/XCPP. HQ
          AFCA/EAL updates the official lists of standard office symbols and standard unit
          designation abbreviations after receiving approval from SAF/XCPP.
      10.6.6. Organizations will not use office symbols and organization abbreviations until
      approved through the appropriate channels.

      DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE SEAL, COAT OF ARMS, AND CREST

Note: Refer questions about this attachment to Air Force Historical Research Agency
(AFHRA/RS), 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
A2.1. Functional Area Responsibilities.
   A2.1.1. Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. The Administrative Assistant to the
   Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/AA) is the custodian of the Air Force Seal (Figure A2.1)
   and is solely responsible for approving the use of its impression on official departmental
   documents and records.

Figure A2.1. Department of the Air Force Seal.




   A2.1.2. AFHRA approves use of facsimiles of the seal. This includes use on insignia, flags,
   medals, and similar items. AFHRA also approves requests from industry or Air Force groups
   for use of other parts of the seal.
   A2.1.3. Policy and Compliance Division. The Secretary of the Air Force, Policy and
   Compliance Division (SAF/XCPP) approves the manner in which the seal is used on printed
   material.
A2.2. Description and Significance. The official Air Force colors of ultramarine blue (Pantone
Matching System [PMS] Reflex Blue) and Air Force yellow (PMS 116) are used prominently on
the Air Force seal (see AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry). The seal is
described as follows:
   A2.2.1. A circular disc of ultramarine blue edged with a narrow Air Force yellow border.
       A2.2.1.1. Centered on the disc, the Air Force coat of arms, consisting of the crest and
       shield.
       A2.2.1.2. The crest is made up of the eagle, wreath, and cloud form. The American bald
       eagle symbolizes the United States and its air power and is depicted in its natural colors.
       The wreath under the eagle is made up of six alternate folds of metal and light blue. This
       repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The white clouds behind the eagle denote
       the start of a new sky.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                            65


       A2.2.1.3. The shield, directly below the eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into
       two parts by a nebular line representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow
       thunderbolt with flames in natural color that shows striking power through the use of
       aerospace. The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with three
       natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning
       bolts. The background of the top part is light blue representing the sky. The lower part is
       white representing metal silver.
   A2.2.2. The 13 white encircling stars represent the original 13 colonies.
   A2.2.3. The Air Force yellow numerals under the shield are 1947. This is the year the
   Department of the Air Force was established.
   A2.2.4. The band encircling the whole design is white edged in Air Force yellow with black
   lettering. The inscriptions read ―Department of the Air Force‖ on the top part and ―United
   States of America‖ on the lower part.
A2.3. Using the Seal. The seal is permitted only as outlined in this attachment. Falsely making,
forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering the seal, or knowingly using or possessing with
fraudulent intent is punishable by law (Title 18 U.S.C. § 506). Displaying the seal is allowed in
certain instances. Commanders make sure the display is in good taste and appropriate to the
occasion.
   A2.3.1. Authorized Users. Commanders of MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, Air Force missions,
   military assistance advisory groups, air attaches, professors of aerospace studies, and Air
   Force general officers may use the Air Force seal in the performance of their official duties.
   Museums may use the seal when specifically authorized by AFHRA.
   A2.3.2. Authorized Uses. You may use the seal or any part of it--in black and white, color
   monochrome reproduction, pictorial, or sculptured relief--as follows:
       A2.3.2.1. On printing issued at departmental-level for general Air Force use.
       A2.3.2.2. In official Air Force films, videotapes, or television programs.
       A2.3.2.3. On programs, certificates, diplomas, invitations, and greetings of an official
       nature.
       A2.3.2.4. On memorials or monuments erected or approved by the Department of the Air
       Force.
       A2.3.2.5. With any official Air Force exhibit.
       A2.3.2.6. On wall plaques at Air Force facilities with the approval of the appropriate
       commander or agency chief.
   A2.3.3. Unauthorized Uses. The seal will not be used in any way that implies Air Force use
   or endorsement of an item. For example:
       A2.3.3.1. Air Force property and equipment for identification.
       A2.3.3.2. Souvenir or novelty items.

                           COLLECTIVE ADDRESS LIST (AL)

A3.1. Address List (AL) Management. An AL is an abbreviated name for a group of
addresses used frequently for organizational messaging. Represented by a number or title, the
AL must contain a membership of 30 or more DMS distinguished names (DN). An AL must
have a list of predetermined permitted users. Use ALs to reduce the number of DMS DNs in the
message headings and to increase the speed of message transmission.
   A3.1.1. SAF/XCDP has functional authority over the management of the DMS-AF Address
   List Program. SAF/XCDP has delegated authority as the Air Force Control Authority for
   ALs to Headquarters 754 Electronic Systems Group (HQ 754 ELSG/DOX), 501 E. Moore
   Drive, Building 884, Room 1000, Maxwell AFB Gunter Annex AL 36114-3004. Initial
   requests for AL assignments must be sent via signed and encrypted DMS message to
   ―OU=HQ754ELSG DMS AF PLA Managers(UC), L=MAXWELL AFB GUNTER ANNEX
   AL,OU=ORGANIZATIONS,OU=AF,OU=DOD,O=U.S. GOVERNMENT,C=US‖. If you
   are using the ML Manager Tool to modify or update existing ALs, the script file must be sent
   via signed and encrypted DMS message to the Mail List Support Center, ―OU=Mail List
   Support Center(uc),OU=Mail Lists,OU=AF,OU=DOD,O=U.S. GOVERNMENT, C=US‖.
       A3.1.1.1. Request for AL establishment should include: a point of contact (AL owner),
       the organization‘s addresses (DMS DN, PLA, and mailing address), purpose of the DMS
       AL, the highest message classification of the AL, estimated frequency of use, list of AL
       members (must be at least 30 members), and permitted users. Justification: This is the
       only information needed for approval or disapproval of AL establishment.
   A3.1.2. The AL manager is the agency responsible for the assignment and control of ALs.
   HQ 754 ELSG/DOX assigns Air Force ALs to the AL managers of HQ USAF, MAJCOMs,
   and FOAs. MAJCOM and FOA representatives, as command agency or agency AL
   managers, are responsible for assignment and control of AL blocks within their command.
   They may allocate ALs to their intermediate command representatives, who act as sub-
   command AL managers. Within their area of responsibility and for those ALs they control,
   AL managers will:
       A3.1.2.1. Receive, check, and approve or disapprove requests for AL assignments,
       modifications, and cancellations. Ensure no duplication of membership is accomplished
       without approval from the AL control authority.
       A3.1.2.2. Issue AL numbers to requesting authorities.
       A3.1.2.3. Maintain a file of all AL requests for promulgation, modification, and
       cancellation until no longer needed. Keep a current list of AL assignments. The list will
       contain each AL number, its originating authority, complete mailing address, a point-of-
       contact, telephone number (DSN or commercial), purpose, highest classification, and
       precedence for use.
   A3.1.3. The Air Force Mail List System Center (MLSC) is responsible for implementing and
   maintaining the Air Force ALs, with the exception of Headquarters Air Force (HAF)-
   assigned ALs. The Air Force MLSC creates, posts, modifies, and deletes Air Force ALs in
   the Air Force DMS DIT with approval from the AL managers. The Pentagon
70                                           AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


  Telecommunications System Center creates, posts, modifies, and deletes HAF-assigned ALs
  with approval from SAF/XCDP
  A3.1.4. The AL manager assigns the AL and responsibility for its use and administration to
  the originating authority (holder) for the AL. AL managers will:
     A3.1.4.1. Assign only ALs that are needed and ensure membership compositions are
     kept current.
     A3.1.4.2. Ensure the permitted users are designated for ALs assigned.
     A3.1.4.3. Sequentially number modifications following the recapitulation that consists
     only of address additions, deletions, and changes.
     A3.1.4.4. Cancel an AL by identifying ALs that are no longer needed and publishing a
     notice that terminates their use. The AL manager keeps canceled ALs and includes the
     statement, ―AL XXXX is retained for future assignment by MAJCOM/FOA‖ in the
     cancellation notice.
     A3.1.4.5. Recapitulations of an AL consist of publishing an accurately revised total
     membership composition. Do this at least once a year when numerous modifications are
     made. All recapitulations should include a restatement of the information provided by the
     promulgation (purpose, classification information, and permitted users).
     A3.1.4.6. Send promulgations, modifications, cancellations, or recapitulations of ALs to
     SAF/XCDP, HQ 754 ELSG/DOX, and/or the United States Army Information
     Technology Agency, Room 2C654, The Pentagon, 9000 Defense Pentagon, Washington
     DC 20301-9000, for information purposes. All promulgation, recapitulation,
     modification, and cancellation messages for the legacy AIGs must be accomplished using
     the USMTF F300 Collective format. Refer to the Allied Communications Publication
     (ACP) 100, USSUPP 2, Instructions for Collective Addressing Management for Legacy
     and Defense Message System, for further guidance on the management of AIGs and
     USMTF templates. Refer to Attachment 7 to obtain the Defense Information
     Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE) software for the USMTF
     templates.
     A3.1.4.7. Maintain a record of promulgations, modifications, recapitulations, and
     cancellations in accordance with local regulations. When addressees are added to the
     composition by modification, provide new members a copy of the promulgation or last
     recapitulation and any modifications that were issued.
     A3.1.4.8. After an AL has been established, send the first message to the AL to
     promulgate its existence, purpose, the authorized users, the composition, and whether it is
     classified. Message test should contain: DN address of member of the composition, DN
     of the cognizant authority (owning organization), AL POC (including commercial and
     DSN phone number and E-mail address), AL classification, and statement of purpose.
  A3.1.5. Subordinate commands, activities, or components will request ALs by E-mail or
  sending a memorandum to the local AL manager. Requests should include:
     A3.1.5.1. Identification of the command, activity, organization, and originating
     authority.
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                            71


      A3.1.5.2. Description, classification, purpose, and classification of the AL.
      A3.1.5.3. Estimated frequency of use.
      A3.1.5.4. Proposed list of DMS addresses of the members, permitted users, and the
      classification of the address composition.
   A3.1.6. Use activities listed in the directory services database for the address composition of
   ALs. In addition:
      A3.1.6.1. ALs with less than 30 addresses are not authorized without an approved
      waiver.
      A3.1.6.2. Use two and three letter office symbols when selecting the members of the AL
      from the DMS DIT.
      A3.1.6.3. Collective address designators, such as ALMAJCOM, are not authorized
      within an AL. They may be included as an additional addressee of the message.
      A3.1.6.4. Do not include addressees of other nations, such as International Pact
      Organizations, non-DoD, or DoD addressees served by non-DoD Base Communications
      Centers. You may include Allied or NATO message addressees only as add-on
      addressees. Only DMS DNs can be included in an AL; all other non-DMS addresses must
      be listed as add-on addresses.
   A3.1.7. Only the originating authority and those activities designated by the originating
   authority as a permitted user may use an AL. The following applies:
      A3.1.7.1. When an AL is authorized, message originators must put their organizational
      address in the ―from‖ element of the message.
      A3.1.7.2. All members to an AL are action addressees.
      A3.1.7.3. When two or more ALs are used and an addressee is listed in more than one
      AL, duplicate delivery will occur.
      A3.1.7.4. Add-on addressees may not know the address composition of the addressed
      ALs. If the originator thinks this information is important to the add-on addressees, the
      originator provides them the address list on request.
      A3.1.7.5. Air Force MLSC is not responsible for providing the composition of an AL to
      an addressee; refer such requests to the AL owner or manager.
   A3.1.8. Do not readdress AL messages, except in operational emergencies, unless the
   readdressing action is to addressees not included in the original transmission. If the
   operational urgency of the subject does not allow time for an AL address composition
   review, then readdress the message with add-on addressees.
   A3.1.9. Addressees inform the originating authority by memorandum or DMS message if
   they determine they no longer need to be included in an AL or if their titles or addresses
   change.
A3.2. Categorical Addresses.
   A3.2.1. These addresses are used by an activity when corresponding with its subordinate
   units. They are either for a single type of unit (e.g., ―All USAFE Wings‖ or ―All ACC
 72                                         AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010


   Military Personnel Flights‖) or a combination of units (e.g., ―All ACC Numbered Air Forces
   and the 1st Fighter Wing‖). When established, include categorical addresses in supplements
   to this manual for easy reference.
   A3.2.2. The following categorical addresses are established for use only by HQ USAF, SAF
   and MAJCOMS.
       A3.2.2.1. AL ALMAJCOM – Is sent to all MAJCOM/CC/CV/CS/DS offices only: for
       example, AL ALMAJCOM.
       A3.2.2.2. AL ALMAJCOM-FOA – Is sent to all MAJCOMs, FOAs, and
       DRUs/CC/CV/CS/DS offices only: for example, AL ALMAJCOM-FOA.
NOTE: To add selected FOAs to the distribution of an ALMAJCOM memorandum, list those
FOAs after ALMAJCOM in the ―TO‖ element of a memorandum: for example, ALMAJCOM
AFISC AFAA (Manpower).

   CHECKLIST FOR SENDING DEFENSE MESSAGE SYSTEM (DMS) MESSAGES

A4.1. Format. Messages must be in Plain Text format if going to an AUTODIN Plain
Language Address (PLA). It is always best to prepare messages in Plain Text format from
Outlook as a ―new message‖ or in Notepad. According to DoD policy, messages addressed to
PLAs should be in USMTF/ Joint Message Processor (JMP) format. Start by double-clicking on
the JMP icon on your Outlook toolbar (you may have to click the arrow on the far right side of
toolbar to view more icons). Select USMTF-2001 from the Message Table window that comes
up. Select ―GENADMIN‖ or other messages format from the Message Selection window, as
applicable.
   A4.1.1. Do not use Word as the editor for a DMS message if you are going to send it to a
   PLA. Once drafted in Word, special characters are attached, that causes the message to be
   rejected when it reaches AUTODIN. If the message body was already drafted in Word, do
   the following to convert it for AUTODIN:
       A4.1.1.1. First, save the document as text only.
       A4.1.1.2. Open the document in Notepad.
       A4.1.1.3. Copy all contents and paste onto a new blank message form.
       A4.1.1.4. On the menu bar under ―Format,‖ select Encoding -> More -> Unicode (UTF-
       7).
       A4.1.1.5. Verify that all message syntax is correct.
A4.2. Addresses. You may select both DMS and PLA addresses in the same message.
   A4.2.1. From address: Always select from the GAL.
   A4.2.2. To address: Select only DMS addresses from your PAB.
   A4.2.3. Mail Lists: You must be an authorized user; see mail list owner for permission.
A4.3. Subject. Start with the classification of the subject in parenthesis: (U) for
UNCLASSIFIED, (C) for CONFIDENTIAL, or (S) for SECRET; i.e., ―(U) Some Subject‖.
   A4.3.1. Classification options are determined by the security clearance level of the network
   the DMS client is connected to. These options are specific to the assigned role of the user.
   Some FORTEZZA cards do not contain all classifications, and errors will occur after sending
   a message if the message contained an invalid classification. To determine what
   classifications are available on the card for each role, locate the ―KEA Clearances‖ section
   under the particular role on the personal identification number letter issued with the card.
A4.4. Message Body. Enter the security classification in the first line of the message:
UNCLAS, C O N F I D E N T I A L, or S E C R E T. Spaces are required between each letter
for CONFIDENTIAL or SECRET. This is the highest classification of the contents of the
message.
   A4.4.1. Enter declassification instructions in the last line of the message for all classified
   messages.

   chosen for the attribute, and that the operator is ―Contains.‖ Then type the PLA name into the
   ―Value‖ box (see Figure A5.10). Only part of the name need be used if the full name of the
   PLA is unknown. The search results show all entries in the level that contain the value that
   was used in the search.

   A5.3.7. Once you have entered the value, click on ―Check Filter.‖ Then click ―OK,‖ and
   then ―OK‖ again.
   A5.3.8. When the search has completed, a list of all DIT entries in that level that contain the
   search value are displayed. The number of entries returned is less with a more specific search
   value (see Figure A5.11).

   A5.3.9. Search the returned results until the desired PLA is found. Click on the PLA and
   make sure it is highlighted. Then click on the icon shown in Figure A5.11 to add that entry
   to your PAB.
   A5.3.10. Adding a DMS address to the PAB is similar to adding an address to an AUTODIN
   message. Because the number of addresses under each other level of the tree is considerably
   less than that of the AUTODIN PLAs-level, the search function is not required. Simply
   expand each section in the path to the desired DIT entry.
   A5.3.11. Most DMS addresses used are found below the Air Force-level of the DIT. To add
   the DMS address from the DIT, expand the DIT tree to the Air Force-level. Under the Air
   Force-level, near the end of the list, are other levels breaking up all Air Force DMS entries
   into functional areas. Each Air Force entity is found under one of these levels. Most bases are
   found under the Organization‘s level. A little practice with the DIT structure will build the
   familiarity needed to use the DIT with ease.
   A5.3.12. To add a DMS address, simply expand the levels down until you see the desired
   base where the address is located. Within each base is the organizations and their
   corresponding sections.
      A5.3.12.1. Once the address is located, click on it to highlight it, and then click on the
      icon shown in Figure A5.12 to add it to the PAB.

       A5.3.12.2. Modify the display name of the DMS entry in the PAB to include the
       organization, if required.
A5.4. Adding Office Symbols to Plain Language Addresses (PLA). If the message is sent to
an office through AUTODIN, add that office symbol to the address before the message is sent.
   A5.4.1. To do this, open up the address book. Make sure that PAB is selected in the ―Show
   names from the‖ box. Then click on the PLA address that requires the office symbol and
   open the properties for that address (see Figure A5.13).

   that immediately follows the ―DDA:ACP-PLAD=‖ text (see Figure A5.14).
   A5.4.5. Begin adding the office symbol by typing in four virgules (////). Add the office
   symbol. If there is more than one symbol to add, separate each office symbol with two
   virgules (//). When all office symbols are added, type in four more virgules (////). The entry
   should appear similar to Figure A5.15

                                           Attachment 7
        UNITED STATES MESSAGE TEXT FORMAT (USMTF) PREPARATION

Note: The OPR for this attachment is the Global Cyberspace Integration Center (GCIC)
(http://www.gcic.af.mil/).
A7.1. Introduction. This attachment provides the basic rules for USMTF messages. It is not
intended to give specific procedures for drafting and distributing all USMTFs. All messages
(USMTF and General Service) have a heading, text, and ending. The heading and ending formats
for preparing USMTF messages are the same as AUTODIN messages (see Chapter 7). The text
or body of the message is the only portion covered by USMTF rules. The
https://disain.disa.mil/usmtf/ web site provides specific guidance on preparing the text of a
USMTF message. Using software preparation aids such as the DII COE Message Processor is
recommended for complex USMTFs. The DII COE Message Processor is a jointly developed
standard software package with various output capabilities to produce an error-free USMTF.
This includes the capability to create a message on a Standard Automated Remote to AUTODIN
Host disk. The USMTF program objective enhances joint and combat effectiveness through
standardization of message formats, data elements, and information exchange procedures.
USMTFs result in the services using the same messages with the same information content.
USMTFs thus provide commanders a common message format and common language--both
indispensable to successful joint operations.
A7.2. United States Message Text Format (USMTF) Text Components.
   A7.2.1. Set. The set is the basic building block of all USMTF messages. A set is like a
   sentence. It contains information about one subject. The set name tells the reader (and the
   computer) what information is in the set.
   A7.2.2. Field. The field is the basic building block of a set. A set is made up of words. If the
   field has a descriptor, it describes the information in the field.
   A7.2.3. Linear Set. Fields arranged in a line across the page form a linear set.
   A7.2.4. Columnar Set. Fields arranged in columns (like columns of numbers in a table) form
   a columnar set.
   A7.2.5. Free-Text Set. Free-text set allows use of ―plain language‖ in a formatted message.
   Write free-text set entries in lines, columns, sentences, or paragraph. Use whatever form is
   best to get your idea across. Use free-text sets to give additional details or information that
   does not fit into linear or columnar sets.
   A7.2.6. Authorized Entry/Authorized Entry Code. Only use authorized entry codes in some
   fields. See http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/brochure/usmtf.pdf for guidance. These entries are
   often abbreviations.
   A7.2.7. Heading. Some sets are grouped under headings. These headings divide the message
   into several parts. Each part is a separate topic within the message.
A7.3. Allowable Characters. Ninety-eight characters are available for use in USMTF
messages. They are, by type, 26 alphabetic characters [A through Z], 10 numeric characters [0
through 9], 6 special characters [ . , - ( ) ? ], the colon [:], the field marker [ / ], the space [or
AFMAN33-326_45SWSUP_I 3 AUGUST 2010                                                              89


blank] character, 26 lowercase letters [ a through z ], 3 nonprinting American Standard Code
for Information Interchange control codes [horizontal tab, carriage return, line feed], and 26
extended special characters [ ! @ # $ % ^ & * = _ + [ ] { } \“ „ ; < > ~ ` | ]. Message drafters
should refer to https://DISAIN.DISA.mil/USMTF since some of these characters have
restricted uses.
A7.4. Special Symbols.
   A7.4.1. Field Marker. A single virgule (/) indicates the start of a field. It takes up one
   character space, and goes before the field entry and on the same line with the first field entry.
   A7.4.2. End-of-Set Marker. A double virgule (//) indicates the end of a set. It takes up two
   character spaces, and both virgules must be on the same line. If a set ends on the last or next
   to last space in a line, put the // at the beginning of the next line. Do not use the // for
   anything other than an end-of-set marker.
   A7.4.3. No Data Sign. The no data sign is a hyphen (-). Use it when a field entry is required
   but the information is unknown or not available. For example:
       A7.4.3.1. A field designated as a mandatory field must contain an entry, even if the entry
       is only a no data sign.
       A7.4.3.2. A no data sign must be entered in a conditional or optional field if another field
       further along in the same set has an entry.
A7.5. Segment-Set-Field Usage Categories. All segments, sets, and fields have usage
categories of mandatory, conditional, or optionally determined. These categories specify if the
segment, set, or field must contain an entry. Website https://DISAIN.DISA.mil/USMTF lists
the category for each segment, set, and field in the message.
A7.6. Message Preparation. Follow the instructions in Attachment 6 to fill out the heading
and ending (addressees, classification, etc.). Begin the first line of the USMTF text on the next
line below the last element used for the heading from Attachment 6. Type the first letter or
special character for each line of text flush with the left margin, with a maximum of 69
characters on any line. Each USMTF message begins with a combination of the following initial
sets. Use them in the order listed.
   A7.6.1. EXER or OPER (EXERcise or OPERation). For daily routine message traffic,
   neither set is used.
   A7.6.2. MSGID (MeSsaGe ID). A mandatory set. It tells the reader which format to expect
   for the message and conveys information about the subject of the message.
   A7.6.3. REF (REFerence). Identifies to the reader any previous communications or
   correspondence that affect the message. If no material is being referenced, this set is not
   used.
   A7.6.4. AMPN (AMPlificatioN). Used to amplify the previous REF set. If no amplification
   of the previous REF set is required, this set is not used.
   A7.6.5. NARR (NARRative). Used to provide information about previously used REF and
   AMPN sets. If no additional information about the previous sets is necessary, this set is not
   used.

A7.7. Rules and Complex Structure. Numerous rules and complex structure of USMTFs
require the message drafter to use https://DISAIN.DISA.mil/USMTF or USMTF certified
message processor. Formatting errors defeat the purpose of the USMTF program.
A7.8. General Messages. The following USMTFs are general administrative messages:
   A7.8.1. AKNLDG (AcKNowLeDGe). Used to acknowledge receipt of a message and to
   indicate planned or accomplished action. Transmittal of the message implies understanding
   of the received message.
   A7.8.2. GENADMIN (GENeral ADMINistrative). Used to pass administrative information.
   It is intended to allow reporting information not yet accommodated by other USMTF
   messages and is not intended for use in place of the existing USMTF messages.
   A7.8.3. MSGCORRN (MeSsaGe CORRectioN/cancellation). Used by the originator to
   cancel a message or add, delete, or replace information contained in a previously transmitted
   message.
   A7.8.4. RI (Request for Information). Used to request information from other units.
   A7.8.5. RRI (Response to Request for Information). Used to reply to requests for
   information.
   A7.8.6. VISITREQ (VISIT REQuest). Used to request authorization to visit another
   command or organization for a specified purpose.
A7.9. Certified Common Operating Environment (COE) Message Processor
Software. There are three software applications certified for AUTODIN, DMS, DII COE, and
USMTF. One is a Government-off-the-shelf product, and two are commercial-off-the-shelf
products. Links to the sites for these products and other USMTF information are available
through AFC2ISRC/A6G web page at https://afc2isrc.af.mil/warfighter/divisions/SCG/.

Note: Distribution E is for Cape Canaveral AFS Commander‘s use only. It is reserved for use by
the Det 1, 45 MSG/CC to disseminate vital/urgent information to all occupants at Cape Canaveral
AFS. It will not be used in conjunction with any other categorical address nor by any OPR at
Patrick AFB.

CONTRACTORS. There is no individual or automatic distribution scheme for contractors. To
provide distribution to a contractor, you must make the distribution individually by placing desired
number of copies in a SF 65, or envelope and address it to the specific contractor. SF 65s or
envelopes are then given to the Official Mail Center (OMC) for distribution to the contractor.

DISTRIBUTION. Notification of changes to the categorical address listing will be in
memorandum format to 45 SCS/SCOKD.
