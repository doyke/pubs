Made minor changes to Attachment 2, DD Form 1149 Checklist; and minor format changes to
Attachment 4, Shipping and Receiving Authorization Letter Template.
1. Purpose. To regulate non-automated shipments (shipments via DD Form 1149), and ensure
applicable base program managers approve movement of critical commodities off the
installation. The DD Form 1149 may be accessed at the Logistics Support Office SharePoint
page (https://lsotools.wpafb.af.mil/dd1149/). Use of DD Form 1149 Shipment Checklist is
mandated.
2. Prohibited Items. Use of non-automated shipments (via DD Form 1149) to transfer or ship
items maintained on accountable records is strictly prohibited without prior coordination and as
applicable, major command (MAJCOM) approval as indicated by the DD Form 1149 Shipment
Checklist. Some examples are; Expendability Recoverability Reparability Cost Designator
(ERRCD) ND, NF, or XD Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM);
nuclear weapons-related materiel; Communications Security assets; serialized controlled items;
reparable/Due-in From Maintenance (DIFM); and small arms/weapons.
3. Exemptions. The following items are exempt and do not require completion of the DD Form
1149 Shipment Checklist:
     3.1. Documents/papers, test samples (e.g., fuel, oil, soil, medical, etc.).
     3.2. Real-world and exercise deployment and redeployment accountable equipment or
     materiel (e.g., Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (MRSP), contents of Internal
     Airlift/Helicopter Slingable-Container Unit/mobility containers and 463L pallets). Note:
     Deployment materiel such as MRSP and equipment that is required to be put into deployed
     status must be reviewed by LRS Equipment Accountability Office prior to shipment. Assets
     not part of the initial shipment (follow-on or reach back support) must be approved by
     MAJCOM prior to shipment via DD Form 1149.
     3.3. Targeting pod (NSN 1270-01-418-1626) and Navigation pod (NSN 5885-01-435-2772).
     3.4. Items on DIFM details awaiting GOLDFLAG (AFREP) return and repair from contract
     maintenance. Clearly identify AFREP assets on the DD Form 1149.
     3.5. Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) is required to be shipped via
     DD Form 1149. Clearly identify TMDE assets on the DD Form 1149.
     3.6. Royal Singapore Air Force assets not on USAF accountable records.
     3.7. Shipment requests via DD Form 1149 for personnel on temporary duty here at Mountain
     Home AFB.
4. DD Form 1149 Checklist. The 366th Logistics Readiness Squadron’s SharePoint page
(https://mountainhome.eim.acc.af.mil/366fw/msg/lrs/default.aspx) contains the DD Form
1149 Shipment Checklist under the "Frequently Used Forms" tab. The requester will complete
the DD Form 1149 Shipment Checklist and coordinate it through appropriate base agencies as
identified on the checklist (refer to Attachment 2, DD Form 1149 Checklist).
5. Procedures. Take the completed DD Form 1149 shipment checklist, DD Form 1149 with
authorized signature in block 10, and property to 366 LRS/LGRDDC (Outbound Freight
Section) for shipment. Recommend personnel completing a DD Form 1149 refer to AFI 24-203,

  5.1. Expendability Recoverability Reparability Code. Submitter must list the applicable
  Expendability Recoverability Reparability Code next to the nomenclature in block 4(b) of the
  DD Form 1149 for each item shipped. Also, annotate the equipment/Special Purpose
  Recoverables Authorized Maintenance detail document number if non-automated method of
  shipment is approved by MAJCOM managers (refer to Attachment 3, Sample DD Form
  1149).
  5.2. Shipping and Receiving Authorization Letter. Personnel must be authorized in
  writing by their squadron commander to sign block 10 of the DD Form 1149 (Attachment 4,

  DD Form 1149 when requesting expedited transportation (TP-1,999, MICAP). If the
