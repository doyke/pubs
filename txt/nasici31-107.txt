This instruction establishes policies and procedures governing the issuance, control and
connectivity of multi-function devices (MFDs) on the NASIC’s corporate networks (JWICS,
SIPRNET and NIPRNET) to comply with the security and operation standards in the Joint
DoDIIS/Cryptologic SCI Information Systems Security Standards, DoDD8500.1, Information
Assurance, and DoDI8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation. This publication applies to
all NASIC civilian and military personnel, contractors, as well as all Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) Units and Air National Guard (ANG) Units assigned to NASIC. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field to NASIC Publications Office (NASIC/SCOK), 4180 Watson Way,
Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5648 publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.                Contact
supporting records managers as required. The use of the name or mark of any specific
manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply
endorsement by the Air Force.

1. POLICY: All MFDs must meet network certification and accreditation, and TEMPEST
requirements.
   1.1. Use AF Form 3215, SC IT Requirements Document, (see NASICI 33-108), for all new
   requests for multi-function devices.
 2                                                              NASICI31-107 11 AUGUST 2010


     1.2. All MFDs must meet the same certification and accreditation requirements as the
     network they are installed on.
     1.2.1. All MFD will be labeled with the appropriate SF 710, SF 707 or SF 712, ADP Media
     Classification Labels, according to the level of classification printed, copied, scanned, etc. or
     network connection.
     1.3. MFDs connected to a NASIC network will process at the same accredited classification
     level as the network.
     1.4. MFDs will have all hard drives removed when removed from the facility. If Random
     Access Memory (RAM) is a part of the configuration, information stored in RAM must be
     purged when the device is unplugged.
     1.5. Phone line connections are prohibited.
     1.6. Modem chips will be removed and/or disabled to eliminate the possibility of
     transmitting both facsimiles and data.
2. APPLICABILITY: These procedures apply to all users of MFDs within the NASIC facility.
The facility is comprised of all NASIC spaces under the oversight of NASIC Information
Assurance Manager (IAM).
3. PROCEDURES:
     3.1. It is necessary to purchase MFDs outright (not lease them) in order to comply with
     security requirements, since these devices could have internal electronic memory
     components. Maintain absolute control of all electronic parts that contain a memory/data
     remanence capacity, and have a maintenance contract that provides for maintenance support
     by cleared personnel.
     3.2. Printed circuit boards/memory boards and components that could possibly contain
     residual information are to be destroyed as classified trash.
     3.3. All communications ports not specifically required for networked or contractual
     maintenance must be removed or permanently disabled. Only hardwired connections are
     permitted (no infrared, radio frequency, or audio communications). This provision must be
     included in the purchase contract.
     3.4. If laptops are required for diagnostics, the NASIC IAM must approve their purchase and
     be provided the means for securing these systems within NASIC facilities. Wireless is not
     authorized and only minimum software present to perform required diagnostics.
     3.5. Maintenance records will be maintained by maintenance contractors.
     3.6. MFDs have a scan/e-mail function that allows users to attach a document and send it via
     e-mail. The email is only authorized to be sent to the user performing this function. This
     function can replace faxing. To use this function, you must have an account on the network,
     which can be requested through the Communications Focal Point (CFP)/SCOS/71248/R2517
     or R2345.
     3.6.1. NIPRNET connected MFDs with scan/e-mail function will have a stop sign sticker
     attached to the CAC card reader (attached to the MFD) reminding users to perform a “two-
     person” check of the information before scanning.

4. RESPONSIBILITIES:
   4.1. The NASIC IAM, in conjunction with the DAAR, shall:
       4.1.1. Ensure MFDs installed in NASIC facilities have the appropriate certification and
       accreditation documentation and authorizations.
   4.2. Group Commander/Directors shall:
       4.2.1. Appoint equipment custodians as required by AFI 33-112, Information
       Technology Hardware Asset Management, who will ensure equipment is entered into the
       NASIC equipment inventory.
   4.3. The NASIC TEMPEST/EMSEC Manager shall:
       4.3.1. Ensure all MFDs meet the TEMPEST standards of AFISRA 33-203, Air Force
       Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency TEMPEST and Emission Security
       Program, and TEMPEST/1-92, National Security Telecommunications Information
       Systems Security Advisory Memorandum (NSTISSAM).
   4.4. Equipment Custodians shall:
       4.4.1. Ensure appropriate classification and usage labels are properly affixed to the
       equipment.
       4.4.2. Ensure MFDs are included in the NASIC equipment inventory.
Note: AFVA 205-9 (Classified Reproduction Rules) and AFVA 205-8 (Stop, Do Not Use This
Machine for Classified Reproduction Stop) have been RESCINDED.

Note: Monthly meter readings are not required for MFDs.
   4.5. Users shall:
       4.5.1. Report all IS security incidents to your Office Security Manager (OSM)/Staff
       Agency Security Manager (SASM) and the Security Office during duty hours and the
       Communications Focal Point after duty hours.
       4.5.2. Submit CFP Service Requests for all maintenance on MFDs (or call the
       Communications Focal Point, SCOS/71248/R2517 or R2345, Room 8292).
