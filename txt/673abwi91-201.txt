1. Procedures:
     1.1. The 673d Security Forces Squadron (673 SFS) Desk Sergeant, 773 CES Snow Barn, 3
     OSS Base Operations, and 3 OSS weather will notify the 673 ABW Command Post when
     adverse conditions affect safe travel to or from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (that is,
     earthquakes, volcano eruptions, adverse weather, or acts of nature). NOTE: Notification will
     be accomplished when conditions warrant. The 673 SFS Desk Sergeant has primary
     responsibility for notifying the 673 ABW/CP of adverse driving conditions.
     1.2. The 673 ABW/CP will notify the 673 MSG/CC who will notify the 673 ABW/CC and
     recommend one of the following:
        1.2.1. Mission Essential Reporting.
        1.2.2. Delayed Reporting.
        1.2.3. Early Release.
     1.3. The decision of Mission Essential Reporting or Delayed Reporting should be made no
     later than 0500 in the morning in order to inform the vast majority of the base population
     before they begin their drive to work.
     1.4. Once the decision is finalized, the 673 MSG/CC will instruct the 673 ABW/CP to
     implement the appropriate checklist for one of the options noted above. Personnel will be
     notified through their normal chain of command.
     1.5. The 673 MSG/CC will also contact 673 ABW/PA (through the 673 ABW/CP) who, in
     turn, will contact the local media and initiate changes to the Joint Base Elmendorf-
     Richardson Information Line (552-INFO/4636), Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson web page,
     Facebook (®, and Twitter ® sites with the latest reporting instructions.
2. General Instructions:
     2.1. Mission Essential Reporting. Unit commanders and supervisors must brief personnel,
     before adverse weather conditions occur, whether or not they are required to report as
     mission essential.
     2.2. Delayed Reporting. All personnel will report for duty by 1000.
     2.3. Early Release. Unit commanders are responsible for managing early release within
     their organizations; however, this action may only be initiated at the direction of the 673
     ABW/CC. The intent is a staggered departure to alleviate congestion leaving the base and to
     allow those who live farthest from base to leave first. Unless the circumstances are highly
     unusual, personnel residing on base should not be released early. If so, they should be the
     last released.
3. Tasks:
     3.1. The 673 SFS Desk Sergeant, 773 CES Snow Barn, 3 OSS Base Operations, and 3 OSS
     weather will notify the 673 ABW/CP anytime adverse weather conditions pose a significant
     impact to the installation including when:
        3.1.1. Snow greater than 10 inches has accumulated and poses a hazard to the installation
        or is anticipated within 4 hours.
673ABWI91-201 12 APRIL 2011                                                                  3


     3.1.2. Ice has formed on roadways and taxiways and poses a hazard to the installation or
     is anticipated within the next 4 hours.
     3.1.3. Volcanic or earthquake activity on or near the installation.
  3.2. The 673 ABW/CP will:
     3.2.1. Confirm adverse conditions with 673 SFS Desk Sergeant, 773 CES Snow Barn, 3
     OSS Base Operations and 3 OSS weather, and notify 673 MSG/CC when one of the
     aforementioned conditions are present.
     3.2.2. Implement notifications through instantaneous telephone alerting system (ITASS),
     AtHoc network mass notification system and advise base agencies and 24-hour unit
     control centers of adverse conditions, or implementation of early release , mission
     essential reporting, or delayed reporting, as directed.
     3.2.3. Push updated road condition information to the wireless road condition signs and
     across the AtHoc network mass notification system.
     3.2.4. Patch the 673 MSG/CC through to the Anchorage School District Superintendent,

     roadways.
     3.2.5. Notify the 176 WG/CC, 3 WG/CC, Air Force group commanders, and the US
     Army Alaska Command Center to request that they implement pyramid notification to
     advise assigned personnel of adverse weather conditions, implementation of early release,
     mission essential reporting, or delayed reporting.
     3.2.6. Notify the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) and the Army and Air Force
     Exchange Service of adverse weather conditions and implementation of early release or
     delay reporting of employees. The DeCA and Base Exchange Manager will each
     consider early release or delayed reporting of employees as necessary or directed. The
     Base Exchange Manager will consider closure of on-base gas stations, shoppettes, and the
     Base Exchange.
  3.3. The 673 FSS will:
     3.3.1. During duty hours, notify on-base child development centers (CDC) of adverse
     conditions.
     3.3.2. Ensure the CDCs are open 1 hour prior to the delayed reporting time. Therefore, if
     delayed reporting is declared until 1000, the CDCs will open at 0900.
     3.3.3. Ensure CDCs will not open when mission essential reporting is declared.
     3.3.4. Coordinate food and shelter for personnel remaining on the installation during
     inclement weather or emergency conditions.
  3.4. The 673 SFS will:
     3.4.1. Coordinate road closures with Anchorage Police and request updates on road
     conditions affecting the Glenn and Seward Highways.
     3.4.2. Continuously monitor road conditions and update 673 ABW/CP when roads

        mission essential reporting, as directed.
        3.6.2. Update the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson Information Line (552-INFO/4636),
        website, Facebook ®, and Twitter ® sites with the latest road conditions and reporting
        instructions (delayed reporting, mission essential reporting, or normal reporting).
     3.7. Unit Commanders will:
        3.7.1. Use pyramid notification to advise off-duty members of mission essential
        reporting or delayed reporting.
        3.7.2. Advise individuals released early to remain off roadways during snow/ice removal
        efforts.

        conditions (that is, emergency response, snow removal).
        3.7.5. Consider excusing individuals from duty when major roads between their home
        and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson are closed by the Alaska State Highway
        Department (that is, Glenn or Seward Highways).
        3.7.6. Consider the early release of civilian employees. Civilian absence due to adverse
        weather or emergency conditions will not be charged as leave. Individuals already on

        for adverse weather reporting information.
        3.8.2. Call their unit supervision if the base has not issued delayed reporting instructions
        but they believe driving conditions from their house are unsafe. Unit supervision can
        issue specific reporting instructions for individual employees based upon that employee’s
        situation.
        3.8.3. Implement their alternate child care plans during mission essential reporting
        declaration as the CDCs will not be opening.
4. Road Conditions:
     4.1. Approving Authority. Approving authority for road conditions is 673 MSG/CC. On-
     duty security forces and 773 CES Snow Barn may recommend changes in road conditions to
673ABWI91-201 12 APRIL 2011                                                                 5


   673 MSG/CC through the 673 ABW/CP. However, any individual may contact the Security
   Forces Desk to report adverse or unsafe road conditions. On-duty flight chiefs will then
   verify these conditions and forward request to the 673 ABW/CP. The road conditions are
   covered below with definitions and directed actions:
   4.2. GREEN. Roads are clear and dry. Comply with normal vehicle operating procedures
   and posted speed limits.
   4.3. AMBER. It has been determined that roads may be slippery due to snow, ice, or
   reduced visibility. Drivers will exercise caution.
   4.4. RED. It has been determined that roads may be hazardous due to snow, ice, or reduced
   visibility. Drivers will exercise caution and reduce speeds by 10 miles per hour below the
   posted speed limit.
   4.5. BLACK. It has been determined that road conditions are extremely hazardous due to
   ice, snow, or reduced visibility. Vehicle dispatching is prohibited unless directed by
   command authority. Only operate mission essential and emergency response vehicles.
   Drivers will exercise extreme caution and reduce speeds by 10 miles per hour, below the
   posted speed limit.
   4.6. Road Conditions. The 673 MSG/CC will determine road conditions and coordinate
   requests for early release, mission essential reporting and/or delayed reporting procedures
   with 673 ABW/CC. The decision on when motorcycles are allowed to be ridden on Joint
   Base Elmendorf-Richardson is made by the 673 MSG/CC, base upon a recommendation
   made by the 673 ABW Ground Safety Office. Motorcycle riding is not linked to specific
   road condition ratings. The 673 MSG, in cooperation with the 673 ABW Ground Safety
   Office and 673 ABW/ PA, will provide information to the base populace on motorcycle
   riding dates.
