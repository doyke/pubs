This instruction implements AFPD 90-1, Policy Formulation, and its provisions apply to all units located
on Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea. This instruction establishes procedures for scheduling events and
activities requiring support of distinguished visitors to Osan Air Base. It describes what routine inspec-
tions the protocol office conducts of supporting agencies.


1. Policies and Procedures.
   1.1. Notification and Coordination.
       1.1.1. To ensure effective use of base facilities and to avoid conflicts in scheduled events, any
       organization associate unit or assigned individual who wishes to request approval for an activity
       requiring protocol support will compete a 51 FW IMT 90, 51 FW Reception Support Request.
       1.1.2. Notify the Seventh Air Force Director of Staff (7AF/DS) of visits by staff assistance teams,
       inspectors, and evaluators, regardless of numerical composition of the group, but not transient air
       crews.
       1.1.3. Notify the 7 AF/51 FW Protocol Offices (7 AF/CCP and 51 FW/CCP) of any visits by an
       officer grade O-6 and above (DV Code 7, active duty or retired) or civilian grade GS-15 and above
       or any activities/visits involving the 7 AF/CC, 7 AF/CV, 51 FW/CC, or 51 FW/CV.
   1.2. Distinguished Visitors (DVs).
       1.2.1. DVs to Osan AB are of command interest and must receive every consideration to ensure
       visit requirements are managed in a courteous and professional manner. Every effort will be made
       to host DVs to Osan AB in a manner commensurate with their rank and status. This includes DVs
       visiting for formal inspections such as ORIs and UCIs. Osan will support them IAW 51 FWI
       90-202, Red Carpet Plan.
2                                                                   51FWI90-1011 1 SEPTEMBER 2005


       1.2.2. Any office with knowledge of a proposed visit of distinguished persons will notify
       7 AF/CCP and 51 FW/CCP immediately, 7 AF/CCP and 51 FW/CCP will, in turn, notify
       7 AF/CC, 7 AF/CV, 51 FW/CC, and 51 FW/CV.
       1.2.3. Foreign visitors of equal status to US Forces (unless otherwise advised by Headquarters
       USAF International Affairs (SAF/IA)) will be considered DVs.
    1.3. Greeter Duties for Military Arrivals.
       1.3.1. The unique missions and location of Osan AB results in large numbers of DVs traveling to
       or through Osan AB. All grade O-6 and above (active duty or retired) or civilian equivalent will be
       greeted upon arrival and departure by a colonel or colonel selectee or above, and extended courte-
       sies commensurate with their rank. The 51 FW/CC or his designated representative will greet gen-
       eral officers. This does not include DVs arriving via POV or GOV. DVs arriving via front gate will
       be met by the point of contact at pre-designated location (lodging, Bldg 882, etc), not necessarily
       by the designated greeting officer.
       1.3.2. Greeting officers will be available from 0700 to 2200 on the designated day for the purpose
       of greeting short/no-notice DVs. During non-duty hours, the greeting officer will plan his/her
       activities to ensure availability and minimize response time.
       1.3.3. If the greeting officer is unable to perform duties on the scheduled date and time due to per-
       sonal reasons, the greeting officer must obtain a substitute eligible colonel. If the greeting officer
       is unable to perform duties on the scheduled date and time due to official reasons (Leave or TDY),
       the greeting officer will inform the 51 FW Protocol office ASAP and Protocol will find a substi-
       tute colonel.
       1.3.4. Wearing of duty uniform: During non-duty hours, appropriate civilian dress may be worn.
       During duty-hours, a uniform must be worn.
       1.3.5. In some instances, arrival/departure officials will be designated specifically for certain vis-
       itors and will be reflected in the visitor’s itinerary prepared by the OPR and/or 51 FW/CCP.
       1.3.6. 51 FW/CCP will provide an estimated time of DV arrival as soon as one is obtained.
       51 FW/CCP will use all available means to track arrival of the DV.
       1.3.7. Should a DV arrive/depart unannounced, 51 OSS/OSAM (Base Ops) will immediately
       notify 51 FW/CCP who will in turn notify the greeting officer. In this case, 51 OSS/OSAM per-
       sonnel will greet the visitor and attend to his or her needs until the greeting officer verifies that all
       appropriate courtesies have been rendered.

       this rule must be coordinated with 51 FW/CCE, the wing executive officer. The briefing will
       include inclement weather plans.

4. Installation-Wide Functions
   4.1. Installation-wide functions should be scheduled at least six months in advance and the date must
   be cleared with 51 FW/CCE to be placed on the wing schedule. Specifically, the committee chair
   should submit an email recommending a date for the function. The email should include information
   such as the name and purpose of the event, availability of a facility to house the event, target audience,
   and contact information for the office of primary responsibility.
       4.1.1. If the committee has recommendations for a proposed guest speaker, provide the speaker’s
       name and a brief biography. If the proposed speaker information is not available at initial schedul-
       ing, then the committee chair should submit a staff summary package not later than four months
       prior to the event. The package will include the proposed agenda, proposed invitees (especially
       guests other than Osan AB attendees), the proposed guest speaker, and a letter of invitation to the
       guest speaker. This package should also include the committee’s intent for the speaker’s memento
       and address any funding issues. All of these details will be approved by the 51 FW/CC.
   4.2. Once the agenda and guest speaker have been approved, committee chairmen should work with
   51 FW/CCP and 51 FW/PA on the event details. 51 FW/CCP will be able to give insight into items
   and details the committee should be planning for the specific event. 51 FW/PA can assist with adver-
   tising the function and reviewing the prepared comments.
   4.3. Not later than three weeks prior to the event, the Protocol office and wing command section will
   review the printed program prior to submission to the print office. Additionally, the committee chair
   should submit proposed comments for the commander or vice commander to make during the event to
   allow time for review and rework, if required. Not later that one week out, provide Protocol with a
   copy of the script, sequence of events, and list of distinguished guest attendees so Protocol can assist
   with seating and inform the wing commander of the function’s details.

5. Facility Inspections.
   5.1. 51 FW/CCP will conduct inspection of DV support facilities once per quarter or after any signif-
   icant renovation work. These facilities include DV suites, base operations DV lounge, and base lodg-
   ing business suites.
   5.2. Inspection of DV Suites will be conducted by one member of 51 FW/CCP, 51 CES/CEO, and 51
   SVS/SVML.
       5.2.1. 51 FW/CCP will use the 51 FW IMT 93, DV Suite Inspection Checklist, to inspect DV
       Suites for cleanliness, a complete set of amenities, and identify needed repairs. Completed check-
       lists will be kept on file in the 51 FW/CCP office for one (1) year from the date of inspection.
       5.2.2. 51 CES/CEO will make note of any identified repairs, initiate work orders, and update

       5.3.1. 51 FW/CCP will use the 51 FW IMT 94, DV Lounge Inspection Checklist, to inspect DV
       Lounge for cleanliness, a complete set of amenities, and identify needed repairs. Completed
       checklists will be kept on file in the 51 FW/CCP office for one (1) year from the date of inspec-
       tion.
       5.3.2. The Base Operations Facility Manager will make note of any identified repairs, initiate
       work orders, and update 51 FW/CCP weekly of their status. The Facility Manager will also brief
       the status of these repairs at CES quarterly update meetings.
    5.4. Inspection of base lodging business suites will be conducted by one member of 51 FW/CCP and/
    or
    7 AF/CCP and 51 SVS/SVML.
       5.4.1. 51 FW/CCP will use the 51 FW IMT 93 to inspect base lodging business suites for cleanli-
       ness, a complete set of amenities, and identify needed repairs. Completed checklists will be kept

6. DV Aircraft Parking Operations.
    6.1. Refer to Flightline Diagram (Attachment 1) and Fixed Wing Aircraft Types and Rotary Wing
    Aircraft Types (Attachment 2). There are three Red Carpets for DV arrivals:
       6.1.1. East Base Ops Apron. Primary DV reception spot. This parking spot can be used for all
       helicopter aircraft and fixed wing aircraft no larger than 94 feet wide and 97 feet long. This spot
       has been used for Boeing 757 operations, though it requires extreme caution because of wing tip
       clearances. Aircraft with a wing span no larger than the UH-60 can park two abreast on this spot.
       6.1.2. West Base Ops Apron. Secondary DV reception spot. This parking spot can be used for all
       aircraft, although aircraft larger than a KC-10 or aircraft parked two-abreast restrict the size of air-
       craft that can use Taxiway Foxtrot.
       6.1.3. AMC Apron. Primary DV reception spot for CDR, UNC/CFC/USFK transit operations.
    6.2. The current configuration on Base Ops Ramp was designed around a VC-37 on East Base Ops
    with two H-60s parked abreast north/south of each other on West Base Ops. The taxi lines allow the
    VC-37 to taxi out of the parking ramp while the UH-60s remain in the chocks. The taxi lines do not
    allow UH-60s to taxi out while the VC-37 remains parked on East Base Ops. To ensure wing tip clear-
    ance in this second case, the northern most UH-60 would have to leave the parking ramp first.
    6.3. In addition to the lines explained in paragraph 6.2. there are taxi lines for two small aircraft
    (details below), line abreast, on both West and East Base Ops. Additionally, there is a taxi line for
    MD-11/DC-10/L-1011 aircraft on West Base Ops.
51FWI90-1011 1 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                              7


7. CDR, UNC/CFC/USFK Operations: Osan AB frequently hosts the 4-star commander of United
Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and United States Forces Korea. If the general is only
using small aircraft, East Base Ops is the primary parking location. If the general is flying on the KC-10,
the following will be used:
   7.1. The KC-10 “Silver Bullet” is the primary aircraft for long distance flights. The KC-10 parks on
   the AMC Apron (spot 5), normally facing west.
   7.2. AMC must de-conflict KC-10 ops with the dual UH-60 ops. The dual UH-60s park at two spots
   south of the KC-10 facing east.
   7.3. Dual UH-60s Operations
       7.3.1. Primary pickup/drop-off point is AMC Apron.
       7.3.2. There are three parking locations for use when dual UH-60s are on station for an extended
       period awaiting a DV operation.
           7.3.2.1. Primary relocation spot is West Base Ops.
           7.3.2.2. Secondary relocation spot is Delta Hardstand.
           7.3.2.3. Tertiary relocation spot is Doorstop.

8. Multiple DV Operations.
   8.1. Osan AB periodically hosts multiple DV operations simultaneously, requiring extra coordination
   between Airfield Management, Air Traffic Control, Transient Alert and Protocol. The largest opera-
   tions involve helicopter packages of 6 to 12 aircraft. With precise coordination, it is possible to rotate
   aircraft through the Base Ops Ramp in an efficient manner.
   8.2. UH-60, Multiple Operations (More than 6), Arrivals:
       8.2.1. Up to 6 UH-60s can drop off passengers in succession on the Base Ops Ramp, provided the
       AMC Patriot Express is not parked on West Base Ops. This requires ATC and pilots to sequence
       the aircraft prior to entering the ramp, as there is no room to maneuver once aircraft have arrived.
       8.2.2. Additional aircraft may enter the Base Ops Ramp after the aircraft in front of them rotate
       out.
   8.3. UH-60, Multiple Operations (More than 6), Departures:
       8.3.1. Aircraft will be staged by Transient Alert prior to DV departures according to priorities set
       by Protocol and the parking plan set by Airfield Management and Transient Alert.
       8.3.2. When departing (assuming there are 6 UH-60s on Base Ops Ramp), the eastern most air-
       craft must depart before the other aircraft have wing tip clearance to depart.
       8.3.3. Additional aircraft, normally parked on Doorstop and/or Delta Hardstand, will relocate to
       the Base Ops Ramp as soon as the aircraft in front of them rotate out.

9. Single/Small Scale DV Operations: The most frequent DV operation involves only one to three air-
craft at a time. The vast majority of these small scale DV ops can occur at East Base Ops Ramp.

10. ATC Procedures.
8                                                                51FWI90-1011 1 SEPTEMBER 2005


    10.1. ATC will provide priority handling according to established guidelines.
    10.2. CDR, UNC/CFC/USFK support helicopters will generally land at Taxiway Delta for expedi-
    tious taxi to the AMC Ramp.

11. IG Team Red Carpet Reception: Conducted in accordance with the 51 FWI 90-202.

12. Cautionary Safety Issues.
    12.1. C-5 Operations: Wing-tip clearance for C-5 is reduced to 15 feet when a UH-60 or C-12 is
    parked outboard on the Base Ops Ramp. This requires wing walkers or runway back taxi operations.
    12.2. Base Ops Ramp:
       12.2.1. Base Ops Apron parking scenarios can be complex. The most important issue is wing-tip

13. Command and Control.
    13.1. Execution of complex and/or high priority DV operations must be coordinated with the 51 FW
    Supervisor of Flying (SOF). The SOF will coordinate with Osan-based flying units to maintain safe,
    efficient flying operations. While ROK military personnel can act as liaisons and translators in the
    Control Tower, they are not to be considered supervisors and have no authority to make decisions
    regarding the conduct of operations. ROK military liaisons and translators can enter the Control
    Tower only with consent of the SOF and Tower Watch Supervisor. No more than three ROK military
    members should be in the Control Tower at one time.
