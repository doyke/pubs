                                            Chapter 1

                TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (HM)

1.1. Purpose and Overview. This instruction is based on USAFEI 23-104, Command
Dangerous Goods Program (CDGP) Para 3.2, implementing the Ramstein AB Installation
Dangerous Goods Program (IDGP). It applies to all units/sections having a requirement to
move HM/HW/CW to off base destinations, on the installation or in areas other than the
restricted areas of munitions storage, aerial ports or flight lines. Defense Transportation
Regulation (DTR) DOD 4500.9R, Chap 204, Para C 2 directs services to comply with applicable
Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) and host nation (HN) requirements when moving
hazardous material off-the-installation by commercial surface or air transportation mode. IAW
CDGP, Para 3.2 the Installation Commander determines the requirements for on-installation
transportation of regulated amounts of hazardous material, as defined in this instruction. On-
installation transportation of HM/HW/CW applies to roads controlled by the installation and
access to the road is restricted at all times through the use of gates and/or guards. With the
exemption of the Chapter 10, unless stated otherwise, all chapters and attachments of this
instruction apply to off-base transportation of HM. This publication may not be supplemented or
altered. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. Specific to Germany, the supplementary agreement (SA) to the SOFA, article 57,
section 3 regulates a force and a civilian component must observe the regulations on the
transport of hazardous material. The USAFE CDGP is the coordinated standard with the
German MOD on how USAFE units stationed in Germany implement these regulations.
1.2. Responsibilities and duties. Responsibilities and duties of Commanders, Dangerous
Goods Advisors (DGAs) and functional elements (e.g. Shippers, Carriers, Certifiers) of units
transporting HM are prescribed in the USAFE Command Dangerous Goods Program (CDGP),
USAFEI 23-104. Squadrons assigned to 86AW, including GSUs, and tenant units stationed on
Ramstein AB with responsibilities and duties according to CDGP are listed in attachment 22.
This list will be reviewed and updated by the IDGA annually, based on information gained
during mandatory inspections. In general, all personnel involved in activities relating to the
movement of HM/HW/CW must ensure all safety requirements are met. Commanders of tenant
units may implement their own instruction to organize the duties and responsibilities identified in
the CDGP and as directed and coordinated within their own command structure. Note: The
premises identified in section 1.1. of this OI in relation to the SA, article 57, cannot be modified
w/o coordination through the USAFE CDGPM.
   1.2.1. Installation Commander. The overall responsibility for the transportation of
   HM/HW/CW rests with 86th AW/CC.
   1.2.2. Unit Commanders. Unit Commanders appointed to manage the program on behalf of
   the Installation Commander will ensure assigned personnel comply with obligations and
   provisions prescribed in the USAFE Command DG Program (CDGP), USAFEI 23-104, and
   this instruction.
   1.2.3. Dangerous Goods Advisors (DGAs).
 6                                                 RAMSTEINABI23-104 5 AUGUST 2013


       1.2.3.1. The Installation DGA (IDGA) manages the implementation and execution of the
       USAFE CDGP on Ramstein AB IAW section 4 of USAFE 23-104. In this capacity the
       IDGA consults to the Installation Commander and subordinate units and is responsible
       implementing the local policy regarding preparing, moving, receiving, training, and
       monitoring the DG program. The IDGA office is assigned to 86 LRG; Location bldg
       2126, DSN 480-5530. Primary and alternate IDGA provide on call duty to support on-
       scene commanders in case of an incident according to KMC Hazardous Materials
       Emergency Response Plan and to assist Units in case of a HM/HW/CW related
       movement accident or incident. Contact Fire Department Dispatch Office at DSN 480-
       7683 if IDGA assistance is required after regular duty hours or on weekends.
       1.2.3.2. Unit DGAs (UDGA), appointed at Flight, Squadron or Group level, are
       executing the USAFE Command Dangerous Goods Program on behalf of the Unit
       Commander. Unit Commanders still remain ultimately responsible. Attachment 23
       provides a self-inspection checklist to be used by UDGAs to ensure general compliance
       with the CDGP. CDGP related documents shall be filed in single binder(s) as structured
       and described in Attachment 24. Note: Names and contact information of the IDGA
       and UDGA must be posted on the safety board of every unit handling hazardous material.
1.3. Scope. Surface movements of Hazardous Materials, on or off Ramstein Air Base, must
comply with the safety provisions set forth in this instruction and to the provisions of the
European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road
(ADR), and EC 1272/2008, Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP). This instruction does
not apply to on-base transportation of explosives or ammunition. For the movement of
ammunition and explosives refer to AFMAN 91-201 and corresponding USAFE Sup1. In areas
where the Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR), Part II (DOD 4500.9-R) is more stringent
than ADR, DTR Part II applies for movements of Hazardous Materials on the installation. Note:
Organizations moving dangerous goods or hazardous waste on Ramstein Air Base must keep a
current copy of the ADR on file in the unit. The most current version of the ADR (PDF file) may
be downloaded from the following web-site: http://www.unece.org/trans/welcome.html

     down equipment or chains) or equivalent load securing methods (barriers) will be used to
     transport packages containing HM/HW/CW.
     2.1.9.2. POVs are not authorized for the carriage of HM/HW/CW unless explicitly
     authorized by the DOD Component HQ due to operational necessity. If a POV is used
     for official duty travel transporting HM/HW/CW the exemptions listed in the ADR for
     private persons will not apply.
     2.1.9.3. Under no circumstances will packages containing HM/HW/CW requiring
     ventilation be carried in vehicle passenger compartment. If HM/HW/CW is moved in
     open passenger compartments, i.e. vans or busses, provided ventilation is not required,
     the packages must be secured IAW the safety principles for load securing.
     2.1.9.4. Closed or sheeted vehicles must be used for the carriage of packages sensitive to
     moisture.
     2.1.9.5. Open or ventilated vehicles/containers (ventilated: one 10x10 cm opening at the
     top front and one 10x10 cm opening at the rear end of the trailer) may be required to
     carry HM/HW/CW, if directed by the ‘Special Provisions for Carriage’ outlined in Chap
     3.2, Table A, Column ADR (e.g. CV 36 or V14).
  2.1.10. Step 10 – Load Securing (*4, 6). Packages containing HM/HW/CW must be
  securely fixed or packed in vehicles or containers to prevent movement or release of
  dangerous goods during transportation. AE 55-48, Blocking and Bracing for Motor
  Transport, Technical Orders (e.g. T.O. 11A-1-61-series), VDI 2700 series, MIL-STD 1386
  series, or European or American Motor Carrier best load securing practices may be used to
  determine load securing (blocking and bracing techniques). Personnel applying load
  securing principles must be in the possession of the applicable training certificate.
  2.1.11. Step 11 – Placarding (Hazmat placards and orange-colored plates) (*4, 6,
  7). Tank-vehicles (including tank-vehicles, not drained and purged) and other transport units
  or large containers (ISOs and MILVANs) carrying HM exceeding threshold limits specified
  in table 1.1.3.6.3, ADR must be placarded, marked and furnished with orange-colored plates
  according to Ch. 5.3, ADR. Corresponding placards required for other modes of transport
  (including placards specified in CFR 49), with minor variations which do not affect the
  obvious meaning of the placards, are also acceptable. The placards may include text such as
  UN number or words describing the hazard (i.e. ‘Flammable Liquid’) provided the text does
  not obscure or detract from other required placard elements. Affixing an additional placard
  at the front of the tractor is optional. Cover or remove placards and orange-colored plates
  once vehicle is unloaded, clean and free of residues. Note: Tank vehicles or tank containers
  must be empty, drained and purged prior to removing placards and/or orange colored plates.
