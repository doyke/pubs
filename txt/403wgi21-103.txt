This instruction implements AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and
AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. It establishes guidance in the event of an aircraft
or equipment malfunction which would warrant an impoundment and/or investigation. It
identifies impounding officials and clarifies local procedures. This applies to all personnel
directly involved in aircraft support here at Keesler AFB. Refer any recommended changes to
this publication to the (OPR) using the Air Force Information Management Tool (AF IMT) 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publications: route AF IMTs 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional’ s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Correct attachment reference to reflect updates.
1. DEFINITIONS:
   1.1. Impoundment is the safekeeping of an aircraft or equipment after an unusual
   occurrence.
   1.2. Impoundment Authority (IA) is the designated individual who is authorized to impound
   an aircraft or piece of equipment.
2                                                                403WGI21-103 14 JUNE 2012


    1.3. Impoundment Official (IO) is the designated individual who is responsible for
    controlling, monitoring, and investigating the impounded aircraft or equipment. This
    individual is the single point of contact.
    1.4. Impoundment Release Authority (IRA) is an individual authorized to release aircraft or
    equipment from impoundment.
    1.5. MXG/CC will appoint IA. In addition, Wing Safety and Operations Group Commanders
    are authorized Impoundment Authorities. MXG/CC may appoint by letter, updated and
    reviewed annually, a full time senior ART as IRA and may temporarily delegate IRA
    authority to the deployed MOO/MX SUPT for deployments.
2. REASONS FOR IMPOUNDMENT OF AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT:
    2.1. When the Impoundment Authority determines extraordinary measures are required to
    ensure safe operation of aircraft and equipment.
    2.2. Whenever a mishap occurs as defined in AFI 91-204, Chapter 1.
    2.3. Any item listed in AFI 21-101, Chapter 9.
    2.4. Impoundment authorities will determine if impoundment is warranted when:
       2.4.1. Air Drop Malfunction has occurred.
       2.4.2. When the aircraft or engine has suspected foreign object damage (FOD).
       2.4.3. Unusual operating performance or system malfunction is experienced.
       2.4.4. Any discrepancies or malfunctions considered to be unusual or requiring further
       investigation.
3. IMPOUNDMENT PROCEDURES:
    3.1. The IA will appoint an IO. IOs are identified by having course code INSP 000157
    active on their GO81 training run.
    3.2. Quality Assurance (QA) will accomplish the Impoundment Checklist (Attachment 2)
    and provide a copy of the checklist and an IO workbook to the IO.
    3.3. The IO will initiate Aircraft/Equipment Impoundment Official Work Sheet
    (Attachment 3) for any aircraft or equipment impoundment.
    3.4. When an aircraft/equipment is impounded, the IO will utilize the pre-printed
    impoundment AFTO Form 781A/244/245, or will enter in the next open block of the AFTO
    Form 781A/244/245 the four discrepancies identified in item 9 of the Aircraft/Equipment IO
    Work Sheet (Attachment 3).
    3.5. The IO will release the aircraft/equipment for maintenance required to safe, troubleshoot
    and repair the effected system or piece of equipment. The IO may release the aircraft for
    servicing operations if it will not impact the impoundment investigation or subsequent repair
    efforts.
    3.6. The IO will direct any/all maintenance to be performed on the aircraft/equipment.
    3.7. An entry control point will be established for controlling access to the aircraft for any
    impoundment where sabotage is suspected, if loss of life has occurred or if directed by the
403WGI21-103 14 JUNE 2012                                                                          3


   IA. An entry control log will be used (Attachment 4/5) on every impoundment to document
   all personnel accessing or performing maintenance on the impounded aircraft/equipment.
   3.8. An impoundment sign will be placed at the nose of the aircraft. When impoundment
   release maintenance is not being performed the impoundment sign will be secured inside the
   aircraft and the aircraft will be locked and sealed. The seal number will be documented in
   the aircraft 781A.
   3.9. Once the investigation is complete and aircraft/equipment has been returned to a safe
   condition, all findings will be presented to the Release Authority for review.
   3.10. The Release Authority will clear the 781A/AFTO Form 244, and any proposed release
   IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 9, and AFI 91-204, paragraph 5.7.
   3.11. Notify 22AF/A4M and HQ AFRC/A4M of all findings.
4. PROCEDURES FOR OFF STATION IMPOUNDMENT:
   4.1. For aircraft away from home station perform the following:
   4.2. Secure aircraft and notify home station MOC at the earliest available time with a
   complete description of the problem.
   4.3. No maintenance will be performed until directed by the MXG/CC or designated
   representative.
   4.4. Off station impoundment package will be sent to location of aircraft.
5. OTHER THAN NORMAL DUTY HOURS: If night shift supervisor or designated
representative feels there is justification for an aircraft to be impounded, the requirements in this
instruction and AFI 21-101 will be met to the maximum extent possible. Secure aircraft with a
boxcar seal and annotate seal number in aircraft forms. Aircraft will only be opened by a
representative from QA or the assigned IO. Notify MOC of intent and ensure a complete
description of malfunction to include names of individuals involved is included in the night shift
turnover.
