Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction was revised substantially and should be read in its entirety. Changes
include: Expansion of the scope of the instruction to include association with foreign nationals;
eliminating the requirement for automatic suspension of access to classified and replacing it with
debriefing for an indefinite period; and reducing the lead time for notification to 90 days.
1. Purpose. This instruction provides policy guidance for commanders as well as command-
wide procedures and timelines for those SCI-indoctrinated persons who wish to marry or cohabit
with or associate with a foreign national or with someone possessing dual-citizenship. This
instruction also describes the actual and potential consequences to a military member’s security
clearance and/or career should marriage, cohabitation or association take place after a non-
concurrence on the formal notification of the member’s intent to marry, to cohabit or to
associate, or in cases where an SCI-indoctrinated person fails to notify the supporting Special
Security Office in advance of the event.
2. Background.
    2.1. Nothing in this instruction is intended to prevent marriage to, cohabitation with, or
    association with foreign nationals.
    2.2. Nothing in this instruction supersedes or contradicts requirements found in Air Force
    Instruction (AFI) 36-2609, Marriage in Overseas Commands.
    2.3. The purpose of this instruction is to protect the National Security interests of the United
    States.
    2.4. Relationships and associations between SCI-indoctrinated persons and foreign nationals
    heightens concerns regarding their effect on the national security of the United States.
    2.5. American citizens who plan to marry a foreign national while present in that person’s
    country need to be aware that by doing so they may inadvertently acquire citizenship in that
    country or acquire dual citizenship status. This could raise issues of continuing eligibility for
    access to classified information. They should check with the local Judge Advocate and the
    American Embassy or Consulate before marrying in a foreign country. (See the United
    States State Department’s web site for the most current information.)
3. Applicability. This instruction applies to all AFSOC active duty military personnel, civilian
employees, contractors, consultants and AFSOC-gained Air National Guard (ANG) and Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) personnel, to Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs)
assigned to AFSOC, and to all other activities assigned to Air Force Special Operations
Command. For purposes of this instruction, when the term ―AFSOC‖ is used, it includes all of
the above.
4. Terms.
    4.1. Association: For purposes of this instruction, ―association‖ is defined as close, frequent
    contact with a foreign national or person with dual citizenship not resulting from official
    United States Government business. It includes relationships such as employer-employee
AFSOCI14-301 21 AUGUST 2009                                                                     3


   (e.g., nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, etc. employed by SCI-indoctrinated persons as well
   as an SCI-indoctrinated person employed by a foreign national), foreign-born roommates (of
   either gender) outside of cohabitation (see below), as well as off-duty contact with foreign
   national friends/neighbors. ―Live-in‖ arrangements with foreign nationals are a special
   concern. The term ―association‖ does not include incidental contact with foreign nationals.
   4.2. Cohabitant: The person with whom an individual shares a residence in any capacity or
   who lives in an intimate, spouse-like relationship outside of marriage. See ―cohabitation‖
   below.
   4.3. Cohabitation: Sharing a residence or living in an intimate, spouse-like relationship
   outside of marriage. This includes any activity commonly defined as ―living together‖ or
   ―moving in together.‖
   4.4. Dual Citizenship:     American citizenship and citizenship in another country
   simultaneously. Sometimes this is referred to as dual nationality. For example, a person
   might have American and German citizenship simultaneously. For purposes of this
   instruction, persons with dual citizenship are processed in the same manner as any other
   foreign national.
   4.5. Foreign National: A citizen of any country other than the United States of America to
   include any alien (legal or illegal) within the United States of America, its territories or
   possessions.
   4.6. Incidental contact: Unplanned contact resulting from residence or travel in a foreign
   country or with foreign nationals within the United States.
   4.7. Special Security Office (SSO): The office tasked by the Headquarters AFSOC Senior
   Intelligence Officer (HQ AFSOC/A2) with responsibility for the receipt, control,
   accountability and management of all aspects of the security of all SCI and for overseeing
   the SCI security functions for subordinate SCIFs. There are only two SSOs in AFSOC: SSO
   CANNON and SSO AFSOC. SSO CANNON is responsible for the SCI program for all
   units assigned to, attached to, or tenant at Cannon Air Force Base. SSO AFSOC is
   responsible for all other AFSOC units/locations and is the MAJCOM SSO.
5. Policy.
   5.1. SCI-indoctrinated AFSOC personnel will notify the supporting Special Security Office
   in advance of their planned marriage to, cohabitation with, or association with a foreign
   national.
   5.2. The AFSOC Senior Intelligence Officer, the person responsible for the security of SCI
   within AFSOC, then will review all intended/actual marriages, cohabitations, and
   associations involving SCI-indoctrinated personnel and foreign nationals, and evaluate the
   effect of these relationships on the national security. Because of these security concerns, any
   marriage to, cohabitation with, or association with foreign nationals also will result in a
   formal reevaluation by the Air Force Central Adjudication Authority (AFCAF) of the
   indoctrinated individual’s continued eligibility for access to SCI. (ICPG 704.2, DOD
   5105.21-M-1, paragraph 2.L., and AFMAN 14-304, paragraph 2.7.)

6. Procedures.
    6.1. Individuals contemplating marriage to, cohabitation with or association with (i.e.,
    establishing a relationship with) a foreign national:
       6.1.1. Will submit a letter of notification to HQ AFSOC/A2 through their chain of
       command and supporting SSO at least 90 days in advance of the marriage, cohabitation
       or association. This letter will follow the format provided as Attachment 2 to this
       instruction and include all endorsements listed in the format.
       6.1.2. Will submit a request for a Special Agreement Check (OFI Form 86C) on the
       foreign national through the local Information Protection office or Security Forces
       squadron.
    6.2. Endorsers. Each person signing an endorsement to this notification:
       6.2.1. Will carefully consider the potential effects of the marriage to, cohabitation with
       or association with a foreign national on the national security of the United States before
       concurring or non-concurring on the notification.
       6.2.2. Will forward the notification to the next endorser regardless of whether they
       concur or non-concur.
       6.2.3. Will list the reason(s) why they non-concur on a notification, if applicable.
    6.3. Headquarters (HQ) AFSOC and 23 AF Staff Directors, and all Unit Commanders:
       6.3.1. Before endorsing any request, HQ AFSOC and 23 AF staff directors, and unit
       commanders will counsel persons desiring to marry, to cohabit with, or to associate with
       foreign nationals regarding the possibility that continuing eligibility for their security
       clearance and SCI access may be adversely affected by these actions and that
       concurrence by HQ AFSOC/A2 does not guarantee a favorable eligibility decision by the
       AFCAF.
       6.3.2. This counseling must be in writing and acknowledged by the individual intending
       to establish a relationship with the foreign national. The original will be forwarded to
       HQ AFSOC/A2S via the supporting SSO with copies provided to the individual and the
       commander/director counseling the individual. (The format for the counseling letter is
       provided as Attachment 3).
    6.4. Information Protection Offices/Security Forces Squadrons. The local Personnel
    Security activity will submit the Special Agreement Check on the foreign national
    fiancé/fiancée, cohabitant or associate.
    6.5. Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) Update. The supporting SSO will update
    the JPAS file on the individual concerned and forward such information to the AFCAF as
    appropriate.
    6.6. Special Security Representatives (SSR) and/or SCI Managers (SCIM) will assist the
    requestor as needed.
7. Final Review.
    7.1. Only the HQ AFSOC/A2 or the HQ AFSOC Deputy A2 will make the final review of a
    notification of intent to marry, to cohabit, or to associate with a foreign national. The
AFSOCI14-301 21 AUGUST 2009                                                                    5


   standard for concurrence is that the benefit afforded to the United States’ national security
   interests by allowing continued SCI access must clearly outweigh any associated security
   risk.
   7.2. Factors bearing on the HQ AFSOC/A2 review:
      7.2.1. Include the personal background, employment, and ties to a foreign government of
      the fiancé/fiancée, cohabitant or associate as well as of all members of that person’s
      immediate family.
      7.2.2. Any connection to a foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activity will result
      in a ‖non-concur‖ from the HQ AFSOC/A2 due to security concerns.
8. Security Concerns.
   8.1. If any endorser of the notification believes the marriage, cohabitation, or association
   would create an actual or potential conflict of interest with respect to the security of the
   United States or, creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or
   coercion, or that the foreign national may act to increase the member’s vulnerability to
   possible future exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, he/she will
   ―non-concur‖ on the notification. Their rationale will be included in the response sent to the
   requestor’s commander/staff director.
   8.2. If the HQ AFSOC/A2 non-concurs with the individual’s notification of marriage to,
   cohabitation with, or association with a foreign national:
      8.2.1. The supporting SSO will:
          8.2.1.1. Immediately debrief the individual from access to SCI. JPAS will be
          updated to reflect ―O – See Remarks‖ as the reason for the debriefing and ―Member
          debriefed. An incident was opened due to Foreign Influence.‖
          8.2.1.2. Initiate an incident report (WITHOUT SUSPENSION) in JPAS under the
          Foreign Influence category.
          8.2.1.3. Inform the requestor’s commander of the Security Information File (SIF)
          establishment and SCI debriefing by the most expeditious means available and
          request them to take action to complete the SIF action in accordance with Chapter 8,
          AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.
          8.2.1.4. Forward all available information from the SIF to the AFCAF for
          readjudication.
          8.2.1.5. Inform the member’s commander of the SIF establishment in accordance
          with Chapter 8, AFI 31-501.
   8.3. The member’s commander/staff director will:
      8.3.1. Inform the member in writing of the SIF establishment          in accordance with
      Chapter 8, AFI 31-501.
      8.3.2. Take action to complete the SIF in accordance with Chapter 8, AFI 31-501 and
      forward documentation to HQ AFSOC/A2S (SSO AFSOC) which will be the Servicing
      Security Activity described in AFI 31-501.
6                                                              AFSOCI14-301 21 AUGUST 2009


        8.3.3. Direct the unit security manager and/or special security representative to take
        action to remove the individual from local access lists to include Restricted and
        Controlled Areas and to notify all activities which require access to SCI as a precondition
        for access to their respective programs. (For example: Those responsible for Alternative
        Compensatory Control Measures (ACCM) programs, Special Access Programs, etc.)
9. Failure To Provide the Required Notification Before Marriage/Cohabitation.
    9.1. If an SCI-indoctrinated individual marries, cohabits with or associates with a foreign
    national without notifying their chain of command and their supporting SSO as required by
    this instruction and does so knowingly, the unit commander/staff director must immediately:
        9.1.1. Request establishment of a SIF.
        9.1.2. Request the supporting SSO/SSR debrief the person from access to all classified
        information. The individual will remain debriefed until the AFCAF provides new
        eligibility for access to classified information.
    9.2. If an SCI-indoctrinated individual provides less than the required 90 days advance
    notice of their intent to marry, to cohabit with, or to associate with a foreign national, the Air
    Force is not obligated to provide expedited processing of the notification and the individual
    proceeds at his/her own risk.
10. Miscellaneous.
    10.1. Willful disregard of the requirements in this instruction may subject the individual to
    disciplinary or punitive action.
    10.2. Willful disregard of the requirement to provide advance notice will weigh heavily in
    the evaluation of the SIF by the AFCAF. If the AFCAF decides to revoke the individual’s
    eligibility for access to classified information (i.e., their security clearance), the individual
    may be subject to involuntary retraining and their continued retention by the Air Force may
    be at risk.

MEMORANDUM FOR: [RANK, NAME & SSAN OF INDIVIDUAL]

FROM: [Unit Commander / Staff Director]

SUBJECT: Counseling Regarding the Potential Effects on Eligibility for Access to Classified
          Information Resulting From Marriage to / Cohabitation With, or Association With A
          Foreign National

1. You have informed me of your intention to marry, cohabit or associate with a foreign national. This
memorandum serves as an official record that you have been counseled on the potential consequences
which may result from this action.

2. Your eligibility for continued access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and other
classified information will be reevaluated by the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF).
Three options are available to the AFCAF:

   a. Recertify your eligibility for access to SCI.

   b. Downgrade your eligibility and grant access to classified information to a lower level.

   c. Determine you are ineligible for access to classified information at any level.

3. Your record in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System will be updated to reflect your marriage to,
cohabitation with, or association with a foreign national. This update may adversely affect your future
access to various U.S. government facilities to include military installations because the file will indicate
your eligibility for access to classified information is being reevaluated. Policies concerning access to
certain Department of Defense and other U.S. government facilities are made by the various activities
charged with the security of those facilities.

4. HQ AFSOC/A2 is the final reviewer of your notification to marry, cohabit with, associate with a
foreign national. The decision of the HQ AFSOC/A2 is separate and distinct from any decision by the
AFCAF. Factors bearing on the HQ AFSOC/A2’s decision to concur or non-concur include (but are not
limited to):

   a. The personal background, employment, and ties to a foreign government of the foreign national as
   well as of all members of their immediate family.

   b. A connection to a foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activity. (This will likely result in a
   non-concurrence on the request.)
16                                                                  AFSOCI14-301 21 AUGUST 2009


5. If the HQ AFSOC/A2 non-concurs (i.e., the HQ AFSOC/A2 determines that your planned relationship
with a foreign national would adversely affect the national security), any or all of the following may
happen depending upon the circumstances of the requestor’s situation:

     a. Establishment of a Security Information File (SIF), debriefing from SCI access and/or all access to
     classified information.

     b. I will be notified of the SIF and the debriefing from SCI access and/or all classified information.

     c. Filing of an incident report in JPAS.

6. If you proceed with the marriage, cohabitation, or association after HQ AFSOC/A2 non-concurs:

     a. A Security Information File (SIF) will be established and you will be debriefed from all access to
     classified information.

     b. An incident report will be filed in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System.

7. If your eligibility for access to classified information is downgraded by the AFCAF, you may become
ineligible to retain your current Air Force Specialty Code and/or become ineligible for deployment. If
your eligibility for access to classified is revoked, you could be involuntarily separated from the Air
Force.

8. You will receive a copy of this signed memorandum.
