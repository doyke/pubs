This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 3, Boeing. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 3 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by the Boeing Company. Boeing was first formed in 1916 as Pacific               Aero
Products Co, changing its name about a year later to the Boeing Airplane Co. Through several
mergers over the years (the last being with McDonnell Douglas Corp in 1997), the Boeing
Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing, Donald
Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of the date
of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet aircraft
alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 3, Boeing Addenda. Volume 3 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 3 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Boeing
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 3, Boeing Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum D. Boeing B757 Series.
The B757 Series aircraft are narrow-body, twin engine aircraft, designed for short to medium
range routes. The B757 incorporated increases in technology, as well as use of newer, lighter
materials, over its predecessors, the B727 and B737 Originals. The versatile B757 can also
accommodate long range routes, with optional Extended Range Operations (EROPS)
modifications. The B757 is said by Boeing to have "unsurpassed" fuel efficiency, as well as low
noise levels. Both the B757 and the B767 series aircraft were developed concurrently, and share
many common features. In 1983, the FAA announced that a pilot who qualifies in one model is
automatically qualified on the other. Therefore, many companies that operate the B757 will also
operate the B767, further increasing efficiency and savings. When Boeing ceased production of
the B757 in 2004, 1,050 aircraft had been manufactured, and over 990 are still in service to date.

The B757-200 was the first aircraft in this series and was developed in 1979. It first flew in
February of 1982, and was type-certified in December 1982. The B757-200's new high-bypass
turbofan engines and lighter materials (saving over 2,000 lbs in operating weight) increased its
range/passenger capability. The military variant of this model is designated the C-32, mainly
used by the Air Force for VIP transport. In total, 913 B757-200’s were manufactured, and the
last B757aircraft delivered on April 2005 was actually the B757-200.

The B757-200PF/SF ("PF" for Package Freighter, "SF" for Special Freighter) came next,
initially flying in August 1987, and getting its type certification on September that year.
Essentially, a B757-200PF is a B757-200 with the addition of a main deck cargo door and
removal of passenger windows and amenities. Originally, 80 B757-200PF aircraft were
manufactured, but that number is now increasing, due to many B757-200 passenger planes being
converted into B757SF's.

The B757-300 was manufactured as a "stretch" version of the baseline B757-200. Boeing
developed it to be roughly 23 feet longer than the B757-200 series, and it can carry 20% more
passengers and 50% more cargo volume in its lower compartments than the original. Although
the wings and landing gear were strengthened to handle the increased load, modifications to
increase fuel capacity were prohibitive. This put the B757-300's range as slightly less, but
overall, resulted in a 10 percent lower seat-mile operating cost than the 757-200 The B757-300
first flew in August 1998 and was type-certified on January 1999. Only 55 of this series' model
were built, and approximately 50 are currently in service.

AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 3, Addendum D will focus primarily on the:

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 3 Addendum.

Notes:
                                              1) Shows inside dimensions where cargo compartment has a constant cross-section (internal contour measured perpendicular to the
                                                 aircraft length - excludes any tapered section of the fuselage).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              MAIN COMPARTMENT CONTOUR CHART B757-200PF




                                              2) Minimum 2 inches of clearance must exist between aircraft contour and maximum payload contour (represented by inner solid line of
                                                 the contour drawing).
                                              3) All horizontal dimensions are measured left or right of aircraft centerline (CL).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         6 OCTOBER 2011




                                              4) All vertical dimensions are measured from the top of the conveyor plane.
                                              5) Reference number of L100 for this contour assigned by IATA for easy identification.
                                              6) The specifications of airframe manufacturer and/or carrier will ALWAYS take precedence over this chart.
