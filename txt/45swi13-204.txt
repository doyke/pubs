SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include updates to organizational offices responsible for providing helicopter support (paragraph
1.), and clarifies responsibilities (paragraphs 2.1., 2.2.) and procedures for requesting support
(paragraph 3.1).
1. General: The mission of the 301st Rescue Squadron (RQS) includes supporting ER launch
area surveillance requirements with up to two (2) HH60G helicopters for ER launch operations
and maintaining a combat search and rescue capability in support of, and under the control of, its
parent organization (ACC). Mission priorities will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
 2                                                              45SWI13-204 30 January 2012


2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The 301 RQS Commander will maintain tactical control of the squadron’s aircraft,
     except when committed to support ER operations. During these periods, control of
     committed aircraft will be exercised through the ER Aerospace Control Officer, Surveillance
     Control Officer, or the Range Operations Commander, from the specified L-X time through
     published launch window times or termination of operation, whichever occurs first.
     2.2. Mission requirements of a recurring nature will be submitted in accordance with 45 SWI
     13-206, Eastern Range Scheduling, by the appropriate Program Support Manager (PSM), or
     by operational requirements documentation (in the case of support associated with Range
     operations).
     2.3. Other requirements for 301 RQS support (such as photo flights or personnel/supply
     airlift) and/or one-time requirements will be submitted according to 45SWI 13-206, Eastern
     Range Scheduling, as far in advance as possible to the 1st Range Operations Squadron,
     Scheduling Flight (1 ROPS/DOUS), to be forwarded to 301 RQS no later than two weeks
     prior to the date the support is required (whenever possible).
3. Procedures:
     3.1. The 1 ROPS/DOUS will consolidate both recurring and one-time requests and forward
     them by telephone to 301 RQS. If requested by the 301 RQS, a letter specifying the mission
     requirements will be sent to the 301 RQS/DO. This letter may come from 1 ROPS/DOUS or
     the user through 1 ROPS/DOUS. In determining whether a request can be honored, the
     following priority listing will be used as a guide:
        3.1.1. Actual rescue mission or emergency medical evacuation requests.
        3.1.2. Higher headquarters directed missions.
        3.1.3. Support of launch operations.
        3.1.4. Combat Search and Rescue Aircrew training requirements.
        3.1.5. Other missions, subject to availability.
     3.2. The 301 RQS Commander will determine if the requested support is within the
     squadron’s capability after considering safety factors, aircrew availability, maintenance
     status, and other factors. The 301 RQS Commander, or designated representative, is the final
     approval authority for all missions.
     3.3. Direct communication is encouraged between 1 ROPS/DOUS and 301 RQS Operations
     to resolve conflicts and problems arising in the conduct of, or approval for, launch area
     surveillance.
4. Reimbursement Procedures: Support to Range users rendered under this instruction is
subject to the reimbursement guidelines contained in 45SWI 65-601, Reimbursement Policy.
     4.1. Job Order Numbers (JON) for each mission will be provided to 920 RQW/FM by
     1 ROPS.

   4.2. The 920 MXG will provide the 920 RQW/FM with additional data necessary for
   required billing information.
