                               GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General
     1.1.1. The goal of the Airfield Driving Program is to ensure a safe airfield environment.
     Safe operation of motor vehicles on the airfield is essential to normal operations. Vehicle
     movements must be held to the absolute minimum consistent with mission requirements.

              AIRFIELD OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. General. Airfield markings, lights and signs are used to direct and control the movement of
aircraft and vehicles on the ground. All personnel involved with driving on the airfield must be
familiar with airfield markings, lights and signs to prevent aircraft impediments and runway
incursions.
   3.1.1. To enter the airfield (area past any Foreign Object Debris (FOD) check point),
   personnel must have a valid and current AF IMT 483, certified according to this instruction.
   3.1.2. The Controlled Movement Areas (CMA) includes both runways (06L/24R and
   06R/24L), all overruns, and any areas within 100 feet of these areas as defined by the runway
   hold lines. See Attachment 12 for a depiction of the CMAs.
       3.1.2.1. The CMA also includes the Instrument Landing System (ILS) Glideslope and
       Localizer Critical Areas when ILS stoplights are red or off. See Attachment 12 for a
       depiction of all ILS stoplight locations.
   3.1.3. The non-CMA includes all taxiways, aircraft parking locations and infield areas
   within the controlled airfield boundary with the exception of the hanger access road and
   parking lots, behind the hangers.
3.2. Controlled Movement Area Access and Emergency Removal Procedures.
   3.2.1. CMA access shall be limited to only properly qualified vehicle operators to perform
   mission essential airfield duties. At no time will any vehicle be operated in the CMA for the
   purpose of convenience. Vehicle operators will use East and West perimeter roads to the
   maximum extent possible to minimize non-essential vehicle movement crossing runways.
   3.2.2. For access in the CMA, vehicle operators will hold short (no closer than 30 feet) of all
   Visual Flight Rules (VFR) hold lines and CMA stop bars (access roads) and conduct a
   thorough visual check for approaching aircraft and vehicles, in all directions. Then vehicle
   operators will establish radio contact with Ground Control via the Airfield Net, or UHF
   Ground frequency, prior to requesting access to the CMA. Examples of phraseology found
   in Attachment 5.
       3.2.2.1. Vehicle operators requesting to cross the runway or access on the runway must
       state the runway crossing or access point and should include destination and expected
       duration.
       3.2.2.2. Once approved to enter the CMA, radio contact with Ground Control will be
       maintained at all times.
           3.2.2.2.1. Mobile cell phones do not meet the requirement for two-way radio
           communication. To ensure effective radio communications between Ground Control,
           all vehicles operating in the CMA should have a permanent UHF/VHF or Land
           Mobile Radios (LMR) mounted in the vehicle. A hand-held radio should only be
           used as a backup or when communication is required outside the vehicle.
36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014                                                                        15


  3.2.3. No one under any circumstance will proceed onto or across a CMA unless specifically
  approved to do so by Ground Control. CAUTION: DO NOT enter or cross the runway
  unless you have direct two-way radio contact with, and APPROVAL from Ground Control.
  3.2.4. Vehicle operators must not enter the ILS Critical Areas unless approved by and having
  two-way radio contact with Ground Control when the traffic light is red or off, see
  paragraph 3.14. for location, description, and procedures.
  3.2.5. Vehicle operators approved “up to the edge, but not on runway” is an approval inside
  a 100 foot distance from the runway edge. This is NOT approval to go on to the runway or
  any hard surface of the runway itself to include the shoulders and overruns.
  3.2.6. Vehicles operating in the CMA must use rotating beacon lights or emergency flashers.
  If a vehicle is not equipped with either it will be denied access or escorted by a properly lit
  vehicle while operating in the CMA.
  3.2.7. Ground Control has authority over all traffic (aircraft, vehicle, and pedestrian)
  entering the CMA and will issue specific instructions to control the movement of aircraft,
  vehicles, equipment, and/or personnel.
  3.2.8. Vehicle operators requiring CMA access will use the departure end of the runway to
  the maximum extent possible.
     3.2.8.1. In the event Ground Control has to relocate to the alternate facility, the only
     authorized access/crossing of the CMA will be from Taxiways H, J, or K. CAUTION:
     When crossing a runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point
     is the departure end of the runway in use.
  3.2.9. CMA Access Procedures for Convoy or Escorted Vehicles: Vehicles without two-
  way radio communication capability with ATCT must be escorted into the CMA by a
  properly certified vehicle operator with the proper radio equipment with the following
  additional requirements.
     3.2.9.1. The escort vehicle operator will obtain proper clearance for all vehicles from
     Ground Control prior to proceeding on or across the runway. Once given permission
     from Ground Control, the driver must communicate this approval to the escorted party.
         3.2.9.1.1. While escorting other vehicles, the escort will use the word “plus #” to
         include additional vehicles, e.g. Call Sign, Plus #, then state request.
     3.2.9.2. The escort vehicle must remain in lead position with escorted vehicles following
     in a close formation at all times. Escort and escorted vehicles must have a means to
     communicate between vehicles. The escort vehicle is responsible for the compliance of
     all escorted vehicles.
  3.2.10. Work details consisting of two or more persons will assign one individual to
  communicate specifically with Ground Control using two-way radio communication for
  CMA access. This individual will not communicate with any other persons/units (over a
  radio) while the work detail is in, or transiting through a CMA. It is the responsibility of the
  work detail to provide additional radios as required.
  3.2.11. Radio Discipline and Communication Procedures.
     3.2.11.1. An operational test of the radio shall be conducted prior to entering the airfield.
16                                                               36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014


     3.2.11.2. No communication with Ground Control is necessary at airfield entry access
     points (FOD check points).
     3.2.11.3. Keep all radio calls to a minimum and make each transmission, short and clear.
     Ultra UHF/VHF radio-equipped vehicles will only transmit on Ground Control. Do not
     use the Ramp Net for conversations between workers and work centers with the
     exception of AMOPS.
     3.2.11.4. Phrases using: “cleared”, “clear”, “clearance”, “go-ahead”, “ok”, or “go on”
     will not be used by airfield vehicle operators or controllers, and instructions must be
     verified prior to proceeding with a request. Do not use North or South runway when
     referring to Runway 06L/24R or Runway 06R/24L.
  3.2.12. Communication failure. In the event Ground Control loses radio contact with
  vehicles operating in the CMA, the runway lights will be flashed on and off at the highest
  setting and/or the ATCT light gun signals will be used. At that time, all vehicles will exit the
  CMA beyond the hold lines until radio contact can be re-established. If unable to contact
  Ground Control while in the CMA, exit the CMA immediately and use other available means
  to contact the tower. Call 366-4281 and advise Ground Control you are “off” the CMA and
  if you were experiencing radio problems. If this is not practical, then the driver, after
  vacating the runway, should turn the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle
  headlights and wait for the controller to signal with the light gun.
  3.2.13. Vehicle failure. When a vehicle has a malfunction, which prevents operation under
  its own power, every means will be used to alert aircraft. As a minimum, the vehicle
  operator will:
     3.2.13.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers ON.
     3.2.13.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, immediately contact Ground
     Control via the LMR “Airfield Net” or VHF/UHF radio (121.7/275.8), or contact
     AMOPS via the LMR “Ramp Net” or by calling 366-4188, to advise them of the
     situation, location of the vehicle, and include any pertinent information that might affect
     safe runway operations.
     3.2.13.3. If the vehicle is not equipped with a UHF/VHF radio or LMR, or the radio is
     non-operational, stay with the vehicle and attempt to flag down other radio equipped
     vehicles.
     3.2.13.4. Operators of other UHF/VHF or LMR equipped vehicles (Security Forces,
     Civil Engineering, Vehicle Operations, Transient Alert, etc.) will make every effort to
     assist getting the disabled vehicle off of the airfield.
     3.2.13.5. If you are unable to contact Ground Control or AMOPS remain with the
     vehicle and attempt to get the attention of taxiing aircraft.
     3.2.13.6. Disabled vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest and safest
     way possible.
  3.2.14. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ) area is established to provide aircraft
  performing a missed approach increased safety during low ceiling weather conditions. The
  POFZ area is an 800 feet wide by 200 feet long rectangular area centered on the runway
36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014                                                                      17


   centerline, beginning at and extending outward from the runway threshold. See Attachment
   12 for depiction.
       3.2.14.1. The POFZ areas require protection when the reported ceiling is less than 800
       feet and/or visibility is less than 2 miles. When these conditions exist the ATCT will
       activate ILS Critical Area lights and notify AMOPS who will publish a Notice to Airmen
       (NOTAM) closing Taxiway Foxtrot and place lighted barricades at Taxiway
       Foxtrot/Bravo, Foxtrot/Charlie, Foxtrot/Delta and Foxtrot/vehicle access road preventing
       aircraft/vehicles from entering POFZ areas. Additionally, to protect the POFZ area
       located on Taxiway Kilo North of Runway 06R/24L all aircraft and non-mission essential
       vehicles requiring access to or across the approach end of Runway 24L will be held at or
       not considered clear of the Runway 06L/24R until they are located at the intersection of
       Taxiway Kilo/Charlie.
       3.2.14.2. Mission essential vehicles less than 10 feet in height are authorized to operate
       within the POFZ areas. Mission essential is defined as any vehicle requiring access to
       CMA area for continued runway operations.
   3.2.15. The ATCT will notify AMOPS of any vehicles observed operating in the CMA not
   complying with the above procedures. Failure to follow the instructions of the ATCT, or
   noncompliance with CMA operating procedures will result in the immediate suspension of
   airfield driving privileges, until reviewed by AMOPS. See Chapter 4 for violation
   procedures.
3.3. Restricted/Control Areas. Restricted area Entry Control Points (ECPs) are marked with
white stripes inside of a black box and with “ECP” in white characters in the center of the box.

Figure 3.1. Entry Control Point Marking (ECP)




   3.3.1. To enter through the ECP, vehicles/pedestrians must have a valid USAF restricted
   area badge with Area #2 open, be escorted, or be listed on an approved Entry Authorization
   List (EAL). An approved EAL must be signed by 36 OSS/CC and authenticated by 36 SFS.
   3.3.2. Restricted areas are outlined by a red painted border and will not be driven or stepped
   across without prior coordination with 36 SFS.
 18                                                                 36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014


Figure 3.2. Restricted Area Marking




   3.3.3. Restricted areas are active any time an aircraft is present within the boundary of that
   particular restricted area.
   3.3.4. Refer to the Wing Integrated Defense Plan or contact 36 SFS for more details on
   specific controlled/restricted area procedures.
3.4. Vehicle Parking and Chocking.
   3.4.1. Vehicles and equipment will not be parked or left unattended within 1,000 feet of the
   runway or within 200 feet of taxiway centerlines unless directly supporting aircraft
   operations.
   3.4.2. Vehicles and equipment supporting aircraft operations will not be stopped, parked, or
   left unattended inside the taxi lane boundary line.
   3.4.3. Vehicles will not be backed or parked in the immediate vicinity (25 feet to front or
   200 feet to rear) of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading or
   unloading, servicing, or towing. A spotter will be posted when a vehicle is backed towards
   an aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from being backed
   into aircraft.
   3.4.4. The parking brake on all parked vehicles will be set.
   3.4.5. All unattended vehicles will be parked so they will not interfere with taxiing or towed
   aircraft. The vehicle ignition will be turned off, keys will be left in the ignition and the gear
   lever will be put in reverse gear for vehicles with manual transmissions and in the ‘park’
   position for vehicles with automatic transmissions. All vehicles parked and left unattended
   will have brakes set or will have chocks placed both in front of and behind one of the rear-
   wheels. One chock will be placed between the tandem wheels of dual (tandem) axle
   vehicles. The only vehicles exempt from these requirements are alert and emergency
   vehicles responding to an alert or emergency (i.e. ambulance and fire department).
   3.4.6. When aircraft engines are operating or being started, no vehicle will be parked or
   driven closer than 25 feet in front of, or 200 feet to the rear of the aircraft. Vehicles parked at
   the side of the aircraft will be located clear of the wingtips and clearly visible to personnel in
   the cockpit.
36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014                                                                        19


3.5. Vehicle Speed Limits.
   3.5.1. No vehicle will be operated at a speed in excess of that deemed reasonable for existing
   traffic, road, and weather conditions. The following speed limits apply to all vehicles:

Table 3.1. Andersen AFB Airfield Vehicle Speed Limits
 General airfield areas (taxiways, taxilanes, runways*)               20 mph
 Aircraft parking ramps, and restricted areas                         15 mph
 Vehicle parking areas                                                 5 mph
 Within 25 feet of an aircraft                                         5 mph
 Tow speed for aircraft and two or more maintenance stands             5 mph
 Tow speed for one maintenance stand                                  10 mph
 Maximum tow speed for AGE (e.g. power units, oxygen carts)           15 mph
 West and East Perimeter Roads                                        25 mph
 Access roads (behind hangars, golf road)                             15 mph
 * Non-emergency vehicles may be operated in excess of 20 mph on the runway in
 the interest of flight safety.
       3.5.1.1. If a vehicle is specifically restricted to a lower speed IAW AFMAN 24-306(I),
       Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Operation, those limits apply.
   3.5.2. Transient Alert Follow-Me vehicles may be operated in excess of speed limits only to
   accommodate the optimum safe taxiing speed of aircraft and when safety is not
   compromised.
   3.5.3. Driving within the CMA will be at a safe speed. If at any time Ground Control
   informs the operator to expedite off the runway due to arriving/departing aircraft, or other
   situation that requires the runway to be free of vehicles in a hurry, ground vehicle operators
   will depart the runway immediately at the nearest taxiway and at a safe speed.
3.6. Jet Blast.
   3.6.1. Drivers will not cross a taxiway or cross in front of an approaching aircraft that is
   within 200 feet or until the aircraft has passed by at least 200 feet.
   3.6.2. Drivers will remain at least 100 feet away from any helicopter with rotors in motion.
   3.6.3. Do not operate vehicles within 200 feet when the engines are running. CAUTION:
   Jet blast or prop wash can be extremely dangerous! Flashing beacons located on the tail, top,
   and/or bottom of the aircraft indicate the engine is running or about to start.
3.7. Vehicle Operations in the Immediate Vicinity of Aircraft.
   3.7.1. No vehicle will park in front of hangar doors. This area must be kept clear for aircraft
   towing operations and a minimum 25 feet wing-tip clearance must be maintained.
   3.7.2. Vehicles will not operate within 50 feet of fueling/de-fueling operations unless
   allowed by applicable aircraft Technical Order (T.O.).
   3.7.3. Do not drive vehicles within 10 feet (circle of safety) of a parked aircraft, except when
   being used to service, load, or unload the aircraft. When driving within the circle of safety, a
 20                                                                36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014


   spotter must be used. Anytime a vehicle is driven towards an aircraft, a pre-positioned wheel
   chock must be placed between the aircraft and vehicle to prevent hitting the aircraft.
   3.7.4. Taxiing Aircraft:
       3.7.4.1. Vehicles operating on taxiways/taxi lanes will remain clear of aircraft except for
       Transient Alert “Follow-Me” vehicles. Vehicles will not be parked in front of, or driven
       into the path of, taxiing aircraft. Additionally, vehicles will not be driven between a
       taxiing aircraft and its “Follow-Me” vehicle guide, or aircraft marshaller.
          3.7.4.1.1. If an aircraft marshaller is standing or posted in front of an aircraft and the
          aircraft is not ready to taxi, the marshaller may visually wave the traffic through the
          area between themselves and the aircraft. A minimum clearance of 25 feet must exist
          between the aircraft and the vehicle passing through the area.
       3.7.4.2. Helicopters may not be readily visible to vehicle drivers. Extra care must be
       taken to scan for taxiing helicopters especially on the North Ramp and during night
       3.7.4.3. Helicopters are considered taxiing when hovering 100 feet or less above the
       ground or when traversing down a taxiway. Do not drive under, between or around
       helicopters hovering 100 feet or less.
       3.7.4.4. During the hours of darkness (sunset to sunrise), headlights of a vehicle shining
       towards a moving aircraft will be turned OFF immediately so the pilot’s night vision is
       not affected. The vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on so its
       position is known. Headlights will remain OFF until the aircraft is out of range and then
       turned back on prior to putting the vehicle in motion.
       3.7.4.5. All vehicle drivers who operate on the parking ramp/apron and taxiways will
       give way to taxiing and towed aircraft. The responsibility to avoid aircraft rests with
       vehicle operators. Vehicle operators encountering an aircraft in front or behind will exit
       the taxiway by the shortest route and, if necessary, reverse course to quickly move out of
       the way. Only as a last resort should the vehicle be driven off prepared surfaces; ensure
       adequate wingtip clearance for the aircraft at all times. Adequate wingtip clearance is a
       minimum of 25 feet. A FOD check is required prior to movement back onto a taxiway.

Figure 3.3. Example of area visibility from an aircraft flight deck


                          1.   The gray shaded area indicates areas on the ground NOT
                               VISIBLE from the flight deck.

                          2.   The white area indicates areas on the ground VISIBLE
                               from the flight deck.


       3.7.4.6. Vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all aircraft and:
          3.7.4.6.1. Will not cross a taxiway or cross in front of an approaching aircraft that is
          within 200 feet or until the aircraft have passed by at least 200 feet.
36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014                                                                        21


          3.7.4.6.2. Will remain at least 100 feet away from any helicopter with rotors in
          motion.
          3.7.4.6.3. Will yield the right-of-way to all emergency response and alert vehicles,
          with rotating lights, in motion.
          3.7.4.6.4. Will yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already operating on a taxiway
          they wish to enter or cross.
      3.7.4.7. When a vehicle has a malfunction which prevents operation under its own
      power, every means will be used to alert taxiing aircraft. See paragraph 3.2.13. for
      procedures.
3.8. Towing/Taxiing/Engine Run Operations.
   3.8.1. Any vehicle that encounters taxiing or towing operations will move off the taxi lane
   behind the taxi lane boundary line (see Figure 3.9) that runs across the parking spots, parallel
   to taxiway centerline.
   3.8.2. AMOPS is the approving authority for all engine run and aircraft movement
   operations. Notification of aircraft engine run-ups, towing, and taxiing will be provided to
   Ground Control by AMOPS. Maintenance Operations Control Centers (MOCC) will be the
   focal point for aircrew or maintenance personnel to request engine runs, tows, or taxi
   requests; MOCC will provide AMOPS with the information.
   3.8.3. After receiving approval from AMOPS, MOCC will advise aircrews requesting taxi or
   engine runs to contact Ground Control on 121.7/275.8 or the Airfield Net for engine start.
   3.8.4. Ground personnel requesting towing, taxi, or engine run operations will contact
   MOCC via phone (366-4321) for coordination, and upon approval contact Ground Control
   via 121.7/275.8 the Airfield Net or via 121.7/275.8 on a VHF/UHF equipped radio prior to
   initiation. AMOPS will notify 36 SFS via phone (366-2910) or hotline of all engine runs and
   towing operations once requested via MOCC.
   3.8.5. Maintenance personnel will monitor frequencies 121.7/275.8 or the Airfield Net
   during towing operations.
      3.8.5.1. During airfield closure hours all the items normally approved by AMOPS or
      ATC will be routed through the Command Post for approval and coordination, refer to 36
      WGI 13-204, Airfield Operations Instruction, for movement area and engine run/aircraft
      tow procedures during airfield closures.
3.9. Emergency Vehicle Operations.
   3.9.1. Vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all emergency and fire/crash vehicles
   with emergency flashers/rotating lights in motion.
   3.9.2. Vehicles not in direct support of the emergency will remain clear of taxiways,
   runways, and airfield access points until the emergency is terminated.
   3.9.3. During response to in-flight/ground emergencies limit runway access/crossings for
   secondary agencies until specifically required to operate within the CMA as determined by
   the Incident Commander or Fire Chief. Response vehicles may use the most advantageous
   route to their required location.
 22                                                               36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014


   3.9.4. Regardless of circumstances, all vehicle operators accessing the CMA must obtain
   approval from Ground Control, or be escorted by another vehicle who has obtained approval
   for the escorted vehicle through Ground Control.
3.10. Aircraft Ground Equipment Operations.
   3.10.1. All wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment will be chocked if not equipped with
   an integrated brake system.
   3.10.2. Mobile ground support equipment is exempt from aircraft clearance distance criteria.
   When such equipment is NOT in use, it must be removed from the taxiways and apron edges,
   and stored in areas that do not violate aircraft clearance requirements.
       3.10.2.1. Equipment is defined as support equipment in place not more than three hours
       before aircraft arrival or three hours after aircraft departure.
3.11. Restricted Visibility and Night Operations.
   3.11.1. Headlights will be turned on from sunset to sunrise, and during periods of inclement
   weather or reduced visibility. Flashing lights or parking lights will also be used at night
   when vehicles are temporarily parked on any part of the airfield. This does not apply if a
   vehicle is parked in a designated area.
   3.11.2. When visibility is less than 300 feet, refueling and explosive loaded (laden) vehicles
   will not be operated unless directed by the 36 WG/CC.
   3.11.3. When visibility is less than 100 feet, POVs and airfield vehicles (except emergency
   response and alert vehicles) will not be operated on the airfield. Flashing/hazard lights will
   be used on all vehicles temporarily parked on the airfield during periods of reduced visibility.
   Vehicle operators will use a walking guide equipped with a flashlight or luminescent wand.
   3.11.4. When visibility is less than 50 feet, only emergency movement of alert vehicles is
   authorized. Vehicle operators will use a walking guide equipped with a flashlight or a
   luminescent ward.
   3.11.5. Vehicle operators will exercise caution to ensure headlights do not point toward
   taxiing aircraft or towing operations so aircraft and tow vehicle operators are not blinded.
3.12. Daytime Running Lights.
   3.12.1. Daytime Running Lights (DRLs). DRLs cannot be turned off by simply switching
   off the headlights; they must be turned off by stopping the vehicle, shifting to the “park”
   position and applying the brake. Vehicle operators should review the vehicle operating
   manual.
   3.12.2. Vehicles with DRLs that cannot be disabled, will park outside the wingtip clearance
   line, with ignition off, parking brake set, and emergency flashers on.
3.13. Control Tower Light Gun Signals.
   3.13.1. Light signals are used to control aircraft and vehicles on the airfield when
   communications cannot be established. All vehicles operating on the airfield must be
   equipped with an ATCT light gun signal decal (AFVA 11-240). These decals may be
   obtained from http://www.e-publishing.af.mil or http://www.faa.gov/runwaysafety/ (see
   Attachment 10). The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped
36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014                                                                        23


   to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be flipped down for
   ready reference. Do not confuse the airport-rotating beacon with the light gun flashes.
   3.13.2. All vehicle operators will know and comply with the following signals:
       3.13.2.1. Steady Green Light: “Clear to cross”
       3.13.2.2. Steady Red Light: “STOP! Vehicle will not be moved”
       3.13.2.3. Flashing Red Light: “Clear active runway”
       3.13.2.4. Flashing White Light: “Return to starting point”
       3.13.2.5. Red and Green Light: “General warning. Exercise extreme caution”
          3.13.2.5.1. During alerts and emergency conditions, all non-essential personnel will
          withdraw to AMOPS or their Work Control Center until the emergency is terminated.
          The withdrawal of contractors and civilians will be at the discretion of the Fire
          Department.
3.14. ILS Critical Areas: Description, Location, Identification, and Vehicle Operating
Procedures.
   3.14.1. Description and Location. The ILS critical areas consist of both a critical area for the
   localizers and the glideslopes.
       3.14.1.1. The ILS Localizer critical areas are located at the east and west ends of both
       Runways, which passes through the East and West Perimeter roads, see Attachment 11.
       3.14.1.2. The ILS Glideslope critical area are located to the north of each runway,
       approximately 1,000 feet from the runway threshold. The Glideslope critical areas are
       fan shaped and do cross roads and taxiways, see Attachment 11.
   3.14.2. Identification. The ILS critical areas are identified by vehicle traffic lights and/or
   Instrument hold lines.
       3.14.2.1. Vehicle traffic lights with red and green lights are positioned at four locations
       on East perimeter road, two locations on West perimeter road, east of parking spot N-7
       on Taxi lane Delta, and Taxi lane Charlie near Taxiway Foxtrot and Kilo, see Attachment
       12.

Figure 3.4. ILS Critical Area Vehicle Traffic Light
 24                                                               36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014


      3.14.2.2. Instrument Hold Lines, see Figure 3.6, are located on both ends of Taxi lane
      Charlie near Taxiway Foxtrot intersection and near Taxiway K intersection, on Taxi lane
      Delta near the Taxiway Echo/Foxtrot intersection, on Delta loop near the Taxiway
      Echo/Foxtrot intersection, and on Taxiway Foxtrot between the runways.
   3.14.3. ILS Critical Area Vehicle Operating Procedures.
      3.14.3.1. Vehicles that transit through the ILS Critical Area via the ILS stoplights can
      proceed through the area without delay when the light is green and do not need Ground
      Control approval or two-way radio contact with Ground Control.
      3.14.3.2. When the light is red or off, vehicles must not enter the ILS Critical Areas
      unless approved by Ground Control. Two-way radio contact must be maintained with
      Ground Control. If the traffic light is red for 10 minutes or more contact Ground Control
      via the Airfield Net.
      3.14.3.3. Vehicles entering an ILS critical area from access points without an ILS
      stoplight or from non-CMAs, must obtain approval from Ground Control prior to
      entering the critical area and maintain two-way radio contact with Ground Control. For
      example, vehicles on Runway 06L/24R exiting off on to Taxiway F must establish
      approval from Ground Control prior to entering the ILS critical area.
3.15. Airfield Markings.
   3.15.1. Runway Hold Line: A position beyond which, a vehicle cannot proceed without
   Ground Control approval. These markings are positioned on all taxiways that intersect a
   runway. The marking consists of four parallel yellow stripes parallel to the runway
   centerline and extending across the taxiway and shoulders. The two stripes closest to the
   runway are two dashed lines and the two furthest from the runway are solid yellow lines. A
   runway hold sign is also located on each side of the taxiway.

Figure 3.5. Runway Hold Line Marking




   3.15.2. Instrument Hold line: A position beyond which an aircraft or vehicle cannot proceed
   without Ground Control approval during periods when the reported ceiling is less than 800
   feet and/or the visibility is less than 2 miles. The marking consists of two solid yellow
   parallel stripes perpendicular to axis of taxiway centerline with double vertical stripes spaced
   ten feet between pairs. Vertical stripes of a pair are spaced 2 feet apart. Six foot high block
   letters “INST” are painted on the runway side of the line, left of the taxiway centerline, to be
   read facing the runway and indicate to hold during “instrument” conditions. An instrument
   hold sign is located on each side of the taxiway.

       3.15.2.1. Instrument Hold lines are used to protect any NAVAID critical area, as
       required. These instrument hold lines are only required to protect the ILS Glideslope
       signal at all locations where the fan shaped critical area crosses roads and taxiways on the
       airfield. The hold lines are located on Taxiway F between the runways, on Taxi lane C
       near the Taxiway F intersection, and on the access road between Taxiway E and Taxiway
       F.
   3.15.3. Runway Hold Stop Bar: This hold bar is a three-foot white stripe painted on vehicle
   access roads that lead onto a runway.

   3.15.5. Restricted Area Boundary Markings: A solid red line used to designate restricted
   areas. Vehicles requiring access to, or from, restricted areas will do so through designated
   ECPs.
   3.15.6. Taxi lane Boundary Line: Two dashed 6 inch yellow striped lines and two 6-inch
   wide yellow stripes striated that runs parallel to the taxiway centerline at the front of all
   aircraft parking spots and hangars for wingtip clearance.

Figure 3.9. Taxi lane Boundary Line Marking




       3.15.6.1. Approval must be obtained from AMOPS prior to parking anything closer than
       the taxi lane boundary line to the centerline of a taxiway. This approval will normally
       close that portion of the taxiway to taxiing aircraft.

       3.16.2.5. Airport Rotating Beacon: Green and split (double peaked) white light. The
       beacon is ON during the hours of darkness or inclement weather and is located south of
       South Ramp 6 along Arc Light Boulevard.
3.17. Control Tower Blind Spots. There are several locations on the airfield where the ATCT
cannot visually observe a vehicle on the airfield. These areas are identified on Attachment 11.
3.18. Foreign Object Damage Control and Prevention.
   3.18.1. All airfield personnel have a responsibility in the FOD Control Program to remove
   debris from the airfield. AMOPS is the focal point for notifying the airfield sweeper for all
   sweeping requests on the airfield. When FOD is found and cannot be picked up immediately
   by the observer, contact AMOPS at 366-4188 or the Ramp Net (call sign “Airfield Ops” to
   report observed FOD.
   3.18.2. Procedures for FOD checks:
       3.18.2.1. Inspection of vehicle tires (pull forward to check tire in contact with
       pavement). Remove foreign materials (e.g., rocks, gravel, etc.) as applicable.
       3.18.2.2. A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components are secured. Secure
       any/all items loaded on payload vehicle, including all tie down device loose ends such as
       chains, ropes, packaging or other item that may become dislodged during movement
       while on the airfield.
       3.18.2.3. A thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose, or worn
       parts.
   3.18.3. When motor vehicles are operated on unpaved surfaces, rocks may become lodged
   between dual wheels and gravel may stick in the tire treads. For this reason, paved access
   roads will be utilized for all vehicles transitioning to and from the airfield. All-terrain
   vehicles will remain clear of the airfield unless mission essential.
   3.18.4. Airfield vehicle operators will ensure all equipment transported in/on a vehicle is
   properly stored and secured. Vehicles operating on the airfield will have a FOD container,
   FOD removal tool and a flashlight.
   3.18.5. Vehicles will be operated on paved surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If
   operating on an unpaved surface is absolutely necessary, vehicle operators will check tires
   and remove foreign objects immediately after returning to a paved surface.
       3.18.5.1. Deteriorating asphalt shoulders and closed parking spots on the airfield also
       present a potential for FOD. Vehicle operators will perform tire checks for loose
       aggregate when transitioning from these surfaces.
 30                                                               36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014


   3.18.6. Hats will not be worn in the airfield controlled area. Line badges must also be
   properly secured while working on the airfield.
3.19. Lateral Distance Requirements for Mobile Obstacles on Runways, Taxiways, and
Aprons.
   3.19.1. A mobile obstacle is anything posing a threat to aircraft movements, e.g., fire bottles,
   maintenance stands, vehicles, AGE, etc.
   3.19.2. Obstacles must remain at least 1,000 feet from runway centerlines, 200 feet from
   taxiway centerlines, 125 feet from the edge of aprons and behind taxi lane boundary lines
   when not directly supporting aircraft operations.
   3.19.3. The 125 foot apron clearance requirement does not apply to equipment pre-
   positioned for aircraft recovery which must be parked clear of roadways and taxi/tow lines,
   nor to AGE equipment in established equipment parking areas. Regardless, all equipment
   and vehicles must be parked/positioned off the taxiways outside of the taxi lane boundary
   line.
   3.19.4. Equipment may be pre-positioned on parking ramps or hardstands no more than three
   hours before aircraft arrival or three hours after aircraft departure.
   3.19.5. If mission necessity or manning restrictions require the pre-positioning of equipment
   outside the authorized window, the servicing unit (maintenance control center) must
   coordinate with and receive AMOPS approval before staging the equipment.
3.20. Procedures for Pedestrian Movement on the Airfield.
   3.20.1. Pedestrians on the airfield must be airfield driving qualified and have an AF IMT
   483, on their possession when on the airfield or be accompanied by someone who meets
   these requirements, for example a member of a Security Forces walking patrol.
   3.20.2. Pedestrian movement on the airfield will be kept to a minimum and is only
   authorized for official business in support of the flying mission.
   3.20.3. Pedestrians will walk facing oncoming traffic vehicle traffic.
   3.20.4. Pedestrians will not sit or recline on the ramp in such a manner that interferes with
   normal ground vehicle and aircraft operations and under no circumstance shall a pedestrian
   enter the CMA without two-way radio contact and approval from Ground Control.
3.21. Procedures and/or Restriction for Operating Motorcycles, Mopeds or Scooters,
Bicycles, Tricycles and Other Vehicles.
   3.21.1. Jogging or any other form of physical fitness or sporting activities is strictly
   prohibited on the airfield unless authorized by the 36 WG/CC.

3.23. Vehicle Supplemental Traction Control Devices. Vehicle traction devices are not
authorized on the airfield (e.g., snow chains, studded tires, etc.).
3.24. Call Signs for Vehicles Operating Within the Controlled Movement Area. Each
vehicle operating in the CMA will have a call sign identifying the vehicle. AMOPS will assign
and/or approve all call signs and coordinate with Ground Control to ensure duplicates are not
used. See Attachment 6 for vehicle call signs that normally operate in the CMA to include call
signs for deployed units.
3.25. Procedures to Use Perimeter, Infield and/or Other Airfield Routes.
   3.25.1. Vehicle operators will drive along the far right edge of the taxiway just inside the
   double yellow taxiway edge stripe. Vehicle operators will not drive on the taxiway
   centerline unless specifically checking the pavement condition, checking for FOD, sweeping
   the taxiway, or towing aircraft (see Figure 3.18. for depiction).

        REPORTING, ENFORCEMENT, AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

4.1. General. All personnel operating on the airfield are responsible for identifying airfield
driving violations. Report all violations to AMOPS and 36 SFS immediately.
   4.1.1. Gross or repeated violations of safety or airfield driving rules, or an overall
   demonstrated lack of ability on the part of the vehicle operator will result in a suspension or
   revocation of airfield driving privileges. Common reasons for suspension include speeding,
   reckless driving, misuse/abuse of the vehicle, physical/mental impairment, display of poor
   judgment or behavior, poor FOD checks, and unsafe acts or behavior.
4.2. Controlled Movement Area Violations.
   4.2.1. A CMA violation (CMAV) event is an airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles,
   or pedestrians entering the CMA without specific approval from Ground Control. This
   definition also includes runway incursions.
   4.2.2. All CMAVs must be immediately reported to AMOPS. AMOPS will respond and
   escort the individual(s) back to AMOPS for debriefing. The 36 WG/ADPM will notify the
   36 OSS/CC, 36 WG/SE, applicable Unit Commander and Unit ADPM. Ground Control
   and/or AMOPS will complete an AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report, or AF Form 651,
   Hazardous Air Traffic Report, and provide a copy to the 36 WG/ADPM. AMOPS will take
   immediate action to correct problem or apply interim control measures to prevent further
   similar CMA violations.
   4.2.3. The AF Form 651 and/or AF Form 457 narrative section must include the information
   specified in AFI 13-213, paragraph 3.2.8.3.2.6.
   4.2.4. Airfield Management will notify PACAF/A3TO within 24 hours of all CMAV
   incidents.
   4.2.5. Airfield Management will notify 36 WG/SE of all CMAV incidents IAW AFI 91-202.
   4.2.6. All runway incursions will be assigned an operational category defined in Attachment
   1 for trend analysis.
       4.2.6.1. The AOF/CC, 36 WG/SE and 36 WG/ADPM will work as a team to assign all
       runway incursions an operational category (e.g., Operational Error, Pilot Deviation or
       Vehicle/Pedestrian) for trend analysis. The AOF/CC will ensure these classifications are
       annotated in the recommendation section of the AF Form 457 or AF Form 651.
   4.2.7. The 36 WG/ADPM is responsible for taking immediate actions to correct any
   systematic problems and ensuring interim control measures are applied until permanent
   corrections are made.
   4.2.8. The 36 WG/ADPM and 36 WG/SE must inspect the violator’s unit airfield driving
   program as a part of the runway incursion investigation. Emphasis will be placed on how the
   unit trained the individual and their compliance with the ADI. The results will be reported to
   the Unit Commander.
36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014                                                                       33


   4.2.9. The 36 WG/ADPM will investigate the CMAV and report findings to the AFM and
   36 WG/SE. The results of the investigation will then be forwarded to the responsible Unit
   ADPM through the AFM or designated representative who will recommend the course of
   action or if additional program control measures should be locally implemented. Should the
   driver’s privileges be revoked, the individual will be required to re-accomplish all training
   requirements outlined in this instruction for driving privileges to be reinstated. A subsequent
   CMA violation could result in a permanent suspension of airfield driving privileges.
      4.2.9.1. A detailed description to include (who, what, when, where and how, type
      vehicle/aircraft involved, action taken to prevent a reoccurrence) of all runway intrusions
      and CMAVs will be briefed during the quarterly Airfield Operations Board. Any airfield
      driving violation trends will be highlighted and a comparison will be given of current and
      past year violations by quarter.
      4.2.9.2. An event description and lessons learned synopsis will be sent to all unit airfield
      driving program managers and TDY units within three duty days. Unit airfield driving
      program manager will brief this information to all unit airfield drivers to prevent
      reoccurrence.
4.3. Confiscating, Suspending, Revoking, and Reissuing AF IMT 483, Certificate of
Competency.

      4.3.2.1. First Violation. Driving privileges may be suspended a minimum of 7 days and
      a maximum of 30 days as determined by the AFM or 36 WG/ADPM, depending on the
      nature of the violation. Additional training will be directed by AMOPS specific to the
      violation. Training must be completed by the Unit ADPM and documented on a memo to
      36 WG/ADPM (Attachment 15). Driver may resume airfield driving duties once
      suspension time is over and additional training has been accomplished.
      4.3.2.2. Second Violation. Driving privileges will be suspended for a minimum of 30
      days and a maximum of 6 months as determined by the AFM or 36 WG/ADPM.
      Additional training will be directed by AMOPS specific to the violation. Training must
      be completed by the Unit ADPM and documented on a memo endorsed by Unit
      Commander to 36 WG/ADPM (Attachment 15). The driver may resume airfield driving
      duties once suspension time is over and additional training has been accomplished.
      4.3.2.3. Third Violation. Any driver committing a third violation will have their driving
      privileges revoked for the remainder of the individual’s assignment.
   4.3.3. Suspension/Revocation: Unit Commanders, Unit ADPMs and AMOPS personnel
   have authority to suspend or revoke airfield driving privileges for personnel assigned to their
   unit without waiting for a third violation. If AMOPS suspends or revokes privileges, the 36
   WG/ADPM must notify the Unit Commander and unit ADPM. If a unit suspends or revokes
34                                                            36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014


  privileges, the Unit Commander must notify both the 36 WG/ADPM and unit ADPM in
  writing (Attachment 15) and provide a courtesy copy to 36 WG/SE and the 36 OSS/CC.
  4.3.4. Reinstatement Procedures: A Unit Commander requesting reinstatement of airfield
  driving privileges must submit a written request to 36 WG/ADPM for consideration. This
  request must identify completion of retraining for correct ground vehicle operations on the
  airfield. Training completion will be documented in a memo, signed by the Unit
  Commander, and forwarded to the 36 WG/ADPM for approval/disapproval. If the request is
  following a third violation the written request must be submitted through the 36 WG/ADPM
  and 36 OG/CC to 36 WG/CC.

                           NON-BASE ASSIGNED PERSONNEL

5.1. General. Non-base assigned personnel include Temporary Duty (TDY), deployed, and
contractor personnel.
   5.1.1. Non-base assigned personnel that require driving within the confines of the Airfield
   Controlled Area, inclusive of the CMA, require full airfield driving training and certification
   IAW Chapter 2 of this instruction prior to driving on the airfield, or they will be escorted by
   a properly trained individual.
      5.1.1.1. Airfield Driving training, to include all testing and practical evaluations will be
      provided by host Unit ADPM.
      5.1.1.2. Sponsoring units or agencies will provide an airfield driving qualified escort for
      untrained personnel working on the airfield. Personnel acting as an escort must maintain
      positive control of all escorted personnel working on or near the airfield. AMOPS does
      not provide airfield escorts for personnel requiring access to the airfield.
5.2. TDY/Deployed Personnel.
   5.2.1. Personnel TDY to Andersen for seven days or less will utilize Transient Alert or
   DZSP21 transportation to and from the airfield or be escorted by a qualified airfield driver.
   Airfield driving training may be requested for unique situations to meet operational
   requirements.
      5.2.1.1. Training is not required for drivers under escort. A single escort shall escort no
      more than four vehicles onto the airfield.
   5.2.2. All individuals with a valid need to operate a vehicle on the airfield must possess an
   AF IMT 483 or service equivalent, from their home station. Personnel without a valid AF
   IMT 483 issued from home station must accomplish all training IAW paragraph 2.2.
   5.2.3. Personnel must receive local training from a designated unit trainer through
   sponsoring unit program manager, which includes all local training items listed in
   Attachment 3. Once training is complete and the briefing sheet endorsed by sponsoring host
   unit trainer and the TDY driver, they will report to AMOPS. AMOPS will verify training has
   been completed, then sign and stamp the drivers briefing sheet. The original briefing sheet
   will be maintained by the driver to provide proof of training and must be carried on their
   person while driving on the airfield.
      5.2.3.1. Units deployed to AAFB without a host unit will request the AFM or
      36 WG/ADPM to appoint in writing one individual to act as the ADPM. This ADPM
      will be trained by AMOPS and will then be responsible for training the remaining
      deployed unit members. The ADPM will complete local training sheets for deployed
      drivers and then route completed paperwork and the individual’s AF IMT 483 to AMOPs
      for processing. Deployed units will minimize the number of airfield drivers to the
      absolute minimum required to perform their mission.
   5.2.4. Any driver operating a vehicle on the airfield without an AF IMT 483 will forfeit
   driving privileges for the duration of the TDY/Deployment.
 36                                                               36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014


   5.2.5. Personnel due for annual refresher training while TDY or deployed to AAFB must
   complete refresher training. Failure to do so will result in an invalidated AF IMT 483 and
   loss of airfield driving privileges.
5.3. Non-Base Assigned Contract Personnel:
   5.3.1. Contractors operating on the airfield will possess a valid civilian driver’s license and
   must receive airfield driving qualification training IAW paragraph 2.2., or be escorted by a
   qualified airfield driving escort before operating any vehicles or equipment on the airfield.

      driving procedures and maintain positive control of all contractors working on or near the
      airfield.
   5.3.2. Any contractor performing work in excess of 12-months and has a site office on
   AAFB, must appoint an ADPM and comply with all provisions outlined in this instruction.
   The contractor appointed ADPM is responsible for training and certifying all subcontractors
   under their control. Any contractor that satisfies full certification requirement and continues
   work on the airfield beyond the initial 1-year certification will require refresher training IAW
   Chapter 2.
   5.3.3. Contractors should minimize requests for full airfield driving privileges. Requests for
   full training and certification must be approved by the site superintendent, or foreman for all
   personnel tasked with driving on the airfield. Units sponsoring or Non-base assigned
   contractors are responsible for providing training or an escort that possesses a valid AF IMT
   483.
      5.3.3.1. If the contractor elects full certifications, then they will be responsible for
      oversight during the remaining period of work.
   5.3.4. Contractor Vehicles must have the company’s logo prominently displayed on the

                    PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE (POV) PASSES

6.1. Procedures for Issuing POV Passes/Decals.
   6.1.1. POV access to the airfield is prohibited without an approved vehicle pass issued by
   AMOPS. The AFM or 36 WG/ADPM will approve and strictly control airfield passes to
   ensure the number of passes issued is kept to a minimum. POV passes will not be approved
   if military transportation is available and/or airfield entry is not for official business.
      6.1.1.1. Government leased vehicles marked by DZSP-21 and containing an AF Form
      1800, are not required to obtain a POV pass and are treated as a GOVs.
      6.1.1.2. Leased vehicles from local rental agencies are considered as POVs for airfield
      access purposes and require a POV pass.
   6.1.2. Submit the “Andersen AFB Airfield POV Pass Request Form” (Attachment 7) to
   AMOPS providing justification and Unit Commander approval. This form must contain the
   requestor’s name, organization, office symbol, duty title, duty phone, and an attached copy of
   the vehicle’s registration. For airfield construction projects, include unit/company, project,
   and contract number, and contract completion date.
      6.1.2.1. POV passes are non-transferable. The license plate number on the vehicle must
      correspond with the license plate number for the POV pass.
      6.1.2.2. 36 OSS/ OSAM Form 2, Andersen AFB Temporary/Annual POV Airfield Pass
      (Attachment 8), are displayed on the left side of the dashboard so it is clearly visible.
      POV’s not displaying a pass or POVs operating in areas other than designated, will be
      escorted or towed off the airfield by AMOPS, 36 SFS, and/or Transient Alert.
   6.1.3. Annual POV passes are valid from the date of issue until 31 December of the year
   originally issued, at which time they must be reprocessed in order to maintain POV airfield
   access privileges. The POV pass color will be changed annually to ensure program integrity.
   6.1.4. Temporary POV passes are provided to contractors performing work on the airfield or
   to TDY personnel with a valid need to drive on the airfield. POV Passes issued in support of
   construction or special projects will be issued for the duration of the project, but limited to
   the construction site area or specific project.
6.2. POV Passes for Deployment/TDY Personnel. For deployment/TDY personnel: passes
will be limited to one POV pass per two fighter type aircraft and one POV pass per
cargo/bomber type aircraft. The AFM is the waiver authority for this requirement.
6.3. Procedures for Disposition of POV Passes. Passes will be returned to AMOPS upon
completion of the TDY/deployment, construction/special project, or when no longer required.

                                  QUALITY CONTROL

7.1. Unit Airfield Driving Program Inspections.
   7.1.1. The 36 WG/ADPM will conduct inspections of all unit airfield driving programs
   annually, as requested by Unit Commanders, or depending on the program’s compliance with
   AFI 13-213 and 36 WGI13-213.
   7.1.2. Programs will be inspected using AFI 13-213 Attachment 4, Unit Airfield Driver
   program Self Inspection Checklist to verify airfield driving programs are in compliance with
   established directives.
   7.1.3. Inspection results will be forwarded to the respective Unit Commander for signature
   and the unit ADPM for information and/or action. Inspection results will be briefed at the
   quarterly AOB.
      7.1.3.1. A rating of either satisfactory or unsatisfactory will be given based on the
      programs overall compliance, integrity and ability to promote safe airfield driving within
      the unit.
          7.1.3.1.1. Programs found to be unsatisfactory will be reevaluated by the 36
          WG/ADPM within 60 calendar days of the previous inspection.
          7.1.3.1.2. Programs found unsatisfactory for a third consecutive inspection will have
          their AF IMT 483 processing suspended until corrective action is taken to address
          deficient requirements. Unit ADPMs will have 30 calendar days to correct
          documented discrepancies and request reinstatement of their respective unit’s
          program.
              7.1.3.1.2.1. The 36 WG/ADPM will notify unit ADPMs and the respective Unit
              Commander of program suspensions in writing within 7 calendar days.
              7.1.3.1.2.2. After the unit ADPM corrects all discrepancies the respective Unit
              Commander will request reinstatement of the suspended program. The 36
              WG/ADPM will re-inspect the suspended program within 15 calendar days of this
              reinstatement request, and then notify the unit ADPM and Unit Commander of
              reinstatement actions.

Terms
AF IMT 483, Certificate of Competency—The form issued to airfield drivers after undergoing
airfield drivers training IAW this instruction. The AF IMT 483 is valid until PCS and must be
revalidated every 12 months.
Airfield Facilities—Includes runways, taxiways, aircraft parking and servicing areas, ATC
facilities, AMOPS, ATCALS, aircraft fire suppression and rescue services, airfield lighting
systems, and systems to hold or stop aircraft (where required).
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—Any portion of the airfield that requires aircraft, vehicles
and pedestrians to obtain ATC approval to access. All vehicles operating within the CMA will
maintain two-way radio contact with the control tower, or have an escort with this capability
while in the CMA. In the event of radio failure, the CMA must be vacated immediately. The
CMA consists of all runways, overruns, and all areas within 100 feet of these areas as defined by
the runway hold lines. Note: Vehicles operating in the CMA must use rotating beacon lights or
hazard/warning lights.
36WGI13-213 10 JUNE 2014                                                                     41


Controlled Movement Area Violation—An airfield infraction caused by aircraft, vehicles, or
pedestrians entering the CMA without specific Ground Control approval. This definition
includes runway incursions and infractions caused by communication errors.
Emergency Vehicles—Vehicles equipped with rotating beacons that respond to aircraft or
airfield emergencies.
Government Vehicles (GOV)—Government-owned or leased vehicles operated on the airfield
consistent with operational needs. Government-owned golf carts, utility vehicles and registered
equipment on the airfield are classified as GOVs. Note: Authorization of a rental car on TDY
orders does not authorize its use on the airfield.
Mobile Obstacle—Vehicle, AGE, or equipment, etc., that is not a safe distance from or violates
aircraft or imaginary surface obstacle clearance criteria.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
take-off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the
CMA. These are further classified into three operational categories: Operational Error, Pilot
Deviation, or Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation.
Taxilane or Taxiway—A designated path marked through parking, maintenance, or hangar
aprons or on the perimeter of aprons to permit the safe movement of aircraft operating under
their own power. For the purpose of this instruction, taxi lane and taxiway are used
interchangeably.

                        EXAMPLES OF RADIO PHRASEOLOGY

A5.1. Radio Communication Procedures.
   A5.1.1. Think about what you are going to say before calling the tower.
   A5.1.2. Know and use proper phraseology. (Refer to the Aviation Phraseology and Aviation
   Alphabet at the end of this section.) Never use Citizen’s Band (CB) lingo or law
   enforcement “ten” codes.
   A5.1.3. Use the proper sequence in calling Ground Control. Before you start talking, make
   sure no one else is already talking. Then key your microphone and do the following:
      A5.1.3.1. State who you are calling and identify yourself by using your vehicle call sign.
      Example: “Andersen Ground, Airfield Two”
      A5.1.3.2. Wait for the tower controller to respond. Be patient, as it sometimes takes a
      while if the controller is busy. When the controller responds, “Airfield Two, Ground,”
      state where you are and where you want to go. Example: “Airfield Two on Taxiway
      Alpha. Request access onto Runway (06R/L or 24R/L) .” NOTE: The order in which you
      state where you are and where you want to go is unimportant. You can easily state where
      you want to go and where you are located instead. For example, “Airfield Two requests
      access onto runway (06R/L or 24R/L) from taxiway Echo.” The important thing to
      remember is BOTH pieces of information are required—where you are and where you’re
      going.
      A5.1.3.3. Wait for the controller’s response. The Ground Controller will either approve
      or deny your request, or give you modified instructions. Example: “Airfield One,
      proceed onto the runway. Report when off.”
      A5.1.3.4. ALWAYS read back instructions from the tower before proceeding. Example:
      “Airfield One proceeding onto the runway. Will report when off.” CAUTION: DO
      NOT use the word “clear” when reporting off the CMA/runway. This word is reserved
      for pilots and air traffic controllers only!
