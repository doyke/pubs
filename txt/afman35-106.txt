guideline. Refer to Attachment 1 for a glossary of references, acronyms and terms. Refer to
Attachment 2 for a table of honors. Refer to Attachment 3 for contact information for offices
regarding ceremonial units and music. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management

                HISTORY, MISSION AND ASPECTS UNIQUE TO BANDS

1.1. History.
   1.1.1. Military music in the United States armed forces is as old as the United States itself.
   Drummers and fifers marched with the Continental Marines during the American
   Revolutionary War. In more recent history, the armed forces have reorganized the structure
   of the musical units to reflect the nature of their unique talents and abilities. Air Force bands
   have the flexibility to fulfill many types of ceremonial missions through a variety of different
   performing ensembles.
1.2. Mission.
   1.2.1. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 35-110, Air Force Bands, covers the mission,
   organization, locations, areas of responsibility, and composition of active duty Air Force and
   Air National Guard bands. Reference Chapter 6 of that AFI for band support request
   procedures.
   1.2.2. Prioritized Federal Government and Military Customers list. Air Force bands use the
   following list (Table 1.1.) in order to determine the State Department and Department of
   Defense’s official order of precedent in ceremonies.

             Combatant Commanders/ Retired Combatant Commanders. At Multi- or Joint service
             events ONLY, order is by date of appointment. For commanders who previously held a
             confirmed position (i.e. CJCS, VCJCS, Service Chief, or Combatant Commander), use
2
             the initial date of appointment to that position. At Air Force exclusive events, Air
             Force Combatant Commanders are ranked by date of rank with other Air Force Four-
             Stars.

             For non-statutory positions within a group, precedence is by date assigned to the

             Precedence for Defense Agency Directors and Principal Deputy Directors is determined
             by the establishment date of the organization. NSA/CSS: 1952; DARPA: 1958, DISA:

           Code 4 precedence applies only to currently serving Senior Enlisted Advisors and
           Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Certain protocol
7          functions may require a deviation from the established precedence. Retired service
           senior enlisted advisors should be placed in front of other retired members of the grade
           (E-9).
           Precedence for members of the SES and the Defense Intelligence Senior Executive
           Service (DISES) is established by the position held. The SES includes various
           executive and managerial positions classified above the GS-15 of the General Schedule,
           in level IV or V of the Executive Schedule, or an equivalent position and which do not
           require appointment by the President with Senate confirmation. The SES excludes non-
8          managerial positions above grade GS-15 in the Senior Level (SL) and Scientific and
           Professional (ST) positions as well as Defense Intelligence Senior Level Professional
           positions. For those members of the SES/DISES within the OSD components, Defense
           Agencies and Field Activities whose positions are not specifically identified, their
           positions are in Code 6 under "Other members of the Senior Executive Service." It is
           recognized that within the Military Departments and on the Joint Staff, there are
           members of the SES whose position may be comparable to General/Flag Officers of the
           two- and three-star rank. In the Air Force, the following general guidance pertains to
           members of the SES whose positions are not specifically listed in this DOD Order of
           Precedence list; their precedence will be in either Code 5 or 6 but not lower than in 6.
           The determining factor will be the Code for the official to whom the SES is subordinate
           to in the organization (i.e. a Code 4, 5, or 6) or if the SES is in a position that is
           equivalent to someone whose position is listed as being in Code 5 or 6. Equivalency
           pertains to positions in Codes 5 and 6 only. To verify status or to determine if the SES
           is a Code 5 or 6, contact the member's office or the service office responsible for SES
           matters. The Air Force Senior Executive Management Office phone number is DSN
           225-5260.
           For Service-related functions and activities, when appropriate to do so, the Services
9
           may adjust the established order of precedence as necessary.
           Precedence for Directors and the Principal Deputy Directors of the Defense Field
           Activities are determined by the establishment date of the organization. The Defense
           Field Activities are listed as follows: Washington Headquarters Services (WHS): 1977,
           Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA): 1978, DoD Education Activity (DoDEA):
10         1992, Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO): 1993, DoD Human
           Resource Activity (HRA): 1996, TRICARE Management Activity: 1998, Defense
           Technical Security Administration (DTSA): 2001, DoD Counterintelligence Field
           Activity: 2002, DoD Test Resources Management Center (TRMC): 2002, Defense
           Technical Information Center (DTIC): 2004.

                 Except as noted herein, the provisions of this manual are not applicable to former
                 civilian officials of the Department as they do not retain the precedence associated with
                 their position upon departure from that position. In recognition of their past service in
11               the Department, courtesies and recognition may be extended to them as appropriate.
                 Precedence is retained, however, by former Secretaries of Defense due to their status as
                 a presidential cabinet member, and by retired members of the military since they retain
                 the rank in which they were retired.
                 Air Force Administrative Assistant, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, CMSAF. SAF/AA,
                 AF/CVA, and CMSAF are accorded special status. The SAF/AA and CVA have
12
                 precedence over all other Lieutenant Generals. In addition, the CMSAF comes
                 immediately after the AF/CVA.
                 Former and Retired: Officials are normally placed with but after actively serving
                 officials of the same position, unless their precedence is separately listed on the
                 Precedence List. For example, Presidents of the United States and Retired Chief
                 Justices of the Supreme Court are listed separately. The accepted way to rank several of
                 these former officials is by most recent service. This means each official is placed
13
                 ahead of his of her predecessor. There may be reason to do it in precise order with the
                 "oldest" outranking the "youngest", but bands normally follow the norm set by the State
                 Department for handling Former Presidents. DOD Regulation 4515.13R, para. 2-4W,
                 defines "retired military" as holding a DD Form 2 (blue or gray) and eligible for retired
                 or retainer pay.
                 State and Local: Officials are difficult to rank. Suggest contacting the State Governor's
                 office and local Mayor's office for precedence within your respective area. Generally
14
                 speaking, elected positions precede appointed positions, which in turn precede state
                 employees.
                 Sources for the Precedence List. This precedence list is based on the State Department
15               Precedence list dated Dec 2005 and the Department of Defense Table of Precedence
                 dated 14 Nov 05. Precedence Lists are inherently "unofficial" and subject to change.
                 Under Secretaries of the Executive Departments are placed above the Service
16               Secretaries. In the DoD, Under Secretaries of Defense are placed after the Chairman of
                 the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
1.3. Aspects Unique to Bands.
     1.3.1. Cancellations and Modifications. Cancellations and modifications may occur in
     situations when a higher priority customer requests support or when resources do not permit.
     They may also occur due to inclement weather. Hosts and sponsors of events must be
     notified immediately when changes are anticipated.
     1.3.2. Environmental Factors. Cancellations or modifications due to weather must be made
     no later than one hour prior to a scheduled event. Avoid subjecting guests and personnel to
     adverse weather and unsafe conditions. Extreme temperatures and atmospheric conditions
     such as lightning, tornadoes, snow, ice, and hail create hazards that endanger the safety and
     health of personnel and resources. The drum major and officer or non-commissioned officer
     in charge (OIC or NCOIC) will consider cancellation of any event when wind chill or heat
     index factors exceed medical safety guidelines (discuss with the installation medical unit for
     specific information). Weather conditions may also warrant modification to or cancellation
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                    23


  of events by the band staff. Alterations may include changing uniform combinations,
  reducing the number of troops exposed to the elements, or shortening or deleting certain
  aspects of the ceremony. Modifications should be discussed and coordinated with the host or
  sponsor prior to the event when at all possible. All reasonable customer requests will be
  honored if resources allow. When on-site calls are necessary, the ranking person in charge of
  the event in coordination with all affected units will use good judgment to ensure the
  protection of personnel and equipment as conditions dictate. The OIC or NCOIC has the
  responsibility and authority to employ the full range of protective options available.
  1.3.3. Cold weather conditions. Cold temperatures can cause malfunction and damage to
  instruments. When the temperature is 32 degrees Fahrenheit or below (factoring in wind
  chill), the band will provide an appropriate musical ensemble (percussion and/or bugler) to
  render musical honors for outdoor ceremonies. Long-term exposure to environmental
  extremes has been shown to have detrimental long-term physical effects. Below 40 degrees
  Fahrenheit, loss of sensation in extremities is caused by vascular constriction, which can lead
  to muscular damage when coupled with performance stress.
  1.3.4. Hot weather conditions. Above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, onset of heat related illnesses
  can quickly incapacitate a performer. This can be aggravated by additional concerns such as
  air quality and relative humidity. All due consideration must be given to weighing the needs
  of the customer and mission demands versus protecting manning resources.

      the overcoat per the local commander’s discretion.
   2.1.11. Black Scarf. The black scarf is an optional item worn with the ceremonial overcoat.
   Fold the scarf in half lengthwise so that the long edges are flush. Drape the scarf around the
   back of the neck so that the closed edge of the scarf is on top towards the hairline on the back
   of the neck. Fold the left side of the scarf over the right side. It should be pulled tightly so
   that the scarf is smooth and without wrinkles or bunching. To keep it taut, attach a shirt

   garter to one end of the scarf, string it behind the back and then attach it to the other end of
   the scarf.
   2.1.12. Black Gloves. These are optional items for cold weather use with all-weather coats
   and ceremonial overcoats.
   2.1.13. White Gloves. These are optional items for year-round use.
   2.1.14. Lightweight Blue Jacket. The lightweight blue jacket is authorized to be worn with
   the ceremonial uniform in place of the ceremonial tunic during transit to performance sites or
   for rehearsals and/or sound checks at a performance site. When worn with the black t-shirt,
   the lightweight blue jacket should be completely zipped up. Enlisted chevrons should be
   sewn on IAW 36-2903. Embroidery of the AF Logo IAW 36-2903 is required.
2.2. Optional Uniform Items.
   2.2.1. Thermal Underwear. Thermal underwear is an optional item.             If worn with the
   ceremonial uniform, thermal underwear must be black.
   2.2.2. Black Cloth Ear Protectors. Black cloth ear protectors, which are not ear muffs, wrap
   around the back of the head are a valid replacement for a cold weather cap with the local
   commander’s consent. When used, black cloth ear protectors must be worn in conjunction
   with the ceremonial blue service cap.
   2.2.3. Cold Weather Cap. The cold weather cap is an optional uniform item. This item is
   worn with chrome career field insignia (enlisted) or USAF insignia (officers).
   2.2.4. Ceremonial Skirt (Figure 2.11.). The Ceremonial Skirt is an optional uniform item.
   Modified Service Dress skirt will be 100% polyester twill, Air Force shade 1625, fully lined
   garment and hang naturally over the hips with a slight flare. The skirt will be no shorter than
   the top of the kneecap and no longer than the bottom of the kneecap when standing at
   attention. The skirt will be straight style with belt loops, a kick pleat in the back and no
   pockets or darts on the skirt. Skirts will have a back zipper and lining attached to the waist.
   May be worn with short sleeve or long sleeve Ceremonial shirt only and flat black patent
   leather shoes not to exceed 1 ½ inches in height.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                  31

2.3. Conventions Regarding Ceremonial Uniform Wear.
   2.3.1. The flight cap is authorized at the local commander’s discretion to be worn with the
   ceremonial uniform during transit to and from performance sites.
   2.3.2. The Ceremonial Overcoat is authorized at the local commander’s discretion to be
   worn over the Ceremonial Tunic during transit to and from performance sites.
   2.3.3. Glasses worn with the ceremonial uniform will be USAF-issue silver aviator style
   frames or conservative frames approved by the local commander to ensure a uniform
   appearance.
   2.3.4. Sunglasses and photosensitive lenses may be worn during outdoor ceremonies and
   non-ceremonial concerts at the local commander’s discretion. All sunglasses must be
   exclusively USAF-issue silver aviator style frames to ensure a uniform appearance. When
   worn in formation, all personnel must have this item. For outdoor ceremonial missions not
   performed standing in formation, wear policy of sunglasses is at the local commander’s
   discretion.
2.4. Ceremonial Uniform Appearance Standards.
   2.4.1. The ceremonial uniform is a performance uniform and should be worn only in transit
   to and from performance sites, unless circumstances dictate otherwise. When worn in transit,
   a flight cap is authorized to be worn in place of the ceremonial blue service cap. The
   ceremonial uniform is not for use as duty uniform for daily rehearsal or office work, unless
   time restraints preclude a uniform change.
   2.4.2. The ceremonial uniform is the prescribed band uniform for most military ceremonies.
   A utility uniform may be substituted for use in ceremonies as directed by the local
   commander.
   2.4.3. Outstanding appearance is essential to the success of all ceremonies. Bands must
   present the highest professional military image at all times.

  2.4.4. Uniforms should be steamed, ironed, or professionally cleaned prior to each
  performance. When ironing, to avoid creating shiny surfaces on the uniform (scorching), use
  a cover sheet or other smooth cloth between the iron and the garment.
  2.4.5. Avoid wrinkling the uniform as much as possible prior to a performance. Rather than
  wearing the ceremonial tunic while seated, hang the blouse and outerwear on hangers when
  possible. Otherwise, fold the tunic and outerwear neatly over a seat back (or flat in the
  overhead compartments of a bus), inside out as to prevent lint accumulation. When seated,
  avoid crossing your legs. Store ceremonial uniforms carefully using a shaped hangar for the
  tunic or all-weather coat. Use pants hangers for the ceremonial trousers.
  2.4.6. The visor of the ceremonial cap should be clean and polished. Never set the cap down
  on its top. When cap cover is worn, it must have a taut appearance on top of the ceremonial
  cap. The career field hat insignia should be covered completely by the cap cover.
  2.4.7. Insignia pin fastening clasps wear over time and may possibly detach. As an
  emergency remedy, scratch the pin spike with pliers or other sharp object to help the clasp
  remain.
  2.4.8. Many pictures in this manual are taken without white gloves for clarity of hand
  positions, although wear of white gloves is optimal for all performances.

                                 MANUAL OF MARCHING

3.1. Training Responsibilities. Each band assigns a ceremonial training NCO who is
responsible to train all band members in ceremonial protocol, procedures, and techniques. The
ceremonial training NCO is generally the band’s drum major or another member with extensive
experience in performing military ceremonies.
   3.1.1. The ceremonial training NCO instructs all new members in the proper wear and
   maintenance of the ceremonial uniform, standards of appearance, and basic ceremonial
   protocol, procedures, and techniques. These include playing and non-playing positions,
   facing movements, proper marching technique and style, and proper ceremonial sequences.
   3.1.2. The ceremonial training NCO or Drum Major instructs individuals in the proper
   execution of mace commands and explains commands for executing various turns and
   countermarches. For more information, see Chapter 7.
   3.1.3. After completion of training sessions with the ceremonial training NCO and Drum
   Major, members must perform in a ceremony to demonstrate mastery of ceremonial
   procedures.
3.2. Basic Stationary Movements.
   3.2.1. Attention. (Reference term in Attachment 1.). The command is “Tench HUT”.
   Members should maintain proper military bearing at all times but should not be excessively
   stiff or rigid that will impede musicality and proper instrumental technique. All body parts
   should be stacked upon one another creating an even line from the feet to the head.
       3.2.1.1. Head. The head is level with the ground with line of sight being straight out
       from the body and parallel to the ground. The eyes should look directly forward.
       3.2.1.2. Shoulders. The shoulders are squared with the body, parallel with the ground,
       perpendicular with line of sight, and even. Shoulders should be down, relaxed, and rolled
       slightly back to open the chest area.
       3.2.1.3. Arms. The arm that is not holding an instrument hangs straight down alongside
       the body. The wrist is not bent. Place the thumb, which is resting along the joint of the
       forefinger, along the seam of the trousers. The hand is cupped, but not clenched in a fist,
       with the palm facing the leg (Figure 3.1.). This is the same position of “Attention” as
       described in AFMAN 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies. Arm position differs with each
       particular instrument. The instrument-specific carriage positions are covered in Chapter
       4.

Figure 3.1. Hands at Position of Attention.




       3.2.1.4. Back. The back should be perpendicular with the ground, straight but not stiff.
       The back should not be bent or bowed. Posture should present a professional appearance
       without hindering proper breathing or instrumental technique.
       3.2.1.5. Hips. Hips are squared with the body. Do not tuck the hips back or thrust the
       hips forward.
       3.2.1.6. Feet. Heels are together and toes apart to create a 30-degree angle with the feet
       (Figure 3.2.).

Figure 3.2. Feet at Attention.




   3.2.2. Parade Rest. The command is “Parade REST”. This command is given from the
   position of Attention. At the position of Parade Rest, the feet will be shoulder width apart
   (Figure 3.3.). This distance is relative to the physical size of each band member; fixed foot
   distances can cause an unnatural appearance. The feet are still turned out, open at 30
   degrees, a 15-degree turnout with each foot, as with the position of Attention, but with an
   approximately 12-inch distance between the heels.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                     35


Figure 3.3. Feet at Parade Rest.




   3.2.3. Facing Movements. A facing movement is a simple drill move that causes the band to
   face a different direction when stationary.
       3.2.3.1. Left Face. The command is “Left FACE”. On the command of execution,
       "FACE," the band member pivots on the heel of the left foot and the ball of the right foot
       (Figure 3.4.). The body turns to face 90 degrees to the left, maintaining the position of
       Attention from the waist up. The right foot is then brought quickly in line with the left
       foot, with heels together and toes apart to create a 30-degree angle. The band member is
       now at the position of Attention facing left.

Figure 3.4. Feet in Left Face.




       3.2.3.2. Right Face. The command is “Right FACE”. On the command of execution,
       "FACE," the band member pivots on the heel of the right foot and the ball of the left
       foot. The body turns to face 90 degrees to the right, maintaining the position of Attention
       from the waist up (reverse of Figure 3.4.). The left foot is then brought quickly in line
       with the right foot. The band member is now at the position of Attention facing right.
       3.2.3.3. About Face. The command is “About FACE”. On the command of execution,
       "FACE," the band member places the toe of the right foot behind and slightly to the left
       of the left heel (Figure 3.5.). The band member then pivots to the right while pivoting on
       the right toe and left heel. The body's vertical alignment should not be altered during the
       turn (rotation). The feet will end in the position of Attention. The band member is now
       at the position of Attention facing the rear.

Figure 3.5. Feet in About Face.




   3.2.4. Dress. Dress describes the side-by-side alignment of members within a rank. Each
   member must be positioned so that the shoulders are parallel with the rank and perpendicular
   with the file. The far left (or far right) file has no dress responsibility, depending on which
   way the band is dressing. Therefore the far left (or far right) does not execute a head turn
   since they are the file members to which all others dress.
      3.2.4.1. Dress Center. The command is “Dress Center DRESS”. On the command of
      execution, the second "DRESS," the center file does not move; they remain at the
      position of Attention. They are the file members to which all other files dress. Members
      to the right of the center file turn their heads quickly to the left (to the center). Members
      to the left of the center file turn their heads quickly to the right (to the center). Turn the
      head at a 45-degree angle, using peripheral vision to determine dress and alignment. The
      body's alignment or position does not change; only the head changes. The Drum Major
      aligns the band by looking down each rank, adjusting each rank as necessary, using
      verbal directions to members in positions as numbered by file; “Second person
      forward…third person forward, fourth person back.” The Drum Major then returns to the
      front of the formation. Once the band is dressed, the Drum Major brings the band back to
      the position of Attention with the command “Ready FRONT”. On the command of
      execution, “FRONT”, band members whose heads are turned move their heads quickly
      back to the front. The band is now dressed and at the position of Attention. If there are
      an even numbers of files, the Drum Major will identify a guide file.
      3.2.4.2. Dress Left. The command is “Dress Left DRESS”. On the command of
      execution, the second “DRESS”, the leftmost file remains stationary at the position of
      Attention. They are the file members to which all other files dress. Members to the right
      of the left most file turn their heads quickly to the left (Figure 3.6.). Turn the head at a
      45-degree angle, using peripheral vision to determine dress and alignment. Do not
      change the body's alignment or position; move only the head. The drum major will align
      the band from left by looking down each rank, adjusting each rank as necessary, using
      verbal directions to members in positions as numbered by file; “Second person
      forward…third person forward, fourth person back.” The Drum Major then returns to the
      front of the formation. Once the band is dressed, the drum major brings the band back to
      the position of Attention with the command “Ready FRONT”. On the command of
      execution, “FRONT”, the band members whose heads are turned will turn their heads
      quickly back to the front. The band is now dressed and back at the position of Attention.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                       37


Figure 3.6. Dress Left.




       3.2.4.3. Dress Right. The command is “Dress Right DRESS”. On the command of
       execution, the second “DRESS”, the rightmost file does not move; they remain at the
       position of Attention. This is the file to which all other files dress. Members to the left
       of the rightmost file turn their heads quickly to the right (Figure 3.7.). Turn the head at a
       45-degree angle, using peripheral vision to determine dress and alignment. Do not
       change the body's alignment or position; move only the head. The Drum Major aligns
       the band from the right by looking down each rank, adjusting each rank as necessary,
       using verbal directions to members in positions as numbered by file; “Second person
       forward…third person forward, fourth person back.” The Drum Major then returns to the
       front of the formation. Once the band is dressed, the drum major brings the band back to
       the position of Attention with the command “Ready FRONT”. On the command of
       execution, “FRONT”, the band members whose heads are turned move their heads
       smartly back to the front. The band is now dressed and back at the position of Attention.

Figure 3.7. Dress Right.




   3.2.5. Cover. Cover describes the front-to-back alignment of members in file or column.
   The command is “COVER”. This can also be used after the command for “Dress
   Center/Right/Left”. The forward most rank has no cover responsibility. When band
 38                                                          AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


   members “cover” on the person in front of them, they should not be able to see the head of
   the second person in front of them.
3.3. Band-Specific Stationary Movements.
   3.3.1. Changing Music. When the band officer or the drum major announces a piece, band
   members should change music with a minimum of motion. This is normally done at Parade
   Rest. If this is not possible, music may be changed with instruments up. In these cases, the
   band officer or Drum Major should allow enough time for band members to change music
   before the downbeat.
   3.3.2. Horns Down. There is no vocal command given for Horns Down (reference Chapters
   7 and 8). The instrument is placed in the carry position as the band officer’s or drum major's
   arm is lowered. On the march, the band places the instruments in the carry position
   immediately after the music is finished as the cadence resumes. Each instrument moves
   differently (reference Chapter 4).
   3.3.3. Horns Up. There is no vocal command for Horns Up. The drum major gives a
   preparatory arm signal with his or her hand pointing up (reference Chapters 7 and 8). At this
   point, the band prepares to bring its instruments to the playing position. The Drum Major's
   arm then comes down to a position parallel to the ground, allowing the band to get ready.
   The drum major rearticulates the down position and then raises the hand back to the up
   position (perpendicular to the ground). When the Drum Major's arm comes back up,
   instruments also come up to the playing position. On the march, instruments come up via a
   mace command on the roll of a Roll-Off. The Horns Up motion for band officers is similar
   to the motion for Drum Majors with the exception that the band officer’s arms mirror each
   other due to the lack of a mace (reference Chapter 8). Each instrument moves differently
   during Horns Up (reference Chapter 4).
   3.3.4. Three-Count About Face. There is no command for this movement. This movement is
   only performed while moving as a solitary member and from the position of Attention
   (Figure 3.8.). Lift the left foot just enough to clear the ground and place it in front
   (perpendicular) of the right foot forming a "T" with both feet, bending the knees slightly
   (Figure 3.9.). This is the first count of the movement. In the second count, the position of the
   left foot is not changed; lift the right foot just high enough to clear the ground and pivot 180
   degrees, bring the heels together to form a 90-degree angle (an "L") (Figure 3.10.), then bring
   the left foot smartly to the right foot (third count), resuming the position of attention (Figure
   3.11.). Keep the arms pinned at the side for the entire movement. Head and eyes follow the
   lead/moving foot on each count.

Figure 3.11. Resumed Position of Attention.




3.4. Basic Marching Movements.
   3.4.1. Arm Swing. The arm not involved in holding an instrument swings with the opposite
   foot. If the left arm is free, it swings six inches to the front when the left foot is behind and
   three inches to the rear when the left foot is forward. If the right arm is free, it swings six
   inches to the front when the right foot is behind and three inches to the rear when the right
   foot is forward. The arm should be relaxed and not stiff. A natural swing will result in a
   slight break in the elbow on the forward swing. The arm swing should maintain a plane
   parallel with line of sight and direction of travel (Figures 3.12. and 3.13.). Arm swings are
   suspended on the point of flank in any marching maneuver and on all Half Steps and Mark
   Time.

Figure 3.12. Arm Swing Front.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                       41


Figure 3.13. Arm Swing Rear.




   3.4.2. Mark Time March. The command is “Mark Time MARCH”. This command may be
   given from Forward March or Halt. From a Halt, the first two counts of the mark time
   motion should bring the toes into a position pointing in the direction of travel with toes and
   heels being directly adjacent to one another. The left foot is lifted first with the heel of the
   left foot reaching parallel to the center of the ankle bone of the right leg and the toes staying
   as close to the ground as possible (Figure 3.14.). From a Forward MARCH, or after the first
   two counts of mark time from a Halt, the toes should remain on the ground with the heel
   striking the ground comfortably and without shock at each cadence pulse. The knee will
   break naturally and extend beyond the plane of the opposite leg (Figure 3.15.) The upper
   body maintains the position of Attention. The knee bend and heel height should be
   consistent for all counts of the mark time. Members should not lean toward the lifted foot to
   maintain balance. The upper body should remain steady at the position of Attention during
   Mark Time March. Dig into the ground with each big toe to prevent leaning if necessary.
   Each foot should remain pointed straight forward without turning out when on the ground
   during Mark Time March (Figure 3.16.). At the command of Halt, the feet resume their 30-
   degree angle in the position of Attention.

Figure 3.15. Knee bend in Mark Time.




Figure 3.16. Toe position in Mark Time.




   3.4.3. Halt. The command is “HALT”. This command may be given from Mark Time
   March or Forward March. On the first count after the command of execution "HALT," the
   right foot stops at a 15-degree angle to the perpendicular plane of the shoulders, turned out to
   the right (Figure 3.17.). On the second count after the command of execution, the left foot
   stops with the heels touching and the toes apart at 30 degrees. This places the band member
   in the position of Attention.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                      43


Figure 3.17. Feet at Attention.




   3.4.4. Forward March. The command is “Forward MARCH”. This command can be given
   from Mark Time March or Halt. If given from Mark Time March, it is called on the last step
   of the Mark Time March, the count before the step off. The right foot lands on the ground
   with the toe facing forward. This plant of the right foot gives the band member a solid
   footing from which to take the first full-sized step. If given from a Halt, the left knee breaks
   forward from the plane of the body and the left heel lifts. The foot then moves forward 24
   inches from where it began. The left foot steps first with the heel hitting on the cadence
   pulse, and the foot rolling through to the toe. The rear foot, as the heel rises up through the
   roll step, will provide the pressure to continue forward motion. The step size is 24 inches,
   from heel to heel, or toe to toe. Band members must take care that the first and last steps are
   24 inches. As the lower body provides forward motion and the upper body maintains the
   position of Attention, the weight of the body should be centered between the feet on each
   step. The toes are pointed straight toward the front with no outward turn. Roll through the
   middle of the foot, not the outside. The feet should move side-by-side like a cross-country
   skier, not placed one in front of the other like a tightrope walker (Figure 3.18.). There should
   be as little upper body movement as possible for stability while playing an instrument. Heels
   should not be lifted more than an inch off the ground on each step; this is called "bicycling,"
   and can reduce step size and posture. Keep the feet close to the ground with as little vertical
   motion as possible.

Figure 3.18. Feet in Forward March.

   3.4.5. Step Size. The step size used by the Air Force band career field is a 24-inch step
   (Figure 3.19.). Step size is also called pace. Intervals may be adjusted to 30-inch step sizes
   between players to accommodate the spatial needs of the various instruments; however the
   standard pace of travel should remain 24-inch steps. At times, the step size may be adjusted
   to accommodate a variety of situations. On a wheel turn, for instance, the interior files dress
   to the outside of the formation. The exterior files maintain a 24-inch step, and the interior
   files must take a smaller than normal step size. This step, whatever its length, is called an
   adjusted step size.

Figure 3.19. Step Size in Forward March.




3.5. Marching Maneuvers.
   3.5.1. Turns. A turn is a drill sequence used to move the band in a new direction. For drill
   sequences used to face the band 180 degrees the opposite direction, see Countermarch,
   paragraph 3.5.3. Each type of turn involves a mace command (see Chapter 7).
      3.5.1.1. Square Turns. Each file performs a flanking movement with each member of the
      file performing a flank two steps after the person in front of them.
          3.5.1.1.1. Left Square Turn, General. The vocal command for a Square Turn is “Left
          Turn MARCH”. On a Left Square Turn, the left file performs a flank on the first
          count after the mace command of execution with each member flanking two counts
          after the person in front of them. The point at which the first person in the file flanks
          becomes the point at which each person in that file performs a flank. The second file
          flanks two counts after the first file from the left. Again, each member performs a
          flank two counts after the person in front on them. Each successive file flanks two
          counts after the file to their left. The Drum Major gives a Mark Time March
          command to the left file, allowing the other files to catch up. Finally, the drum major
          then gives a Halt or Forward March, depending on the circumstance. The dress
          during the Mark Time March is in the direction of the first file to flank. On a Left
          Square Turn, the dress on the Mark Time March is to the left (see Figure 3.20.).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                     45

          3.5.1.1.2. Left Square Turn, Specific Roles.
             3.5.1.1.2.1. Drum Major. Shift the mace to a right carry. Raise left arm and look
             to the left. When the corner person in the left file reaches the place to turn, lower
             left arm to the side. Take one step, and flank left. Take two steps for each rank in
             the band plus two steps for each file in the band. (Twenty-four steps are required
             for a band with seven ranks and five files.) After marching the required steps,
             mark time march. Turn to face the band. When all band members have turned
             and aligned themselves, signal a Forward March with the mace and a vocal
             command, and take two steps to the rear, away from the band. Turn back to the
             front as you move and continue with a 24-inch step size.
             3.5.1.1.2.2. Left File. If the band member is the first person in the left file, take
             the following actions when the Drum Major's left arm drops. Take one step and
             flank left. March forward two steps for each rank in the band, then mark time
             march. When the Drum Major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch
             step. If the band member is not the first person in the file, flank left two steps
             after the person in front. Turn where the first file member turns. March forward
             two steps for each rank in the band minus two steps for each rank in front. (For
             example, if the band member is in the third rank of a band with seven ranks,
             march forward ten steps [14 minus 4].) Then Mark Time March or half step. If
             the person in front marks time before the allotted time, Mark Time March. When
             the Drum Major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch step. All
             personnel suspend arm swing at the point of the turn and half step.
             3.5.1.1.2.3. Other Files. If the band member is the first person in the file take the
             following actions: flank left two steps after the person to the left turns. March
             forward until aligned with the correct rank (the same person to the left), then mark
             time march. When the Drum Major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-

             inch step. If not the first person in the file, turn left two steps after the person in
             front turns. Flank left where the first file member turned. March forward until
             aligned with the same person to the left), then mark time march or half step.
             When the Drum Major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch step. All
             personnel suspend arm swing on point of flank and half step.
             3.5.1.1.2.4. Band Officer. Flank left two steps after the person to the left turns.
             March forward until aligned with the first rank, then Mark Time March. When
             the drum major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch step.
         3.5.1.1.3. Right Square Turn, General. A Right Square Turn is performed in the
         same manner as a Left Square Turn, except that the command is given on the right
         foot and the flanks are to the right. The vocal command for a Right Square Turn is
         “Right Turn MARCH”. On a Right Square Turn, the right file performs a flank on
         the first count after the mace command of execution with each member flanking two
         counts after the person in front of them. The point at which the first person in the file
         flanks becomes the point at which each person in that file performs a flank. The
         second file flanks two counts after the first file from the right. Again, each member
         performs a flank two counts after the person in front of them. Each successive file
         flanks two counts after the file to their right. The Drum Major then gives a Mark
         Time March to the right file, allowing the other files to catch up. Finally, the drum
         major then gives a Halt or Forward March, depending on the circumstance. The dress
         during the Mark Time March is in the direction of the first file to flank. On a Right
         Square Turn, the dress on the Mark Time March is to the right (see Figure 3.21.). All
         personnel suspend arm swing at the point of flank and Half Step.

         3.5.1.1.4. Right Turn, Specific Roles.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                        47


            3.5.1.1.4.1. Drum Major. Raise right arm and look to the right. When the corner
            person in the right file reaches the place to turn, lower right arm to the side. Take
            one step and flank right. Take two steps for each rank in the band plus two steps
            for each file in the band. (Twenty-four steps are required for a band with seven
            ranks and five files. Take 14 steps for the seven ranks and ten steps for the files.)
            After marching the required steps, Mark Time March. Turn to face the band.
            When all band members have turned and aligned themselves, signal a Forward
            March with the mace and a voice command and take two steps to the rear, away
            from the band. Turn back to the front, and continue with a 24-inch step size.
            3.5.1.1.4.2. Right File. As the first person in the right file, take the following
            actions when the Drum Major's right arm drops. Take one step and flank right.
            March forward two steps for each rank in the band, then mark time march. When
            the drum major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch step. If not the
            first person in the file, flank right two steps after the person in front. Turn where
            the first file member turned. March forward two steps for each rank in the band
            minus two steps for each rank in front. (If in the fifth rank of a band with seven
            ranks, march forward six steps [14 minus 8].). Mark time march. When the drum
            major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch step.
            3.5.1.1.4.3. Other Files. If the first person in the file, take the following actions.
            Flank right two steps after the person to the right has turned. March forward until
            aligned with the same person to the right), then mark time march. When the
            Drum Major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch step. If not the first
            person in the file, flank right two steps after the person in front. March forward
            until aligned with the same person to the right), then Mark Time March. When
            the drum major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch step.
            3.5.1.1.4.4. Band Officer. When the drum major's right arm drops, take two steps
            backward and flank right. (Pivot on the right foot.) March forward two steps for
            each rank in the band minus two steps, then mark time march. When the Drum
            Major signals Forward March, step off at a full 24-inch step.
     3.5.1.2. Column Turns. A Column Turn is a turn in which the files of the band perform a
     flank (square turn) for the interior file and two oblique turns for all other files to change
     direction to the right or left while marching.
        3.5.1.2.1. Column Turn to the Right. The command is “Column Right MARCH”.
        On the second count following the command of execution, "MARCH," the front
        most band member in the right file performs a right flank. Upon completion of right
        flank, the element leader will take one 24-inch step followed immediately by a half-
        step march. Each member in that file performs a right flank two steps after the person
        in front of them. The first person in the second file from the right performs a right
        oblique turn. After two steps, the first person in the second file from the right
        performs another right oblique turn so that they are facing 90 degrees to the right of
        the plane of the previous direction. Each subsequent file add two steps after the first
        oblique turn, i.e. the third file marches four steps after the first oblique, the fourth file
        marches six steps after the first oblique and so on. Upon completion of the last
        oblique turn, all element leaders will take 24-inch steps until in alignment with the
 48                                                           AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


          right file, followed immediately by a half-step march. After each file has come to a
          90 degree new direction, the Drum Major will give either a Mark Time March or
          Forward March (see Figure 3.22.). Please note that in Figure 3.22., the officer is the
          person in the right file, and therefore is the member that performs the right flank.

Figure 3.22. Column Turn to the Right.




          3.5.1.2.2. Column Turn to the Left. The command is “Column Left MARCH”. On
          the second count following the command of execution, "MARCH," the front most
          band member in the left file performs a left flank. Upon completion of left flank, the
          element leader will take one 24-inch step followed immediately by a half-step march.
          Each member in that file performs a left flank two steps after the person in front of
          them. The first person in the second file from the left performs a left oblique turn.
          After two steps, the first person in the second file from the left performs another left
          oblique turn so that they are facing 90 degrees to the left of the plane of the previous
          direction. Each subsequent file add two steps after the first oblique; i.e., the third file
          marches four steps after the first oblique, the fourth file marches six steps after the
          first oblique and so on. Upon completion of last oblique turn, all element leaders will
          take 24-inch steps until in alignment with left file followed immediately by a half-
          step march. After each file has come to a 90 degree new direction, the Drum Major
          will give either a Mark Time March or Forward March (see Figure 3.23.).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                  49


Figure 3.23. Column Turn to the Left.




      3.5.1.3. Wheel Turn. There is no vocal command for a Wheel Turn, although the Drum
      Major may tell the band to “GUIDE AROUND”. With a mace, the Drum Major first
      faces the band and raises the mace to eye level. The drum major then turns the mace
      either to the right or the left, depending on which way the band will turn. The band
      follows the path of the drum major as indicated by the mace. Each band member’s path
      will create an arc that is a quarter circle. The band members on the interior of the turn
      must adjust their step size to a smaller step size to accommodate the larger arc being
      formed by the band members on the outside columns. The exterior members should
      maintain a 24-inch step. The step size of each interior file will progressively decrease
      from the exterior file's 24-inch step. The dress on a Wheel Turn is to the outside of the
      turn. The Drum Major will give a Forward March, allowing the interior band members
      that are taking adjusted-size steps to resume a 24-inch step (see Figure 3.24.).
 50                                                          AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


Figure 3.24. Wheel Turn.




   3.5.2. Column of Files. This is a means of moving the band easily without marching in
   standard formation. Column of Files can be done as a route step (walking forward without
   regards to tempo) or in cadence.
      3.5.2.1. From the Right. The command is “Column of Files From the Right, Forward
      MARCH”. If the Drum Major designates a drum tap, stick tap, or drum cadence, the file
      furthest to the right will march forward. If tempo is not specified by the drum major, the
      file will proceed without regards to tempo, using what is called a route step. As the right
      file passes the next most right file, the front most band member in the next most right file
      gives the command “Forward MARCH”over their right shoulder. The second file from
      the right then follows the first file. Each file consecutively from the right then follows
      the preceding file in order. When the front person in the furthest right file arrives at the
      destination, as signaled by the Drum Major, the person stops (or marks time if moving to
      tap or cadence). Each band member stops in formation behind the front person. The
      second file proceeds to the left of the first file to take their place in formation, as it was
      when they stepped off (see Figure 3.25.).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                       51


Figure 3.25. Column of Files From the Right.




      3.5.2.2. From the Left. The command is “Column of Files From the Left, Forward
      MARCH”. If the drum major designates a drum tap, stick tap, or drum cadence, the file
      furthest to the left will march forward. If tempo is not specified by the drum major, the
      file will proceed without regards to tempo, using what is called a route step. As the left
      file passes the next most right file, the front-most band member in the next most right file
      gives the command “Forward MARCH”. The second file from the left then follows the
      first file. Each file consecutively from the left then follows the preceding file in order.
      When the front person in the furthest left file arrives at the destination the person stops
      (or marks time if moving to tap or cadence). Each band member stops in formation
      behind the front person. The second file proceeds to the right of the first file to take their
      place in formation, as it was when they stepped off (see Figure 3.26.).

   3.5.3. Countermarch. A countermarch is a drill that positions the band facing the opposite
   direction.
      3.5.3.1. Wheel (Non-Reversible) Countermarch, General. There is no vocal command
      for this drill. The Drum Major will face the band and march through its center. The
      mace command is as follows: The mace is held horizontal above eye level, and the ball
      of the mace is brought down so the mace is now vertical with the ferrule pointing up,
      centered on the body's vertical alignment (reference Chapter 7.). This is a countermarch
      where the interior file marches in a small arc to reverse direction. The center file turns
      counter clockwise to the left. If there are an even number of files, the file right of center
      will act as the interior file and turn clockwise to the left. Each successive exterior file
      marches in an arc to the outside of the first (interior) arc. The paths created by these arcs
      produce a series of concentric arcs that are half-circles. Each file has reversed direction.
      The Drum Major then gives the command “Mark Time MARCH” to the interior file and
      each file mark time marches when it is aligned with the interior file. The person in the
      front of the center file should stay a specific number of steps behind the Drum Major, the
      number of files plus one. If there are seven files, 7+1=8 steps behind the drum major.
      The band will be in formation facing the opposite direction from which it started, and the
      left file is still on the left, which is why this move is sometimes called a Non-Reversible
      Countermarch. The files are not reversed as they are on the Box, or Reversible,
      countermarch (see Figure 3.27.).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                  53


Figure 3.27. Wheel Countermarch.




         3.5.3.1.1. Specific Roles during Wheel (Non-Reversible) Countermarch.
            3.5.3.1.1.1. Drum Major. Point the ferrule of the mace upward. Turn and face
            the band while marching. Lift the mace so it is parallel with the ground
            (horizontal) and above eye level. Give the signal of execution by moving the
            ferrule downward on the right step, moving the mace to a vertical position.
            March forward through the band. Continue marching at a full step until passing
            the last rank. Turn to face the band and march at a half step. The band will
            march at half step until the front rank is even with the first person in the rank.
            The Drum Major will adjust steps until at a proper distance from the first rank.
            When the last rank has completed the movement, signal a Forward March. Turn
            and face away from the band and continue marching.
            3.5.3.1.1.2. Guide File. When the drum major lowers the ferrule of the mace, the
            guide file will march at half step. The first person in the guide file follows the
            Drum Major by marching in a semicircle to the left. The other band members
            follow the person in front of them. All file members continue marching at half
            step. When the drum major signals Forward March, the band members step off at
            a full step.
            3.5.3.1.1.3. Files to the right of the guide file. When the Drum Major lowers the
            ferrule of the mace, the band members continue marching at a full step. The first
            person in the file marches in a semicircle to the left. The other band members in
            the file follow the person in front of you. When the file is aligned with the guide
            in the rank, the band members march at a half step. When the drum major signals
 54                                                         AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


             a Forward March, the band members step off at a full step.
             3.5.3.1.1.4. Files to the left of the guide file. When the Drum Major lowers the
             ferrule of the mace, the band members continue marching at a full step. The first
             person in the file marches in a semicircle to the right. The other band members
             follow the first person. When the file is aligned with the guide in the rank, the
             band members march at a half step. When the Drum Major signals Forward
             March, the band members step off at a full step.
             3.5.3.1.1.5. Band Officer. When the Drum Major lowers the ferrule of the mace,
             the band officer marches in a semicircle to the left, always marching to the
             outside of the left file. When aligned with the first rank, the band officer marches
             at half step. When the Drum Major signals Forward March, the band officer steps
             off at a full step.
      3.5.3.2. Box (Reversible) Countermarch, General. There is no vocal command for this
      drill, which is identified before the ceremony begins. The Drum Major faces the band,
      gives the mace command, and marches through its center. The mace command is as
      follows: the mace is held in the horizontal position and above eye level, and the ferrule
      of the mace is lowered so the mace is vertical with the ball of the mace pointing up (see
      Chapter 7). The mace is centered on the body. The mace command is given before the
      Drum Major marches through the band (see Figure 3.28.).

Figure 3.28. Box Countermarch




         3.5.3.2.1. Specific Role for the Box (Reversible) Countermarch.
             3.5.3.2.1.1. Each member of the front rank (the first member in each file)
             executes a left flank, pivoting on the right foot on the fourth count after the point
             of execution. The first step of the flank occurs on the fifth count after the mace
             command of execution. Each band member in the front rank makes a flank to the
             left for two steps, the second of which is a half step and then makes a flank to the
             left again, resuming full step size. This places the band members in a position
             facing the opposite direction from which they started. The second rank executes
             the left flank two steps after the first rank. Each rank has reversed direction. The
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                       55


             band will be in formation facing the opposite direction from which it started, but
             the left file will now be on the right, which is why it is sometimes referred to as a
             Reversible Countermarch. The person in the front of the center file should stay a
             specific number of steps behind the drum major, the number of files plus 1. If
             there are seven files, the person in front of the center file stays (7+1=8) eight steps
             behind the Drum Major. The files are now reversed (see Figure 3.28.), which is
             different from the Wheel Countermarch.
             3.5.3.2.1.2. Drum Major. Point the ferrule of the mace upward, turning to face
             the band while marching. The Drum Major brings the mace to a position parallel
             with the ground and above eye level and gives the signal of execution by moving
             the ferrule downward on the right step. March toward and through the center of
             the band. Continue marching at a full step until past the last rank. The Drum
             Major turns and faces the band while marching, adjusting steps until reaching the
             proper distance from the first rank. The Drum Major signals Forward March
             when the band has executed the countermarch. The Drum Major then turns away
             from the band and marches at a full size step.
             3.5.3.2.1.3. All other band members and the Band Officer. The band members in
             the front rank take one more step, doing two consecutive left flanks four counts
             after the Drum Major lowers the ferrule of the mace. Band members not in the
             first rank turn two steps after the person in front of them. Everyone turns where
             the first rank turns. Band members will guide on the center file of the band or, in
             a band with an even number of files, on the right center file.
  3.5.4. Close to the Center. This maneuver can only be performed while marching. There is
  no vocal command for Close to the Center. The Drum Major faces the band with the mace
  lifted horizontally above eye level, bringing both hands together on the mace to indicate that
  the band should close to the center. The center file marches at half step (15-inch step). All
  other files each perform an oblique turn towards the center file for two counts. The left most
  and right most files to the center file then perform an oblique turn back to the front after two
  oblique turns so the files are marching forward again but one step closer to the center file.
  When they oblique turn back to the front, each file changes to half steps. As the right most
  and left most files from the center perform the second oblique turn two steps after the first
  oblique turn, the next two exterior files from them perform a second oblique turn four steps
  after the first oblique turn to change direction back to the front. Each pair of exterior files
  adds two steps to the oblique turn past each interior file until all files are marching forward
  again (see Figure 3.29.).

Figure 3.29. Close to the Center.




       3.5.4.1. The band officer always performs the Close to the Center move with the front
       rank. Once the band has closed and is marching forward at half step, the Drum Major
       gives a command “Forward MARCH”, and the band steps off at a full 24-inch step.
   3.5.5. Pass In Review. A Pass In Review, or Review, is performed during retirement
   ceremonies, Tattoos, changes of command, and certain arrival ceremonies. The band
   repositions with a Right Face. The band steps off playing a march such as "Queen City,"
   completes a left square turn, passes before the official party, executes three left square turns
   and halts before the official party. Alternate Pass in Review maneuvers are discussed in
   Chapter 9.
   3.5.6. Sound Off. This maneuver allows the band to pass before the official party in the
   same manner as a Pass In Review, but the band returns to its starting position. The band will
   step off playing a march such as “Queen City”, complete a left square turn, pass before the
   official party, countermarch (usually a wheel countermarch), pass before the official party
   again, complete right square turn and countermarch and halt in their starting position (see
   Figure 3.30.).

                               MANUAL OF INSTRUMENTS

4.1. Training Responsibility. Section leaders are responsible to instruct individual members in
the instrument-specific details regarding their section’s appearance, position, and carriage.
4.2. Appearance. All instruments should have a polished and clean appearance and should be
free from major dents and scratches. Instruments should be playable and in good working order.
The finish of each group of instruments should present a consistent visual appearance. Metal
wind instruments should, if possible, have a silver finish. Wooden instruments such as clarinets
should be black in appearance, in either plastic or wood. Piccolos should be silver or, if wooden,
have a black appearance. Drums should have a silver, white, or black shell. Mouthpieces may
be gold or silver-plated, and plastic rims may be used. Ligatures must have a gold or silver
finish. Lyres must have a silver or chrome finish. Drumsticks should be finished wood or white
in color. With the exception of mouthpieces and ligatures, uniformity should exist within each
section.
4.3. General Positions.
   4.3.1. Parade Rest. Arm positions of the members are different for each individual
   instrument. See each instrument listing in this chapter for detailed information about arm
   positions at Parade Rest.
   4.3.2. Ready Position (before Attention). The command is “STAND BY”. In the Ready
   Position, the feet do not change. The arm not holding an instrument moves to the side of the
   body.
   4.3.3. Attention. The command is “Tench HUT”. Description of the basic position of
   Attention is covered in section 3.2.1. Instrument carriage in the position of Attention is
   different for each instrument.
   4.3.4. Playing Position. The Drum Major uses a visual command to signal the command
   Horns Up. There is no vocal command to bring the instruments to playing position. These
   visual commands are as follows:
       4.3.4.1. Stationary Horns Up. Band members first prepare to bring their instruments to
       playing position; this is the Ready Position. The visual command of Horns Up is
       executed in four parts. First, the Drum Major gives a preparatory arm signal with the
       right hand and forearm pointing up. Second, the Drum Major's arm comes down across
       the chest, parallel with the ground. Some instruments, such as horns, will move at this
       point, while other instruments will not. Third, the Drum Major will rearticulate the
       position parallel to the ground. This movement is necessary for the Drum Major to have
       the flexibility to delay the last movement of the Horns Up to coincide with a timed event
       within the ceremony (for example, the timing of Horns Up to occur as the honoree
       departs a vehicle.) For the fourth movement, the Drum Major's arm comes back to the up
       position (perpendicular to the ground). All the instruments simultaneously come up to
       playing position from the Ready position. Note: the Horns Up motion for band officers
       is similar to the motion for drum majors with the exception that the band officer’s arms
       mirror each other due to the lack of a mace (see Chapter 8).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                    59


       4.3.4.2. Marching Horns Up. When on the march, instruments come up with a mace
       command on the Roll-Off. The mace is held by the right hand on the staff near the
       ferrule. The mace is held vertically, centered on the body and lifted with the ball above
       the Drum Major's head. This signals the band members to prepare for the command of
       Horns Up, which follows the Roll-Off upon completion of the cadence sequence. Each
       instrument is different. See Chapter 7 for more information on mace commands.
       4.3.4.3. Stationary Horns Down. There is no vocal command given for Horns Down. At
       a Halt, the Drum Major lowers his or her arm, making a motion similar to the number 9.
       At the furthest vertical position of the arm, band members begin to lower their
       instruments. At the completion of the Drum Major’s motion, band members
       simultaneously complete their movement, placing their instruments in the carry position.
       Note: The Horns Down motion for band officers is similar to the motion for drum
       majors, except that the band officer’s arms mirror each other due to the lack of a mace
       (see Chapter 8).
       4.3.4.4. Marching Horns Down. When on the march, instruments are placed in the carry
       position immediately after completion of a piece as the cadence resumes. Each
       instrument assumes a different carriage position. See subsequent sections for specific
       instrument details.
4.4. Piccolo.
   4.4.1. Parade Rest. At the position of Parade Rest, the piccolo is cradled in the right hand
   with the head joint along the right arm. The right arm is placed across the front of the body.
   The left arm is placed across the front of the body with the left hand resting on top of the
   right hand. The hands meet in the center of the body with the arms hanging naturally and the
   palms facing towards the body (Figure 4.1.). The body position otherwise matches the
   standard position of Parade Rest.

   fist nor should the wrist be bent. The thumb of the left hand should rest along the joint of the
   forefinger and be placed along the seam of the trousers. The right arm hangs straight down
   the right side of the body with the instrument cradled in the palm of the right hand with the
   head joint along the right forearm.
   4.4.3. Attention. (Figure 4.2.). The command is “Tench HUT”. The right arm hangs
   straight down the right side of the body with the instrument cradled in the palm of the right
   hand with the head joint along the right forearm. The body position otherwise matches the
   standard position of Attention.

Figure 4.2. Piccolo, Attention Position.




   4.4.4. Horns Up. On the initiation of the Drum Major’s command of Horns Up, the left hand
   crosses the body to place both hands on the piccolo. The right hand does not change
   position. On the completion of the command, the instrument is brought up to playing
   position.

   The left hand is cupped with the palm facing the leg. The hand should not be clenched into a
   fist nor should the wrist be bent. The thumb of the left hand should rest along the joint of the
   forefinger and be placed along the seam of the trousers. The right arm hangs straight down
   the right side of the body, with the instrument bell cradled in the palm of the right hand and
   the body of the clarinet along the right forearm.
   4.5.3. Attention. (Figure 4.5.). The command is “Tench HUT”. The feet come together.
   The left arm (not holding instrument) hangs straight down alongside the body. The left hand
   is cupped with the palm facing the leg. The hand should not be clenched into a fist nor
   should the wrist be bent. The thumb of the left hand should rest along the joint of the
   forefinger and be placed along the seam of the trousers. The right arm hangs straight down
   the right side of the body with the instrument cradled in the palm of the right hand with the

4.12. Percussion. For State Funerals, all drums will be draped in black cloth.
   4.12.1. Snare Drum or Tenor Drum. Snare drums and tenor drums will be worn on carriers.
   At the discretion of the local commander, the drums can be worn level or on an angle with
   the player’s left side being more elevated than the player’s right side. All snare and tenor
   drums in a section must be worn the same way to provide a uniform appearance.
       4.12.1.1. Parade Rest. (Figure 4.27.). At the position of Parade Rest, the sticks are held
       in the right hand with the stick tips opposite of each other. The right hand rests on the
       rim of the drum nearest the body. The left hand rests on the right hand. The body
       position otherwise matches that of a normal position of Parade Rest. During periods of
       prolonged Parade Rest, the drum can be removed and placed on the ground in front of the
       player. The player will always hold the sticks.

                                            Chapter 5

                                 MANUAL OF PERCUSSION

5.1. Percussion Positions. See Chapter 4 for descriptions.
5.2. Cadences and Drum Beats. Cadences are played while on the march or while stationary to
march troops into position. The tempo should always be quarter note = 112 for ceremonies and
funerals. See Chapter 11 for the printed music. Cadences may be played either with snare drum
and bass drum, tenor drum and bass drum, or snare drum, bass drum, and cymbals.
   5.2.1. If the mace command for a Seven-Count Cut Off is given during a musical selection
   on the march, play the Seven-Count Cut Off and go to a cadence.
   5.2.2. If the mace command for a Seven-Count Cut Off is given during a cadence, go to a
   drum tap (one snare/tenor drum player plays a simple tap on the drum head).
   5.2.3. If the mace command for a Seven-Count Cut Off is given during a drum tap, go to a
   stick tap (one snare/tenor drum player clicks their sticks together).
   5.2.4. If the mace command for a Roll-Off is given during a drum tap, go to a cadence.
   5.2.5. If the mace command for a Roll-Off is given during a cadence, go to a Roll-Off upon
   completion of the current cadence sequence.
5.3. Roll-Off. A Roll-Off is an eight-count percussion cadence to indicate that the band should
bring instruments up and prepare to play at the end of the eight counts. The Drum Major raises
the mace by the shaft with the ball in the air, directly in front of the body and perpendicular with
the ground. This is the signal for a Roll-Off. When the Drum Major drops the mace, grabbing it
just below the ball, the Roll-Off begins. See Chapter 7 for pictures and further descriptions. The
Roll-Off motion used by the drum major can also signal that the drummers should go to a drum
tap from a stick tap or go to a cadence from a drum tap.
5.4. Seven-Count Cut Off. The Seven-Count Cut Off is a musical device used by the
percussion section to end a musical selection at any point in the music. It can also be used to
signal a drum tap from a cadence or a stick tap from a drum tap. The Seven-Count Cut Off can
be modified to fit any meter. The only occasion to use a Seven-Count Cut Off in 3/4 time is
during the "Inspection Waltz." See Chapter 11 for the printed music.
5.5. Honors. Solo drummers will only render honors in the form of a salute during wreath
laying ceremonies or at Modified Full Honors Funerals.
5.6. Casing Rolls. A drummer may be required to perform a buzz roll or closed roll to provide
musical support to the furling or unfurling of flags during promotion, activation and deactivation
ceremonies, or Full Honors Funerals. Casing rolls begin as the flag bearer drops the pole of the
personal colors flag level to the ground. The roll ends after the cased or uncased flag is raised to
its original position perpendicular to the ground.
5.7. Muffled Ruffles. Muffled ruffles may be played during a wreath laying ceremony. The
drummer plays four evenly spaced rolls as part of honors. Following the playing of muffled
ruffles, the drummer renders a hand salute. After the drummer salutes, the solo bugler sounds
Taps. (See paragraphs 9.11., 10.12., 11.4.6. and Figure 11.26.).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                      81


5.8. Modified Full Honors Funerals. A tenor drummer is used to supply musical support for
Full Honors Funerals without a band. The sequence of events mirrors that of a conventional Full
Honors Funeral (See paragraph 9.5.3.3. for more information). The tenor drummer performs a
roll during the transfer of remains from chapel to caisson (if it is a chapel service), hearse to
caisson (if there is a transfer service), and caisson to gravesite. The tenor drummer brings sticks
out on the commander of troops (COT) command of “Present ARMS” before any of these rolls
and begins to play after the COT’s saber completes its downward motion. A funeral cadence is
played without a bass drum to march the troops from transfer site to gravesite. During the
rendering of honors the tenor drummer, as the acting Drum Major, will salute. No music will be
played in place of the Air Force Hymn.

                                            Chapter 6

                                 MANUAL OF THE BUGLE

6.1. Bugle Calls. The music for all bugle calls is included with this manual in Chapter 11. For
additional information about bugle calls, contact The USAF Band, Ceremonial Brass. Multiple
trumpeters/buglers together sound Adjutant's Call, Assembly, Retreat, Reveille, Ruffles and
Flourishes, To The Color, and marches. Solo trumpeters/buglers sound other calls as a rule. If
resources do not allow for a band to be present, the bugler may play any bugle call as a soloist.
6.2. Bugle Honors.
   6.2.1. The Flag Officer's March is used to render Honors to a naval flag officer. Ruffles and
   Flourishes always precede the Flag Officer’s March. Though normally sounded by a band, a
   modified bugle call may be played if a band is not present.
   6.2.2. The General's March is used to render Honors to a general officer. Ruffles and
   Flourishes always precede the General’s March. Though normally sounded by a band, a solo
   bugler may also play it.
   6.2.3. Honors for Visiting Dignitaries. Foreign military and civilian personnel of equivalent
   U.S. military rank may be accorded Honors. A bugler may be asked to play any Honors calls
   for visiting dignitaries.
   6.2.4. Ruffles and Flourishes is a brief fanfare used in rendering Honors to a designated
   person. Ruffles, a roll played on a drum, usually accompany Flourishes, but Flourishes can
   be sounded minus the Ruffles. The number of Ruffles and Flourishes is determined by rank
   of the distinguished person. One Star equals one Ruffle and Flourish; two Stars equal two
   Ruffles and two Flourishes; three Stars equal three Ruffles and three Flourishes; and four
   Stars equal four Ruffles and Flourishes. Ruffles and Flourishes are followed by the
   corresponding Honors march. Reference Attachment 2 for the number of honors a dignitary,
   elected official, or military officer is accorded.
   6.2.5. Taps, the most solemn of all bugle calls, is performed only at the following
   ceremonial events:
       6.2.5.1. The end of the military day, one hour after Tattoo.
       6.2.5.2. Military funerals.
       6.2.5.3. Memorial services.
       6.2.5.4. Wreath laying ceremonies.
       6.2.5.5. Authorized Version of Taps. The only authorized version of Taps is included in
       Chapter 11. No other version or arrangement, such as Echo Taps, is authorized. Taps
       must be sounded using a trumpet, cornet, or regulation bugle. It must be played unmuted
       and unaccompanied. A U.S. flag should be present during the performance of Taps. If a
       color team is present, they should be at the position of Present Arms. Taps should not be
       performed at ceremonies commemorating members whose current status is defined as
       Missing In Action (MIA).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                      83


       6.2.5.6. Pre-recorded Music. In situations where a live bugler cannot be present, playing
       a recorded version of Taps is authorized. Copies can be obtained from The USAF Band
       at http://www.USAFband.af.mil.
       6.2.5.7. Performance Guidelines. Sounding Taps at ceremonies is the most sacred duty a
       bugler can perform. The call should be sounded with conviction and not rushed. Careful
       attention should be paid to the rhythm of the 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th and 14th notes of
       Taps to insure that they are played as straight eighth notes, not as dotted eighth and
       sixteenth notes.
       6.2.5.8. Performance Procedures at Funerals.           Buglers report to the officer or non-
       commissioned officer in charge (OIC or NCOIC) of the funeral detail. The bugler is
       positioned near the gravesite angled from the firing party, taking care to position
       him/herself where the sound will carry to the funeral party and where they can be seen.
       The bell of the instrument should be pointed towards the casket or urn. The bugler
       renders a hand salute as the remains are carried to the gravesite. The bugler then goes to
       Parade Rest. When the service is complete, the OIC or NCOIC will command Present
       Arms. The firing party will go to the position of Attention and fire three volleys. Once
       the third volley has been fired, the bugler should bring the instrument up to playing
       position. The firing party commander will give Present Arms. When the firing party's
       commander salutes, Taps is sounded. After sounding Taps, the bugler will render a hand
       salute and then will go to Order Arms at the command of the OIC or NCOIC of the firing
       party. If a firing party is not available, the bugler will sound Taps upon completion of the
       service at an arranged signal by the OIC, NCOIC, or officiating person. After sounding
       Taps, the bugler will render a hand salute and Order Arms on his or her own. The
       playing of a recording of a firing volley is not authorized. Address questions concerning
       firing volleys to the USAF Honor Guard.
       6.2.5.9. Performance Procedures at Other Ceremonies. The bugler reports to the officer
       or noncommissioned officer in charge, point of contact, or officiating person for the
       ceremony. The bugler sounds Taps at a designated signal. After sounding Taps, the
       bugler renders a hand salute and Order Arms with the formation, color team, or on own if
       neither is present.
6.3. Drum and Bugle Details. A drummer and a bugler may be required to provide ceremonial
music in lieu of a full band. All sequences remain the same. The drummer plays drum rolls for
the casing of the flag. The bugler sounds Honors, To The Color, and other necessary bugle calls.
6.4. Funerals. Full Honors Funerals can consist of a chapel service, an optional parade to the
graveside using a ceremonial band, an optional remains transfer, or a graveside service.
Standard Honors Funerals are usually graveside ceremonies that may include a chapel service.
For information on the sequence, refer to Chapter 9. The sounding of Taps is required at Full
Honors Funerals and Standard Honors Funerals.
   6.4.1. Full Honors Funerals. During a Full Honors Funeral, the bugler is part of the band.
   After the band plays while the remains transfer from the caisson/hearse to the grave at the
   gravesite, the band is given the command Parade Rest. This is the bugler's cue to step out of
   the formation. The bugler will be positioned so that line of sight with the chaplain is
   maintained. The chaplain's salute is the signal for the escort to render Honors. The firing
   party will fire three volleys, and the bugler will get ready to play. Once the third volley has
84                                                          AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


  been fired, the bugler should bring the instrument up to playing position. The firing party
  commander will give Present Arms. When the firing party's commander salutes, Taps is
  sounded. At the completion of Taps, the bugler will bring the instrument down and salute.
  When the firing party's commander gives Order Arms, the bugler lowers the salute and
  assumes the position of Attention. When the firing party departs, the bugler departs.
  6.4.2. Standard Honors Funerals. For a Standard Honors Funeral, the bugler is the sole band
  member. The bugler should arrive before the funeral begins and is required to be in position
  when the remains are transferred from the caisson/hearse to the gravesite. The bugler stands
  at Attention or Parade Rest along with the firing party. The bugler should have line of sight
  to the chaplain as his salute signals the firing party to render honors of three volleys. After
  the firing party fires the third volley, the bugler brings the instrument up to playing position.
  The firing party commander gives Present Arms. The bugler sounds Taps when the firing
  party's commander salutes. At the completion of Taps, the bugler brings the instrument
  down and salutes. When the firing party's commander gives Order Arms, the bugler lowers
  the salute and assumes the position of Attention. When the firing party departs, the bugler
  departs.

                                 MANUAL OF THE MACE

7.1. Accoutrements. The wear of the uniform for the drum major will include the following
items (see Figure 7.1.):
   7.1.1. White gloves with optional gauntlets should be clean and serviceable.
   7.1.2. A wheel hat or bearskin headpiece.
   7.1.3. Baldric.
7.2. Drum Major. The drum major is responsible for the execution, bearing, and discipline of
the ceremonial performing ensemble.
7.3. The Mace. Drum Majors use a mace to give commands while in formation. The mace is
often easier for band members to see while marching or standing in formation (Figure 7.2.).

Figure 7.2. Mace.




7.4. Carriage and Marching.
   7.4.1. Carriage of the Mace. Depending upon usage, the mace is carried in either the left or
   right hand. If the mace is being used to issue commands, then it will be transferred to the
   right hand at the start of the command sequence. For regular carriage and stationary
   commands, the left hand is used. When carried in the left hand, the mace will be grasped at a
   point approximately one foot below the ball, at the top of the shaft, at a point where the mace
   is balanced. The fingers will look similar to a traditional style percussion grip. The ball of
   the mace will be maintained in an orientation above the shoulder, thus making it visible to
   the troop formation when changes occur and commands are issued (Figure 7.3.).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                     87


Figure 7.3. Drum major conducting.




   7.4.2. At Attention. At the position of Attention, the mace is held at the balance point in the
   left hand with the first two fingers and thumb gripping the shaft and the other fingers tucked
   into the palm. The mace is held at a 60-degree angle from the plane of the ground. The shaft
   is parallel to an imaginary line that passes through the center of the hips.
   7.4.3. Arm Swing. The Drum Major's arm swing is similar to that of the instrumentalists.
   The arm swings six inches to the front and three inches to the rear, reaching the apex of front
   and rear on each pulse.
   7.4.4. Marching. (Figure 7.4.). When marching with the mace, the Drum Major will carry
   the mace in the left hand.

Figure 7.5. Drum Major at Parade Rest.




   7.4.6. Saluting. (Figure 7.6.). Whether marching or stationary, the Drum Major should turn
   towards the officer in charge to render a salute.

Figure 7.6. Drum Major Saluting.




   7.4.7. Conducting. (Figure 7.3.). The Drum Major conducts with the right hand, holding the
   mace in the left hand.
7.5. Carry and Grounded Positions of Attention. For the grounded position, the ferrule at the
base of the mace is grounded one inch from the right corner of the right foot. The mace is
positioned at a 45-degree angle to the right relative to the orientation of the body. The arm is
slightly bent, relaxed, and not fully extended (Figure 7.7.).
   7.5.1. Movement to Carry Position. (Figures 7.7. through 7.10.). As the mace is lifted, the
   drum major pushes the ball of the mace in a circular motion in a wide arc away from the
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                               89


   body and into the left hand. The ferrule should remain stationary relative to its initial
   position.

   7.5.2. Movement to Grounded Position. (Figures 7.11. through 7.14.). The right hand
   moves in a wide arc away from the body to grip the mace in a position between the left hand
   and the ball of the mace. Keeping the ferrule in a relative horizontal position, the right hand
   moves the mace in a wide arc to the right, lowering the mace to make contact with the
   ground an inch from the right foot. The left hand will move simultaneously to the side of the
   body with the arced movement of the mace. At the point of contact between the ferrule and
   the ground, the mace will be perpendicular with the ground. The mace then moves to a 45-
   degree angle to the right relative to the orientation of the body. The arm is slightly bent,
   relaxed, and not fully extended.

grounded position of Attention. At the command of execution, the left foot moves to an open
position into Parade Rest as the right arm extends forward, pushing the mace away from the
body. Then, lift the mace so that it is centered with line of the body, bringing the right hand into
the left hand, with the top of the ball of the mace directly in front of the face. The left thumb will
be on top of the right thumb with the fingers curled comfortably around the right hand. Slowly
lower the mace until it makes contact with the ground, maintaining its parallel position with the
line of the body. The ferrule will be centered between the toes. Then push the ball of the mace
away from the body, with the arms slightly bent, relaxed, and not fully extended.

left shoulder and the shaft of the mace passing through the right hip. The left hand will move
simultaneously to the side of the body. Next, simultaneously push the mace down and to the
right, following the line of the shaft and turn the head away from the commander of troops
(COT). The right arm will be fully extended and the head will be at a 45-degree angle. Then
bring the mace back to the previous position with the ball of the mace centered over the left
breast. The left hand will grip the mace beneath the point of contact with the right hand. The
left hand is now in Carry Position. The right arm forms a wide arc to the side of the body, into
the Attention position. At the command of execution, the left foot moves into the Attention
position.

7.8. Procession Mace Commands. Processions include parades, funerals, and reviews.
   7.8.1. Roll-Off. (Figures 7.25. through 7.28.). Start in Carry position. Bring the mace into a
   position centered on the body with the bottom of the ball of the mace at eye level. The right
   hand will grip the mace on the shaft at the furthest reachable point above the ferrule. The
   right arm will be fully extended. The left hand will grip the mace with the thumb extended
   upwards along the line of the mace with the fingers curled comfortably along the shaft at the
   previous point of contact. Simultaneously lift the mace with the right hand directly upwards,
   following the line of the shaft and bring the left hand to the side of the body. The right hand
   is curled into a fist around the shaft of the mace, and the right forearm is parallel to the
   ground. At the point of execution, drop the mace by opening the right hand and allowing the
   shaft to pass through the fist, catching it at the previous point of contact with the left hand.
   The mace will be perpendicular with the ground. Move the mace in a counterclockwise arc,
   ending with the mace lifted to the right side of the body. The tip of the ferrule will be
   relative to the left hip with the shaft of the mace passing through the right shoulder. The
   right arm should be slightly bent. The band’s instruments come up with the mace’s upwards
   motion, arriving in playing position on the mace’s arrival point. On the count before the
   band plays, position the mace along the line of the shaft so that the right arm is fully
   extended. On the count that the band plays, bring the mace back into Carry position,
   following the line of the shaft of the mace.

   7.8.2. Horns Up. (Figures 7.29. through 7.31.). The mace command for Horns Up is given
   from the stationary position before the command of Forward March is given. Start with the
   mace in the grounded position, facing away from the band in column formation. Lower the
   right hand on the mace until it is at the point of Carry position. The next motions will be
   done in a slow, rhythmic four-count motion. On the first count, tap the mace on the ground.
   On the second count, lift the mace in a counterclockwise arc, passing at eye level until it is
   relative to the left shoulder and perpendicular to the ground. The right hand should be just
   below the left shoulder. On the third count, lower the mace in a counterclockwise arc,
   passing below the sternum, then lifting until it is to the right of the right shoulder and at eye
   level with the mace at a 45-degree angle in the plane of the body, the ball to the exterior and
   the ferrule to the interior. At the command of execution for Forward March, position the
   mace along the line of the shaft so that the right arm is fully extended. On the count that the
   band plays, bring the mace back into Carry position, following the line of the shaft of the
   mace. The band plays on the first step.

   7.8.3. Seven-Count Cut Off with Mace. (Figures 7.32. through 7.39.). Start in Carry
   position. This is a timed event, comprising the last 15 counts of a march. On count 1, the
   mace is brought to the center of the body, perpendicular with the ground, with the ball at eye
   level and the left hand gripping the shaft just above the ferrule. On count 2, while the mace
   remains stationary in the left hand, turn the right hand so that the thumb is down and the
   palm faces to the right. The right hand is in the same place on the mace that it was on count
   1. On counts 3 and 4, rotate the mace in a clockwise motion so that it is at a 45-degree angle
   with the ball down by the left hip and the ferrule up by the right shoulder. Both hands will
   still be on the mace. On counts 5 and 6, the left hand comes to the side of the body as the
   mace remains stationary at the 45-degree angle. On counts 7, 8, and 9, draw a modified letter
   “J” with the right hand until the mace is lifted to the right of the right shoulder and at eye
   level with the mace at a 45-degree angle in the plane of the body, the ball to the exterior, and
   the ferrule to the interior. The mace will not deviate from the 45-degree angle as it moves.
   For counts 10, 11, and 12, maintain the current position. On count 13, position the mace
   towards the center line of the body and on a line parallel with the ground towards the center
   of the body. The right hand will be in front of the face. On count 14, position the mace back
   to its previous position, following the line of the shaft of the mace. On count 15, position the
   mace to its position on count 13. The percussion’s Seven-Count Cut Off will be played on
   counts 9 through 15. After this event, lower the mace in a counterclockwise motion so that it
 100                                                      AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


   ends in the left-handed Carry position. The right hand returns to the side of the body along
   the seam of the pants. The band’s instruments will come down automatically on what would
   be count 17, and their free hand returns to the side of the body on count 19.

   7.8.4. Return to Carry Position. (Figures 7.39.-7.44.). From the ending position of the
   Seven-Count Cut, lower and rotate the right wrist so that the mace rotates counter-clockwise
   from a point in the center of the shaft. The hand passes through a position at waist level
   (Figures 7.39-41.). Continue rotating the mace. It will pass through a position with the right
   hand at neck level, palm facing forward (Figure 7.42.). From this position, move the mace to
   the left and into the left hand (Figure 7.43.). The right hand lowers to the side of the body
   (Figure 7.44.). If in motion, continue arm swing.

   7.8.5. Mace Body Walk (Simplified version). (Figures 7.45.-7.47.). On count 1 of each
   measure, from the right handed Carry position, lift the mace so that it is at the top of the
   chest, still in a 45-degree angle Carry position, but higher (see Figure 7.45.). On count 2,
   bring the mace straight down to waist height, still at a 45-degree angle (see Figure 7.46.). On
   count 3, bring the mace back to the normal carry position at the sternum (see Figure 7.47.).
   On count 4, bring the mace down to the same position as count 2. On each motion, there
   should be a snap at the apex of movement, defining the pulse. Left-hand arm swing continues
   throughout all repetitions. Continue until ready for Seven-Count Cut.

   7.8.6. Drum Major Flourish. (Figure 7.48.-7.52.).This action can only be performed from
   Carry position in the left hand. Bring the mace to the center of the body with the left hand as
   the right hand is positioned with the fingers on the left of the shaft and the thumb on the right
   of the shaft (Figure 7.48.). Rotate the mace in a counter-clockwise direction with a rotation
   point centered between each hand. The shaft will fall into the palm of the right hand (Figure
   7.49.). Continue the rotation. The ball of the mace will be towards the ground as the left
   hand releases the shaft (Figure 7.50.). Continue the rotation. The ball of the mace will lift to
   the right (Figure 7.51.). Continue the rotation as the left hand positions itself on the right
   side of the mace, palm facing the shaft. The mace will be upright by this time, both hands
   grasping the Mace, palms facing to the right (Figure 7.52.). Lift the mace into a Roll-Off
   Position (Figure 7.26.), into a Present Arms Position, or into a position to execute a turn
   signal.

   7.8.7. Drum Major Turn Signal (Figure 7.53.). When performing square or column turns,
   the Drum Major will signal the point of execution. To do so, from the left-hand Carry
   Position, push the mace to the left side of the body. It will be perpendicular to the ground
   with the left hand about shoulder height with the thumb placed along the interior of the shaft.
   Pull the mace straight into the body and back into the original position maintaining the
   perpendicular orientation.

7.9. Formation Commands.
   7.9.1. Horns Up. (Figures 7.54.-7.56.). This can be done either with the hand or the mace
   when facing toward the band. If facing away from the band, it must be done with the mace.
   (See paragraph 7.8.2.). If done when facing the band in stationary position, it happens in a
   four-count motion. On count 1, lift the right (conducting) hand so that the arm makes a
   backwards “L” with the fingers fully extended upwards (Figure 7.54.). Pause briefly while
   the euphoniums lift their instruments and the sousaphones and percussion put their
   instruments on. On count 2, lower the forearm to the left. The forearm will now be parallel
   to the ground at chin level (Figure 7.55.). On count 3, slightly lift the fingers to rearticulate,
   or tap, while the forearm remains stationary. On count 4, lift the arm so that it is in the same
   position as count 1 (Figure 7.56.). Instrumentalist responsibilities for following this
   command are listed in Chapter 4. After the horns are up, lower the arm into a conducting
   position.

Figure 7.54. Count 1, Horns Up.

AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                     109


Figure 7.56. Count 4, Horns Up.




   7.9.2. Seven-Count Cut Off with Hand. (Figures 7.57.-7.59.). This is done while facing the
   band in a stationary position. The count structure is 4 counts shorter than that of the Seven-
   Count Cut Off with the mace; it comprises the last 11 counts of a march. On counts 1
   through 4, draw a circle with the right (conducting) hand in a counterclockwise motion until
   it ends above and to the right of the right shoulder (Figure 7.57.). The right hand will be in a
   fist. The arm will not be fully extended. On counts 5 through 8, keep the right hand
   stationary (Figure 7.58.). On count 9, position the fist to the right (outside), on count 10
   position the fist back to the left (inside), and on count 11 position the fist back to the right
   (outside) (Figure 7.59.). It will remain briefly stationary before coming back to the side of
   the body along the seam of the pants.

   7.9.3. Horns Down. (Figures 7.60.-7.62.). This can be done either with the hand or the
   mace when facing toward the band. If facing away from the band, it must be done with the
   mace, using the Seven-Count Cut Off (see paragraph 7.8.3.). When facing the band and
   conducting with the hands, after the Seven-Count Cut Off with hand, pause briefly after the
   band stops. Then slowly draw the number “9” with the right (conducting) hand until the
   hand ends at the side of the body along the seam of the pants. The horns come down with the
   motion of the drum major’s hand. The free hand comes down to the side of the body along
   the seam of the pants in a uniform motion after the horns come down and without a motion or
   command from the drum major (Figures 7.60., 7.61., and 7.62.).

7.10. Drum Major Responsibilities.
   7.10.1. Alignment in Formation. The Drum Major must align him/herself so that the largest
   number of band members can see the mace and conducting hand. The Drum Major must be
   in line of sight with the bass drum and the commander of troops (COT).
   7.10.2. Uniform Issues. Ceremony organizers and the COT determine the uniform for the
   ceremony prior to the event’s commencement. It is the Drum Major’s responsibility to
   convey the information to the band in a timely manner before the ceremony.
   7.10.3. Chain of Command in Formation. In any ceremony, the COT is at the top of the
   chain of command. The Drum Major takes commands from the COT. However, the Drum
   Major has the responsibility to give commands that will allow the band to safely and
   comfortably accomplish its mission. In certain circumstances, the Drum Major may give
   commands that differ from the COT when necessitated by safety, weather, or musical
   concerns. Instrument weight may cause band members to fatigue faster than other troops.
   For example, during prolonged periods of Parade Rest, the Drum Major may need to give the
   command Rest.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                    113


                                           Chapter 8

                                    THE BAND OFFICER

8.1. Responsibilities. Band officers must be commissioned officers serving in the band career
field. It is not appropriate for commissioned officers to serve in the capacity of the drum major;
this position is reserved for the enlisted corps. The band officer is responsible for musical
aspects of ceremonies that occur while the band is stationary. Band officers defer commands
involving movement of the band to the drum major. During ceremonies, band officers are
responsible to bring horns up, conduct music, and bring horns down when they are in front of the
band. If the band is in place before a ceremony, the band officer can change places with the
drum major, and the band officer may conduct the pre-ceremony music (if applicable). The band
officer conducts all music until the Sound Off and/or the Pass In Review (if applicable) when the
band officer changes places with the drum major. If a Pass In Review occurs, the band officer
changes places with the drum major, and the drum major leads the band through the remainder of
the ceremony. Band officers may conduct the entirety of any kind of sit down ceremony,
including patriotic openers, White House garden tours, promotions, and other indoor ceremonies.
Unlike drum majors, band officers are not required for all ceremonies.

Figure 8.1. Band Officer with Medals.




8.2. Placement in Formations. In a band formation, when not conducting, the band officer will
always occupy a position 60 inches to the right of the first person in the right most file (see
Figure 8.2.). The drum major and band officer will occupy the same positions, although they are
interchangeable during the ceremony when a band officer is present.
 114                                                        AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


Figure 8.2. Normal Ceremonial Band Formation.




8.3. Band Officer Movements.
   8.3.1. Horns Up. The visual command for Horns Up has four separate movements. First,
   the band officer brings both hands up as a signal for the sousaphones and euphoniums to pick
   up their instruments (Figure 8.3.). Other instrumentalists move their hands in preparation for
   Horns Up. In the second part of Horns Up, the band officer brings both hands to chest level
   (Figure 8.4.). This signals the trumpet, horn, and trombone sections to move their hands to
   their instruments in preparation for the final movement. The third motion of Horns Up is a
   rearticulation of the position with hands parallel to the ground (also Figure 8.4.). No
   movement from the band members other than horn section should occur on this motion. In
   the last part of Horns Up, the band officer brings both arms back to the original preparatory
   position, perpendicular to the ground (Figure 8.5.).

Figure 8.3. Position 1, Horns Up.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                              115


Figure 8.4. Positions 2 and 3, Horns Up.




Figure 8.5. Position 4, Horns Up.




   8.3.2. Horns Down. The band officer moves both hands in the same manner as the drum
   major, drawing a number “9” with the right hand and mirroring it with the left hand. Band
   members begin to bring their instruments down at the uppermost portion of the motion and
   complete their movement as the band officer’s hands drop down to the side (Figures 8.6.
   through 8.9.).

Figure 8.9. Completion of Horns Down.




8.4. Changing Positions. The band officer often changes position with the drum major during
the ceremony in order to conduct music while the band is stationary. The band officer and drum
major do a facing movement as shown in Figure 8.10., then exchange positions simultaneously.
The band officer moves at a straight diagonal to assume the drum major’s position, and the drum
major assumes the band officer’s position using a 90-degree square turn. When the drum major
needs to return to take command of the band, the drum major and the band officer do a facing
move as shown in Figure 8.11., then the drum major moves back to position using a straight
diagonal. The band officer moves back simultaneously using a 90-degree square turn.

Figure 8.11. Changing Positions, Drum Major Conducting.




8.5. Positions. The band officer, while carrying a baton, is considered to be "under arms" and is
therefore subject to the same restrictions and regulations as someone with an instrument or rifle.
   8.5.1. Position of Attention. Band officers carry the baton in the right hand unless saluting.
   The position of Attention is otherwise the same as for other members (Figure 8.12.).

Figure 8.12. Position of Attention.




   8.5.2. Parade Rest. The hands are crossed in front of the body with the left hand resting on
   the right. The Baton is held in the right hand (Figure 8.13.).
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                      119


Figure 8.13. Band Officer at Parade Rest with Baton.




   8.5.3. Saluting. Band Officers must transfer the Baton from their right hand to their left
   prior to executing a salute. Band Officers then salute normally. During the Salute, the Baton
   is held in the left hand to the side of the body parallel with the seam of the pants (Figure
   8.14.).

Figure 8.14. Officer Saluting with Baton.




8.6. Seven-Count Cut Off with Hand. This is done while facing the band in a stationary
position and can be given at any time. However, it is optimal to begin the motion during the
second bar of the repeated “dummy” drum cadence when marching troops. The motion
comprises the last 11 counts of a march. On counts 1 through 4, draw a circle with the left hand
in a clockwise motion until it ends above and to the right of the right shoulder (Figure 8.16.).
The right hand will be in a fist (Figure 8.17.). The arm will not be fully extended. On counts 5
through 8 (the first four counts of the percussion Seven-Count Cut), keep the left hand stationary.
On count 9, position the fist to the left (outside); on count 10 position the fist back to the right
 120                                                          AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


(inside); and on count 11 position the fist back to the left (outside) (Figures 8.17-8.19.). It will
remain briefly stationary before coming back to the side of the body along the seam of the pants

9.1. Normal Ceremonial Band Formation. (Figure 9.1.).

Figure 9.1. Normal Ceremonial Band Formation.




   9.1.1. In the normal ceremonial band formation, band members are 60 inches or two “6 to 5”
   steps apart, front to back and side to side. The distance between them is called an interval.
   The Drum Major stands a distance from the band that is equal to 1/2 the width of the band.
   The band officer is not included in the width of the band. The band officer stands 60 inches
   to the right of the right file and is even with the front rank. A band can have as few as 15
   members (3 x 5) and a drum major or as many as 99 (9 x 11) with a Drum Major. An odd
   number of files provides a center file on which to dress.
   9.1.2. Instrument Placement. Though band officers and NCOICs decide instrument
   placement, the following is a suggested formation. Place all the trombones in the front rank
   of the band to allow for the projection of their slides and to reduce the risk of injury when the
   band halts. Place horns directly behind the trombones, aligned to the right in the second rank
   for maximum projection. If the horn rank is not filled, add trumpets to the horns' left or place
   the trumpets behind the horns. Place the percussion behind the trumpets with the bass drum
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                    123


   on an exterior file next to the snare (or tenor) drums. Place piccolos, clarinets, and
   saxophones in score order in any empty spots to the percussion’s right and in ranks behind
   the percussion. Place euphoniums to the right or behind the percussion and sousaphones in
   the back rank to avoid obstructing the line of sight to the drum major's mace commands.
   Euphoniums can also fill gaps in the percussion and sousaphone ranks. Avoid dividing
   instrument groups. When necessary, leave any holes in the band in the back rank.

   9.1.3. Guide Files. With an odd number of files, the center file is considered the guide file.
   All other files maintain side-to-side alignment using the center (or guide) file. With an even
   number of files, the file right of center becomes the guide file.
9.2. Arrivals. After the band marches into position, the drum major takes the band through a
dressing sequence. If the arrival is on a flight line, the band should be positioned centered on
and facing into the Cordon, as shown (Figure 9.3.). Note that the band may be positioned on
either side of the Cordon, as long as they are centered and facing into the Cordon. If the arrival

is not on a flight line, the band will position itself within line of sight of the cordon COT and the
arriving vehicles.

Figure 9.3. Flight Line Arrivals.




9.3. Change of Command Ceremonies. The formation requirements for a change of command
ceremony are to be determined by the officer in charge (OIC). The formation may include
troops under the command of the transferring officer, other base troops, a band, and an Honor
Guard. A color team, a commander of troops (COT), and a guidon bearer are required. A
typical formation for a change of command ceremony is shown in Figure 9.4. If there is not
enough room to complete the maneuver, follow Figure 9.5. The dimensions of the flights and
the band are dictated by the OIC. The arrows show the band's path on the Pass In Review if
required.

Figure 9.5. Pass in Review with Countermarch.




   9.3.1. There is an alternate position for the band in the center of the formation (see Figure
   9.6.). The color team must wheel every time the band moves into or out of this position. The
   band will march forward for the Pass In Review while the troops perform a regular passing
   sequence.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                 127


Figure 9.6. Pass In Review with Alternate Band Position.




   9.3.2. For more information regarding the band's role in the change of command ceremony
   and the Pass In Review, see Chapter 10.
9.4. Departures. Departure formations are identical to arrival formations. Only the sequences
change (See section 10.5.).
9.5. Funerals. There are two types of funerals, Full Honors Funerals and Standard Honors
Funerals. They differ by the type of units involved.
   9.5.1. Full Honors Funerals consist of a chapel service with a parade to the graveside, a
   remains transfer (optional), or just a graveside service. Air Force Full Honors Funerals may
   include the following elements:
       9.5.1.1. Body Bearers.
       9.5.1.2. Firing party.
       9.5.1.3. Bugler.
       9.5.1.4. Chaplain.
       9.5.1.5. Arlington Lady, representing the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (Arlington
       National Cemetery only).
       9.5.1.6. Escort for Arlington Lady (Arlington National Cemetery only).
       9.5.1.7. Color guard.
       9.5.1.8. Honor Guard Flight (number depends on rank of deceased).

      9.5.1.9. Band.
      9.5.1.10. Army Caisson team.
  9.5.2. Standard Honors Funerals contain the basic elements required for a funeral service.
  Standard Honor Funerals are usually graveside ceremonies that may include a chapel service.
  Air Force Standard Honors Funerals include the following elements:
      9.5.2.1. Body Bearers.
      9.5.2.2. Firing party.
      9.5.2.3. Bugler.
      9.5.2.4. Chaplain.
      9.5.2.5. Arlington Lady, representing the Chief of Staff, USAF (Arlington National
      Cemetery only).
      9.5.2.6. Escort for Arlington Lady (Arlington National Cemetery only).
  9.5.3. The single difference between Full Honors Funerals and Standard Honors Funerals
  exists in the formation of troops.
      9.5.3.1. Full Honors Funerals. A band for a full honors funeral should have a minimum
      of 15 members (brass and percussion) and a Drum Major. The core instrumentation
      consists of four trumpets/cornets, two horns, three trombones, one euphonium, one
      sousaphone, one tenor drum and one bass drum. Figure 9.7. shows a 15-member band
      facing the gravesite or chapel with the Drum Major in front. Figure 9.8. shows an 18-
      member band with the Drum Major at the top of the column. The Drum Major is four
      steps from the band (three ranks plus one to create a right triangle). The band members
      stand at a two-step interval (front to back and side to side). This formation is most
      convenient as it fits between gravestones in most cemeteries. The bugler for Taps should
      be in the center file so when he or she falls out to play Taps, the hole will not be as
      noticeable. These formations are part of the funeral escort and consist of a COT, a
      guidon bearer, a band, a color team, a flight (or two) of troops (or the Honor Guard), the
      Body Bearers, a caisson, and a chaplain. If the deceased was a general officer, the
      formation can also have the deceased's personal colors. The COT will march at the top of
      the column with the guidon bearer two steps behind and one step to the left. The Drum
      Major and band are 12 steps behind the COT. The band will be in three files (four steps
      wide), and the drum major stands four steps in front of the band. If more than one flight
      is in the funeral escort, then the first flight is six or more steps behind the band. If only
      one flight is present, the color team is six or more steps behind the band. The flight of
      troops or Honor Guard is six or more steps behind the color team. The flight commander
      stands four steps in front of the flight, as the flight is three files wide (four steps). When
      this formation is deployed in front of the grave or chapel, it will be arranged as shown in
      Figure 9.9. This position can be reversed. Figure 9.10. shows the order of march in
      formation. When the escort arrives at the gravesite, the COT will lead the escort into
      position (a pre-arranged position, dictated by the OIC). The COT will then perform a
      right-angle flank in the direction of the grave and Halt. The escort will continue until the
      color team is directly in front of the COT. The COT will give a Halt and a facing
      movement to the escort so that it is facing the gravesite.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                               129

Figure 9.10. Processions, March Order.




       9.5.3.2. The formation for a standard honors funeral has no COT, no guidon bearer, no
       band, and no additional troops or flights. The color team marches at the front of the
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                    131


       procession. The bugler is not part of the procession. The bugler arrives at the gravesite.
       At the gravesite, the bugler should be in a position to maintain line of sight with the
       chaplain. See Chapter 7.
       9.5.3.3. Modified Funerals. The formation for a modified funeral (transfer or chapel
       service) may have any combination of aforementioned elements involved. If there is no
       COT, the Drum Major takes responsibility for the escort. If a band is not present, a tenor
       drummer will serve in the capacity of the band. See Chapter 5 for more information.
       There should always be a color team. The bugler is not part of the procession. The
       bugler arrives at the gravesite prior to the event and reports directly to the OIC or NCOIC
       upon arrival. See Chapter 10.
9.6. Joint Service Ceremonies. These formations are identical to arrivals.
9.7. Parades. The number of personnel for the formation in a parade is determined by the event
requirements and the NCOIC or the Drum Major.
9.8. Patriotic Openers. A concert formation (traditional concert band seating in score order)
should be used when possible. The NCOIC must be aware of the space at the site before
personnel are assigned.
9.9. Retirement Ceremonies. The formation requirements for a retirement ceremony are
determined by the OIC. The formation may include troops under the command of the
transferring officer, other base troops, a band and an Honor Guard. A color team, a COT and a
guidon bearer are required. A usual formation for a change of command ceremony is shown in
Figures 9.4. or Figure 9.5. If there is not enough room to complete a Pass In Review maneuver,
follow the formation in Figure 9.6. The dimensions of the flights and the band are dictated by
the OIC.
9.10. Tattoos. Tattoos are generally different from other ceremonies. There is no standard
template for a Tattoo ceremony. There are, however, certain traditional parts of the ceremony
including the march-on, presentation of command, inspection, featured troops section, pass in
review, retirement of colors, sound tattoo, casing/folding of colors, Taps and march-off. Bearing
this in mind, the formation for a Tattoo can have any number of troop formations. The band may
even be seated at the site and not march in the ceremony. The formation must include a color
team, a COT (adjutant), and the featured troops.
9.11. Wreath Laying Ceremonies. The formation for an Air Force wreath laying ceremony
requires the band be near the site where the wreath is being laid (see Figure 9.11.). There are
sometimes two Color Teams, one on either side of the cordon. The band should maintain line of
sight to the COT at all times.

                                       CEREMONIES

10.1. Ceremonial Standard Practices.
   10.1.1. Seven-Count Cut. A Seven-Count Cut is used to end music and Halt troops and the
   colors.
   10.1.2. Dressing Sequence. A dressing sequence will often precede a ceremony in which the
   band is pre-positioned. The commands are “Dress RIGHT, DRESS” or “Dress LEFT,
   DRESS” for the alignment of rows (columns cover for alignment during the mark time
   before the halt), and Ready Front to complete the sequence. It is recommended that marks be
   put down before the ceremony for the front row and the column to which the band will dress
   (most often the interior column to the formation).
   10.1.3. Hail to the Chief. Hail to the Chief may only be performed for the President or for a
   former President’s remains.
      10.1.3.1. For a deceased President, play four Ruffles and Flourishes and the long version
      of Hail to the Chief, and a Hymn to transfer the remains to a vehicle.
      10.1.3.2. For The President, four Ruffles and Flourishes and Hail to the Chief must be
      played as the President arrives or for any defined Protocol function, as determined by the
      White House Protocol Office.
   10.1.4. When a Commander of Troops (COT) is present without a sword, the cue for the first
   note of music (i.e., Honors) is the apex of his hand salute. When the COT is present with a
   sword, the cue for the first note of music is the termination of the downward motion of the
   sword.
   10.1.5. Changing Music/Clearing Instruments. It is typical performance practice to change
   music and clear instruments immediately after the command Parade Rest. When on the
   march, musicians should change music immediately after Horns Down. Musicians should
   clear instruments immediately after Horns Up but before playing.
   10.1.6. Hand Salutes. Hand salutes should be rendered by the band leader while facing
   forward when commanded by the COT, when the colors pass in front, or when the U.S.
   Anthem is played, not by the band, but by a singer or pre-recorded music. After the band has
   played Honors or the U.S. Anthem, the band leader signals Horns Down, performs a three-
   count about face, and renders a hand salute. Lower the salute on the COT’s command of
   Order Arms following Present Arms.
   10.1.7. Inspection Music. The music for an inspection of troops must begin before the
   official party steps off to inspect the troops. The tempo must be established before they step
   off. Inspection music ends when the COT returns to the position by the guidon.
   10.1.8. Fanfares. Fanfares are used to honor dignitaries and official parties as they arrive or
   move into position. The fanfare may not be long enough to fill the time it takes to move
   them into position. A drum roll is authorized to continue the fanfare before the final cadence
   as needed.

     position. The Drum Major or band officer exchange may occur here. The band may then
     play a pre-ceremonial concert of march selections.
     10.2.1.5. Vehicle/official party arrives. The band is given the command Attention. The
     band leader gives Horns Up if a fanfare is to be played while the official party moves into
     position. The band leader then gives Horns Down.
     10.2.1.6. The band leader gives Horns Up. Once the official party is in position, the
     COT gives Present Arms. After the presentation of command, the band renders musical
     Honors (if appropriate):

       10.6.1.1.1. Placement and Formation. The escort formation and placement is
       determined before the ceremony begins. Before the arrival of the remains, the band
       and Honor Guard troops fall in at the designated assembly area. The Drum Major
       determines the proper placement of instruments in the band formation based on
       available personnel. The band will not be in column march but formed up in file
       formation. The direction (facing) of the escort formation is also determined by the
       location of the grave. The Honor Guard will be to the left or right of the band with
       space left between them for the colors to march in. The COT will be in front of the
       formation, centered with the guidon, facing the formation.
       10.6.1.1.2. Posting of Colors. The colors are posted 10 minutes prior to the arrival of
       the remains. The Drum Major gives the command Stand By to the band. The COT
       gives the escort formation Attention from Parade Rest. The COT gives the command
       Advance the Colors, and the colors march to the center of the formation between the
       band and the Honor Guard, placing them in a rank facing the COT. The band leader
       and COT salute the U.S. Flag at the COT’s order to Present Arms. They return to the
       position of Attention with the COT’s command Order Arms and give the flights a
       command for Rest while awaiting the arrival of the remains.
       10.6.1.1.3. Transfer of Remains to the Gravesite. Once the hearse or other vehicle
       arrives at the gravesite, the COT gives the escort the command Attention to prepare
       for the transfer of remains from the caisson to the grave. The band is given Horns Up
       when the body bearers are ready to transfer the remains from the caisson to the grave.
       Following Present Arms, the band plays a hymn for the transfer of remains. If the
       hymn ends while the body bearers are still carrying the remains to the grave, the band
       leader may either signal the band to repeat the hymn or cue the tenor drummer to play
       a roll until the remains are placed on the grave. The band leader will cue the
       drummer to end the roll with the saluting hand. The band leader will give Horns
       Down if a roll is not performed. The COT gives a command for Order Arms after the
       transfer is complete and the hymn has ended. This may result in a Parade Rest from
       the COT, if it is determined that Honors are rendered prior to the religious committal.
       If Honors are rendered first, there will be no Parade Rest. If this is the case, the
       bugler should leave the formation immediately to be in position for Taps.
 152                                                         AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


          10.6.1.1.4. Honors. The chaplain salutes. This is the cue for the COT to give the
          escort Attention. The band leader and COT then salute, and the firing party fires
          volleys. The firing party’s commander will give Present Arms. This is the cue for
          the bugler to sound Taps. The firing party will perform Present Arms. The bugler
          then sounds Taps. Once Taps is complete, the COT gives Order Arms. This
          command ends Honors.
          10.6.1.1.5. Completion of Ceremony. The band leader faces the band, gives Horns
          Up, and the band plays the Air Force Hymn while the body bearers fold the flag that
          was draped over the remains. Once the Air Force Hymn is complete, the band leader
          gives the band Horns Down and faces the grave. When the flag is handed to the
          family, the body bearers leave the gravesite and march to the dispersal site. The COT
          gives a command to face the escort toward the direction of the dispersal site. The
          Drum Major repositions in front of the band. As the COT repositions with the guidon
          bearer at the top of the column, the Drum Major commands a drum tap. When the
          COT arrives at the top of the column, he faces the escort and commands Forward
          March, and the escort marches back to the dispersal area. When the escort arrives at
          the dispersal site, the COT flanks off the formation and halts to give the escort Mark
          Time. The COT commands Halt followed by a command to face the escort toward
          him. The band leader repositions in front of the band. The COT gives Present Arms,
          Order Arms, Dismiss and Retire the Colors. The COT tells the flight commanders,
          including the band leader, to take charge of their flights. If the COT is an officer, the
          Drum Major salutes before giving the command Dismissed.
       10.6.1.2. Chapel Service. A chapel service involves the escort beginning the funeral at
       the chapel where the service for the deceased is held.

       10.6.1.2.1. Placement and Formation. The escort formation and placement is
       determined before the ceremony begins. Before the arrival of the remains, the band
       falls in at the designated assembly area. The Drum Major determines the proper
       placement of instruments in the band formation based on available personnel. The
       band will form up near the chapel with the back row facing direction of travel to the
       chapel.
       10.6.1.2.2. Posting of Colors. The posting of the colors is performed by the Honor
       Guard while the band is not yet present.
       10.6.1.2.3. March to the Chapel. When the COT, colors, and flight are in position in
       front of the chapel, and have completed their dressing sequence, the Drum Major will
       give the band Attention and Forward March. The band moves into position by the
       color team, automatically marks time, and the Drum Major gives the command Halt
       and is given a facing movement to face the chapel. The band is then put at Parade
       Rest.
       10.6.1.2.4. Transfer of Remains from Chapel to Caisson. When the doors of the
       chapel open, the COT commands the escort to Attention and gives the command
       Present Arms as the body bearers begin to move the remains towards caisson from the
       chapel. The band leader then gives the band a cue for Horns Up, which is followed
       by a hymn during the transfer of the remains from the chapel to the caisson. The
       band leader cues Horns Down following the hymn. After the COT gives Order Arms,
       the band may change its music for the next selection.
       10.6.1.2.5. Procession to the Gravesite. After the bearers secure the remains onto the
       caisson and the deceased’s family is ready, the COT gives the escort Attention
       followed by a facing movement to face the escort in the direction of the route to the
       grave. As the COT, the guidon bearer and the Drum Major reposition to the front of
       the escort, the Drum Major will either give Horns Up for a musical selection or signal
       for a drum cadence or drum tap. It is traditional to begin the procession with a
       musical selection. The drum tap is called if the procession is not on pavement. The
       COT then executes an About Face in order to give the command for Forward March.
       This command begins the processional of the remains to the gravesite with the drum
       cadence, drum tap, or musical selection beginning on the step off.
154                                                      AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


      10.6.1.2.6. Music Sequence. The sequence for the march includes various marches
      with a drum cadence played between musical selections. During the drum cadence,
      the Drum Major gives a mace command for a Roll-Off. Each march ends with a
      Seven-Count Cut Off cued by the Drum Major with the mace. The bass drummer
      plays the Seven-Count Cut Off. Following the Seven-Count Cut Off, the percussion
      section plays a funeral cadence until directed by the Drum Major to play a drum tap
      or Roll-Off. As a courtesy, the Drum Major should stop the music if another funeral
      is in close proximity.
      10.6.1.2.7. Transition to Drum Tap. Near the end of the march to the gravesite, the
      COT and the guidon bearer will flank off of the formation when the escort is adjacent
      to the gravesite. This is the percussion section leader’s cue to signal the conclusion of
      the drum cadence. The solo tenor drummer then plays a drum tap to march the band
      to the gravesite. At the gravesite, the COT will give Mark Time when the formation
      is in position followed by Halt and a facing movement of Left Face or Right Face to
      face the escort towards the grave. The Drum Major will then place the band at Parade
      Rest. If band members use lyred sheet music, they can change music during Parade
      Rest.
      10.6.1.2.8. Transfer of Remains to the Gravesite. Once the hearse or other vehicle
      arrives at the gravesite, the COT gives the escort Attention to prepare for the transfer
      of remains from the caisson to the grave. The band is given Horns Up when the body
      bearers are ready to transfer the remains from the caisson to the grave. Following
      Present Arms, the band plays a hymn for the transfer of remains. If the hymn ends
      while the bearers are still carrying the remains to the grave, the band leader may
      either signal the band to repeat the hymn or cue the tenor drummer to play a roll until
      the remains are placed on the grave. The band leader will cue the drummer to end the
      roll with the saluting hand. The band leader will give Horns Down if a roll is not
      performed. The COT gives a command for Order Arms after the transfer is complete
      and the hymn has ended. This may or may not result in a Parade Rest from the COT,
      if it is determined that Honors are rendered prior to the religious committal. If
      Honors are rendered first, there will be no Parade Rest. If this is the case, the bugler
      should leave the formation immediately to position him/herself for Taps.
      10.6.1.2.9. Honors. The chaplain salutes; this is the cue for the COT to give the
      escort the command of Attention. The band leader and COT then salute and the firing
      party fires volleys. The firing party’s commander will give Present Arms. This is the
      cue for the bugler to sound Taps. The firing party will perform Present Arms. The
      bugler then sounds Taps. Once Taps is complete, the COT gives Order Arms. This
      command ends Honors.
      10.6.1.2.10. Completion of Ceremony. The band leader faces the band, gives Horns
      Up, and the band plays the Air Force Hymn while the casket bearers fold the flag that
      was draped over the remains. Once the Air Force Hymn is complete, the band leader
      gives the band Horns Down and faces the grave. When the flag is handed to the
      family, the body bearers leave the gravesite and march to the dispersal site. The COT
      gives a command to face the escort toward the direction of the dispersal site. As the
      COT repositions with the guidon bearer at the top of the column, the Drum Major
      commands a drum tap. When the COT arrives at the top of the column, he faces the
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                  155


          escort and commands Forward March, and the escort marches back to the dispersal
          area. When the escort arrives at the dispersal site, the COT flanks off the formation
          and stops to give the escort the command for Mark Time. The COT commands Halt
          followed by a command to face the escort toward him. The band leader repositions in
          front of the band. The COT gives Present Arms, Order Arms, Dismiss, and Retire the
          Colors. The COT tells the flight commanders, including the drum major, to take
          charge of their flights. If the COT is an officer, the Drum Major salutes before
          dismissing the band.
      10.6.1.3. Transfer Service. A transfer service involves the escort awaiting the remains at
      a fixed point in the cemetery to transfer it by caisson to the gravesite.

      10.6.1.3.1. Placement and Formation. The escort formation and placement is
      determined before the ceremony begins. Before the arrival of the remains, the band
      and Honor Guard troops fall in at the designated assembly area. The Drum Major
      determines the proper placement of instruments in the band formation based on
      available personnel. The band will not be in column march but formed up in file
      formation. The direction (facing) of the escort formation is also determined by the
      location of the grave. The Honor Guard will be to the left or right of the band, with
      space left between them for the colors to march in. The COT will be in front of the
      formation, centered with the guidon bearer, facing the formation.
      10.6.1.3.2. Posting of Colors. The colors are posted 10 minutes prior to the arrival of
      the remains. The Drum Major gives the command of Stand By to the band. The
      COT gives the escort formation Attention from Parade Rest. The COT gives the
      command Advance the Colors, and the colors march in a route step to the center of
      the formation between the band and the Honor Guard placing them in a rank facing
      the COT. The band leader and COT salute the U.S. Flag at the COT’s order to
      Present Arms. They return to the position of Attention with the COT’s command
      Order Arms and give their flights a command to Rest while awaiting the arrival of the
      remains.
      10.6.1.3.3. Transfer of Remains to Caisson. Once the hearse or other vehicle arrives,
      the escort is given Attention to prepare for the transfer of remains from the vehicle to
      the caisson. The band is given Horns Up when the body bearers are ready to transfer
      the remains from the vehicle to the caisson. The COT gives Present Arms, does an
      about face, and salutes. The band then plays a hymn during the transfer. The COT
      gives Order Arms after the transfer is complete and the hymn has ended. The band
      leader gives Horns Down once the remains are on the caisson and the hymn is
      complete. After the COT gives Order Arms, the band may change its music for the
      next selection.
      10.6.1.3.4. Procession to the Gravesite. After the body bearers secure the remains
      onto the caisson and the deceased’s family is ready, the COT gives the escort
      Attention followed by a facing movement to face the escort in the direction of the
      route to the grave. As the COT, guidon bearer and Drum Major reposition to the
      front of the escort, the Drum Major will either give Horns Up for a musical selection
      or signal for a drum cadence or drum tap. It is traditional to begin the procession with
      a musical selection. The drum tap is called for if the procession is not on pavement.
      The COT then executes an About Face in order to give the command for Forward
      March. This command begins the processional of the remains to the gravesite with
      the drum cadence, drum tap, or musical selection beginning on the step off.
      10.6.1.3.5. Music Sequence. The sequence for the march includes various marches
      with a drum cadence played between musical selections. During the drum cadence,
      the drum major gives a mace command for a Roll-Off. Each march ends with a
      Seven-Count Cut Off cued by the Drum Major with the mace. The bass drummer
      plays the Seven-Count Cut Off. Following the Cut Off, the percussion section plays a
      funeral cadence until directed by the Drum Major to play a drum tap or Roll-Off. As
      a courtesy, the drum major should stop the music if another funeral is in close
      proximity.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                  157


       10.6.1.3.6. Transition to Drum Tap. Near the end of the march to the gravesite, the
       COT and the guidon bearer will flank off of the formation when the escort is adjacent
       to the gravesite. This is the percussion section leader’s cue to signal the conclusion of
       the drum cadence. The solo tenor drummer then plays a drum tap to march the band
       to the gravesite. At the gravesite, the COT will give the command to Mark Time
       when the formation is in position followed by Halt and a facing movement of Left
       Face or Right Face to face the escort towards the grave. The Drum Major will then
       place the band at Parade Rest. If band members use lyred sheet music, they can
       change music during Parade Rest.
       10.6.1.3.7. Transfer of Remains to the Gravesite. Once the hearse or other vehicle
       arrives at the gravesite, the COT gives the escort Attention to prepare for the transfer
       of remains from the caisson to the grave. The band is given Horns Up when the
       casket bearers are ready to transfer the remains from the caisson to the grave.
       Following Present Arms, the band plays a hymn for the transfer of remains. If the
       hymn ends while the body bearers are still carrying the remains to the grave, the band
       leader may either signal the band to repeat the hymn or cue the tenor drummer to play
       a roll until the remains are placed on the grave. The band leader will cue the
       drummer to end the roll with the saluting hand. The band leader will give Horns
       Down if a roll is not performed. The COT gives a command for Order Arms after the
       transfer is complete and the hymn has ended. This may result in a Parade Rest from
       the COT if it is determined that Honors are rendered prior to the religious committal.
       If Honors are rendered first, there will be no Parade Rest. If this is the case, the
       bugler should leave the formation immediately to position him/herself for Taps.
       10.6.1.3.8. Honors. The chaplain salutes; this is the cue for the COT to give the
       escort Attention. The band leader and COT then salute, and the firing party fires
       volleys. The firing party’s commander will give Present Arms. This is the cue for
       the bugler to sound Taps. Once Taps is complete, the COT gives Order Arms. This
       command ends Honors.
       10.6.1.3.9. Completion of Ceremony. The band leader faces the band, gives Horns
       Up, and the band plays the Air Force Hymn while the casket bearers fold the flag that
       was draped over the remains. Once the Air Force Hymn is complete, the band leader
       gives the band Horns Down and faces the grave. When the flag is handed to the
       family, the body bearers leave the gravesite and march to the dispersal site. The COT
       gives a command to face the escort in the direction of the dispersal site. As the COT
       repositions with the guidon bearer at the top of the column, the Drum Major
       commands a drum tap. When the COT arrives at the top of the column, he faces the
       escort and commands Forward March, and the escort marches to the dispersal area.
       When the escort arrives at the dispersal site, the COT flanks off the formation and
       halts to give the escort Mark Time March. The COT commands Halt followed by a
       command for the escort to face the COT. The band leader repositions in front of the
       band. The COT gives Present Arms, Order Arms, Dismiss, and Retire the Colors.
       The COT tells the flight commanders, including the band leader, to take charge of
       their flights. If the COT is an officer, the Drum Major salutes before dismissing the
       band.
 158                                                        AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


   10.6.2. Modified Full Honors Funerals. For a modified Full Honors funeral, during which a
   band is not present, the tenor drummer serves in the capacity of the band while on the march.
   A bugler is present to sound Taps. The sequence of events is the same as a Full Honors
   service, except that in place of the hymns, the tenor drummer plays a drum roll. The tenor
   drummer plays a continuous drum cadence or drum tap on the march. The Air Force Hymn is
   not performed at the gravesite. The drummer takes all commands directly from the COT.
   10.6.3. General Officer Funeral. Only during a general officer's funeral, military Honors
   (including Ruffles and Flourishes and the General's March) precede the playing of a hymn
   for the transfer of the remains, either onto the caisson during a transfer service or into the
   chapel during a chapel service.
       10.6.3.1. Honors In Sequence. The OIC/NCOIC will say “Secure”. The personal colors
       are then uncased or unfurled. The body bearers take the remains from the hearse or
       vehicle. The OIC commands Present Arms and then salutes. If there is a casket, Honors
       are rendered after the casket is removed from the hearse. If the remains were cremated,
       Honors are rendered after two body bearers return to their formation with the remains and
       the U.S. Flag. Musical Honors and the appropriate number of Ruffles and Flourishes are
       rendered. The body bearers then step off as the band plays a hymn. The sequence
       continues as normal.
       10.6.3.2. Furling of Personal Colors. Once military Honors are completed at the
       gravesite, the COT commands Order Arms, and the personal colors bearer lowers the flag
       to horizontal. The personal colors bearer may need to reposition to be in line of sight of
       the family. The band leader cues a drum roll as the flag becomes horizontal. The flag is
       then furled and cased. As the flag comes back up to vertical (right shoulder), the roll
       either stops or fades into the Air Force Hymn if a band is present.
       10.6.3.3. The band may play Ruffles and Flourishes and General’s March with no hymn
       following Honors. A drum roll may be performed in place of a hymn.
   10.6.4. Standard Honors Funerals. Standard Honors funerals may include a color team,
   firing party, chaplain, body bearers, and bugler. The difference between a Standard Honors
   Funeral and a Full Honors Funeral is the number and make up of the flights in formation.
       10.6.4.1. Standard Honors Graveside Service.

           ceremony at the gravesite.
           10.6.4.1.2. Posting of Colors. The colors are posted 10 minutes prior to the arrival of
           the remains. The bugler will not be in the formation.
           10.6.4.1.3. Transfer of Remains to the Gravesite.
           10.6.4.1.4. Honors. The chaplain salutes; this is the cue for the COT to give the
           escort Attention. The drum major and COT then salute, and the firing party fires
           volleys. The firing party’s commander gives Present Arms. The firing party
           performs Present Arms. The bugler then sounds Taps. Once Taps is complete, the
           COT gives Order Arms. This command ends Honors.
           10.6.4.1.5. Completion of Ceremony. The bugler may leave with military bearing
           when the formation departs.
       10.6.4.2. If a bugler is unavailable due to mission requirements, an electronic bugle may
       be used to perform Honors.
10.7. Joint Service Ceremonies. Joint service arrivals follow the same format as arrivals but
may include a Pass In Review. Many parts of joint service reviews are similar to joint service
arrivals, but some parts of the ceremony function differently. For instance, for a joint service
arrival, the fanfare is for the arriving official, but in a Pass In Review, the fanfare is for the
reviewing official, often the local commander of the installation at which the Review is
performed.

   10.8.3. The Drum Major gives Forward March, and the band marches onto the parade route
   to a drum cadence.
   10.8.4. To signal the band to play, the Drum Major signals for a Roll-Off.
   10.8.5. At the end of the piece (or at any point in the music), the Drum Major gives a Seven-
   Count Cut Off. At the end of the Seven-Count Cut Off, the Drum Major gives Horns Down,
   and the drum cadence resumes. Throughout the duration of the parade, the Drum Major
   repeats the sequence of the following mace commands: Roll-Off, Horns Up, play a musical
   selection, Horns Down, and the drum cadence.

   10.8.6. Air Force bands play The Air Force Song while passing the reviewing stand. If a
   general officer or equivalent is present as a reviewing officer, render the appropriate number
   of Ruffles and Flourishes before playing The Air Force Song.

     Attention. NOTE: There is a high probability that there will be no line of sight to the
     hearse and the cordon.
     10.13.3.8. The family exits the vehicles and moves into position. The hearse is opened,
     and the body bearers move into position. The band officer performs a three-count about

     will perform Order Arms with the firing party.
     10.13.3.15. Upon completion of Order Arms, the band officer will command Parade
     Rest. The band should expect to be in this position for 20 to 30 minutes.
     10.13.3.16. Religious committal (benediction) is completed. The band liaison will cue
     Attention. The band officer will command the band to Attention. The band officer and
     the Drum Major will Present Arms using the firing party command. A Presidential
     battery will fire the 21-gun salute. After last gun volley, the band officer and the Drum

     Order Arms and a three-count about face to face the band and commands Horns Up.
 170                                                       AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


       10.13.3.18. During a flyover, the band liaison will cue to start a hymn. The Drum Major
       will relay the command to start a hymn to the band officer who will start the hymn
       Eternal Father.
       10.13.3.19. The band will perform hymn one time through (two verses). Upon
       completion of hymn, the band officer will bring Horns Down and perform a three-count
       about face.
       10.13.3.20. The ceremony is complete, and the family leaves. On cue from JFHQ, the
       band departs. The band will follow the Drum Major’s command or echo of Forward
       March. Once the band is sufficient distance away, the drum major gives the command to
       Halt and dismisses the band.
10.14. Different Authorized Instrumentation. A brass quintet, with or without drummer, may
substitute for a band if resources do not allow a full ceremonial band to be present. All
sequences remain the same, but some marches may need to be replaced by music better suited
for a small ensemble. A woodwind quintet may be used instead of a brass quintet in some
circumstances (indoor ceremonies only). As the occasion warrants, a vocalist may be used with
the brass quintet for the U.S. Anthem. Brass or woodwind quintets primarily perform seated, but
may be directed to stand for performance of Honors at the local commander’s discretion. In the
event that the quintet is directed to perform Honors standing, the concert tubbiest will still
remain seated. Quintet music for ceremonies may be obtained from The USAF Band,
Ceremonial Brass. (See Attachment 3.).

                                    CEREMONIAL MUSIC

11.1. Anthems.
   11.1.1. The U.S. Anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. The official Department of Defense
   version of the U.S. Anthem is the Bb version the says US Armed Forces Edition and is dated
   as May 1997. The version performed by The USAF Band, Ceremonial Brass, is also
   authorized (Werle arrangement, updated for Ceremonial Band by Villanueva-present on
   Ceremonial Sheet). Contact The USAF Band, Ceremonial Brass, for each version. The U.S.
   Anthem should be performed only while the colors are stationary. The U.S. Anthem is never
   used as a processional.
   11.1.2. Music is not required but may be used for the procession and retirement of the colors
   in a dignified manner. The trio to National Emblem is traditionally used in DOD and joint
   ceremonies. You’re a Grand Old Flag can be used in other ceremonial venues. A drum
   cadence or drum roll is also acceptable.
   11.1.3. Protocol Regarding Foreign Anthems. The Military District of Washington (MDW)
   determines the anthem precedence (other than the U.S. Anthem). When one or more foreign
   anthems and the U.S. Anthem are performed, the U.S. Anthem is performed last, except in
   conjunction with the moving of the colors. For questions regarding anthems, contact The
   USAF Band, Ceremonial Brass (See Attachment 3.)
11.2. Authorized Musical Tributes. One musical tribute is authorized during a ceremony,
regardless of the number of honorees. Choose from the following:
   11.2.1. An American Tribute
   11.2.2. God Bless the U.S.A.
   11.2.3. Wind Beneath My Wings
   11.2.4. America the Beautiful-arranged by Baker
   11.2.5. God Bless America-arranged by Baker
11.3. Bugle Calls. Bugle calls can be sounded on trumpets or cornets when bugles are not
available. A useful tool for sending communications over a long distance, they were once
important in everyday military life. Today most calls are used in ceremonial settings and at
times designated by installation commanders. Although troops are no longer maneuvered by the
sound of bugles, they remain an essential part of military heritage. Bugle calls are classified into
three categories: Warning Calls, Formation Calls, and Service Calls. Sounding bugle calls is an
important duty, and every effort should be made to sound perfect calls in keeping with the
occasion of a military ceremony. Calls should be sounded with conviction, played musically
with good intonation, and should be performed in place. Calls requiring a hand salute are noted
in this section.
   11.3.1. Assembly, Reveille, Retreat, Adjutant's Call, To the Color, Ruffles and Flourishes,
   and marches are sounded by multiple trumpeters (or buglers) together. Other calls, as a rule,
   are sounded by only one trumpeter (or bugler). If resources do not allow for a band to be
 172                                                        AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


   present, the bugler may play any bugle call as a solo. If resources do not allow for a bugler
   to be present for a Standard Honors Funeral, an electronic bugle may be used to perform
   Honors.
   11.3.2. Adjutant's Call (Formation Call) signals the adjutant to take his place in front of the
   formation before a ceremony. Most often, the Adjutant's Call is used before a March On to
   establish tempo. Troops will step off after Adjutant's Call on the downbeat of the following
   march.

Figure 11.1. Adjutant’s Call.




   11.3.3. Assembly (a Formation Call) is a call to assemble troops in formation.

Figure 11.2. Assembly.




   11.3.4. Attention (a Warning Call) is a short call to bring the troops to the position of
   Attention and to await further orders.

Figure 11.3. Attention.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                     173


   11.3.5. Call To Quarters (a Service Call) is sounded for everyone not on duty to be in their
   quarters preparing for the extinguishing of lights.

Figure 11.4. Call To Quarters.




   11.3.6. Church Call (a Service Call) is a signal that a religious service is about to begin. The
   call may also be used to announce the formation of a funeral escort.

Figure 11.5. Church Call.




   11.3.7. Drill (a Warning Call) is sounded to prepare for drill.

Figure 11.6. Drill Call.




   11.3.8. Fatigue (a Service or Warning Call) is sounded to prepare for work detail.
 174                                                        AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


Figure 11.7. Fatigue.




   11.3.9. First Call (a Warning Call) is a preparation call for those who are to participate in a
   formation or ceremony to get ready. It is also used as a signal for all buglers to assemble.

Figure 11.8. First Call.




   11.3.10. Flag Officer's March (a Service Call) is used to render Honors to a naval flag
   officer. Ruffles and Flourishes always precede the Flag Officer’s March. Though normally
   sounded by a band, a modified bugle call may be played if a band is not present. Military
   members render a hand salute.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                175


Figure 11.9. Flag Officer’s March.




   11.3.11. Flourish (Service Call) is a brief fanfare used to render Honors to a designated
   person. Flourishes are usually accompanied by Ruffles (a roll) on the drum (See Ruffles and
   Flourishes.). Military members render a hand salute.

Figure 11.10. Flourish (Ruffles and Flourishes).




   11.3.12. General's March (a Service Call) is used to render Honors to a general officer.
   Ruffles and Flourishes precede it. A solo bugler or band may play it. Military members
   render a hand salute.

Figure 11.11. General’s March.
 176                                                         AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


   11.3.13. Mess Call (a Warning or Service Call) is sounded to announce breakfast, lunch, and
   dinner.

Figure 11.12. Mess Call.




   11.3.14. Officer’s Call (a Service Call) is sounded to assemble officers at a designated area.

Figure 11.13. Officer’s Call.




   11.3.15. Recall (a Service Call) is sounded at times designated by the officer in charge. It
   signals that drill is over. It is also sounded to end an activity such as a work detail.

Figure 11.14. Recall.




   11.3.16. Retreat (a Service Call) marks the end of the official day. It is sounded no later
   than sundown. The Star-Spangled Banner follows retreat, and the flag is lowered as the
   anthem plays. If there is no band to play the U.S. Anthem and no recording is available, To
   The Color is sounded in its place. Military members stand at parade rest for retreat and at
   attention and saluting for the U.S. Anthem, facing the flag or music.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                      177


Figure 11.15. Retreat.




   11.3.17. Reveille (a Service Call) signals morning roll call.

Figure 11.16. Reveille.




   11.3.18. Ruffles and Flourishes (a Service Call) is a brief fanfare used in rendering Honors.
   The bugles sound the Flourishes, and the drums play the Ruffles. Flourishes may be
   substituted for Ruffles and Flourishes if drums are not present. The number of Ruffles and
   Flourishes played is identical to the number of stars in the rank of the general or flag officer.
   Ruffles and Flourishes are followed by the corresponding Honors march. Military members
   render a hand salute.
 178                                                         AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


Figure 11.17. Ruffles and Flourishes.




   11.3.19. Sound Off (a Service Call) is a prelude to the band’s “trooping of the line”
   movement during a parade or review. This tradition dates to the Crusades. The three notes
   or chords are the musical equivalent of “Three Cheers.” When no band is present, bugles
   may sound this call in place (stationary) followed by a short march for bugles. Then Sound
   Off is played again. The pitches for Sound Off are the first and fifth notes of the key and the
   march following Sound Off is played in (ex. Bb, F, Bb for a march written in Bb major.)

Figure 11.18. Sound Off.




   11.3.20. Tattoo (a Service Call) signals that all lights are to be extinguished one hour after
   the call is sounded and that all noises and loud talking is to cease. Tattoo dates from the 17th
   Century and was used to summon troops back to their garrison for the night roll call.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                               179


Figure 11.19. Tattoo.




   11.3.21. Taps (a Service Call) became associated with funerals during the Civil War. Taps
   is used today as the final evening call and as last Honors at military funerals. Taps is
   performed as a solo bugle call. “Echo Taps” or any variations of non-unison sounds are not
   authorized. Military members render a hand salute when Taps is used for last Honors.

Figure 11.20. Taps.
 180                                                      AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


   11.3.22. To the Color (a Service or Formation Call) is sounded as a salute to the National
   Colors, to the President of the United States, to the Vice-President, former Presidents and
   foreign chief magistrates. The call can be sounded in unison by one or several buglers. To
   The Color is sounded in place of The Star-Spangled Banner when a bugler is used in lieu of a
   live band or a taped recording. Military members render a hand salute and face the flag or
   face the direction of the music if the flag is not in view.

Figure 11.21. To the Color.




11.4. Cadences and Percussion Music.
   11.4.1. Normal march cadences, either in 4/4 or 6/8 time, are played at pulse of 112-116
   beats per minute.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                  181


Figure 11.22. 2/4 Drum Cadence.




Figure 11.23. 6/8 Drum Cadence.




   11.4.2. Funeral cadences are played slower than march tempo: 104-112 beats per minute.
 182                                                        AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


Figure 11.24. Funeral Cadence.




   11.4.3. Roll-Off is an eight-count percussion cadence to indicate that the band should bring
   instruments up and prepare to play. The drum major raises the mace by the shaft with the
   ball in the air, directly in front and perpendicular with the ground. This is the signal for a
   Roll-Off. When the drum major drops the mace and grabs it just below the ball, the Roll-Off
   begins. The band starts playing after the Roll-Off.

Figure 11.25. Funeral and Parade Roll-Offs.




   11.4.4. A drum tap is the simplest of drum cadences. One tenor/snare drummer, rather than
   the whole section, plays it; the drummer taps the drumhead with the drumstick to mark the
   stepping tempo in order to keep the troops marching in synchronization. Drum taps are used
   when quieter cadences are appropriate, such as on leaving the parade ground and marching to
   the dispersing area.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                183


   11.4.5. A stick tap is a quieter substitute for a drum tap. One tenor/snare drummer plays a
   stick tap.
   11.4.6. Muffled Ruffles are played only during wreath laying ceremonies. A solo tenor
   drum performs Muffled Ruffles. The roll used is a buzz roll or closed roll.

Figure 11.26. Muffled Ruffles.




   11.4.7. Seven-Count Cut Off is an aural cue to the band to cease playing.

Figure 11.27. Seven-Count Cut Off.




11.5. Funeral Music.
   11.5.1. Hymns. All hymns should be recognizable, standard traditional hymns.
      11.5.1.1. The Air Force Hymn, also called Lord Guard and Guide, is played at all Air
      Force Full Honors Funerals when a band is present. It is played after Order Arms
      following the sounding of Taps.

Terms
Alignment—. Alignment refers to the proper ordering of personnel to create straight files and
ranks with each member facing the proper direction with the appropriate distance, interval, and
facing between members, including dress and cover.
At Ease—. The command is “At EASE”. This command is given to the band only while in the
position of Attention. The band may relax but must keep the right foot in place. The position of
the formation does not change nor does the position of each member. Speaking is not authorized
while At Ease.
Attention-- The command is “Tench HUT”. In this position, heels are together, toes are apart to
create a 30-degree angle with the feet, legs are straight but not stiff, the back is straight,
shoulders are rolled slightly back, the head is level with the ground, the eyes are looking directly
forward, and the proper military bearing is maintained. To come to Attention, bring the feet
together smartly and on line, the left foot moving to meet the right. Keep the legs straight
without stiffening or locking the knees. The body is erect with hips level, chest lifted and
shoulders squared and even. Arms that are not holding instruments hang straight down alongside
the body. The wrists are not bent. Place the thumbs, which are resting along the joint of the
forefinger, along the seams of the trousers. Hands are cupped, but not clenched in a fist, with
palms facing the leg. The head is erect and parallel with the ground. The neck is vertical with
the body. The eyes are facing directly forward with the line of sight parallel with the ground.
No movement, talking or other vocalization is authorized at the position of Attention.
Baldric—. A Baldric is an ornamental sash worn over the left shoulder by the Drum Major.
Military awards and decorations earned by the band are displayed on the baldric. Drum Majors
also carry a mace when wearing the baldric.
Cadence—. Cadence has several definitions:
1. The uniform step and rhythm in marching and the pulse by which the troops stay in step.
2. The number of steps marched per minute.
3. The repetitive music played by the percussion section on the march. A drum tap or stick tap
may substitute for a cadence when necessary.
Column-- A column is the file, or files, of band members from front to back when facing
forward or the position of the formation when in column march. A column can be a group of
files or simply one file.
Cover-- Individuals aligning themselves directly behind the person to their immediate front
while maintaining proper distance. The front most rank has no cover responsibility but
establishes interval. Cover is also used after the command “Dress Center/Right/Left”.
Countermarch-- A countermarch is a drill that positions the band facing the opposite direction.
 188                                                           AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014


Dismissed-- The command is “DISMISSED”. Airmen break ranks from a formation and
leave the area. (See AFMAN 36—2203, paragraph 4.3.5.).
Distance-- The space between band members. The band's distance from front to back is
two paces, two 30—inch steps, or 60 inches.
Dress—. Alignment of elements side by side or in line maintaining proper interval. Each
member must be positioned so that the shoulders are parallel with the rank and perpendicular
with the file. The verb is the act of positioning one's self directly beside another band member.
The far left (or far right) file has no dress responsibility, depending on which way the band is
dressing as they are the dress file.
Drum Major—. The Drum Major is the band member that conducts and leads the band on
ceremonies, parades, and many other events. The Drum Major wears a baldric and carries a
mace. The Drum Major is responsible for the band's drill and formation as well as the band's
musical performance when a band officer is not present.
Facing—. The relative direction of the band or members of the band.
Fall In—. The command is “FALL IN”. The band will form up as designated by the Drum
Major. Each band member will come to the position of Attention once in formation.
Fall Out—. The command is “FALL OUT”. On the command “FALL OUT”, individuals may
relax in a standing position or break ranks. They must remain in the immediate area, but no
specific method of dispersal is required. Moderate speech is permitted.
File—. A single column of persons placed one behind the other.
Flanking Movement—. A drill movement in which a band member or the band as a whole
immediately faces left or right while continuing to march. Pivot on the ball of the foot opposite
the flank direction while the leading foot steps in the new direction of travel performs a Flank.
1. Left Flank—. The command is “Left Flank MARCH”. The command is given on the left
foot during the march. On a left flank, the band member will pivot on the ball of the right foot
on the first count of the direction change. The left foot will take one step 90 degrees to the left of
the direction of travel on the first step of the flank as the right foot pivots.
2. Right Flank—. The command is “Right Flank MARCH”. The command is given on the
right foot during the march. On a right flank, the band member will pivot on the ball of the left
foot on the first count of the direction change. The right foot will take one step 90 degrees to the
right of the direction of travel on the first step of the flank as the left foot pivots.
Formation—. An arrangement of band members positioned in a predetermined grouping for a
ceremony. Each ceremony determines what formation is to be used. The Drum Major will be in
the front of the formation to give it instruction and musical direction.
Half Step— A 15inch step that maintains the style of the roll step. This is normally used
coming out of a turn and in a countermarch.
Honors—. Military honors are rendered to any person who has served in the armed forces,
including the Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. Honors are also rendered for
domestic and foreign government officials equivalent to the rank of general officer or civilian
equivalent or above. Military honors can include Ruffles and Flourishes, General's March, or
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                         189


other certain marches as prescribed by the DOD (see Chapter 12). Military honors for deceased
veterans include a firing party rendering three volleys and a bugler sounding Taps.
Interval-- The space between individuals placed side by side, most often measured in steps. For
instance, the band is usually spaced at a two—step interval, based on a 30-inch step.
Mace—. The mace is the ceremonial baton carried by the Drum Major. It is a metal or wooden
shaft with a sphere on top. It usually contains the image or title of the organization and other
ornamentation. The mace is used to guard the colors on the baldric. This is in keeping with the
Flag Code of the United States (colors must be guarded). The mace is also used to give visual
commands to the band for drill and musical instruction. The parts of the mace are the ball, the
sphere at the top of the mace, the staff, the chain around the staff and the ferrule, which is the
metal covering around the base of the mace. The Drum Major is considered to be under arms
when holding the mace.
Mark Time March-- The command is “Mark Time MARCH”. This command may be given
from Forward March or Halt. From a Halt, the first two counts of the mark time motion should
bring the toes into a position pointing in the direction of travel with toes and heels being directly
adjacent to one another. The left foot is lifted first with the heel of the left foot reaching parallel
to the center of the ankle bone of the right leg and the toes staying as close to the ground as
possible. From a Forward March or after the first two counts of mark time from a Halt, the toes
should remain on the ground with the heel striking the ground comfortably and without shock at
each cadence pulse. The knee will break naturally and extend beyond the plane of the opposite
leg. The upper body maintains the position of Attention. The knee bend and heel height should
be consistent for all counts of the mark time. Members should not lean toward the lifted foot to
maintain balance (Figures 3.10. and 3.11.). The upper body should remain steady at the position
of Attention during Mark Time March. Dig into the ground with each big toe to prevent leaning
if necessary. Each foot should remain pointed straight forward without turnout when on the
ground during Mark Time March. At the command of Halt, the feet resume their 30-degree
angle in the position of Attention (see Halt).
Oblique—. Also called Column Half Left and Column Half Right. An Oblique is a drill
movement that is done while marching. The band member pivots on the ball of the foot opposite
the oblique direction to continue marching 45 degrees off the plane of the previous direction.
This is most often used with column turns.
Pace-- The pace is the distance between each step, also called step size. The band will take the
common 24—inch step, used throughout the Air Force. The Drum Major may use a 30-inch step
to set the 60-inch intervals between band members, allowing for less dense formations and more
space between players. The 30-inch step is also called a “6 to 5” since 6 steps equal 5 yards.
While intervals between band members are based on the larger 30-inch step size, it is important
to note the standard pace that a band should move at is a 24-inch step.
Parade Rest-- The command is “Parade REST”. This command is given from the position of
Attention. The left foot moves to the left so that the feet are shoulder width apart. The feet will
be slightly turned out, maintaining a 30-degree angle. The legs are straight but not stiff. The
heels are in line. Each player will move the instrument to a different position or move the hands
on the instruments (see Chapter 5). No movement is authorized at the position of Parade Rest.
No talking or other vocalization is authorized at the position of Parade Rest. The upper body,
other than the arms, maintains the position of Attention.

Rank—. A single line of persons placed side by side.
Rest—. The command is “REST”. On the command “REST”, the same requirements for At
Ease apply, but moderate speech is permitted.
Roll—Off-- An eight-count percussion cadence to indicate that the band should bring
instruments up and prepare to play at the end of the eight counts. To indicate a Roll-Off, the
Drum Major will lift the mace in the air vertically. The Roll-Off begins when the mace is raised.
Roll Step-- The roll step is the style of marching in use throughout the Air Force. The left foot
steps first with the heel hitting on the cadence pulse and the foot rolling through to the toe. The
step size is 24 inches. The band member must take care that the first and last steps are 24 inches.
As the knees move in a forward motion and the upper body maintains the position of Attention,
the weight of the body should be centered between the feet on each step. The sternum should be
lifted and forward to maintain posture. The toes will be pointed forward with no turn out. The
band member will roll through the middle of the foot, not the outside. The feet will move side—
by-side like a cross-country skier, not place one in front of the other like a tight rope walker.
There should be as little upper body movement as possible for ease in playing an instrument.
Route Step—. A walking step without cadence. Commonly used with column of files
movements. The upper body maintains the position of Attention.
Seven—Count Cut Off. A seven-count percussion cadence used to indicate that the band is to
stop playing. The last note played by the band is the seventh count of the Seven-Count Cut Off.
This can happen at any point in the music.
Side Step—. A side step is a drill maneuver that allows the band to move to the right or left
without changing direction.
1. Side Step Left. The command is “Left Step MARCH”. This command may only be given
from Halt. On the command of execution, "MARCH," the band member lifts the left foot high
enough to allow freedom of movement. Keep the leg straight but not stiff. Place the left foot 12
inches to the left of where it began in the position of Attention. The left foot will still maintain a
15-degree turnout as it did in the position of Attention. This foot lift and 12-inch move should
be a smooth motion. Lift the right leg and bring it 12 inches to the left to meet the left leg. End
the step with the heels touching and the toes open at 30 degrees at the position of Attention.
Continue to Side Step Left until the command Halt is given. On the command Halt, take one
more Side Step Left and close in the position of Attention.
2. Side Step Right. The command is “Right Step MARCH”. This command may only be given
from Halt. On the command of execution, "MARCH," the band member lifts the right foot high
enough to allow freedom of movement. Keep the leg straight but not stiff. Place the right foot
12 inches to the right of where it began in the position of Attention. The right foot will still
maintain a 15-degree turnout as it did in the position of Attention. This foot lift and the 12-inch
move should be a smooth motion. Lift the left leg and bring it 12 inches to the right to meet the
right leg. End the step with the heels touching and the toes open at 30 degrees at the position of
Attention. Continue to Side Step Right until the command Halt is given. On the command Halt,
take one more Side Step Right and close in the position of Attention. This is the only drill
command, other than Column Right, that begins with the right foot.
AFMAN35-106 12 AUGUST 2014                                                                      191


Stand By—. The Drum Major will give the command “STAND BY” from the position of At
Ease. The band will go to the position of Parade Rest. This command lets the band know that
further commands are to follow.
Step Size-- The step size is the distance between each step, also called pace. The band will use
a 24-inch step, which is used throughout the Air Force. The Drum Major may use a 30-inch step
to set the 60-inch intervals between band members, allowing for less dense formations and more
space between players. The 30-inch step is also called a “6 to 5”, as six steps equal five yards.
While intervals between band members are based on the larger 30-inch step size, it is important
to note the standard pace that a band should use is a 24-inch step.
Stinger—. A stinger is the last, extra note at the end of a march. Some ceremonies have
marches in which the stinger will not be played, such as Hands Across the Sea and Stars and
Stripes Forever. Stingers are not used in marches rendering military honors. These marches are
called honors marches.
Three-Count About Face-- There is no command for this movement. This movement is only
performed while moving as a solitary member and from the position of Attention. Lift the left
foot just enough to clear the ground and place it in front (perpendicular) of the right foot forming
a "T" with both feet, bend the knees slightly. This is the first count of the movement. In the
second count, the position of the left foot is not changed; lift the right foot just high enough to
clear the ground and pivot 180 degrees, bring the heels together to form a 90-degree angle (an
"L"), then bring the left foot smartly to the right foot (third count), resuming the position of
Attention. Keep the arms pinned at the side for the entire movement. Head and eyes follow the
lead/moving foot on each count.
Turn—. A drill sequence used to move the band in a different direction, either to the right or
left. For drill sequences used to face the band in the opposite direction, see countermarch. Each
type of turn involves a mace command (see Chapter 8).
1. Square Turn—. A Square Turn is a turn in which each file performs a flanking movement
with each member of the file performing a flank two steps after the person in front of them.
2. Column Turn—. A Column Turn is a turn in which the files of the band perform a flank
(square turn) for the interior file and two obliques for all other files to change direction to the
right or left while marching.
3. Wheel Turn-- A Wheel Turn is a turn where band members move in an arc to change
direction of the band. Band members maintain their side-to-side alignment as they do the turn.
Band members on the interior of the turn must adjust their step size to a smaller step to
accommodate the larger arc being formed by the exterior arcs. The exterior members should
maintain a 24-inch step. The step size of each progressively interior file will decrease from the
exterior file's 24-inch step so that the ranks resemble spokes of a wheel as they make the turn.
The dress on a wheel turn is to the outside of the turn.

   than once throughout a ceremony. Substitution of the U.S. Anthem for Hail to the Chief may
   only occur at White House Arrivals and State Funeral Arrival and Departure ceremonies.
   A2.3.3. Hail to the Chief may be played when specifically requested by the President, the
   Secretary of State, the Chief of the Secret Service, or their authorized representative. Four

Across The Sea with repeat but without a pickup note or stinger.
A2.7. Appropriate background music is any music such as a national air or folk song favorably
associated with the distinguished person. If no such music is known or available, any music of
universal appeal and propriety may be used. All music performed as background music should
be appropriately subdued to the principal action.
A2.8. Appropriate inspection music may be in any meter, and the inspection cadence is not
required to conform to the musical cadence.
