        2.6.1.4. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the
        supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career
        knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201, and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all
        mandatory items specified within the Enlisted Classification Directory. For
        two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action
        IAW AFI 36-2201. NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to
        submitting a CDC waiver.

        2.6.1.5. Decertification and Desertification. Once verified that an Airman is
        unqualified on a task, the supervisor must erase previous certification date and enter the
        Airman into qualification training. The reason for decertification is annotated on
        the AF Form 623a (On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet). After the
        trainee demonstrates competence, use the normal certification process to recertify the
        individual.

  2.7. The STS also serves as a development guide for promotion tests used in the Weighted
  Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in
  their career fields develop specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) at the USAF Occupational
  Measurement Squadron. The objective of these tests is to sample one’s STS knowledge.
  Working off this premise, the test development team unanimously determined the appropriate
  subject matter areas for promotion to higher grades. Note: Test questions stem from study
  references listed in the WAPS catalog. WAPS individual responsibilities are in chapter one
  of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to
  the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.
