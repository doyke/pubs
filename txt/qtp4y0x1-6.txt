Introduction _________________________________________________i

        Volume 6, Logistics Management, Qualification Training Package (QTP) contains
modules on maintaining logistics documentation, procedures for maintaining logistics
publications, requesting supplies and equipment, managing stock levels, and storing of
materials. This QTP is designed to enhance 5-, and 7-skill level OJT of dental assistant
personnel. All eight volumes are intended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and
task certifiers. Before initiating any training you should review your responsibilities--as a
supervisor/trainer--for conducting on-the-job training (OJT) per AFI 36-2201, Air Force
Training Program.

        QTPs are designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training. Once you
begin upgrade training you’re required to use the QTP. QTPs provide continuity to the
trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes: 1) Basic Skills; 2)
Clinical Skills - Radiology; 3) Clinical Skills - Chairside Assisting; 4) Clinical Skills -
Preventive Dentistry; 5) Patient Administration – Procedures and Programs; 6) Logistics
Management; 7) Clinic Management, and 8) Supervision and Training. The QTP modules
were written to assist you in preparing for and conducting training. You must use the QTP
modules for training when either: 1) the STS task is a core task (minimum qualification for
the specialty); or 2) you have identified the STS task as a requirement of the trainee’s job.
Each module segments the major tasks into teachable elements. Your goal is to provide
enough training and guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without assistance,
while meeting local requirements for speed and accuracy. QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers
in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance. If you have local training
requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in performance” and
“performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.

        Accompanying each volume of QTPs is a qualification training progress record.
This QTP record serves as a document to record the date the trainee completes each
module. Individuals in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP progress record
filed in their OJT folder. Use and annotation of this progress record are similar to current
OJT documentation. When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as prescribed in
the QTP performance checklist, you must document and initial each task completion date in
column 2B of the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and the “date completed” column in
the QTP progress record. If a person is being recertified on a task that is supported by a
QTP you must use that module to complete the recertification process.

        Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then,
evaluating performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed
in the QTP module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half
of each module, (i.e., steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is
considered a standard and cannot be altered. You may train each QTP volume/module in
any sequence; however, when conducting training use an organized and methodical
approach. This will reduce your training time and enhance your efforts.
Introduction ________________________________________________ii

         When beginning any training process you should first, review the procedures in
each module with the trainee. Second, direct the trainee to review the training references
listed to prepare for task performance. Third, go through the steps in task performance with
the trainee, allowing enough time to adequately train each step (some modules may take
longer to teach). Fourth, evaluate the trainees work at each critical step--using the
performance checklist at this point will be helpful. Fifth, evaluate the trainee’s
performance and provide feedback on any areas for improvement. Finally, when the trainee
has successfully completed the task you must document and initial both the STS and the
QTP progress record. If the trainee does not accomplish the module, conduct follow-up
instruction until the trainee successfully completes the task.

        The QTP project goal of the 381 TRS/XWAA, Sheppard AFB TX, is to publish a
useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to write-in changes or
revisions to the QTPs. A corrections/improvements letter is located on the last page of each
QTP volume.

          The inclusion of names of any specific commercial product, commodity, or
service in this publication is for informational purposes only and does not imply
endorsement by the Air Force.
