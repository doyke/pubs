SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include:
clarification of and changes to local procedures, organizational name changes, and job responsibilities to
meet mission requirements. This is the initial publication of MACDILLAFBI 10-202, which revises and
replaces MACDILLAFBI 10-201, Recall Procedures (PA).


1. Concept of Operations. 6 AMW/CC or designated representative will direct recall of MacDill AFB
personnel as required. Unit recalls can be initiated as required by the appropriate subordinate command-
ers.

2. Definitions.
    2.1. Recall. Direction given to personnel to report to a specified duty section. Personnel will assume
    a requirement to report as soon as possible unless given other instructions. When reporting as soon as
    possible, individuals will report without delay (if at home, don a duty uniform and do not delay to
    shower, shave, etc.).
    2.2. Crisis Action Team (CAT). There are three types of CAT activations available to the commander.
       2.2.1. Basic CAT Activation. The activation of the 6AMW Commander, Vice Commander, Group
       Commanders, Director of Staff (DS), and Command Chief Master Sergeant or their designated
       representatives.
       2.2.2. Primary CAT Activation. The activation of Basic CAT members along with the other repre-
       sentatives as defined in the 6 AMW CAT Plan. Members will be notified via the current 6 AMW
       Recall Roster as outlined in Attachment 6.
       2.2.3. Expanded CAT Activation. The activation of all Primary CAT members along with the
       members of the Expanded CAT as defined in the 6 AMW CAT Plan. Members will be notified via
       the current 6 AMW Recall Roster as outlined in Attachment 6.
    2.3. Recall. There are nine types of Recall Responses available to the commander.
       2.3.1. Recall Response 1: All wing personnel recalled with Individual Protective Equipment (IPE)
       and mobility bags (if issued).
       2.3.2. Recall Response 2: All wing personnel recalled without IPE and mobility bags (if issued).
       2.3.3. Recall Response 3: CAT and Disaster Control Group (DCG).
       2.3.4. Recall Response 4: Telephone Standby.
       2.3.5. Recall Response 5: Mission essential personnel required for generation.
       2.3.6. Recall Response 6: Mission essential personnel required for deployment.
       2.3.7. Recall Response 7: Mission essential hurricane evacuation (HUREVAC) personnel.
       2.3.8. Recall Response 8: Necessary augmentee personnel.

       2.3.9. Recall Response 9: Test of the Wing recall system.
   2.4. Recall Options. There are four Recall Options available under the Recall Responses.
       2.4.1. Option A: Activate Commanders Support Staff (CSS), Unit Control Centers (UCC), and
       Group Control Centers (GCC) with Accountability Directed.
       2.4.2. Option B: Activate CSS, UCCs, and GCCs with Accountability NOT Directed.
       2.4.3. Option C: Accountability NOT Directed.
       2.4.4. Option D: Activate DCG.
   2.5. R-hour. The designated starting time of a recall for measuring higher headquarters timing. It
   begins when the initiating commander issues the recall order.
   2.6. Total Assigned. The total number of personnel assigned to the organization.
   2.7. Accounted For. Individuals with positively established whereabouts through personal contact
   with the individual or by reference to official records such as leave forms, temporary duty (TDY)
   orders, or equivalent.
   2.8. Present For Duty. Unit personnel physically present at their duty section.
   2.9. Total Available for Duty. All assigned personnel that can be recalled to their duty sections includ-
   ing those on Continental United States (CONUS) leave or TDY. For exercises, those on leave, TDY,
   or otherwise officially detained or excused may be excluded by direction of the recalling commander.
   2.10. Percent Present or Accounted For. Percentage of total present or accounted for compared to
   total available for duty.

3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. Commanders will appoint a recall monitor who will be responsible for consolidating strength
   data and reporting it as outlined in paragraph 5. Commanders will ensure their respective GCCs/UCCs
   are staffed and trained to implement recall procedures accurately and in a timely manner.
       3.1.1. Commanders will ensure unit members understand the importance of safeguarding their
       recall rosters as critical information (CI) and of properly destroying obsolete rosters. Recall rosters
       are not to be used as social rosters. Guidance for social rosters is available in AFI 33-332, para-
       graph 12.1.1.
       3.1.2. Commanders will develop procedures to recall and/or relay information to assigned mis-
       sion partners as outlined in Attachment 2 and any other on or off base agency with which they
       have significant support agreements. When the decision is made to include mission partners in a
       recall, the tasked group responsible for notifying the mission partner will contact them and relay
       instructions as received from the Command Post (6 AMW/CP) or CAT.
   3.2. GCCs/UCCs are primarily responsible for implementing recall procedures, accounting for all
   required personnel, and reporting. It is highly advantageous that GCCs/UCCs activate as soon as pos-
   sible in preparation for deployment operations to ensure accurate accounting and reporting of person-
   nel.
   3.3. Unit Recall Coordinators will:
4                                                        MACDILLAFBI10-202 15 FEBRUARY 2008


       3.3.1. Establish internal recall procedures and develop telephone and degraded communication
       recall rosters. Recall rosters are to be reviewed monthly for accuracy and a copy sent to the Com-
       mand Post not later than the 5th day of the month. Rosters must be labeled with a caveat to advise
       individuals that “This Roster Contains Personal Information and Is for Official Use Only.” Use a
       Privacy Act Statement on all personnel rosters as prescribed in DoDR 5400.7/Air Force Supple-
       ment, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program. Rosters will be destroyed when obsolete (i.e.,
       burning, shredding). Destroy electronic records by any means that ensures unauthorized transmis-
       sion or duplication. Unlisted telephone numbers must be listed on the roster with the annotation
       “unlisted” or “UL.” Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), military and civilian person-
       nel may exclude unlisted numbers from the printed roster; however, all members should be
       encouraged to include their information to ensure mission accomplishment. Units must ensure
       each member has a copy of the recall roster and one is maintained in the unit’s command section.
       3.3.2. Ensure recall rosters include key civilian personnel and IMA. IMAs and civilians do not
       have to be recalled for alert notification tests and exercises unless essential to the unit’s mission.
       Recall rosters can be annotated so these individuals are not recalled for exercises or notification
       tests.
    3.4. The 6th Civil Engineer Squadron Readiness Flight (6 CES/CEX), will provide training for GCC/
    UCC personnel (see AFI 10-2501, Emergency Management (EM) Planning and Operations, (Table
    6.3.)).
    3.5. The Command Post will maintain a list of Primary CAT members with alternates. This list will
    include current addresses and telephone numbers and will be verified on a monthly basis.
       3.5.1. Primary CAT members will immediately inform the Command Post any time their contact
       information changes or when another individual relieves them of their CAT duties.
    3.6. Expanded CAT mission partners will assign one suitable representative able to relay pertinent
    information to their command staff and speak for their commanders in the CAT.

MACDILLAFBI10-202 15 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                     5


     members will report a minimum of 10 minutes prior to the scheduled briefing time to review
     applicable messages and recall additional personnel as needed.
     4.2.4. Basic CAT should form ASAP, but no later than 1 hour from CC direction or at the sched-
     uled briefing time.
  4.3. Primary CAT Activation:
     4.3.1. 6 AMW/CC or designated representative directs the Command Post to implement a Pri-
     mary CAT Activation.
     4.3.2. Command Post will notify the Primary CAT members listed in the 6 AMW CAT Plan and

     COM, JCSE, NOAA, and JCSS.
     4.4.3. Expanded CAT members will normally be recalled to the Command Post, Building 54. If
     another location is selected, members will be notified at the time of the recall. When possible,
     members will report a minimum of 10 minutes prior to the scheduled briefing time to review
     applicable messages and recall additional personnel as needed.
     4.4.4. Expanded CAT members will respond ASAP but no later than 1.5 hours from CC direction
     or scheduled briefing time and will recess periodically to pass pertinent information.
  4.5. Recall Response Procedures:
     4.5.1. All units will initiate their pyramid recall procedures and CAT members will report to the
     Command Post as soon as possible or as directed.
     4.5.2. Each contacted individual will:
         4.5.2.1. Initiate their portion of the telephone pyramid as detailed in their unit recall proce-
         dures. Contact will be made directly with each individual required to be recalled. Messages
         left with other people or on answering machines are not sufficient for recall purposes. Infor-
         mation on the mission tasking will not be relayed; only reporting instructions will be dis-
         cussed. If an individual cannot be reached, contact the personnel the absent individual would
         normally call. Do not delay your response to continue attempts to contact unaccounted for per-
         sonnel. Advise your UCC of personnel that could not be reached in the pyramid. The UCC or
         designated representative will continue to attempt contact with all people that were not con-
         tacted with the initial pyramid recall.
6                                                        MACDILLAFBI10-202 15 FEBRUARY 2008


          4.5.2.2. Report to their normal duty station unless directed otherwise. Dress is the utility uni-
          form/battle dress uniform/Airman Battle Uniform (clothing as required for mission-essential
          civilian personnel). During incidents where immediate response of emergency personnel is
          required, the duty uniform requirement may be waived by the unit for those personnel not at
          home when notified of the recall. In these cases, the unit will arrange for personnel to change
          into the duty uniform as soon as the situation allows. Attached crew members will remain at
          their normal duty station unless the Commander, 6th Operations Group (6 OG/CC), declares
          the need for all crew members to report in. The attached crew members will then notify their
          respective UCC and report as requested.
       4.5.3. UCCs will make every attempt to make personal contact with all required unit personnel
       not contacted with the pyramid recall. If telephone contact cannot be made, the unit commander
       should consider the needs of the mission before sending runners to search for unaccounted for per-
       sonnel.
    4.6. Degraded Communication:
       4.6.1. Degraded Communication recall procedures will be implemented if a recall is necessary but
       normal communications procedures are not available.
       4.6.2. If runners are required, Command Post will direct the 6th Security Forces Squadron (6 SFS)
       to contact the wing commander and inform them of the situation. The runner will then return to the
       Command Post and relay any instructions received from the 6 AMW/CC.
       4.6.3. As directed by the 6 AMW/CC, the Command Post will provide addresses to and direct the
       SFS to dispatch patrols to the following senior officers’ on-base residences:
          4.6.3.1. 6th Air Mobility Wing Vice Commander (6 AMW/CV);
          4.6.3.2. 6th Operations Group Commander (6 OG/CC);
          4.6.3.3. 6th Maintenance Group Commander (6 MXG/CC);
          4.6.3.4. 6th Mission Support Group Commander (6 MSG/CC);
          4.6.3.5. 6th Medical Group Commander (6 MDG/CC);
          4.6.3.6. 6th Air Mobility Wing Command Chief (6 AMW/CCC).
       4.6.4. On Base: Command Post will notify the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC) to dispatch
       sound equipped security forces vehicles to common use, base dormitory, and housing areas. Addi-
       tionally, the Command Post will utilize Base Public Address System (Giant Voice), Land Mobile
       Radio network, and the Commander’s television channel as necessary.
       4.6.5. Off Base: With the approval of 6 AMW/CC, the Command Post will notify Public Affairs
       (6 AMW/PA) who will request local television and radio media announce the recall of MacDill
       AFB personnel.
       4.6.6. When contacted, individuals will initiate their portion of the unit’s Degraded Communica-
       tion notifications, then report to duty. A Degraded Communication recall involves individuals
       walking or driving to the next individual’s residence to pass the recall instructions. If an individual
       cannot be reached, contact the personnel the absent individual would normally contact. Advise
       your UCC of personnel that could not be reached.
MACDILLAFBI10-202 15 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                        7


         4.6.6.1. Unit Degraded Communication recall procedures should be organized by geographic
         locale to the maximum extent possible to minimize the amount of time and distance between
         successive contacts. Units should utilize maps or detailed instructions to assist in locating indi-
         viduals’ homes.
         4.6.6.2. UCCs will make every attempt to make contact with all unit personnel. If contact can-
         not be made, the unit commander should consider the needs of the mission before sending run-
         ners to search for unaccounted for personnel.
  4.7. Recall Response 1:
     4.7.1. Upon a Recall Response 1, ensure all personnel on mobility status report to work with their
     IPE and mobility bag for processing.
  4.8. Telephone Standby (Recall Response 4):
     4.8.1. Units will complete their pyramid alert notifications and remain on telephone standby. If
     the UCCs and GCCs are formed, the groups will report recall status in accordance with paragraph
     5. of this instruction.
     4.8.2. Required personnel will remain available for contact by telephone to receive further
     instructions. Individuals will ensure their telephone is maintained in working order and be able to
     answer without delay. If an individual’s telephone is inoperative or they need to be away from
     their telephone, they will contact their chain of command and inform them of their whereabouts.
  4.9. Mission Essential Generation Personnel (Recall Response 5):
     4.9.1. This option gives the commander the ability to tailor personnel mustered for aircraft gener-
     ation while minimizing the disruption of other base functions. This option assumes some time to
     prepare and organize forces prior to execution of the recall. Preparations may be initiated with a
     Recall Response or deliberate planning.
     4.9.2. The Command Post will contact the vice commander, group commanders, and 6 AMW/DS
     by secure means if necessary and relay information on the mission being directed and any other
     guidance from the 6 AMW/CC. Upon receiving notification, all group CCs and the 6 AMW/DS
     will initiate their recall and CAT members will report to the Command Post as soon as possible or
     as otherwise directed.
     4.9.3. Commanders will use available time prior to execution of the selective recall to prepare for
     anticipated mission sets to include setting shift schedules, assigning aircrew to appropriate alert
     posture, or crew rest.
     4.9.4. Selected individuals, except those in crew rest, will be personally notified of the selective
     recall. Recalled personnel will immediately report to their duty sections. Personnel assigned to a
     shift later in the day will remain on telephone standby and report for their shift as previously
     directed.
     4.9.5. Individuals in crew rest will remain in crew rest until alerted. Once alerted, aircrew
     assigned to mobility should report with mobility gear. Air traffic controllers and other personnel in
     crew rest will report for their designated shift.
  4.10. Mission Essential Deployment Personnel (Recall Response 6):
8                                                       MACDILLAFBI10-202 15 FEBRUARY 2008


       4.10.1. This option gives the commander the ability to tailor personnel mustered for deployment
       while minimizing the disruption of other base functions. Individuals required for the deployment
       process (UDMs and IDO) will report as directed. Preparations may be initiated with a Recall
       Response or deliberate planning.
       4.10.2. The Command Post will contact the vice commander, group commanders, and 6 AMW/
       DS by secure means if necessary and relay information on the mission being directed and any
       other guidance from the 6 AMW/CC. Upon receiving notification, all group CCs and the 6 AMW/
       DS will initiate their recall and CAT members will report to the Command Post as soon as possible
       or as otherwise directed.
       4.10.3. Commanders will use available time to determine deployment needs, prepare for antici-
       pated mission sets to include setting shift schedules, and assigning personnel.
    4.11. Necessary Augmentee Personnel (Recall Response 8):
       4.11.1. Only the 6 AMW/CC or 6 AMW/CV has the authority to activate augmentees.
       4.11.2. Recall will be accomplished through the applicable chains of command per MACDIL-
       LAFBI 10-243, Augmentation Duty Program.
       4.11.3. There are six groups of Augmentees that may be recalled.
           4.11.3.1. Air Passenger Function;
           4.11.3.2. Cargo Deployment Function;
           4.11.3.3. Deployment Vehicle Operations;
           4.11.3.4. Security Forces;
           4.11.3.5. Readiness Support Team;
           4.11.3.6. Search and Recovery.
       4.11.4. The 6 MSG/CC or Deputy Commander (6 MSG/CD) may request activation of 6 SFS aug-
       mentees.
       4.11.5. Contacted augmentees will report to their assigned unit and sign in for accountability and
       then immediately report to their augmentation duty sections.
    4.12. Test of the Wing Recall System (Recall Response 9):
       4.12.1. Status reports are not required nor will the Augmentee program be implemented.
       4.12.2. This test is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the recall system, but personnel are
       not required to report to their duty stations.
       4.12.3. Called units will record the time the communications test is completed (last person con-
       tacted) and report the results back to their group recall monitor, who will telephonically report the
       results to the UCCs and GCCs. If UCCs and GCCs are not activated, the results will be relayed to
       the Command Post. This information will be provided no later than close of business the first duty
       day following the test or as directed.

5. Reporting Accountability.
MACDILLAFBI10-202 15 FEBRUARY 2008                                                                       9


  5.1. UCCs will report their manning strength to their applicable GCC as required through Option A.
  GCCs will report for their unit’s statistics directly to the Commander’s Support Staff (CSS) located in
  the Command Post. Wing staff agencies will report unit manning strength information through the
  Director of Staff GCC or their own UCC. This information will be reported initially when the UCC is
  manned and a minimum of every hour until 100 percent of the unit and group is accounted for.
     5.1.1. Personnel already at their duty sections or in crew rest are considered accounted for. Per-
     sonnel on leave, TDY, or officially detained or excused from duty may be accounted for by refer-
     ence to their official documentation such as leave forms, TDY orders, or equivalent.
     5.1.2. Augmentee recall strength reporting and accounting will be accomplished by the individ-
     ual’s assigned unit, not the augmented unit.
  5.2. The CSS will compile the information for the CAT Director for updates on the current strength
  status a minimum of every hour, starting 1 hour after recall. For Recall Option A, the following objec-
  tives apply:
     5.2.1. Ten percent (10%) of available personnel present or accounted for within 1 hour.
     5.2.2. Fifty percent (50%) of available personnel present or accounted for within 2 hours.
     5.2.3. One hundred percent (100%) of available personnel present or accounted for within 3
     hours.
     5.2.4. All recall messages (Attachment 4 and Attachment 5) for TDY/leave personnel gener-
     ated/sent within 4 hours.
     5.2.5. UCCs will be prepared to provide copies of all recall messages to their GCC or CSS repre-
     sentative as requested.
  5.3. The strength reports for the CSS, GCCs, and UCCs will include: 1) total assigned personnel, 2)
  total available for duty, 3) total present for duty or accounted for, and 4) total percentage present for
  duty. The Unit Status Worksheets (see Attachment 3) are a guide to aid data collection and reporting.
     5.3.1. 6th Mission Support Squadron, Personnel Systems and Readiness Flight (6 MSS/DPMD)
     will provide initial (within 30 days) and semiannual refresher training on the accountability data-
     base to newly assigned GCC and CSS personnel. Documentation of training will be kept in 6
     MSS/DPM and GCC/CSS continuity books. GCCs will provide training on the accountability
     database to newly assigned UCC personnel. UCCs will keep documentation of this training within
     their continuity books.
