1. Terms Explained:
    1.1. Acclimatization. A series of gradual physiological adjustments that improves an individual’s
    ability to tolerate heat stress when exposed to a hot environment. Acclimatization requires physical
    activity under heat stress conditions similar to those anticipated for the work and produces beneficial
    physiological changes to the individual that minimize the risk of heat injury. A period of 1 or 2 weeks
    with a constant degree of heat exposure including 2 or more hours of physical exertion per day should
    be allowed for acclimatization. Once acclimatized, personnel will retain most of their adaptation for
    approximately 1 week after leaving the hot environment.
    1.2. Heat Disorders. A general term used to indicate any type of adverse heat related health problems
    to include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, heat syncope and heat rash. Heat disorders may
    be recognized by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, fever, dizziness, head-
    ache, faintness, abnormal sweating, convulsions, lack of coordination, mental confusion, uncon-
    sciousness, rash, and abdominal or leg cramps. Personnel most likely to be affected by the heat are
    individuals who have just arrived from cooler regions and those who are obese or in poor physical
    condition. Heat disorders are expressed as follows:
       1.2.1. Heat Cramps. Painful intermittent spasms of the voluntary muscles following shifts in flu-
       ids, salt and electrolytes. Heat cramps occur during or following strenuous physical activity.
       Workers may relieve heat cramps by drinking electrolyte solutions, or intravenous saline solutions
       if medically required.
       1.2.2. Heat Exhaustion. Heat exhaustion occurs from the loss of fluid through sweating, when a
       worker fails to drink enough fluids. The worker with heat exhaustion still sweats but may experi-
       ence extreme weakness or fatigue, giddiness, nausea, or headache. They can still think normally –
       if they cannot, they must be treated as heat stroke. The skin is clammy and moist, the complexion
       pale or flushed, and the body temperature normal or slightly higher. Treatment for heat exhaustion
       is usually simple: The victim should rest in a cool place and drink an electrolyte solution/sports
       drink (a beverage used by athletes to quickly restore potassium, calcium, and magnesium salts). In
       accordance with AF policy, sports drinks should be diluted 50/50 with water for maximum effec-
       tiveness. Severe cases involving victims who vomit or lose consciousness may require longer
       treatment under medical supervision.
       1.2.3. Heat Stroke. A life threatening condition and considered a medical emergency. Heat stroke
       is caused by exposure to a hot environment in which the body is unable to cool itself sufficiently.
       This results in the body temperature rising rapidly. Heat stroke is a much more serious condition
       than heat cramps or heat exhaustion. The exposed skin is hot, dry and flushed (clothing may be
       damp, but the individual is no longer producing sweat). Increased body temperature, if uncon-
       trolled, may lead to delirium, altered mental status, convulsions, coma and death.
       1.2.4. Heat Syncope (Fainting). A worker not acclimated to a hot environment, who simply stands
       still in the heat, may experience heat syncope. Victims usually recover quickly after lying down
       for a brief period. Moving around, rather than standing still, will usually reduce the possibility of
       fainting. Ensure that none of the other heat injury symptoms above are present, since fainting can
       accompany heat stroke or heat exhaustion.
       1.2.5. Heat Rash. Also known as prickly heat may occur in hot and humid environments where
       sweat is not easily removed from the surface of the skin by evaporation. When extensive or com-
       plicated by infection, heat rash may impede a worker's performance by inhibiting sleep. It can
HOLLOMANAFBI48-106 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                            3


       even result in temporary total disability. Resting in a cool place and allowing the skin to dry can
       prevent it. Taking a cold shower as soon as possible after work or exercise is the best remedy for
       rashes.
   1.3. Heat Stress. A combination of environmental and physical work factors that constitute the total
   heat load imposed on the body. The environmental factors of heat stress are the air temperature, radi-
   ant heat exchange, air movement and water vapor pressure. Physical work intensity contributes to the
   total heat stress placed on the body by producing metabolic heat in proportion to the intensity of the
   work.
   1.4. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index. The WBGT Index is the most practical heat stress
   index for characterizing the effect of a heat stress environment on an individual. WBGT Index takes
   into account air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air speed and humidity.

        plished before 1 April or after 1 October as necessitated by heat stress conditions.
HOLLOMANAFBI48-106 14 AUGUST 2008                                                                         5


       2.6.3. Notifies 49 FW/CP senior controller of any change to the heat stress category.
   2.7. The 49 FW/CP: Announce any change in WBGT category over the commanders NET and to the
   49th Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) (49 FW/CPM).
   2.8. The 49 FW/CPM: Announce any changes to the WBGT condition over the ramp nets.
3. Prevention: The best cure for heat disorders is prevention. Supervisors must take a proactive approach
and prepare early for the hot season. Several actions can be taken before the hot weather starts to maxi-
mize the ability of workers to tolerate hot, dry conditions. Newly assigned workers will require more
attention than those who have had the chance to adjust. Constant monitoring of worker physiological con-
dition by supervisors and other workers is essential, regardless of the perceived fitness. WBGT exposure
control limits are a tool that commanders and supervisors can use to help prevent heat stress and heat dis-
orders.
    3.1. Workload and Fluid Intake: Guidelines for work/rest schedules and fluid intake in the WBGT
    precaution zones for both acclimatized and unacclimatized personnel in hot environments are pro-
    vided in the following Table 1. and Table 2.. Table 3. provides the WBGT stages with associated flag
    colors.

NOTES:
     a. For all three work rates, individual water requirement may vary by +/- 0.25 quarts per hour.
        Daily fluid intake should not exceed 10 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not exceed 1 quart.
       b. Wearing all Mission-Oriented Protective Posture overgarments, fire-fighting gear, tyvek suits
          or other similar restrictive or impermeable clothing adds 10 degrees Fahrenheit to WBGT.
          Wearing body armor adds 5 degrees Fahrenheit to WBGT.
       c. Rest means minimal physical activity, i.e. sitting or standing, accomplished in the shade if
          possible.

    3.3. Urine Color: Thirst is an unreliable guide to the level of hydration. Urine color is a reliable indi-
    cator of an individual’s hydration status. Personnel exposed to hot weather conditions are required to
    drink sufficient water IAW Table 1. and Table 2. of this instruction in which their urine remains col-
    orless. Attachment 3 should be posted in all restrooms and portable toilets.

4. Sport Drink Fluid Supplements:
    4.1. A plentiful supply of water, adequate work planning and rest cycles are primary effective mea-
    sures in sustaining healthful working conditions. Personnel working in extreme heat may also benefit
    from the consumption of additional diluted sports drinks.
    4.2. Units in which members perform heavy work in Heat Category 3 or higher may be authorized use
    of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds to purchase sports drinks through competent medical
    authority recommendation (49 MDG/CC) and authorization as specified in Air Force Medical Opera-
    tions Agency Commander (AFMOA/CC) Policy Letter, Revised Policy on the Role of Sports Drinks
    in Prevention of Dehydration and Heat Illness, dated 23 Aug 01. If sports drink procurement through

   O&M funds is approved, appropriate work controls and rest cycles should continue to be feasibly
   enforced.
   4.3. Carbohydrate content of sport drinks should not exceed 15% prior to dilution. Dilution should be
   half strength (1 part water, 1 part beverage or 2 parts water: 1 part beverage powder). The purchase of
   individual sized containers is recommended over powder beverages.
   4.4. Undiluted portions of open sports drinks should be refrigerated. Beverages should be consumed
   within 8 hours if refrigerated or 4 hours if warm and then discarded.

                                       HEAT STRESS BRIEFING

A2.1. Purpose. To brief all personnel on factors that affect heat stress and preventive measures on pre-
venting the risks of heat stress. This briefing should be given by first line supervisors to all personnel on
a routine basis and prior to all exercises.

A2.2. Factors Affecting Heat Stress.
   A2.2.1. Unit Factors:
       A2.2.1.1. Fatalistic Attitude - "Some casualties are expected."
       A2.2.1.2. Poor Doctrine - That withholding water can make a "hot weather fighter".
       A2.2.1.3. Poor Nutrition - Three meals per day are vital to replace salt and mineral loss.
       A2.2.1.4. Disregard for Weather - Meteorological conditions must be considered in establishing
       work/training goals.
       A2.2.1.5. No water or poor water supply at work and rest sites.
   A2.2.2. Individual Factors:
       A2.2.2.1. Any illnesses.
       A2.2.2.2. Adequate acclimatization.
       A2.2.2.3. Age over 40.
       A2.2.2.4. Obesity.
       A2.2.2.5. Alcohol consumption.
       A2.2.2.6. Lack of sleep/rest.
       A2.2.2.7. Lack of meals.

A2.3. Preventive Measures. The following preventive measures are a guide in preventing heat stress.
   A2.3.1. Prior To Exercise/Deployment:
       A2.3.1.1. Screen out individuals with even minor illnesses or pregnant women.
       A2.3.1.2. Be rested - 12 hours rest/8 hours sleep.
       A2.3.1.3. No alcohol.
   A2.3.2. During Exercise:
       A2.3.2.1. Prehydrate - Drink at least 1 quart of water prior to beginning of exercise/work day.
       A2.3.2.2. Provide three meals per day to ensure salt and mineral replacement.
       A2.3.2.3. Provide shade for rest cycles. Personnel should not lie down on hot ground or pave-
       ment.

        A2.3.2.4. Ensure personnel wearing the MCU-2P mask during simulations and exercises are
        allowed to remove the mask frequently for water breaks and to allow release of body heat through
        the head.
        A2.3.2.5. Provide cooled and flavored (if possible) water and control hydration as follows:


WBGT (°F)                                       QUARTS WATER/HOUR
78.0 – 84.9                                           0.5 – 1.0
85.0 – 89.9                                          0.75 – 1.0
90+                                                      1.0

        A2.3.2.6. Work/rest cycles should be adjusted dependent upon changes in temperature, humidity,
        wind speed, and solar radiant heat (cloud cover) to decrease the risks of heat stress during hot
        weather. During these rest cycles, it is important that, if personnel are wearing chemical gear, they
        remove it to dissipate body heat.

A2.4. Heat Stress Symptoms. Headaches, dizziness, faintness, nausea, vomiting, fever, profuse or
decreased sweating, cramps, convulsion, lack of coordination, and unconsciousness.

A2.5. Emergency Actions.
     A2.5.1. Move the individual to a cooler (not cold) location or into a shaded area.
     A2.5.2. Loosen tight clothing, remove perspiration soaked clothing and apply cool, wet cloths to skin.
     Fan the individual.
     A2.5.3. If the individual is conscious and not vomiting, give water to drink.
     A2.5.4. Seek medical attention. The individual should not resume normal activities the same day.
