This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-30, Explosive Ordnance Disposal.
The Inspection Checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and the
USAFE Supplement 1, inspection programs. This checklist is intended for inspection use. It identifies
compliance items that support guidance in the following: law, executive order, higher headquarters publi-
cation (Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force Instruction (AFI), Air Force Manual (AFMAN), Air
Force Technical Order (AFTO), etc.) and Major Command (MAJCOM) publications. This checklist
applies to active duty United States Air forces in Europe (USAFE) units. It does not apply to Air National
Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. It supports guidance in AFI 32-3001,
Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program. Units can supplement this publication to add internal compliance
items. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication on AF IMT 847, Recommenda-
tion for Change of Publication, to Mission Support Directorate, Civil Engineer, Readiness Division (HQ
USAFE/A7CX), Unit 3050 Box 10, APO AE 09094-5010. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management
of Records and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located

1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or assessment.
As a minimum, units should use USAFE inspection checklists in conjunction with the Unit Self-Assess-
ment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Higher
headquarters may use this checklist in whole or in part during visits or exercises. Users may add items
that, in the exercise of good judgment, require examination.
   1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items identi-
   fied by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector General
   (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key result
       areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-com-
       pliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect system reliabil-
       ity. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, DoD directive, safety or Air
       Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs will be referred to as significant guide items requiring
       direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs by using upper case and bold letters.
       1.1.2. CGI. These are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall perfor-
       mance of the unit. Non-compliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance
       but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Standard sentence case is used to
       identify CGIs.

2. Applicability. All items on this inspection guide apply to active duty USAFE Explosive Ordnance
Disposal flights.
