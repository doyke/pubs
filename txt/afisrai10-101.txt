This instruction implements AFPD 10-1, Mission Directives, and AFI 10-101, Format and Content of
Mission Directives. This instruction authorizes the Directorate of Manpower and Personnel to issue and
maintain mission directives. It explains what mission directives are and who uses them in AF ISR
Agency. It does not apply to the AF ISR Agency - gained Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve units.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision changes the name and all references from Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) to Air Force Intel-
ligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AF ISR) Agency. It also incorporates the new Air Force direc-
torate breakout and naming convention; DP to A1; XP to A5/8.


1. Mission Directives Explained. AF ISR Agency mission directives communicate a unitâ€™s mission to
its commander and unit personnel. They also provide a basis for interaction between the unit and other
organizations. AF ISR Agency mission directives are published in the 15XX series.

2. Who Issues Directives. The Chief, Manpower, Organization and Resources Division (HQ AF ISR
Agency/A1M), develops mission directives based on unit input and issues and maintains a current file of
unit mission directives for all AF ISR Agency units at squadron level and above. HQ AF ISR Agency/
A1M coordinates mission directives and all requested changes with the major staff offices at HQ AF ISR
Agency to ensure that they are current, complete, and consistent with the United States Air Force and AF
ISR Agency directives including those on unit mission and internal organization. HQ AF ISR Agency/

A1M conducts a yearly review of all mission directives to ensure currency. The Communications Direc-
torate (A6) conducts publications management and publishes the mission directives.
