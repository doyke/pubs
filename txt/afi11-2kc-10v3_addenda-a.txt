                                             Chapter 1

                             KC-10 AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATION

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. This chapter establishes basic planning factors to be used by planners, maintainers and
     operators at all levels of command and directs KC-10 aircraft configuration for local or
     training missions, worldwide missions and contingency operations, and CAPSTONE/DV
     missions. KC -10 aircraft may also be configured in accordance with governing operations
     order (OPORD) or fragmentation (FRAG) order.
     1.1.2. All units and agencies involved in preparing KC-10 aircraft for deployment in support
     of contingency and other operations will use this chapter.
1.2. Applicability.
     1.2.1. This chapter is applicable to all units operating or supporting KC-10 aircraft and
     provides mandatory standard configuration guidance.
1.3. Concept.
     1.3.1. Missions may be of short duration with immediate return to home station, or be to a
     specific location for an extended period of time to provide air refueling and airlift support for
     general purpose forces and strategic conventional forces. Subordinate commanders must be
     prepared to deploy KC-10 aircraft, associated equipment, personnel, and materials.
1.4. Terms. See Attachment 1.
1.5. Aircraft Configuration. Unit level operations, maintenance and support functions must
ensure KC-10 aircraft are properly configured in accordance with this chapter and applicable
aircraft T.O.s. Configuration codes designate the setup of the aircraft. Options for each
configuration determine the available space for cargo and passengers.
     1.5.1. Normal configuration for local or training missions will be code “B” or, if
     maintenance requirements dictate, a code “J”.
     1.5.2. All aircraft will be configured for deployment as required by implementing FRAG or
     OPORD.
     1.5.3. The unit will use the configuration checklists approved by HQ AMC/A4M. Checklist
     distribution will be made to all agencies involved with the actual aircraft configuration.
     1.5.4. After configuration has been determined, the Production Superintendent will be the
     single point of contact to ensure required configuration actions are complete.
     1.5.5. Proper aircraft configuration is the responsibility of the pilot in command.
     1.5.6. En Route Support Kits (ESK) or Mission Support Kits (MSK) will be carried when
     required, as outlined in each aircraft configuration.
     1.5.7. On a temporary basis, additional equipment may be required to satisfy mission
     requirements. When required, the tasked unit must assure that coordination includes
     appropriate functional areas and that additional equipment is onboard.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_ADDENDA-A 17 JANUARY 2012                                                          5


1.6. Configuration Procedures and Responsibilities. Units will determine the most suitable
aircraft for deployment based on implementing operation or FRAG order. Maintenance
scheduling or Special Mission’s Airlift will initiate work orders that require configuration and
weight/balance checks. Unit supervisors are responsible for ensuring that required items are
carried onboard aircraft as required. Excess quantities of these items will not be carried without
the Production Superintendents approval, unless specifically directed by deployment orders or
required for the deployment by unit supervisors.
   1.6.1. Weight and Balance. Unit weight and balance personnel will ensure accuracy and
   currency of Chart C. When aircraft are changed from daily configuration code B or J to
   another standard configuration, the change will be reflected on Form F by the Boom
   Operator. If a nonstandard configuration is required, the weight and balance data will be
   provided by the local configuration checklist.
   1.6.2. In the remarks section of an airlift request, users will supply cargo loading equipment
   information (i.e. pallet sub-floor requirements, winch, chains, devices, etc.). The additional
   cargo loading equipment type and quantity will be annotated in the Global Decision Support
   System (GDSS 2).
   1.6.3. Aerial Port personnel will deliver and load cargo handling equipment in excess of that
   required to be maintained onboard aircraft daily. This includes all 463L equipment.
   1.6.4. Cargo missions originating at the main operating base (MOB) will be load planned by
   the transportation unit in coordination with the wing current operations. Re-deployment load
   planning will be the responsibility of the unit movement officer.
   1.6.5. Maintenance personnel will ensure the aircraft is returned to daily configuration on
   return to home station.
1.7. Aircraft Configuration Waivers. Follow waiver protocol in AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 3
paragraph 1.4.
   1.7.1. Configuration waivers are needed any time equipment is placed in aisle spaces,
   equipment that hinders access to emergency equipment/oxygen, aircraft seats installed facing
   aft, and the cargo handling system used not as designed (i.e. moving rails, latch pawls, etc.).
   This list is not comprehensive or all inclusive. A waiver is required anytime a piece of
   equipment is installed in a place it was not designed for, or if it will hinder evacuation of the
   aircraft. The addition of equipment that is not listed in DD365-1, Basic Weight Checklist
   Record, Chart A, that has not been tested or certified for use in the KC-10 also constitutes a
   nonstandard configuration. Units will request a waiver from HQ AMC/A3VK for any
   departure from the standard configurations.          Approved distinguished visitor (DV)
   configurations will not require special waivers.
   1.7.2. If an IAU or extra IAU is to be carried from one point to another, it may be carried as
   aircraft equipment. The left side outboard restraint rails can be moved to their outboard
   positions, and the IAU positioned down the left side of the aircraft. The seats will not be
   occupied during takeoff, landing, or flight. No waiver is required.
1.8. Permanent Aircraft Configuration Waivers. The following is a list of permanent KC-
10A Non Standard Configuration Waivers. A nonstandard configuration exists after removal,

relocation, or addition of aircraft equipment referenced on DD Form 365-1, Chart “A" Basic
Weight Checklist Record.
     1.8.1. Joint Task Force/C2 Module. Includes: JTF C2 Module, JTF C2 Communications
     Suite, 7 Pallets (not including the Module or Communications Suite), and 75 seats. Pallets
     10L, 10R, 11L, 11R, 12L, 12R, and 13L are reserved for aircraft equip, special equip, and
     baggage. 4 seats are for crew chiefs, support personnel, or extra crew members. Seat
     availability will be dictated by mission requirements. The C2 module (CCM) is a 36-foot
     long Airstream-type trailer built in 3 sections commonly referred to as the ―Silver Bullet.‖
     Each section is permanently mounted on 12-foot long airdrop pallets. Since the trailer is not
     FAA certified for occupancy during takeoff or landing, do not occupy for takeoff or landing.
     Procedures for installing the module are in Section 5 of T.O. 1C-10(K)A-9.
        1.8.1.1. The module has the capability to carry up to 10 personnel, four in seats with seat
        belts. When cleared by the Pilot In Command (PIC) the communications suite operator
        and flight attendants (FAs) will proceed to the module after take-off, establish power
        application, and establish interphone contact with the cockpit. Once interphone contact
        has been established, additional personnel will be cleared to the module. The right side
        section of the environmental curtain and cargo barrier net should be stowed to allow easy
        access to the module after passing 10,000 feet MSL and reinstalled after the module has
        been cleared prior to final landing. Interphone contact will be established and maintained
        with the module operator anytime the module is occupied.
        1.8.1.2. The CCM is equipped with 10 Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS)
        units. In the event of a loss of cabin pressurization all occupants of the module will don
        the EPOS and proceed to the forward cabin when directed by the AC or a uniformed
        flight crewmember. Once seated in the forward cabin, they will be directed to use the
        drop-down masks as required.
        1.8.1.3. The aircraft commander retains overall authority to remove personnel from the
        JTF and CCM when passenger safety may be jeopardized (in-flight emergency, combat
        threat environments etc.). Aircraft commanders will be responsible to ensure that the user
        of the JTF or CCM is briefed prior to the mission on the takeoff and landing occupancy
        restrictions as well as the potential for removal from the JTF or CCM should flight
        conditions warrant. The JTF mission will be flown by experienced aircrews only.
        1.8.1.4. Normally, FAs will accompany the CCM and manage the DV and
        accompanying party. When reporting for the mission, they will provide the PIC with a
        current ground training report and copy of the most current AF Form 8 certifying that
        they are current and qualified to operate equipment on the KC-10. FAs are qualified to
        operate doors (normal and emergency operation), brief and monitor passengers,
        accomplish customs and border clearance, and operate emergency equipment located in
        the forward cabin and cargo compartment. The lead FA will coordinate duties with the
        senior Boom Operator before the mission. Management of the DV and party is the
        primary responsibility of the senior FA; however, the overall responsibility of managing
        the forward cabin and cargo compartment rests with the senior Boom Operator on board
        the aircraft.
     1.8.2. Senior Leader In-Transit Conference Capsule (SLICC). SLICC includes: palletized
     conference module, palletized berthing module, a transit case for each module and 75 or 16
AFI11-2KC-10V3_ADDENDA-A 17 JANUARY 2012                                                      7


  seats. Seat availability will be dictated by mission requirements. The SLICC is a deployable
  463L-compatible pallet that provides temporary first-class palletized seating for senior level
  personnel to utilize when traveling on other than Operational Support Airlift or Special Air
  Mission aircraft. The SLICC will only be loaded on Command and Control Module (Silver
  Bullet) equipped aircraft. The conference and berthing module will not be occupied during
  takeoff, tanker/receiver air refueling, approach, or landing. Procedures for installing the
  module are in Section 5 of T.O. 1C-10(K)A-9.
     1.8.2.1. The conference module contains two seats, a divan, work tables and audio/visual
     equipment. The berthing module contains two bunk beds and stowage compartments.
     The conference and berthing modules may be carried together or separately. The
     conference module has the capability to carry up to 5 personnel and the berthing module
     has the capability to carry up to 2 personnel. When cleared by the Pilot In Command
     (PIC) the crew chief and boom operator or flight attendants (FAs) will proceed to the
     module after take-off, establish power application, and establish interphone contact with
     the cockpit. Once interphone contact has been established, additional personnel will be
     cleared to the module. The right side section of the environmental curtain and cargo
     barrier net should be stowed to allow easy access to the module after passing 10,000 feet
     MSL and reinstalled after the module has been cleared prior to final landing. Interphone
     contact will be established and maintained with the module operator anytime the module
     is occupied.
     1.8.2.2. The SLICC requires 7 Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) units. In
     the event of a loss of cabin pressurization all occupants of the module will don the EPOS
     and proceed to the forward cabin when directed by the AC or a uniformed flight
     crewmember. Once seated in the forward cabin, they will be directed to use the drop-
     down masks as required.
     1.8.2.3. The aircraft commander retains overall authority to remove personnel from the
     SLICC when passenger safety may be jeopardized (in-flight emergency, combat threat
     environments etc.). Aircraft commanders will be responsible to ensure that the user of the
     SLICC is briefed prior to the mission on the takeoff, air refueling and landing occupancy
     restrictions as well as the potential for removal from the SLICC should flight conditions
     warrant.
     1.8.2.4. If FAs accompany the SLICC, they will manage the DV and accompanying
     party. When reporting for the mission, they will provide the PIC with a current ground
     training report and copy of the most current AF Form 8 certifying that they are current
     and qualified to operate equipment on the KC-10. FAs are qualified to operate doors
     (normal and emergency operation), brief and monitor passengers, accomplish customs
     and border clearance, and operate emergency equipment located in the forward cabin and
     cargo compartment. The lead FA will coordinate duties with the senior Boom Operator
     before the mission. Management of the DV and party is the primary responsibility of the
     senior FA; however, the overall responsibility of managing the forward cabin and cargo
     compartment rests with the senior Boom Operator on board the aircraft.
     1.8.2.5. When transported as unoccupied cargo, no electrical connections shall be made
     for SLICC and the extendable breezeway shall be stowed.

    1.8.3. Senior Leader In-Transit Pallet (SLIP) Configuration. The SLIP configuration is a
    modified delta configuration. The weight and balance information for this configuration is
    provided to enable the Boom Operator to make a one line entry on the DD Form 365 - 4
    Form F to account for the equipment. Each affected agency involved in the configuration
    change is responsible for ensuring correct installation of equipment.
       1.8.3.1. Pallet position 2R will contain the SLIP. Pallet position 3R will contain an
       empty pallet. Pallet position 2L will contain an IAU pallet with the seats removed. Pallet
       position 3L IAU seat pallet is unchanged, but the four front row seats will not be
       occupied during flight. The walkway will be installed along the aircraft right side up to
       the IAU cabinets. A modified panel is required to be installed in front of door 2R. Four
       EPOS are required to be placed in the SLIP and will be the primary emergency oxygen
       source for personnel occupying the seats.
       1.8.3.2. Boom Operators will subtract (-) 357 pounds and a moment of (-) 33 from the
       Form F.
    1.8.4. DV 1 Configuration. The weight and balance information for this configuration is
    provided to enable the Boom Operator to make a one line entry on the DD Form 365 - 4
    Form F to account for the equipment. Each affected agency involved in the configuration
    change is responsible for ensuring correct installation of equipment. The Production
    Superintendent will be the single point of contact to ensure required configuration actions are
    complete. Install two executive tables. The first one is installed between seat row 1 and 2
    center. Seat row 1C is turned 180 degrees and seat row 2C is relocated aft at station 528.
    The second table is located at station 563 after removal of seat row 3R. The following
    restrictions apply: NOTES: 1. Aft facing seats (row 1C) will not be occupied for takeoffs
    and landings. 2. Drop down oxygen must be readily available. 3. Install a tabletop on the
    bunks. Nothing will be placed on the table for takeoff or landing. 4. Install a carpeted
    plywood walkway from pallet position 4R through 9R.
       1.8.4.1. Maintenance, Dash 21, and Special Mission’s Airlift, will configure the aircraft
       in the following manner for DV Configurations: Add item C- 163 DV Buffet Table on

     The canon plugs will be disconnected for the right side IAU seat pallets. EPOS will be
     the primary emergency oxygen source for personnel occupying those seats. Security
     Forces (SF) personnel will don their EPOS hood prior to assisting detainees. SF
     personnel will be responsible for donning of detainees’ EPOS hood. Removed set of
     quad seats will be stored on a pallet during detainee mission (including positioning leg).
     After completion of detainee mission, seats will be reinstalled.
     1.8.8.2. Two side facing seat pallets will be loaded in pallet positions 7 L/R. These seats
     are for Security Forces (SF) for in-flight rest. If these seat pallets are not available, an
     additional IAU seat pallet (preferably one that fits in pallet position 3 L) will be loaded in
     pallet position 7 L for SF in-flight rest (7 R will be an empty pallet position). The side
     facing seats in the cargo compartment are for SF personnel to use for in-flight rest. These
     seats will not be occupied for takeoff and landing (including additional IAU seat pallet in
     their stead). SF personnel will be cleared by the Boom Operator prior to proceeding aft of
     the environmental curtain. EPOS will be the primary emergency oxygen source for
     personnel occupying these seats. The Boom Operator will ensure that EPOS is located at
     each seat. SF personnel will maintain interphone contact with the pilot at all times when
     the seats are occupied.
     1.8.8.3. After completion of the detainee mission, normal rules apply. Maintenance
     personnel will reinstall the quad row of seats. These seats may be needed to move
     additional SF personnel back to the CONUS. The right side seat pallets will remain
     disconnected and will not be occupied during flight. The side facing seat pallets in the
     cargo compartment will not be occupied during flight. All passenger seating will be at
     the discretion of the Pilot in Command.

1.9. Responsibilities. This section describes responsibilities and requirements (by functional
area) and provides specific guidance necessary for mission accomplishment. Exceptions will be
specified in operations or FRAG order. Planning responsibilities will be in accordance with
current directives.
   1.9.1. Logistics Plans. The unit logistics plans function will be the single focal point for all
   logistics support planning for deployment operations. They will maintain close coordination
   with the unit operations plans function and all logistics functions to ensure all logistics
   support requirements are met. Obtain specific support capabilities available at deployment
   location and relay this information to maintenance and operations plans to be used during
AFI11-2KC-10V3_ADDENDA-A 17 JANUARY 2012                                                       11


   mission support planning. Monitor all deployments to ensure adequate support is provided or
   drawn from the functional areas tasked.
       1.9.1.1. The operations group will provide the logistics plans function with information
       pertaining to aircraft configuration.
   1.9.2. Supply. KC-10 supply support is provided primarily by civilian contractor logistics
   support system represented at base level by the Contractor-Operated and Maintained Base
   Supply (COMBS). The COMBS manager must be made aware of the following information
   for all deployments away from the MOB to ensure appropriate range and quantity of items
   are included in the onboard support kit: Date and length of deployment, number of aircraft
   involved, number of sorties and flying hours planned, location of FOL, and peculiar support
   equipment requirements. NOTE: If security considerations preclude the COMBS manager
   from access to any of the above information, he or she must be made aware of appropriate
   supply levels and military port where material is to be shipped.
   1.9.3. Logistics Support Contractor (LSC). LSC is responsible for assembly of ESKs and
   MSKs. Quantities in kits may vary based on mission requirements. Maintenance will
   provide information required and work with COMBS manager to determine spares
   requirements.
   1.9.4. Senior Maintenance Supervisor. The senior maintenance supervisor is responsible for
   the deployed support kit and deployed support equipment. If required, contractor personnel
   may be deployed to manage the support kit at the FOL. These personnel must have valid
   security clearances and passports as required by KC-10 logistics support contracts. The
   designated kit manager will accept accountability prior to deployment.
       1.9.4.1. Items not available in the deployed kit. Contractor managed parts causing a not
       mission-capable supply status or partial mission-capable status on a Tanker Airlift
       Control Center (TACC) controlled mission will be relayed through AMC/XOCL to the
       MOB maintenance operations center (MOC). The MOB MOC will relay requirements to
       production supervisors who will coordinate the requirements with the COMBS. COMBS
       supporting units not on TACC missions (CHOPPED) will directly contact the supporting
       MOB COMBS.            Re-supply of ESKs and MSKs will be handled through
       AMC/TACC/XOCL.
   1.9.5. Aircrew Flight Equipment Accountability. Accountability of prepositioned Aircrew
   Flight Equipment will be the responsibility of the PIC and may be delegated to any member
   of the primary flight crew. Document equipment inventories on the AFTO Form 46,
   Prepositioned Aircrew Flight Equipment
1.10. Aircraft Maintenance. The maintenance concept is based on providing an organizational
level maintenance capability. It provides preflight, launch, post-flight, recovery capability, and
specialist support for line replaceable unit (LRU) removal and replacement. Deployed forces
will use maintenance support at the deployed location if compatible with aircraft systems. The
KC-10 deployment maintenance supervisor will supervise and control aircraft maintenance.
Maintenance requirements beyond the capability of the deployed personnel will be referred to
AMC TACC/XOCL for coordination with MOB unless specified in operations order.
