1. Procedures for Functional Check Flights                (FCF)/High    Speed    Taxi    Checks
(HSTC)/Operational Check Flights (OCF):
     1.1. FCFs and HSTCs are performed only by FCF certified crews and are coordinated
     through QA and the respective AMXS, IAW AFI 21-101_AFRC_Sup 1, chapter 8.16, 8.17
     and 8.18. OCFs will be flown by highly experienced Instructor/Evaluator Pilots, Boom
     Operators and Loadmasters for the MDS.
     1.2. Flight duration will be determined by the time required to check the system(s) causing
     the FCF to be flown. Minimum flight time is approximately one-half hour.
2. QA Responsibilities: FCF/HSTC/OCF:
     2.1. Maintain "Functional Check Flight Briefing/Debriefing Checklist and Log Sheet" (see
     Attachment 1).
        2.1.1. Review corrective action(s) on any discrepancies found during the
        FCF/HSTC/OCF and clear the inspection entered on the AFTO Form 781A (see
        Attachment 2).
        2.1.2. Ensure the completed FCF checklist is filed with the Aircraft Records for a period
        of three months or until replaced by a new FCF checklist, whichever is later.
3. Aircraft Maintenance/Maintenance Squadrons’ Responsibilities:
     3.1. Notify QA when an FCF/HSTC/OCF requirement is identified.
     3.2. Request Plans and Scheduling to coordinate with the 452d Operations Group (OG)
     representative to schedule an appropriate aircrew (FCF/HSTC/OCF).
        3.2.1. Coordinate with the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) the time and date
        when an aircraft will be flying/performing an FCF/HSTC/OCF.
     3.3. Ensure all maintenance requirements are complied with and the aircraft is configured to
     fly the FCF; provide QA the aircraft forms four hours prior to the scheduled briefing.
     3.4. The aircraft crew chief or a knowledgeable representative and QA will attend the
     briefing to answer any questions.
