FROM: 374 AW/CC
      Unit 5078
      APO AP 96326-5078

SUBJECT: Yokota Air Base Guidance Memorandum on 374th Airlift Wing Public Affairs
         Multimedia Products and Services

Releasability: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

       By Order of the Commander, 374th Airlift Wing, this is a 374th Airlift Wing Guidance
Memorandum immediately implementing guidance specifying the products and services
provided by the 374th Airlift Wing Public Affairs office. To the extent its direction is
inconsistent with other Air Force Publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance
with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

1. The items in memorandum are a list of products and services offered by the 374 AW Public
Affairs Office. Products and services are provided for official use only as outlined in AFI 35-
109, Visual Information, Ch 4.

2. Air Force multimedia resources are government-owned property used for official mission
support and historical documentation purposes. All resources must meet the guidelines of the
National Archive and Records Administration (NARA). Unofficial use of multimedia resources,
or their products and services, is illegal and violators are subject to prosecution. Unofficial use
by military personnel violates Article 92 of the UCMJ and may result in punitive action.
Unofficial use by civilian personnel may result in administrative or other disciplinary action
under applicable civilian personnel regulations or instructions. Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume I,
Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 65-603, Official Representation of Funds, for
clarification or exclusions. A customer’s signature on the Air Force Form 833, Multimedia
Work Order, certifies the products requested will be used for official purposes only.

3. Multimedia products that Air Force members and civilian employees produce or collect in
their official duties become the property of the United States Air Force. Multimedia products
that contractors produce or collect in their official duties become property of the United States
Air Force. Any product collected or produced to include the use of personal photographic and
video equipment or self-help equipment on federal property is subject to local Public Affairs
review prior to use outside of the military.

4. Motion media (video) personnel and equipment are restricted to operational requirements
except to document retirements or promotion ceremonies honoring Major Command, Numbered
Air Force, wing, and vice wing commanders. Change of Command ceremonies, important
historical figures such as Medal of Honor recipients, Order of the Sword recipients, or aerial aces
are also authorized for video documentation for historical and informational purposes.

5. Still media photographic personnel, equipment, and material may be used to document
official ceremonies, such as formal awards. When still media photographic personnel are not
available, Public Affairs may offer consumer-grade photographic equipment for self-help use.
Do not use government-funded multimedia resources to:

       a. Provide souvenirs, personal gifts, mementos or farewell gifts

       b.    Support or document farewell parties or social events, unless certified as newsworthy
            or having historical significance by the base historian or Chief of Public Affairs.

       c. Create products used primarily for entertainment during farewell parties or social
          events.

       d. Support MWR or services-sponsored recognition programs.

       e. Provide passports photos for civilian passports, unless required by official military
          orders.

6. Deviations from this memorandum for special needs or purposes require a memorandum of
justification signed by the requesting unit commander. Requesting units may be required to
supplement cost for services above and beyond those specified in this memorandum.

7. The following priority system will be used to determine availability of services provided:

       Priority I:     Emergency incidents requiring immediate response
       Priority II:    Mission-essential or urgent conditions requiring 1 or 2 days response time
       Priority III:   Normal day-to-day mission requirements – 5 working days response time
       Priority IV:    Necessary, routine requirements – accomplished on a space-available basis

8. Direct any questions regarding this memorandum to the Chief of Public Affairs at 225-5967.

        Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this Memorandum are
maintained in accordance with AF Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.




                                                 2
      This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
