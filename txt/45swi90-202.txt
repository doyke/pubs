The OPR for this supplement is 45 SW/IG (Mr. Ed. Boywid). This instruction implements and extends
guidance for Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201_AFSPCSUP1, Inspector General Activities. This
instruction establishes responsibilities for coordinating and fulfilling the support needs of a visiting
inspector general (IG) team.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This publication revises AFSPC inspection team support requirements for an Operational Readiness
Inspection-Compliance Inspection (ORI-CI) and must be reviewed in its entirety. This instruction has
been completely rewritten to comply with updated AFIs. A “|” indicates revised material since the last
edition.


1. Objective . The objective of this instruction is to establish responsibilities and provide guidance for
coordinating and fulfilling the support needs of a visiting USAF or HQ AFSPC Inspector General (IG)
Team during inspections of AFSPC units. It applies to all administrative and logistical support, including
space, equipment, supplies, personnel, communications, and security. This instruction makes base-wide
taskings to ensure visiting IG teams are properly greeted and supported for the duration of their visit. It
will be implemented by the office of primary responsibility (OPR), 45 SW/IG, immediately upon notifi-
cation of a pending inspection. Functional management inspections (FMIs), staff assistance visits (SAVs)
and other inspections of functional elements of 45 SW will be supported by the respective functional
OPR, using this plan as a checklist.

2. Execution . This instruction will be executed upon initial notification of arrival of higher headquarters
IG team, or as directed by the Commander, 45th Space Wing.

3. IG Inspection Support Responsibilities . Each agency tasked is responsible for implementing its
respective section of this instruction. To ensure proper support for the IG team all organizations are tasked
