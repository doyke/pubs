                                                                    INTRODUCTION

1.1. Introduction. The Military Construction and Family Housing Economic Analysis Guide provides guidance on the
preparation of Economic Analyses EAs) required as part of the project justification process for facility Improvement,
Replacement, and New Construction projects. A thorough and well documented EA is a critical factor in project approval
and subsequent Congressional appropriation. As such, the purpose of this manual is to assist in conducting and
documenting the results of EAs. The procedures and methodologies presented in this manual are based on Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 65-501, Economic Analysis.
1.1.1. This manual is specifically targeted to assist analysts in conducting and documenting EAs for:
• Military Construction Projects (MILCON).
• Military Family Housing Projects.
• Energy Conservation Investment Program/Federal Energy Management Program (ECIP/FEMP) Projects.
1.1.2. A separate section is provided for MILCON, Family Housing, and ECIP/FEMP EAs. These sections include step-by-
step guidance on how to conduct EAs, from defining the project objective to documenting the results.


                                                                          Chapter 2

                                                  MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

2.1. Purpose. This section of the Military Construction and Family Housing Economic Analysis Guide provides guidance
on the preparation of Economic Analyses (EAs) which are required as part of the project justification process for Military
Construction (MILCON) Improvement, Replacement, and New Construction projects. A thorough and well documented
EA is a critical factor in project approval and subsequent Congressional appropriation. As such, the purpose of this manual
is to assist in conducting and documenting the results of EAs. This manual supersedes the Military Construction Program
Economic Analysis Manual, dated Feb 94.

2.2. Facilities Covered. The procedures and methodologies presented in this manual implement Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 65-501, Economic Analysis, and Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 65-506, Economic Analysis. The information
contained in this section is relevant to all MILCON projects including:
• Administrative facilities.
• Transient quarters.
• Bachelor quarters.
• Maintenance facilities.
• Warehouses.
• Child care facilities.
• Mission support facilities.

2.3. Requirement. According to AFI 65-501, an EA is required for all construction and major repair or renovation
projects when:
2.3.1. Investment costs equal or exceed $2 million. (Investment refers to costs associated with the acquisition of real
property, non-recurring services, and start-up operation and maintenance (O&M). These are usually one-time costs,
although they may be spread over several years.)
2.3.2. Investment costs are less than $2 million but the principal justification for the MILCON project is economic.
2.3.3. The facility would improve organizational or operational efficiency, including consolidation of like organizations
into one facility.
4                                                                                         AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

2.3.4. The project consists of the disposal or major revitalization of many facilities that are energy inefficient or require
excessive maintenance and repair (M&R).
2.3.5. The project is a candidate for private sector development (PSD).
2.3.6. The project involves non-permanent buildings supporting short-term facility requirements and the investment costs
exceed $1 million, or if annual recurring costs exceed $200,000.
2.3.7. An EA is initiated as early as practical during the project planning process. An early start allows sufficient time to
collect all the necessary data to conduct a superior life cycle cost analysis, provides better information for early program
decision making, and lays the foundation for superior program support documentation. However, before you are
unnecessarily burdened by these demanding requirements of completing a full EA, conduct a preliminary EA (see
attachment 6) to provide an accurate and timely project recommendation to the decision maker.
2.3.8. An EA is updated when significant developments occur that would invalidate or significantly alter the conclusions.
Specifically, EAs should be updated:
• When there is a change in project scope.
• If there are major changes in the initial study assumptions.
• When new alternatives are identified that appear to satisfy the stated requirement.
• If projects are moved between fiscal years and changes in the unit costs for construction, renovation, or any other
     significant cost element exceed local price changes.
2.3.9. For the summer review of the budget, the EA has to be only approximately correct and developed within the last 2
years. However, for the Budget Estimate Submission (BES), the EA must exactly match the programmed amount and
scope.
2.3.10. An EA is not required if:
• The costs of conducting the analysis clearly outweigh the potential benefits accruing to the decision maker.
• The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) or higher authority directs a new or modified program and specifies how
     to accomplish the program goals.
• Legislation or a prior irrevocable management decision specifically exempts the project from an EA.
• There is only one method possible to accomplish the objective.
• The project corrects problems or violations involving health, safety, fire protection, pollution, or security, which are
     serious, urgent, or hazardous.
2.3.11. If an EA is not conducted due to one of the reasons specified above, a Request for Waiver from an Economic
Analysis is prepared by the sponsoring activity for the project. Figure 2.1 presents the waiver format as outlined in
AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis. The base financial analysis office, comptroller, and his or her functional counterpart,
as well as the MAJCOM must concur that a waiver is appropriate.

Figure 2.1. Request for Waiver from an Economic Analysis.

    An Economic Analysis was not prepared for this project for the following reasons:
    _____ a.     Project cost or benefits to be derived do not warrant the level of effort required to prepare a full and
    complete analysis. The factors supporting this decision are attached.
    _____ b.     There is only one method possible to accomplish the objective. Documentation of this condition is
    attached.
    _____ c.     The project and the method to accomplish it was directed by ________ as shown in the attached
    documentation.
    _____ d.     Project results from specifically directed legislation which directs the method of accomplishment, as
    documented in the attachment.
    _____ e.     The project corrects problems or violations involving health, safety, fire protection, pollution, or security
    which are serious, urgent, and hazardous.
    _____ f.     Other (List specific reasons why analysis was not prepared).

2.4. Project Coordination. According to AFI 65-501, the primary responsibility for performing the EA lies with the
Financial Management (FM) staff at the affected organizational level. Collateral responsibility lies with the Civil
Engineering (CE) staff and the project user. Therefore, completing the EA requires close coordination between CE, FM,
and the end user of the facility. The initiating CE office shall contact the local FM office early in the process for guidance
in preparing the EA. Figure 2.2 presents the responsibility matrix. Figure 2.3 outlines the approval process for MILCON
EAs.

2.5. Defining the Project, Formulating Assumptions, and Identifying Alternatives. A clear, concise statement of the
project objective is necessary in order to identify potential alternatives for the project. This section will assist the analyst in
accurately identifying the problem, defining the project objective, formulating assumptions, and identifying alternatives to
meet the need.
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                  7

Note: At each level of the above approval process, the cooperative effort between CE and FM offices must be completed
         and coordinated before the EA package is forwarded by the CE office to the next higher level or returned to the
         next lower level.

2.5.1. Collecting and Reviewing Background Information. The analyst will collect and review all written
documentation available that could affect any project alternatives. This review will include the most current DD Form
1391, FY 19__ Military Construction Project Data, and the attached construction cost estimate for the proposed project,
previous EAs, the Base Comprehensive Plan (BCP), and the Requirements and Management Plan (RAMP). Next,
interviews are conducted with personnel involved in the project planning process and with the current facility users. The
current facility users are a good source for identifying deficiencies in the existing facility. All information is collected in
writing, including the source of the data, and the name, organization, title, and phone number of each point of contact
(POC). The signed source documents are presented in Appendix C of the EA.
2.5.1.1. The interviews and background data that is collected will assist project planners in answering the following
questions:
• What is the problem?
• What is the total requirement both in size (i.e., number of square feet) and capacity (i.e., number of people)?
• What is the size and capacity of the existing facility?
• What is the age of the existing facility?
• When was the existing facility last renovated?
• Does the project include any buildings on the National Register of Historic Places or other historically sensitive
     programs?
• Does the project require asbestos, radon, or lead-based paint remediation?
• Does the existing facility meet health, fire, safety, and security requirements?
• Are O&M costs for the existing facility excessive?
• Is the existing facility efficiently utilized?
• Does the existing facility meet the functional needs of the users?
• Does the existing facility meet the requirements laid out in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for handicapped
     accessibility?
2.5.1.2. Many of these issues can impact the scope and cost of the proposed project. For example, a facility that is on or
under consideration for addition to the National Register of Historic Places cannot be demolished and demands unique
architectural/engineering compliance requirements for renovation. Traditionally, renovation costs are more expensive for
historic buildings because the sources for replacement materials are unique, hard to find, and costly. Additionally, it is very
difficult to achieve enhanced energy efficiency if modern energy efficiency features are not permissible. Finally, the
construction of a new facility next to existing historical buildings may require the adoption of similar exterior architectural
features, thereby increasing the construction costs.
2.5.1.3. Asbestos, radon, or lead-based paint in the existing facility can lead to costly abatement procedures which may
impact the project schedule. These costs may be incurred if the facility is renovated or demolished, depending on the scope
and type of remediation required.
8                                                                                             AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

2.5.1.4. In older facilities it can be very expensive to correct any health, fire, safety, and security deficiencies, or to upgrade
the facility to meet ADA standards. Older facilities also tend to be less energy efficient and require more maintenance and
repairs to keep them operational.
2.5.1.5. When reviewing the current facility situation, it is very important to consider the user. Does the existing facility
meet the needs of the user? Are the current working conditions affecting morale? Is an organization disjointed and spread
over several facilities? Would the organization work more efficiently if it were consolidated into one facility? Could labor
time be saved or duplicate functions be eliminated as a result of a consolidation? It is important to address these and other
types of user concerns when trying to define the requirement.
2.5.1.6. The following are possible facility deficiencies and other concerns that may need to be addressed for the proposed
MILCON project.
2.5.1.7. Current Facility Deficiencies:
• Space shortage.
• Space inadequacy.
• Inefficient layout/utilization.
• Structural deficiency.
• Utilities deficiency.
• Inefficient energy use.
• Security deficiency.
• Excessive O&M costs.
• Health violation.
• Fire safety violation.
• Safety violation.
• ADA violation.
• Asbestos present.
• Lead-based paint present.
• Radon present.
• Environmental clean-up required.
• Other deficiencies (specify).
2.5.1.8. Other Issues:
• Mission expansion or change.
• National Register of Historic Places.
• Facility user concerns.

2.5.2. Defining the Project Objective. From the information collected, a clear, concise statement of the project objective
should be developed. Most frequently, a MILCON project is proposed to correct one or more of the following deficiencies:
• A new functional requirement resulting from a new mission or change in mission.
• A space shortage.
• An engineering deficiency.
• A health, safety, fire, or security problem.
• Excessive operation and maintenance costs.
• Functional inadequacy, including facilities that do not meet current Air Force standards.
• An inefficient condition, including inefficient use of energy or space.
2.5.2.1. When writing the project objective, it is important that the statement not be biased toward any alternative. Also,
the project objective should be quantified to the extent possible. Once the project objective is clearly defined, the analyst
will identify alternatives that satisfy the requirement. Figure 2.4 presents examples of project objectives for several facility
types.

2.5.3. Formulating Assumptions. EAs are based on facts and data pertaining to the project in question. However, an EA
deals with costs and benefits occurring in the future. Since the future is unpredictable, assumptions and sensitivity analyses
are prepared to account for uncertainties. To avoid invalidation or bias of the analysis, assumptions based on realistic
assessments or anticipated conditions should be made only by qualified individuals.
2.5.3.1. There are several common assumptions made when preparing an EA for a MILCON Project:
2.5.3.1.1. Economic Life of the Project. The economic life for MILCON projects is different for each facility type.
However, the economic life of a renovated facility is normally less than a newly constructed facility.
2.5.3.1.2. Residual Value. Residual Value is the depreciated value of the facility. The start value for a replaced or newly
constructed facility is defined as the total DD Form 1391 construction cost, including Contingency, and Supervision,
Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH). It does not include demolition costs. Residual value is normally calculated using
straight-line depreciation of the start value over the project's economic life.
2.5.3.1.3. Inflation. In a constant-dollar analysis, costs and benefits are estimated based on constant purchasing power of
the dollar. Therefore, inflation adjustments are made only for those cost elements for which anticipated price increases
exceed the general inflation rate. However, when historical data is used to estimate future costs, historical costs must be
inflated to the base year (usually the project year) of the analysis. CE or FM staff may perform this task. It is critical that
the source documents indicate the effective year for all cost/price information used in the analysis so that the analyst and
reviewers know that appropriate escalation and discount values have been applied. The source and date of inflation indices
must be documented.
2.5.3.1.4. Base Year. A constant dollar analysis requires that all costs be converted to a common, or base, year to permit
equitable comparison of those values. Typically, the project year is defined as the base year for a given EA. Various tables,
such as the "USAF Raw Inflation Indices" and the "DRI Energy Inflation Indices" found on the Financial Management
Analysis Bulletin Board (FMABB), contain the factors used to make these conversions. See attachment 1 for the complete
definition of and instructions for accessing the FMABB.
2.5.3.1.5. Discount Rate. The discount rate is used to account for the time value of money when comparing the cost of
alternatives over several years. Most EAs performed to support Air Force MILCON programs should be priced in constant
dollars and discounted at the interest rate published in the most recent President's Budget (PB). The PB is published in
January or February of each year and includes both the constant and current-dollar discount rates to be used in EAs.
SAF/FMCE will provide the annual discount rates on the FMABB. These discount rates reflect the latest values contained
in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94.
2.5.3.1.6. Cost Savings. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) and energy costs are usually lower for renovation and/or new
construction projects than for Status Quo alternatives due to the increased efficiency of these facilities. Cost savings
estimates are generally made relative to the current Status Quo values in the EA.
2.5.3.2. Additional assumptions may be required when project data is unavailable, when future costs are uncertain, or when
a project involves unique circumstances.
2.5.4. Identifying Alternatives. For MILCON projects, there are typically five alternatives available to meet the objective:
• Status Quo.
• Improvement.
• New Construction or Replacement.
• Government Leasing.
• Private Sector Development.
2.5.4.1. The Status Quo alternative is considered the baseline for the EA. The Status Quo can be one or a combination of
scenarios. Four common examples are:
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                     11

2.5.4.1.1. The continued use and operation of existing facilities in their current condition.
2.5.4.1.2. The continued payment of Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) and Variable Housing Allowance (VHA) to
personnel living off base in private residential housing when there is insufficient dormitory space on base.
2.5.4.1.3. The continued payment of lodging per diem to personnel on TDY when there are insufficient transient quarters
on base.
2.5.4.1.4. The continued use of temporary leased space in a privately owned facility off base.
2.5.4.2. The Improvement alternative involves renovating an existing facility to eliminate deficiencies and/or reduce future
maintenance and repair costs, altering the facility to improve its operating efficiency, or constructing an addition to the
facility to increase space. Various levels of improvements can be addressed as alternatives, from minimal correction of life-
safety deficiencies to comprehensive "gut and rebuild" efforts. The actual work to be performed is explicitly documented in
the EA.
2.5.4.3. The New Construction or Replacement alternative consists of the construction of a new facility in order to
eliminate an existing shortage or deficiency, to meet a shortage or deficiency created by a new mission or mission change,
or to replace a substandard facility. If new construction involves replacing an existing facility, then the disposal of the
existing facility is addressed.
2.5.4.4. A Government Leasing alternative involves direct, long-term leasing by the Air Force of a suitable, privately
owned facility off base. GSA handles long-term leases for general-purpose facilities. If leasing is used to replace an
existing facility, then the disposal of the existing facility is addressed.
2.5.4.5. The Private Sector Development (PSD) alternative uses private sector resources and knowledge to provide facilities
for the Air Force. At this time, PSD is only feasible in cases where no direct payment or guarantees are provided by the Air
Force. However, new legislation is expected to be enacted to allow for direct payment and guarantees for family housing
and possibly dormitories.
2.5.4.6. In the case of a transient or bachelor quarters requirement, a Direct Compensation alternative may also need to be
considered. This will happen when:
• There is suitable housing off base for non-mission essential personnel within the allowable BAQ/VHA rates.
• There is suitable lodging available off base for TDY personnel within the allowable per diem.
2.5.4.6.1. A market analysis of the local hotel or housing market is normally conducted to assess the viability of a Direct
Compensation alternative.
2.5.4.6.2. It is also important to remember that improved facilities are just one way of meeting a need. Other alternatives
may include making operations more efficient so that a new facility is not required. For instance, a shortage of warehouse
space may be compensated for by acquiring new handling and stacking equipment that allows more efficient use of vertical
space (i.e., cubed footage) or instituting just-in-time parts provision procedures. Another solution may involve
consolidating related functions to make better use of existing or new space. These innovative approaches to meeting space
requirements can result in significant cost savings, and may offer the added benefit of improving operational efficiency
and/or productivity.
2.5.4.6.3. The above-mentioned alternatives are the ones most frequently addressed in MILCON EAs. However, an analyst
should always aggressively pursue all possible realistic alternatives, since the final decision can be no better than the
available choices. Throughout the EA process, the analyst will continually consider accepting new alternatives and
discarding old ones.
2.5.4.6.4. Occasionally, after a complete review of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the proposed project, the
analyst may conclude that there is only one feasible alternative. In this case, a waiver or exemption from the requirement
for an EA is required (see figure 2.1). This certificate must include all of the signatures required for a complete EA.
2.5.4.6.5. Cost is not a basis for infeasibility. If an alternative is selected based on cost, then an EA must be developed.
2.5.5. Disposing of Existing Facilities. If the alternative involves replacing the current facility either by means of new
construction, Private Sector Development (PSD), or a long-term lease, the issue of what to do with the existing facility must
be addressed. There are three common disposal practices:
2.5.5.1. Converting the facility to another use. This is normally only an option if an existing need could be met by the
conversion. Conversion and operating costs are assumed to be borne by the new occupant and are not included in the
economic analysis.
2.5.5.2. Demolishing the facility. This option is considered whenever the existing facility is substandard, if its site is
required for a new facility, or if there is no other potential use for it. Facilities are a resource, however, so before demolition
is selected, a review of all possible current or future uses needs to be conducted. The cost of demolition is included in the
EA.
2.5.5.3. Placing the facility in protective storage. This option involves closing up the facility and preserving it for potential
future use by providing periodic maintenance to preserve its structural integrity; "mothballing" and "pickling" are colloquial
terms for protective storage. The O&M costs associated with protective storage are included in the EA.
12                                                                                        AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996


2.6. Data Collection for the Economic Analysis. This section discusses the data collection requirements normally
included in a MILCON Economic Analysis. The costs associated with each alternative under consideration must be
quantified and included in the EA calculations. All costs the facility is expected to incur over the life of each alternative,
except sunk costs, are included in the life cycle cost analysis. Sunk costs are expenditures which are incurred before the
project has received final approval. These costs would not be recovered regardless of the alternative selected. Examples of
sunk costs include: project planning, preliminary design, and preparation of the economic analysis itself. Design costs are
considered sunk if they are obligated or spent prior to selection of an alternative. The amount of design costs that are
considered sunk will vary based on the project.
2.6.1. Construction and Other One-Time Costs. Most one-time costs normally occur early in a project's life cycle.
Construction costs are usually the most significant. However, all other one-time costs are also considered.
2.6.1.1. Construction/Improvement Costs. Construction/Improvement costs include design fees for the primary facility or
building addition, demolition, site preparation, utilities, roads and pavements, contingencies, and Supervision, Inspection,
and Overhead (SIOH). Since the largest percentage of the project cost is determined by the scope of the Improvement or
New Construction project, it is imperative that all primary and support costs are considered in the EA. Equally important is
the need for accurate and complete cost estimating capabilities. Parametric cost estimating systems, such as the Parametric
Cost Engineering System (PACES), allow the user to quickly and accurately compile costs for multiple project construction
or renovation alternatives.
2.6.1.1.1. Construction/Improvement costs are thoroughly documented on the DD Form 1391 and attachments. The DD
Form 1391 and attachments for an EA include:
• The project title, project number, and alternative name.
• The scope of the estimate in square feet.
• A brief description of the costing methodology or estimating system used.
• Dated sources for variables, such as area cost factors and escalation factors.
• The base year of the project cost.
• Authority signature for the estimate.
2.6.1.1.2. The estimate shows all interim calculations so that the values can be tracked from the source data to the total
project cost appearing on the DD Form 1391 and in the Life Cycle Cost Report. Clear documentation speeds review of the
EA. In addition, a clearly documented DD Form 1391 can be easily updated when the source data changes or when the
project is changed for a different program year.
2.6.1.1.3. When compiling project costs, special attention is also given to ensure that all costs associated with a renovation
alternative, such as asbestos abatement, lead-based paint remediation, environmental compliance, etc., have been
considered.
2.6.1.2. Other One-Time Costs. Accurate assessment and inclusion of other one-time costs is imperative to ensure a
complete EA. Examples of one-time costs include:
• The moving and storage of furnishings and equipment when users are relocated.
• The disposal and replacement of furnishings and equipment.
• Lease payments made for temporary off-base space.
• Temporary contracting out of the requirement.
• Tenant build-out requirements involving renovations to the temporary space in order to make the facility meet the
     users' needs.
2.6.1.2.1. All attempts should be made to time facility replacement or improvement construction activities to correspond
with the expected requirement. However, even with the best scheduling attempts, temporary accommodations may be
required. Occasionally, contracting out the requirement may be feasible and economical. In other cases, users may require
temporary accommodations. For renovation alternatives, this may involve moving the users into temporary leased space
while the existing facility is being improved and, following completion of the project, moving into the completed facility.
Lease rates are discussed below in paragraph 2.6.2.4. Moving and storage costs (drayage) can be obtained from the base
transportation office. The Interstate Commerce Commission can also provide approximate moving costs based on weight,
as well as requirements for cartons and custom-built crates. In addition, some tenant build-out, such as partitions, power,
and telecommunications, may be required to meet the users' requirements.
2.6.1.2.2. The improvement or replacement of a dormitory can result in some unique one-time costs, such as:
• Reconnection fees associated with telephone and cable television service.
• The moving and storage of personal belongings for dormitory residents.
• BAQ/VHA payments made to personnel in temporary housing off base.
2.6.1.2.3. As with other MILCON projects, all attempts should be made to schedule or phase dormitory improvements or
replacements so as to minimize these one-time costs.
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                             13

2.6.2. Recurring Costs. Recurring costs are the repetitive costs required to operate and maintain a facility. They are
generally calculated on an annual basis. Examples of recurring costs include:
• Maintenance and repair of the facility.
• Utilities, such as electricity, natural gas, steam, water, and sewer.
• Personnel costs, such as building management, lease management, custodial service, and security service.
• Lease costs.
• Miscellaneous costs, such as grounds maintenance, landscaping, and snow removal.
2.6.2.1. Maintenance and Repair Costs. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Costs include both Annual M&R and Periodic
M&R. Annual M&R expenses include preventive maintenance, unscheduled plumbing and electrical repairs, and minor
structural repairs that are required to ensure a safe and efficient work or living environment. Periodic M&R expenses
include major repairs to building components, such as roof systems, electrical systems, HVAC, plumbing fixtures, and
interior finishes. These costs can be estimated based on the expected life of the building system.
2.6.2.1.1. When an existing facility is associated with the Status Quo alternative, Historical Annual M&R costs are used to
project future Annual M&R costs in the EA. The analyst should collect and review at least 3 years of data in order to
develop a valid estimate. The Work Information Management System (WIMS) maintenance records maintained by CE are
the best source for the Annual M&R data. All historical costs are adjusted for inflation to the base year in the EA.
2.6.2.1.2. Renovation and replacement alternatives typically have lower Annual M&R costs than the Status Quo
alternative. Therefore, the historical M&R cost data are normally adjusted downward by an assumed percentage (25 to 40
percent, based on engineering judgment) for the improvement and replacement alternatives. These assumptions must be
clearly stated in the EA. The Building Age Multiplier (BAM) factors presented in figure 2.5 are used to adjust annual
M&R costs over the life of the improved or new facility.
2.6.2.1.3. Periodic M&R schedules are based on the expected life of the equipment or fixtures. CE can provide the date the
item was last replaced so that the analyst can project future schedules and costs under the Status Quo alternative.
Renovation and new construction alternatives generally begin with all new equipment; hence, replacement schedules are
based on the construction date. It is important to remember that scheduled intervals will often vary based on local
conditions. For example, the salt air in marine environments corrodes and shortens the expected lives of exterior
mechanical units, roof membranes and drainage systems, window frames, exterior doors, etc. Figure 2.6 displays the
generally accepted useful lives of various equipment and fixtures.

2.6.2.1.4. Periodic M&R costs can be estimated from local prices or by using the cost of any recent replacement of similar
items, including appropriate labor fees. If such cost data is unavailable, commercial sources, such as R.S. Means or Dodge
Cost Data can be used and documented. Another possible source would be comparable maintenance and repair costs from
another installation for a similar facility.
2.6.2.2. Utility Costs. Utility costs include the expenses associated with the provision of utility services, such as:
• Electricity.
• Natural gas or oil.
• Steam.
• Water.
• Sewage.
• Telecommunications.
2.6.2.2.1. Figure 2.7 presents an example of the methodology used to estimate annual electricity costs for all alternatives
based on an area (square footage) basis; other energy-consuming utility costs can be similarly calculated. The analyst uses
annual utility usage and facility size for similar facility types to estimate utility costs for the proposed facility. The most
accurate estimates of utility costs are available when bases can meter utility usage at the facility level. Utility bills or
Defense Utility Energy Reporting System (DUERS) reports provide total utility consumption figures for the facility.
DUERS or WIMS can also provide the necessary area figures. CE is the best source for this data. If possible, usage rates
from 3 previous years are averaged after adjusting them to the base year of the EA. Data Resources Inc. (DRI) Energy
Inflation Indices are used to inflate energy costs to the base year. This data is available from the FMABB.

    Government Lease
            Cost included in lease rate.

2.6.2.2.2. Non-energy-consuming utilities such as water, sewage, and telecommunications can also be calculated based on a
three-year average. Since improvement or replacement usually will not influence these usage rates, status quo values can be
used for all alternatives where the same users will move back into the facility. The analyst should inflate non-energy costs
to the base year using the Air Force Raw Inflation Table for the O&M account on the FMABB maintained by SAF/FMC.
2.6.2.3. Personnel Costs. Personnel costs include the costs of staffing building services, such as building management,
lease management, security, and custodial services. Personnel costs are calculated as the product of the number of
personnel and their burdened salary. Different alternatives or alternative facility designs can result in dramatically different
personnel costs. For example, a facility with a small number of exterior entrances would require fewer security personnel
than a design with numerous entry points or multiple, unconsolidated facilities. Or, a bachelor quarters with exterior
walkways would require fewer custodial personnel than bachelor quarters with interior corridors.
2.6.2.3.1. For transient quarters, personnel costs also include maid service and the front desk operation. Figure 2.8
presents an example for estimating annual personnel costs for a new bachelor quarters facility. Consult the FMABB for the
most recent tables of Military and Civilian Compensation.
2.6.2.4. Lease Costs. Lease costs are associated with using off-base facilities on either a temporary or long-term basis. If
there is an existing Air Force lease of similar space off base, then that lease rate per square foot is used to estimate future
lease costs for either temporary space or a long-term requirement under a Government Lease Alternative. If there is not an
existing Air Force lease, then the General Services Administration (GSA) lease rates for the appropriate geographic area
are used. The base office responsible for real property management can normally provide the GSA space rates. For most
facility types, Air Force leases are negotiated and managed by GSA. GSA rates are provided by functional space type (e.g.
office, conference, storage, laboratory, industrial). GSA lease rates are typically gross leases--that is, the lease rate includes
reimbursements for services like maintenance and utilities. Gross leases are also known as “full service” leases. The Air
Force has authority to negotiate and manage leases directly for land and unique, special-purpose facilities.

2.6.2.4.1. Leases for temporary space below the prospectus level can be implemented relatively quickly. The prospectus
level is roughly $1.6 million in constant year FY94 dollars. Leases above the prospectus level require a longer approval
process.
2.6.2.5. Miscellaneous Costs. Miscellaneous costs include grounds care and landscaping, trash removal, snow removal,
and other building services provided under contract. Many building services could be estimated either under personnel
costs, if the services are provided by base personnel, or under miscellaneous costs, if the services are provided by a
contractor. For administrative facilities, the median cost per square foot for building services can be obtained from the
Building Owners and Manager's (BOMA) Experience Exchange Report (BOMA International, Washington, DC, (202)
408-2662).
2.6.2.5.1. For a bachelor quarters facility, the primary cost element associated with a Direct Compensation (or Status Quo)
alternative is BAQ/VHA payments. Both BAQ and VHA payments are based on grade; however, BAQ payments are
uniform Air Force wide, whereas VHA is based on the geographic location of the military personnel. BAQ/VHA data can
be obtained from the Financial Services Office.

2.6.2.5.2. For a transient quarters facility, the primary cost element associated with a Direct Compensation (or Status Quo)
alternative is lodging per diem payments. The base billeting office can provide lodging per diem rates for the geographic
area. Where there are no existing transient quarters, the billeting office can also provide the number of "Certificates of
Non-Availability" that have been issued over the last 3 years.
2.6.2.5.3. BAQ/VHA or per diem payments may also be incurred when users need to find temporary accommodations off
base during a Renovation or New Construction project for bachelor or transient quarters. These costs would be incurred in
accordance with the construction schedule.
2.6.2.5.4. Figure 2.9 summarizes the suggested data sources for obtaining the data required to conduct a MILCON EA.
2.6.3. Project Schedule. The project schedule provides information about project phasing and facility occupancy under
each alternative. Many costs associated with the existing situation continue to be incurred during the construction period.
In general, cost savings, such as lower utility costs, cannot be realized until the new facility is occupied and the old facility
has been disposed.
2.6.3.1. Where the project schedule allows for phased occupancy, costs such as Annual M&R and utilities are pro-rated.
The occupancy or “move-in” date may vary for some alternatives due to different time factors associated with the
construction period, approvals, and the solicitation process.

2.7. Conducting the Benefits Analysis. A benefits analysis takes into account many of the intangibles that are normally
difficult to assess in an EA. Examples of benefits which might be considered are presented in figure 2.10. The list in figure
2.10 is by no means exhaustive, but it does include many of the benefits which are normally considered when evaluating
MILCON projects.
2.7.1. The FM analyst is responsible for conducting the benefits analysis. However, input should be provided by a variety
of installation functions including, but not limited to, the primary user or beneficiary of services from the facility, CE,
services, security police, transportation, and other appropriate agencies. One effective approach is to convene a
"roundtable" discussion with all participating organizations to determine benefit categories and weights, and to score each
alternative. FM should prepare a source document for the benefits analysis showing participants, assumptions, rationale for
benefit selection, and sources. This document must be signed and included in Appendix C of the EA.

2.7.2. Each project will have its own set of benefits to assess. Each benefit is ranked in order of importance and is provided
a "weight point." The next step is to estimate how well each alternative meets the objective. For example, a scale from 100
percent (Optimum Solution) to 0 percent (Does Not Meet Objectives) is used. Finally, the percentage estimate and the
weight points assigned to each particular benefit are multiplied to determine the benefit value. The sum of the benefit
values is the benefit score for that alternative. The alternative with the highest benefit score is the alternative which would
yield the most benefit to the Air Force.
2.7.3. It is important to understand how the weight point rankings work mathematically. For example, if a weight point of
1 is assigned for security, 2 for morale, and 3 for health/safety, these rankings indicate that morale is valued twice as much
as security, and health/safety 3 times as much as security. Hence, there may be situations where assigning a fractional
weight point, such as 1.25 or 1.5, may be appropriate. Additionally, alternatives may have benefits with equal weights.
Figure 2.11 presents an example of a benefits analysis conducted for a typical Air Force base.

2.8. Conducting the Economic Analysis and Analyzing the Results. The purpose of an EA is to determine the cost and
benefits to the Air Force of each alternative that is being considered for satisfying the current objective. The analysis
method generally uses a life cycle cost approach to determine the total net present value costs of each alternative. The Air
Force normally uses a mid-year discounting convention. The evaluation of net present value provides the Air Force with a
method of comparing the costs of alternatives with different economic lives.
2.8.1. The concept of present value is fundamental to the economic analysis. Present value calculations allow comparison
of different dollar amounts received or expended during different time periods. Discounting is the technique used to
determine the present value of future cash flows. The discounting process allows the analyst to take into account the fact
that money received or expended today is worth more than the same amount of money received in the future, even after
adjustment for inflation.

Figure 2.10. Benefits for Consideration For MILCON Projects.

  Accessibility - The extent to which a service or facility is accessible to the users. This can include location,
           transportation, and parking issues.
  Availability of Base Services/Activities - The location of the proposed project relative to the other services and
           activities on base.
  Environmental Impact - The evaluation of the potential environmental impact of each of the alternatives under
           consideration to meet the objective.
  Facility Adequacy - This criterion measures the extent to which a facility or service meets the needs of its user. Issues
           include: "Is there sufficient space/capacity?", "Is the layout compatible with the user?", "Are the utilities
           reliable?", etc.
  Health/Safety - This criterion allows the analyst to assess the health and safety environments that would be provided
           under each alternative.
  Historic Preservation - This factor needs to be addressed if the existing facility or a facility considered in one of the
           alternatives is of historic value and is likely to be altered or demolished.
  Land Use Compatibility - The analyst should assess the suitability of the site selection or location of each of the
           alternatives relative to the adjacent facilities and the base comprehensive plan.
  Maintenance - Newly constructed or improved facilities are easier to maintain and service. Many of these potential
           cost savings can be quantified and included in the life cycle cost analysis. Those benefits which cannot be
           quantified should be addressed here.
  Mission/Operational Impact - Some alternatives will have a positive impact on the mission or operations of the
           affected organization. A new or improved facility may increase the productivity or efficiency of its workers. If
           these increases can be quantified, they should be included in the life cycle cost analysis.
  Morale - Morale is important both to performance and retention of Air Force personnel.
  Off-base Effects - Off-base socioeconomic effects may be a consideration if a substantial increase in assigned personnel
           is anticipated. The criterion can also be used if an alternative under consideration for the base would result in
           either an increase or decrease in dollars spent in the local community.

 Security - Security refers to the ability of a facility to protect the resources it houses. Security requirements differ
         depending on the function performed and are often specified in Air Force regulations. If the security needs
         can be quantified across alternatives, then these costs should be included in the life cycle cost analysis.

2.8.2. Most EAs that are performed to support Air Force MILCON projects are priced in constant dollars and discounted at
the rate prescribed in the President's Budget. This is based on current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance
outlined in OMB Circular A-94. The base year used in the EA is the program year for which initial funding is requested.
2.8.3. However, if future costs and benefits are collected in nominal (i.e. inflated) dollars, the analysis should then be
conducted in inflated dollars. Since leases are often stated in inflated dollars, an analysis with a leasing alternative is an
example of an EA in which inflated dollars may be appropriate. If the cost of a lease is stated in constant dollars, then the
EA should be conducted in constant dollars.
2.8.4. The Air Force recommends using the PC-ECONPACK software package in the preparation of EAs for MILCON
projects. PC-ECONPACK is available from the US Army Corps of Engineers. For information on how to use PC-
ECONPACK, refer to the PC-ECONPACK User's Manual or hotline. For more information on obtaining PC-ECONPACK,
see attachment 1.
2.8.4.1. The National Institute of Science and Technology’s Building Life Cycle Cost (BLCC) or DISCOUNT programs,
developed for more general applications, are also acceptable for use in generating Economic Analyses for MILCON
projects. However, it should be noted that the BLCC program does not provide reports formatted consistent with DoD
report formats.
2.8.5. Overview of PC-ECONPACK. This section presents an overview of PC-ECONPACK and its application to
MILCON EAs. PC-ECONPACK is a comprehensive program incorporating EA calculations, documentation, and reporting
capabilities. It was developed and structured for use by non-economists for the preparation of complete, properly
documented EAs in support of DoD funding requests. PC-ECONPACK is menu-driven and features interactive display
screens which enable the user to select analysis parameters and to specify functions.
2.8.5.1. PC-ECONPACK version 4.0 is designed to be used on IBM personal computers and IBM compatible hardware
equipped with at least 5 megabytes of storage available on one disk drive and 640K Random Access Memory (RAM). At a
minimum, a ten megabyte hard disk is recommended for running PC-ECONPACK. The operating system needed to run
PC-ECONPACK on a personal computer is Microsoft's Disk Operating System (DOS) version 2.2 or higher.
2.8.5.2. There are several advantages to using the PC-ECONPACK computer program to conduct EAs:
• Individuals having limited expertise in economic techniques can successfully produce EAs.
• Repetitive calculations can be revised easily and quickly.
• Sensitivity analyses can be conducted accurately and easily.
• Reports are generated in a standardized format that is accepted by the Air Force, OSD, and Congress.
2.8.5.3. Data entry and modification in PC-ECONPACK are straightforward, with the User's Manual providing step-by-
step instructions. It is recommended, however, that the analyst organize the data as presented below in order to facilitate
data entry:
• Project Title.
20                                                                                          AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

•    Project Objective.
•    Organization Title.
•    Global Discounting Convention.
•    Period of Analysis.
•    Start Year.
•    Discount Rate.
•    Base Year.
•    Analysis Type (Primary or Secondary).
•    Cost Input (Dollars or Thousands).
•    For Each Alternative list the alternative name, residual value parameters, and names, discounting conventions, and
     annual costs of expense items.
• Assumptions.
• Discussion of Alternatives.
• Source and Derivation of Costs and Benefits.
• Non-monetary Benefits.
• Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis Parameters
• Results and Recommendations
2.8.5.4. PC-ECONPACK provides for two separate types of analyses: Primary and Secondary Analyses. A Secondary
Analysis is used to determine which of two or more alternative courses of action would most economically fulfill an
objective or requirement which is not currently being met. A Secondary Analysis does not include a Status Quo alternative.
A Primary Analysis is used to determine whether an existing requirement can be satisfied better through an alternative.
Each alternative is evaluated relative to the Status Quo.
2.8.6. Net Present Value of Alternatives. The Net Present Value (NPV) of an alternative is the sum of the discounted
costs of that alternative across the analysis period. To determine the least costly approach for meeting the EA objective, the
calculated NPVs of the alternatives under consideration should be compared. PC-ECONPACK presents the NPV for each
alternative in the Executive Summary Report (ESR). The NPV can also be retrieved from the Life Cycle Cost Report
(LCCR). The NPV is the last number under the column entitled Cumulative Net Present Value.
2.8.6.1. It is important to proofread the Life Cycle Cost Report to ensure that all the data input is correct. The analyst
should:
• Check for any typographical errors in the data input.
• Check that the costs are being applied in the appropriate years.
• Check that the construction expenditures match the construction schedule and the DD Form 1391.
• Ensure that the appropriate cost elements have been included for each alternative.
• Ask -- Do the results make sense? Are they reasonable? Are there any surprises?
2.8.6.1.1. Any errors discovered are corrected and net present values are recalculated.
2.8.7. Savings/Investment Ratio, Cost/Benefit Ratio, and Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost. The Savings/Investment
Ratio (SIR) is computed automatically for any Primary Analysis. The SIR is the ratio of future cost savings (or avoidance)
to the discounted investment cost. The SIR is a comparison of the alternative to the Status Quo alternative. A SIR greater
than 1 indicates that the value of the cost savings is greater than the value of the investment. SIR is a useful way to describe
each alternative's "bang for the buck."
2.8.7.1. The Cost/Benefit ratio shows the decision maker the degree to which benefits are being attained relative to costs.
The Cost/Benefit ratio for each alternative is calculated by dividing the net present value by the benefit score. The
alternative with the lowest Cost/Benefit ratio is considered the most desirable solution.
2.8.7.2. PC-ECONPACK also calculates an Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost (EUAC) for each alternative. The EUAC is
the amount of money which, if paid in equal annual installments over the life of a project, would pay for the project.
2.8.8. Discount Rate and Cost Sensitivity Analyses. At a minimum, all MILCON EAs should include a sensitivity
analysis on the discount rate. A sensitivity analysis is conducted at plus and minus 25 percent of the currently prescribed
discount rate found on the FMABB.
2.8.8.1. PC-ECONPACK addresses discount rate sensitivity analysis as a special case. The analyst can name the range of
discount rates to be tested by designating the upper and lower limits. The results of the discount rate sensitivity analysis are
presented in three parts:
• A graph depicting changes in NPV over the range of discount rates specified.
• A summary table that can be reviewed to see if the sensitivity analysis yielded any changes in the alternative rankings.
• A detailed report listing the NPVs by discount rate and alternative.
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                  21

2.8.8.2. In addition, PC-ECONPACK allows the user to define additional cost sensitivity analyses, up to a maximum of 30.
Any cost element which is significantly large and which is subject to uncertainty should be evaluated in the sensitivity
analysis. The percentage range for any cost element should reflect the degree of uncertainty surrounding the cost used in
the economic analysis.
2.8.9. Residual Value Calculations. The residual value accounts for the remaining monetary value, if any, of the proposed
facility at the end of the term of analysis. Residual value should be included and quantified as a cost savings whenever the
economic life of the facility in an alternative differs significantly from the term of analysis. The economic life of a facility
varies by facility type and quality of construction. Figure 2.12 presents economic lives for several facility types. The
economic life of a renovated facility should take into account functional obsolescence and be based on sound engineering
judgment.

2.8.9.1. For example, let's assume an EA has two alternatives for providing administrative office space:
• Improvement of an existing facility.
• New construction.
Continuing the example, then the new facility would have a useful life of 50 years, while the improved or renovated facility
would have a useful life of only 30 years. When a term of analysis of 30 years is used, a residual value assigned under the
new construction alternative reflects the cost advantage of the longer life.
2.8.9.2. PC-ECONPACK directly accounts for residual value on the alternative information screen for the Replacement
alternative. The analyst should select "Yes" to the "Do you wish to include a residual (salvage) value (Y/N)?" prompt and
select Residual Type 2, Straight Line Depreciation, as the type. The Start Value is the DD Form 1391 total construction
cost minus the demolition costs (demolition plus contingency and SIOH) as seen in figure 2.13. An end-of-year discount
convention is recommended for calculating residual value. A discounting convention for residual value can be selected
under the Alternative Information data entry screen.

2.8.10. Including a PSD Alternative. The Private Sector Development (PSD) alternative uses private sector resources and
knowledge to provide facilities and services for the Air Force. At this time, PSD is only feasible in cases where no direct
payment or guarantees are provided by the Air Force. The cost elements for the economic analysis are generally limited to
direct compensation to users (e.g., BAQ/VHA, per diem) and miscellaneous costs, such as moving expenses. However, the
economics of the PSD alternative must also be reviewed to establish feasibility from the private sector point of view. For a
transient quarters facility, PSD would be feasible only if the nightly room rate were lower than the lodging per diem amount
users were willing to pay. Similarly, PSD would only be feasible for military family housing and bachelor quarters if the
required rent to the developer was lower than the average BAQ/VHA received by the users. This feasibility check evaluates
whether developers will respond to a PSD opportunity and whether the selected developer would be able to perform.
2.8.10.1. To estimate the rates that a private sector developer would bid in response to a PSD opportunity, one approach is
to contact reputable private sector developers. The specific requirement should be described only in the most general terms.
Care must be taken to avoid giving a potential RFP respondent (for PSD or Military Construction) any unfair advantage.
One should be skeptical of the results since informal contacts with developers often result in unrealistic quotes. Another
approach to estimating the rates charged under a PSD alternative is to perform a pro forma analysis. A pro forma analysis
uses estimates of a developer's financing, construction, and operating costs to calculate the rate at which he will make an
adequate return. Development and analysis of a reliable pro forma requires familiarity with private sector financial
investment analysis techniques.
2.8.10.2. Including a Government Lease Alternative. A Government Lease Alternative involves direct, long-term
leasing or the guaranteed rental by the Air Force of a suitable, privately owned facility off base. When working with an
alternative involving a lease, it is important to be aware of the provisions of the lease. A lease which is constant over the
term of the analysis will generally have inflation already built in. Thus, a current-dollar analysis should be conducted.
However, a lease whose rate is structured to rise each year with the general rate of inflation can be included in a constant-
dollar analysis.
2.8.10.3. A current-dollar analysis is conducted if the costs of a leasing alternative are collected in inflated dollars. In a
current-dollar analysis, inflation factors are applied to costs which are not already collected in inflated dollars. Do not mix
constant and current dollars in the same analysis. The discount rate used in a current-dollar analysis is based on the yearly
projections of interest rates on US treasury securities with a maturity comparable to the period of analysis. These discount
rates are available from the FMABB.
2.8.11. Formulating Recommendations. The net present value results account for quantifiable costs. When reviewing the
results and formulating recommendations, non-quantifiable costs and benefits should also be evaluated. The cost/benefit
ratio quantifies these issues but the analyst reviews all the results and makes a final recommendation. At this point, the
viability of each alternative is once again addressed. In general, the alternative with the lowest NPV is recommended. A
recommendation for an alternative other than the alternative with the lowest NPV is made only with the support of an
extremely persuasive benefits analysis.
2.8.11.1. For example, an economic analysis for transient quarters could demonstrate that continuing to pay per diem to
transient personnel is the most cost-effective alternative. However, if off-base lodging is remote and a significant number of
the transients are distinguished visitors, the benefits analysis may demonstrate that construction of new quarters satisfies the
objective far more effectively. Hence, the economic analysis could recommend a New Construction alternative.

2.9. Documenting the Results of the Economic Analysis. An EA must be documented to allow complete replication by
reviewers. This section provides guidance on how to compile an EA. An EA contains:
• Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis*.
• DoD Executive Summary*.
• Table of Contents*.
• Executive Summary Report.
• Project Objective. This includes alternatives, assumptions and results and recommendations.
• Life Cycle Cost Report. This includes alternative data and the source and derivation of costs and benefits.

2.9.2.2. These signatures do not need to be physically included on a single sheet of paper, but all signatures are required on
the final EA before transmittal to HQ USAF and SAF. If more than one signature sheet is used, indicate the
installation/MAJCOM, project title, project number, scope/cost, and objective on each sheet.
2.9.2.3. PC-ECONPACK cannot generate the Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis; it is produced as a separate
document and is attached to the front of the EA. A completed Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis is included in
the sample EA presented in attachment 3.
2.9.3. Department of Defense Executive Summary. A Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Summary follows the
Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis. This Executive Summary is a clear and concise, one-page summary of the
EA and its conclusions. Figure 2.14 presents the format for the Executive Summary. PC-ECONPACK cannot generate the
DoD Executive Summary. It is produced as a separate document and is included in the EA. A completed sample is located
in the sample EA in attachment 3.
2.9.4. Table of Contents. A Table of Contents outlining the organization of the EA is placed after the DoD Executive
Summary. PC-ECONPACK cannot generate a Table of Contents; it is produced as a separate document and is included in
the EA.
2.9.5. Executive Summary Report. The PC-ECONPACK Executive Summary Report provides an overview of the EA. It
includes the project objective, the description of the alternatives, a listing of the assumptions, and a summary of the results
and recommendations.
2.9.5.1. Project Objective. The project objective is clearly stated early in the EA. Refer to figure 2.4 for examples of
project objectives.

2.9.5.3. Assumptions. According to AFI 65-501, all EAs must include a list of the assumptions made. These assumptions
must be clearly stated so evaluators can understand the level of uncertainty and risk inherent in the EA results. It is also
important to include the source for each assumption made. This section of the Executive Summary Report is not to be used
to describe the derivation and source of every cost element in the analysis--that information is included in the Source and
Derivation of Costs and Benefits section of the Life Cycle Cost Report.2.9.5.4. Results and Recommendations. This section
of the EA presents a comparison of the results for each alternative. It addresses the NPV, SIR, Benefit Score, and
Cost/Benefit Ratio for each alternative. A short paragraph summarizes the cost and discount rate sensitivity analyses
indicating whether or not the alternative rankings are sensitive to reasonable changes in costs and/or assumptions. The
conclusion paragraph includes the results of the life cycle cost analysis, the benefits analysis, the sensitivity analyses, and
any non-quantifiable issues related to the proposed project. Based on the conclusion, a recommendation is made.
2.9.5.5. At the conclusion of the PC-ECONPACK Executive Summary Report, a graph depicting the cumulative net
present values of each alternative is attached. This graph is produced by PC-ECONPACK.
2.9.6. Life Cycle Cost Report. The PC-ECONPACK Life Cycle Cost Report provides a detailed description of the costs
and benefits associated with each alternative.
2.9.6.1. Alternative Data. The Life Cycle Cost Report provides a printout for each alternative of the:
26                                                                                        AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

• Life cycle cost tables by cost element and year.
• Total costs by year.
• Discount rate factors by year.
• Present value costs by year.
• Cumulative NPV costs by year.
• Cumulative NPV costs by cost element.
• Percentage of NPV for each cost element.
2.9.6.2. Source and Derivation of Costs and Benefits. At the end of the Life Cycle Cost Report there is a text block to be
used for discussing the source and derivation of the costs and benefits. Each data element included in the analysis is
discussed separately in this section. Since many cost elements may be the same across alternatives, this approach can avoid
the redundancy which would occur if the cost elements are addressed by alternative.
2.9.6.3. Frequently, interim calculations for construction, utilities, M&R, BAQ/VHA, and other estimates, as well as
adjustments for inflation, need to be made prior to entering the figures into PC-ECONPACK. The methodology used for
these interim calculations can be presented in a table or chart such as the one shown in figure 2.7. Tables and charts can
facilitate the review of the EA for evaluators. It is very important to include the source and any interim calculations
conducted for all estimates and data used in the EA. Therefore, this section will refer the reader to the appropriate
signed source documents in Appendix C and interim calculations in Appendix D of the EA. Any assumptions that were
used in the derivation of the cost estimate are also reiterated here. For example, the derivation of Annual M&R costs might
read like this:
          Annual M&R costs for the existing facility were based on historical data provided by the Planning
          Department of the Civil Engineering Squadron (Appendix C). The data were adjusted for inflation to
          FY95 dollars (Appendix D). Annual M&R costs for the renovation alternative were assumed to be 10
          percent less than the Status Quo alternative. Annual M&R costs for the new construction alternative
          were assumed to be 15 percent less than the Status Quo alternative. These assumptions were based on
          interviews with CE personnel and are documented in the CE Source Document dated 29 April 19XX.
          (Appendix C).
2.9.7. Benefits Analysis. In the EA, the benefits analysis is presented in a separate section. This section explains the
methodology used to develop the benefit score used in the calculation of the Cost/Benefit Ratio. The discussion on benefits
analysis includes:
• An explanation of the methodology and rationale used to calculate the benefit score and weights.
• A description of each benefit category that is addressed in the analysis and a discussion of the results and rankings of
     each of the alternatives based on the benefit score.
• A chart or table similar to figure 2.11 summarizing the calculation of the benefit score.
2.9.7.1. PC-ECONPACK version 4.0 has added a fifth text block which can be used for the benefits analysis
documentation.
2.9.8. Cost Sensitivity Analyses. The PC-ECONPACK Cost Sensitivity Analysis is included in the EA. If the results of
any sensitivity analysis indicate a change in the alternative rankings, then this fact is highlighted and the implications are
discussed in the EA.
2.9.9. Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis. This section includes the PC-ECONPACK printouts pertaining to the discount
rate sensitivity analysis. For the discount rate sensitivity analysis, PC-ECONPACK provides a NPV versus Discount Rate
graph, a summary table from which the analyst can determine whether changes in the discount rate changed the original
ranking of the alternatives, and a detailed report listing the NPVs for each discount rate value used in the analysis. All of
these charts and graphs are included in this section of the EA.
2.9.10. Appendices. The EA appendices include the following:
• Appendix A - DD Form 1391 for the Renovation alternative. The Military Construction Project Data form for
     renovation of the existing facility is presented, which includes the project cost.
• Appendix B - DD Form 1391 for the New Construction alternative. The Military Construction Project Data form for
     the new construction of a facility is presented. This form includes the project cost.
• Appendix C - Source Documents. All of the signed source documents and supporting data are presented, including the
     name and phone number of POCs.
• Appendix D - Interim Calculations. All of the worksheets used in calculating utility, maintenance, moving, temporary
     leases, personnel costs, BAQ/VHA for military personnel, per diem for TDY personnel, and other estimates, as well as
     inflation/escalation adjustments are presented.

                                      MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING PROJECTS

3.1. Introduction. This section of the Military Construction and Family Housing Economic Analysis Guide provides
guidance on the preparation of Economic Analyses (EAs) required as part of the project justification process for Family
Housing Improvement, Replacement, and New Construction projects. This manual supersedes the Family Housing
Economic Analysis Manual, dated Feb 94.
3.1.1. The procedures and methodologies presented in this manual implement Air Force Instruction (AFI) 65-501,
Economic Analysis, and Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 65-506, Economic Analysis.
3.1.2. The Family Housing Economic Analysis Section is divided into five remaining parts outlining the steps in the EA
process:
• Defining the Project, Formulating Assumptions, and Identifying Alternatives.
• Collecting Project Data.
• Conducting the Benefits Analysis.
• Conducting the EA and Analyzing the Results.
• Documenting the EA Results.
3.1.3. A Sample Economic Analysis for a Family Housing project is presented in attachment 4.

3.2. Requirement. EAs for Family Housing projects are mandated by Congress in Section 2812 of the FY91 National
Defense Authorization Act, and Section 2802 of the FY93 Defense Authorization Act. According to the legislation, an EA
is required:
• For all Family Housing replacement projects (Section 2802).
• For improvement projects when the most expensive unit exceeds $50,000 with adjustments for the area cost factor
     taken into account (Section 2812).
• For Family Housing New Construction projects with a total cost of over $2 million.
3.2.1. An EA should be initiated as early as practical during the project planning process and should be updated as
significant developments occur which would invalidate or significantly alter the conclusions. Specifically, EAs should be
updated:
• When there is a change in scope greater than plus or minus 25 percent, without a change in unit cost.
• If there are major changes in initial study assumptions.
• When new alternatives are identified that appear to satisfy the stated requirement.
• If projects are moved between fiscal years and changes in the unit costs for construction, renovation, or any other
     significant cost element exceed local price changes.

3.3. Project Coordination. According to AFI 65-501, the primary responsibility for performing the EA lies with the
Financial Management (FM) staff at the affected organizational level. Collateral responsibility lies with the Civil
Engineering (CE) staff and the project user. Hence, completing the EA requires close coordination between the CE and FM
organizations. The initiating CE office shall contact the local FM office early in the process for guidance in preparing the
EA. Figure 3.1 presents the responsibility matrix for Family Housing EAs. Figure 3.2 outlines the approval process for
Family Housing Eas.

3.4. Defining the Project, Formulating Assumptions, and Identifying Alternatives. A clear, concise statement of the
project objective is necessary in order to identify potential alternatives The objective for Family Housing projects is
normally to correct non-conformance with current Air Force Whole House/Neighborhood standards or to alleviate a housing
deficit. This section will assist the analyst in fully defining the project objective, formulating assumptions, and identifying
alternatives.

  Note: At each level of the above approval process, the cooperative effort between CE and FM offices must be completed
        and coordinated before the EA package is forwarded by the CE office to the next higher level or returned to the
        next lower level.

3.4.1. Collecting Background Information and Defining the Project Objective. The analyst will collect and review all
written documentation available that could affect any project alternatives. This review will include the most current DD
Form 1391 and the attached construction cost estimate for the proposed project, previous EAs, Base Comprehensive Plan
(BCP), Housing Community Plan (HCP), and the most recent Housing Market Analysis (HMA). Next, interviews are
conducted with personnel who are involved in the project planning process. All information is collected in writing,
30                                                                                         AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

including the source of data, and the name, organization, title, and phone number of each point of contact (POC). The
signed source documents must be presented in Appendix C of the EA.
3.4.1.1. The interviews and background data collection should answer the following questions:
• What is the problem?
• What were the results and date of the most recent HMA?
• What is the total or phased number of units to be improved or replaced?
• What is the square footage and layout, including number of bedrooms, of the existing and proposed housing?
• Was the existing housing built under the Wherry or Capehart programs, or 1970's vintage Appropriated Program (or
     other)?
• What is the age of the existing Family Housing units?
• When was the existing Family Housing last renovated?
• Does the project include any buildings on the National Register of Historic Places or other historically sensitive
     programs?
• Does the project require asbestos, radon, or lead-based paint remediation?
3.4.1.2. Many of these issues can impact the scope and cost of the proposed project. For example, a housing unit which is
on or under consideration for addition to the National Register of Historic Places cannot be demolished and demands unique
architectural/engineering compliance requirements for unit renovation. This may make compliance with Whole House
guidelines very difficult, and could give a false indication of associated costs. In general, renovation costs are more
expensive for historic buildings because the replacement materials are unique, hard to find, and costly. Additionally, it is
very difficult to achieve enhanced energy efficiency if modern energy efficiency features are not permissible. Finally, the
construction of new units next to existing historical units may require the adaptation of similar exterior architectural
features, thereby increasing unit construction costs.
3.4.1.3. Asbestos, radon, or lead-based paint in current housing can lead to costly removal procedures and may impact the
project schedule. These costs may be incurred if the units are renovated or demolished (depending on the remediation
method required).
3.4.2. Defining the Project Objective. From the information collected, a clear, concise statement of the project objective
should be developed. The statement of the objective must not be biased toward any alternative. For example, a Family
Housing project objective might read as follows:
          To provide housing that meets USAF standards for 100 enlisted military families at Anywhere AFB.
3.4.2.1. Once the project objective is clearly defined, assumptions can be formulated, and alternatives can be identified to
satisfy the requirement.
3.4.3. Assumptions. EAs are based on facts and data pertaining to the project. However, an EA deals with costs and
benefits occurring in the future. Because the future is unpredictable, assumptions and sensitivity analyses are prepared to
account for these uncertainties. To avoid invalidation or bias of the analysis, assumptions should be made only by qualified
individuals and should be based on realistic assessments or anticipated conditions.
3.4.3.1. There are several common assumptions made when preparing an EA for Family Housing:
3.4.3.1.1. Economic Life of the Project. The economic life for improved housing is normally 25 years and for new or
replaced housing is 40 years.
3.4.3.1.2. Project Phasing. Family Housing projects can involve the improvement or replacement of hundreds of units.
Frequently, the construction is phased due to limited funding or construction scope. Hence, improvement or replacement
may be spread over many months or years. If construction activities are phased over several years, construction costs should
be allocated in the EA according to the construction schedule. Savings of the various expenses due to partial occupation
during the construction year should also be taken into account.
3.4.3.1.3. Residual Value. Residual Value is the depreciated value of facilities. At the end of a 25-year analysis period
there would be no residual value for improved Family Housing. The start value for replaced or newly constructed Family
Housing is defined as the total DD Form 1391 construction cost, including Contingency, and Supervision, Inspection, and
Overhead (SIOH), less total demolition costs. Residual value is normally calculated using straight-line depreciation of the
start value over the project's economic life (usually 40 years).
3.4.3.1.4. Inflation. In a constant-dollar analysis, costs and benefits are estimated based on constant purchasing power of
the dollar. Hence, inflation adjustments are made for only those cost elements for which price increases are expected to
exceed the general inflation level. However, when historical data is used to estimate future costs, historical costs must be
inflated to the base year (usually the project year) of the analysis. This can be performed by the CE or FM staff but it is
critical that the effective year for all cost/price information be indicated on source documents and in the analysis. This will
ensure that the analyst and reviewers know that appropriate escalation and discount values have been applied. The source
and date of inflation indices must be documented.
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                   31

3.4.3.1.5. Base Year. A constant-dollar analysis requires that all costs be converted to a common or base year to permit
equitable comparison of those values. Typically, the project year is defined as the base year for a given EA. Various tables,
such as the "USAF Raw Inflation Indices" and the "DRI Energy Inflation Indices" found on the Financial Management
Analysis Bulletin Board (FMABB) contain the factors used to make these conversions.
3.4.3.1.6. Discount Rate. The discount rate is used to account for the time value of money when comparing the cost of
alternatives over several years. Most EAs performed to support Air Force Family Housing programs should be priced in
constant dollars and discounted at the interest rate published in the most recent President's Budget (PB). The PB is
published in January or February of each year and includes both the constant and current-dollar discount rates to be used in
conducting EAs. SAF/FMCE will provide the annual discount rates on the FMABB. These discount rates reflect the latest
values in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94.
3.4.3.1.7. Cost Savings. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) and energy costs are generally lower for Improvement or
Replacement alternatives than for the Status Quo alternative due to the increased efficiency of improved or replaced
facilities. Cost savings estimates are generally made relative to the current Status Quo values in the EA.
3.4.3.1.8. Additional assumptions may be required when project data is unavailable, when future costs are uncertain, or
when a project involves unique circumstances.
3.4.4. Identifying Alternatives. There are typically five alternatives available to meet the objective:
• Status Quo.
• Improvement.
• Replacement or New Construction.
• Direct Compensation.
• Government Leasing.
3.4.4.1. The Status Quo alternative is considered the baseline for the EA. The Status Quo can be one or a combination of
scenarios. Two common examples are:
• The continued use and operation of existing Family Housing in its current condition; or
• The continued payment of Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) and Variable Housing Allowance (VHA) to families
     living off base in private residential housing.
3.4.4.2. The Improvement alternative involves improvements to the current housing. Various levels of improvements can
be addressed as alternatives, including Whole House/Whole Neighborhood revitalization projects that may involve the
reconfiguration of existing units. The goal of an Improvement project is to extend the life of the current housing, to reduce
future M&R costs, and to improve the ambiance of the housing and associated neighborhood.
3.4.4.3. The Replacement or New Construction alternative involves the construction of new Family Housing to meet the
current need. New housing may be required to eliminate an existing shortage, to satisfy a shortage created by a new
mission or mission change, or to replace inadequate housing.
3.4.4.4. The Direct Compensation alternative allows (non-mission-essential) personnel to live off base and compensates
them directly in the form of BAQ/VHA. This alternative must always be considered in each EA conducted. However, if an
HMA conducted within the previous 3 years concluded that suitable housing is not available in the local market, this fact
should be stated with the results and considered when formulating recommendations and conclusions.
3.4.4.5. Government Leasing involves direct, long-term leasing or guaranteed rental by the Air Force of suitable, privately
developed housing on or off base. At this time, however, neither the leasing nor guaranteed rental program is a viable
alternative for providing Family Housing, although new legislation may make one or both options more attractive.
3.4.4.6. The above-mentioned alternatives are the ones most frequently addressed in Family Housing EAs. However, an
analyst should always aggressively pursue all possible realistic alternatives since the final decision can be no better than the
available choices. Throughout the EA process, the analyst should continually consider accepting new alternatives and
discarding old ones.
3.4.4.7. Occasionally, after a complete review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the current housing deficit, the
analyst may conclude that there is only one feasible alternative. For example, if the most recent HMA concluded that there
is an insufficient quantity of acceptable housing off base to meet the future requirements, and the current on-base housing is
filled, then the only feasible alternative would be new construction. In this case, a waiver or exemption from the
requirement for an EA is prepared. The exemption or waiver documentation includes a Certificate of Exemption from an
Economic Analysis and an Executive Summary which addresses why only one alternative is feasible. The Certificate of
Exemption from an Economic Analysis must include all of the signatures required for a complete EA.
3.4.4.8. It is important to note that cost is not a basis for infeasibility. If an alternative is selected based on cost, then an
EA must be developed.

3.5. Collecting Project Data. This section discusses the data collection requirements normally included in an EA for
Family Housing. The costs associated with each alternative under consideration must be quantified and included in the EA
32                                                                                           AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

calculations. All costs the housing is expected to incur over the life of each alternative, with the exception of sunk costs, are
included in the life cycle cost analysis. Sunk costs are expenditures which are incurred before a project receives final
approval. These costs would not be recovered regardless of the alternative selected. Examples of sunk costs include project
planning, design, and preparation of the economic analysis itself.
3.5.1. One-Time Costs. Many one-time costs normally occur early in a project's life cycle. Construction costs are usually
the most significant; however, all other one-time costs must also be considered.
3.5.1.1. Construction Costs. Construction and improvement costs include construction labor and materials, demolition, site
preparation, utilities, roads and pavements, Contingency, as well as Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH). Since
the largest percentage of the project cost is determined by the scope of the Improvement or Replacement project, it is
imperative that all primary and support costs are included in the EA. Equally important is the need for accurate and
complete cost estimating. Parametric cost estimating systems, such as the Parametric Cost Engineering System (PACES),
allow the user to run multiple scenarios for Improvement alternatives, while Replacement alternatives are calculated with
the Tri-Service Cost Model and documented on the DD Form 1391.
3.5.1.1.1. Construction/Improvement costs are thoroughly documented on the DD Form 1391 and attachments. The DD
Form 1391 and attachments for an EA include:
• The project title, project number, and alternative name.
• The scope of the estimate in square feet.
• A brief description of the costing methodology or estimating system used.
• Dated sources for variables, such as area cost factors and escalation factors.
• The base year of the project cost.
• CE Authority signature for the estimate.
3.5.1.1.2. The estimate shows all interim calculations so that the values can be tracked from the source data to the total
project cost appearing on the DD Form 1391 and in the Life Cycle Cost Report. Clear documentation speeds review of the
EA. In addition, a clearly documented DD Form 1391 can be easily updated when the source data changes or when the
project is changed for a different program year.
3.5.1.1.3. It is also important to ensure that Whole House/Neighborhood standards are applied equally for the respective
Improvement and Replacement alternatives. More precisely, a proper EA cannot be achieved when the project alternatives
differ in scope. Special attention should also be given to ensure all costs associated with the Improvement alternative have
been considered, such as demolition, asbestos or lead-based paint remediation, environmental compliance, etc.
3.5.1.2. Other One-Time Costs. The accurate capture of other one-time costs is imperative to ensure a complete EA.
Examples of other one-time costs for Family Housing projects include:
• The moving and storage of household goods when families are relocated due to construction.
• BAQ/VHA payments made to personnel in temporary off-base housing.
• Reconnection fees associated with telephone, cable television, gas, and electric utilities.
3.5.1.2.1. All attempts should be made to time housing replacement or improvement construction activities to correspond
with expected vacancies. However, even with the best scheduling attempts, some military personnel may be subjected to
multiple moves. For instance, a family might have to move into temporary housing while their unit is being improved.
During this time, the costs for storage of the member's household goods may also be incurred. When the temporary housing
is located off base, the Air Force pays BAQ/VHA, which must also be accounted for in the EA. A second move would be
necessary to relocate the family from the temporary housing into a newly renovated or replaced unit. Additional moves may
be required to facilitate complicated construction and/or personnel schedules.
3.5.1.2.2. Moving and storage costs (drayage) can be obtained from the base transportation office. This data is frequently
based on historical averages by grade. Moving costs can also be calculated based on the average weight of household goods
and the price per pound for the move.
3.5.1.2.3. Telephone, cable television, and gas companies normally charge a fee for the connection or reconnection of these
services. Initial cable and telephone connection fees are the responsibility of the service member. However, the Air Force is
responsible for any reconnection fees incurred by members as a result of moves required for military construction projects.
The installation CE is the best source for this data.
3.5.2. Recurring Costs. Recurring costs are the repetitive costs required to operate and maintain Family Housing. They
are generally calculated on an annual basis. Examples of recurring costs include:
• Maintenance and repair of housing units.
• Utilities, such as electricity, water, sewage, natural gas, and refuse collection.
• Miscellaneous costs, such as grounds maintenance, landscaping, and snow removal.
• Long term payments of BAQ/VHA.
3.5.2.1. Maintenance and Repair Costs. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) costs include both Annual M&R and Periodic
M&R. Annual M&R expenses include preventive maintenance, unscheduled plumbing and electrical repairs, and minor
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                              33

structural repairs that are continually incurred to ensure a safe and healthy living environment. Periodic M&R expenses
include major repairs, such as roof, HVAC, appliance, flooring, fixtures, and carpet replacement that can be estimated
based on the expected life of the equipment or fixture.
3.5.2.1.1. Historical Annual M&R costs associated with the Status Quo alternative should be used to project future costs in
the EA. The analyst should collect and review at least 3 years of data in order to develop a valid estimate. Work
Information Management System (WIMS) maintenance records maintained by CE are the best source for the Annual M&R
data. All historical costs should be adjusted for inflation to the base year in the EA.
3.5.2.1.2. Annual M&R costs for the Improvement and Replacement alternatives are expected to be less than the Status
Quo alternative. Hence, the historical M&R cost data is normally adjusted downward by an assumed percentage (25 to 40
percent, based on engineering judgment) for the Improvement and Replacement alternatives. Annual M&R costs over the
life of improved and replaced units are assumed to increase 10 percent every 5 years through year 25. These assumptions
should be clearly stated in the EA.
3.5.2.1.3. Periodic M&R schedules are based on the expected life of the equipment or fixture. CE can provide the date the
item was last replaced so that the analyst can project future schedule and costs under the alternative. The Improvement and
Replacement alternatives generally begin with all new equipment, and replacement schedules are based on the construction
date. These schedules, coupled with the availability of local estimates for such items, lend themselves to good estimates of
the associated expenses over the life of the housing. It is important to remember that scheduled intervals will often vary
based on local conditions. Figure 3.3 displays the generally accepted useful lives of various equipment and fixtures.

3.5.2.1.4. Periodic M&R costs can be estimated based on local prices or recent replacement of similar items and should
include appropriate labor fees. If such cost data is unavailable, then commercial sources such as R. S. Means, Dodge Cost
Data, or National Construction Estimator can be used and documented. Another possible source would be comparable
maintenance and repair costs from another installation with a similar Family Housing program.
3.5.2.2. Utility Costs. Utility costs include the expenses associated with the provision of utility services such as:
• Electricity.
• Natural gas or oil.
• Water.
• Sewage.
• Refuse collection.
3.5.2.2.1. Figure 3.4 presents an example of the methodology used to estimate annual electricity costs for all alternatives
based on an area (square footage) basis; other energy-consuming utility costs can be similarly calculated. The most accurate
estimates of utility costs are available when bases can meter utility usage at the neighborhood level. Total consumption for
Family Housing can be taken from utility bills or Defense Utility Energy Reporting System (DUERS) reports. DUERS or
WIMS can also provide the necessary area figures. CE is the best source for this data. Usage rates from 3 previous years
should normally be averaged after adjusting them to the base year of the EA. Data Resources, Inc. (DRI) Energy Inflation
Indices are used to inflate energy costs to the base year. This data is available on the FMABB.
3.5.2.2.2. Non-energy-consuming utilities costs, such as water and sewage, can also be calculated based on a three-year
average. Since improvement or replacement will not usually impact these usage rates, Status Quo values can be used for all
alternatives where the same size families will occupy the housing units. Some utilities, such as refuse collection, are
provided on a per-unit basis as demonstrated in figure 3.5. Non-energy costs are inflated to the base year using the Air
Force Raw Inflation Table for the O&M account on the FMABB.

3.5.2.3. Other Costs. Include in the analysis for Improvement alternatives all recurring or one-time costs for separately
programmed improvement or maintenance and repair work related to the housing units and associated neighborhood. The
associated neighborhood is defined as the housing area or facilities directly associated with the family housing units, such as
access roads and their sidewalks, parking spaces, walkways between roads/parking and housing units, landscaping adjacent
to housing units, and utility branch lines servicing the housing unit.
3.5.3. BAQ/VHA Payments. The primary cost element associated with the Direct Compensation alternative is BAQ/VHA
payments. Both BAQ and VHA payments are based on grade; however, BAQ payments are uniform across the Air Force,
and VHA is based on the geographic location of the military personnel. BAQ/VHA data can be obtained from the Financial
Management Office.
3.5.3.1. To calculate the BAQ/VHA costs, the number of military personnel by grade who would be assigned to the housing
must be determined. BAQ/VHA costs are the product of the number of personnel requiring off-base housing by grade, and
the associated BAQ/VHA rate. Figure 3.6 shows the calculation of monthly BAQ/VHA payments.

3.5.3.2. BAQ/VHA payments may also be incurred when personnel need to find temporary housing off base during an
Improvement or Replacement project. These costs would be incurred in accordance with the construction schedule.

3.5.5. Project Schedule. The project schedule provides information about project phasing and housing occupancy under
each alternative. Many costs associated with the existing situation continue to be incurred during the construction period.
In general, cost savings, such as lower utility costs, cannot be realized until the new housing is occupied and the old
housing has been disposed.
3.5.5.1. Where the project schedule allows for phased occupancy, costs such as Annual M&R and utilities are pro-rated.
The occupancy or “move-in” date may vary for some alternatives due to different time factors associated with the
construction period, approvals, and the solicitation process.

3.6. Conducting the Benefits Analysis. A benefits analysis takes into account many of the intangibles that are normally
difficult to assess in an EA. Examples of benefits which might be considered are presented in figure 3.8. The list in figure
3.8 is by no means exhaustive, but it does include many of the benefits that are normally considered when evaluating MFH
projects.
3.6.1. The FM analyst is responsible for conducting the benefits analysis. However, input should be provided by a variety
of installation functions, including CE, services, security police, transportation, and housing, as well as the current
occupants. One effective approach is to convene a "roundtable" discussion with all participating organizations to determine
benefit categories and weights, and to score each alternative. FM should prepare a source document for the benefits
analysis showing participants, assumptions, rationale for benefit selection, and sources. This document must be signed and
included in Appendix C of the EA report.
3.6.2. Each project will have its own set of benefits to assess. Each benefit is ranked in order of importance and is provided
a "weight point." The next step is to estimate how much each alternative meets the objective. For example, a scale from
100 percent (Optimum Solution) to 0 percent (Does Not Meet Objectives) is used. Finally, the percentage estimate and the
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                   37

weight points assigned to each benefit are multiplied together to determine the benefit value (seen in parentheses in the
figure). The sum of the benefit values is the benefit score for that alternative. The alternative with the highest benefit score
is the alternative that would yield the most benefit to the Air Force. Figure 3.9 presents a recommended example of a
benefits analysis conducted for a typical Air Force base.

Figure 3.8. Benefits for Consideration for MFH Projects.

     Availability of base services/activities - The location of the proposed MFH project relative to the other services and
            activities on base.
     Efficiency/Comfort- The extent to which the housing meets Air Force standards and the needs of the occupants. Issues
            include the quality of units, size, layout, comfort, number of bedrooms, etc.
     Health/Safety - The health and safety environments that would be provided under each alternative. Older housing may
            have lead-based paint, asbestos, radon, and other unsafe conditions.
     Historic Preservation - Addressed if the existing housing considered in one of the alternatives is of historic value and is
            likely to be altered or demolished.
     Maintenance - Newly constructed or improved housing is easier to maintain and service. Many of these potential cost
            savings can be quantified and included in the life cycle cost analysis. Those benefits which cannot be quantified
            should be addressed here.
     Mission/Operational Impact - Some alternatives will have a positive impact on the mission or operations of the
            installation. Having military personnel on base, for example, can enhance mission readiness.
     Morale/Retention - Morale is important both to performance and retention of Air Force personnel.
     Off-base Effects - Off-base socioeconomic effects may be a consideration if a substantial increase in assigned personnel is
            anticipated. The criterion can also be used if an alternative under consideration for the base would result in either
            an increase or decrease in dollars spent in the local community.
     Privacy - Evaluates the level of privacy each Family Housing alternative provides for military families.
     Security - Security refers to how safe military families feel in their homes. This can include improved locks, better lit
            neighborhoods, security gates, etc.

3.6.3. It is important to understand how the weight point rankings work mathematically. For example, if a weight point of
1 is assigned for security, 2 for morale, and 3 for health/safety, this indicates that morale is valued twice as much as
security, and health/safety 3 times as much as security. Hence, there may be situations where assigning a fractional weight
point, such as 1.25 or 1.5, may be appropriate. Additionally, alternatives may have benefits with equal weights.

3.7. Conducting the Economic Analysis and Analyzing the Results. The purpose of an EA is to determine the cost and
benefits to the Air Force of each alternative that is being considered for satisfying the current Family Housing requirement.
The analysis method generally uses a life cycle cost approach to determine the total net present value costs of each
alternative. The Air Force normally uses a mid-year discounting convention. The evaluation of net present value provides
the Air Force with a method of comparing the costs of alternatives with different economic lives.
38                                                                                        AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

3.7.1. The concept of present value is fundamental to the economic analysis. Present value calculations allow the
comparison of different dollar amounts received or expended during different time periods. Discounting is the technique
used to determine the present value of future cash flows. The discounting process allows the analyst to take into account the
fact that money received or expended today is worth more than the same amount of money received or spent in the future,
even after adjustment for inflation.
3.7.2. Most EAs performed to support Family Housing programs will be priced in constant dollars and discounted at the
discount rate prescribed in the President's Budget. This is based on current OMB guidance as outlined in OMB Circular A-
94. The base year to use in the EA is the program year for which funding is requested. The analysis includes 25 years plus
the construction period.
3.7.3. However, if future costs and benefits are collected in nominal (i.e., inflated) dollars, the analysis should then be
conducted in inflated dollars. Since leases are often stated in inflated dollars, an analysis with a leasing alternative is an
example of an EA in which inflated dollars may be appropriate. Should the cost of a lease be stated in constant dollars,
then the EA should be conducted in constant dollars. Do not mix constant and current dollars in the same analysis.
3.7.4. The Air Force recommends using the PC-ECONPACK software package in the preparation of EAs for Family
Housing. PC-ECONPACK is available from the US. Army Corps of Engineers. For information on how to use PC-
ECONPACK, refer to the PC-ECONPACK User's Manual or call the hotline. For more information on obtaining PC-
ECONPACK, see attachment 1.
3.7.5. Overview of PC-ECONPACK. This section presents an overview of PC-ECONPACK and its application to Family
Housing EAs. PC-ECONPACK is a comprehensive program incorporating EA calculations, documentation, and reporting
capabilities. It is structured so that it can be used by non-economists to prepare complete, properly documented EAs in
support of DoD funding requests. PC-ECONPACK is menu-driven and features interactive display screens that enable the
user to select analysis parameters and specify functions.
3.7.5.1. PC-ECONPACK is designed to be used on IBM personal computers and IBM-compatible hardware equipped with
at least 5 megabytes of storage available on one disk drive and 512K Random Access Memory (RAM). At a minimum, a
ten megabyte hard disk is recommended for running PC-ECONPACK. The operating system needed to run PC-
ECONPACK on a personal computer is Microsoft's Disk Operating System (DOS) version 2.2 or higher.
3.7.5.2. There are several advantages to using the PC-ECONPACK computer program to conduct EAs:
• Individuals having limited expertise in economic techniques can successfully produce EAs.
• Repetitive calculations can be revised easily and quickly.
• Sensitivity analyses can be conducted accurately and easily.
• Reports are generated in a standardized format accepted by the Air Force, OSD, and Congress.
3.7.5.3. Data entry and modification in PC-ECONPACK are straightforward, with the User's Manual providing step-by-
step instructions. It is recommended, however, to organize the data as presented in figure 3.10 in order to facilitate data
entry. PC-ECONPACK also allows the user to input text information. Paragraph 3.8 provides more information on how to
use PC-ECONPACK to generate EAs.
3.7.5.4. PC-ECONPACK provides for two separate types of analyses: Primary and Secondary Analyses. The Secondary
Analysis should be used to evaluate Family Housing projects. A Secondary Analysis is used to determine which of two or
more alternative courses of action would most economically fulfill an objective or requirement which is not currently being
met. The net present value (NPV) of costs are calculated for each of the alternatives and the rank order identified.
3.7.6. Net Present Value of Alternatives. To determine the least costly approach to meeting the EA objective, the analyst
will compare the calculated NPVs of the alternatives under consideration. With PC-ECONPACK, the NPV for each
alternative is presented in the Executive Summary Report (ESR). The NPV can also be retrieved from the Life Cycle Cost
Report (LCCR). The NPV would be the last number under the column titled "Cumulative Net Present Value."
3.7.6.1. It is important to proofread the Life Cycle Cost Report to ensure that all the data input is correct. The analyst
should:
• Check for any typographical errors in the data input.
• Check that the costs are being applied in the appropriate years.
• Check that the construction expenditures match the construction schedule.
• Ensure that the appropriate cost elements have been included for each alternative.
• Ask -- Do the results make sense? Are they reasonable? Are there any surprises?
3.7.6.2. Any errors discovered should be corrected and new net present values should be calculated.
3.7.6.3. PC-ECONPACK also calculates an Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost (EUAC) for each alternative. The EUAC is
the amount of money which, if paid in equal annual installments over the life of a project, would pay for the project.
3.7.7. Cost/Benefit Ratio. The cost/benefit ratio shows the decision maker the degree to which benefits are being attained
relative to costs. The cost/benefit ratio for each alternative is calculated by dividing the net present value by the benefit
score. The alternative with the lowest cost/benefit ratio is considered the most cost-effective solution.
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                39

3.7.8. Scope Sensitivity Analysis. To minimize EA revisions each time the scope of a project changes, "the OSD
Comptroller has agreed to the preparation of EAs which reflect sensitivity analysis for scope changes of plus or minus 25
percent with a corresponding change in total cost." Since there is a possibility that the number of units will change during
the review process, the FM analyst should perform a scope sensitivity analysis to reduce the likelihood of future revisions of
the same EA.

        Results and Recommendations

3.7.8.1. To perform the scope sensitivity analysis in PC-ECONPACK, the analyst enters into the cost sensitivity analysis
menu (menu item [7] of the Data Entry and Modification screen), and selects the Improvement alternative. The analyst
then reviews each separate expense item, determines if they would vary with a corresponding change in the number of units,
and selects those expense items accordingly. As a suggestion, anything "on site" should vary with a change in the number
of units. Next, the analyst selects the Replacement alternative, and determines if each separate expense item would vary
with a corresponding change in the number of units. These expense items are selected accordingly. The upper limit of the
expense items are varied by 25 percent.
3.7.8.2. The goal of the Scope Sensitivity Analysis is to see if the ranking of alternatives would change if the number of
units varied by plus or minus 25 percent. Since the cost sensitivity analysis menu in PC-ECONPACK does not allow the
lower limit to vary by 25 percent (it automatically decreases the lower limit to 100 percent), the analyst must do the
following: After entering all costs in PC-ECONPACK, select the "Cost Sensitivity Analysis Report" as one of the reports to
be printed.
3.7.8.3. The report "Table of Percent Changes Where Alternatives' NPVs are Equal" will display three columns. Column
One displays percent changes for the least costly alternative. Column Two displays percent changes for the higher cost
alternative. Column Three shows the NPV when the changes in Column One and Column Two yield the same NPV. Any
change in the alternative listed in Column Two above the amount corresponding to Column One will change the ranking of
the alternatives.
3.7.9. Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis. At a minimum, all Family Housing EAs should include a sensitivity analysis
on the discount rate. A sensitivity analysis should be conducted at plus and minus 25 percent of the currently prescribed
rate found on the FMABB.
3.7.9.1. PC-ECONPACK addresses discount rate sensitivity analysis as a special case. The analyst can name the range of
discount rates tested by designating the upper and lower limits. PC-ECONPACK recomputes the entire EA for each
alternative for up to 60 different discount rates within the designated range. The results of the discount rate sensitivity
analysis are presented in three parts:
• A graph depicting changes in NPV over the range of discount rates specified.
• A summary table which can be reviewed to see if the sensitivity analysis yielded any changes in the alternative
     rankings.
• A detailed report listing the NPVs by discount rate and alternative.
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                41

3.7.10. Residual Value Calculations. Residual Value is the expected value of an asset at any point in time before the end
of its economic life. PC-ECONPACK directly accounts for residual value on the alternative information screen for the
Replacement alternative. The analyst should select "Yes" to the "Do you wish to include a residual (salvage) value (Y/N)?"
prompt and select Residual Type 2, Straight Line Depreciation, as the type. The Start Value is the DD Form 1391 total
construction cost minus the demolition costs (demolition plus contingency and SIOH) as can be seen in figure 3.11. The
Economic Life is usually 40 years and the Beginning Year is the year of construction. An end-of-year discount convention
is recommended for calculating residual value. A discounting convention for residual value can be selected under the
'Alternative Information' data entry screen.

3.7.11. Formulating Recommendations. The net present value results account for quantifiable costs. When reviewing the
results and formulating recommendations, non-quantifiable costs and benefits should also be evaluated. The cost/benefit
ratio quantifies these issues, but the analyst must review all the results and make a final recommendation. At this point, the
viability of each alternative is once again addressed. For example, continuing to provide BAQ/VHA to personnel may be
the most cost-effective alternative. However, a recent Housing Market Analysis may have concluded that there is
insufficient housing in the private market for personnel. Hence, another alternative may be preferable.
3.7.11.1. A consideration at this time is the 70 Percent Rule. When improvement initial costs are estimated to exceed 70
percent of replacement initial costs, replacement may be considered in lieu of improvement, unless there is prevailing
justification to retain the existing units. A complete EA still must be prepared to assess the full life cycle costs of each
alternative, including careful consideration of the benefits of each alternative. The conclusions in the Executive Summary
of the EA must contain one of the statements indicated below.
• For Replacement: "The improvement/replacement initial costs ratio is ___% and there is no prevailing justification to
     retain the existing units. It is therefore recommended that the Replacement alternative be approved."
• For Improvement: "The improvement/replacement initial costs ratio is ___%; however, improvement of the existing
     units is proposed on the basis that ____________________. It is therefore recommended that the Improvement
     alternative be approved."

3.8. Documenting the Results of the Economic Analysis. An EA must be documented to allow complete replication by
reviewers. This section provides guidance on how to compile an EA. An EA contains:
• Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis*.
• DoD Executive Summary*.
• Table of Contents*.
• Executive Summary Report, including the project objective, alternatives, assumptions, and results and
     recommendations.
• Life Cycle Cost Report., including alternative data and the source and derivation of costs and benefits.

•    Benefits Analysis.
•    Scope Sensitivity Analysis.
•    Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis.
•    Appendices.
     (* Items must be created in a word processor or spreadsheet program.)
3.8.1. PC-ECONPACK can be used to generate most of the EA. PC-ECONPACK reports are generated in standardized
formats which summarize the essential components of a comprehensive EA. Six different reports can be generated:
3.8.1.1. Executive Summary: This report consists of several pages containing a brief discussion of each alternative,
assumptions, NPV, and EUAC for each alternative.
3.8.1.2. Graphs of the Cumulative NPV of each alternative.
3.8.1.3. Life Cycle Cost Report: This report provides an overview of all the detailed costs and benefits for each alternative
on a year-by-year basis.
3.8.1.4. Cost Sensitivity Analysis Report: This report is used for the Scope Sensitivity Analysis and other sensitivity
analyses that may be warranted.
3.8.1.5. Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis Report.
3.8.1.6. Input Listing: This is a line-by-line listing of all the data entered for the EA (not to be included in the EA
documentation).
3.8.2. Text can be entered into five text blocks:
• Assumptions.
• Discussion of Alternatives.
• Source and Derivation of Costs and Benefits.
• Results and Recommendations.
• Non-Monetary Benefits.
3.8.3. For more information on creating PC-ECONPACK reports, refer to the PC-ECONPACK User’s Manual.
Attachment 4 contains a sample EA that utilized PC-ECONPACK for a Family Housing project.
3.8.4. Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis. A Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis is attached to the
front of each completed EA. The certificate is normally a two-page document. The first page includes:
• Name of the installation and MAJCOM.
• Project title.
• Project number.
• Objective.
• Project cost.
• Alternatives considered.
• Summary of analysis results.
• Certification.
3.8.4.1. The second page, or "signature page" presents the signatures of the reviewers and evaluators certifying that they
have reviewed and concur with the EA findings. The signatures of the following personnel are required:
• Installation FM Analyst.
• Installation FM.
• Installation CE.
• MAJCOM/FMA Evaluator.
• MAJCOM FMA.
• MAJCOM CEH.
3.8.4.2. These signatures do not need to be physically included on a single sheet of paper, but all signatures are required on
the final EA before transmittal to HQ USAF. If more than one signature sheet is used, indicate the installation/MAJCOM,
project title, project number, scope/cost, and objective on each sheet.
3.8.4.3. PC-ECONPACK cannot generate the Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis; it is produced as a separate
document and attached to the front of the EA. A completed Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis is included in the
sample EA presented in attachment 4.
3.8.5. Department of Defense Executive Summary. A Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Summary follows the
Certificate of Satisfactory Economic Analysis. This Executive Summary is a clear and concise one-page summary of the
EA and its conclusions. Figure 3.12 presents the format for the Executive Summary. PC-ECONPACK cannot generate the
DoD Executive Summary; it is produced as a separate document and included in the EA. A completed sample may be
found in attachment 4.

3.8.6. Table of Contents. A Table of Contents outlining the organization of the EA follows the DoD Executive Summary.
PC-ECONPACK cannot generate a Table of Contents; it is produced as a separate document and included in the EA.
3.8.7. Executive Summary Report. The PC-ECONPACK Executive Summary Report provides an overview of the EA. It
includes the project objective, the description of the alternatives, a listing of the assumptions, and a summary of the results
and recommendations.

3.8.7.1. Project Objective. The project objective is clearly stated early in the EA. For Family Housing projects, the
objective is normally "To provide ___ [insert number and indicate Enlisted or Officer] Family Housing units meeting
Air Force standards."
3.8.7.2. Alternatives. A detailed description of each alternative addressed in the EA is included in the EA Executive
Summary Report. Figure 3.13 presents the information that is included in the description, by alternative. Justification must
be provided for alternatives that were considered but dismissed as infeasible.

3.8.7.3. Assumptions. According to AFI 65-501, all EAs include a list of the assumptions made. These assumptions must
be clearly stated so that evaluators can understand the level of uncertainty and risk inherent in the EA results. It is also
important to include the source for each assumption made. This section of the Executive Summary Report is not to be used
to describe the derivation and source of every cost element in the analysis. That information is included in the Source and
Derivation of Costs and Benefits section of the Life Cycle Cost Report.
3.8.7.4. Results and Recommendations. This section presents a comparison of the results for each alternative. It addresses
the NPV, the benefit score, and the cost/benefit ratio for each alternative. A short paragraph should summarize the scope
sensitivity analysis. The conclusion paragraph includes the results of the life cycle cost analysis, the benefits analysis, the
sensitivity analyses, and any non-quantifiable issues related to the proposed project. The sensitivity analyses are discussed,
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                 45

indicating whether or not the alternative rankings are sensitive to reasonable changes in costs and/or assumptions. Based
on the conclusion, a recommendation is proposed.
3.8.7.5. At the conclusion of the PC-ECONPACK Executive Summary Report, a graph depicting the cumulative net
present values of each alternative is attached. This graph is produced by PC-ECONPACK.
3.8.8. Life Cycle Cost Report. The PC-ECONPACK Life Cycle Cost Report provides a detailed look at the costs and
benefits associated with each alternative.
3.8.8.1. Alternative Data. The Life Cycle Cost Report provides a printout for each alternative of the:
• Life cycle cost tables by cost element and year.
• Total costs by year.
• Discount rate factors by year.
• Present value costs by year.
• Cumulative NPV costs by year.
• Cumulative NPV costs by cost element.
• Percentage of NPV for each cost element.
3.8.8.2. Source and Derivation of Costs and Benefits. At the end of the Life Cycle Cost Report there is a text block to be
used for discussing the source and derivation of the costs and benefits. Each data element included in the analysis is
discussed separately in this section. Since many cost elements may be the same across alternatives, this approach can avoid
the redundancy which would occur if the cost elements were addressed by alternative.
3.8.8.2.1. Frequently, interim calculations for construction, utility, M&R, BAQ/VHA, and other estimates, as well as
adjustments for inflation, need to be made prior to entry into PC-ECONPACK. The methodology used for these interim
calculations can be presented in a table or chart such as the one shown in figure 3.4. Tables and charts can facilitate the
review of the EA for evaluators. It is very important to include the source and any interim calculations conducted for
all estimates and data used in the EA. Therefore, this section shall refer the reader to the appropriate signed source
documents in Appendix C and interim calculations in Appendix D of the EA. Any assumptions which were used in the
derivation of the cost estimate is also reiterated here. For example, the derivation of Annual M&R costs might read like
this:
       Annual M&R costs for the existing housing units were based on historical data provided by the Planning Department
       of the Civil Engineering Squadron (Appendix C). The data were adjusted for inflation to FY95 dollars (Appendix D).
       Annual M&R costs for the Improvement alternative were assumed to be 10 percent less than the Status Quo
       alternative. Annual M&R costs for the Replacement alternative were assumed to be 15 percent less than the Status
       Quo alternative. These assumptions were based on interviews with CE personnel and are documented in the CE
       Source Document dated 29 April 19XX. (Appendix C).
3.8.9. Benefits Analysis. In the EA, the benefits analysis is presented in a separate section. This section explains the
methodology used to develop the benefit score used in the calculation of the cost/benefit ratio. The discussion on benefits
analysis includes:
• An explanation of the methodology and rationale used to calculate the benefit score and weights.
• A description of each benefit category addressed in the analysis and a discussion of the results and rankings of each of
      the alternatives based on the benefit score.
• A chart or table similar to figure 3.9 summarizing the calculation of the benefit score.
3.8.9.1. PC-ECONPACK version 4.0 has added an additional text block which can be used for the benefits analysis
documentation.
3.8.10. Scope Sensitivity Analysis. For the scope sensitivity analysis, the PC-ECONPACK Cost Sensitivity Analysis
should be included in the EA. If the results of any sensitivity analysis indicate a change in the alternative rankings, then
this fact should be highlighted and the implications should be discussed in the EA. Note that the PC-ECONPACK software
will insert the title "Cost Sensitivity Analysis" on this report. This title is hard-coded in the system and cannot be modified
by the user.
3.8.10.1. The analyst addresses the results of this scope sensitivity analysis in the DoD Executive Summary. Specifically,
the summary must indicate whether the ranking of alternatives would change if the number of units were varied by plus or
minus 25 percent. Suggested statements would be:
      "A scope sensitivity analysis for Alternatives X (the initially least cost alternative) and Y (the initially higher cost
      alternative) has been conducted reflecting changes of plus and minus 25 percent of the proposed project scope.
      The results indicate that if the scope of Alternative X increases by 25 percent, the ranking of alternatives will not
      reverse unless the scope of Alternative Y increases by less than ___ percent. Conversely, if the scope of
      Alternative X decreases by 25 percent, the ranking of alternatives will not reverse unless the scope of Alternative Y
      decreases by more than ___ percent. Therefore, within the range of this analysis, the ranking of alternatives
      remains unchanged."
46                                                                                          AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

     (NOTE: If the analysis indicates that the ranking of alternatives reverses, determine where between the limits of
     plus and minus 25 percent this reversal occurs and change the last sentence to: "Therefore, the ranking of
     alternatives reverses with a ___ percent change in the scope of Alternative X.)
3.8.11. Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis. This section should include the PC-ECONPACK printouts pertaining to the
discount rate sensitivity analysis. For the discount rate sensitivity analysis, PC-ECONPACK provides an NPV versus
Discount Rate graph, a summary table from which the analyst can determine whether changes in the discount rate changed
the original ranking of alternatives, and a detailed report listing the NPVs for each discount rate value used in the analysis.
All of these charts and graphs are included in this section of the EA.
3.8.12. Appendices. The appendices of the EA include the following:
• Appendix A - DD Form 1391 for the Improvement alternative. The Military Construction Project Data form for
     improvement of existing housing must be presented, and must include the PACES report illustrating project
     composition.
• Appendix B - DD Form 1391 for the Replacement alternative. The Military Construction Project Data form for new
     construction or replacement of existing housing are presented and include the Tri-Service Cost Model illustrating
     project composition.
• Appendix C - Source Documents. All of the signed source documents and supporting data are presented including the
     name and phone number of POCs.
• Appendix D - Interim Calculations. All of the worksheets used in calculating utility, maintenance, moving,
     BAQ/VHA, and other estimates, as well as inflation/escalation adjustments are presented.

         ENERGY CONSERVATION INVESTMENT PROGRAM/FEDERAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT
                                 PROGRAM (ECIP/FEMP)

4.1. Introduction. This section of the manual provides guidance for the preparation of Economic Analyses (EAs) which
are required as part of the project justification process for projects falling under the Energy Conservation Investment
Program and the Federal Energy Management Program (ECIP/FEMP). ECIP/FEMP are DoD centrally managed programs.
The ECIP is a Military Construction (MILCON) funded program for retrofitting existing Department of Defense energy
systems and buildings in order to make them more energy efficient and to provide substantial savings in operating costs.
The FEMP is similar to ECIP but it uses Operation and Maintenance funds— $300,000 or less for new work, and $3 million
or less for repair type work. All ECIP/FEMP projects require that an EA be performed prior to the project being approved;
FEMP projects require an EA to be submitted to the Air Staff if the expected cost is more than $300,000.
4.1.1. Background. The Presidential Executive Order 12759, issued on April 17, 1991, and recent directives from DoD
have placed renewed emphasis on the energy conservation program. ECIP/FEMP funding levels vary based on
congressional appropriations and current budget constraints. Hence, well-documented and justified energy projects can
assist the Air Force in obtaining ECIP/FEMP funds. The purpose of this guidance manual is to assist analysts in the
preparation of ECIP/FEMP EAs.
4.1.1.1. Public Law 102-486, the Energy Policy Act of 1992,” makes each military service responsible for identifying and
accomplishing all energy conservation measures with a 10-year or less payback. All facility energy conservation
construction projects costing $300,000 or more are administered as MILCON projects.
4.1.1.2. By definition, an ECIP/FEMP project must result in an overall energy cost savings. That is, ECIP/FEMP projects
are proposed to correct inefficient use of energy and reduce operating costs due to that inefficient use. ECIP/FEMP projects
are prioritized on the basis of the greatest life cycle payback as determined by the savings-to-investment ratio (SIR).
Additional consideration can be given to projects that substitute a renewable energy for nonrenewable energy. Figure 4.1
summarizes the 14 types of ECIP/FEMP projects.
4.1.2. Project Coordination. The primary responsibility for performing ECIP/FEMP EAs lies with the Civil Engineering
(CE) staff at the affected organizational level, as can be seen in figure 4.2. Collateral responsibility lies with the Financial
Management (FM) staff and the end user. Therefore, completing the EA requires close coordination between CE, FM, and
the end user of the facility.
4.1.2.1. ECIP/FEMP EAs require approval from the MAJCOM. Hence, it is important that ECIP/FEMP EAs are well-
documented and justified. Figure 4.3 presents the ECIP/FEMP project approval process.
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                               47

   Congress: Approval waiver to statutory cost limits for Improvement project, or approve Replacement project, based on
   justification of the Economic Analysis.
4.2. Defining the Project, Formulating Assumptions, and Identifying Alternatives. The analyst should collect and
review all written documentation available that could affect any project alternatives. This review will include the most
current DD Form 1391 and the attached construction cost estimate for the proposed project, previous EAs, the Base
Comprehensive Plan (BCP), energy studies, and relevant floor plans. Next, interviews are conducted with the personnel
involved with the project planning process and with current facility users. The current facility users are a good source for
identifying deficiencies in the existing facility. All information is collected in writing, including the source of the data, and
the name, organization, title, and phone number of each point of contact (POC).
4.2.1. Other concerns which should be addressed at this time include possible asbestos, radon, or lead-based paint problems
which can cause costly abatement procedures and impact the project schedule. In addition, a facility on the National
Register of Historic Places cannot be demolished and demands unique architectural/engineering compliance requirements
for renovation. These requirements traditionally make renovation more costly and may make enhanced energy efficiency an
impossible or nearly impossible goal.
4.2.2. Defining the Project Objective. From the information collected, a one-sentence description of the proposed project
is developed. A clear, concise project definition is necessary in order to define potential alternatives for the project (called
discrete portions by the LCCID software). Figure 4.4 presents sample ECIP/FEMP project objectives.

Figure 4.4. Sample ECIP/FEMP Project Descriptions.

  Steam and Condensate Systems: Replace 21,000 LM of High Temperature Hot Water Lines (HTHW)
       connecting the central heat plant to the industrial area of the base with a shallow trench system.
  Steam and Condensate Systems: Install two centimeters of insulation on all base steam and condensate
       lines in Warehouses 2 and 3.
  EMCS: Install a new EMCS in 26 buildings, and replace EMCS equipment in 12 water well stations, 6
       water storage tanks, and 10 sanitary pump stations.
  HVAC: Replace existing chillers with new high-efficiency chillers and central plant piping extensions.

4.2.3. Formulating Assumptions. EAs are based on facts and data pertaining to the project in question. However, an EA
deals with costs and benefits occurring in the future. Since the future is unpredictable, assumptions are made to account for
uncertainties. To avoid invalidation or bias of the analysis, assumptions based on realistic assessments or anticipated
conditions should be made only by qualified individuals. Since these assumptions are fundamental to the integrity of the
EA, clarification of the assumptions is an essential part of the EA process.
4.2.3.1. There are several common assumptions made when preparing an EA for ECIP/FEMP projects:
• Economic Life of the Project: The economic life of an ECIP/FEMP project varies for each project type as can be seen
     in figure 4.5. The maximum life cycle is 25 years.
• Salvage Value: The salvage value is the residual value of existing equipment removed as a result of the retrofit project.
     This salvage value is the estimated market value and can be determined by contacting several local salvage yards. The
     information released should be limited to that required to get a fair estimate and should not bias source selection.

• Inflation: In a constant-dollar analysis, costs and benefits are estimated based on the constant purchasing power of the
     dollar. Therefore, inflation adjustments are made only for those cost elements for which price increases are anticipated
     to exceed the general inflation level. However, when historical data is used to estimate future costs, historical costs
     must be inflated to the date of analysis (DOA). This can be performed by CE or FM staff. It is critical that the analysis
     date be indicated on all source documents and in the analysis so that the analyst and reviewers know that the
     appropriate escalation and discount values have been applied. The source and date of the inflation indices must also be
     documented.
• Base Year: A constant-dollar analysis requires that all costs be converted to a common or base year to permit equitable
     comparison of those values. Typically, the project year is defined as the base year for a given EA. The most recent
     NISTIR 4942-2, Present Worth Factors for Life-Cycle Cost Studies in the Department of Defense, is used to obtain
     inflation indices for ECIP/FEMP projects.
• Discount Rate: The discount rate is used to account for the time value of money when comparing the cost of
     alternatives over multiple years. EAs performed to support Air Force ECIP/FEMP projects are priced in constant
     dollars and discounted by a market-based rate that is revised annually. The most recent NISTIR 4942-2, Present Worth
     Factors for Life-Cycle Cost Studies in the Department of Defense, is used to obtain discount rates for ECIP/FEMP
     projects.
• Cost Savings: By definition, an ECIP/FEMP project must save energy; therefore, there will always be an overall energy
     cost savings. Cost savings may include increases in the use of one fuel and a decrease in the use of another. Cost
     savings also include items such as electrical demand savings and operator/maintenance savings. Cost savings are made
     relative to the Status Quo values in the EA.
4.2.3.2. Additional assumptions may be required when project data is unavailable, when future costs are uncertain, or when
a project involves unique circumstances. All ECIP/FEMP submittals will include copies of the life cycle analyses with
supporting documentation showing the basic assumptions made in arriving at projected costs and savings.
4.2.4. Identifying Alternatives. There are typically three potential alternatives to meet an ECIP/FEMP objective:
• Status Quo.
• Retrofit.
• New Construction.
4.2.4.1. The Status Quo alternative is considered the baseline for the EA and is used only to allow calculation of the
project's energy savings. In the case of an ECIP/FEMP project, the Status Quo is the continued use and operation of
existing facilities in their current condition.
4.2.4.2. The Retrofit alternative involves renovating the existing facility to eliminate and/or reduce future energy costs by
reducing fuel consumption or converting to a more efficient fuel. Various levels of improvements can be addressed as
alternatives, including minimal correction of deficiencies (such as recaulking windows) to comprehensive “gut and rebuild”
efforts (such as remodeling interior design to take a thicker insulation standard). This option must also consider any costs
incurred due to construction requirements arising from historical or regulatory demands. The actual work to be performed
is explicitly documented in the EA.
4.2.4.3. The New Construction alternative consists of the construction of a new facility in order to produce an overall
energy savings. If new construction involves replacing an existing facility, then disposal of the existing facility is
addressed. New construction is sometimes cheaper than a retrofit because energy conservation can be built into the facility,
while retrofit may require additional engineering to support the conservation measures. For example, if thicker insulation is
required to meet certain standards, the required space can be part of the design for new construction, while for a retrofit
project, significant renovations may be required. This option must also consider any costs incurred due to construction
requirements arising from historical or regulatory demands.
4.2.4.4. The above-mentioned alternatives are the ones most frequently addressed in an ECIP/FEMP EA. However, the
analyst should always aggressively pursue all possible realistic alternatives since the final decision can be no better than the
available choices. It is not unusual for ECIP/FEMP EAs to address only the Status Quo and one other alternative.

4.3. Data Collection for the Economic Analysis. This section discusses the data collection requirements normally
included in an ECIP/FEMP EA. The costs associated with each alternative under consideration must be quantified and
included in the EA calculations. All costs the facility is expected to incur over the life of each alternative, except sunk
costs, are included in the life cycle cost analysis. Sunk costs are expenditures which are incurred before a project has
received final approval. These costs would not be recovered regardless of the alternative selected. Examples of sunk costs
include: project planning, preliminary design, conducting the energy audit, and preparation of the economic analysis.

4.3.1. Construction and Other One-Time Costs and Savings. Most one-time costs occur early in a project's life cycle.
Construction or retrofit are usually the most significant. However, all one-time costs are also considered.
4.3.1.1. Construction Costs. Since the largest percentage of the project cost is determined by the scope of the Retrofit or
New Construction project, it is imperative that all primary and support costs are included in the EA. Construction or
retrofit costs include site preparation, utilities, roads and pavements, SIOH, and design costs.
4.3.1.1.1. Construction or retrofit costs can be calculated using R.S. Means estimating publications or approved parametric
models such as PACES. When compiling project costs, special attention is given to ensure that all costs associated with a
Retrofit alternative, such as asbestos abatement, lead-based paint remediation, and environmental compliance, have been
considered. Accurate and complete construction or retrofit cost estimates are essential to the integrity of the EA.
4.3.1.1.2. Construction/Improvement costs are thoroughly documented on the DD Form 1391 and attachments. The DD
Form 1391 and attachments for an EA include:
• The project title, project number, and alternative name.
• The scope of the estimate in square meters.
• A brief description of the costing methodology or estimating system used.
• Dated sources for variables, such as area cost factors and escalation factors.
• The base year of the project cost.
• CE Authority signature for the estimate.
4.3.1.1.3. The estimate shows all interim calculations so that the values can be tracked from the source data to the total
project cost appearing on the DD Form 1391 and in the Life Cycle Cost Report. Clear documentation speeds review of the
EA. In addition, a clearly documented DD Form 1391 can be easily updated when the source data changes or when the
project is changed for a different program year.
4.3.1.2. Other One-Time Costs. Accurate assessment and inclusion of other one-time costs are imperative to ensure a
complete EA. Examples of other one-time costs for an ECIP/FEMP project include:
• The moving and storage of furnishings and equipment when the users are relocated.
• Disposal and replacement of furnishings and equipment.
• Temporary contracting out of the requirement.
• Lease payments for temporary off-base space.
• Tenant build-out requirements that involve renovations to temporary space to ensure the space meets the needs of the
     users.
4.3.1.2.1. All attempts should be made to time construction/retrofit activities to minimize the costs associated with the
above items. However, even with the best scheduling attempts, temporary displacement of some personnel, equipment
and/or supplies may occur. This will require either contracting out for the requirement or moving the operations to
temporary space.
4.3.1.2.2. When moving to or from some permanent or temporary space, moving and storage costs will be incurred.
Moving and storage (drayage) costs can be obtained from the base transportation office. The Interstate Commerce
Commission can also provide approximate moving costs based on weight and requirements for cartons and custom-built
crates.
4.3.1.2.3. Lease costs are associated with using off-base facilities on either a temporary or long-term basis. If there is an
existing Air Force lease of similar space, then that lease rate per square meter is used to estimate the lease costs for the
temporary space. If there is not an existing Air Force lease, then the General Services Administration (GSA) lease rates for
the appropriate geographic area are used. Tenant build-out costs, such as partitions, power, and telecommunications hook-
ups, may also be incurred for the temporary space.
4.3.1.2.4. For each temporary building included in a project, separate documentation is required showing a minimum 10-
year continuing need for active building retention after retrofit, the specific retrofit action applicable, and an economic
analysis supporting the specific retrofit. Temporary buildings in ECIP/FEMP projects are documented in the installation's
annual real property utilization survey (AR 405-70).
4.3.1.3. One-Time Savings. The replacement of one system with another may generate a need to dispose of the old
equipment. This obsolete equipment may have some residual value, which can be estimated by contacting local salvage
yards. The salvage value is a credit that is recouped during the construction period.
4.3.1.3.1. In addition, some projects may result in public utility company rebates which would further offset investment
costs. These are moneys that public utility companies give for certain energy conservation improvements, such as
converting to a renewable fuel.
4.3.2. Energy Savings/Costs. By definition, ECIP/FEMP projects must save energy; therefore, there will be an overall
energy cost savings. At least 20 percent of the total discounted dollar savings in the EA should result directly from energy
(Giga joules) savings. Project documentation shall be in metric units in support of goals established under Executive Order
12770 “Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs” dated July 25, 1991. These savings may include increased use of
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                 51

one fuel and decreased use of another. Care should be taken when computing energy savings to ensure that energy savings
are not duplicated between projects or portions of projects. The actual cost of the energy purchased for use at the facility is
used (rather than stock fund prices) as the basis for energy cost analysis. Purchased energy is defined as being generated
offsite. For special cases where electric power or steam is obtained from on-site sources, the actual average gross energy
input to the generating plant is used. For the purposes of calculating energy savings, the conversion factors are presented in
figure 4.6.

     The term "coal" does not include lignite. When lignite is involved, the Bureau of Mines average value for the source
     field is used. When refuse derived fuel (RDF) is involved, the heat value is the average of the RDF being used or
     proposed. When the average fuel oil heating value is accurately known through laboratory testing for a specific
     military installation, that value may be used in lieu of the amount specified above.

4.3.2.1. Additional consideration can be given to projects that substitute renewable energy for nonrenewable energy. Full
energy credit may be taken for conversion from fossil fuels or electric power to solar, wind, RDF, or geothermal energy, less
the calculated average yearly standby requirement.
4.3.2.2. Figure 4.7 presents an example of the methodology used to estimate annual electricity costs and savings for the
Status Quo and Retrofit alternatives based on an area (square meter) basis. Other energy-consuming utility costs can be
similarly calculated. The most accurate estimates of utility costs are available when bases can meter utility usage at the
facility level. Total consumption for the facility can be taken from utility bills or Defense Utility Energy Reporting System
(DUERS) reports. DUERS or WIMS can also provide the necessary area figures. CE is the best source for this data. If
possible, usage rates from 3 previous years are averaged after adjusting them to the base year of the EA. Appropriate
inflation indices can be obtained from NISTIR 4942-2, Present Worth Factors for Life-Cycle Cost Studies in the
Department of Defense.
4.3.2.3. Potential savings estimates can be made based on engineering judgment or by consulting engineering handbooks,
such as ASHRAE Fundamentals. Another possible source is the recorded savings from other facilities on base or other
installations which have already been retrofitted with similar energy conservation measures.
4.3.3. Non-Energy Savings/Costs. Two major categories of non-energy savings/costs are used in ECIP/FEMP EAs. These
categories are as follows:
• Annual Recurring Savings/Cost.
• Non-Recurring Savings/Costs.

                                       _______________________________________

4.3.3.1. Annual Recurring Savings/Costs. The primary component of recurring cost savings is usually maintenance and
repair costs. Maintenance and repair (M&R) costs include both annual and periodic M&R. Annual M&R includes
preventive maintenance, and plumbing, electrical, and minor structural repairs required to ensure a safe and efficient
working or living environment. Annual M&R costs/savings for Retrofit or New Construction alternatives are usually less
than those incurred under the Status Quo alternative. Therefore, the historical M&R cost data are normally adjusted
downward by an assumed percentage (25 to 40 percent, based on engineering judgment) for the Retrofit and New
Construction alternatives. Annual M&R costs over the life of the retrofit or new facility are assumed to increase 10 percent
every 5 years throughout the life cycle of the alternative or until equivalent to the Status Quo alternative.
4.3.3.2. Nonrecurring Savings/Costs. Nonrecurring costs/savings include unscheduled maintenance and repair (M&R)
expenses and expenses that occur on a nonregular basis. Unscheduled M&R includes major repairs to components, such as
replacing the AC motor in an HVAC system. Cost schedules are based on the expected life of the equipment or fixture.
The date the item was last replaced is available from CE for projecting future schedules and costs under the Status Quo
alternative. Renovation and new construction generally begin with all new equipment; hence replacement schedules are
based on the construction date. It is important to remember that scheduled intervals will often vary based on local
conditions. For example, the salt air in marine environments corrodes and shortens the expected lives of exterior
mechanical units while other exterior mechanical units may be damaged in dusty environments.
4.3.3.2.1. Unscheduled M&R costs are estimated based on local prices or by using the cost of any recent replacement of
similar items, including appropriate labor fees. If such cost data is unavailable, commercial source such as R.S. Means or
Dodge Cost Data can be used and documented. Another possible source would be comparative maintenance and repair
cost/ savings from another installation for a similar facility.

4.4. Conducting the Economic Analysis and Analyzing the Results. The purpose of an ECIP/FEMP EA is to determine
the Savings-to-Investment Ratio (SIR) for each alternative or discrete action that is being considered for satisfying the
objective to reduce energy-related costs. The SIR is the ratio of the present value savings to the present value costs of an
energy conservation measure. A SIR of one indicates that the present value of savings is equal to the present value of
investment. All SIR calculations and analyses will be based upon the useful life of the retrofit action, which is 5 to 25 years.
For ECIP/FEMP projects to be considered, a SIR of at least 1.25 is required. The Air Force strongly recommends the use of
Life Cycle Cost in Design (LCCID) to prepare the EA. The National Institute of Science and Technology’s Building Life
Cycle Cost (BLCC) or DISCOUNT programs, developed for more general applications, are also acceptable for use in
generating Economic Analyses for energy conservation projects. However, it should be noted that the BLCC program does
not provide reports formatted consistent with DoD report formats.
4.4.1. Overview of the Life Cycle Cost in Design (LCCID) Model. The Life Cycle Cost in Design (LCCID - pronounced
EL SID’) is a computer program intended to be used as a tool in the evaluation and ranking of design alternatives for new
and existing projects. LCCID can calculate the life cycle costs and other economic parameters for a variety of energy
conservation initiatives in DoD construction. The basic algorithms and reports in LCCID are based on the economic
criteria of the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Defense (DoD) and the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB).
4.4.1.1. The specific criteria and other guidance embodied in LCCID are:
• OMB Circular A-94.
• Code of Federal Regulations, 10 CFR 435.
• Memorandum of Agreement on Criteria/Standards for Economic Analysis/Life Cycle Costing for MILCON Design,
     March 1994.
• DoD Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) Guidance.
4.4.1.2. LCCID is a menu-driven, interactive program which can operate on several types of computer hardware. There is
extensive on-line help to assist the first-time and infrequent users. LCCID is a public domain computer program available
to any requester.
4.4.2. Analyzing the Results. The LCCID EA computer program used for ECIP/FEMP EAs produces a one-page
summary report which is included in the ECIP/FEMP EA documentation. It includes eight parts:
• A summary of investment costs.
• A summary of energy savings.
• A summary of non-energy savings.
• Total net savings.
• Simple payback period.
• Total discounted savings.
• SIR
• First year dollar savings.
4.4.2.1. Figure 4.9 presents a sample LCCID ECIP/FEMP print-out for an EMCS project.

4.4.2.2. The investment section presents the construction cost, design, and SIOH. These values are given in constant
dollars as of the date of analysis. Salvage value is the residual value of existing equipment removed as a result or the
retrofit or replacement project and is subtracted from the investment costs. In some cases, public utility company rebates
will also be provided to the installation.
4.4.2.3. Part 2 presents a table of the energy savings for the given discrete portion. Notice that savings are positive and
costs are negative in this paragraph. Energy prices are always given in dollars per GJ and savings per fuel in GJ per year.
The cost per GJ is the cost of energy at the installation on the date of analysis. For each fuel savings presented, complete
documentation of all interim calculations must be attached to the ECIP/FEMP report to show and substantiate the energy
56                                                                                         AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996

savings claimed. In addition to the fuel types provided in the DOE tables, renewable fuels such as solar energy and PPG
fuels (propane) may be included. The fuels not in the DOE tables are discounted using UPW values for annual costs.
4.4.2.4. Part 3 lists the annual, one-time and other non-energy cost/savings for the given discrete portion. This section
would include savings in M&R or operations.
4.4.2.5. Part 4 is the Total Net Savings per year.
4.4.2.6. Part 5 displays the estimated simple payback period for the project. This is calculated by dividing total investments
by the annualized savings. The next paragraph adds total energy discounted savings to total discounted non-energy
discounted savings to get the total net discounted savings. Dividing the total net discounted savings by the investment costs
yields the SIR. If this number is less than 1.25, the project will be rejected. LCCID will indicate that the project does not
qualify if this ratio is less than 1.
4.4.2.7. Part 8 is the First Year Dollar Savings which is the annualized value of all the energy and non-energy savings for
the project. By definition, “First Year Dollar Savings” is the summation of the first year's energy and non-energy savings.
One-time and non-annual, non-energy savings are converted to an annual value by dividing the total non-energy savings by
the economic life of the discrete portion.
4.4.2.8. It is important to proofread the summary report to ensure that all the data input is correct. The analyst should:
• Check for any typographical errors in the data input.
• Check that cost/savings in fuel use are accurate.
• Check that the construction expenditures match the DD Form 1391 schedule.
• Ensure that the appropriate cost/savings elements have been included for each alternative.
• Ask -- Do the results make sense? Are they reasonable? Are there any surprises?
4.4.2.9. Any errors discovered are corrected and the analysis results are recalculated.
4.4.3. Making Recommendations. ECIP/FEMP projects are selected for inclusion based on two criteria: the savings-to-
investment ratio and the payback period. Projects must have a SIR greater than 1.25 and a discounted payback period of 10
years or less to be considered. Those projects with the highest SIR and the fastest discounted payback should be given
priority.
4.5. Documenting the Results of the Economic Analysis. It is important that an EA be documented to allow complete
replication by reviewers. This section provides guidance on how to compile an ECIP/FEMP EA. An ECIP/FEMP EA
contains:
• DD Forms 1391.
• Economic Analysis.
4.5.1. A sample ECIP/FEMP EA is provided in attachment 5.
4.5.2. DD Forms 1391. The ECIP/FEMP project submittal includes the DD Forms 1391 with the normal MILCON line-
item detail. The DD Forms 1391 contain the notation "ECIP” or “FEMP" at the beginning of the title block and include the
construction cost estimate, a brief description of the project requirements, the current situation, including any impact if the
situation is not changed, and any additional comments concerning the project. Additional comments shall include:
expected dollar savings per year, expected energy savings per year, and simple payback.
4.5.3. Economic Analysis. The economic analysis includes:
• Consideration of alternatives.
• Economic justification summary.
• LCCID ECIP/FEMP Summary Report.
• Savings validation/verification.
4.5.4. The economic analysis is included in Section 11 of the DD Forms 1391. Section 11C is the Consideration of
Alternatives. In this section, a description of each of the alternatives or discrete portions addressed in the analysis is
provided.
4.5.5. Following the Consideration of Alternatives is the Economic Justification Summary (11D). All of the supporting
documentation consisting of basic assumptions and basic engineering and economic calculations showing how savings were
determined are presented here. A list of the documents and data sources used is also provided.
4.5.6. The LCCID ECIP/FEMP Summary Report for each discrete portion is presented as 11E. The conclusion and
recommendations should be documented on the DD Form 1391. Include a statement regarding whether or not the
installation affected by the project is being considered for closure or realignment. If so, provide an explanation for why the
project should still be considered.
4.5.7. The savings validation/verification is presented in section 11F. All ECIP/FEMP projects must include a savings
validation on the DD Form 1391, or they may be rejected. This validation plan includes an accurate assessment of the
project's savings and describes the procedures, methods, equipment, and documentation format that will be used to assess
the efficiency of the new energy saving system. Also, if this is an EMCS project, it must include a signed statement from
AFMAN 32-1089 1 August 1996                                                                                                57

the installation commander stating that appropriate resources will be committed to effectively operate the system over the
life cycle of the investment.

4.6. Revalidation and Preparation of the Annual Report to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
(Logistics). All projects must be revalidated prior to advertising to ensure that the contemplated benefits will still accrue.
Projects may be considered valid if the SIR remains above 1.25. This will ensure that projects funded within the 25 percent
variation allowance still achieve a positive return on investment over the life of the project. However, for programming
purposes, ECIP/ FEMP projects with comparatively low SIRs are less likely to be funded than those with high ratios.
4.6.1. In the event that a project cost estimate changes by more than 25 percent of that furnished to the Congress (the
original estimate attached with the DoD funding document) or the scope is reduced by 25 percent to allow award within the
original estimate, notify the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Logistics) and the DoD Comptroller of the
circumstances causing the change. Contracts or contract modifications may be awarded 21 days after submission to OSD,
provided no objections exist. Contracts or contract modifications may be awarded prior to the 21-day period with OSD
concurrence.
4.6.2. Annual Report. An annual report on the status of the ECIP/FEMP must be provided to the Office of the Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Logistics) by February 15 of each year for incorporation into the Department of Energy’s
report to Congress. This report includes a project status list of all ECIP/FEMP projects for each of the past 5 years
indicating:
• Original approved costs.
• Current working estimates.
• The original and current estimated savings, SIR, and payback periods.
• Whether or not the project has been awarded, completed, canceled, or deferred.
4.6.3. Computer-generated reports in Excel or Lotus 123 are preferred.

Terms

AIRR--The adjusted internal rate of return is the overall rate of return on an energy conservation measure. It is calculated
by subtracting 1 from the nth root of the ratio of the terminal value of savings to the present value costs, where n is the
number of years in the study period.

Alternative--An approach or program that is another possible way of fulfilling an objective, mission or requirement. (This
includes the status quo).

Analysis Period--Normally the construction period plus the shortest economic life of the alternatives being addressed.

Assumption--An explicit statement describing present and/or future circumstances which may affect the outcome of an
analysis.

Base Year--The program year to which all costs are adjusted to permit equitable comparison of dollar values from different
years.

Benefit--A qualitative or quantitative measure of an alternative's effectiveness in meeting program objectives or needs.

Benefits Analysis--An analysis which attempts to quantify the intangible aspects of an alternative that are normally difficult
to assess in an EA. The analysis yields a benefit score which is used in the calculation of the Cost/Benefit Ratio.

Break-even Point--The point between two alternatives at which they are equally cost-effective. It can be determined by
plotting the alternatives' life-cycle costs on a graph.

Build-to-Lease--A program for providing government facilities through private sector development. The government
contracts with a private developer to have facilities built, with a guarantee that the government will lease the facilities for a
certain period.
60                                                                          AFMAN 32-1089 Attachment 1 1 August 1996

Burdened Salary--The true costs associated with paying personnel, including direct salaries, benefits, employer's share of
social security payments, leave and holiday costs and non-cash benefits such as base housing. FMABB contains tables
which include burdened salaries.

Business Case Analysis (BCA)--A tool to assist the Military Treatment Facility executive staff in making decisions
regarding the provision of health care.

Constant Dollar Value--Value, cost or benefits estimated based on constant purchasing power of the dollar.

Cost/Benefit Ratio--Shows the decision maker the degree to which benefits are being attained relative to costs. The
Cost/Benefit Ratio for each alternative is calculated by dividing the net present value by the benefit score.

Cost-Effective Alternative--That alternative which, when compared to all other alternatives, maximizes benefits when costs
for each alternative are equal, or minimizes costs when benefits are equal for each alternative.

Current Dollar Value--Value, cost or benefits estimates including estimates of all expected future price changes.

Discount Rate--The parameter used to translate future costs or benefits into present worth. It is a measure of the time value
of money. Values are derived from OMB Circular A-94, Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit - Cost Analysis of
Federal Projects.

Discounting--The process of using a discount rate to determine the present value of costs and benefits.

Discounting Convention--Method of discounting costs, either at beginning-of-year, mid-year, end-of-year, or continuous.

Discrete Portion--A viable alternative capable of accomplishing the project objectives.

Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP)--The ECIP is a MILCON-funded program for construction investments
greater than $300,000 to existing DoD energy systems and buildings in order to make them more energy efficient and to
provide substantial savings in operating costs.

Economic Analysis (EA)--A systematic approach to the problem of choosing how to use scarce resources. An EA should
provide as accurately and completely as possible a picture of monetary and non monetary costs and benefits associated with
each alternative.

Economic Life--The period of time over which the benefits to be gained from a project may reasonably be expected to
accrue to the Air Force. Useful life is another term for economic life.

Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost--The amount of money which, if paid in equal annual installments over the life of a
project, would pay for the project. It is calculated by dividing the total net present value by the sum of the discount factors.

Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP)--an OSD operation and maintenance funded program for funding energy
conservation projects which repair and/or retrofit existing facilities.

Financial Management Analysis Bulletin Board (FMABB)--the computer bulletin board designed for Air Force cost and
financial analysts. FMABB has standard bulletin board features such as a message system. Updates to cost factors issued
under AFI 65-503, USAF Cost and Planning Factors, are found in the form of bulletins (these factors are no longer printed;

Inflation--The increase over time in costs of goods and services.
AFMAN 32-1089 Attachment 1 1 August 1996                                                                                     61

Investment Costs--Costs associated with acquisition of real property, nonrecurring services, and start-up operation and
maintenance costs. These are usually one-time costs, although they may be spread over more than one year, such as
construction costs.
LCCID--The Life Cycle Cost in Design is an economic analysis computer program used in conducting ECIP EAs.

Life Cycle Cost--The total cost to the government of a facility over its full life, including the cost of development,
procurement, operation, support, and disposal.

Maintenance and Repair (M&R)--Actions taken by CE personnel to ensure that an adequate working or living
environment is provided for occupants. Annual M&R includes those minor repairs that occur on a continual basis, such as
repairing plumbing fixtures and broken windows which usually require the execution of an unscheduled Work Order.
Periodic M&R includes the regularly scheduled replacement of major fixtures and equipment such as HVAC units, interior
finishes, roofing systems, etc. that can be anticipated based on the economic life of the item.

National Register of Historic Places--The official national list of properties worthy of preservation for their significance in
American history, architecture, archaeology, and culture. The Register is maintained by the Department of Interior (DOI).
To qualify for the Register, a property must be professionally determined to meet the Criteria of Eligibility set forth in 36
CFR 60. Actions affecting properties on the Register must comply with Sect. 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966, as amended. Properties not currently on the Register but which meet the eligibility criteria are considered the same
as Register properties.

Operation and Maintenance (O&M)--Activities and costs associated with the routine, recurring aspects of maintaining a
facility. Examples include utilities, custodial services, repainting, and minor repairs.

Parametric Cost Engineering System (PACES)--A PC-based parametric cost estimating system which may be used to
determine the costs of proposed renovation and replacement projects. The previously used system, the Tri-Service
Automated Cost Engineering System (TRACES) is still in being, but is no longer in use by the Air Force.

PC-ECONPACK--A comprehensive software program incorporating EA calculations, documentation, and reporting
capabilities. It is available from the US Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Division, P.O. Box 1600, ATTN: CEHND-
ED-ES (ECONPACK), Huntsville, AL 35807-4301, phone: DSN 788-3389, COMM (205) 895-3389.

Present Value--Allows the comparison of different dollar amounts received or expended during different time periods. It is
the net value of a flow of funds expressed as a single sum. It is calculated by multiplying the net cost figure for each year by
the corresponding discount factor and totaling the results. The Air Force normally uses a mid-year discounting convention.

The formula for mid-year Present Value is:

         Where:                    PV    =   Present Value
                                   FV    =   Future Value
                                     r   =   discount rate
                                    n    =   period (years)

Primary Economic Analysis--Performed when the objective is to change the status quo (present method of operation) in
order to achieve a financial savings to the Government.

Program Year--The fiscal year for which funding is being requested. For the EA, life cycle costs are ordinarily presented in
program or base-year dollars for all alternatives.

Recurring Costs--Expenses such as utilities, supplies, personnel costs and other items incurred on a repeating basis.

Residual Value--The expected value of an asset at any point in time before the end of its economic life.
62                                                                         AFMAN 32-1089 Attachment 1 1 August 1996


Risk--The probability of an uncertain event occurring.

Salvage Value--The estimated market value of selling existing equipment that has been removed as a result of the
retrofit/construction project.

Savings Investment Ratio (SIR)--The ratio of discounted future cost savings (or avoidance) to the discounted investment
cost necessary to effect those savings. A SIR of 1 indicates that the present value of savings is equal to the present value of
investment.

Secondary Economic Analysis--Used to determine which of two or more alternative courses of action would most
economically fulfill an objective or requirement which is not currently being met.

Sensitivity Analysis--Conducted to determine the impact that changes in assumptions or parameters may have on the final
conclusions. A sensitivity analysis should be performed on any cost element in which there is a level of uncertainty
regarding its cost or estimate.

Simple Payback--The estimated time in years required for the cumulative value of energy cost savings less future non-fuel
costs to equal the investment costs of the building energy system, without consideration of future price changes or discount
rates.

Sunk Cost--The sum of past expenditures or irrevocably committed funds related to a project. Such costs are generally not
relevant to economic decision-making as they reflect previous rather than present choices.

Tri Services Cost Model--A model used to estimate new construction costs based on the type of facility, the size of the
facility, the cost per square foot, and the area cost factor.

Weight Point--Used in benefits analysis to rank the relative importance of each qualitative factor being assessed. Weight
points can be whole or decimal values.

PROJECT TITLE : Provide Unaccompanied Personnel Housing
DISCOUNT RATE : 2.80%
PERIOD OF ANALYSIS: 31 YEARS
START YEAR     : 1996
BASE YEAR     : 1996

PROJECT OBJECTIVE : Provide suitable cost-effective housing for
         320 unaccompanied enlisted personnel at Anywhere
         Air Force Base

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED FOR THIS ANALYSIS:

The following alternatives were considered in this economic analysis:

Alternative 1:    Status Quo (Direct Compensation)

This alternative provides funding in the form of Basic Allowance for
Quarters (BAQ) for housing accompanied enlisted personnel off-base.
Upon their arrival on-base, personnel are instructed to seek housing
in the local community and are advised of the amount of BAQ they will
receive each month to help defray the cost of housing.

Alternative 2:    New Construction

This alternative involves the construction of a new 64,000 square foot
(SF) dormitory-type facility. The proposed construction will
accommodate 320 unaccompanied enlisted personnel with a grade mix of
E1 to E4. It will provide personnel with housing conducive to proper
rest, relaxation, and personnel well-being. The facility will be
designed and furnished to provide some degree of personal privacy.
Construction will include reinforced concrete foundation and floor
slabs, structural frame, masonry walls, and sloped metal roof.
Construction will also include room-bath-room modules, laundries,
storage, and lounge areas, demolition, asbestos removal/disposal, and
necessary support.

Alternative 3:   Improvement (Addition)

This alternative involves the construction of five 12,800 SF additions
to existing facilities on-base supporting 320 personnel. The existing
facilities on-base that would be expanded are buildings 223, 225,
229, 231, and 232. Expansion will be accomplished by additions to the
ends of these buildings thereby gaining the necessary total SF. The
addition will provide personnel with housing conducive to proper rest
relaxation, and personal well-being. The addition will be designed
and furnished to provide some degree of personal privacy.
Construction will include reinforced concrete foundation and floor
slabs, structural frame, masonry walls, and sloped metal roof.

          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY REPORT                                     PAGE 002

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED FOR THIS ANALYSIS (cont.):

Construction will also include room-bath-room modules, laundries,
storage and lounge areas, demolition, asbestos removal/disposal, and
necessary support.

ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ANALYSIS:

1. Anywhere AFB will retain the mission to house the 320 unaccompanied
enlisted personnel.

2. The base year of the analysis is 1996, the first year for which
costs differ across the alternatives.

3. The period of analysis is 31 years to coincide with the 30 year
economic life of the facility proposed under the Improvement
alternative, and to allow one year for construction of the additions.

4. The New Construction alternative is assigned a residual value using
a 60 year economic life and straight line depreciation.

5. All non-energy costs developed from historical data have been
adjusted using inflation indices contained in AFR 173-13, USAF Cost
and Planning Factors, Atch 45, 15 Feb 94.

6. The construction time for the New Construction and Improvement
alternatives is one year.

7. All costs are expressed in FY 96 constant dollars to coincide with
the program year.

8. All costs except residual value occur throughout the year and
are discounted using a "middle-of-year" discount convention. The
residual value is discounted using an "end-of-year" discount
convention. The real discount rate is 2.8% (FMABB).

9. Miscellaneous furniture will be replaced every ten years over the
life of the project to coincide with the life expectancy for
furniture (10 years).

10. Appliances will be replaced every fifteen years over the life of
the project to coincide with the life expectancy for appliances (15

NON-MONETARY BENEFITS:

A benefits analysis was performed for each alternative. This benefits
analysis included seven factors which were difficult to assess in monetary
terms for the EA:

   - Health/Safety
   - Aesthetics
   - Adequacy
   - Maintenance
   - Security
   - Accessibility
   - Morale

Health/Safety is a criteria which evaluates the health and safety
environments associated with each alternative. The New Construction
and Improvement alternatives were rated superior to the Status Quo
alternative because the new dormitory will comply with contemporary
health and safety standards.

Aesthetics evaluates the impact of the appearance of the proposed site
and facility under each alternative. The New Construction alternative
will have a positive impact on the aesthetic quality of the base. The
Addition alternative is rated inferior because the additions will
reduce desirable greenspace adjacent to existing dormitories. The
Status Quo alternative will have no impact on the aesthetic quality of
the base.

Adequacy measures the extent to which the facility meets the needs of
the unaccompanied personnel to be housed. The New Construction
alternative is rated superior because the planned room-bath-room
modules including kitchenette meets the current Air Force
requirements. The Addition alternative would not include kitchenettes
due to the constrained floorplates. The low rating for adequacy for
the Status Quo alternative is based on observations of housing
occupied by enlisted personnel off-base.

Maintenance evaluates the ease of maintaining the facility. This
criteria accounts for potential cost savings which are not quantified
and included as life cycle costs. In order to match the existing
exterior closure, the Addition alternative would employ materials
which may require more maintenance than materials planned for the New
Construction alternative. The Status Quo alternative is given a high
score because the Air Force is not responsible for maintaining
private housing off-base.

Security evaluates the ability of the facility to protect the
unaccompanied personnel from threats other than health/safety. The
New Construction and Addition alternatives are rated superior because
they move personnel into the relatively more secure on-base environment.

Accessibility evaluates the location and ease of parking for each
alternative. The Status Quo alternative has a poor rating because the
off-base housing is remote from duty stations and other on-base
74                                                                          AFMAN 32-1089 Attachment 3 1 August 1996

NON-MONETARY BENEFITS (cont.):

facilities. The New Construction alternative would provide parking
immediately adjacent to the dormitory. The Addition alternative would
provide less than optimal parking.

Morale is a criteria which evaluates the impact of the facility under
each alternative to the confidence and discipline of the unaccompanied
personnel housed there. The New Construction alternative is rated
superior because the quality of the units would be high.

Each benefit was ranked in order of importance and assigned a "weight
point." Then each alternative was evaluated on how well the alternative
met the objective. Finally, the weight point was multiplied by the
objective score to produce a benefit value. The sum of the benefit values
is the total benefit score for each alternative.

Total Benefit Score               19.3

The New Construction alternative has the highest total benefit score.

DISCUSSION:

The New Construction alternative has the lowest NPV and is therefore
the most cost-effective alternative. The Improvement alternative is the
second most cost-effective.

The Cost/Benefit Ratios are as follows:
                                      BENEFIT COST/BENEFIT
ALTERNATIVE NAME                           NPV       SCORE        RATIO
------------------------------ ----------- ------ -----------
Status Quo (Direct Compensation) $18,186,067 11.8 1,541,192
New Construction                    $16,236,790 22.0          738,036
Improvement (Addition)                 $20,444,427 19.3 1,059,297

The New Construction alternative has the lowest cost/benefit ratio,
indicating that this alternative is the most desirable means of
achieving the project objective.

Cost sensitivity analysis indicates that the New Construction
alternative would remain the most cost-effective alternative across a
reasonable range of changes in the expense items.

The New Construction alternative is recommended for implementation.

           LIFE CYCLE COST REPORT                              PAGE 012

SOURCE AND DERIVATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS:

1. Construction cost: The construction cost for the New Construction
alternative is based on the DD Form 1391 estimate dated March 15,
1994 and included in Appendix A.

2. Addition cost: The construction cost for the Improvement alternative
is based on the DD Form 1391 estimate dated March 15, 1994 and
included in Appendix B.

3. Annual maintenance and repair (M&R) costs for alternatives
involving construction are estimated using historical average annual
M&R costs of similar existing facilities on Anywhere AFB.

4. Annual M&R costs are escalated using BAM factors.

5. Periodic M&R costs for alternatives involving construction are
based on historical costs for replacement of major subsystems for
similar building types on Anywhere AFB.

6. Periodic M&R for the Improvement alternative includes a 5 percent
adjustment for replacement of subsystems due to the new addition being
attached to an existing facility, which would require workarounds in
order to make replacements.

7. Utility costs are developed from historical averages for similar
building types on Anywhere AFB. Energy-consuming utilities are
inflated using DRI producer price indices.

8. Miscellaneous Operations and Maintenance (O&M) includes trash removal cost
based on historical data for removal by volume and trash production
per person.

                                              NON-MONETARY BENEFITS:

A benefits analysis was performed for each alternative. This benefits
analysis included seven factors which were difficult to assess in monetary
terms for the EA:

     - Health/Safety
     - Aesthetics
     - Adequacy
     - Maintenance
     - Security
     - Accessibility
     - Morale

Health/Safety is a criteria which evaluates the health and safety
environments associated with each alternative. The New Construction
and Improvement alternatives were rated superior to the Status Quo
alternative because the new dormitory will comply with contemporary
health and safety standards.

Aesthetics evaluates the impact of the appearance of the proposed site
and facility under each alternative. The New Construction alternative
will have a positive impact on the aesthetic quality of the base. The
Addition alternative is rated inferior because the additions will
reduce desirable greenspace adjacent to existing dormitories. The
Status Quo alternative will have no impact on the aesthetic quality of
the base.

Adequacy measures the extent to which the facility meets the needs of
the unaccompanied personnel to be housed. The New Construction
alternative is rated superior because the planned room-bath-room
modules including kitchenette meets the current Air Force
requirements. The Addition alternative would not include kitchenettes
due to the constrained floorplates. The low rating for adequacy for
the Status Quo alternative is based on observations of housing
occupied by enlisted personnel off-base.

Maintenance evaluates the ease of maintaining the facility. This
criteria accounts for potential cost savings which are not quantified
and included as life cycle costs. In order to match the existing
exterior closure, the Addition alternative would employ materials
which may require more maintenance than materials planned for the New
Construction alternative. The Status Quo alternative is given a high
score because the Air Force is not responsible for maintaining
private housing off-base.

Security evaluates the ability of the facility to protect the
unaccompanied personnel from threats other than health/safety. The
New Construction and Addition alternatives are rated superior because
they move personnel into the relatively more secure on-base environment.

Accessibility evaluates the location and ease of parking for each
alternative. The Status Quo alternative has a poor rating because the
off-base housing is remote from duty stations and other on-base

NON-MONETARY BENEFITS (cont.):

facilities. The New Construction alternative would provide parking
immediately adjacent to the dormitory. The Addition alternative would
provide less than optimal parking.

Morale is a criteria which evaluates the impact of the facility under
each alternative to the confidence and discipline of the unaccompanied
personnel housed there. The New Construction alternative is rated
superior because the quality of the units would be high.

Each benefit was ranked in order of importance and assigned a "weight
point." Then each alternative was evaluated on how well the alternative
met the objective. Finally, the weight point was multiplied by the
objective score to produce a benefit value. The sum of the benefit values
is the total benefit score for each alternative.

 10. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION
 A three-story structure with reinforced concrete foundation and floor slabs, structural frame, masonry
 walls, sloped metal roof, fire protection, and site improvements. Includes room-bath-room modules,
 laundries, storage and lounge areas, and necessary support.
 Air Conditioning: 120 Tons          Grade Mix: 320 E1-E4
 11. REQUIREMENT: 1,627 PN ADEQUATE: 0 SUBSTANDARD: 1,139 PN
 PROJECT Construct a dormitory.
 REQUIREMENT This is a Level I Commander’s Facility Assessment project. Properly designed
 and furnished quarters are essential for the proper rest and morale of enlisted personnel.
 CURRENT SITUATION: There are currently not enough adequate base dormitories to meet the
 billeting requirements for unaccompanied enlisted personnel. at this installation. There are over 320
 enlisted personnel living off-base due to a lack of on-base quarters. This project will significantly
 reduce the base dormitory deficiency..
 IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Substandard living conditions will persist and the morale, productivity,
 and career satisfaction of the enlisted force will continue to be degraded. In addition, personnel living
 on-base will continue to result in payments for BAQ/VHA allowances.

  ADDITIONAL:
  This project meets the criteria/scope specified in Part II of Military Handbook 1190 “Facility Planning
  and Design Guide.”

  An economic analysis has been prepared comparing the alternatives of new
  construction, improvement, and the status quo. Based on the net present values and benefits
  of the respective alternatives, new construction was found to be the most cost effective over the life
  of the project. Fire protection systems for this project meet new standards established in
  MIL-HNBK 1008B, Fire Protection for Facilities. Cost for fire protection is shown separately since
  this new standard ins not yet reflected in the OSD approved unit cost factor for dormitories.

  The estimates were performed using TRACES. TRACES uses a quantity method of parametric
  estimating. With a minimum of required information (size, building use, etc.), this method uses
  algorithms and default parameter information to establish quantities of materials, labor, and
  equipment and then links these quantities to a current price database (US Army Corps of Engineers
  Price Book). The system also uses location modifiers, i.e., seismic, weather, and climate zones,
  to make the design and estimate site specific. TRACES estimates projects through the use of
  parameters - project requirement, characteristics, and conceptual design.

  TRACES uses the mid-point of the construction project (e.g. June 1994 for a 12 month project starting
  in January 1994) to apply escalation. TRACES uses Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
  escalation tables for Air Force projects. The OMB escalation tables are generally identical to USAF
  Raw Inflation Indices. The baseline for escalation is based on the date of the pricing data (currently
  January 1994) . Both the pricing data and escalation tables are periodically updated.

  As a default, TRACES projects the mid-point of construction as a function of a start date and a
  construction period. The user can instead override this default to enter a mid-point for escalation.
  For this estimate, a mid-point of April 1996 was selected and the estimate is in FY 1996 dollars.

 10. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION
 A 12,800 SF addition to each of the five existing dorms. Includes necessary support.
 Air Conditioning: 120 Tons         Grade Mix: 320 E1-E4
 11. REQUIREMENT: 1,627 PN ADEQUATE: 0 SUBSTANDARD: 1,139 PN
 PROJECT Construct additions for dormitory space.
 REQUIREMENT Properly designed and furnished quarters are essential for the proper rest
 and morale of enlisted personnel.
 CURRENT SITUATION: There are currently not enough adequate base dormitories to meet the
 billeting requirements for unaccompanied enlisted personnel. at this installation. There are over 320
 enlisted personnel living off-base due to a lack of on-base quarters. This project will significantly
 reduce the base dormitory deficiency..
 IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Substandard living conditions will persist and the morale, productivity,
 and career satisfaction of the enlisted force will continue to be degraded. In addition, personnel living
 on-base will continue to result in payments for BAQ/VHA allowances.

  ADDITIONAL:
  This project meets the criteria/scope specified in Part II of Military Handbook 1190 “Facility Planning
  and Design Guide.” An economic analysis has been prepared comparing the alternatives of new
  construction, improvement, and the status quo. Based on the net present values and benefits
  of the respective alternatives, improvement was less cost effective over the life
  of the project than new construction. Fire protection systems for this project meet new standards
  established in MIL-HNBK 1008B, Fire Protection for Facilities.

  The estimates were performed using TRACES. TRACES uses a quantity method of parametric
  estimating. With a minimum of required information (size, building use, etc.), this method uses
  algorithms and default parameter information to establish quantities of materials, labor, and
  equipment and then links these quantities to a current price database (US Army Corps of Engineers
  Price Book ). The system also uses location modifiers, i.e., seismic, weather, and climate zones,
  to make the design and estimate site specific. TRACES estimates projects through the use of
  parameters - project requirement, characteristics, and conceptual design

  Algorithm and default parameter information was developed by preparing takeoffs for each building
  type on the quantity and material type used in typical military construction.

  TRACES uses the mid-point of the construction project (e.g. June 1994 for a 12 month project starting
  in January 1994) to apply escalation. TRACES uses Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
  escalation tables for Air Force projects. The OMB escalation tables are generally identical to USAF
  Raw Inflation Indices. The baseline for escalation is based on the date of the pricing data (currently
  January 1994) . Both the pricing data and escalation tables are periodically updated.

  As a default, TRACES projects the mid-point of construction as a function of a start date and a
  construction period. The user can instead override this default to enter a mid-point for escalation.
  For this estimate, a mid-point of April 1996 was selected and the estimate is in FY 1996 dollars.

PROJECT TITLE:                     FY 95 Replace Capehart Housing Phase 1

PROJECT NUMBER:                    ABCD 123456

OBJECTIVE:                         Provide 64 Enlisted Family Housing Units Meeting
                                   Air Force Standards

PROJECT COST:                      $6,160,000

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:

1.    Status Quo
2.    Improvement
3.    Replacement
4.    Direct Compensation

SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS RESULTS:

The Status Quo alternative is the least costly alternative, yielding an NPV of $2.6 million, compared with $7.2 million for
the Improvement alternative and $7.5 million for the Replacement alternative. The Status Quo alternative is unacceptable,
however, because it does not repair the deteriorating structures and would force Air Force personnel to continue to live in
inadequate housing. Furthermore, the benefits analysis shows that the Replacement alternative would yield the greatest
benefit to Air Force personnel. An evaluation of costs and benefits together by means of the cost/benefit ratio also indicates

ANALYSIS METHOD:

All alternatives were examined using standard Air Force and DoD Economic Analysis techniques and procedures. This
examination conforms to generally accepted cost analysis principles as specified in DODI 7041.3, AFI 65-501 and AFMAN
65-506.

CONCLUSION:

The Status Quo alternative is the least costly alternative, yielding an NPV of $2.6 million, compared with $7.2 million for
the Improvement alternative and $7.5 million for the Replacement alternative. The Status Quo alternative is unacceptable,
however, because it does not repair the deteriorating structures and would force Air Force personnel to continue to live in
inadequate housing. Furthermore, the benefits analysis shows that the Replacement alternative would yield the greatest
benefit to Air Force personnel. An evaluation of costs and benefits together by means of the cost/benefit ratio also indicates
that the Replacement alternative is the most cost-effective alternative. The improvement/ replacement initial cost ratio is
83.0% and there is no prevailing justification to retain the existing units. The sensitivity analysis conducted on the discount
rate shows that the ranking of the alternatives will change if the discount rate goes below 3.20%. The sensitivity analysis
conducted on plus and minus 25 percent of project scope shows no impact on the relative rankings of the alternatives. The
Direct Compensation alternative is not feasible because a 1992 Housing Market Analysis concluded that there is a deficit of
adequate housing for Air Force personnel off base. Therefore, it is recommended that the Replacement alternative be
approved.

 PROJECT TITLE     :   FY 95 Improve/Replace Capehart Housing Phase 1
 DISCOUNT RATE     :   4.50%
 PERIOD OF ANALYSIS:   26 YEARS
 START YEAR        :   1995
 BASE YEAR         :   1995

 PROJECT OBJECTIVE : Provide 64 Enlisted Family Housing Units Meeting
                     Air Force Standards


 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED FOR THIS ANALYSIS:


 ALTERNATIVE 1: STATUS QUO

 These 64 units of Family Housing consist of 34 JNCO 3BR units, 10 JNCO 4BR
 units, 18 SNCO 3BR units, and 2 SNCO 4BR units, which no longer meet
 current living standards. Due to advancing age and continual deteriora-
 tion, these units require extensive maintenance and repair.     These units
 were constructed in 1959, under the Capehart Program, and have had no
 formal renovations.    Kitchens are narrow and dark, and do not provide
 adequate cabinet and countertop space. Additionally, washing machines and
 dryers are located in the kitchens, causing a lack of ample work space for
 household chores. The bathroom tubs are very small and in poor condition,
 there is no counter space around the sinks, and the space between bathroom
 fixtures is extremely limited.      The interior of exterior      walls is
 constructed of uninsulated painted masonry block; interior partition walls
 are inferior grade wallboard. There is poor interior lighting in hallways,
 bathrooms, and bedrooms. The exteriors of these units lack landscaping and
 have no covered patios for protection from the sun. Continuation of the
 status quo will require Air Force members and their families to continue
 living in extremely outdated and unsatisfactory housing. The housing will
 continue to deteriorate with age, resulting in unacceptable maintenance and
 repair and utility costs, and extreme inconvenience to the occupants.


 ALTERNATIVE 2: IMPROVEMENT

 Improvement will include the renovation of all 64 existing Family Housing
 units, maintaining the current rank/bedroom composition, in order to
 alleviate the severe space problems in the kitchen, bathrooms and dining
 areas.    The interior finishes will be upgraded, and adequate lighting
 provided.    Support facilities, such as utility systems, patios, walks,
 parking, privacy fences and landscaping will be upgraded or replaced.
 Construction will be accomplished in three phases over a 12 month period.
 For purposes of this analysis, current residents would move to temporary
 off base housing in 1995, and return approximately four months later upon
 completion of the work.

 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED FOR THIS ANALYSIS (cont.):


 ALTERNATIVE 3: REPLACEMENT

 The Replacement alternative will have the same functional features as the
 Improvement alternative and will      maintain the    current rank/bedroom
 composition. The current 64 units would be demolished and 64 new units
 would be constructed on the same site. These new units will meet or exceed
 all of the current standards for energy efficiency.    Construction phasing
 will be the same as for the Improvement alternative. For purposes of this
 analysis, current residents would move to temporary off base housing in
 1995 and return approximately four months later upon completion of the
 work.


 ALTERNATIVE 4: DIRECT COMPENSATION

 This alternative involves demolishing the existing housing, moving all 64
 families off base, and paying BAQ/VHA for the entire period of analysis.
 Direct compensation is not a feasible alternative as a result of a 1992
 Housing Market Analysis, which concluded that there is a deficit of
 adequate housing in the community to meet Air Force needs.



 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ANALYSIS:

 1. All values are in 1995 constant dollars.

 2. This base will retain the mission to house its       current compliment     of
 military families for the period of this analysis.

 3. Energy adjustments are based on "DRI Energy Inflation Indices".       Other
 cost adjustments are based on "USAF Raw Inflation Indices" (FMABB).

 4.   Discount Rate is 4.5% (FMABB).

 5. The economic life of improved housing is 25 years and 40 years for         new
 housing.

 6.   Residual value will be calculated using Straight Line Depreciation.

 7. Improvement or Replacement will be completed in three phases over a
 twelve month period. Annual M&R costs and all utility costs are estimated
 at 70% of Status Quo annual costs during the construction year (App C-1).

 8. Each family will make two moves during the construction period, once to
 vacate the housing units to permit construction, and         another upon
 completion of construction to re-occupy them (App C-2).

 9. Annual Maintenance and Repair costs will initially be reduced by 15%
 for the Improvement alternative, and 20% for the Replacement alternative
 compared to Status Quo costs (App C-1). Annual M&R costs will then
 increase 10% every fifth year for 25 years.

 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ANALYSIS (cont.):


 10. Status Quo energy consumption will be comparable to 1990-1992             energy
 consumption data, with costs adjusted for inflation (App C-1).

 11.   Electricity costs will be reduced by 35% for the Improvement
 alternative, and 40% for the Replacement alternative compared to Status Quo
 costs (App C-1).

 12.   Natural Gas costs will be reduced by 30% for the Improvement
 alternative, and 35% for the Replacement alternative compared to Status Quo
 costs (App C-1).

 13. Non-Energy   Consuming     Utilities     will     remain   constant     for    all
 alternatives (App C-1).

 14. Moving costs are computed at     maximum weight     allowance for     each grade
 (App C-2).

 15. BAQ/VHA    costs are   estimated at    full BAQ    with dependents     rate (App
 C-3).

 DISCUSSION:


 SCOPE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:

 A scope sensitivity analysis has been conducted for the Improvement and
 Replacement alternatives reflecting changes of plus and minus 25% of the
 proposed project scope. The results indicate that if the scope of the
 Improvement alternative (the initially least cost alternative) increases by
 25 percent, the ranking of the alternatives will not reverse unless the
 scope of    the Replacement    alternative (the    initially higher    cost
 alternative) increases by less than 18.70 percent. Conversely, if the
 scope of the Improvement alternative decreases by 25 percent, the ranking
 of the alternatives will not reverse unless the scope of the Replacement
 alternative decreases by more than 25.37 percent. Therefore, within the
 range of this analysis, the ranking of alternatives remains unchanged.


 CONCLUSION:

 The Status Quo alternative is the least costly alternative, yielding an NPV
 of $2.6 million, compared with $7.2 million for the Improvement alternative
 and $7.5 million for the Replacement alternative.         The   Status Quo
 alternative is unacceptable, however, because it does not repair the
 deteriorating structures and would force Air Force personnel to continue to
 live in inadequate housing. Furthermore, the benefits analysis shows that
 the Replacement alternative would yield the greatest benefit to Air Force
 personnel. An evaluation of costs and benefits together by means of the
 cost/benefit ratio also indicates that the Replacement alternative is the
 most cost effective alternative. The improvement/replacement initial cost
 ratio is 83.0% and there is no prevailing justification to retain the
 existing units. The sensitivity analysis conducted on the discount rate
 shows that the ranking of the alternatives will change if the discount rate
 goes below 3.20%. The sensitivity analysis conducted on plus and minus 25%
 of project scope shows no impact on the relative rankings of the
 alternatives. The Direct Compensation alternative is not feasible because
 a 1992 Housing Market Analysis concluded that there is a deficit of
 adequate housing for Air Force personnel off base.        Therefore, it is
 recommended that the Replacement alternative be approved.

 SOURCE AND DERIVATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS:

 1. Periodic Maintenance and Repair: Status Quo Periodic M&R expenses and
 schedule are based on values reported in CES Source Document dated 30 Oct
 92 (App C-1). These are rescheduled beginning in 1995 for the Improvement
 and Replacement alternatives.

 2. Annual Maintenance and Repair: Status Quo Annual M&R expenses are based
 on values reported in CES Source Document dated 30 Oct 92 (App C-1).
 Initially, Recurring M&R costs are reduced by 15% for the Improvement
 alternative, and 20% for the Replacement alternative. They are then
 increased 10% every fifth for 25 years (Asmp 9).

 3.   Electricity: Status Quo Electricity expenses are based on values
 reported in CES Source Document dated 30 Oct 92 (App C-1).         They are
 reduced by 35% for the Improvement alternative, and 40% for the Replacement
 alternative (Asmp 11).

 4.   Natural Gas: Status Quo Natural Gas expenses are based on values
 reported in CES Source Document dated 30 Oct 92 (App C-1).         They are
 reduced by 30% for the Improvement alternative, and 35% for the Replacement
 alternative (Asmp 12).

 5. Non-Energy Utilities: The costs for Non-Energy Consuming Utilities are
 based on values reported in CES Source Document dated 30 Oct 92 (App C-1).
 They will remain constant for all alternatives (Asmp 13).

 6.   Reconnection Charges: The cost to reconnect various services and
 utilities for families are based on values reported in CES Source Document
 dated 30 Oct 92 (App C-1).

 7. Moving Costs: The cost to move each family is based on values reported
 in the Transportation Source Document dated 25 Oct 92 (App C-2).     Moving
 costs are estimated at maximum weight allowances for each grade (Asmp 14).

 8. BAQ/VHA: BAQ/VHA costs are based on values reported in FM Source
 Document dated 26 Oct 92 (App C-3). BAQ costs are estimated at full BAQ
 with dependents rate (Asmp 15).

 9. Improvement Cost: The construction cost estimate for the Improvement
 alternative is based on the DD Form 1391 dated 15 Aug 92 and attached
 Tri-Service Automated Cost Engineering System (TRACES) Report (App A).

 10. Replacement Cost: The construction cost estimate for the Replacement
 alternative is based on the DD Form 1391 dated 15 Aug 92 and attached
 Tri-Service Cost Model Report (App B).

 11. Residual Value Start: Residual value for the Replacement alternative
 will be computed using Straight Line Depreciation conventions (Asmp 6).
 Investment Start Value is calculated as the total construction cost less
 total demolition costs (demolition + contingency + SIOH) from the DD Form
 1391 dated 15 Aug 92 (App B).

 SOURCE AND DERIVATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS (cont.):

 12. Inflation Indices: Adjustments for inflation are based on the "USAF Raw
 Inflation Indices," and "DRI Energy Indices" (FMABB) (Asmp 3).

 13. Project Phasing: 1995 expenses were adjusted to account for the four
 month non-availability of each housing unit during the construction phase
 (Asmp 7). For constant use items, such as electricity and BAQ, they are
 prorated at 70% of the Status Quo annual costs. For one-time cost items,
 such as moving costs and reconnection fees, they are charged twice. They
 are counted once prior to construction to allow for vacating the housing
 units, and once upon completion of construction to account for movement
 back into the housing units (Asmp 8).

 SOURCE AND DERIVATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS (cont.):


 BENEFITS ANALYSIS:

 An important consideration in determining which alternative to choose is an
 evaluation of the benefits each alternative will yield.           The best
 alternative should be considered on the basis of a cost/benefit analysis.
 Intangibles include those factors which are neither monetary nor otherwise
 quantifiable.   Intangibles are generally difficult to deal with in an
 economic analysis because they lack a common frame of reference from which
 they can objectively be compared.       To   resolve this    difficulty, a
 measurement system has been developed to evaluate the benefits of each
 alternative.

 1. Security/Safety: This benefit is a measure of how well the alternative
 provides for the security and safety needs of our service members.    The
 Improvement and Replacement alternatives were rated superior over the
 Status Quo alternative since the improvements to the units will provide a
 newer safer living environment.

 2. Morale/Retention: This benefit is a measure of the morale and retention
 factors. It takes into account both the esprit de corps that develops when
 service members    live in    close proximity    and the    resulting unit
 cohesiveness. The Improvement alternative will provide a slightly above
 average renovated living area. The Replacement alternative was rated as
 being the superior option since new homes would be constructed.

 3.   Efficiency/Comfort: This benefit measures the       level of    energy
 efficiency of the housing units and their impact on the living patterns of
 occupants. It takes into account the differences between new construction
 and renewal of existing units. The Replacement alternative was rated
 higher than the Improvement alternative as construction material and new
 construction techniques will provide superior energy efficiency, and hence
 a more comfortable environment with less cost. The rating for the Status
 Quo alternative is based on inferior windows, exterior doors and energy
 inefficient appliances which make it very expensive for the service members
 to live comfortably.

 4. Privacy: This benefit measures the worth placed on a family's privacy.
 The Status Quo alternative was rated below-average due to a general lack of
 sound insulation. The Improvement alternative would alleviate some of the
 privacy problems, and so received an average rating.        The Replacement
 alternative received a superior rating because the new insulated walls
 would absorb more noise. The double pane windows will also contribute to a
 quieter and more private home atmosphere.

 Each benefit category was assigned a weighted value             from 1     to 3,     with a
 larger value given to the more important benefits.

 Scores were based on how well each alternative met each benefit criterion
 discussed above. Alternatives that did not meet the criteria were given a
 score of zero percent. Alternatives that provided an optimum solution were
 given a score of 100%. Other alternatives were given a relative score in
 between.

 EXPLANATION OF TABLE USE: FOR ANY NUMBER IN THE FIRST COLUMN, RANKING REVERSAL
 WILL OCCUR IF THE CHANGE IN EXPENSE ITEM(S) FOR THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE FALLS IN
 THE RANGE OF -100% TO THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER IN THE SECOND COLUMN. FOR
 EXAMPLE: FOR A CHANGE OF -37.00% IN THE SELECTED EXPENSE ITEMS OF ALTERNATIVE
 2, ANY % CHANGE IN THE SELECTED EXPENSE ITEMS OF ALTERNATIVE 3 IN THE RANGE
 OF -100% TO -35.94% WILL RESULT IN ALTERNATIVE 3 HAVING A NPV LESS THAN THAT
 OF ALTERNATIVE 2.

      utility sheds, and pavements. Renovate/add interiors to include firewalls, doors lighting, electrical,
      plumbing, heating, floor and wall coverings. Repair roofs, foundations, and garages. Replace
      exterior doors and add air conditioning. Remove asbestos and lead paint. Install fire suppression
      sprinklers.

      PROJECT: Improve Capehart Housing Phase 1. (Current Mission).
      REQUIREMENT: This project is required to provide modern and efficient housing for military
      members and their dependents stationed at ANY AFB, AS. Housing must be upgraded to meet
      current life safety codes and to provide safe, comfortable and appealing living environment
      comparable to the off-base civilian community. This is the first of multiple phases (of undetermined
      number) to upgrade 1,448 Capehart housing units. This project corresponds to part of the Housing
      Community Plan (HCP) designated as “Phase A.”
      CURRENT SITUATION: This project will upgrade housing which was constructed in 1959. All are in
      need of major repair and modernization to meet wholehouse guidelines and current housing
      standards. Kitchens have inadequate space with appliances and cabinets crowded together. Kitchen
      cabinets and countertops are worn and deteriorated beyond the point of reasonable repair.
      Bathrooms have inadequate space, and fixtures are antiquated and in need of replacement.
      Electrical systems do not comply with modern building standards. Insulation and energy conservation
      measures are below standards. Units lack modern interior and exterior appurtenances such as
      patios, weather vestibules, master bedroom baths, breakfast areas, and air conditioning which are
      common features in the local civilian community. Off-street parking is inadequate which causes
      snow removal problems. These units are structurally sound, and with the proposed improvements,
      will provide adequate housing for another 25 years without additional major investment.

    IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED : Air Force members and their families will continue to live in extremely
    outdated, substandard and unsatisfactory housing. The housing will continue to deteriorate with age,
    resulting in inconvenience to the occupants. Without this and subsequent phases of this initiative, repairs
    of these units will continue in a costly, piecemeal fashion with little or no improvement in living quality.
    The housing will increasingly become an embarrassment to the occupants as well as the United States
    Government. Low morale and retention problems can be expected if such conditions are permitted to
    continue.
    WORK ACCOMPLISHED IN PREVIOUS THREE YEARS: None.
    WORK PROGRAMMED FOR NEXT THREE YEARS: None.
    ADDITIONAL: The replacement cost for these housing units is $6,160,000. The cost to complete this
    project is 83% of the replacement cost. This project meets the criteria/scope specified in Part II of Military
    Handbook 1190, “Facility Planning and Design Guide.”

    The estimates were performed using TRACES. TRACES uses a quantity method of parametric
    estimating. With a minimum of required information (size, building use, etc.), this method uses algorithms
    and default parameter information to establish quantities of materials, labor, and equipment and then links
    these quantities to a current price database (US Army Corps of Engineers Price Book 1992). The system
    also uses location modifiers, i.e., seismic, weather, and climate zones, to make the design and estimate
    site specific. TRACES estimates projects through the use of parameters - project requirement,
    characteristics, and conceptual design.

    Algorithm and default parameter information was developed by preparing takeoffs for each building type
    on the quantity and material type used in typical military construction.

    TRACES uses the mid-point of the construction project (e.g., June 1994 for a 12-month project starting in
    January 1994) to establish an average escalation. TRACES uses Office of Management and Budget
    (OMB) escalation tables for Air Force projects. The OMB escalation tables are generally identical to
    USAF Raw Inflation Indices. The baseline for escalation is based on the date of the pricing data (currently
    January 1994). Both pricing data and escalation tables are periodically updated.

    As a default, TRACES projects the mid-point of construction as a function of a start date and a
    construction period. The user can instead override this default to enter a mid-point for escalation. For this
    estimate, a mid-point of April 1995 was selected and the estimate is in FY1995 project year dollars.

    11. REQUIREMENT: 1,448 UN ADEQUATE: 152 UN SUBSTANDARD: 1,296 UN
    PROJECT: Replace Capehart Housing Phase 1. (Current Mission).
    REQUIREMENT: This project is required to provide modern and efficient housing for military members
    and their dependents stationed at ANY AFB, AS. All units will meet whole house standards and are
    programmed in accordance with the Housing Community Plan. Replacement housing will provide a safe,
    comfortable, and appealing living environment comparable to the off base civilian community. This is the
    first phase of an initiative to provide adequate housing for base personnel. The replacement housing will
    provide a modern kitchen, living room, family room, and bath configuration, with ample interior and
    exterior storage and a single car garage. Exterior parking will be provided for a second vehicle. The
    basic neighborhood support infrastructure will be upgraded to meet modern housing needs.
    Neighborhood improvement include landscaping and recreation areas.

      REPLACE CAPEHART FAMILY HOUSING PHASE 1                                                     ABCD 123456
      CURRENT SITUATION: This project replaces Capehart housing units which were constructed in 1959.
      These units are showing the effects of age and continuous heavy use. They have had no major
      upgrades since construction, and do not meet the needs of today’s families, nor do they provide a
      modern home environment. Walls and exterior pavements require major replacement due to the effects
      of age and severe winter weather. Wall insulation is inadequate. Plumbing and electrical systems are
      antiquated and do not meet current standard for efficiency or safety. There are no GFI circuits, and the
      number of outlets is minimal which results in haphazard usage of extension cords. Housing interiors are
      generally inadequate by any modern criteria. Bedrooms are small and lack adequate closet space.
      Bathrooms are small, and fixtures are outdated and energy inefficient. Kitchens have inadequate
      storage and counter space, cabinets are old and unsightly, countertops and sinks are badly worn.
      Flooring throughout the house is outdated. Lighting throughout the houses are inefficient and do not
      meet modern needs. Heating and air conditioning systems require upgrade or replacement.
      IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED : Major morale problems will result since personnel will continue to occupy
      substandard housing. The housing will continue to be occupied until it becomes uninhabitable because
      adequate, affordable off-base housing is not available. The current Housing Market for the base shows
      an on-base deficit. Without this and subsequent phases of this initiative, repairs of these units will
      continue out of necessity, in a costly, piecemeal fashion, with no improvement in living quality. This
      housing will increasingly become and eyesore and embarrassment to the United States Government.
      ADDITIONAL: This project meets the criteria/scope specified in Part II of Military Handbook 1190,
      “Facility Planning and Design Guide.” An economic analysis has been prepared comparing the
      alternatives of status quo operation, replacement, and direct compensation.

utility costs are estimated at 70% of Status Quo annual costs during the construction year.

6. The schedule below shows the frequency of Periodic Maintenance and Repair items for the Status Quo alternative, when
they are next scheduled to be accomplished, and their associated unit costs. The replacement schedule and costs are based
on current maintenance contracts and local information for this type of work. Frequency for each item has been adjusted for
the local area based on historical data. For the Improvement and Replacement alternatives, the frequency and unit cost will
be the same as for the Status Quo alternative; the next due date will be calculated from the construction year.

      10. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION Insulate steam lines throughout the installation
      to reduce energy losses in the 30-year old system. The project will increase efficiency and heating
      capacity of the heating distribution system and will bring the heating distribution system into compliance
      with the Energy Policy Act of 1992.




      11. REQUIREMENT: As Required.
      PROJECT: Insulate Steam Distribution System.
      REQUIREMENT: This project is required to provide more energy efficient heating to installation
      buildings. The current steam distribution system is 30 years old and has numerous leaks. The insulation
      will reduce heating losses due to these leaks. Additionally, the insulation is required so that the system
      is in compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
      CURRENT SITUATION: The system is 30 years old. Steam lines are inefficient due to numerous leaks
      throughout. The system does not comply with the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
      IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: The steam lines will continue to leak steam, and the system will continue
      to be inefficient. Additionally, the system will continue to be out of compliance with the Energy Policy
      Act of 1992.

      SECTION 11 - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
      11C CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES
      Maintain Status Quo
      Insulate Steam Distribution System

      11D ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION SUMMARY
      Life-Cycle Cost Analysts Data Base
      1. Investment costs were calculated using R.S. Means estimating publications. Total investment costs,
      including contingency and SIOH = $401,800.

      2. Energy savings were calculated using various energy conservation publications.

      a. Documents included:
        (1) Architects and Engineers Guide to Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings, DOE, 1979.
        (2) ASHRAE Fundamentals, 1985.
        (2) The 1975-Energy Management Guidebook, published by editors of Power Magazine, McGraw Hill
      Inc., New York, NY 1975.

      b. Distillate fuel oil will not be affected by the project. Initial firing of the boilers uses #2 fuel oil. Firing up
      procedures at the beginning of the heating season will not change.

                  Distillate fuel oil savings = 0

      c. Residual fuel oil (#6 fuel oil) is the primary fuel used in the central heating plant steam distribution
      system.

                  (1) Data base:

                        (a) Boiler data--temperature at 100psi = 338 F
                                                         80psi = 324 F

                        (b) Assume average steam/condensate temperature in the line = 240°to 250°F.

                        (c) To be conservative, assume some of the lost heat from the pipes will find its way to ground
                        level, due to both the large amount of heat lost and the circulation built up by both the
                        temperature gradient and the unit heater blowers. Assume 25 percent of the lost heat is
                        returned to the floor level.

                  (2) Current situation--No insulation on steam or condensate lines in warehouse 2. No insulation on
                  the condensate lines in warehouse 3. The steam line in warehouse 3 does have insulation
                  installed.

      (4) Residual fuel savings = q (bare) - Q (insulated)

          Q(lost) = 31,983.634 MBTU/yr - 2,946.777 MBTU/yr = 29,036.857 MBTU/yr

      Not all heat lost from the pipes will be lost to the facility. Even though the warehouses have high bays, we
      can assume 25 percent of the heat is recycled through the buildings.
      Therefore, Q(lost) = 29.037 MBTU/year * .75 = 21,777 MBTU/yr.
      Considering boiler efficiency of 78 percent, this equates to a residual fuel input equal to 21,777
      MBTU/yr/.78 = 27,919 MBTU/yr.

      Using 1054.8 Joule/BTU, this equals to a yearly residual fuel savings of $29,449 GJ/year.

      11F SAVINGS VERIFICATION PLAN

      The savings that are expected as a result of these initiatives will be verified as follows: First, a baseline of
      energy consumption will be established for several typical metered facilities prior to installation of the
      insulation. This will be done by reviewing past meter readings over the entire year of actual energy
      consumption per square foot for these facilities. This data will then be compared to the new energy
      consumption after the installation of the insulation. True dollar costs and GigaJoule consumption rates
      can then be calculated to show the savings associated with the metered facilities and estimated savings
      can be derived through application of square foot costs/savings to similar facilities which are not metered.
      Once these facilities are metered, the actual readings can be used to verify savings due to the installation
      of the insulation.

                                PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS FORMAT

A preliminary economic analysis is a concise tool for making a recommendation to a decision maker without going through
the effort of a full EA. Preliminary EAs are internal planning tools for installations and commands. The goal is to bring
the benefits of economic analysis to decision making early on in the process without being unnecessarily burdened by the
more demanding requirements of a full EA. In no case may a preliminary EA be substituted for a full EA when a full EA is
required by the provision of this manual. The format suggested below is intended to provide the minimum contents
required for a preliminary EA. It is generally a document of no more than a few pages which must be submitted along with
the required for waiver from economic analysis.

1. Problem Requirement: Provide a brief, clear and accurate background statement about what needs to be addressed,
e.g., 300 unaccompanied enlisted personnel are currently housed in substandard facilities (condition code 3 dormitories).

2. Objective: State the generic need in an unbiased, non-limiting manner, quantified to the extent possible, e.g., provide
adequate housing for 300 unaccompanied enlisted personnel. If “adequate” can be translated into square footage or other
parameters, this quantification should be done.

3. Assumptions/Ground Rules: Identify only the most significant limitations, constraints, assumptions, legal or regulatory
considerations, e.g., all condition code 1 and 2 dormitories are currently averaging 95% occupancy, no present base
organizations will be inactivated or relocated.

4. Alternatives: Identify, as a minimum, the most obvious alternatives. Categorize the alternatives in to groups: feasible
alternatives to be analyzed (e.g., status quo, renovation, new construction, BAQ/VHA), or infeasible alternatives to be
eliminated (e.g., leasing). Include reasons for eliminating infeasible alternatives.

5. Costs: Identify the major categories of costs and include preliminary estimates by major category. “Wash” or common
costs may be excluded (unlike in a full EA). Ignore minor categories of cost or incidental costs. Round total costs to the
nearest $1,000 in keeping with the “rough nature of the estimate, and summarize the differences in costs among alternatives
as a rough order of magnitude. Discounting would only be necessary if cash flows vary significantly in timing. Work to
develop cost estimates with the appropriate base level functional expert, e.g., facility maintenance and new facility
construction costs from civil engineering, number of dorm occupants by pay grade from base billeting office, BAQ/VHA
costs from appropriate Accounting & Finance office. Documentation of costs is not necessary, but check calculations for
accuracy.

6. Benefits: Identify the more important benefits associated with each of the alternatives being analyzed, e.g., renovation
corrects all deficiencies, or opting for off-base housing (BAQ/VHA) results in demolishing old dorms, reducing facility
maintenance and repair workload.

7. Risk Assessment: Identify the key variables which could possibly change to the extent that the recommendation would
change.

8. Conclusion and Recommendation: Briefly explain which alternative appears best and why. Emphasize that the choice
is based on preliminary analysis only and could possibly change based on the results of a complete, formal EA.
