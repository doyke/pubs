SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes are evident in para 2., the addition of the SOWG (para3) and the FB (para 4).
1. Request for Assignment of Facilities. Requests for assignment of facilities will be
submitted by unit or squadron commanders and indorsed by group commanders on Malmstrom
Air Force Base to the Real Property Officer (RPO) (341 CES/CEAOR). Each request will show
accurately the established requirement for each building, facility, or land area, based on current
 2                                                              341MWI32-9001 11 MAY 2010


programming documents, authorized personnel strength, authorized equipment list, and mission
letters or orders (see Attachment 1).
     1.1. Request for buildings will include:
        1.1.1. Current location: type, size (square footage) and use, including floor plan with
        present use,
        1.1.2. Requested location: desired facility or land, type and size (square footage),
        including floor plan with proposed use itemized,
        1.1.3. Justification for relocation or expansion,
        1.1.4. Attach to the space request worksheet a proposed AF 332, BCE Work Request for
        facility modifications needed, including utilities (water, electricity, sewage, etc.), type
        and amount, and safety, fire, communications and security requirements,
        1.1.5. Timeline: estimated time of occupancy.
        1.1.6. Current UMD.
     1.2. Requests for a specific building will, in addition to the above, include the facility
     number.
2. Assignment of Facilities. The Real Property Officer, in conjunction with the Space
Optimization Working Group (SOWG), has the responsibility of presenting the Facility Board
(FB) with their recommendations for proposed space use for organizations assigned or attached
to Malmstrom Air Force Base. Buildings and facilities, including specialized shops, hangars,
test facilities, etc., will be assigned on a priority basis, as much as possible, based on unit
precedence in current volumes of the various programming documents, mission to be
accomplished, and availability of facilities of the desired specifications and locations. Space
allocations will be governed by AFH32-1084, Facility Requirements, and other published Air
Force criteria. When the request for assignment of facilities involves a changed utilization or
conversion, as defined in AFI32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities, and is beyond the
installation commander’s authority, RPO will submit an AF Form 123, Request for Changed
Use of Real Property, to the appropriate approval authorities upon FB approval of said request.
Requests within the installation commander’s authority will be presented to the FB, the minutes
will be used to provide a record of approval or disapproval of each request.
3. Space Optimization Working Group (SOWG). Voting members of the SOWG consist of
one representative from Wing Staff, one representative from each group, the Asset Manager, and
the Base Civil Engineer (BCE) or Deputy BCE. Non-voting members consist of representatives
for the Comptroller, Communications Squadron, Wing Anti-Terrorism Officer (ATO), Fire
Department, Union, and the Real Property Officer. The SOWG will:
     3.1. Meet regularly, as determined by the board chairperson, and become familiar with the
     buildings and facilities located on Malmstrom Air Force Base and its supported installations.
     3.2. Continually review the use of facilities to ensure the fullest and most efficient use of
     available space and assets against the Installation Space Optimization Plan. When feasible,
     use space overages for one function before requesting conversion, repair or alteration of
     existing facilities.
341MWI32-9001 11 MAY 2010                                                                           3


   3.3. Make sure that all surplus facilities are used to satisfy deficiencies, as far as practicable.
   This can include the adaptive reuse concept to optimize functionality.
   3.4. Study and act upon all requests for changed utilization, requests for occupancy or
   vacancy, and conversion of real property facilities. Examine space requests to ensure
   conformance with AFH32-1084, Facility Requirements. Determine the availability of space.
   When two or more organizations make a request for the same facility determine which
   organization has the greatest need and assign the facility to that organization.
   3.5. Carefully screen requirements and existing facilities prior to recommending
   redesignation or conversion of existing facilities to higher headquarters.
   3.6. Screen utilization studies pertaining to the most effective use of existing facilities and
   make a recommendation for the final decision for allocation.
   3.7. Ensure each group representative notifies its organizations of requests that will not be
   submitted to the FB for consideration. The RPO will notify tentant organizations of SOWG
   recommendations.
