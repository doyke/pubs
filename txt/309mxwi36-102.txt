        2.3.1. Ensure Time and Attendance (TAA) Labor Verification Reports are retained,
        along with the approved AF Forms 428 (hard copy or electronic form) at the timekeeper’s

        overtime.
        2.4.2. Authorize overtime for each employee in TAA, prior to the beginning of the
        overtime period. This authorization will be the maximum number of hours approved to

        authorized, if work is completed in less time than originally estimated.
        2.4.3. Consider workload requirements prior to approving all leave requests.
