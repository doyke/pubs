                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Background. The Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) assigned to the 375th
Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) is responsible for maintaining accountability for all
munitions assets that fall under the FV4407 SRAN. Munitions are pilferable and potentially
dangerous in the wrong hands; therefore, strict accountability and control must be maintained.
Organizational commanders are ultimately responsible for the munitions accounts in their unit.
Commanders are highly encouraged to select responsible individuals to act as custodians for
their accounts. Missing or damaged munitions could result in a report of survey investigation.
1.2. Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. The MASO will:
        1.2.1.1. Ensure this instruction is kept up to date with current directives published by HQ
        USAF and HQ AMC.
        1.2.1.2. Maintain strict accountability of all munitions and ensure only authorized
        individuals specified on the AF Form 68, Munitions Authorization Record, Part II,
        Personnel Authorized to Request/Receipt/Submit expenditures for Munitions.
        1.2.1.3. Take immediate action to establish accountability for munitions not maintained
        on record, except for Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Munitions and simulated
        munitions not requested through normal AF supply channels.
        1.2.1.4. Ensure unit commanders and custodians are briefed on their responsibilities.
        1.2.1.5. Notify commanders and custodians of fiscal year (FY) allocations and forecast
        instructions when received from HQ AMC.
        1.2.1.6. Assist in submitting out-of-cycle requests when FY allocations do not satisfy
        mission requirements.
        1.2.1.7. Notify commanders when accounts are not being managed in accordance with
        (IAW) AFI 21-201, applicable supplements, and this instruction.
     1.2.2. Organizational Commanders (using commander) will:
        1.2.2.1. Ensure personnel required to handle explosives complete explosive safety
        training annually in IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
        Contact wing safety, commercial (618) 256-5871/DSN 576-5871, for information on the
        explosive safety-training program.
        1.2.2.2. Ensure munitions operations, 375 LRS/LGRW, is listed on the squadron’s out-
        processing checklists for all munitions account custodians.
        1.2.2.3. Obtain explosive safety license for types and quantities of munitions stored
        outside the munitions storage area, as necessary.
        1.2.2.4. Provide accurate and timely forecasting, adequate storage, proper
        security/control, and custodial responsibilities for all munitions items (including COTS
        munitions) that your organization receive.
SCOTTAFBI21-201 30 JUNE 2010                                                                  5


     1.2.2.5. Ensure allocations are not exceeded. If items on hand exceed allocations, they
     must be turned in immediately.
     1.2.2.6. Provide transportation to pick up and deliver required munitions to and from the
     munitions storage area (MSA). Privately owned vehicles are not authorized for
     transportation of munitions unless an exception is described in AFMAN 91-201,
     Explosives Safety Standards.
     1.2.2.7. Ensure departing personnel transfer account management responsibility to a new
     custodian or turn in all munitions and explosives to the MASO at least 45 days before
     release from duty.
     1.2.2.8. Immediately, screen and remove on-hand/installed munitions items when
     notified of suspended or restricted munitions and take appropriate turn-in actions.
     1.2.2.9. Ensure timely completion of custody account inventories and sign the inventory
     listings.
     1.2.2.10. Ensure timely reports are submitted for any theft, suspected theft, loss, or
     destruction of munitions items to the MASO and applicable authority. Ensure at least
     one account custodian (primary or alternate) is on station to manage custody
     responsibilities for munitions issued to his/her account.
     1.2.2.11. Ensure the turn-in of munitions residue, packaging, and containers to the
     munitions flight for certification or disposition using procedures outlined in Chapter 3 of
     this instruction.
     1.2.2.12. Initiate a formal courtesy storage agreement with the munitions storage activity
     when such storage is required.
  1.2.3. Custodians will, on behalf of the commander:
     1.2.3.1. Monitor on-hand munitions assets to ensure authorized quantities listed on the
     Explosive Safety License are not exceeded.
     1.2.3.2. Ensure accountability and inventory integrity are maintained.
     1.2.3.3. Ensure safety, security, lot number integrity, and accountability of all issued
     munitions are maintained until the assets are expended or turned in.
     1.2.3.4. Ensure an auditable record of all issues, expenditures, and turn-ins of munitions
     items is accurate and up to date when submitted to the munitions flight for
     processing/filing.
     1.2.3.5. Become familiar with responsibilities as outlined in this instruction, AFMAN
     91-201, AFI 21-201, and applicable AMC Supplements. Custodians must be particularly
     familiar with the following areas of AFI 21-201:
         1.2.3.5.1. Munitions Requirements, Allocations and Buy-Budget Process.
         1.2.3.5.2. Unit Allocation Procedures.
         1.2.3.5.3. Use of AF Form 68, Munitions Authorization Record.

       1.2.3.5.6. Custody Accounts.
       1.2.3.5.7. Issues.
       1.2.3.5.8. Expenditures.
       1.2.3.5.9. Turn-Ins.
       1.2.3.5.10. Time-Change Cartridge Actuated Device/Propellant Actuated Device
       (CAD/PAD) Management.
       1.2.3.5.11. COTS Munitions.
       1.2.3.5.12. Deployed Munitions Management.
       1.2.3.5.13. AFI 21-201, Attachment 5, Munitions Customer Information Matrix.
    1.2.3.6. Ensure munitions not issued to them, but in their possession, are immediately
    turned in to the munitions flight.
    1.2.3.7. Report all loss, damage, destruction, or suspected theft of munitions to the
    MASO through their chain of command.
    1.2.3.8. Coordinate munitions forecast for organizational requirements as directed by HQ
    AMC and the MASO.
    1.2.3.9. Prepare all documentation for munitions account.      If assistance is required,
    contact munitions operations.
    1.2.3.10. Report all expenditures within 5 days from the date of expenditure and request
    assets to replenish their stock as required.
    1.2.3.11. Physically inventory all custody munitions quarterly. This step includes
    coordinating with munitions operations to schedule inventory time and date.
    1.2.3.12. Submit location changes, in writing, via e-mail to munitions operations upon
    movement of munitions assets.
    1.2.3.13. All email  traffic related          to   munitions     will    be    sent    to
    FV4407ScottAFBMunitions@ amc.af.mil.
    1.2.3.14. The AF Form 68 is required to be revalidated annually when a new individual
    needs to be added or when the organization changes commanders.
    1.2.3.15. Ensure munitions issued to their account are used only for their intended
    purpose. Munitions will not be given to other accounts/parties not authorized to use the
    munitions on their account. Custodians must know what Category (CAT) Code their
    munitions are authorized.
    1.2.3.16. Ensure munitions signed out on the AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt,
    are identified by munitions custody account number, National Stock Number (NSN), lot
    number, and quantity.
    1.2.3.17. Ensure lot integrity is maintained. Some munitions do not have the lot number
    on the item itself, particularly small arms. Once the munitions are removed from the
    marked container received from the munitions area, there is no way to positively identify
    the lot number. Custodians must track munitions lots of small arms when the munitions
SCOTTAFBI21-201 30 JUNE 2010                                                                 7


     are removed from their original container. Some suggestions are: mark the lot number on
     the clip/container, create a list of numbered clips containing the lot number. It is
     essential that lot numbers of small arms be identifiable if removed from the original
     container. If the custodians cannot positively identify which lot numbers are loaded in
     which clip/container, there is a risk of defective munitions being used. This could result
     in personnel injury or destruction of government property. If the munitions area receives
     a restriction/suspension notice, the affected custodians must be able to turn in the
     particular lot numbers listed on the notice.

          INVENTORY, ISSUE, EXPENDITURE, AND TURN-IN PROCEDURES

2.1. General Requirements.
     2.1.1. To facilitate effective scheduling, the munitions flight will handle all customer support
     on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Any support outside of those days will be handled on a case-
     by-case basis. All computer transactions may be submitted at any time.
     2.1.2. AF Forms 68 must be reviewed at least annually. No transactions will be processed
     against accounts with an overdue review.
     2.1.3. No transactions can be processed against an account that is frozen for inventory. If an
     emergency arises, steps may be taken to assist on a case-by-case basis.
        2.1.3.1. If the date of last inventory exceeds 90 days, the account will be frozen and no
        further transactions authorized until a current inventory is accomplished.
     2.1.4. The munitions flight is closed for 2 weeks during March and September each year for
     semiannual wall-to-wall inventories and a stockpile inspection. No transactions may be
     processed during that time. The group commander must approve any emergency requests.
2.2. Management.
     2.2.1. If the custody account is not managed or maintained properly, the following
     procedures will be accomplished:
        2.2.2. The organizational commander will be notified, in writing, and given the
        opportunity to correct deficiencies within 15 days or the account will be “frozen.”
        2.2.3. The MASO will “unfreeze” the account when identified discrepancies have been
        corrected or may direct assets be turned in.
        2.2.4. If discrepancies are not corrected within 30 days after notification, the group
        commander or equivalent will be notified through appropriate channels for assistance.
        2.2.5. Once an account has been “frozen,” no assets will be issued, expended, turned in,
        or moved until the discrepancies have been corrected.
        2.2.6. Commanders are highly encouraged to complete the delegation of authority letter
        and keep on file in their electronic custody file. This action will designate a
        representative to sign the AF Form 68 and account inventories in lieu of G-Series Orders.
        This will allow transactions requiring commanders’ signature to be processed in their
        absence.
2.3. Inventories.
     2.3.1. Inventories are started at the beginning of each month for accounts due that month.
     Custodians must track inventory due dates and submit issue requests around their account
     inventories. Accounts that have only consumption-issued munitions will not be inventoried.
2.4. Custodians will:
     2.4.1. Schedule, conduct, and document the following custody inventories:
SCOTTAFBI21-201 30 JUNE 2010                                                                  9


   2.4.2. Annual MASO Custody Account Inventory.
   2.4.3. Quarterly Custody Account Inventory.
   2.4.4. Primary Custodian Change Inventory.
   2.4.5. Conduct inventories of all munitions items on the custody account. A working copy
   of the custody account listing (AM507A) and the inventory count sheets will be used to
   conduct the inventory.
   2.4.6. Custodians have 15 days from inventory start date to complete the physical inventory.
   After the inventory is complete, they have 15 days to return the inventory to the munitions
   flight with all required signatures. If that date cannot be met, for any reason, contact
   munitions operations.
   2.4.7. Coordinate a date and time with munitions operations to conduct the annual MASO
   inventory. The custodian will ensure the MASO or munitions personnel sign the count sheet
   along with the custodian for all MASO inventories. The MASO or MASO delegate will sign
   the inventory once completed.
2.5. Custody Account (AM507A)
   2.5.1. All munitions listed on the custody account listing (AM507A) will be inventoried and
   accounted for. Inventories will be conducted as follows:
      2.5.1.1. Annotate the quantity on hand (including munitions accounted for on an AF IMT
      1297 for each line item on the AM427G inventory count sheets. Custodians must include
      quantities of expenditures that were e-mailed to the munitions operations after the
      inventory start date.
      2.5.1.2. Ensure location, NSN, lot number, document number, and quantities annotated
      on the AM427G mirror the AM507A.
      2.5.1.3. Notify the MASO and commander immediately if the quantities annotated on the
      AM427G do not match the AM507A.
      2.5.1.4. Annotate new structure and location on the AM427G as needed. If munitions
      were moved during the inventory, annotate new location on the AM427G. All moves
      will be accomplished in Combat Ammunitions System (CAS) once the inventory is
      returned to munitions operations.
      2.5.1.5. Any munitions on hand, but not on accountable records (custody account listing
      AM507A), will also be inventoried and written in on the inventory count listings.
      2.5.1.6. Provide munitions operations with clear and concise location updates, in writing,
      for all custody assets that have been moved.
      2.5.1.7. Notify the MASO and commander of any discrepancies discovered during the
      inventory immediately.
      2.5.1.8. Hand-carry all completed inventory packages to munitions operations with the

         2.5.1.9. Quarterly and annual MASO inventories require printed name, signature, and
         date of the commander and custodian.
2.6. Issues. There are two types of issues, custody, and consumption. A consumption issue is
limited to those assets consumed or installed within 15 days (i.e., due in for maintenance, time
change, and shop stock.). Consumption issues do not show up on your account listing AM507A.
To ensure supportability and scheduling processes, custodian requests for issues are to be
submitted at least 10 duty days prior to pick up date.
   2.6.1. Custodians are responsible to ensure they maintain adequate quantities of munitions
   on their account. Issue requests submitted less than 10 duty days prior to the pickup date will
   be supported at the MASO’s discretion.
   2.6.2. E-mail issue requests to the munitions organizational account listed in paragraph
   1.2.3.14 Request a pick-up date of Tuesday or Thursday. If another day of the week is

      2.6.3. A formal Courtesy Storage Agreement, Attachment 2, must be obtained when items
      are issued to an account that requires storage in the MSA. Custodians will coordinate
      courtesy storage request at the time of issue when courtesy storage is required. If not
      requested, the assets must be stored by the requesting organization. If the requesting
      organization does not have an approved explosive license, assets will be returned to stock.
      Notify the munitions flight of the NSN, CAT Code, and quantities 24 hours prior to picking
      up courtesy-stored munitions for use.
         2.6.3.1. Courtesy Storage Agreements must be resubmitted by the using organization
         annually.
         2.6.3.2. The munitions flight reserves the right to terminate storage agreements if storage
         space is required for priority mission needs or failure of the custodian to comply with
         these provisions.
   2.6.4. Assets will be signed for within 24 hours of the requested issue date. Items not signed
   for in this time frame will be returned to stock and the issue request will have to be
   resubmitted.
   2.6.5. Organizations that request assets for issue but no longer need and/or refuse the assets
   will notify the munitions flight in writing (e-mail notification will suffice) and provide a brief
   description of the circumstances surrounding the refusal. Commanders will be notified if
   their organizations have numerous refusals within the year and account can be frozen.
   2.6.6. Emergency Issues.
         2.6.6.1. An emergency issue is an unforeseen requirement preventing a unit from
         performing its mission, or when the munitions flight is closed during semiannual
         inventories, and when the munitions item is to be installed/consumed within 12 hours of
         issue.
         2.6.6.2. All emergency requests require a letter of justification signed by the applicable
         group commander. Group commanders may delegate authority to approve and certify
         emergency requests to unit commanders in a formal letter to the MASO.
         2.6.6.3. Emergency issue letters must state:
SCOTTAFBI21-201 30 JUNE 2010                                                                   11


       2.6.6.4. The reason for the emergency conditions to include the directive creating the

       be delivered to munitions operations at the time of issue.
   2.6.7. Signing for and picking up munitions. The recipient will be required to present their
   DD Form 2AF, Armed Forces Identification Card. Note: Personnel picking up property will
   be listed on the AF Form 68 (Part II/III). Other than the commander, only these individuals
   are authorized to receipt for assets.
   2.6.8. The individual will verify documentation matches the property being received. Check
   the NSN, lot number, condition code, and quantity before receipt.
   2.6.9. Responsibility for the safety, security, transportation, and accountability of munitions
   remains with the using organization from the time of issue. This action includes lot
   number/service life integrity.
2.7. Expenditures. Expenditure transactions are processed to relieve accountability of assets
issued to custody accounts. Expenditures will be submitted to munitions operations within 5
duty days of actual expenditure date.
   2.7.1. The custodians and unit commanders must ensure custody-issued munitions are used
   only for their intended purpose and that allocated quantities are not exceeded. Unauthorized
   expenditure of munitions will require a Report of Survey for relief of accountability.
   2.7.2. E-mail expenditures to the munitions organizational account listed in paragraph
   1.2.3.14
   2.7.3. All information for expenditures comes from the AM507A. Custodians must ensure
   they annotate the correct document and lot number on the expenditure report. If your
   expenditure report does not match the AM507A, munitions personnel will contact the
   custodian to resubmit the expenditure report.
2.8. Turn-Ins. Turn-ins are processed to relieve accountability and physical possession of
munitions which are no longer needed, have expired shelf or service life, or are no longer
authorized.
   2.8.1. Custodians will coordinate a date and time with munitions personnel to physically turn
   in munitions.
   2.8.2. The MASO will be the key focal point for all unserviceable/suspended munitions.
   The MASO will inform custodians to immediately turn in munitions assets if directed by any
   Conventional Munitions Restricted Suspended Notices or technical data changes.
   2.8.3. Using organizations will ensure munitions are returned in the original or suitable
   containers to include packing. If the using organization does not have the original/suitable
   container and packing material, they must contact munitions Inspection prior to turn-in of
   assets. All munitions will be segregated and identified by NSN and lot number.

  2.8.4. The munitions in-checker will perform a physical count of all munitions and contents
  of containers with the custodian. If physical count does not match the account AM507A, the
  munitions will not be accepted until the discrepancy is resolved. The munitions in-checker
  will submit an electronic turn-in to munitions operations.

                             ALLOCATIONS/FORECASTING

7.1. Allocations:
   7.1.1. Allocations are authorizations for munitions that are approved by the air staff.
   Allocations are valid for one fiscal year (1 October - 30 September). Approved allocations
   are released to the MASO to pass out to custodians sometime in August. To continue to be
   authorized munitions for the next fiscal year, organizations will forecast, or inform the air
   staff what munitions their account will need. The forecasting time frame is 1 October to a
   date set by HQ AMC Munitions Division (A4) in December.
7.2. Commanders and custodians will:
   7.2.1. Be thoroughly familiar with AFI 21-201, munitions requirements, allocations and buy-
   budget process, and unit allocation procedures sections.
   7.2.2. Request access to the Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMST) to update/validate the
   forecast for their munitions account. Custodians must ensure their forecast is accurate to
   include NSN, quantities, and CAT Code. At the MASO discretion, the MASO can make
   inputs in the AMST for the custodian if requested.
   7.2.3. Be aware of allocation/forecast time frames:
       7.2.3.1. Approved allocations for the next fiscal year from the air staff are sent to the
       MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will release the approved allocations to the MASO for
       distribution to the custodian sometime in August.
       7.2.3.2. 1 October marks the beginning of the fiscal year. Custodians will need an
       approved allocation for the current fiscal year to keep munitions issued to their account
       the previous fiscal year. If there is not an allocation for munitions issued the previous
       fiscal year, these allocations are considered excess munitions. The MASO will contact
       the custodian to discuss the procedures for dealing with excess munitions.
   7.2.4. Know authorization tables from AF Catalog (AFCAT) 21-209, Volume 1, Grounds
   Munitions, and Volume 2, Demolition Munitions, or any other authorizing directive (T.O.,
   AFI, etc.) for the munitions on their approved allocations.
   7.2.5. Ensure munitions issued to their account are used according to the CAT Code
   assigned by the approved allocation. CAT Codes are found in AFI 21-201, Attachment 4.
   CAT Codes can also be found on the AMMO & AMST 84th Munitions Sustainment Group
   web site. Contact the munitions area to gain access to this site.
7.3. Munitions will:
   7.3.1. Forward all messages concerning allocations/forecasting from HQ AMC/A4MJM to
   all custodians.

Terms
AF Form 68, Munitions Authorization Record—Used to establish custody and consumption
accounts, identify personnel authorized to receipt/expend for munitions, appoint primary
custodians and authorize user access to CAS for personnel outside the munitions flight. Only the
organizational commander and personnel listed on the AF Form 68 are allowed to conduct any
transactions for the munitions account. A new AF Form 68 must be accomplished annually,
when an individual needs to be added, or when the organization has a change of commander.
Personnel who leave the organization can be lined off the form by the MASO. Obtain the AF
Form 68 from www.e-publishing.af.mil/.
Combat Ammunition System (CAS)—CAS is the munitions supply automated database and is
accessed through the Air Force portal. Custodians can request access to CAS to obtain the
AM507A Custody Account Listing.
AM507A Custody Account Listing—This account is the munitions equivalent to an equipment
R14 CA/CRL. The AM507A is signed by the custodian and commander. The AM507A only
shows what munitions are currently issued to your account and used in conjunction with
expenditures and inventories.
Air Force Catalog (AFCAT) 21—209, Volumes 1 and 2—AFCAT 21-209 lists tables
authorizing munitions to organizations. Custodians need to be familiar with chapter one and
know what table authorizes their munitions.
Allocation—A munitions allocation is the equivalent to the equipment allowance source code. It
is an approved authorization by the air staff to have munitions on the custodians account. An
allocation authorizes the munitions area to requisition munitions for custodians. The allocation
listing shows all munitions authorized for the custodians account.
Forecast—Forecasting is informing the Air Force munitions item managers what type and
quantities of munitions are required for the following five fiscal years. Custodians must forecast
for each fiscal year to maintain their allocations.
Requirement Category Definitions and Requirement Codes (CAT Code)—CAT Codes
define what your munitions are used. CAT Codes are found in AFI 21-201, Attachment 4. CAT
Codes can also be found on the AMMO & AMST 84th Munitions Sustainment Group web site.
Contact the munitions area to gain access to this site.
Issue—A custody issue is adding munitions to your account AM507A. A consumption issue is
when the munitions will be consumed or installed within 15 days. Consumption issues will not
show up on the AM507A.
Expenditure—An expenditure is when munitions are used for their intended purpose.
Expenditures must be reported to the munitions area as soon as possible, but no later than 5 duty
days.
Turn—In—A custody turn-in is taking munitions off your account AM507A. A consumption
turn-in is due within 15 days of the consumption issue physical pickup.
AFI 21—201—This directive is the “AMMO BIBLE” for munitions supply. The munitions area
operates strictly out of this AFI and the AMC supplement for all munitions supply functions.

AFMAN 91—201—This publication covers explosive safety standards.                Commanders,
custodians, and users of munitions are responsible to adhere to it. AFMAN 91-201 will explain
hazard/class divisions, list stock numbers to order hazard/class division stickers, and what
personnel need explosive training.
National Stock Number (NSN)—A 13-digit number that identifies Department of Defense
supply items, to include munitions. NSNs are listed on the custodian’s allocations and AM507A.
Lot Number—A lot number is like a serial number; it identifies munitions manufactured in a
certain batch. Lot numbers are listed on the AM507A and CAS-produced documents.
Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMST)—The AMST is located on the AMMO & AMST 84th
Munitions Sustainment Group web site. Custodians and munitions personnel update the
munitions forecast in the AMST. Custodians and munitions personnel also acquire allocations
from the AMST.
