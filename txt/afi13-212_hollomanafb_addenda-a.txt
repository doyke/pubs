                 OPERATIONS/WEAPONS DELIVERY PROCEDURES

3.1. Overview. All aircraft will accomplish a clearing/orientation pass at a minimum altitude of
500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) before expending any ordnance on any Holloman Range.
For ordnance to be authorized, an approved WDZ or Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) must be signed
and approved by the ROA and on file. WDZs are aircraft specific and contain drop criteria (See
attachment 3).
3.2. Authorized Ordnance. All ordnance deliveries must be approved by the ROA using the
WDZ footprint program located in the Range Management Office. If the ordnance is not listed
on the community of practice website contact the Range Management Office and the parameters
will be run through the WDZ footprint program. We will advise you if it can be approved on our
range with or without run-in heading restrictions.
   3.2.1. Oscura Range is approved by the ROA for the following: BDU-33 and DM-18 on the
   right range GAF academic target only with a run-in heading of 348 degrees magnetic;
   7.62mm TP/TPT on the left range helicopter door gunnery target area only with restrictions
   per the weapon danger zone footprint; small arms (M9, M11, M16, M4, M203) with non

placed in a binder in the Range Management Office. Unless ordnance is already preapproved in
paragraph 3.2., range users must contact the Range Management Office for preapproval prior to
expending ordnance and munitions on any Holloman Range. Ranges fire danger levels are
accessed by the Range Management Office and restrictions are posted in the wing scheduling
office, ROC and ACC A3AR CoP.
3.4. Laser or Directed Energy Operations. All Holloman Ranges are approved for laser
operations. Directed energy weapons are not authorized on any Holloman Range. Approved
laser eye protection must be worn by all ground personnel on the range whenever laser
operations are in progress.
   3.4.1. Laser Systems. The list of approved laser systems is located on the ACC/A3AR CoP
   under the Ranges folder, and in turn under the Holloman Ranges sub folder.
   https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AC-30
   3.4.2. Airborne. Refer to the list of approved laser systems.
   3.4.3. Ground Laser Operations. All ground laser operations must be conducted from
   approved range manned firing points only. The Range Management Office maintains the
   current Laser Safety Danger Zone (LSDZ) information.
   3.4.4. Directed Energy Operations. Holloman Ranges are not currently approved for
   directed energy weapons.
3.5. Night Operations. All Holloman Ranges are approved for night operations. There is
currently no IR scoring capability for night operations. All night operations are conducted under
class C operations with flight lead control.
   3.5.1. Night Lighting. Oscura Range is the only range equipped with night lighting. Prior
   coordination with the ROC is required if night lighting is required as the lighting is remotely
   controlled from the ROC.
   3.5.2. NVD. NVD operations are approved on all Holloman Ranges and must be conducted
   in accordance with current aircrew training standards.
   3.5.3. Infrared Enhanced Targets. Holloman Ranges do not currently have any infrared
   enhanced targets.
3.6. Unmanned Threat Emitters. Holloman Ranges do not currently have any unmanned
threat emitters.
3.7. Transition Corridor Operations and Range Entry/Departure. All aircraft must receive
clearance from Cherokee Control, UHF 305.5 Primary (P) or 346.7 Secondary (S) to enter the
WSMR complex airspace. Aircraft will normally enter Oscura Range airspace from VR 176
from either the south at Romeo, 33o 18’N 106o 13’W (337o/27 DME Holloman TACAN/WSMR
NRD grid intersection of Romeo and 52 lines); the east at Hills, 33o 26.7’N 106o 03.6’W
(352o/35 DME Holloman TACAN); from the north at Trails, 33o 43’N 105o 57’W (358o/53 DME
Holloman TACAN); or southeast at Capes, 33o 17.25’N 106o 04.0’W (354/24). Aircraft
proceeding from Hills to the Oscura Range holding area will not descend below 15,000 feet MSL
until south of 33o 25’N latitude (WSMR NRD grid line 56). All aircraft will normally exit
Oscura Range to the east at Hills between the north boundary and main range complex above
10,500 feet MSL. Departures via the Sands and Salinas Corridors or through Red Rio Range
may be accomplished provided this is coordinated with and approved by Cherokee. Departing
 18                         AFI13-212_HOLLOMANAFB_ADDENDA-A 15 MARCH 2011


aircraft will maintain Visual Flight Rules (VFR) until clear of WSMR airspace. Aircraft, which
exit east off range and plan to recover at Holloman, will proceed east and intercept the Holloman
357o radial inbound and contact Holloman Approach Control for recovery clearance. Aircraft
exiting east off range and not planning to recover at Holloman may obtain an instrument flight
rules (IFR) clearance by contacting Holloman Approach Control for hand-off to Albuquerque
Center. Aircraft, which exit north through Red Rio Range and wish to obtain an IFR clearance,
will contact Albuquerque Center after departing WSMR airspace.
   3.7.1. Entry procedures for Red Rio Range: Prior to entering Red Rio Range, radio contact
   with Cherokee UHF 305.5 (P) 346.7(S) will be established. Cherokee will issue clearance to
   enter the range. The normal working frequency will be UHF 279.7. Entry into Red Rio can
   be from IR 113, IR 133, VR 176, VR 1233, VR 100, VR 125, holding at Trails, the Sands
   Corridor, or other WSMR areas.
   3.7.2. All aircraft will normally exit Red Rio Range to the east. Departures via the Sands
   and Salinas corridors may be accomplished if approved by Cherokee ultra high frequency
   (UHF) 305.5 (P) 346.7 (S). Aircraft will maintain VFR and depart at appropriate VFR
   altitude. If IMC, obtain an IFR clearance through Cherokee. Aircraft which plan to exit east
   off range and recover at Holloman will exit the range at Canyon, 33o39’N 106o04’W
   (352o/47 DME Holloman TACAN) and proceed to Springs, 33o31.5’N 106o1’W (357o/40
   DME Holloman TACAN). Aircraft will contact Holloman Approach Control 269.225 for
   recovery clearance. Aircraft exiting off range and not planning to recover at Holloman may
   obtain an IFR clearance by contacting Albuquerque Center through Cherokee. Aircraft that
   proceed south along the VFR corridor will contact Holloman Approach Control 269.225 for
   clearances, flight following, and advisories. All aircraft will clear off WSMR with Cherokee
   as soon as practical prior to departing WSMR airspace. Upon exiting the assigned WSMR
   working area, aircraft will not penetrate other WSMR airspace without approval from
   Cherokee.
   3.7.3. Entry procedures for Centennial Range: Takeoff from Holloman AFB Direct to
   Range Entry. Depart Holloman AFB runway 16/22/25 via standard climb-out in accordance
   with (IAW) Holloman AFB Instruction (HAFBI) 11-250. For RW 34 departure, expect
   sequencing and vectors for a southbound routing. For departure from any runway, climb and
   maintain correct VFR hemispherical altitude at or above 11,500 feet MSL. Maintain extreme
   vigilance for civilian and military aircraft operating in the VFR corridor that runs between El
   Paso and Alamogordo. Aircrews entering from a low level Military Training Route (MTR)
   IR 134, IR 192, IR 194 or IR 195 are responsible for adherence to all MTR procedures in
   FLIP AP 1B, and in local instructions. Establish radio contact with ―Centennial Control‖ on
   UHF 252.5. Use extreme vigilance and ensure altitude or geographic deconfliction when
   entering R-5103 from an MTR if other aircraft are already conducting target attacks;
   established in standard range holding; or exiting the range to the northeast.
   3.7.4. Range over flight: R-5103B (SFC-up MSL unlimited) and R-5103C (SFC-up MSL-
   unlimited) comprise the Restricted Airspace associated with the Fort Bliss McGregor Army
   Range. As a minimum, R-5103C must be activated prior to using Centennial Range. When
   either R-5103B or R-5103C is active, no portion of the Fort Bliss McGregor Range may be
   over flown without clearance from Centennial Control. Aircraft cleared for over flight of the
   range area will adhere to all restrictions imposed by Centennial Control. Establish radio
   contact with ―Centennial Control‖ on UHF 252.5. Centennial Control must approve all
AFI13-212_HOLLOMANAFB_ADDENDA-A 15 MARCH 2011                                                  19


  variations or deviations from issued clearances once on the range. When the range is
  ―HOT‖, flight through McGregor airspace is prohibited unless cleared by Centennial Control
  with the concurrence of any aircraft or flight working the range.
  3.7.5. Range Holding: Holding on range is authorized only after receiving range entry
  clearance from Centennial Control and if coordinated with the aircraft already operating on
  range. The standard range holding pattern is outbound on the Holloman 125 degree radial
  between 15 and 22 DME using left turns, 45 degrees of bank, at or above an altitude of 9,500
  feet MSL. Holding altitude may be adjusted if coordinated between aircraft using the range.
  3.7.6. Aircraft recovering VFR to HMN will make every attempt to contact Holloman
  Arrival Control on 335.625 after checking out with Centennial Control and prior to departing
  R-5103 airspace. Aircraft should exit R-5103 airspace north of NM State Highway 506
  (east-west gravel road, approximately 10 miles north of the town of Oro Grande) and then
  proceed direct to Arrington Tanks (HMN 142/08) at or above 8,500 feet MSL maintaining
  correct VFR hemispherical altitude. If aircraft are holding on range at the standard hold
  altitude of at or above 9,500 feet MSL, maintain 8,500 feet MSL during range exit.
  Holloman Arrival Control will provide descent clearance and sequencing into the Tower
  pattern or vectors for an instrument approach as requested by pilot or flight lead. NOTE:
  Use extreme vigilance for aircraft operating in close proximity to HMN especially aircraft
  executing standard climb-out for RWY 16 and aircraft turning crosswind on RWY 16, 90 to
  initial if on RWY 34, or downwind in the tower pattern. Aircraft unfamiliar with local
  airspace operating procedures and desiring an expeditious VFR recovery to Holloman AFB
  should establish contact with Holloman Arrival Control on 335.625 prior to departing R-
  5103 airspace for vectors and sequencing. Aircraft desiring an IFR recovery to HMN will
  make every attempt to contact Holloman Approach Control on 269.225 after checking out
  with Centennial Control and prior to departing R-5103 airspace. Aircraft will exit R-5103
  airspace to the northeast at or above 10,500 feet MSL maintaining correct VFR
  hemispherical altitudes and proceed to FITZZ(HMN 093/20). Advise Holloman Approach of
  intentions (east recovery, instrument approach, etc.) and expect an IFR clearance at 13,000
  feet MSL to FITZZ for requested recovery. NOTE: Use extreme vigilance for aircraft
  arriving from the east at or above 13,000 feet MSL
  3.7.7. Aircraft exiting VFR southbound will exit R-5103 airspace south of NM State
  Highway 506 (east-west gravel road, approximately 10 miles north of Oro Grande) at or
  above 10,500 feet MSL (maintaining correct VFR hemispherical altitude) and proceed south
  via the VFR corridor. Contact Holloman Approach Control 269.225 prior to exiting R-5103
  airspace (if able) for traffic advisories. While in the VFR corridor, remain west of and within
  2 NM of the north-south rail line until abeam the Newman Tacan EWM Channel 71. Do not
  fly east of the railroad prior to EWM as hot missile firing are conducted in restricted airspace
  on both sides of the VFR corridor. Flight above 12,500 feet MSL in the corridor is
  recommended for ease of radar identification and safer deconfliction. Contact El Paso
  Approach Control abeam the town of Oro Grande. NOTE: Use extreme vigilance for
  civilian aircraft operating VFR in the corridor.
  3.7.8. Priority test missions in WSMR airspace will prohibit range crossings. AIRCRAFT
  SHOULD NEVER COUNT ON CROSSING WSMR AIRSPACE. Contact CHEROKEE
  prior to departing Fort Bliss McGregor Range airspace to coordinate crossing WSMR
  airspace. Aircraft will not penetrate WSMR airspace without approval from CHEROKEE.

3.8. Helicopter Operations. Helicopter operations may be conducted on all Holloman Ranges
under flight lead control using visual flight rules. The left range on Oscura Range and all of Red
Rio and Centennial Ranges are approved for LZ operations at the aircrew’s discretion. Oscura
Range has an approved helicopter landing pad on the east side of the range compound, this pad is
available 24/7.
3.9. Weather. Current local area weather is available through Cherokee Control. Current
weather for each range is available through the Range Operations Center (ROC) at 575-572-5716
(DSN prefix 572).
3.10. Minimums and Fouls. Not applicable, all Holloman Ranges are class B/C ranges with no
RCO’s.
3.11. Emergency Procedures.
   3.11.1. Emergency Airfields. In the event of an in-flight emergency over any Holloman
   Range aircrews are encouraged to recover directly to Holloman AFB.
   3.11.2. Dropped Object and Inadvertent Release. Dropped objects within the weapons
   danger zones will not affect normal range operations. Aircrews may proceed with their
   training mission unless the release causes any problem with the aircraft. At the completion
   of the mission the flight lead should contact the Range Management Office and report the
   incident. Any off range release must be reported to Cherokee/Centennial Control as soon as
   possible. Cherokee/Centennial Control shall then report the incident to the Range
   Management Office. Aircrews must record the altitude and coordinates of the release and
   attempt to mark the impact coordinates if at all possible. In the event that a live weapon
   (HE) is inadvertently released the flight lead must immediately notify Cherokee Control and
   provide the altitude and coordinates of release and then attempt to mark the impact
   coordinates if at all possible. Cherokee Control will then notify the Range Management
   Office.
   3.11.3. Hung Ordnance and Unsafe Gun Procedures. If on final, recover the aircraft and
   fly straight ahead until the gun stops firing. Attempt to keep as many impacts as possible
   within the range weapons danger zone area. After recovery, safe all switches. If other than
   on final aim toward an uninhabited area and immediately safe all switches. If recovering at
   Holloman, recover using hung bomb route to straight in approach on Runway 22/25 and de-
   arm in arm/de-arm Golf.
   3.11.4. Jettison Procedures. These procedures are not intended to deny aircrews the option
   of immediate jettison if, in their judgment, retention of external stores will jeopardize aircraft
   control or aircrew safety. The external stores jettison area for Red Rio and Centennial Range
   is the airfield runway. Jettison passes will be controlled by the flight lead and performed in
   accordance with technical order procedures. For controlled jettison, the aircraft will overfly
   the runway at a safe separation altitude and jettison the stores over the runway. The Red Rio
   and Centennial Range jettison area will be used for inert and training ordnance only. Live
   ordnance will be jettisoned on the Red Rio Range live target (213) only.
   3.11.5. Range Fires. The Range Management Office will assess the wildland fire
   conditions and assign the Fire Danger Rating and associated restrictions for the ranges IAW
   the HAFB Wildland Fire Management Plan and it will be posted on the daily wing flying
   schedule. In the event of a fire on any Holloman range the fire shall be immediately reported
AFI13-212_HOLLOMANAFB_ADDENDA-A 15 MARCH 2011                                                21


  to the ROC when the ROC is operational. During times when the ROC is not operational the
  fire shall be reported to Cherokee. All fires within the range fire breaks will be allowed to
  burn themselves out. The ROC shall monitor all fires on the range task cameras and follow
  procedures outlined in the ROC Procedures Manual. Aircrews will cease firing operations
  unless instructed to continue by the Range Management Office, over flight may continue at
  aircrew’s discretion. Any fire that starts outside the range fire breaks will require fire
  suppression operations by trained fire suppression personnel. The range will be immediately
  closed to all laser and ordnance drops and over flight will be prohibited below 3,000 feet
  AGL. On Oscura Range when the range is manned during class B operations the assigned
  wildland fire suppression personnel will suppress all range fires, inside and outside the fire
  breaks. When the range is unmanned fires within the fire breaks will be allowed to burn
  themselves out. Oscura will be closed during fire suppression operations and over flight will
  be prohibited below 3,000 feet AGL.
  3.11.6. Emergency Medical Services (EMS). In the event of a vehicle accident or medical
  emergency contact the ROC when the ROC is operational, when the ROC is not operational
  call 911 on your cell phone. The ROC will follow procedures as outlined in the ROC
  Procedures Manual. State the nature of the emergency, location and render first aid as
  applicable. When Oscura is manned during class B operations there is at least one New
  Mexico licensed emergency medical technician (EMT) on duty to respond to accidents and
  medical emergencies on and within the areas around Oscura Range and Red Rio range.
  WSMR Stallion Fire Station has an ambulance and EMT’s on duty with approximately a 45
  minute response time to Oscura and 60 minute response time to Red Rio. Lincoln County
  EMS will respond to highways 380 and 54 North. For highways 54 South and 506 and
  Centennial Range the Otero County Sheriff’s Office E-911 dispatch center will dispatch
  county emergency services personnel with approximately a 30 minute response time. Air
  ambulance service is available from Alamogordo and may be requested through the Otero
  County Sheriff’s Office E-911 dispatch center, GPS coordinates are required when
  requesting air ambulance services.

                   RANGE CONTROL OFFICER RESPONSIBILITES

5.1. Responsibilities. There are currently no RCO’s on any of Holloman’s ranges. The civilian
Range Operations Officers (ROO’s) are responsible for overall ground safety for all Holloman
ranges and determining WDZ/SDZ footprints. The military ROO is responsible for all aircrew
safety issues for Holloman’s ranges.
5.2. Checkout and Certification Procedures. There is no current requirement for RCO’s on
Oscura Range as it was converted from a class A range to a class B/C range.
5.3. Range Control Officer (RCO) Scheduling. Not applicable.
5.4. Notification and Transportation. Not applicable.
5.5. Range Opening. Ranges will be opened for class B operations by the Range Operations
Center (ROC). The ROC will ensure the Weapons Impact Scoring System (WISS) scoring
system and all radio communications systems are operational within 15 minutes of opening the
ROC. Any system outages must be reported to the Range Management Office as soon as
possible and any follow up status reported on a daily basis. A security sweep of all ranges will
be accomplished during the opening and 15 minutes prior to each scheduled mission utilizing the
task cameras.
5.6. Range Schedule. The range schedule will be electronically posted on the large screen
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitor in the ROC and updated as required during the day
whenever the Wing Scheduling Office sends out an update.
5.7. Aircraft Control. Aircraft will be controlled by Cherokee/Centennial Control at the White
Sands Radar Facility.
5.8. Range Fouls. Not applicable.
5.9. Ground Party Control. Cherokee/Centennial Control has overall authority for all ground
parties entering Red Rio and Centennial Range and the weapons danger zones on Oscura Range.
The ROC is the focal point for monitoring ground parties on range. All personnel requesting
entry onto any Holloman Range must receive a ground user safety briefing through the Range
Management Office. Exception: Range maintenance personnel who work directly for the ranges
will receive an annual range safety briefing. All ground parties must be scheduled through the
Wing Scheduling Office. For Oscura Range the access road to the range compound, flank tower,
the range compound, helicopter pad, access road to the target holding area/munitions residue
storage area are all within the range safety areas. Access to the left or right ranges must be
scheduled through the Wing Scheduling Office. All ground parties must have radio contact with
the ROC.        Exception:    JTAC teams may use direct radio communications with
Cherokee/Centennial Control when available. The ROC (when operational) will monitor all
ground parties on range. In the event of any emergency on range the ROC will contact the
appropriate response agency IAW the ROC Procedures Manual. Range operations and
maintenance vehicles will utilize an overhead flashing warning light anytime they are within a
weapons danger zone area. All vehicles entering any weapons danger zone area must have radio
communications with the ROC. Exception: Emergency vehicles responding to a designated
 24                          AFI13-212_HOLLOMANAFB_ADDENDA-A 15 MARCH 2011


emergency on range must have radio communications with their dispatch center and coordinate
entry/departure through Cherokee/Centennial Control.
5.10. Restricted Operations. The ROO’s will oversee all restricted operations on the ranges
and ensure range users are in compliance with all pertinent range safety guidance.
5.11. Strafing Operations. Oscura Range is approved for helicopter side fire strafe using
7.62mm on the left range helicopter strafe targets only. Firing direction of 275 through 45
degrees restriction must be strictly adhered to. No other Oscura targets are approved for strafe.
Red Rio Range is approved for high angle and tactical strafe on all targets with no firing
direction restrictions. Centennial Range has one approved scorable low angle strafe target (target
155). The low angle strafe target run-in heading is 210 + or – 10 degrees True Track. High
angle and tactical strafe are authorized on all other targets with the exception of the LSTSS target
area. High angle and tactical strafe attacks must be oriented to avoid hitting any tower
structures.
5.12. Range Visitors. All range visitors requesting to enter Red Rio or Centennial Ranges must
coordinate their request through the Range Management Office and receive a ground user safety
briefing. Personnel not familiar with our ranges or range operations must be escorted on the
range. There is a perimeter traffic gate on the Centennial access road located at Horse Camp
which will remain locked during periods when the range is open. All visitors and maintenance
personnel must receive authority to proceed past this point either from the HAFB Range
Management Office or Fort Bliss McGregor Range Control. This gate will remain opened
during weekends when the range is closed per the BLM memorandum of agreement so ranchers
can tend to their cattle. There are signs posted around the Red Rio weapons danger zone outer
safety boundary. All maintenance personnel and Department of Defense (DOD) personnel
requiring entry into this area must receive authority to proceed through the HAFB Range
Management Office. All deliveries entering the Oscura Range compound must report in to
building 9000 and must remain in the designated safety areas at all times. All Special
Operations, JTAC, security forces and law enforcement personnel requesting use of the left
range village area must have their respective team chiefs receive the tactical ground user safety
briefing through the HAFB Range Management Office. Any visitor requiring entry onto the left
or right range must receive a ground user safety briefing through the HAFB Range Management
Office prior to going to Oscura Range and be on the schedule through the Wing Scheduling
Office. All visitors not familiar with range operations must be escorted onto the range, no
