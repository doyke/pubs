Introduction_______________________________________________________i


      Volume 5, Medical Material, Qualification Training Package (QTP) contains modules on
maintaining stock levels, issue and turn-in of supplies, maintaining supply/equipment
publications and records, storing dangerous and flammable items, conducting inventories,
managing aspects of user maintenance, and aiding in preparation of budget and financial
requirements. This QTP is designed to enhance 5- and 7-skill level OJT of dental laboratory
personnel. The 4Y0X2 Career Development Courses may be used to compliment the training
references listed in each module. All QTPs are intended to be used by trainees, trainers,
supervisors, and task certifiers. Before initiating any training you should review your
responsibilities—as a supervisor/trainer—for conducting on-the-job training (OJT) per AFI 36-
2201, Volume 3, Air Force Training Program On The Job Training Administration.

      Six months after the apprentice graduates, you should receive a survey that allows you to
evaluate the in-residence apprentice course. This poll is a valuable tool, your feedback is critical
to improving our 3 level course and your career field. Subsequently, 3-skill level training
provides a foundation for your OJT

       QTPs are designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training. Once you begin
upgrade training you are required to use the QTPs. QTPs provide continuity to the trainee’s
upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes: 1) General Dental Laboratory
Experience; 2) Fixed Prosthodontics; 3) Treatment and Orthodontic Appliances, Complete and
Removable Partial Dentures; 4) Dental Laboratory Administration; 5) Medical Material; and 6)
Supervision and Training. The QTP modules were written to assist you in preparing for and
conducting training. You must use the QTP modules for training when the STS task is a core task
(minimum qualification for the specialty). Each module segments the major tasks into teachable
elements. Your goal is to provide enough training and guidance so trainees can do all task
related steps, without assistance, and produce an appliance that meets local requirements for
speed and accuracy. QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated
performance. If you have local training requirements not covered by a QTP module you should
develop “steps in performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those
tasks.

      Accompanying each volume of QTPs is a qualification training progress record. This
QTP record serves as a document to record the date the trainee completes each module. Every
person in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP progress record filed in their OJT
folder. Use and annotation of this progress record is similar to current OJT documentation.
When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP performance
checklist, you must document each task completion date in the “date completed” column in the
QTP progress record. If a person is being recertified on a task that is supported by a QTP you
must use that module to complete the recertification process. You should file the QTPs in an
accessible location.

       Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then, evaluating
performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed in the QTP
module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half of each module,
(i.e. steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is considered a standard
Introduction_____________________________________________________ii

and cannot be altered. You may train each QTP volume/module in any sequence; however,
when conducting training use an organized and methodical approach. This will reduce your
training time and enhance your efforts.
       For effective use of this QTP, conduct training in the following manner:
           1. Review the procedures in each module with the trainee.
           2. Direct the trainee to review the training references listed to prepare for task
               performance.
           3. Review the steps in task performance with the trainee, allowing enough time to
               adequately train each step (some modules may take longer to teach).
           4. Evaluate the trainee’s work at each critical step—using the performance checklist
               at this point will be helpful.
           5. Fifth, evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any areas for
               improvement.
           6. Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you must document
               and initial both the STS and the QTP progress record. If the trainee does not
               accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until the trainee successfully
               completes the task.

      The QTP project goal of the 381st Training Squadron, Sheppard AFB TX, is to publish a
useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to write-in changes or revisions
to the QTPs. A corrections/improvements letter is located on the last page of each QTP volume.

         by earliest expiration date first
     5. Label shelves with the stock number, item name, maximum level, and reorder point

     11. Stock levels are established for the items used on a recurring basis and maintained on
         the shopping guide
     12. Levels will be adjusted based on your ordering history; it is best if orders are
         consistent you control your stock levels manually, ask medical supply to print a Using
         Activity Stock Status Report
     13. This report will list how often you ordered items on a recurring basis, show the daily
         demand rate, and a suggested shopping guide level (SGL)
     14. You can choose to use the suggested level, raise, or lower it; levels will remain the
         same until you choose to change them
