     required, must be approved by the 9 PSPTS commander and/or the Pressure Suit Depot manager.

5.3. Preflight Physical. A preflight evaluation will be accomplished prior to each high flight. The eval-
uation will at a minimum include the following: temperature, blood pressure, and an ENT review. A brief
24-hour history of the aircrew member’s health will also be recorded. This history will include the
amount of sleep of the aircrew member and the food eaten prior to reporting to 9 PSPTS for the flight.
Prior to training missions, this interview may be given by an aerospace physiologist or qualified physio-
logical support personnel. Should any question arise as to the aircrew member’s medical condition, the
flight surgeon on call and the mobile officer will be contacted immediately.

5.4. Denitrogenation. Physiological support personnel will ensure that aircrews are dressed, tested and
denitrogenated on 100 percent oxygen for a minimum of 60 minutes prior to scheduled launch of high
flights. The launch supervisor must pass on oxygen prebreathing start times to the mobile pilot prior to
engine start. Denitrogenation times will be closely observed. Deviations in scheduled prebreathing start
time will be annotated on the flight sheet and reported to the mobile officer prior to engine start. Preb-
reathing is not required for low flights.
     5.4.1. The 100% oxygen pre-breathe may be performed in conjunction with mild exercise to enhance
     denitrogenation. The procedures used must be approved by the chain of command and supervised by
     9 PSPTS personnel.
     5.4.2. If the crew member does not complete prebreathing requirements prior to takeoff, document
     the flight sheet and report it to the mobile pilot. It must also be reported to the commander/superin-
     tendent, Operations and Logistics Flight, and on-call flight surgeon as soon as possible. The 9 PSPTS
     commander will then brief the Operations Group commander. At forward operating locations (FOLs),

                                         TEMPORARY DUTY

6.1. General. The 9 PSPTS commander is responsible to ensure personnel are available to support all
UTC taskings.

6.2. Logistics Flight Commander/Flight Chief Responsibilities. The Logistics Flight commander/
flight chief is responsible for the management and assignment of TDY personnel to all FOLs and contin-
gency operations.

6.3. Tour length. Normally the TDY tour length to all detachments is 60 days, excluding travel time.
Contingencies and national tasking will be as directed by the tasking authority. Every effort will be made
to rotate personnel every 90 days.

6.4. Selection Process. Selection of personnel to fill TDY positions will be made by the Logistics Flight
commander/flight chief and approved by the 9 PSPTS commander. Criteria used to select personnel to fill
TDY positions will be the return date from last deployment. This does not include short TDYs (less than
30 days).

6.5. TDY Credit. TDY credit for rotational purposes will be given for mission support TDYs of 30 days
or more. This includes PME and formal training schools (over 30 days). A separate roster will be main-
tained for all TDYs less than 30 days.

6.6. TDY Exemptions and Exceptions. The 9 PSPTS commander is the approval authority for TDY
exemptions. Exceptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Personnel may at any time request that
they be allowed to go TDY instead of being waived under these guidelines. The following general guide-
lines are provided:
   6.6.1. A flight surgeon must confirm medical exemptions. Duties-not-including-flying status does
   not constitute physical profile change for TDY status. Member will retain last return date and may be
   susceptible to a TDY immediately after completing the deferment. If a member was scheduled for a
   TDY location and becomes medically exempt for that TDY, every effort will be made to reschedule
   them for that same location as soon as the physical profile has been lifted.

6.7. TDY Preparation Actions. Personnel selected for TDY are responsible for completing all required
actions prior to departure from home station. Personnel will be required to complete the out-processing
checklists prior to final out-processing at PRU. On the day of departure, personnel will sign out by calling
the detachment coordinator or in person at 9 PSPTS. If the detachment coordinator is not available, leave
a message on the Logistics Flight answering machine.

6.8. TDY Return Actions. Members must report to the Logistics Flight on the next duty day immedi-
ately following their return from TDY. During this duty day, members are responsible for completing all
TDY in-processing requirements. Following completion of these requirements, the Logistics Flight will
officially identify the next day as the first day of member’s compensatory time off entitlement.
20                                                                         ACCI11-459 26 AUGUST 2004


     6.8.1. Trip reports and Letter of Evaluations (LOEs) are mandatory from supervisors and strongly
     encouraged from technicians returning from any TDY, airshow or contingency. They will be filed
     with the detachment coordinator on the first official duty day after return from TDY. It will then be
     routed through the squadron and reviewed by the 9 PSPTS commander. The report will include but
     not be limited to the following topics: purpose of trip and inclusive dates, travelers, personnel, facili-
     ties, billeting support, equipment, tours, operations, vehicles and other comments.
ACCI11-459 26 AUGUST 2004                                                                                 21


                                               CHAPTER 7

                                   DETACHMENT MANAGEMENT

7.1. General. The management of all detachments, FOLs, contingency operations and launch and recov-
ery commitments is the responsibility of the deployed supervisor.

7.2. Detachment Management. Management at the forward operating locations is the responsibility of
the senior-ranking detachment supervisor. They must ensure complete physiological support for
high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. They are also responsible for all physiological support equipment,
personnel and resources under their control.
   7.2.1. The supervisor must ensure all personnel are properly in-processed and out-processed through
   the OL’s orderly room. All personnel must have their OJT folders checked and a safety briefing must
   be conducted and documented in the training records. OJT folders will be taken TDY unless waived
   in writing by the gaining commander. Contact supporting records managers as required to approve
   retention and disposition of records.

7.3. Chain of Command. While deployed, the physiological support personnel will be assigned to the
deployed flying squadron director of operations.

7.4. Changeover Responsibilities. The incoming and outgoing supervisors will perform a complete
inventory of equipment. This inventory will be documented and a copy will be kept on file at the detach-
ment and a copy will be forwarded to the detachment coordinator.

7.5. Equipment Use. Equipment rotation is important to distribute wear and use evenly. The supervisor
is responsible to ensure the correct equipment is flown, write-ups have been cleared and adequate time is
left on the equipment to complete the mission.

7.6. Flight Debriefing. The supervisor should conduct the pilot debrief, ensuring any pertinent informa-
tion is gathered on any equipment problems. If there has been a problem with 9 PSPTS equipment that
interfered with the successful completion of the mission or interfaces with other aircraft systems, the
supervisor will attend the pilot debrief with maintenance.

7.7. Flight Data Sheet Processing. After review of all flight data sheets, supervisors must ensure all dis-
crepancies are noted and the work distributed to the appropriate individual responsible for the repair. All
write-ups should be completed as soon as possible. File all flight-related paperwork and annotate all other
pertinent information to corresponding sheets no later than 1 duty day following the flight. Contact sup-
porting records managers as required to approve retention and disposition of related paperwork and other
pertinent information.

7.8. Evasion Charts. Evasion charts are obtained from the intelligence officer. The maps are placed in
the seat kit cushions as needed for the missions flown. Remember to remove these maps prior to shipping
a seat kit to Beale.

7.9. Fire Department Training. Fire departments at OLs require aircraft emergency extraction training.
Normally this training is requested by the fire department at least once a quarter. If a request has not been
22                                                                       ACCI11-459 26 AUGUST 2004


received, notify the appropriate chain of command that will contact the local fire department to arrange
the training.
     7.9.1. As a minimum, all detachment supervisors must be trained in this procedure. All training must
     be annotated in the OJT training record or six-part folder.
     7.9.2. This training should also be given to local agencies that might be involved in recovery of a
     pilot.

7.10. Suit/Pilot Extraction Training. A video, instruction guide and Kevlar scissors are required at all
detachments. This training must be given to search and rescue teams who might be involved in recovery
of a pilot.

7.11. Physiology Support Vehicles. The 9 PSPTS pilot transport vans may be used as emergency
response vehicles. An example would be to drive a crew member with DCS to the dive chamber. It
would, however, be better to use a rental van or emergency response vehicle for this if one were available.
It should not be used for anything else but physiological support.

7.12. Supply. Detachment supervisors are responsible for ensuring that there is a 60-day supply of parts,
equipment, tube food and sports drinks on hand.
     7.12.1. You may order parts not available through the OL supply section from 9 PSPTS. If you do
     this, you must include on the weekly message the part number, part nomenclature and technical man-
     ual reference, to include page number. Tube food will be ordered from Beale.
     7.12.2. Sports drinks, water, washing powder, bleach, dryer sheets and other necessities may be pur-
     chased through the local commissary. If this has not been established, it is up to the detachment super-
     visor to initiate this procedure. Work through your chain of command for assistance.
     7.12.3. Shipping Pilot Suits: Pilot suits are shipped by Federal Express. If both suits are shipped,
     pilots must hand carry their low-flight helmet due to the length of time it takes for transportation to
     Beale. The only time that the low-flight helmet and mask may be shipped with the suits is when the
     pilot is going on leave immediately after the TDY. Any deviation to this requires the pilot to receive
     approval from the DO. Annotate this on the packing list. Hazardous declarations must be accom-
     plished in accordance with appropriate directives. Include TCNs on the weekly message to 9 PSPTS.
     7.12.4. Shipping survival gear. When shipping survival kits and parachutes to Beale, fill out a DD
     Form 1149, ensure removal of all location-specific equipment, and label the box accordingly. TMO
     will print out the Shipper’s Declaration form and take it from there. Make sure you get a TCN number
     for the DD 1149. Pass the TCN number on to Beale in the next weekly message.
     7.12.5. Shipping Documentation. DD Form 1149 will be completed for all shipments of equipment.
     Accomplish five copies of the DD Form 1149. One copy will be placed inside the container and a sec-
     ond copy will be placed on the outside of the container. If the shipment is to be hand-carried, a copy
     is given to the courier (the courier will sign the DD Form 1149). One copy goes to supply and a copy
     is faxed to PC. Maintain and dispose DD Form 1149 copies in accordance with the official Air Force
     Records Disposition Schedule (WebRIMS) at . Contact supporting records managers as required to
     approve retention and disposition of these items.
ACCI11-459 26 AUGUST 2004                                                                                23


   7.12.6. Equipment Status and Inventory: The detachment supervisor is the custodian for all equip-
   ment. Each supervisor is responsible for completing an inventory within 7 days of arrival at the OL,
   and for single supervisor locations, an inventory upon their departure.

7.13. Low-Flight Helmets and Oxygen Masks. Inspection of low-flight helmets and oxygen masks will
be conducted in accordance with all applicable directives. Personnel must be trained and certified to per-
form this inspection. If there is a lack of equipment or facilities do not meet the minimum standards to
perform these inspections, other arrangements must be made. This can be accomplished with a host-ten-
ant agreement with a local life support shop. At no time will low-flight helmets and masks be allowed to
fly without current inspection dates.

7.14. Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL). All equipment must be calibrated and
current before use. Arrangements must be made either locally or elsewhere to have equipment requiring
PMEL calibration. The only item calibrated outside the local area is the 4140 calibration kit. It is the
supervisor's responsibility to ensure equipment is calibrated in accordance with directives and has current
inspection dates.

7.15. PRC-112 Series Radios and Code Loader. Survival kits will be reconfigured to accommodate the
radio and spare battery at the OL. Make certain the AFTO IMT 338, Survival Kit Record, reflects the
serial number of the installed PRC-112. The AFTO IMT 95, Significant Historical Data, must reflect
that the kit has been reconfigured with the PRC-112. It must also include the serial numbers of the
PRC-90 that was replaced. A PRC-112 loader is required for uploading the codes into the radios. Person-
nel who will be uploading codes must be trained and certified to perform the task.

7.16. Evolved-Gas Decompression Sickness. Procedures outlined in Chapter 5, paragraph 5.10, should
be followed. Local procedures must also be established. The flight surgeon will be the key to the success
of the treatment. Because of the remote detachment locations, effort must be made to inform the 9 PSPTS
command staff.
   7.16.1. Transportation. Transportation to a treatment facility must be planned in advance and memo-
   randa of agreement will be locally drafted with coordination through the 9 MDOS/SGOAF, 9 PSPTS,
   and the USAF Hyperbaric Medicine Center, USAFSAM/FEH, Brooks City-Base TX. Phone numbers
   for the USAF Hyperbaric Medicine Center are listed in paragraph 5.10.1.2.2.
   7.16.2. Emergency Evacuation Hyperbaric Stretcher (EEHS). For the pilot who has developed DCS
   (or arterial gas embolism/AGE) at detachments serviced by an EEHS and a trained provider/operator
   hyperbaric treatment team, the EEHS should be used to initiate hyperbaric oxygen therapy and, if war-
   ranted, transport the affected pilot to the nearest approved medical treatment facility. As in other sit-
   uations, supervising physicians should consult with the USAF Hyperbaric Medicine Center and
   coordinate treatment accordingly.

7.17. Staff Assistance Visits. The 9 PSPTS quality assurance section will schedule a staff assistance visit
once a year. The purpose of this visit is to ensure OLs are meeting minimum acceptable standards and are
following the 9 PSPTS detachment operating instruction. This visit will also serve as an opportunity to
provide assistance on matters of importance to each OL. A two-person team will perform the visit at a
time that is convenient for the location and 9 PSPTS. Reports will be filed at the OL and a copy will be
24                                                                     ACCI11-459 26 AUGUST 2004


routed to the 9 PSPTS commander. Contact supporting records managers as required to approve retention
and disposition of reports.

7.18. Message Traffic. A weekly message will be completed and sent by close of business on Monday
evening. Messages may be e-mailed or faxed to the equipment logistics technician and the PSPTS Logis-
tics Flight commander/flight chief. Maintain and dispose the message in accordance with the official Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (WebRIMS) at . Contact supporting records managers as required to
approve retention and disposition of these items.

7.19. Recall Rosters. Supervisors are responsible for providing a current recall roster to the director of
operations and the PSPTS detachment coordinator.

7.20. Trip Reports. Before departing, ensure a copy of all trip reports are filed at the OLs. Maintain and
dispose of reports in accordance with the official Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (WebRIMS) at
Contact supporting records managers as required to approve retention and disposition of these items.

7.21. Facilities. The detachment supervisor is the facility manager for the 9 PSPTS section and all related
rooms unless otherwise directed. The supervisor will ensure that the 9 PSPTS element is clean.

               EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES AND TRACKING

8.1. General. HARMS equipment is designed to sustain aircrew members during flight and to provide
environmental protection in any survival situation resulting from bailout, crash landing or ditching. The
mission and environment of the high-altitude aircraft require special equipment to provide maximum pro-
tection on a global basis.
   8.1.1. 9 PSPTS provides within ACC field depot functional activity for all physiological support
   equipment, including equipment and procedures standardization. All 9 PSPTS personnel must main-
   tain constant surveillance over aircrew life support equipment and initiate deficiency or hazard reports
   IAW appropriate directives. Physiological support problems will be coordinated with HQ ACC/SGP
   for resolution. HQ ACC/SGP will coordinate with ACC/DOTO, AC2ISRC/C2RR and WR-ALC/LR,
   as required.

8.2. Maintenance and Inspection of Physiological Support Equipment:
   8.2.1. All high-altitude aircraft physiological support equipment will be maintained, inspected and
   repaired in accordance with applicable technical orders and manuals and other related physiological
   support equipment directives. The following will be accomplished:
   8.2.2. All physiological support equipment inspections and equipment location will be tracked using
   the computer-based PSPTS 2000 Information Management System. Hard-copy records must still be
   maintained. Contact supporting records managers as required to approve retention and disposition of
   the records.
   8.2.3. Maintain a current index, technical order, technical manual and publication file for all high-alti-
   tude aircraft life support equipment. The 9 PSPTS commander will maintain equipment accountabil-
   ity in accordance with applicable directives. Contact supporting records managers as required to
   approve retention and disposition of accountability records.

   Orders (TCTOs) and inspections required on all high-altitude aircraft physiological support equip-
   ment.
   8.2.5. Maintain applicable AFTO inspection forms on file for record/control purposes. Equipment
   may be identified with a locally assigned number in addition to the manufacturer’s ID number to aid
   in maintaining accountability.
   8.2.6. Parachute/fabrication personnel will accomplish all inspections requiring inflation testing of
   life rafts in accordance with applicable technical orders.
   8.2.7. Only physiological support personnel are authorized to install and remove survival kits and
   parachutes in high-altitude aircraft and to perform preflight connections and postflight disconnections
   of high-altitude physiological support systems.
   8.2.8. Physiological support personnel will use locally developed checklists for all equipment inspec-
   tions and cockpit hookup of physiological support systems. The 9 PSPTS commander or designated
   representative will review forms and checklists at least semiannually. Records will be kept to docu-
26                                                                       ACCI11-459 26 AUGUST 2004


     ment compliance. Contact supporting records managers as required to approve retention and disposi-
     tion compliance documentation.
     8.2.9. NCOs with a 7-skill level or higher will be assigned to the quality assurance section. As man-
     ning dictates, selected 5-level personnel may be authorized to perform this task if designated in writ-
     ing by the 9 PSPTS/CC.
     8.2.10. Beale Form 356, Inspection Data Timeline, will be used for all high-altitude aircraft equip-
     ment items where flying time, downtime or use time is maintained. Accumulated time continues on
     all equipment after overhaul. The periodic inspection time will be restarted after each inspection.
     8.2.11. AFTO IMT 95, Significant Historical Data, will be kept on equipment to reflect significant
     historical data; i.e., TCTO compliance, bootie or face seal replacement, visor change, etc. It will also
     be used to record routine periodic, annual and 24/36-month inspections. Adjustments, repairs and
     condition of the equipment item will be noted on the AFTO IMT 95 at each inspection interval.
     8.2.12. High-flight data sheets will be used for each flight to reflect all equipment used. These sheets
     will be retained in accordance with the Air Force Disposition Schedule, then forwarded to the USAF
     Pressure Suit Depot (Beale) for disposition.
     8.2.13. Checklists for maintenance inspections will be kept until the equipment is due factory over-
     haul. Contact supporting records managers as required to approve retention and disposition of reports
     of checklists.
     8.2.14. The inspection and maintenance of survival kit equipment will be recorded in the Aircrew
     Life Support Management System (ALSMS) or the appropriate AFTO forms.
