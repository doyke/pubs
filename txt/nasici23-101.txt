1. GENERAL INFORMATION
     1.1. Overview.
     1.2. LGL is the NASIC focal point for non-information technology (non-IT) purchases,
     deployment equipment, temporary storage, vehicles, and equipment accountability for
     NASIC. LGL manages the non-IT purchase process using the NASIC Form 11, Request for
     Purchase-Service-Repair as the primary tool to document and track the requirement through
     acquisition. LGL manages all aspects of individual deployment equipment issue to ensure
     NASIC airmen have all equipment listed on reporting instructions. LGL manages and
     operates temporary storage with the primary mission of staging IT and projects for use
     throughout NASIC. The NASIC/LGLW branch chief is the NASIC Vehicle Control Officer
     (VCO) responsible for overseeing and managing the NASIC fleet of vehicles. Last, LGL
     provides professional supply oversight, assistance, and training for NASIC’s non-IT
     equipment custodians. LGL is the liaison with the 88 MSG/LGR and all NASIC
     organizations to ensure NASIC equipment custodians are compliant with the USAF
     equipment accountability program.
     1.3. Procedures.
        1.3.1. Submit all purchase requests other than IT through LGL. LGL will complete
        requisitions via normal supply channels or Government Purchase Card (GPC) processes.
        Submit purchase requests on NASIC Form 11, Request for Purchase-Service-Repair,
        (available on the LGL Share Point site). Requester’s resource advisor (RA) ensures
        funds are available before request is submitted. Equipment custodian accounts establish
        specialized categories of equipment for groups and directorates. Squadrons appoint
        equipment custodians to maintain accountable property. LGL is the liaison between the
        88 LGR and NASIC. Accountability for Foreign Materiel (FM) equipment will be
        maintained within the Foreign Materiel Equipment Tracking System (FMETS).
2. ACQUISITION
     2.1. Methods of Acquiring Property.
        2.1.1. Submit requests on the local established NASIC Form 11 to unit custodian. The
        custodians will then forward/e-mail the request to NASIC/LGL organization box for
        purchase. LGL will then acquire property directly through base supply, base contracting,
        use of the GPC, or Non-MILSTAMP requisition from GSA, DLA, or ALC’s.
        2.1.2. LGL will assign a GPC holder and a local Purchase Order (PO) number to the
        requested order. The approving official determines the item type. Based on this
        determination, it is the equipment custodian’s responsibility to ensure the property
        identified as R14 or R15 on the Item Type is picked-up on their Custody
        Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) or Organizational Visibility Listing.
        2.1.3. Approving Official emails custodian, applicable RA and the GPC holder notifying
        an assigned PO has been established and the GPC holder is the custodian’s POC.
NASICI23-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                 3


     2.1.4. GPC holder processes the GPC request and emails custodian of the order status to
     include the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD).
         2.1.4.1. GPC holders perform follow-up action on orders after the initial EDD, then
         again after the follow-up EDD.
  2.2. Individual Deployment Equipment Issue. LGL accounts for individual deployment
  equipment issue requirements on the locally established ACCESS data base or ‘Post-post” on
  an AF Form 538, Personal Clothing and Equipment Record.
     2.2.1. LGL personnel outfits the deploying member with the equipment listed on the
     reporting instructions. If the equipment cannot be procured prior to the member’s
     departure date, LGL will provide an equipment shortfall letter to the member. LGL will
     mail the back ordered equipment to the members forwarding address once LGL has
     acquired the members equipment.
         2.2.1.1. LGL provides the equipment required for deployment training listed on the
         reporting instructions from the AEF website or official communication from training
         location.
         2.2.1.2. LGL provides the equipment required for the deployment location listed on
         the reporting instructions from the AEF website or official communication from the
         deployed location.
     2.2.2. All other individual equipment issue is accounted for on AF538 procedures for
     purchase of this equipment follow 2.1 of this instruction.
3. PROPERTY HOLDING AREA
  3.1. Materiel Handling Section.
     3.1.1. LGL is the NASIC focal point for receiving, storing, inspecting, moving, and
     delivering of all supplies and equipment throughout NASIC facilities. Materiel Handling
     Section will completely check all packages during the receipt process. LGL inspectors
     are authorized to accept supplies, equipment, and services for NASIC and perform
     quality control for these items. The supervisor will schedule all pickup of materiels.
     LGL maintains two main types of storage areas: InTransit Property Area (IPA) and
     Temporary Storage Area (TSA).
     3.1.2. In-Transit Property Area (IPA).       Materiel awaiting turn-in or disposition
     instructions is stored by LGL.
     3.1.3. Temporary Storage Area (TSA). The TSA is used for storing research and
     development materiel for anticipated use. Unless a substantiated future requirement is
     validated, the maximum period for temporary storage is 6 months.
         3.1.3.1. An extension request must be submitted in writing to LG for approval to
         have property remain in temporary storage. If space becomes limited and no
         extension was requested, LG will send a notification to the end user commander
         notifying them the materiel will be processed as excess materiel. The property is then
         turned in within 7 duty days.
         3.1.3.2. Work centers may maintain working stocks in the work area.

            require purchasing through other means.
5. ASSET ACCOUNTABILITY
   5.1. Defining Equipment Items and Accountability.
      5.1.1. Equipment assets are defined IAW AFI 23-101, Chap. 5, Sec. 5D, Para. 5.4.3.1.1.
      Items are considered accountable Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID).
      These items require formal supply property accountability and must be reflected on the
      organization's Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL).
   5.2. Equipment.
      5.2.1. Review. Commanders and directors appoint equipment custodians IAW AFI 23-
      101 Chap. 5, Sec. 5D, Para. 5.4.2.6.1, to the commanding squadron shop/ ORG account
      requesting the equipment property. Equipment custodians will perform equipment and
      authorization review with communication between LGL and 88 LGR equipment section.
      5.2.2. Equipment Records. The total of all assets on custody account balances will be
      reflected on the Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL)-also called the R14.
      5.2.3. Equipment Custodian and Accounts. Establish equipment custody accounts for
      each custodian. Appoint a primary and alternate equipment custodian for each account.
      Accountable equipment is issued only to properly appointed/trained equipment
      custodians or alternates IAW AFI 23-101 Chap. 5, Sec. 5D, Para. 5.5.7.4.1.5.
            5.2.3.1. Appointment of Custodians. The organization commander/director will
            submit to 88MSG/LGRSSE, a formal letter IAW AFMAN 23-110 Vol. 2, Part 2,
            Chap. 22, Wright Patterson AFB SUP attachment A22C_2, to appoint and/or change
            equipment custodians or alternates. IAW AFI 23-101 Chap. 5, Sec. 5D, Para.
            5.4.3.1.4, if an appointment or change of custodian is due to PCS, separation, or
            retirement, commanders must ensure a new appointment letter is forwarded to the
            88MSG/LGRSSE no later than 45 days prior to departure date.
            5.2.3.2. Unsigned Equipment Accounts. If a commander allows a primary
            equipment custodian to depart a duty station or unit without designating a new
            replacement to receipt for the equipment account within 45 calendar days prior to
            departure, the commander will immediately sign CA/CRL and accept responsibility.
            This procedure also applies when both the primary and alternate custodians are absent
            for more than 45 calendar days and no new custodians have been appointed.

    5.2.4. Equipment Custodian Account and Responsibilities. The Equipment custodian is
    accountable for their account IAW AFMAN 23-122, Chap. 5, Sec. 5D and AFI 23-101,
    Chap. 5, Sec. 5D and AFM 23-220, Reports of Survey.
       5.2.4.1. IAW AFMAN 23-122 Chap. 5, Sec. 5D, para 5.4.15.3.3, new custodians will
       perform a joint inventory of the CA/CRL with the outgoing custodian. If
       discrepancies are discovered, the new custodian will not assume custodial
       responsibility until a Report of Survey (ROS) is initiated and the accounted records
       are adjusted. When the new custodian is fully satisfied that items and quantities
       included on the CA/CRL are accurate, he or she must sign on the last page
       acknowledging responsibility for the property.
       5.2.4.2. Equipment Inventory. Request CA/CRL from the 88MSG/LGRSSE to
       ensure the information is complete and accurate. Perform inventories at least
       annually (unless otherwise specified in AFMAN 23-122, Chap. 10, Sec. 10B) in a
       “floor to book style.” This involves a physical count of all assets within a given work
       area and reconciling them with a property book record. In other words, ensure all
       assets can be traced back to a CA/CRL or other record if the property requires
       accountability, (i.e. most items over $2500 should be entered on a formal property
       record, usually a CA/CRL. Ensure that all items are on-hand and serviceable. Ensure
       all assets have a Unique Item Identifier (UII) that is associated with equipment data
       within AFEMS. Assist supply personnel when inventories are performed by LRS.
       NOTE: Normally, inventories are performed by the respective custodians. Inventory
       of EAID accounts is performed by LRS personnel only when the organization
       commander or staff agency director requests it in writing, and the request is approved
       by the LRS/CC. All such requests must be completely justified, noting specific
       discrepancies that cannot be resolved by requesting organization.
          5.2.4.2.1. Complete inventories within 15 workdays from the date listed on the
          CA/CRL. Take action to locate any missing items and inform supervisor and/or
          organization commander/responsible officer of assets requiring report of survey
          action.
          5.2.4.2.2. After the inventory is complete and discrepancies are resolved, (to
          include ROS), both the custodian and organization commander will sign the new
          CA/CRL. The custodian's signature indicates his/her responsibility and
          accountability for all property in his/her possession and the commander's
          signature indicates responsibility for assets under his/her control and certifies the
          inventory took place and discrepancies have been resolved. Forward signed
          CA/CRLs to 88MSG/LGRSSE to be filed until the next required inventory
          transpires.
       5.2.4.3. COMSEC Inventory. Accomplish COMSEC inventory semi-annually,
       February and August, IAW AFI 23-101, Chp. 10, Sec. 10B and AFMAN 23-122,
       Chap. 10, Sec 10B. Inventories will be conducted in a floor to notebook style
       ensuring all COMSEC in the scope of the custodian is annotated.
          5.2.4.3.1. IAW AFI23-101, Chap. 10, Sec. 10B, Para 10.2.6, Air Force activities
          will perform complete 100% physical inventories for controlled materiel, to
          include equipment in-use asset. Sample inventories are not authorized.
NASICI23-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                   7


           5.2.4.3.2. Equipment Custodian will physically verify the serial number on the
           item matches the serial number on the record.
           5.2.4.3.3. Equipment Custodian will maintain inventory records for a minimum
           of 2 years in accordance with DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Materiel
           Management Regulation.
           5.2.4.3.4. The activity will conduct an investigation to determine if losses were
           result of theft or misappropriation prior to attributing the loss to an inventory or
           accountability discrepancy in accordance with DoD 7000.14R, Vol. 12, Chap. 7,
           Special Accounts, Funds, and Programs and AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey
           for Air Force Property.
     5.2.5. Equipment Custodian Account Records. Equipment custodians maintain files
     IAW AFMAN 23-122, Chap. 5, Sec. 5D, Para. 5.4.17.4. The custodian maintains this
     file on each account for which he or she is responsible. The file is made up of the
     following mandatory items and must be maintained in the suggested sequence listed
     below.

           5.2.5.7.5. Deployment Accountability Documents.
    5.2.6. Equipment Accountability. The custodian will maintain equipment accountability
    IAW AFMAN 23-110 Vol. 2 Part 13, Chap. 8. Transfers of equipment for rotation,
    exercise, deployments, or inter- or intra-command loans. Custodians immediately notify
    the 88MSG/LGRSSE before physical movement of the item. Notify the
    88MSG/LGRSSE when the item is returned, or when they receive the item from other
    activities.
       5.2.6.1. Prepare and maintain AF Form 1297 for items loaned outside the custodian's
       span of control. Items that are excess to requirements or should be transferred must
       not be loaned. Spot checks or periodic verification must be accomplished semi-
       annually to ensure property is being adequately controlled and maintained. General
       log forms or locally approved electronic logs may be used in lieu of the AF Form
       1297 for equipment items checked in and out on a daily basis. Examples are portable
       radios and small arms.
    5.2.7. Relief from Responsibility or Accountability. The custodian makes sure that all
    property charged to the account is on hand or that action has been taken to clear the
NASICI23-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                    9


     account of missing or damaged items. The 88MSG/LGRSSE advises organization
     commanders and custodians in completing the needed adjustment documents and makes
     equipment identity changes needed to correct errors. NOTE: Policies and procedures
     regarding the unauthorized use of property, recovery of property unlawfully held, and
     accounting for property lost or destroyed by other than fair wear and tear are in AFMAN
     23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force property.
  5.3. Accountability of Pilferable property.
     5.3.1. Pilferable items are items which are not required to be accounted through the base
     supply system or through AFI 33-101, Commanders Guidance and Responsibilities, but
     are readily transportable and which are deemed easily resold on the open market. Asset
     tracking and custodial responsibilities for these items is the responsibility of the
     organizational commander or designated representative. Logistics Readiness Squadron/
     supply activity personnel have no responsibility to manage, inventory or monitor these
     items. At least annually commanders/directorates must take action to ensure items
     purchased using GPC and requiring accountability, are accounted for on the
     Organizational Visibility Listing (Attachment 2) that provides visibility and audit trail
     capability. This is accomplished by using receipt of NASIC FORM 11 signed by
     customer and excel spreadsheet(s). Each Squadron commander / directorate will appoint
     at a minimum two personnel, primary, and alternate, unless an already appointed
     equipment account custodian(s) has been appointed, then the appointed equipment
     custodian(s) will maintain accountability of pilferable assets.
     5.3.2. Pilferable items vary in dollar value, but are of sufficient dollar value to pose a
     temptation to theft, and to warrant administrative efforts to account for and control them.
     A sample list of pilferable items is as follows: digital cameras, appliances, audio
     equipment, broadcasting and support supplies, UPS battery backups, electronic labeling
     systems, hand tools, and shop equipment.
     5.3.3. In addition, the unit commander may deem any items purchased as a pilferable
     item subject to this center instruction. The NASIC FORM 11 will be marked as R15 by
     LGLS if considered pilferable.
     5.3.4. Any person who is accountable for a pilferable item must take the appropriate
     measures to safeguard it. When the item is no longer required or becomes unserviceable
     it must be turned-in to the custodian to record the items disposition (e.g. redistribution to
     another member. Turn in as excess. Etc.).
         5.3.4.1. The group/directorate NASIC FORM 11 Custodian & Resource Advisor
         (RA) have responsibility for oversight of this policy. The 88th LGR will audit the
         Squadron(s) / Directorate(s) Organizational Visibility List at the time of the
         approving official and cardholder random audits.
  5.4. Personal Property.
     5.4.1. Personal property used in government offices will have identification permanently
     attached to identify the owner. The identification should be marked, at a minimum, as
     follows:
     5.4.2. The Property of (Your Full Name & Telephone number)
