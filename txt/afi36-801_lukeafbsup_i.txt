      WEARING OF UNIFORMS AND ESTABLISHING UNIFORM ALLOWANCES

1.1. When US Citizen Employees Wear Uniforms:
     1.1.1. US citizen employees of the Air Force must wear uniforms when:
        1.1.1.1. Hired directly as a guard or police officer. Employees who are classified under
        standards who have primary functions in the fields of investigation and identification are
        excluded from wearing a uniform. Employees having both guard and firefighter duties
        wear the uniform for their primary assignment.
        1.1.1.2. Employed in the Fire Protection and Prevention series, GS-081.
        1.1.1.3. Employed as a chauffeur of vehicles assigned to the Secretary, Under Secretary,
        and Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force; Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff, United
        States Air Force; or additional key officials of the Air Force as periodically designated by
        HQ USAF.
        1.1.1.4. Employed as a chauffeur or an operator of passenger vehicles. Commanders of
        major commands (MAJCOM) prescribe the uniform that the driver must wear.
        1.1.1.5. Employed as a physical education instructor at the USAF Academy Athletic
        Department.
        1.1.1.6. Assigned to 47th FTW Aircraft Maintenance, where their work makes ready-
        identification important.
        1.1.1.7. Hired to operate and maintain the water craft fleet assigned to the 3613th CCTS,
        USAF Water Survival School.
        1.1.1.8. Employed as an audio-visual equipment operator by Air University.
        1.1.1.9. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Air Reserve Technicians (ART) must
        wear the military uniform while performing civilian duties as an ART.
     1.1.2. US citizen employees of the Air Force in oversea areas (or employees being deployed
     to oversea areas) may be required to wear uniforms if the theater or air component
     commanders determine there is an actual or threatened outbreak of hostilities, involving war,
     major civil disturbance (or other equally grave situations), or where the deployment
     necessitates the wearing of uniforms in specifically defined geographic areas.
     1.1.3. Direct hire employees of the Air Force who aren’t US citizens must wear uniforms
     when the oversea commander determines that the mission necessitates uniforms.
     1.1.4. Employees are not required to wear uniforms when they are appointed for 3 months or
     less or for any period of appointment, unless their work makes ready-identification important
     and wearing uniforms will accomplish that objective.

        1.2.6.5. Formulate and publish policy guidance on Air Force civilian uniform materials.
1.3. Furnishing Uniforms:
     1.3.1. The Air Force must either furnish a uniform or provide a uniform allowance to all
     civilian employees required to wear uniforms. When giving an employee a rented or
     purchased uniform, be sure that the cost doesn’t exceed the actual cost of the uniform or the
     maximum uniform allowance, whichever is less.
        1.3.1.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) The Fire Chief will determine the necessary uniform,
        replacement need and allowance rates when employees are selected for Fire Department
        positions not covered by the attachments in AFI 36-801.
     1.3.2. Civilian employees normally must clean or launder their uniforms at their own
     expense.
     1.3.3. Procure uniforms locally in accordance with established AF supply procedures.
     1.3.4. When renting uniforms, account for and process the rental in the same way as other
     contractual services.
1.4. Establishing Uniform Allowances. A uniform allowance helps the employee pay for the
uniform. It must not exceed the maximum authorized under 10 U.S.C. 1593. The Air Force
does not categorize uniform allowances paid under this instruction as pay, salary, or
compensation.
     1.4.1. To establish an allowance, consider the quality of each uniform item that the
     employee needs to maintain a satisfactory standard of appearance. Base the initial allowance
     on the costs of the items that make up the required uniform, but be sure you don’t exceed the
     maximum allowance limitation.
        1.4.1.1. The initial allowance is effective as of the date an employee must first wear a
        uniform and covers a 1-year period from that date. Don’t give the initial allowance to
        any employee or former employee who leaves a position before getting an authorized
        uniform allowance.
AFI36-801_LUKEAFBSUP_I 6 OCTOBER 2011                                                           9


   1.4.2. A replacement allowance reimburses employees for those uniform items that need
   replacement because of damage or wear. Local activities establish wearout periods for
   replacing uniforms, but the minimum period is 1 year.
EXCEPTION:
Damage to clothing items beyond acceptable appearance standards qualifies for a replacement
allowance.
       1.4.2.1. When establishing wearout periods, consider such factors as these: environment
       (heat and cold); the likelihood that some items wear out sooner (for example, coat, hat,
       trousers); seasons (winter, summer); flame retardancy, and so on.
       1.4.2.2. Set the replacement allowance to take into account locality, environment,
       amount of expense and frequency of replacement.
       1.4.2.3. Provide the replacement allowance on an annual or quarterly basis. Be sure to
       pay it in full before the wearout period.
       1.4.2.4. (Added-LUKEAFB) Fire Department employees requesting replacement
       allowance for portion(s) of the uniform due to damage caused beyond the control of the
       employee, which affects appearance standards, or normal wear out (cannot be less than
       one year from initial uniform allowance), will submit their request in writing, to the Fire
       Chief. The Fire Chief will determine the replacement need and rate. If replacement is
       warranted, approved request will be submitted to the Civilian Payroll Office.
   1.4.3. Authorize an annual allowance only for an employee who has the same uniform
   requirements throughout the year. If an activity has provided an annual allowance and the
   employee leaves a job requiring the wearing of the same uniform, the employee may keep
   one-fourth of the payment for each quarter or portion of a quarter the employee held the job.
   The employee must return the balance of the annual payment.
       1.4.3.1. When employees are on extended leave, with or without pay, at the time a
       replacement allowance is due (quarterly or annual), and the supervisor has good reason to
       expect that the employee will not return to work for at least 30 calendar days into the
       period, withhold the replacement allowance.
       1.4.3.2. Employees who resume their position before the end of the quarter are entitled to
       the replacement allowance for the quarter.
       1.4.3.3. Employees who receive a replacement allowance on an annual basis don’t
       receive payments until they return to work. Their new annual payment cycle begins on
       that date.
       1.4.3.4. Employees given quarterly replacement allowances, who leave before the period
       of service involved expires, don’t have to pay back the uniform allowance.
   1.4.4. Commanders determine the amounts of uniform allowances for eligible temporary
   employees. The commander’s principle criteria are the employee’s job requirements and the
   nature of the temporary employment. Allowances for temporary employees to should be
   kept to a minimum.
 10                                        AFI36-801_LUKEAFBSUP_I 6 OCTOBER 2011


      1.4.4.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) The Fire Chief will determine, at the time of selection, the
      pro-rata uniform allowance rate for temporary Fire Department employees whose
      appointments are for three months or less.
1.5. Uniform Allowances for Reemployed or Transferred Employees:
   1.5.1. Transferred or rehired employees don’t receive a new allowance for identical uniform
   requirements if it overlaps a period for which the employee was paid an initial or
   replacement allowance.
   1.5.2. Employees transferred to or rehired in a position different from the one they left may
   receive an initial uniform allowance.
      1.5.2.1. Employees who leave a position and are later rehired in or transferred to a
      position with identical or similar uniform requirements may receive an initial uniform
      allowance if at least 1 full year has passed since the end of the period covered by the last
      allowance payment.

uniforms. They issue policy letters notifying installations of any changes to this instruction. The
policy letter includes the implementation dates for the new uniform, a detailed description of the
uniform’s material and accessories, and other pertinent facts needed by the supervisor and
employee to implement the policy. The policy letter is an extension of this instruction and
carries the same authority.
   2.4.1. When the Air Force revises civilian uniform items or specifications, employees
   subject to the new requirements may continue to wear their current uniform if it doesn’t pose
   a safety risk or hazard to the employee.
   2.4.2. Supervisors must ensure that when employees purchase replacement items, the items
   meet the new requirements.
2.5. Standards of Appearance. Employees required to wear uniforms must:
