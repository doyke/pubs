This instruction standardizes procedures for managing an effective Functional Check Flight
(FCF) and Operational Check Flight (OCF) programs. The 436 MXG/CC and 436 OG/CC have
joint responsibility for the effective management of these programs. The success of these
programs begins with the cooperation between the Operations and Maintenance communities.
Quality Assurance and the Operations Group Standardization Evaluation (OGV) will work
together in the development of these programs. In the event of an FCF/OCF requirement, the
FCF/OCF Procedural Checklist (Attachment 2) will be utilized for coordination of all agencies
involved.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been updated with additional guidance in Attachment 2 (FCF/OCF
Procedural Checklist) and several points of contact changes. Also, paragraph 3.2 has some
added verbiage to cover Ram Air Turbine (RAT) procedures for both C-5 and C-17.
1. FUNCTIONAL CHECK FLIGHTS (FCF):
     1.1. FCFs are determined by the requirements outlined in T.O. 1-1-300,
     Acceptance/Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks, T.O. 1C-5A-
     6/1C-5M-6, Aircraft Scheduled Inspection and Maintenance Requirements and T.O. 1C-17A-
     6, Inspection Requirements Manual or as directed by the Maintenance Group (MXG)
     Commander.
     1.2. The OG/CC (or equivalent) appoints a qualified, thoroughly experienced individual to
     serve as FCF/OCF OIC. This OIC serves as the focal point for FCF/OCF matters and is the
     liaison QA works with to schedule FCFs and OCFs.
     1.3. DAFB crews are not currently qualified nor authorized to perform FCFs. AFI 11-2C-
     5V3, C-5 Operations Procedures and AFI 11-2C-17V3, C-17 Operations Procedures, Chapter
     5 outlines the procedures to follow in the event an FCF is required.
        1.3.1. The 436 OG/OGV will work with the local Dover Boeing Site Manager to
        schedule a C-17 FCF.
     1.4. C-5A/B/M FCF scheduling will be coordinated by the aircraft maintenance unit
     responsible for the affected aircraft and Plans and Scheduling office to schedule an FCF
     qualified aircrew to perform the flight.
     1.5. Quality Assurance (QA) and the Production Flight Superintendent are the focal points
     concerning the maintenance conditions requiring the FCF. QA will ensure the Aircraft 781-
     series forms and the Aircraft Primary Weight and Balance (W&B) forms are available for
     review and discussion.
     1.6. QA will maintain the automated Functional Check Flight Log to provide FCF historical
     information and analysis.
     1.7. Only FCF crews are authorized to perform high-speed taxi checks.
2. Operational Check Flights (OCF):
     2.1. OCFs are determined by the requirements outlined in the 1C-5A-6/1C-5M-6, 1C-5A-
     1/1C-5M-1, and 1C-5A-2-1/1C-5M-2-1 thru 1C-5A-2-15/1C-5M-2-15 series tech data, or
     when test equipment does not exist to perform the check on the ground. OCFs must be flown
     by experienced aircrews (not required to be an FCF qualified aircrew), must be briefed by
     QA for aircraft condition, and accomplished following the same maintenance criteria as
     FCFs. Under normal circumstances, the MXG point of contact will provide 24 hours prior
     notice to 436 OSS/OSO to ensure aircrew availability.
        2.1.1. For C-17 Aircraft, no specific operational check flight guidance exists.
     2.2. Coordination between the following agencies is vital to this program:
DOVERAFBI21-202 28 APRIL 2014                                                                 3


      2.2.1. Quality Assurance (QA): QA will be the point of contact between maintenance
      and operations. QA personnel will schedule OCF briefings to communicate the flight
      profile and operational checks required for completion.
      2.2.2. Operations Group Standardization/Evaluation (OGV): OGV will coordinate with
      the flying squadrons to provide the most qualified pilots, engineers, and all other
      necessary crew members to accomplish the required checks. As a minimum, the crew
      should include a highly experienced instructor or evaluator pilot, an instructor engineer,
      and a first engineer.
      2.2.3. Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS): AMXS will evaluate all aircraft and
      recommend whether or not an OCF is required before returning the aircraft to regular
      service after CANN status. AMXS will provide information on all maintenance/repair
      actions and provide specialist representatives to discuss any affected systems.
      2.2.4. Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D): PS&D will coordinate and
      schedule all required OCFs. OCF missions will be conducted outside the training fence.
      If an in-flight ram RAT check is required, P&S will coordinate with maintenance and
      operations to schedule aircraft for a local and annotate “RAT check due” in the remarks
      block of the flying schedule.
      2.2.5. Maintenance Squadron (MXS): MXS will provide information on all maintenance
      and repair actions and provide specialist representatives to discuss systems affected by
      their maintenance actions.
      2.2.6. The MXG/CC or designee will be the final approval authority for the OCF. QA
      and applicable AMU supervision will provide all the information required and/or
      requested to the MXG/CC or designee to support the request for an OCF.
3. In-Flight Operational Check of the RAM Air Turbine (RAT):
   3.1. If an in-flight operational check of the RAT is due, Raptor 2/Talon 2 will coordinate
   with Plans and Scheduling to locally restrict the aircraft so the check can be accomplished.
   3.2. Any crew is capable of performing an in-flight RAT operational check (OCF/FCF crew
   is not required). C-5 and C-17 crews will utilize their respective -6CF-1 checklist (provided
   by maintenance) to complete the RAT check. For C-5s, the procedure is the Traffic Pattern
   RAT check and for the C-17 the procedure is RAT deployment located in the Approach
   Section. After completion of the local checklist, if the system checks good, the flight crew
   will sign off the discrepancy in the aircraft forms and inform maintenance of any findings.

     FCF flight debrief IAW 1-1-300.
A2.6. Sequence of Events:
     A2.6.1. Aircraft has met the requirements of 1C-5A-6/1C-5M-6, Chapter 1, Section III, 1C-
     17A-6, Chapter 2, Part B, or TCTO FCF/OCF requirement or determined to fly OCF as per
     MXG/CC.
     A2.6.2. AMXS/MXS notifies QA.
     A2.6.3. QA notifies PS&D.
     A2.6.4. PS&D notifies AMC/A4MYA if an FCF crew is required from the 339th Test Flight
     Squadron. If an OCF is required, notify DOV Current OPS.
     A2.6.5. QA will notify Stan/Eval (OGV) for requirement with anticipated take-off time if
     applicable.
     A2.6.6. QA will schedule the briefing the day prior to the anticipated take-off with OGV,
     AMXS/ MXS, PS&D, the pilot, the flight engineer, and Flight Safety from the Wing Safety
     Office. This briefing will normally be held in the MXG complex. AFETS may be asked to
     attend this briefing when necessary. QA will keep attendance sign-in sheet for the FCF/OCF
     log. This briefing will be conducted with the availability of FCF/OCF crew from the 339th
     when arriving on station. The 339th Test Flight, Warner-Robins AFB, is the squadron
     designated to perform C-5 FCF/OCF flights.
     A2.6.7. The briefing will be chaired by QA. All historical data relating to the event which
     requires the FCF/OCF should be available at this briefing; e.g. engine histories (8050 and
     AFTO 95) and G081 with actual 781A forms if necessary. This briefing will provide all
     parties involved with the requirements of the FCF/OCF.
     A2.6.8. The status of the aircraft will be strictly tracked by AMXS/MXS. QA and the MOC
     will be informed if the status changes. The MOC will inform Current OPS of any status
     changes that will effect scheduled take-off time. If the status changes and the scheduled
DOVERAFBI21-202 28 APRIL 2014                                                                7


  take-off will be delayed, the FCF/OCF flight will be re-cut 24-hours later based on
  maintenance ETIC’s.
  A2.6.9. Once the flight is complete, QA will attend the flight debrief. If the FCF/OCF was
  satisfactory, QA will forward the flight procedure checklist to PS&D for insertion into the
  aircraft file jacket. If the FCF/OCF was not satisfactory, it will be logged on the automated
  QA log, with reason for failure. At debrief, QA will discuss the availability of the aircrew
  for the next FCF/OCF flight. It is highly recommended the same crew fly the next flight for
  continuity. If the crew is not available, PS&D will be notified to re-accomplish checklist
  step number 4 and continue. A copy of Flight Authorization Form 41 will be filed by QA.
