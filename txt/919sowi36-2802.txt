SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The Safety Sign at the front gate and award winners receiving a reserved parking spot have both
been removed, ; paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3. A margin bar indicates newly revised material.
1. Objective: Recognition of quality performers by commanders and supervisors at all levels is
critically important. Recognition provides rewards to those individuals who are top performers
and highlights role models for other personnel to emulate. This safety awards program promotes
a vigorous mishap prevention program through recognition for individuals and work centers
assigned to the 919 SOW. Commanders (CCs) should publicize this program and encourage
supervisors to review achievements often to ensure deserving individuals and work centers are
nominated. Commanders are also encouraged to develop and implement complementing
incentives to further unit goals and enhance the 919 SOW.
