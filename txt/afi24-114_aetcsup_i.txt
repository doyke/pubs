                                GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

1.1. Security. Everyone involved in the movement of passengers and cargo on DoD-owned and
controlled aircraft has the responsibility to prevent the possible hijacking or sabotage of an
aircraft. Passenger processing and cargo handling personnel must be alert to detect any unusual
conduct of persons entering the terminal area or any suspicious items offered for air shipment.
Terminal personnel, security officials and aircrew members share the responsibility for security
of the air terminal and aircraft while they are on the ground. For more guidance, refer to AFI 10-
701, Operations Security (OPSEC); AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management;
AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management; and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT).
1.2. Safety. To prevent mishaps, hazards, and avoid accidents, managers and supervisors at all
levels must make safety a top priority. Terminal personnel also have the responsibility to follow
established policies and procedures. Small terminal manager responsibilities in this area include
but are not limited to:
   1.2.1. Provide safe and healthful workplaces.
   1.2.2. Ensure all individuals receive necessary on/off duty safety training.
   1.2.3. Ensure a proactive mishap prevention program is implemented in the unit to include
   the procurement and proper use of the appropriate personal protective equipment and facility
   compliance with applicable Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) and Air
   Force Occupational Safety Health standards IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
   Prevention Program.
   1.2.4. Ensure equipment operators and spotters use standard aircraft loading hand signals
   and follow procedures for operating vehicles on and off the flightline, including pre-
   positioning wheel chocks IAW AFMAN 24-306 IP, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle
   Operator.
   1.2.5. Refer to AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo, for procedures
   on cargo contaminated by Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear High Yield
   Explosives (CBRNE).
1.3. Air Transportation Training Requirements. The purpose of training is to ensure each
individual is prepared to meet Air Force mission requirements. Commanders should make every
effort to ensure assigned military/civilian small terminal operations personnel are thoroughly
trained on all core tasks through a local proficiency training plan and/or off-site training. A
website hosted by the Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributive Learning (AFIADL)
currently hosts additional air transportation web-based training courses at
https://www.usafec.af.mil/students/cc/index.asp. Respective MAJCOM may direct enrollment
and require specific course completion for military/civilian 2T2X1 assigned personnel in order to
enhance force development and career field proficiency. Additionally, unit funded formal
training quotas offered through the USAF Expeditionary Center at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-
Lakehurst (JBMDL), NJ may be obtained from respective MAJCOM POC. All Unit Training
Monitors (UTM) must be approved and appointed in writing by their respective commander.
Units will provide a current training letter (January) to their respective MAJCOM Training

is required to support training needs of the 2T0XX, 2T2XX, and 2T1XX career fields.
     1.3.1. Joint Inspection Training Requirements. Joint Inspection (JI) is defined as the
     inspection of aircraft loads by qualified representatives from the deploying unit and the
     supporting airlift representative. Small air terminal managers will ensure designated
     personnel meet JI qualification requirements listed in AMCI 24-101, Volume 22, Training
     Requirements for Aerial Port Operations, Attachment 3 for Guard and Reserve units, or
     Attachment 4 for Active Duty units.
     1.3.1. (AETC) In coordination with the Installation IDO, AETC Small Air Terminal
     managers will review current OPLANS to determine their installations applicability as a
     deployment cargo APOE. If not designated as an APOE, small air terminals will not be
     required to have or maintain a Unit JI Program Manager or JI Instructor. Units will be
     required to have personnel who are JI qualified.
     1.3.2. Load Planning Training Requirements. Designated personnel must complete the
     requirements for load planning qualification IAW AMCI 24-101, Volume 22, Attachment 5.

     AFMAN 24-204 IP, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, Attachment
     25, for additional guidance. Handlers Familiarization training is typically the minimal level
     required for day-to-day air transportation HAZMAT operation.
     1.3.3. (AETC) Hazardous Material Preparer (Initial) and (Refresher) course (s)
     LCAZP2T051 00AA and L6ARW2T051 00AA will also satisfy requirements for JI
     certification.
     1.3.4. Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Training. NWRM training requirements
     are located in AFI 20-110, Para 9.1 and are outlined in the NWRM QTP. All personnel

will provide information on quarterly deployment training status to the Installation Deployment
Officer (IDO). The IDO will consolidate information and brief installation/wing commander
IAW AFI 10-403.
     1.4.1. Deployment Operations Training. Small air terminal operations assigned personnel
     will provide training of wing personnel to fulfill deployment tasks. The specific
     responsibilities of this work center include but are not limited to:
        1.4.1.1. Develops, conducts, and documents the wing’s transportation deployment
        training.
        1.4.1.2. Maintains air transportation related work center deployment lesson plans. Units
        are encouraged to seek assistance from the host wing IDO to develop training plans IAW
        AFI 10-403, Attachment 5. Lesson plans must be written to the point they provide
        enough detail for the instructor to convey to the student their role in the deployment
        operation and should be aligned with the wing’s/base’s deployment commitment.
        Respective MAJCOMs may publish lesson plan templates for local use.
        1.4.1.3. All deployment lesson plans will include Installation Deployment Plan (IDP)
        overview.
     1.4.2. As a minimum, develop deployment lesson plans for the following areas: Load
     Planning Overview, Cargo Preparation/Pallet Build Up, Ramp Coordinator, Cargo
     Deployment Function work-centers (i.e., In-Check, Cargo Marshalling Yard, Joint
     Inspection, Hazardous Cargo Handlers, Explosives Safety, Quality Control, and Load Teams)
     and the transportation portion of the Passenger Deployment Function. Small air terminal
     managers will coordinate with deploying units requiring hazardous material technical
     specialist training; however, local Deployment and Distribution (D&D) Flight will actually
     conduct hazardous material technical specialist training as outlined in AFMAN 24-204 IP.
     Deploying units should contact the local D&D Flight for any HAZMAT technical specialist
     training required.
        1.4.2.1. Ensures training modules are as comprehensive as possible to give individuals a
        clear understanding of their duties and the importance of the deployment operation.
        Refer to AFI 10-403, Attachment 5 for specific training requirements.

        part of each course curriculum.
        1.4.2.3. To enhance course material comprehension, instructors should use visual aids,
        allow students as much time as possible for practical training and classroom discussion,
        have students fill out forms and demonstrate defined task procedures. Use tests, quizzes,
        and handouts as appropriate to help explain and/or clarify course materials is
        recommended.
        1.4.2.4. Local management may allow the use of properly trained 2T2 personnel to assist
        2T0 personnel with teaching hazardous material Technical Specialist training. Overall
        responsibility and program management will reside with D&D Flight. Respective
        MAJCOM Functional Managers can approve a limited number of 2T2 personnel for the
        Hazardous Materials Preparer Certifications Course upon justification from unit.

      1.4.2.4. (AETC) Units will send requests to HQ AETC/A4RXT
      1.4.2.5. Units with a mobility commitment should use the JA/ATT program as an
      augmentee training opportunity.       When “real world” augmentee team loading
      opportunities are not available to units, the JA/ATT program is a viable tool. Units
      should submit JA/ATT requests to respective MAJCOM (see Attachment 4, JA/ATT
      Request).
1.5. 463L Pallet and Net Management.
   1.5.1. 463L Pallets/Nets. The redistribution of serviceable equipment will be directed and
   controlled by each command’s pallet and net manager.
      1.5.1.1. All Pallet and Net Managers must be appointed in writing by the MSG/CC or
      equivalent. Units will provide a current training letter (January) to their respective
      MAJCOM annually or earlier as needed for change of personnel. Once pallet and net
      managers are appointed, a Global Asset Reporting Tool (GART) account will be
      established (see Attachment 5, Program Manager Letter).
      1.5.1.1. (AETC) Pallet and Net Managers appointment letters will be updated and
      provided to HQ AETC/A4RXT NLT 31 January of each calendar year or earlier as
      needed for change of personnel.
   1.5.2. Control, maintain, inspect, and report pallets and nets IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part VI,
   Management and Control of Intermodal Containers and System 463L Equipment, its
   supplements, applicable Air Force Instructions, and any supplements, TO 35D 33-2-2-2,

   7/E, I, Side, HCU-15/C, II, Top, HCU11/C, III, Side, HCU-16/C, IV, Top. Conduct a
   physical inventory of pallets and nets, as required by the AF, Respective MAJCOM, or DoD
   Component pallet and net manager.
   1.5.2. (AETC) Units will conduct a physical inventory of pallets, nets, and RFID tags and
   report monthly in GART. Reports will be submitted between the 15th and 20th of each
   month.
   1.5.3. Re-validate 463L pallets and nets annually for operational and War Reserve Material
   (WRM) authorization levels. AMC will publish guidance annually to MAJCOMs on re-
   validation procedures.
   1.5.4. In the event a MAJCOM cannot support adequate 463L pallets and nets for a unit
   deployment, MAJCOM Pallet and Net Managers will coordinate with DoD Operational
   Manager (AMC) to request additional assets. Note: Only 463L pallets and nets will be
   provided by AMC. Couplers will only be provided, if necessary, for subfloor requirements.
      1.5.4.1. IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part VI, Ch 608, secure cargo to the aircraft floor using
      tiedown equipment organic to the aircraft or provided by the local air terminal. However,
      to secure cargo to pallets, units must procure and control their own pallet couplers, plastic
      coverings, tiedown equipment (less nets), and dunnage and/or shoring. It is not the
      responsibility of the local air terminal to provide this tiedown equipment to deploying
      units. For cargo moving via channel missions, tiedown equipment is subject to one-for-
      one exchange for serviceable items only.
 10                                                   AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013


       1.5.4.2. Units and shippers will program and fund the acquisition of tiedown equipment
       to move their shipments on 463L pallets to preclude work stoppages, cancellation, or
       delay of missions. DTR 4500.9-R, Part VI, Table 608-1 itemizes this equipment by
       nomenclature and national stock number.
   1.5.5. Units may be tasked by either their respective MAJCOM (or through proper
   coordination with AMC/A4TR) to ship 463L assets by official tasking. The official tasking
   must include tasking number, shipping address DODAAC, POC at receiving station, amount
   of 463L assets to be shipped, and appropriate transportation funding code. Units must
   respond to official tasking within 24 hours. The response must include the TCN, type
   movement and estimated ship date.
   1.5.6. Repair of damaged 463L pallets and nets is a critical part of overall mission success.
   All units are required to ship depot repairable pallets and nets to the appropriate repair
   facility.   Contact respective MAJCOM for shipping instructions and appropriate
   transportation funding.
       1.5.6.1. 463L nets in need of depot repair must be inspected and packaged according to
       T.O.35D33-2-3-1.
   1.5.7. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tag Management. RFID tags will be managed
   and reported using GART in conjunction with monthly 463L asset reporting. Small Terminal
   management will determine and maintain sufficient quantity of RFID tags and replacement
   batteries to support cargo operations. RFID tags should be ordered from DLA using normal
   supply replenishment procedures. Support IDO in managing unit move RFID requirements as
   described in AFI 24-203.
       1.5.7.1. Tags will not be left on net sets when pallet has been broken down.
       1.5.7.2. When tags are in storage, reverse the tag battery in its compartment to “turn off”
       the tag.
1.6. Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Operations. Unit commanders will ensure
personnel are fully trained to operate, inspect, and care for assigned assets. The unit will
establish a Vehicle Safety Program that includes accident prevention and reporting on all vehicle
accidents or incidents as outlined in AFMAN 24-306 IP.
   1.6.1. K-loader Safety. Note: Gravity loading of palletized cargo is prohibited.
       1.6.1.1. Aircraft load crew personnel may ride K-loader decks up to, or down from,
       aircraft cargo floor height providing the following safety provisions are followed: The
       K-loader parking brake is set and the transmission is in neutral. Personnel stay clear of
       the loader’s telescoping ladder and extreme ends of the deck. Ensure sufficient clearance
       between the K-loader and aircraft exists. At no time is load crew personnel allowed on
       the deck when the loader is moved forward or aft. However, in exceptional cases, when a
       spotter is required on the deck to aid in final K-loader/aircraft interface, the individual is
       required to wear a personal fall restraint equipment and harness.
       1.6.1.2. A fall restraint harness must be used when personnel are required to operate on a
       K-loader deck raised above 10 feet and are working past the last pallet lock on either end
       of the deck. Completion of restraint equipment and harness training will be documented
AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013                                                             11


     in the member's AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, AF Form 55,
     Employee Safety and Health Record, or online training software equivalent.
     1.6.1.3. All K-loaders: Cargo transported on K-loaders will be properly secured to the
     loader deck prior to initiating on/off loading operations or prior to placing the loader in
     motion. Engage integral braking systems for rolling stock, if equipped. When offloading
     rolling stock from K-loaders, at least one forward and one aft tie-down chain and device
     will restrain the rolling stock until secured to a prime mover. Operators are responsible
     for properly restraining palletized cargo on K-loaders prior to movement to include
     engaging the pallet stops. When necessary for the operator to remain in the cab of the K-
     loader, the loading supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance.
     1.6.1.4. Pallet rail locks: Engage all pallet rail guide locks for each pallet and engage
     both the emergency pallet stops. During on-loading operations, ensure each pallet is
     locked in place and pallet stops are engaged in the up position prior to pulling the forklift
     away from the K-loader. If pallets are loaded in a logistical configuration, apply
     supplemental restraint by using 10,000 lb chains or AMC-approved restraint to the
     forward and aft pallets when pallets are locked into only one rail guide lock. If no rail
     guide locks are engaged, supplemental restraint using 10,000 lb chains or AMC-approved
     restraint must be applied to each individual pallet. Straps will not be substituted for
     chains. Note: Supplemental restraint is not required for the Tunner and Halvorsen
     loaders when the pallet guide locks are engaged on both sides of all pallets.
     1.6.1.5. Pallet trains in lengths that exceed K-loader capacity, or pallet trains with
     overhang which prevents engaging both forward and aft emergency pallet stops, normally
     will not be transported on any type K-loader. If no alternate means are available and it is
     determined pallet handling limitations of a K-loader must be exceeded, small terminal
     management will work through ORM processes and provide specific guidance
     concerning placement of the pallet train on the loader. Additional precautionary
     measures should be considered to maximize safety, to include but not limited to,
     additional spotters and supplemental restraint.
     1.6.1.6. Do not drive loaded forklifts or other highly concentrated loads on K-loader
     deck surfaces. If no alternate means are available and it is determined a loaded forklift or
     other highly concentrated load must be driven on the K-loader deck, small terminal
     management will work through ORM process and provide specific operational guidance.
  1.6.2. Forklifts. Prior to movement, secure pallets to the forklift when:
     1.6.2.1. Loading/offloading/transporting pallets using rollerized tines
     1.6.2.2. Pallets are top/side heavy
     1.6.2.3. Snow or ice may have accumulated between the forklift tines and the pallet
  1.6.3. Secure all objects of irregular shape, including aircraft engines and aircraft propellers
  to the forklift carriage before being raised, lowered, or moved. Place large irregularly shaped
  objects on pallets for stability before transporting. Small terminal managers must also
  consult/review latest message traffic regarding unique cargo handling characteristics.
  Note: Ensure protruding engine parts (afterburners) and aircraft propellers are not damaged
  during transport.
 12                                                  AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013


       1.6.3.1. Secure skids/pallets or individual containers of explosives to forklifts to prevent
       movement. The cargo need not be secured to forklifts when container skids or pallets
       have integral tine enclosures. Positively secure/unitize stacked explosives prior to
       movement. Do not use forklifts to transport explosives in over-the-road type operations,
       or out of the immediate work area IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
   1.6.4. Wide Body Aircraft. Use loaders designed to service wide body aircraft when
   available. K-loader deck extenders and hi-lift trucks may be used as alternatives. Due to the
   fuselage contour of these aircraft, use extreme care when positioning equipment for
   on/offload operations. When K-loaders without deck extensions are used to service lower
   lobe compartments, they are normally backed to the aircraft. Before attempting to back a K-
   loader, the vehicle operator must ensure the primary spotter has pre-positioned the wheel
   chalks, is clearly in view and hand signals are understood. Accurate preliminary height
   adjustment of the loader deck is critical in lower lobe operations. The vehicle operator will
   stop the K-loader approximately 10 feet from the aircraft for preliminary height adjustment.
   Load crew personnel must exercise extreme caution when approaching and stepping over the
   gap between the loader deck and aircraft floor.
1.7. In-Transit Visibility. ITV data reporting provides movement visibility (location, status,
and availability) of DoD unit and non-unit personnel, cargo, and equipment. A primary source
of ITV data is Automated Information Systems (AIS) at transportation nodes. Small air terminal
managers will use Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) as the primary AIS for
documenting passenger travel, and the preparation, shipment, and receipt of cargo IAW DTR
4500.9-R, Part III, Mobility. Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES), where
authorized, may be used when CMOS is not available. Data fidelity and timeliness are critical
ITV factors. Small air terminal managers will release the manifest within 60 minutes after the
cargo/passengers have departed. Note: Small terminals that possess GATES for their day-to-day
operations may use GATES as the service system for manifesting duty and Space-A passengers.
1.8. Support Agreements. It is important to establish inter-service and host or tenant support
agreements, as appropriate, to clearly define the roles, mission and support at Air Force user-
operated small terminal locations. To facilitate deployments that include tenant unit and
transient forces, host installation commanders or equivalent will review responsibilities
identified in AFI 10-403. Deployment planning and execution roles and responsibilities must be
documented in the local Installation Deployment Plan (IDP). Small air terminal managers will
work closely with the Wing support agreement manager and refer to AFI 25-201, Support
Agreements Procedures, for further guidance on support agreement policy. Small air terminal
managers should also:
   1.8.1. Ensure all transportation issues are thoroughly analyzed in all agreements.
   1.8.2. Ensure all agreements are evaluated in terms of your unit's manpower and facilities
   capability.
1.9. Aerial Delivery Flight (ADF) Designated ADFs shall be postured to prepare, rig, and
inspect Air Force supplies and equipment for local assigned airdrop missions and unilateral
airdrop training IAW AMCI 24-101, Volume 18, Military Airlift – AMC Mobilized Aerial Port
Forces and Aerial Delivery Flights, Section H.

                                           Chapter 2

                                PASSENGER OPERATIONS

2.1. Purpose. It is imperative small air terminal management provide detailed local guidance
for the safe and efficient processing of passengers and their baggage. Eligible passengers for
travel are identified in DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility.
   2.1.1. Eligible passengers must process through the designated base passenger facility for
   manifesting and anti-hijack processing.         Small terminal operations retain overall
   responsibility for passenger manifesting/security, and maintains the Space Available sign-up
   roster. Deviations from this process must be approved by the respective MAJCOM.
   2.1.1. (AETC) Wing/Installation commanders are responsible to ensure the proper
   screening, processing, and manifesting of all passengers departing from AETC airfields and
   determining how to meet the requirements when base transportation work force is
   insufficient, especially during non-duty hours and weekends.
       2.1.1.1. (Added-AETC) In accordance with AFI 13-207, AETC exempts wing
       commanders, general officers, and senior executive service (SES) from passenger
       screening and baggage inspections. All other travelers, except exempted passengers, are
       required to process in person through the base passenger terminal facility. Should an
       exempted passenger desire to proceed directly to the aircraft, he/she must ensure that the
       person making his/her travel arrangements provide manifest information to the
       passenger-handling agency prior to aircraft departure (Attachment 2). Additionally, an
       exempted traveler may be allowed to vouch for his/her accompanying party to exempt
       them from processing through the terminal by including the names of the party on the
       passenger manifest. The exempted senior traveler shall be held accountable to ensure
       those persons in his/her party pose no hijacking threat and carry no prohibited items.
       Passengers exempted from anti-hijacking procedures are not exempted from being
       properly manifested. Group/team travelers (for example, spouse orientation flights,
       inspector general (IG) teams, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets) may be
       processed at an alternate location as long as manifesting and anti-hijacking requirements
       are accomplished. Any policy directing an alternate processing location should be
       coordinated through the passenger terminal and approved by the host wing commander.
       2.1.1.2. (Added-AETC) Small Air Terminal Operations at Columbus, Keesler,
       Laughlin, Sheppard, and Vance AFB’s are waived from the provisions of paragraph
       2.1.1. (as it pertains to maintaining a Space Available (Space-A) sign-up roster.
       Aforementioned installations must still comply with the remaining provisions of AFI 24-
       114 which requires monitoring ITV systems to identify Space-A opportunities and
       establishing a system to process Space-A passengers if presented. These processes will
       require designation of a base passenger facility for manifesting and anti-hijack processing
       (not necessarily a new facility, preexisting facilities such as those that house your
       Passenger Deployment function would be acceptable), designating a secure location
       (sterile area) in which screened passengers and screened baggage are isolated prior to
       aircraft loading, installation of Duress Alarm System linking the security forces facility
       and the passenger terminal inspection area check-in counters and the procurement of
AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013                                                              15


       hand-held wands to expedite passenger processing. Installations must also establish
       processes to inform base populace of Space-A opportunities, manifest passengers and
       ensure in-transit visibility.
   2.1.2. When practical, use of a public address system is recommended to make terminal
   announcements. The system type used is left to the discretion of local management.
   2.1.3. Maintain a system type or method for flight information display in the terminal where
   passengers may view flight information. The system or method for displaying information
   will be left to the discretion of local management. As a minimum, it should identify
   departing/arriving flights with the number of anticipated space-available seats, space-
   available call times, and manifest closeout times.
   2.1.4. Small Terminal Operations management must periodically review the following
   Transportation Security Administration website for the most current federal safety and
   security rules: http://www.tsa.gov/public/. These rules must be applied when developing
   terminal security and passenger anti-hijack procedures.
   2.1.5. Passengers will be required to present valid government issued identification.
   Passports, visas, and immunization records should be checked, if required according to the
   DoD Foreign Clearance Guide. Prior to boarding, match passenger ID cards against the final
   passenger manifest. Further guidance can be found by reviewing the DoD Foreign Clearance
   Guide at: https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil.
2.2. Sterile Area. Designate a secure location in which screened passengers, baggage, or cargo
are isolated prior to aircraft loading. Restrict personnel entrance to manifested passengers and
designated small air terminal operations personnel.
   2.2.1. Screen all passengers entering the sterile area. Keep passengers who have passed
   through the inspection point under surveillance in a sterile area until they board the aircraft.
   Ensure that individuals cannot bypass the security and screening process.
       2.2.1.1. Doors leading to the aircraft parking ramps/aprons must be locked when not in
       use.
       2.2.1.2. Install alarms on emergency exits.
       2.2.1.3. Protect passengers between the passenger processing point and the aircraft.
   2.2.2. Duress Alarm System. Install a duress alarm system at passenger processing points
   and check-in counters to summon local Security Forces for immediate assistance. The type
   of system used shall be jointly agreed upon by both local Air Terminal and Security Forces
   management. Considerations to this type of equipment should include, but not limited to base
   policies, terminal infrastructure, typical passenger movement types and velocity of
   passengers. The activating device (button/switch) must be out of public view to allow
   personnel monitoring/performing inspections to activate the alarm unnoticed. Duress alarms
   checks must be coordinated with the local Security Forces personnel and established in local
   directives or as stated in wing/base AFI 31-series publications.
   2.2.3. Advise all passengers that prohibited items will not be allowed beyond the screening
   checkpoints or into the cabin of the aircraft and must be disposed of or placed in their
   checked baggage prior to boarding the aircraft. Deny boarding of aircraft to passengers who

   refuse to comply with screening requirements. Conduct all inspections with the highest
   standards of military courtesy.
       2.2.3.1. Use of walk-through magnetometer or hand held wand is required to expedite
       passenger processing. All passengers and baggage accessible in flight will be inspected.
       Further inspect passengers who twice activate the walk-through metal detector (if
       installed) by using a hand held wand. If hand held wand is inoperable or unavailable a
       visual inspection is required.
       2.2.3.2. Small air terminal managers must establish local procedures for magnetometer
       testing and maintain documentation of its frequency. Guidelines and procedures listed in
       this paragraph are in accordance to AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
       (FOUO).
   2.2.4. If any item is noticed suspicious, such as a weapon, inconspicuously summon law
   enforcement agents. Security police will perform all required physical inspections (body
   searches) when circumstances warrant (Passenger Service agents can perform these searches
   when trained and certified by local SF).
   2.2.5. Refer to 4500.9-R, Part III, Appendix T, Duties and Responsibilities of Troop
   Commander (CDR) for his or her roles during unit movements. While the overall
   responsibility for baggage inspection rests with the troop commander, added DSOE
   events/timelines for the PDF, space requirements, and resources should be taken into
   consideration.
       2.2.5.1. Hand written or pre-stamped anti-hijacking statements should only be placed on
       manual passenger manifests IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol 14, Military Airlift Passenger
       Service, Para 35.7. CMOS and GATES manifests that include the auto-generated anti-
       hijacking statements will suffice for intended screening purposes.
2.3. DoD Aircraft Passenger Manifest Policy. Each installation will have a single space
available passenger register from which space available travel is accomplished as authorized by
DoD 4515.13-R. The maintenance of this passenger register will be the responsibility of Air
Mobility Command, where established. Where no AMC activity exists, the installation
commander will designate responsibility. A passenger manifest, to include Next of Kin
information, will be prepared for all DoD aircraft carrying passengers. If equipped, small
terminals may use GATES for their day-to-day passenger manifesting operation (space required,
space-A manifesting).
   2.3.1. Deploying passenger information is consolidated in Logistics Module (LOGMOD)
   and passed via file transfer to Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment
   (DCAPES) and subsequently to CMOS to provide ITV information.
   Note: CONUS AMC strategic aerial ports and OCONUS en routes as defined in the DTR
   4500.9-R may use GATES instead of CMOS to meet in-transit visibility requirements.
   2.3.2. IDS passenger manifests are not required for commercially ticketed passengers.
   2.3.3. Completion of the DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest (Attachment 2, DD Form
   2131, Passenger Manifest) is mandatory in the event of CMOS/automated system failure.
   Passenger processing personnel will use DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Passenger Movement.
AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013                                                                  17


Note: For non-deployment passengers, where CMOS is not available, the completed DD Form
2131 will be transmitted to AMC via e-mail to passenger.manifest@scott.af.mil, or if e-mail is
unavailable, faxed to DSN 576-3651, Commercial 618-256-3651. If using e-mail, include the
mission number, departure date/time, aircraft type, and aircraft tail number in the subject line.
2.4. Stand-by Passenger Procedures. Passengers space blocked or possessing travel
reservations have priority on airlift missions. Stand-by passengers will be assigned to a stand-by
category IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix E and DoD 4515.13-R, Chapters 2 and 6.
   2.4.1. Duty Stand-By Procedures. When passengers arrive at the passenger terminal to travel
   stand-by, pull a single copy of the travel order and record the priority and date/time of sign-
   up at the top of the order.
       2.4.1.1. Stand-by roll call will take place in sufficient time to meet aircraft departure
       times. Roll-call times are determined by local management based on size and scope of
       operation.
       2.4.1.2. For baggage restrictions, uniforms and dress procedure please refer to DoD
       4515.13-R.
   2.4.2. Space Available Stand-By. Only one space available register may be maintained per
   installation. Travelers must present border clearance documents such as passports, visas, and
   immunization records as required by the Foreign Clearance Guide at the time of travel. For
   specific guidance refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Chapter 103.
2.5. Passenger Check-In. Passenger service agents will verify all passengers have a copy of
their orders/travel authorization, and/or passport in their possession to fly aboard any DoD
aircraft. Travel orders will be checked for fiscal data, Customer Identification Code (CIC), and
signature block.
   2.5.1. Passenger Billing/Order Collection. Duty passengers are required to reimburse the
   DoD for travel aboard military aircraft. Passenger service agents must collect and process
   their documentation for billing. If there is any doubt, agents should collect order for further
   billing.
   2.5.2. Customer Identification Code (CIC). CICs are composed of 15 alphanumeric digits
   and indicate the service responsible for payment. Refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Chapter
   103, Section J.
2.6. Passenger Loading/Unloading. Passengers will be accompanied to/from the aircraft to
ensure flight-line safety and security is met. Small terminal representatives will meet all arriving
passenger aircraft and ensure the manifest is accurate. Any noted discrepancies will be corrected
on the spot. Passengers will be provided ear plugs prior to loading. Ensure the aircraft
representative has confirmed a correct passenger head count prior to aircraft departure.
   2.6.1. Develop procedures to evacuate passengers from the terminal or processing point in
   the event of a bomb threat.
   2.6.2. Ensure vehicles used to transport passengers remain under constant surveillance.
2.7. Baggage. Process baggage as follows:
   2.7.1. Contact security forces before removing unattended and unidentified baggage from
   the passenger processing point.
 18                                                AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013


   2.7.2. All baggage will be screened as thoroughly as available resources permit (X-ray,
   explosive detector dogs, walk through or handheld metal detectors or visual inspection).
   2.7.3. When inspection indicates cause for suspicion, a complete examination of the
   suspected baggage is mandatory.
   2.7.4. Oversee baggage from the time passengers check it in until baggage is loaded on the
   aircraft.
   2.7.5. Lost Baggage. Immediately telephone origin and en route stations to locate lost bags.
   2.7.6. Found Baggage. Local small terminal operations management must develop
   procedures to ensure baggage is returned to passengers expeditiously as possible. Contact
   your Traffic Management Flight for shipping instructions and assistance.
   2.7.7. Unclaimed Baggage. A small terminal operations representative and a security forces
   representative will jointly inventory the contents of the baggage. Items within the unclaimed
   baggage valued over $25.00 are held for 90 days and turned over the Installation Property
   Disposal Office (PDO). Any items under $25.00 are disposed of after 30 days through the
   Installation PDO. Weapons disposition will be turned over to the local Security Forces.
   2.7.8. Pilfered Baggage. The small air terminal operations representative will prepare a
   detailed inventory of the bag contents and description of the missing items with the passenger
   and representative from Security Forces. The inventory is prepared in four copies and
   distributed as follows: Original and one copy to the passenger, one copy to Security Forces
   and one copy for small terminal operations files. Advise the passenger to contact the
   servicing Staff Judge Advocate or the Air Force Claims Service Center at:
   https://claims.jag.af.mil/for information and assistance regarding claims for lost or stolen
   baggage.
   2.7.9. When 20 or more passengers/troops are planned for a movement, leave a pallet
   position open to accommodate palletized baggage. When planning any KC-10 mission that
   includes more than ten passengers, a dedicated baggage pallet is required. Floor loading of
   passenger baggage is not authorized.
   2.7.10. No-show passenger baggage. Download baggage of no-show passengers.
2.8. Unique Passengers. Special category passengers, pregnant and post partum mothers,
newborn infants and passengers with ammunition are processed IAW DoD 4515.13-R.
2.9. Travel Aboard Foreign Aircraft. US military personnel in a duty status may travel on
Royal Air Force, Canadian Armed Forces, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Royal New
Zealand Air Force (and any other country when a new agreement with the U.S. is established)
when approved under the terms of the Cooperative Airlift Agreement. Space-Available travel is
authorized aboard foreign aircraft when operating over approved channels and approved by
AMC.

                                   CARGO OPERATIONS

3.1. Purpose. Cargo operations for USAF small terminals consist primarily of aircraft loading
and offloading. The type commodity being handled will be processed according to applicable
directives for moving classified, hazardous and sensitive items.                  For detailed
onloading/offloading information and instructions concerning a specific type of aircraft, consult
the appropriate Technical Order 1C-XXX-9, Air Transportability Test Loading Activity
(ATTLA) Certification Memo, and/or AMCPAM 24-2 series, Civil Reserve Air Fleet Load
Planning Guides as necessary. Additional transportation procedural guidance exists in DTR
4500.9-R, Parts II and III and AFI 10-403.
3.2. DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest. A cargo manifest will be prepared for all DoD aircraft
carrying cargo. Use CMOS or authorized GATES as the service manifesting system to manifest
cargo. The manifest provides a complete record of the actual movement of all cargo/mail aboard
an aircraft on a particular flight or mission. Completion of DD Form 1385 (Attachment 3, DD
Form 1385, Cargo Manifest) is mandatory in the event CMOS or other automated system
failures. Refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, for manifesting procedures. Note: Small terminals
authorized to use GATES for their day-to-day operational system may use GATES as service
manifesting system to manifest cargo.
3.3. Routine Cargo Procedures. Small air terminal operations activities processing routine
cargo not associated with contingency/exercise or SAAM must refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part II or
Part III and applicable AFI references. Do not accept this type of cargo for air movement unless
it has been prepared, marked, and labeled through the local Traffic Management.
   3.3.1. Cargo Marking/Labeling. Cargo will be marked IAW Service directives and Military
   Standard (MIL-STD) 129, Department of Defense Standard Practice, Marking for Shipment
   and Storage and DTR 4500.9-R, Part II and III.
   3.3.2. Transportation Control Number (TCN). The TCN is a 17-character data element
   assigned to control and manage every shipment unit throughout the transportation pipeline.
   The TCN is unique and not duplicated. Detailed instructions for constructing TCNs are
   contained in DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Appendix L.
   3.3.3. DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling/Data Certification. A DD Form 1387-2 is
   required for classified shipments moving via military airlift or requires additional special
   handling. The DD Form 1387-2 will be completed IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 205
   and Part III, Appendix V.
   3.3.4. Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT). HAZMAT requires special attention due to the
   inherent nature of the items. Shipper’s Declaration of Dangerous Goods (SDDG) is required
   documentation needed to ship HAZMAT by military air. All personnel involved in the
   transportation of HAZMAT must be familiar and trained IAW all laws, regulations, host
   nation agreements, and other rules governing the movement of these items. Refer to
   AFMAN 24-204 IP for shipping HAZMAT by military air.

   3.3.5. NWRM. All classified and unclassified NWRM will be handled and shipped as
   classified, protected cargo. The Transportation Officer will ensure complete documentation
   is processed and completed IAW AFI 24-203.
3.4. Unit Move Documentation. The completion of shipment documentation is the
responsibility of the deploying/redeploying unit. Documentation supporting the movement of
equipment and supplies must be captured and documented IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Parts II and III.
3.5. Load Planning. Load planners receive and monitor space allocations, pre-plan cargo
movements, pre-select cargo loads, perform weight and balance, and monitor shipment age
profiles. Load planners also monitor the movement of explosives and diplomatic cargo with
approved diplomatic clearances. Load planners monitor special interest and high priority cargo
and conduct daily inventories of all outbound cargo and mail in the terminal.
3.6. Scale Calibration. Scales used to weigh cargo and mail will be calibrated in accordance
with the appropriate Technical Order, maintenance handbook, and commercial data pertaining to
each individual scale. In the absence of calibration guidance for a particular scale, scales should
be calibrated at least annually. Coordinate required calibration with nearest Technical
Measuring and Diagnostic Equipment facility or base Contracting office.
3.7. Protective Clothing/Spill Control Kits. Protective clothing/spill control kits will be
available where hazardous materials are normally handled or stored. Units may build kits using
AFMAN 24-204 IP as guidance or purchase commercial kits that meet or exceed AFMAN 24-
204 IP requirements. Units will contact base environmental or fire protection personnel to
determine adequacy and placement of commercial kits being considered. Note: Respiratory
equipment is not required in Air Freight protective clothing kits provided requirements for
respiratory equipment are coordinated with the host base medical service or emergency services.
3.8. Handling of Deceased Personnel. Shipments will move on a separate manifest, using the
manifest as a hand-to-hand receipt. Small air terminal managers will ensure on/offloading is
accomplished discreetly and in a dignified manner. Do not on/offload deceased personnel
concurrently with passengers/patients. No cargo will be loaded on top of transfer cases
containing deceased personnel. However, if more than one transfer case containing remains is
shipped or stored, stacking is permitted, but should be avoided if at all possible.
3.9. Explosives Safety. All units will establish or adhere to an explosive safety program IAW
AFMAN 91-201, AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and host base
implementation requirements during operations involving aircraft on/off-load, transportation, and
in-transit storage of explosives.
   3.9.1. Explosive training will be recorded IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program,
   AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development, and local procedures.
   3.9.2. Load team chiefs will ensure a safety/ORM briefing and safety check is conducted
   prior to the start of aircraft loading operations. (See Attachment 6, Load Team Checklist)
   Briefing topics will include, but not limited to, standard hand signals, route to aircraft, load
   team position, type and uniqueness of cargo, specific on/offloading instructions, chocking
   and use of MHE. A personal safety item check will be accomplished and include reflective
   vests/belts, gloves, ear protection devices, steel-toe boots and light wands for night time
   operations. Note: Refer to applicable AMCI 24-101, Vol 11 (Cargo and Mail Policy) CL
   for specific Engine Running Onload/Offload (ERO) Checklist.

                                           Chapter 4

                                    OTHER PROGRAMS

4.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes policies and procedures for obtaining airlift support for
movement of passengers and cargo on military or chartered aircraft. It addresses logistical
support airlift transportation requirements i.e., SAAM, OSA, JA/ATT, and validating Space
Available SAAMs. Additionally, this chapter outlines procedures for maintaining Records and
Reports.
   4.1.1. Before requesting airlift support, commanders at all levels will ensure that military
   airlift is necessary and economically feasible to satisfy their movement requirement.
   Consideration must be given to all modes of transportation. Deployment/redeployment/mid-
   phase rotation “swap outs” of personnel and equipment will be by most cost effective means
   (surface freight, dual-role, charter aircraft, commercial ticketing) that meet mission
   requirements.
   4.1.2. Units within 1,000 surface miles of the deployed location will plan to deploy and
   redeploy via surface/commercial transportation unless lack of funds are justified by the
   installation commander. Planner or user convenience is not a factor influencing the selection
   of military airlift.
4.2. Operational Support Aircraft (OSA). OSA missions are movement of high-priority space
required passengers and cargo with time, place, or mission-sensitive requirements. OSA
missions are scheduled through the USTRANSCOM Joint Operational Support Airlift Center
(JOSAC). Passengers traveling on administrative airlift or OSA need to prepare a DD Form
2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request. Passengers who are on an advance list provided
by an airlift validator and need only present their orders (these orders are not retained by
passenger service) for verification of duty status and an ID card. Terminal personnel will accept
telephone reservations from an airlift validator. Boarding passes are not required for passengers
on administrative airlift unless there is a cash transaction or checked bags; this does not
circumvent the requirements of DoD 4515.13-R. Normal processing procedures apply for
terminal add-ons. The carriage of space available passengers and cargo specifically authorized
by DoD 4515.13-R will be accommodated to the maximum extent possible. Before requesting
support airlift, commanders at all levels will ensure that military air is necessary and
economically feasible to satisfy their movement requirements. Consideration must be given to
other modes of transportation that meet mission requirements. User convenience will not be the
primary factor influencing the selection of military airlift. Refer to AFI 24-101, Passenger
Movement, for additional guidance.
4.3. Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM). SAAM support requiring special
consideration due to the number of passengers involved, the weight or size of the cargo, the
urgency or sensitivity of movement, or other special factor may request special pick-up or
delivery by AMC or theater airlift at points outside established AMC routes. Respective
MAJCOM Functional Managers are the SAAM command validators and disseminate program
guidance outlined by United States Transportation Command (USTC) and established command
unique guidance. The Command Validator will assign SAAM numbers and priorities in
accordance with DTR 4500.9-R, Part 1, appendix A.
AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013                                                             23


  4.3.1. All requests (including KC-10 and KC-135 dual role airlift) will be submitted IAW
  DTR 4500.9-R, Part l, Appendix B, Format for SAAM Request. Note: Small terminal
  managers will provide a current SAAM Requester authorization letter (January) to the
  respective MAJCOM. Letter should include requester’s name, rank, organization, office
  symbol, duty phone, fax number, and home phone. Authorization letter must be updated
  annually or earlier as needed for change of personnel. (See Attachment 5, Program Manager
  Letter) Once SAAM requesters are appointed a SAAM Request System (SRS) account will
  be established within Consolidated Air Movement Planning System (CAMPS). All requests
  must be submitted in SRS.
  4.3.1. (AETC) SAAM requester appointment letters will be updated and provided to HQ
  AETC/A4RXT NLT 31 January of each calendar year or earlier as needed for change of
  personnel.
     4.3.1.1. All unit airlift requests must be reviewed by the local Small Terminal Operations
     section prior to submission. Units submitting requests will:
     4.3.1.2. Be familiar with applicable transportation directives.
     4.3.1.3. Be able to discuss transportation issues pertinent to their units’ deployment.
     4.3.1.4. Document all travel requests.
     4.3.1.5. Submit airlift requests in a timely manner to respective MAJCOM validator.
     4.3.1.6. Passenger SAAMs will not be validated for CONUS travel with the exception of
     civic leader tours.
     4.3.1.7. For dual-role air refueling SAAMS, units must have at least six pallets of cargo
     to validate KC-10 aircraft and two pallets of cargo for KC-135 aircraft, not including
     baggage pallets. A validated air refueling (AR) requirement must be the primary means
     of validating dual role missions. Airlift is a separate process and is added to a valid dual
     role at user request if all program requirements are met. There are two means of
     satisfying AR requirements: Hard AR obtained for user by AMC Current Operations, or
     Soft AR coordination (verbal confirmation) between user and supporting flying wing.
     Satisfying AR requirements is a user responsibility. Provide all information pertaining to
     AR requirements in the “Remarks” section of request.
     4.3.1.8. Space Available (Opportune) SAAMs are used to transport unfunded Space
     Available traffic. Space Available traffic is defined as passenger and cargo traffic
     eligible for space that is surplus after all space required traffic has been accommodated.
     If funds are available for travel by any mode, an unfunded Space Available SAAM
     request cannot be submitted. Users will submit Non-Revenue Airlift (NRA) (space
     available) requests via SRS using the same procedures used for SAAMs IAW DTR 4500-
     R, Part II, Appendix Q. Passengers and cargo must meet eligibility criteria as stated in
     DoD 4515.13-R.
     4.3.1.8. (AETC) Users desiring Space Available (Opportune) SAAMs will contact HQ
     AETC/A4RXT for guidance.
         4.3.1.8.1. In billing field include “Unfunded Transportation Request.” In Remarks
         include “Unfunded Transportation Request.” Validators will pass validated requests
24                                                 AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013


         to USTC via Single Mobility System (SMS). USTC approves and provide ID number
         for NRA movements.
         4.3.1.8.2. Unfunded requests will be approved by the Wing Commander. This
         approval authority can be delegated no lower than the Vice Wing Commander. Units
         requesting unfunded support must provide a justification statement along with a
         mission impact statement citing the outcome if not supported to respective MAJCOM
         validator. The justification will contain the following statement verbatim “There are
         no funds available to move cargo or passengers by any mode of transportation.”
         Also include additional information that will assist in justifying the request to
         MAJCOM, USTC, or AMC.
     4.3.1.9. All Enroute Support Team Advanced (ESTA) SAAM’s request must match
     supported aircraft routing in the “Requirements section and require the Coronet number
     in “Remarks” section.
  4.3.2. All requests for movement under AFMAN 24-204 IP, Chapter 3 must include full
  justification in the SAAM request and a general officer endorsement. Request for movement
  under Chapter 3 provisions is for operational necessity.
  4.3.3. Allow the cargo assembly/load plan time between available to load date/time (ALD)
  and pickup (PU). The latest arrival date/time (LAD) will include flying time to destination
  from location to location. Units will reflect at least one of the following date/time in ALD,
  PU, or LAD. All entries will be stated in Greenwich Mean Time (ZULU). Date/time entries
  using “COORD” need to be coordinated between the flying wing and the user after the
  Mission Operating Directive (MOD) is published. Date and time changes could cause loss of
  support.
  4.3.4. Rapid Reaction/Hurricane Evacuation Airlift Management.
     4.3.4.1. Consider surface transportation as the primary mode to support hurricane
     evacuation plans. Installations must provide a fund site on all requests prior to
     submission.
     4.3.4.2. Due to sensitivity of Rapid Reaction SAAMs, request should be sent to
     respective MAJCOM in an expeditious manner. All Rapid Reaction SAAM requests
     should be followed up with a phone call to respective MAJCOM.
     4.3.4.3. Individuals declaring a Rapid Reaction SAAM (mission that must operate within
     96-hours) will have to answer the following questions in the “Remarks” section of the
     request:
     a) Why the mission must operate inside the 96-hour window?
     b) What is the mission impact if not supported as requested?
     c) What level of leadership is directing the requirement to operate within the 96-hour
     window? This individual will be no lower than O-7 (BG) in rank or civilian equivalent.
     Note: Any request received inside of this 96-hour window requires the Tanker Airlift
     Control Center (TACC) Commander (2 Star) or AMC Vice Commander (3 Star) approval
     before the mission will operate.
  4.3.5. Units returning from evacuation should:
AFI 24-114_AETCSUP_I 16 APRIL 2013                                                               25


       4.3.5.1. Return travel should be by surface means for cargo and Commercial Air
       Movement (CAM) for personnel.        Funding for this requirement will be unit
       responsibility.
       4.3.5.2. Submit for airlift only if an urgent need to return to home station exists;
       justification must be provided to support airlift requests for returning to home station
       (fund cite must be included). If the return mission must operate within 96-hour window
       the requesting unit will have to meet the same requirements stated in paragraph 4.3.4.3.
       Normally the priority used for return mission is significantly lower thus decreasing your
       chance for support. Funding requirements will apply to user redeployment.
   4.3.6. Denton Amendment Cargo is humanitarian cargo donated by private citizens or
   organizations that may move on space available basis on DoD assets. Joint Mobility Control
   Group (JMCG) is the responsible clearinghouse for all Denton Amendment and Space
   Available cargo lift requests. Refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, Appendix G or
   http://hatransportation.ohasis.org for guidance.
4.4. Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT). JA/ATT provides basic
airborne training and proficiency and/or continuation training for movement of passengers and
cargo by air in a joint environment. Missions authorized by JA/ATT are listed in AMC OPORD
17-76, JA/ATT. For most Air Force Units, JA/ATT Static Load C-17s, C-5s, and C-130s
provide the capability to conduct hands-on training for Wing augmentee program aircraft load
teams. Units should submit requests to respective MAJCOM validator IAW guidance provided
by their MAJCOM.
   4.4.1. Missions should be scheduled in conjunction with a local exercise to ensure optimum
   training.
   4.4.2. Aircraft for maintenance, operations, or aerial port load ground training will be used a
   minimum of 12 hours.
   4.4.3. In order to increase JA/ATT support opportunities all units should be flexible in
   regards to their training schedule. Units must plan and coordinate static load training, aircraft
   positioning and depositioning requirements in advance to meet program requirements.
   4.4.4. Units are highly encouraged to be proactive in trying to obtain JA/ATT support
   opportunities. Units should look to coordinate JA/ATT training with airlift agencies during
   the JA/ATT validation period. Contact information for flying wings can be located on the
   JA/ATT website at: https://jaatt.amc.af.mil/default.aspx. Proper coordination will prevent
   unnecessary conflicts and costly cancellations.
   4.4.5. Equipment/cargo tasked to support JA/ATT training during local exercises should be
   UTC specific and should include varied loads (i.e. bomb loaders, communication vans, and
   other unique rolling stock).
   4.4.6. All unit JA/ATT program monitors must be approved and appointed in writing by
   their respective commander. Units will forward a current JA/ATT letter (January) to
   appropriate respective MAJCOM. Letters will be updated annually or upon change of
   personnel. (see Attachment 5, Program Manager Letter)
Note: For KC-10 or KC-135 to be considered for a JA/ATT, a refueling requirement must be
tied to the mission and coordinated prior to training request.

4.5. Training Missions. Training missions are those missions that are unit-planned that support
operational training requirements primarily for aircrew but can also be in support of AE crews
and mission support functions such as aerial port, maintenance and C2 personnel. Aircrew
training missions allow opportunities to move space available passengers and opportune cargo.
These space available missions may result when minor adjustments are made to a scheduled
training mission to accommodate the airlift requirement, or when a productive aircrew-training
mission can be generated while producing the airlift.
   4.5.1. Use of aircrew training missions for logistical support will be authorized only when
   transportation is not over an established channel route or when channel route capability is
   exceeded.
   4.5.2. Respective MAJCOMs should publish their own policy and request procedures for
   this type support IAW AMCI 11-208, Tanker Airlift Operations, Chapter 8.
   4.5.3. When training missions are utilized, opportune airlift requirements stated in paragraph
   4.3.1.8. of this instruction must be met. Training missions must also be built in GDSS to
   ensure ITV can be captured for passenger and cargo.
4.6. Self-Inspection Program. Small air terminal managers will develop and execute a self-
inspection program IAW AFI 90-201, Inspector General (IG) Activities. Respective MAJCOMs
may publish additional guidelines for small terminal operations.
4.7. Information Collection, Records, and Forms. Small terminal operations management
must establish a file plan to ensure transportation documents are maintained IAW AFMAN 33-
363 and retained IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) and is available at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Documentation eligible for retirement
must be staged by 1 April each year. In case of an aircraft accident, the base nearest the scene is
responsible for initial notification. The terminal at the last station the aircraft transited will
ensure that all records for the flight are secured. Copies may be reproduced, but will only be
released at the request of a competent authority or the organization having operational control
over the aircraft.
