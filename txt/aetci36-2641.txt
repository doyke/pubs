                                             Chapter 1

                            OVERVIEW AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Overview. This publication establishes guidance and procedures for planning, developing,
validating, and reviewing resident and nonresident technical and basic military training. The
training development processes described in this instruction are part of the Instructional Systems
Development (ISD) process to analyze, design, develop, and implement training. Refer to AFI
36- 2651, Air Force Training Program, AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional Systems Development,
AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors, and AFH 36-2235, Volume 9,
Information for Designers of Instructional Systems: Application to Technical Training, for
additional guidance.
1.2. Waiver Authority. Policy and procedures are enacted to provide quality and consistency
in training and evaluation. Occasionally, unique circumstances may warrant special
consideration and possible waiver of policy provisions. At the same time, because it is important
to preserve fidelity of training, evaluation, and policy implementation throughout the command,
a process must be established for review of proposed waivers.
     1.2.1. Unless otherwise stated in this instruction, AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority for
     waivers that change the intent of the policy outlined in this instruction. (T-2) For waivers to
     unit supplements, the unit generating the supplement will identify the waiver authority to that
     supplemental guidance.
     1.2.2. Requests for waiver will be submitted by the group or wing commander through 2 AF
     to HQ AETC/A3P. (T-2) Waiver requests must:
        1.2.2.1. Identify the specific policy reference and text to be waived.
        1.2.2.2. Rationale for the waiver: Explain which of the 3 reasons listed under AFI 33-
        360, paragraph 1.9.1 apply and describe why.
        1.2.2.3. Time period or circumstance for which the waiver will be required.
        1.2.2.4. Risk mitigation measures the requesting commander will implement during the
        waiver period.
        1.2.2.5. Impact if waiver is disapproved.
     1.2.3. Units will upload approved waivers into Management Internal Control Toolset
     (MICT) for inspection activity review. Because waivers are the expression of a specific
     commander accepting risk, Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers expire 30 days after a change of
     command unless the new commander renews the waiver. For non-tiered waivers, a waiver
     remains in effect until canceled in writing by the approving official, the publication is
     revised, or the waiver expires.

                                          Chapter 2

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

2.1. Training Data Systems. AETC utilizes two separate computer-based data systems to
support training planning, development, and implementation, the Technical Training
Management System (TTMS) and the Training Planning System (TPS).
   2.1.1. TTMS is an integrated data system providing AETC users a suite of integrated and
   customized software products in a centralized, enterprise-wide, web-based architecture.
   TTMS includes the following applications:
      2.1.1.1. TTMS Student Management. This application provides the primary system of
      record used by instructors, training managers, and others to manage student accounting.
      2.1.1.2. TTMS Interactive Courseware Implementation System (ICIS). This application
      is used for course design and development within technical and basic military training.
      ICIS interfaces with Student Management to establish new courses and update existing
      courses in Student Management.
      2.1.1.3. TTMS Evaluations. This application provides automated testing capabilities and
      end-of-course surveys. The automated testing function interfaces with Student
      Management, allowing test scores to automatically flow to individual student records.
   2.1.2. TPS is used to establish new courses, course parameters, and build course schedules to
   support Air Force training requirements. Course parameters and scheduled training
   requirements are used to justify instructor and other training resource requirements.
   2.1.3. Use TTMS and TPS for all unclassified training related functions, including course
   development and delivery, instructor and student management, resource management, and
   course evaluation. If computer-based measurement is used, units must use the TTMS
   Automated Testing function.
      2.1.3.1. When developing courses that include classified information, enter all
      unclassified course information necessary to complete adequate student accounting in
      TTMS ICIS.
      2.1.3.2. TTMS and TPS automated products may be administratively edited for such
      formatting issues as column width, line spacing, white space, and font size. Changes that
      affect course parameters are not permitted.
      2.1.3.3. Locally developed automated information systems will not duplicate
      functionality found in TTMS and TPS.
2.2. Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA).
   2.2.1. ETCA contains courses conducted or administered by the Air Force, Department of
   Defense, other military services, government agencies, and security assistance programs.
   Responsibilities, procedures, and school specific information are also included. Each course
   announcement contains a description of the course and course content, course specific
   policies and procedures, and reporting instructions. Functional POCs and training managers
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                    17


   (TM) use ETCA Maintenance to maintain general and course specific information displayed
   in ETCA.
   2.2.2. ETCA Maintenance. TMs will maintain current, correct, up-to-date course POC and
   course information in ETCA.
      2.2.2.1. TMs will use ETCA Maintenance, the ETCA software user manual, and
      procedures on the ETCA website to initiate, maintain, and remove course
      announcements. TMs will also review ETCA general procedures and school specific
      information for impact to their course announcements.
      2.2.2.2. TMs will review course announcements annually in accordance with AFI 36-
      2201 and update as required. TMs will check the “update” button, whether or not
      announcement changes are required, so that the “last changed” date will update. Note:
      HQ AETC/A3PZ requires the “last changed” date as a quality review measure.
      2.2.2.3. Ensure HQ AETC/FMAM has coordinated on changes having a potential
      financial impact, such as added or deleted courses, course length and/or location changes,
      adding excess baggage, or changes in travel directions.
2.3. Training Requirements.
   2.3.1. AETC provides formal training in initial skills, advanced, supplemental, distance
   learning, and field training courses to active duty Air Force personnel, ANG, AFRC, other
   U.S. military service active duty and reserve personnel, DoD civilians, other U.S.
   government agencies, and foreign military students.
   2.3.2. Content of AETC formal training courses ranges from basic military knowledge, to
   knowledge of principles in a scientific or technical area, and complex operational and
   maintenance tasks in multiple Air Force specialties. Specialty training includes initial,
   advanced, lateral, supplemental, special, and field training.
   2.3.3. All non-prior service (NPS) enlisted personnel attend BMT prior to entering specialty
   training.
   2.3.4. AETC receives quantitative training requirements for initial skills, advanced,
   supplemental, distance learning, and field training courses from HQ USAF through multiple
   programmed guidance letters (PGL). The various PGLs are issued for each fiscal year.
      2.3.4.1. HQ USAF identifies the active duty initial skills trained personnel requirement
      (TPR) for each enlisted and officer specialty necessary to maintain operational manning
      requirements. The TPR is comprised of active duty Air Force non-prior service (NPS),
      prior service (PS), and retrainees.
      2.3.4.2. ANG, AFRC, other services, and other government agencies provide their
      training requirements to HQ USAF.
      2.3.4.3. Foreign military training requirements are provided by the respective country to
      SAF/IA.
      2.3.4.4. Together, the TPR and the training requirements from other customers make up
      total training requirements for AETC skills courses.
 18                                                            AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


   2.3.5. TMs schedule training requirements in TPS. Requirements scheduled in TPS are used
   to justify instructor and other training support resources.
   2.3.6. Foreign Military Training Requests:
      2.3.6.1. Training requests for foreign military/international students will require foreign
      disclosure review of requested training course or courses. Air Force Security Assistance
      Training (AFSAT) will notify AETC/A3T Workflow of new foreign military training
      requirements and requests for training courses where a Military Articles and Services List
      (MASL) number has not been assigned.
      2.3.6.2. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will contact appropriate TM for the requested course
      or courses.
      2.3.6.3. TM will coordinate foreign disclosure review in accordance with paragraph
      4.4.3.6.2.
      2.3.6.4. Training wing/group personnel will notify the AETC/A3T TPM of any requests
      for training received directly from a foreign source or AFSAT. The HQ AETC/A3T
      TPM will validate training request with AFSAT.
      2.3.6.5. Training group or wing ensures foreign disclosure review is accomplished if
      requirement to train foreign military/international students exists.
2.4. Course Implementation and Modification.
   2.4.1. The need to train personnel on new weapon systems, equipment, or in a new specialty
   drives the development and implementation of a new course. Existing courses are modified
   based on classification changes, occupational analysis reports (OAR), field evaluation
   questionnaire summaries (FEQS), and faculty and staff analyses.
   2.4.2. The decision to implement a new course or modify an existing one comes from a
   STRT/U&TW, training planning team (TPT) or other directive conference or working group,
   or service test or other types of feedback.
   2.4.3. BMT requirements are identified through MAJCOMs to the BMT Triennial Review
   Committee for approval. The BMT triennial review committee reviews Air Force BMT
   graduate performance, military training, military studies, initial enlisted entry training,
   curriculum course training standards, and other special interest item requirements.
   Recommendations for a new or revised CTS are based on internal or external training
   evaluation and feedback. Out of cycle requirements go through HQ AETC/A3T to HQ
   USAF/A1DL for approval.
   2.4.4. STRT/U&TWs are conducted to identify the education and training needs, develop
   and review training programs, resolve training or personnel utilization issues, and develop
   the CFETP for an Air Force Specialty. The CFETP identifies officer and enlisted specialty
   and civilian occupation life-cycle education and training requirements by skill level and/or
   duty position. See AFI 36-2201, Chapter 5, for STRT/U&TW procedures and guidance on
   CFETPs. STRT/U&TW checklist use is mandatory.
      2.4.4.1. The cryptologic and TEMPEST fields incorporate STRT/U&TW functions in
      cryptologic training advisory groups and job educational training standards.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                   19


     2.4.4.2. Primary purpose of the STRT is for the AFCFM and MAJCOM functional
     managers to determine and present training requirements to AETC. Attendees include
     AFCFM, AETC/TPM, AETC/TM, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), SMEs,
     AETC Occupational Analysis Division. The AFCFM chairs the STRT. The AETC TPM
     and TM attend as advisors.
     2.4.4.3. The U&TW is an executive decision meeting. Attendees include AFCFM,
     AETC/TPM, AETC/TM, AETC/Program Element Manager (PEM), and MFMs. The
     AFCFM and AETC/TPM co-chair the U&TW. Optional U&TW attendees include the
     AETC CDC writer and representatives from AFCDA, AETC Occupational Analysis
     Division, AFPC education, training, and classification, and the AETC instructional
     technology unit (ITU).
     2.4.4.4. U&TW attendees resolve resource issues to include: providing funding,
     instructor authorizations, equipment, and facilities to support new or revised training;
     determine which organizations will furnish resources and establish commitment and
     delivery dates; adjust training requirements if resource shortfalls cannot be resolved;
     establish training delivery dates; and finalize STS/CTS/CFETP. These decisions,
     taskings and associated suspense dates are captured in the U&TW minutes. Minutes may
     include appropriate taskings to the TRG to begin the course development process.
  2.4.5. TPTs and other conferences or working groups are convened to identify training
  requirements for courses not covered by a CFETP. Such conferences or working groups
  normally result in major changes to one or more courses that support an Air Force Specialty
  (AFS). Decisions, taskings, and associated suspense dates are captured in the meeting
  minutes. Minutes may include appropriate taskings to the TRG to begin the course
  development process.
  2.4.6. Customer feedback (without a STRT and/or U&TW) may drive existing course
  modification, as long as STS/CTS requirements are met. TMs will submit recommended
  changes to add or delete line items or to change knowledge or proficiency codes to the HQ
  AETC/A3T TPM.
     2.4.6.1. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will coordinate with and secure approval from the
     AFCFM. CTS/STS line items will not be changed without full coordination or
     STRT/U&TW action.
     2.4.6.2. Coordinate interservice course changes according to AFI 36-2230(I),
     Interservice Training.
     2.4.6.3. HQ AETC/A3T TPM maintains AFCFM coordination and proposed course
     change approval documentation.
  2.4.7. Once new or modified training standards are levied, or direction to develop or modify
  a course is established, the TM manages training development and implementation, and
  identifies resources needed to bring training online. The TM develops the course resource
  estimate (CRE) and/or course training plan (CTP), which includes start-up costs, base
  operating support (BOS), manpower, student man-years (SMY), class schedules, equipment,
  maintenance support, facilities, environmental impacts, course materials, and delivery media.
 20                                                              AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


       2.4.7.1. Use the TTMS ICIS for all new courses and revisions. If courses include
       classified information, enter only unclassified course information in accordance with
       applicable security directives.
       2.4.7.2. The course data in TTMS ICIS and TTMS Student Management must mirror
       each other, except for minor typographical or grammatical corrections, and minor plan of
       instruction (POI), lesson plan (LP), study guide/workbook, or measurement device
       technical additions or deletions.
2.5. Formal Technical Training Course Types. The 15 types of formal training described in
paragraphs 2.5.1 through 2.5.15 are used singularly or in varying combinations to meet Air Force
training needs. For information on the course numbering system go to AETC/A3PV Technical
Training Policy SharePoint site at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AE-ED-00-79/default.aspx. Note:
All types 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, A, C, W and M courses require a Training Standard, Course Chart, Plan
of Instruction (POI), Lesson Plans, Measurement Plan, and measurement devices.
   2.5.1. Type 1, Special Contract Training. Formal training of a one-time or limited nature
   contracted with civilian industrial or educational institutions, including commercial off-the-
   shelf courses. Special contract training is normally used to train selected personnel to
   operate and maintain new systems. Often personnel in training are initial cadre and AETC
   instructors who, upon completion of Type 1 training, return to their technical training wing or
   training group to develop AETC courses. See AETCI 36-2219, Type 1 Training, for specific
   information.
   2.5.2. Type 2, AETC Special Training. Formal training of a one-time or limited (1 year or
   less) nature conducted by AETC instructors at an Air Force base, other military location, or
   contractor's location. AETC special training is normally used to train personnel to operate
   and maintain new weapons or systems. Type 2 courses require all course control documents
   (POI, Lesson Plans, Course Chart, Course Training Standards), measurement plan, and
   measurement devices, a Risk Management (RM) assessment (see paragraph 4.4.3.11), and a
   foreign disclosure review, if international students will be trained (see paragraph 4.4.3.6.2).
   They do not require a CTP, do not earn manpower, and can be used to rapidly stand up a
   course when in-house resources are available.
   2.5.3. Type 3, Resident Regular Training. The most common AFS-centered formal
   training of a continuing nature conducted at an AETC base, location, or station. Resident
   regular training includes courses designed for initial training, retraining from one AFS to
   another, training on special or new equipment and procedures, advancement within an AFS,
   and initial skills multiphased Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) awarding courses.
   2.5.4. Type 4, Field Training:
       2.5.4.1. Field training is formal technical training conducted at operational locations by a
       field training detachment (FTD) or a field training team (FTT).
       2.5.4.2. The FTD mission is to qualify personnel on new equipment and in new
       techniques and procedures, increase personnel skill and knowledge, acquaint personnel
       with specific systems, keep personnel up to date on training concepts and requirements,
       and maintain individuals at given proficiency levels.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                       21


       2.5.4.3. FTTs are teams of FTD instructors who conduct training at operational bases
       without an AETC presence using that base’s facilities. Mobile training sets may be used
       to support training and usually consist of trainers, training aids, and select operational
       equipment.
   2.5.5. Type 5, Training by Other U. S. Government Agencies (Excludes Interservice
   Training Review Organizations [ITRO]). Formal training conducted by the Army, Navy,
   an Air Force agency or unit other than AETC, or other government agencies/organizations
   inside or outside of the Department of Defense (DoD). Type 5 training does not include
   ITRO consolidated or collocated training (see AFI 36-2230(I), Interservice Training) or DoD
   executive agent courses (see DoDD 5101.1, DoD Executive Agent).
   2.5.6. Type 6, DL. Formal training designed for export to students at bases of assignment
   and for students to complete without AETC course-qualified instructor on-site expertise. See
   AETCI 36-2208 and AFI 36-2201, Chapter 4, for information on interactive courseware
   development and DL.
   2.5.7. Type 7, Mobile Training Team (MTT). AETC instructors from organizations that
   typically provide Types 2, 3 and 7 training, who conduct training at an operational base using
   that base’s facilities. Mobile training sets may be used to support training and usually consist
   of trainers, training aids, and select operational equipment.
   2.5.8. Type 8, ITRO. A consolidated formal training course with the Air Force as lead
   service. Course faculty includes fair share instructor representation from participating
   services and the host service. Usually, a mixture of service personnel teach the course.
   2.5.9. Type 9, ITRO. A consolidated formal training course with another service as lead.
   Course faculty includes fair share instructor representation from participating services and
   the host service. Usually, a mixture of service personnel teach the course.
   2.5.10. Type A. DoD executive agent course with the Air Force as lead.
   2.5.11. Type B. DoD executive agent course with other than the Air Force as lead. Air
   Force students attend these courses on a quota basis.
   2.5.12. Type C, ITRO. Air Force collocated courses. These are Air Force formal training
   courses conducted on another service installation.
   2.5.13. Type D, ITRO. Other service collocated courses. These are other service courses
   conducted on an Air Force installation.
   2.5.14. Type W, Wartime Training Course. Formal training course designed to train
   different tasks and/or equipment for a wartime scenario. The wartime version of a course
   will have a different course number and require a separate build in TTMS ICIS and student
   management.
   2.5.15. Type M, Basic Military Training. BMT is initial entry training for the Air Force.
2.6. Common Training Courses. Course designation for management and resourcing of
common training embedded in multiple “feeder” courses. The common course is established for
manpower pricing purposes and for efficient use of training equipment and resources within the
training group.
2.7. Instructional System Development:
22                                                           AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


  2.7.1. Comply with instructional system development (ISD) procedures and guidelines as
  outlined in AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development, and AFH 36-2235,
  Information for Designers of Instructional Systems, Volumes 1 through 13. Use ISD to
  develop and revise all technical training and BMT instruction. Use the ISD process to ensure
  the most effective, high quality training development. HQ AETC/A8X provides guidance on
  applying ISD. Guidance is also available from HQ AETC/A5T (previously HQ AETC/A3I)
  on advanced distributed learning (ADL) and sharable content object reference model
  (SCORM) specifications and standards.
     2.7.1.1. Training programs are designed to meet user requirements and maximize
     training resource use. To determine the most effective, cost-efficient method of
     instruction, conduct a front end analysis, including media and cost benefit analysis, in
     accordance with AFH 36-2235, Volume 5, Information for Designers of Instructional
     Systems Advanced Distributed Learning: Instructional Technology and Distance
     Learning, and AETCI 36-2208. Consider various methods of training delivery, including
     IMI, DL, and technology insertions, during all course development projects and major
     revisions. Refer to AETCI 36-2208 for more information.
     2.7.1.2. Develop and deliver performance-based training as much as possible.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                        23


                                           Chapter 3

                         COURSE RESOURCE ESTIMATE (CRE)

3.1. CRE Purpose. A CRE is the initial vehicle used to seek training resource funding. It
includes resources required to initiate and sustain training through the future years defense
program (FYDP). See example in Attachment 2. Note: Type 4 courses are resourced according
to AFI 36-2201, Attachment 19, and are not required to complete a CRE.
   3.1.1. A CRE is the first document in the course control document (CCD) chain. The CRE
   is an accurate estimate for, and foundation upon which to build, the CTP, but it is not in finite
   budget or manpower/SMY detail. A CRE is submitted prior to the CTP for new courses or
   when additional resources are needed for existing courses. Resource requirements are
   refined as the CTP is finalized.
   3.1.2. Begin developing the CTP narrative and annexes while the CRE is in coordination.
   HQ AETC/A1MRT and A3RB (HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) process the CRE as a
   draft annex. Following manpower validation, HQ AETC/A1MRT and HQ AETC/A3RB-TT
   (HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) notify the HQ AETC/A3T TPM that resources have
   been identified. If resources have been identified or are available from other sources, the HQ
   AETC/A3T TPM approves the CRE and requests a CTP from the TM. Note: TMs will
   develop CTPs according to guidance in Chapter 4, and forward to the proper offices for
   approval and certification.
   3.1.3. CRE development time is within 8 weeks (40 workdays) from the date of the STRT
   minutes or tasking memo, as applicable, in accordance with AFI 36-2201. Requesting
   agencies must submit a complete set of training requirements when requesting a CRE.
   Incomplete requirements will increase CRE production time.
3.2. When To Develop a CRE. HQ AETC/A3T TPM tasks the TM to develop the CRE in
order to begin resourcing training requirements. The tasking may be through the appropriate
meeting minutes or a separate tasking memo. CREs generated for any other reason must first be
coordinated with the HQ AETC/A3T TPM. Note: Submit a CRE when additional resources are
required.
   3.2.1. The CRE should be developed before the U&TW, once clear requirements are
   identified. It should present alternative course design and delivery methodologies based on
   the known requirements and a media and cost/benefit analysis.
   3.2.2. The CRE will be vetted through the U&TW process, and selected options will be
   coordinated with HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
3.3. What To Include in the CRE. The CRE contains the following information: Note: When
developing estimations for paragraphs 3.3.1 through 3.3.12, refer to Chapter 4.
   3.3.1. Reason to develop new training or change existing training, such as an approved
   change to Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) or Air Force Enlisted
   Classification Directory (AFECD); new mission; new systems and equipment;

   personnel, training development personnel, training overhead support, BOS, and SMY for
   courses that earn manpower or have a SMY bill. Note: A SMY annualizes an authorization
   dedicated to student coverage. SMY is a method to account for pipeline or PCS course lost
   duty time for students who are in formal school training, part of the Air Force end strength,
   and are not yet available for operational unit duty. SMY tracking is used to determine
   personnel pay, housing and support. See AETCI 38-202, Education and Technical Training
   Manpower, for additional information.

   attachment to the CRE.
3.4. Coordinating CREs:
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                    25


   3.4.1. The TM or designated representative develops the CRE when tasked by HQ
   AETC/A3T TPM, accomplishes coordination with the local manpower office (MO) local
   coordination, and forwards it to the HQ AETC/A3T TPM. Note: Ensure the local
   trainer/equipment maintenance activity is included as part of the local coordination. Include
   the base civil engineer if there are facility issues in the CRE.
   3.4.2. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will coordinate the CRE with HQ AETC/A3R (for non-
   medical courses), HQ AETC/A1MRT (for non-medical courses), HQ AETC/SGU (for
   medical courses), and the AFCFM for review and approval. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will
   also coordinate with HQ AETC/A7CP if facility requirements are included in the CRE.
   Allow 30 calendar days for HQ AETC coordination.
   3.4.3. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will provide the coordinated CRE to the AFCFM 30
   calendar days prior to the U&TW, as applicable.
3.5. Funding CREs:
   3.5.1. If the course can be funded within the TRW, the TM develops the CTP according to
   Chapter 4 and submits the documentation accordingly.
   3.5.2. If not, the TM forwards the CRE to the wing/group resource manager.
      3.5.2.1. The RM confirms non-availability of local support, obtains wing/group
      approval, and returns the CRE to the TM.
      3.5.2.2. The TM emails the CRE to the HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
      3.5.2.3. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will coordinate the CRE with HQ AETC/A3RB and
      HQ AETC/A1MRT (HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) for validation of resource
      estimate. Note: If the CRE includes a memorandum from the local manpower stating
      the proposed changes have no impact, coordination with HQ AETC/A1MRT is not
      necessary.
          3.5.2.3.1. HQ AETC/A1MRT validates the manpower estimates.
          3.5.2.3.2. HQ AETC/A3RB (HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) computes the
          remaining funding obligations and generates the CRE Part II. The CRE Part II
          includes headquarters-level computed costs (e.g., TDY-to-school, instructor and
          SMY, etc.) and displays the total resource bill for AFCFM review.
      3.5.2.4. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM forwards the CRE to the AFCFM for resourcing. The
      HQ AETC/A3T TPM will establish an expiration date for the CRE. The expiration date
      will consider the POM cycle, MILCON needs, and AETC annual manpower (instructor)
      pricing cycle.
      3.5.2.5. The AFCFM notifies the HQ AETC/A3T TPM if funding is available.
      3.5.2.6. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM notifies the TM.
      3.5.2.7. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will follow up with the AFCFM at least quarterly
      until the CRE is funded or the expiration date is reached. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will
      update the TM.
      3.5.2.8. The AFCFM contacts the HQ AETC/A3T TPM when funding is approved.

      3.5.2.9. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM instructs the TM to proceed with CTP development,
      and courtesy-copies HQ AETC/A1MRT, and HQ AETC/A3R.
      3.5.2.10. If funding is not available or not approved, the AFCFM, HQ AETC/A3T TPM,
      HQ AETC/A3R (for non-medical courses), HQ AETC/SGU (for medical courses), and
      TM initiate an out-of-cycle request or look for workarounds until the CTP can be
      developed. Note: A CTP will not be approved without workarounds/alternatives that
      satisfy the funding requirements.
3.6. Resourcing enlisted medical courses developed and taught on METC:
   3.6.1. Enlisted medical courses developed and taught on METC are considered Type 5
   training. METC has academic oversight for curriculum development and delivery.
   3.6.2. HQ AETC/A3T TPM provides METC with training requirements for each course.
   3.6.3. METC conducts a curriculum review and develops a resource estimate.
   3.6.4. METC provides the resource estimate to HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
   3.6.5. HQ AETC/A3T TPM, working with HQ AETC/SGU, validates the resource estimate.
      3.6.5.1. If HQ AETC/A3T TPM and HQ AETC/SGU concur with the resource estimate,
      the HQ AETC/A3T TPM forwards the estimate to the AFCFM for resourcing.
      3.6.5.2. If HQ AETC/A3T TPM and/or HQ AETC/SGU non-concur with the resource
      estimate, HQ AETC/A3T TPM will work with METC to resolve any issues. HQ
      AETC/A3T TPM will work with the AFCFM if changes to training requirements are
      necessary to resolve resourcing issues. HQ AETC/A3T TPM will provide a revised
      resource estimate to the AFCFM for resourcing, as applicable.
   3.6.6. Once all resourcing has been validated and funding approved, HQ AETC/A3T TPM
   instructs the TM to develop the training plan, as appropriate.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                    27


                                          Chapter 4

                                     TRAINING PLANS

4.1. Purpose.
   4.1.1. The training plan is the primary resourcing document for planning, programming, and
   implementing training. The plan is based on implementation year training requirements. It is
   the justification for using current and future resources and acquiring additional resources
   necessary to conduct the specified training in a course or courses.
   4.1.2. The training plan outlines the actions necessary to bring new or revised training on
   line. The training plan contains the training standard and proposed course outline; addresses
   security and foreign disclosure restrictions; defines in detail the course parameters; the
   resources required, such as facilities, equipment, manpower, etc.; and the actions needed to
   acquire the resources to accomplish the training. It is a refined and accurate statement of
   resources required to support a course as compared to the estimate in the CRE.
   4.1.3. Two types of training plans are used for technical and basic military training, the
   course training plan (CTP) and the abbreviated training plan (ATP). Note: Phase II medical
   training programs are conducted at various medical treatment facilities in accordance with
   AFI 41-105, Medical Training Programs. These programs will have a course training plan if
   the programs consume SMYs (see paragraph 4.2.2.1.).
      4.1.3.1. A CTP is used for new courses, changing the AFSC of an existing course,
      changing the training type on an existing course, or transferring an existing course from
      one location/base to another. A CTP may also be used for management and resourcing of
      common training embedded in multiple “feeder” courses. Common course CTPs
      supplement “feeder” course CTPs.
      4.1.3.2. An ATP is used to update an existing CTP when changes to the course impact
      resources or any annex to the CTP. Note: An ATP is not required for editorial changes
      to training standards and/or course charts that do not alter course content or impact
      resources.
4.2. Courses Requiring Training Plans:
   4.2.1. Training plans are required for all Type 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, C, M, and W courses.
   Note: For 982 TRG courses, refer to paragraph 4.4.4. for additional information.
   4.2.2. Type 5, B, and D courses normally do not require training plans unless:
      4.2.2.1. The course consumes SMYs (see paragraph 3.3.3.) but does not earn AETC
      instructors or affect other AETC resources. A CTP is submitted that includes a narrative
      and the SMY calculation sheet developed by the local MO. That calculation sheet will
      include C/L instructor hours, course length-manpower days, course length-manpower
      hours, shift group limit, programmed group size, minimum group size, maximum group
      size, expansion group size and any minimum manning or washbacks. Courses that fall
      into this category are usually taught at DoD schools and instructors are not provided by
      AETC.
 28                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


      4.2.2.2. The course earns AETC instructors due to Air Force student load and consumes
      SMYs. In this case, a CTP is submitted that includes a narrative, manpower annex, and
      SMY calculation sheet. Exception: For Type 5 courses developed and taught on the
      Medical Education and Training Campus (METC), a CTP is submitted that includes a
      narrative, resource requirements analysis (RRA), and SMY calculation sheet.
      4.2.2.3. The course earns AETC instructors due to Air Force student load, but does not
      consume SMYs. In this case, a CTP is submitted that includes a narrative and a
      manpower annex. Exception: For Type 5 courses developed and taught on the Medical
      Education and Training Campus (METC), a CTP is submitted that includes a narrative,
      and a resource requirements analysis (RRA).
      4.2.2.4. A course that did not initially earn AETC instructors or impact AETC resources
      may develop an instructor or resource impact after the Air Force student load exceeds a
      certain level. When this happens, AETC manpower receives an instructor bill from the
      host service or agency.
          4.2.2.4.1. Manpower will then notify the HQ AETC/A3T TPM and the local MO a
          training plan is required.
          4.2.2.4.2. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will task the TM to develop and submit a CTP.
          TRGs have 30 working days from the date notified to submit the CTP. Manpower
          will not pay the bill until the training plan is submitted, validated, and certified.
          Note: Anytime there is a specific manpower requirement, such as specific grade or
          AFSC, identified in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) or a memorandum of
          understanding (MOU), include the MOA or MOU as part of the training plan.
4.3. When to Develop a CTP or Abbreviated Training Plan (ATP): Note: Prior to
developing CTP/ATP, TRGs will work with local manpower to determine if proposed changes
impact manpower requirements and local logistics and maintenance organizations to verify if
proposed changes impact AETC programmed training operations support and/or sustainment
costs. Coordinating offices will provide the TRG with a memorandum stating the proposed
changes do or do not impact their respective resource area.
   4.3.1. Develop a CTP to implement courses supporting new training (i.e., new weapon
   system, new advanced or supplemental course within an AFSC, new AFSC, etc.), when
   changing the AFSC of an existing course (i.e., 2E2X1 to 3D0X1), changing the training type
   on an existing course (i.e., Type 2 to Type 3, Type 3 to Type 6, etc.), and when transferring
   an existing course from one location/base to another (i.e., Sheppard to Lackland, Lackland to
   Fort Lee, etc.).
   4.3.2. Develop an ATP to update an existing CTP when changes to the course impact
   resources (i.e., course length, SMY, manpower, equipment, facilities, funding, etc.) or any
   annex to the CTP (i.e., security, safety, motivational training, risk management, etc.). Note:
   An ATP is not required for editorial changes to training standards and/or course charts that
   do not alter course content or impact resources.
   4.3.3. The ATP includes a summary of changes and any updated/changed annexes.
4.4. Training Plan Format and Content:
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                    29


  4.4.1. Use the training plan format in TTMS ICIS. The CTP consists of a narrative and
  applicable annexes that justify and support resource requirements and detail plan schedules.
  Complex annexes may be divided into appendices for clarity. The ATP includes a narrative
  describing the changes to the original CTP and all updated annexes, as applicable. Note:
  Do not include classified documents/information in the training plan. Instead, identify a
  POC and provide instructions on how to request classified documents/information.
     4.4.1.1. Refer to paragraphs 4.4.4. for specific training plan format and content for 982
     TRG courses.
     4.4.1.2. For common training courses, show the common course number (usually an
     ATR course number) and all “feeder” courses on the front cover of the CTP/ATP.
     4.4.1.3. For medical courses, Air Force-only Medical Officer courses, medical readiness
     courses, and common training courses such as Expeditionary Medical Readiness follow
     normal procedures for training plan format and content. Enlisted medical courses
     developed and taught on the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) are
     considered Type 5 courses. Refer to paragraphs 4.2.2 through 4.2.2.4.2. for Type 5
     training plan content.
  4.4.2. Narrative. Provides an overview of information in the annexes and appendices. It
  describes planned course rationale, assumptions, and conditions. Identify any piggyback or
  “feeder” courses in the narrative, including their course numbers. Piggyback courses must be
  reflected on the mother course’s course chart and the manpower pricing record. The
  narrative includes specific paragraphs addressing the following topics:
     4.4.2.1. Course Data. Include the following information:
         4.4.2.1.1. Reason for Development. Explain the reason for developing the course
         and training plan, such as an STRT/U&TW, FEQS, AFS change, or AFCFM
         feedback. Provide a brief description of the changes to the course, such as addition or
         deletion of training requirements, new or replaced equipment, etc. Include the
         planned training implementation date.
         4.4.2.1.2. Course Description. Provide a brief description of the subject matter,
         equipment, or system for which training will be provided. For common training
         courses, ensure the description identifies the course as being for management and
         resourcing purposes only. Describe how the common training fits into all the
         “feeder” courses. Describe reasons for use of modified training day, if applicable.
         4.4.2.1.3. Instructional Design. Identify the course instructional design, as shown on
         the course chart. Summarize the media and cost benefit analysis results leading to the
         instructional design decision.
         4.4.2.1.4. Security Classification. Include instructional material classification and
         control, if appropriate, and the point in the course at which trainees must have a
         security clearance, if required. Note: Course classification will equal the highest
         classification of material or information disseminated to the students
         4.4.2.1.5. Foreign Disclosure. Include a foreign disclosure disclaimer if foreign
         military/international students are to be trained. Examples: (1) “Foreign Disclosure:
         This course contains information which may not be disclosed to international students
30                                                            AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


        without proper authorization. Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum in the
        security annex for further information.” (2) “Foreign Disclosure: The information in
        this course is not restricted and may be disclosed to international students. Refer to
        the foreign disclosure memorandum in the security annex for further information.”
     4.4.2.2. Control Documents. The narrative’s course control documents consist of the
     training standard (either an STS or a CTS) and the course chart.
        4.4.2.2.1. Training Standard. Provide a brief summary of major STS and/or CTS
        changes that affect resources and the current development status (straw man, draft,
        final, etc.). If resource constraints prevent complete STS or CTS implementation,
        describe constraints and applicable interim and long term action(s) to correct
        deficiencies. Include workarounds and a projected STS or CTS full implementation
        date. Specific training standard line items are identified with a slash (/) until
        programmed resources are available. Note: Common training courses using a CTS
        will identify all “feeder” courses.
        4.4.2.2.2. Course Chart. Briefly summarize major course chart changes that affect
        resources and describe the course chart development status. If applicable, summarize
        the impact on Type 3 enlisted and officer initial skill-awarding course wartime course
        parameters. Note: Ensure piggyback courses are reflected on the mother course’s
        course chart. For common training courses, identify all “feeder” courses in the
        Remarks section.
     4.4.2.3. Total Programmed Entries and Scheduling Constraints. Specify total
     programmed entries for the FY when the course will be implemented, and briefly
     describe course parameters, class or student scheduling constraints, such as group sizes or
     minimum interval. Use TRQI requirements from the current fiscal year (FY) pricing
     baseline, including NPS student programmed attrition, as the total programmed entries
     baseline. Describe in this section other actions necessary to accommodate foreign
     military/international students (such as computer access authorization processes). Note:
     If foreign military/international students will be trained, ensure a foreign disclosure
     memorandum is included as part of the security annex.
     4.4.2.4. Manpower Authorizations and Personnel Specifications:
        4.4.2.4.1. Manpower Authorizations. Provide a brief description of manpower
        required to support, develop, and conduct the course as identified on the course
        evaluation data sheet (CEDS). Refer to AETCI 38-202, Education and Technical
        Training Manpower, for more information on the CEDS. Summarize the overall
        impact to manpower requirements such as increases/decreases in instructors and
        SMY. For more information on SMYs, see paragraph 3.3.3 . Work manpower
        authorizations with local MO, HQ AETC/SGU (medical courses), and TRS resources,
        as applicable, to ensure availability. Consider SMYs when addressing all initial skill
        courses and all courses that are 100 academic days or longer in this portion of the
        narrative. Ensure piggyback courses are reflected on the mother course’s manpower
        pricing record. Note: TRG overhead and support authorizations, such as TMs,
        training developers, training resources, and training evaluators, are based on Air
        Force approved manpower standards. HQ AETC/A1MRT applies these standards
        and assigns earned authorizations. If earned authorizations necessary for support and
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                       31


        development of training are not available, funded authorizations may be reallocated
        across the TRGs based on the criticality of the current training priorities. Remaining
        shortfalls will be reviewed for possible inclusion in the program objective
        memorandum (POM).
        4.4.2.4.2. Personnel Specifications. Specify and explain any factors that affect
        personnel selection, such as field experience, security clearances, educational
        requirements, special experience identifiers (SEI), specific grade requirements,
        previous training, and physical requirements.

     Note: BMT manpower requirements are earned on a separate Air Force manpower
     standard (AFMS). The BMT training plan does not require a manpower annex if
     instructor contact hours do not change. If instructor contact hours change, a manpower
     annex and adjustments to the manpower standard are required.
        4.4.3.2.1. The Base MO develops and furnishes the manpower data for inclusion in
        the manpower annex. The manpower annex consists of the course manpower
        standard data and pricing record, CEDS, annotated basic authorization (BA) (for
        nonstandard BA), washback calculation sheet/reports (as applicable), AETC Form
        896, Lockstep/Multitrack Course Evaluation Data, (as applicable), and MIR
        worksheet including MIR justification (as applicable). The Base MO will initiate the
        request for a new Organizational Structure Code (OSC), as necessary.
        4.4.3.2.2. MIR requirements will be based on equipment, safety, supervision, span of
        control, and related factors determined during the task analysis and validation of the
        course. The TM provides detailed justification, to include photographs, diagrams,
        technical order references, etc., as necessary to support all MIR requirements. Note:
        Use applicable risk assessments to support MIR when developing justification.
        4.4.3.2.3. Complete justification for minimum manning requirement (MMR) is
        included in the CEDS.
        4.4.3.2.4. The MO and school commander or representative (usually the TM) signs
        the course priceout. The course priceout includes a justification section to document
        offset use requests from other courses or sources, courses being replaced, and BA
        actions desired. This section is also the area to summarize course overall manpower
        impact.
        4.4.3.2.5. Manpower annex development requires cooperation between the MO and
        TM, with the TM providing new course parameter data. Manpower studies and/or
        data validation may be necessary for an accurate determination of necessary
        manpower resources. Note: See Attachment 3 for more information on the
        manpower decision process.
     4.4.3.3. Facilities Annex. Address the following areas, as appropriate:

   under Access Control – Training Manager. Refer to the paragraph 2.5 for more information
   on course types and the course numbering system. Note: A new course number and PDS
   code are not required to update an existing course. Refer to para 4.3.1. for examples of
   situations requiring a new course number and PDS code.
      4.5.3.1. For initial skills courses, a “new course” is defined as a change in the 5 digit
      enlisted or 4 digit officer AFSC identifier within the course number, such as 2E231 in
      course number E3ABR2E231 00AA. Example: A new PDS code is required when
      E3ABR2E231 XXXX changes to E3ABR3D031 XXXX.
      4.5.3.2. The PDS code request automatically flows to HQ AETC/A3P for approval and
      assignment of the PDS code to the new course number.
      4.5.3.3. When Air Force officer and enlisted personnel attend the same initial skills
      course (piggyback course), separate course numbers and course builds are required.
      Advanced and supplemental courses attended by both officer and enlisted personnel do
      not require separate course numbers or course builds. Identify the course based on the
      predominate type of student attending.
   4.5.4. For course transfers, see paragraph 4.7 for information on updating TPS.
   4.5.5. TM will complete a course announcement in ETCA for new courses and will update
   existing course announcements, as applicable.
   4.5.6. TM begins developing the training plan. Develop the course control documents and
   the appropriate annexes, such as manpower and personnel, facilities, logistics, comptroller,
   security, interservice training review, environmental assessment, safety, motivational
   training, and risk management, as applicable. Note: When used, the motivational training
   annex must be routed through the TRW/CC and 2 AF/CC prior to sending to HQ AETC/A3T
   for approval by HQ AETC/A2/3/10. This routing is separate from and accomplished prior to
   routing the approved training plan.
   4.5.7. TM forwards the applicable annexes to the respective local agencies for review and
   coordination per local guidance. Work all annexes with the local agencies at the same time.
   Note: TMs will suspense and follow up, as necessary, with applicable local agencies to
   ensure a timely response and meet training plan timelines.
   4.5.8. TM assembles the training plan, establishes the planned implementation date, and
   finalizes the narrative.
   4.5.9. TM forwards the coordinated training plan to the TRG resources chief.

  4.5.10. The TRG resources chief validates resources availability and forwards to the TRG
  Training Director.
  4.5.11. The TRG Training Director reviews the training plan for compliance with policy
  requirements and forwards to the TRG commander.
  4.5.12. The TRG commander or designated representative approves the training plan.
  Approval signifies that all applicable local agencies have reviewed and approved their
  respective annexes, and that resources required to support the planned implementation date
  have been identified.
  4.5.13. The TRG returns the approved training plan to the TM for final coordination.
  4.5.14. The TM emails the approved training plan to the local MO for review and
  coordination. The MO compares course parameters in TPS with the parameters stated in the
  training plan.
  4.5.15. The local MO and TM work together to resolve any discrepancies in the training
  plan.
  4.5.16. The local MO prepares a memorandum summarizing any manpower impacts,
  attaches the memorandum to the approved training plan, and emails the complete package to
  HQ AETC/A1MRT with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/A3T TPM no later than 60 days prior
  to course implementation date.
  4.5.17. HQ AETC/A3T TPM will coordinate all training plans involving interservice
  training with HQ AETC/A3TI.
  4.5.18. HQ AETC/A1MRT validates manpower and SMY resource needs. If discrepancies
  are found, HQ AETC/A1MRT will return the training plan to the local MO for resolution
  with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/A3T TPM. Once all discrepancies have been resolved,
  HQ AETC/A1MRT forwards a recommendation to HQ AETC/A3RB-TT (HQ AETC/SGU
  for medical courses), with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
  4.5.19. HQ AETC/A3RB-TT (HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) reviews and validates
  the resource impact (O&M start-up costs, substantial recurring costs, etc.) and sends a
  recommendation for certification to HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
  4.5.20. If the training plan impacts officer or enlisted initial skills courses, HQ AETC/A3T
  TPM will forward the training plan to AFPC (officer courses) or 2 AF Detachment 1
  (enlisted courses) for review of any impact to the accession plan. AFPC or 2 AF Detachment
  1 will notify the HQ AETC/A3T TPM of any impact to the accession plan. Note: The HQ
  AETC/A3T TPM should follow-up with AFPC or 2 AF Detachment 1, as applicable, within
  two days of forwarding the training plan, however, do not delay certification of the training
  plan awaiting a response.
  4.5.21. HQ AETC/A3T TPM prepares the certification memorandum for HQ AETC/A3T
  signature.
  4.5.22. After HQ AETC/A3T signature, the HQ AETC/A3T TPM forwards the signed
  certification memorandum to the TRG commander with a courtesy copy to HQ
  AETC/FMAM, HQ AETC/FMAT, HQ AETC/A1MRT, HQ AETC/A3RB-TT (non-medical
  courses only), HQ AETC/A3TI (interservice training courses only), HQ AETC/SGU
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                     41


   (medical courses only), 2 AF/TTOC, the local MO, TRS commander, and TM.                 Note:
   Courses will not be implemented until the training plan has been certified.
   4.5.23. The TM prepares AETC Form 179A, Course Training Schedule for Allocations, and
   forwards to 2 AF/TTOC, if required (refer to paragraph 4.7.5.).
   4.5.24. Upon receipt of the certification memorandum, HQ AETC/A1MRT activates the
   course in TPS.
   4.5.25. The TM activates the course in TTMS and flows the course to TTMS student
   management.
   4.5.26. 2 AF/TTOC releases class schedules.
4.6. Training Plan Process for Standardized Faculty Development Courses:
   4.6.1. The prime faculty development unit will develop the standardized training plan for the
   assigned courses and coordinate with the collateral units for applicable collateral annexes to
   the training plan.
      4.6.1.1. Collateral faculty development units will provide the necessary annexes to
      assemble the standardized course training plan. Annexes from collateral units will be
      coordinated through their training director before being submitted to the prime faculty
      development unit for inclusion in the standardized training plan.
      4.6.1.2. The prime faculty development unit will assemble the standardized training plan
      with the annexes from all collateral units and forward the completed training plan to the 2
      AF faculty development functional manager for coordination and approval. The
      completed training plan will be coordinated through the training directors and approved
      by the 2 AF faculty development functional manager.
      4.6.1.3. The 2 AF faculty development functional manager will return the approved
      training plan to the prime faculty development unit. The prime faculty development unit
      will process the approved training plan for certification according to paragraph 4.5.14.
   4.6.2. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will certify the course training plan and provide a copy of
   the certification memorandum to the functional manager and the prime faculty development
   unit.
4.7. Move Course to Student Management and Activate New or Revised Course:
   4.7.1. TM must move course data from TTMS ICIS to the student management database and
   activate the course in student management no later than 30 days prior to course
   implementation date.
   4.7.2. The TM will validate the project in TTMS ICIS to ensure all information is correct
   before moving the data to student management.
   4.7.3. Carefully plan and time the move of a new or revised course from TTMS ICIS to the
   student management database. Pay specific attention to the fact that the TTMS ICIS start
   date (minimum 30 calendar days from the move) will become the revision date, before which
   TTMS will not allow class start dates.
   4.7.4. Before moving a course from TTMS ICIS to the student management database, delete
   student status history from classes that will be converted to the new/revised course.
42                                                              AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


  4.7.5. If HQ AETC/A3T does not certify the training plan (or delays certification for an
  extended period), or the course fails to materialize, the TM will deactivate and/or delete the
  course from the student management database. Users must manually check to ensure
  information is correct and prevent conflicts with other systems. See the TTMS ICIS
  handbook on the TTMS website for specific information required for course transfer to
  student management.
  4.7.6. The TM sends the AETC Form 179A to the appropriate 2 AF/TTOC program
  manager to request release of the class schedule for the new or revised course. In addition to
  the request for course conversion and the effective date, the AETC Form 179A will include
  the course revision date in the TTMS student management database, and confirmation that
  the newly revised course is active. Classes cannot be conducted before the certified training
  plan implementation date (not applicable to Type 4 courses).
  4.7.7. For Type 2 courses, the TM inputs course parameters into TPS, establishes a
  discontinuation date (no longer than 1 year), builds the course in TTMS ICIS, moves the
  course data to the TTMS student management database, and emails the HQ AETC/A3T
  TPM. A training plan is not required. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will coordinate with HQ
  AETC/A3RB-TT, and email HQ AETC/A1MRT to request the course be activated in TPS.
  HQ AETC/A1MRT activates the course based on HQ AETC/A3T TPM email.
  4.7.8. For Type 5 courses not requiring a training plan, the TM inputs course parameters into
  TPS, builds the course in TTMS ICIS, moves the course date to the TTMS student
  management database, and emails the HQ AETC/A3T TPM. The HQ AETC/TPM will
  coordinate with HQ AETC/A3RB-TT, and email HQ AETC/A1MRT to request the course
  be activated in TPS. HQ AETC/A1MRT activates the course based on HQ AETC/A3T TPM
  email.
  4.7.9. When a new course is activated and the schedule released, the TM notifies
  customers/course users the course is available and solicits their training requirements.
4.8. Move Course to Student Management Within 30 Calendar Days of Class Start
Date: Note: Does not apply to Type 4 courses.
  4.8.1. When TM moves a new course or course revision from TTMS ICIS to Student
  Management, the Student Management database forces a conversion date a minimum of 30
  calendar days prior to the course start or conversion date. For those isolated, but urgent cases
  when TMs must start or convert a course within 30 calendar days of implementation, a
  waiver is required to adjust a course revision date, allowing center-generated classes
  following course conversion implementation. Note: TM will validate the project in TTMS
  ICIS prior to moving the course to Student Management.
  4.8.2. The TM will email HQ AETC/A3PZ, with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/A3T TPM
  and the TRG/CC, to justify and request waiver to implement the course at the higher urgency
  level.
  4.8.3. HQ AETC/A3PZ is the waiver approval authority to move courses within the 30-day
  window.
  4.8.4. HQ AETC/A3PZ or a designee notifies the HQ AETC/A5TT TTMS program
  management office (PMO) when a move is approved.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                        43


   4.8.5. HQ AETC/A5TT instructs the TTMS customer support to proceed with the move.
   Note: Customer support will take direction only from HQ AETC/A5TT, the TTMS PMO, or
   the TTMS central customer support.
4.9. Transferring Courses between TRW/TRG.
   4.9.1. When courses transfer from one TRW or TRG to another, the gaining TM will obtain
   the required equipment, training standard, CC, POI and/or syllabus, lesson plans, tests, and
   training materials from the TM at the losing site.
   4.9.2. The gaining TM makes the appropriate changes in TPS to the course number and
   location if the course parameters remain the same. If the course parameters change, the
   gaining TM will load the new parameters in TPS.
   4.9.3. The losing TM will discontinue the old course after the last student graduates and all
   student accounting updates have been completed.
   4.9.4. The gaining TM will use TTMS ICIS to make appropriate changes to training
   standards, course charts, and POIs, as applicable. Pen-and-ink changes may be used to
   correct administrative errors if changes do not affect course resources or content. Ensure the
   TTMS ICIS is updated to reflect any pen-and-ink changes. Note: Updates reflecting pen-
   and ink changes do not need to flow to the TTMS student management database until the
   next revision.
   4.9.5. The gaining TM will develop and coordinate a training plan for the transferred course,
   ensuring all necessary annexes reflect the appropriate documentation for the new TRW,
   TRG, or location, as applicable.
   4.9.6. Once HQ AETC/A1MRT activates the course in TPS, the TM uses AETC Form 179A
   to notify 2 AF/TTOC when the course is ready to convert and schedule. The TM prepares
   class schedules in TPS and validates and distributes allocations. The first class start date will
   be at least 30 days after the conversion date.
4.10. Course Cancellation/Discontinuation.
   4.10.1. TM initiates course cancellation or discontinuation requests using AETC Form 1,
   Course Cancellation/Discontinuation. Route the request as indicated on the AETC Form 1
   to HQ AETC/A3T. Note: The decision to not implement a course that has been developed
   will be considered cancelling the course and require an AETC Form 1 be submitted to HQ
   AETC/A3T. Course cancellation procedures do not apply to Type 4 courses.
   4.10.2. HQ AETC/A3T is the final approval authority for course cancellations or
   discontinuation.
   4.10.3. After HQ AETC/A3T provides final disposition on the request:
      4.10.3.1. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM informs the AFCFM and distributes the completed
      discontinuation form to HQ AETC/A1MRT, HQ AETC/A3RB-TT, HQ AETC/A3TI
      (ITRO courses only), HQ AETC/FMAM, HQ AETC/FMAT, HQ AETC/SGU (for
      medical courses), AFSAT, 2 AF/TTOC, and the TM.
      4.10.3.2. TMs update ETCA and TTMS accordingly.

                                           Chapter 5

                                  TRAINING STANDARDS

5.1. Training Standards. Two types of training standards are used to support technical and
basic military training courses, the specialty training standard (STS) and the course training
standard (CTS).
5.2. Specialty Training Standards (STS). An STS describes an Air Force Specialty in terms
of tasks and knowledge Airmen in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on the
job. An STS also serves as a contract for training between AETC and its customers, showing
which of the overall training requirements are taught in formal schools and correspondence
courses.
   5.2.1. Requirements. An STS is required in each enlisted CFETP. It identifies core tasks
   and knowledge necessary for AFS career progression and standardizes Air Force training
   requirements. STS use is optional in officer CFETPs. Use the TTMS STS template when
   developing new or revising an existing STS.
   5.2.2. Approval. The AFCFM approves an STS only after customer requirement and
   provider (AETC) capability differences are resolved. Refer to AFI 36-2201, Chapter 5 for
   more information.
   5.2.3. References. Technical references are normally limited to Air Force, DoD, or other
   government publications. Use of commercial publications must be specifically approved by
   the AFCFM.
   5.2.4. Functions. The STS serves the following minimum functions:
       5.2.4.1. Specifically describes the user-command, mission-related training required of
       specialties listed in enlisted and officer classification publications. List tasks and
       knowledge as either proficiency codes or behavioral statements specific to required tasks
       and knowledge.
       5.2.4.2. Identifies level of training provided in initial skill, wartime, and other AFSC-
       awarding courses, but does not include generic leadership and management training
       requirements, which are satisfied through officer accession and professional military
       education (PME) programs.
       5.2.4.3. Identifies CDC requirements or study references if CDCs are unavailable.
       5.2.4.4. Identifies upgrade and qualification training, and SKT and training references.
       5.2.4.5. Reference used by supervisors to evaluate formal school graduates.
       5.2.4.6. Identifies minimum AFS OJT requirements for each skill level and/or duty
       position. Provides a foundation for OJT program job qualification standards (JQS) and
       qualification training package (QTP) development. Lists OJT training tasks as “go” or
       “no-go.” "Go" means an individual has the proficiency, knowledge, and experience to
       perform tasks without supervision, and meets the task standard.
   5.2.5. STS Preparation. The STS is published as an integral part of the CFETP. Refer to
   AFI 36-2201, Chapter 5, for guidance on developing the STS.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                      45


  5.2.6. Preparing STS Training Tasks:
     5.2.6.1. Use notes to cover AFS-unique situations. Example: If “wartime elements” has
     an asterisk, explain in a note.
     5.2.6.2. During the STRT/U&TW or when coordinating a draft STS, identify line items
     that will continue to be taught during wartime. They may be identified by an asterisk left
     of the paragraph or subparagraph number, in a separate STS column, or as a separate
     attachment to the STS.
     5.2.6.3. In column 1, list the most commonly performed tasks or required knowledge for
     the most current specialty description duties. Complete the list before assigning resident
     training and CDC content proficiency codes.
        5.2.6.3.1. Have SMEs examine each AFS duty, as listed in the specialty summary
        and under duties and responsibilities. If the STS pertains to all 3-skill levels, consider
        the duties in each AFS description. If an OAR is available, list all first job tasks, as
        well as 5- and 7-skill level tasks, according to the analysis extract forwarded with the
        OAR.
        5.2.6.3.2. Use SME input to determine if duties should be added or deleted because
        of job performance requirements changes. Document variations from current
        specialty descriptions, and identify those when coordinating the draft training
        standard.
        5.2.6.3.3. Use SME input to list job tasks under each duty. Subtasks may also be
        listed. To help ensure complete coverage, compare the initial SME grouping of tasks
        to the STS and task matching in the OAR training extract STS factor printout.
        5.2.6.3.4. Use OAR data, when available, to determine which tasks are performed at
        each AFS skill level. Consider including tasks performed or knowledge required by
        30 percent or more of the personnel in each AFS skill level. For specialties where 30
        percent is unrealistic, establish an alternate cutoff point, and maintain supporting
        rationale in the STS record set folder.
        5.2.6.3.5. Use OAR data to determine if because of task difficulty, safety factors, or
        training emphasis ratings, tasks performed by less than 30 percent should be included
        in the list. Include in the STS column 1, regardless of percent performing.
        5.2.6.3.6. Use SME AFS knowledge to organize and list column 1 duties and tasks
        for OJT use.
        5.2.6.3.7. Provide rationale (OAR data, evaluation feedback, or user input) to support
        STS column 1 entries. TMs will retain the data with the course record set so that
        others, such as new course personnel, understand the course content rationale, and as
        the basis to develop course objectives. Training decision rationale can be
        documented in the STS factor printout.
     5.2.6.4. Write clear task and knowledge statements. The SME and training specialist
     determine how detailed statements will be. List subtasks for complex tasks that segment
     performance and training into subtasks (not teaching steps), but do not divide beyond the
     subtask level. Conversely, task statements that are too general do not provide enough
     information.
46                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


        5.2.6.4.1. Do not use subject knowledge statements for task knowledge or
        performance, and do not use task statements for subject knowledge items. Normally,
        performance line items begin with verbs and subject knowledge line items begin with
        nouns. Note: If closely related tasks are listed separately, but will be taught together,
        code them at the same proficiency level.
        5.2.6.4.2. Begin task statements with action verbs, such as “operate,” “write,” or
        “clean.” Use one verb per task statement (unless an additional verb helps clarify the
        task) to enable the OJT trainer to sign off one task at a time. Two closely related
        tasks that are accomplished simultaneously should be taught simultaneously and can
        be listed as a single line item. Otherwise, list tasks separately.
        5.2.6.4.3. Write active sentences that describe what the person must do to perform a
        task (Example: Use "Calibrate XYZ" rather than "Perform XYZ calibration"). The
        implied subject is understood.
            5.2.6.4.3.1. Avoid redundant or qualifying phrases, such as "in accordance with
            local directives," "when appropriate," or "as required."
            5.2.6.4.3.2. Avoid vague or ambiguous words, such as "know," "understand," or
            "determine."
            5.2.6.4.3.3. Use “such as” followed by two or three specific examples for
            clarification. Avoid "and/or" or "etc."
            5.2.6.4.3.4. Use simple statements without qualifiers. Examples: “Operate
            power saw" rather than "Operate power saw to cut framing timbers" and "Inspect
            records" rather than "Inspect records for completeness and accuracy". Qualifiers
            are acceptable if necessary for clarification.
            5.2.6.4.3.5. Avoid task statements that include multiple objects. Example:
            "Check the fire detection system" rather than "Check the fire detection,
            extinguishing, and overheat warning systems".
            5.2.6.4.3.6. Course developers may combine closely related or similar tasks when
            developing course objectives.
     5.2.6.5. When a subject is complex and includes information that is not required for the
     AFS, identify which part of the subject is required. Subject knowledge statements
     identify fundamental and theoretical knowledge required for job performance, such as
     pneudraulic principles or principles of accounting.
        5.2.6.5.1. Subject knowledge statements do not include action verbs unless they are
        necessary to more specifically describe the knowledge requirement. If an action verb
        is necessary, use only one per statement.
        5.2.6.5.2. Avoid ambiguous knowledge statements. Use "Theory of credit" rather
        than "Be familiar with the theory of credit."
        5.2.6.5.3. Avoid multiple subjects or objects. Use "Theory of credit" rather than
        "Theory of debit and credit."
     5.2.6.6. Assign proficiency code levels (unless using behavioral format STS) in the
     appropriate STS column 4 subcolumns to establish resident course and CDC training
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                    47


     requirements. Do not assign codes to headings. Use OAR data, SME and training
     specialist job knowledge, MAJCOM, CDC writer, and AFCDA representative input, and
     available resource knowledge to establish requirements.
        5.2.6.6.1. When course resource constraints prevent the formal course or CDC from
        attaining the established training requirement, use dual coding to indicate the current
        training capability. Explain the dual codes in the front of the STS.
            5.2.6.6.1.1. Dual codes indicate the established requirement followed by a slash
            (/) and proficiency level that will be attained under existing constraints. Example:
            2b/X (unfunded) or 2b/a (partially funded). If a task or knowledge statement will
            not be supported by a formal course or CDC, use a dash (-) in place of a
            proficiency level.
            5.2.6.6.1.2. Unfunded training requirements written in behavioral statement
            format have "(unfunded)" immediately after the statement. When partially
            funded, include a partial training behavioral statement, enclosed in parentheses,
            immediately after the full requirement statement.
        5.2.6.6.2. Codes in the CDC columns indicate CDC-provided knowledge to support
        upgrade training. In some cases, the CDC cannot provide all career knowledge
        required for upgrade. See paragraph 13.1.5 for criteria to establish a CDC
        requirement. SKT development support is not justification to establish a CDC
        requirement.
            5.2.6.6.2.1. CDCs provide career knowledge only. Specialized knowledge, such
            as detailed technical order (TO) procedures, peculiar equipment, or weapons
            systems, is learned through work experience and OJT.
            5.2.6.6.2.2. Do not code an item in the CDC column unless there is an upgrade
            requirement, or need for review material to support an upgrade requirement. List
            task knowledge proficiency codes for task statements and subject knowledge
            codes for knowledge statements.
            5.2.6.6.2.3. Individual task or knowledge codes will be realistic and attainable
            through distance learning education. C-level training is difficult to attain through
            a paper-based CDC, and may require IMI supplements to achieve the desired
            results. Funding may be an issue and should be considered before assigning a C-
            level or higher for CDC requirements. Note: When preparing CDC manuscripts
            for submission to the AFCDA , the CDC writer identifies proficiency codes
            according to established procedures outlined in the AFCDA Course Development
            Management Guide: Standards for Course Development, Unit 3. The guide can
            be found on the AFCDA SharePoint web-site under the Bookshelf link.
     5.2.6.7. Develop STS in accordance with AFI 36-2201.
     5.2.6.8. List training references (TR).
        5.2.6.8.1. When a TR applies to all subparagraphs, list it under the major paragraph.
        There should be a TR for every paragraph and subparagraph.
        5.2.6.8.2. Omit government publication dates, but use the most current reference
        available when forwarding the final STS to the AFCFM.
 48                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


          5.2.6.8.3. Limit commercial or other service publication TRs to those commonly
          used on the job. Underline such references and provide information on how to order
          them.
          5.2.6.8.4. Confirm commercial and other service publication used as TRs are
          available from the procurement source or supplying agency. AFCFM authorizes use
          of commercial and other service publications as TRs.
5.3. Course Training Standard:
   5.3.1. Requirements. A course training standard (CTS) identifies a specific course’s
   training and proficiency level. The CTS is a contract between AETC and its customers. The
   CTS is used to identify optional supplemental training requirements, and may also be used to
   identify officer CFETP mandatory and optional course requirements. Use the TTMS CTS
   template for new courses and revisions.
      5.3.1.1. The 982 TRG may use a combined CTS and CC for Type 4 system
      courses/specialty training only.
      5.3.1.2. The 17 TRG, DoD Fire Academy CTS format will be congruent with National
      Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards. CTS items will be major line items from
      the appropriate NFPA standards.
      5.3.1.3. 17 TRG cryptologic courses may use a combination training standard matrix to
      reflect multiple user training requirements. Procedures for developing this matrix will be
      outlined in a supplement to this policy.
      5.3.1.4. Other format variations are permitted with OPR prior approval.
   5.3.2. Format. Use the TTMS CTS template. If TTMS is not available, develop a
   qualitative requirements list according to examples in Attachment 7 and Attachment 8.
   Attachment 7 is a proficiency code CTS sample. Attachment 8 is a behavioral CTS sample.
   Begin numbering on the second page and number pages consecutively. Note: 982 TRG will
   follow local procedures for developing and revising the combined CC/CTS.
   5.3.3. Cover Page:
      5.3.3.1. Format heading as shown in Attachment 7 and Attachment 8. All CTS headings
      are flush left. The CTS number is the course number, and it is flush right. Type the PDS
      code in parentheses on the line below the CTS number. Enter the CTS publication date
      (unabbreviated month and year) on the line below the PDS code.
      5.3.3.2. Center the exact course title, all upper case, two spaces below the heading.
      5.3.3.3. See Attachment 7 and Attachment 8 for appropriate cover page information and
      placement of the TRG commander‘s signature element. Do not number the cover page.
      Note: For common training courses, identify all “feeder” courses.
   5.3.3.4. Customer Service Information Line (CSIL). Include the appropriate training
   evaluation branch DSN on the first page. The training evaluation branch e-mail address may
   also be included.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                       49


  5.3.4. Qualitative Requirements Instructions:
     5.3.4.1. Generally, the proficiency code key is the second page of the document. A CTS
     in the behavioral format will not include a proficiency code key, instead use the
     behavioral statement coding system in AFI 36-2201.
     5.3.4.2. Prepare CTS to describe course content.
        5.3.4.2.1. Base tasks and knowledge statements on an analysis of available source
        data, such as applicable AFS description analysis, available OAR data, SME specialty
        knowledge, and/or MAJCOM requirements.
        5.3.4.2.2. Tasks, knowledge items, and proficiency levels will prescribe only training
        available in the course.
        5.3.4.2.3. Course content will not duplicate PME or ancillary training tasks and
        knowledge (except BMT).
        5.3.4.2.4. Do not duplicate the level of training provided in other training courses.
        5.3.4.2.5. Coordinate CTS changes that affect training through HQ AETC/A3T TPM
        for AFCFM or equivalent approval.
        5.3.4.2.6. Document CTS changes that affect training by republishing the CTS and
        generating an ATP/CTP if appropriate.
        5.3.4.2.7. Write-in changes that do not alter course content or impact resources may
        be made to CTS. TRGs will submit a memorandum signed by the TM through the
        TRG to HQ AETC/A3T and HQ AETC/A1MRT, stating the reason for the change.
        Include a copy of the coordination with local manpower, logistics, and maintenance
        organizations verifying the proposed changes do not impact resources (see paragraph
        4.3.3.) and the corrected CTS as attachments to the memorandum.
        5.3.4.2.8. TM will document editorial changes that do not alter course content in the
        record set and the TTMS database, as applicable.
     5.3.4.3. Describe task and knowledge training requirements in the same manner as in
     paragraphs 5.2.6.4. through 5.2.6.6.1.2. to develop CTS elements.
     5.3.4.4. Use proficiency code key scale values (unless using behavioral statements), to
     specify the capabilities graduates will have after training. When lack of resources affects
     training, dual-code to show established training requirements versus present training
     capability. When dual-coding, explain the codes on the cover page. Training references
     may be used when advantageous.
     5.3.4.5. The following guidelines apply to behavioral statement CTSs:
        5.3.4.5.1. Describe observable, measurable skills and knowledge gained from
        training. Clearly state what graduates will be able to do. If necessary, include
        conditions and/or standards to clarify the behavior.
        5.3.4.5.2. Each statement should establish a training requirement using verbs that
        describe observable and measurable student behavior. Limit verbs to one action per
        statement unless actions are closely related, such as “remove and replace.” Avoid
50                                                         AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


        vague, ambiguous words such as "know" or "understand," and meaningless qualifiers
        such as "when appropriate" or "as necessary."
     5.3.4.6. Include a summary of changes at the end of each CTS Attachment 1.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                       51


                                            Chapter 6

                                  TRAINING OBJECTIVES

6.1. Description. An objective is a precise statement of the learned behavior (skills, knowledge,
or attitudes) a student is expected to demonstrate, the condition under which the behavior is to be
exhibited, and the standard of acceptable performance upon completion of training.
Performance-based objectives are preferred for teaching skills in technical training courses. The
behavior and conditions found in performance objectives duplicate or simulate as close as
possible those found in the job environment. Knowledge-based objectives may be used to train
theory and subject knowledge. Affective objectives may be used to develop student attitudes in a
desired direction.
   6.1.1. Objectives are normally developed to measure individual behavior, i.e. “Each student
   will…” Objectives may be developed using a team concept when the task cannot be
   performed by a single individual. When using team objectives, ensure students rotate so each
   student performs all parts of the task. For example, a student cannot pass the objective by
   just reading the technical order procedures while another student performs the task.
   6.1.2. Training objectives consist of three parts: a condition, a behavior, and a standard.
   Objectives may use implied conditions and standards.
       6.1.2.1. The condition identifies the situation under which a student is expected to
       demonstrate a behavior. A properly prepared objective clearly states the limits or
       conditions of student performance. Conditions under which the training is performed
       should be the same as the actual job conditions, if possible. Condition statements can be
       derived from the task analysis.
       6.1.2.2. The behavior is defined as a skill, knowledge, or attitude that is observable and
       measurable. The behavior must be written in measurable, observable terms so student
       performance can be objectively evaluated. Use observable and measurable action verbs
       to reduce ambiguity. Behaviors must satisfy training standard job knowledge and
       performance requirements.
       6.1.2.3. The standard defines the criteria for acceptable performance by the student. It
       is stated in terms such as completeness, accuracy requirements, time constraints,
       performance rates, and qualitative requirements. The standard identifies the proficiency
       students must achieve when performing the behavior under the specified conditions.
       Standards of performance are often specified in standard publications such as technical
       orders, instructions, manuals and handbooks. However, if no standards are available, set
       standards based on other sources such as experience or similar tasks.
6.2. Objective hierarchy. Objective hierarchy identifies the relationship between objectives
such as which objectives are prerequisite to another objective. For example, learning how to use
tools and jacks would be prerequisite to changing a tire. The sequence and lessons within a
course should be based on the prerequisite relationship among the objectives. The most obvious
sequence follows the order from simple to complex or from general to specific.
 52                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


6.3. For additional guidance on objectives , see AFH 36-2235, Volume 9, Information for
Designers of Instructional Systems, Application to Technical Training; AFMAN 36-2234,
Instructional System Development; and AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors.
6.4. Developing Objectives
   6.4.1. Use TTMS ICIS to build unclassified course objectives.
   6.4.2. Cover each training standard item with one or more objectives.            Collectively,
   objectives will satisfy all training standard requirements.
   6.4.3. Base objectives on training standard task and knowledge statements. Reference each
   objective to the training standard item(s) it supports. Due to the inherent difficulty of
   measuring multiple tasks or subjects within one objective, use discretion when referencing
   multiple training standard items to a single objective.
   6.4.4. Define conditions that match job conditions as closely as possible. Ensure the
   conditions are realistic. Identify what the student may use to achieve the required behavior.
   Objectives written without conditions imply “without reference” or “from memory.”
   6.4.5. Identify the behavior for performance-based objectives using the training standard
   task statement to ensure the objective reflects on-the-job behaviors. Limit action verbs to
   one per objective unless actions are normally concurrent (such as “remove and reinstall”).
      6.4.5.1. For knowledge-based objectives, identify behaviors using action verbs that are
      observable and measurable. Don't use behaviors such as "know," "understand," etc.
      6.4.5.2. Do not use the measurement device as the object of an action verb.
      6.4.5.3. When a behavioral statement CTS is the training standard, objective behaviors
      will mirror the CTS behaviors.
      6.4.5.4. If course objectives are written in the affective domain, use relative verbs to
      describe the intended behavior or change in attitude. Affective verbs do not describe
      observable, measurable actions for behavioral objectives. Affective verbs describe a
      level of commitment to an attitude, value, or belief. Affective behaviors can only be
      measured by observing changes in behavior over time. Some affective verbs are: accept,
      recognize, feel, sense, capture, experience, attend, perceive, allow, display, clarify,
      internalize, etc.
   6.4.6. Standards define the proficiency level students must attain to pass the objective. Use a
   standard that meets job performance requirements, if possible.
      6.4.6.1. Standards must be clear, realistic, understood by everyone, and must accurately
      measure student achievement of the objective. If the objective finalizes a training
      standard element, the standard ensures students have met the required proficiency.
      6.4.6.2. The objective standard may be implied. For example, "identify traffic signs" has
      an implied standard of 100%.
      6.4.6.3. Performance objective standards may indicate a specific time, degree of
      accuracy, required quality, or reference “in accordance with” a specified TO, instruction,
      manual, handbook, or checklist. Performance objectives written without a defined
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                   53


     standard imply performance must be without error or assistance and with 100 percent
     accuracy (go/no-go).
     6.4.6.4. Knowledge objectives may imply standards where sampling written tests are
     used to measure the objective. If a progress check is used to measure knowledge
     objectives, the objective standard will reflect the standard required to successfully pass
     the progress check and the objective must be closed out with the progress check. If a
     sampling written test is the only measurement to be used, the implied standard will be the
     minimum passing score established for the test.
 54                                                           AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


                                         Chapter 7

                               STUDENT MEASUREMENT

7.1. General. Student measurement consists of both informal and formal measurement devices
designed to assess the student’s attainment of the objective.
   7.1.1. Formal measurement/assessment is required in all courses to assess task knowledge,
   subject knowledge, and task performance objectives. Formal measurement/assessment
   includes progress checks, performance tests, and written tests.
      7.1.1.1. If progress checks are used to measure all objectives, a written test is not
      required. Tests should only be used if there is a valid need for additional measurement
      beyond the progress check. Use performance tests to measure performance objectives
      where progress checks do not provide an adequate degree of quality control or record of
      performance.
      7.1.1.2. When measuring learning in the affective domain, alternative
      measurement/assessment may be developed. These include, but are not limited to, team
      building activities, case studies, simulations, open-ended question assessments, and
      observation/assessment over time.
      7.1.1.3. Informal measurement is not required but may be used to assess day-to-day
      learning and serve as an early indicator of students who need individual assistance.
      Informal measurement consists of appraisals, quizzes, and other similar devices. There is
      no requirement to record results of informal measurement.
   7.1.2. Each student must successfully pass all formal measurement devices to graduate. An
   exception would be a measurement not taken because of a documented training deficiency.
   Instructors may grant international students additional time to complete measurement devices
   when language difficulties dictate.
   7.1.3. Measurement devices will measure the behavior of training objectives.
      7.1.3.1. Measure both task knowledge and task performance portions of performance
      objectives. Develop a separate measurement for the task knowledge portion of
      performance objectives when task knowledge measurement is not readily apparent in the
      successful achievement of a performance test or performance progress check.
      7.1.3.2. Subject-matter qualified instructors must certify that students achieve the
      objectives tested.
   7.1.4. Write measurement items using the guidelines in AFH 36-2235, Volume 12,
   Information for Designers of Instructional Systems - Test and Measurement Handbook,
   AFMAN 36-2234; and AFMAN 36-2236.
   7.1.5. Computer-based measurement and analysis is encouraged. If computer-based
   measurement is used, units must use the TTMS Automated Testing function and alternate
   methodologies should be available. Exception: DoD Fire Academy at Goodfellow AFB TX
   is authorized to use the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) directed CerTest Testing
   Platform. Information assurance training at Keesler AFB MS is authorized to use DoD
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                     55


   approved certification tests listed in DoD 8570.01-M, Information Assurance Workforce
   Improvement Program.
   7.1.6. Ensure measurement devices include a foreign disclosure disclaimer if foreign
   military/international students are to be trained. Examples: (1) “This document contains
   information which may not be disclosed to international students without proper
   authorization. Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum in the security annex of the
   Course Training Plan for further information.” (2) “Foreign Disclosure: The information in
   this document is not restricted and may be disclosed to international students. Refer to the
   foreign disclosure memorandum in the security annex of the Course Training Plan for further
   information.”
7.2. Minimum Passing Requirements:
   7.2.1. Minimum passing score for performance progress checks and performance tests will
   be the same as the objective standard. Identify the minimum passing score in the
   standardized instructions given to students.
   7.2.2. Grade performance progress checks and performance tests as satisfactory (S),
   unsatisfactory (U), or using a percentage score. Percentage scores will be 70 percent or
   higher.
   7.2.3. Minimum passing score for the knowledge portion of performance progress checks,
   knowledge progress checks, and written tests will be 70 percent or higher.
   7.2.4. The minimum passing score may be expressed as either a percentage or a ratio of
   whole numbers.
      7.2.4.1. If a ratio is used, it must meet or exceed 70 percent without rounding. For
      example, 15 of 21 correct is 71.428 percent, exceeding 70 percent. The grade posted in
      the student record will be rounded to the nearest whole number. Decimals of .5 and
      greater are rounded up. In the example above, a score of 71 percent would be posted in
      the student record.
      7.2.4.2. If a student fails a written measurement, retests and passes, the student receives
      the minimum passing score for the measurement. However, all scores should be
      documented because they might provide additional insight into student motivation or
      ability to study and learn.
7.3. Progress Checks:
   7.3.1. Progress checks are formal measurement devices administered by the instructor during
   the classroom or laboratory instruction time to assess the student's accomplishment of
   knowledge or performance objectives. These checks provide immediate feedback to the
   student and instructor.
   7.3.2. A subject-matter qualified instructor determines if the student has successfully
   accomplished the objective and bases that judgment on the behavior observed and the
   standard stated in the objective. The instructor evaluates student performance using the
   applicable checklist or TO.
   7.3.3. Ensure the progress check measures all training standard items when a single
   objective covers multiple TS items.
 56                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


   7.3.4. Develop progress checklists for each objective assessed by a progress check.
   Reference the appropriate TO when operational aircraft and equipment are used for training.
   The appropriate TO must be used during the progress check. Knowledge progress checks
   may be administered using computer-based measurement. If computer-based measurement
   is used, alternate methodologies should be available.
      7.3.4.1. Develop specific instructions for the instructor and student that detail the
      measurement process to include the meaning of an instructor assist, if used, and identify
      the minimum passing standard.
      7.3.4.2. Alternate versions of progress checks are not required.       However, alternate
      versions of knowledge progress checks are encouraged.
   7.3.5. Progress checks will be afforded the same security and control as tests when prior
   knowledge of the progress check will afford the student an advantage. Progress checks that
   cannot be compromised do not need to be controlled.
   7.3.6. Instructors may return workbooks, exercises, or other material used during progress
   checks to the students after the material has been graded and critiqued, if such material does
   not compromise the progress check.
   7.3.7. Actual accomplishment of progress checks may be delayed until the end of a unit of
   instruction (or week of training (WOT) for BMT), to allow a check of more than one
   objective at a time. Accomplishment of the performance progress checks being used for
   certification in Mission Ready Airmen (MRA) courses may be delayed to the next block of
   instruction (or WOT for BMT) to enhance student retention.
   7.3.8. Record unsatisfactory completion of objectives in TTMS student management in
   accordance with AETCI 36-2215, Technical and Basic Military Training Administration.
   7.3.9. When TTMS is unavailable, results may be maintained on AETC Form 667, Criterion
   Checklist; AETC Form 667A, Criterion Checklist; AETC Form 98, Student Progress
   Checklist; or a computer-generated checklist. Maintain results of the checklist during the
   validation phase of training to permit analysis and validation of the checklist.
7.4. Written Tests:
   7.4.1. Written tests are designed to evaluate student task and subject knowledge.
      7.4.1.1. Written tests sample each task knowledge objective, subject knowledge
      objective, and the knowledge components of task performance objectives, as appropriate.
      Many concept and rule-using type performances may be tested with written tests. For
      instance, many problem-solving skills involving the use of scientific principles can be
      observed from written tests. Written tests may be computer-based or paper-based.
      7.4.1.2. When students successfully achieve the minimum overall passing score on a
      written test, it provides an acceptable level of confidence that they have attained the
      required knowledge and achieved the individual objectives.
      7.4.1.3. Written tests may be used to aid knowledge retention and act as a quality control
      device. When progress checks are used to measure each objective, written tests should
      only be used if there is a valid need for additional measurement beyond the progress
      check.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                        57


   7.4.2. Written tests are administered as a separate unit of instruction in the course under
   controlled conditions after the teaching-learning activity has been completed.
   7.4.3. Written tests are not limited to selection type items. They may be essay or supply type,
   such as fill in the blank.
   7.4.4. The difficulty, complexity, criticality, time, and scope of behavior specified by the
   objectives are used to determine the number of test items required to cover each objective.
   Time allotted for the testing period also impacts the number of test items. Note: When a
   single objective finalizes multiple training standard items, ensure the number of questions is
   sufficient to assess student attainment of all training standard items.
   7.4.5. Use technical data when required by the objective. Use of technical data is not
   required for a written test unless it is necessarily part of the behavior being measured.
   7.4.6. Develop enough test versions (a minimum of two) for each measurement point to
   provide alternate tests in the event of a test compromise or test failure. It is not necessary to
   maintain alternate test versions if the course uses randomly generated computer tests.
      7.4.6.1. Randomly rotate test versions to ensure each is administered as equally as
      possible.
      7.4.6.2. All test versions will have the same number of test items per objective. The
      passing standard and number of test items will be the same for alternate test versions.
      7.4.6.3. Avoid duplicate test items if possible. If circumstances limit the variety of test
      items supporting an objective, reword items, resequence answers, or scramble items on
      the alternate version to deter test compromise.
      7.4.6.4. Develop standardized instructions for the examiner and examinee.
      7.4.6.5. Written tests do not have to be dated after the POI. Simply annotate the master
      copy of the test to indicate the POI it supports.
   7.4.7. Maintain a master copy of each test, either electronic or paper-based, to identify the
   correct answers, show POI objective correlation to each test item, and identify the approved
   corrections and changes made in the test. Note: Reasons for change are documented on
   AETC Form 668, Test Data; or a test change document while actual changes are annotated
   on the test master copy.
   7.4.8. For ease of scoring paper-based tests, course personnel may use AETC Form 26,
   Standard Answer Sheet (50 Items) and AETC Form 26A, Standard Answer Sheet (100
   Items); or other suitable answer sheets.
   7.4.9. Record student grades in TTMS Student Management or on the AETC Form 156,
   Student Training Report; or AETC Form 325, Student Accounting and Attendance Record, in
   accordance with AETCI 36-2215.
7.5. Performance Tests:
   7.5.1. Performance tests are designed to evaluate student hands-on skills required by
   performance objectives. Performance tests should only be used if there is a valid need for
   additional measurement beyond the progress check or progress checks do not provide an
   adequate degree of quality control or record of performance.
 58                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


   7.5.2. A performance test is administered as a separate unit of instruction under controlled
   conditions after the teaching-learning activity has been completed. Performance tests often
   require actual equipment or an operational mock-up of the equipment. Computer-based
   simulations or other virtual training methods may be used for performance testing, as
   appropriate.
   7.5.3. Use technical data when specified as a condition in the objective.
   7.5.4. Develop standardized instructions for the examiner and examinee to use in
   administering and critiquing the performance test. Include the performance test requirements
   and minimum student grade requirements on the AETC Form 98, Student Progress Checklist
   or a locally approved checklist.
   7.5.5. Individually inform each student of his or her grade and critique the student's
   performance as soon as practical after test administration. Record grades in TTMS or on
   AETC Form 156, or AETC Form 325, if TTMS is not available.
   7.5.6. Task certification (when required by the career field) in formal courses may be
   performed by the instructor when students attain performance standards defined in AFI 36-
   2201. Training records will be documented according to AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6.
      7.5.6.1. Only subject-matter qualified instructors may initial CFETPs or electronic
      equivalent, and will include “AETC Instructor” after their names in the identification
      block of the students’ CFETP Part II or equivalent.
      7.5.6.2. Upon course completion, the CFETP or electronic equivalent is provided to the
      student's gaining organization. This may be accomplished by mail, be hand-carried by
      the student, or sent electronically. Note: Not applicable to firefighting training.
   7.5.7. Administer a performance recheck only when a special requirement has been
   identified in the training standard or when separate agency certification is required (such as
   typing or coding speed).
7.6. Group Measurement:
   7.6.1. Ensure objectives that require group, team, or flight performance specify in the
   conditions that a group, team, or flight performs the behavior.
   7.6.2. Rate each group or team member's performance and participation. Rotate each
   member of a group or team to different positions during the performance test or progress
   check to ensure they perform and are assessed on all parts of the task.
   7.6.3. Evaluate students while they are actively performing the tasks associated with the
   objective. Do not assume success merely by observing the student reading a procedural
   document.
   7.6.4. Inform each trainee of his or her grade and critique trainee performance as soon as
   practical after measurement administration.
7.7. Written Measurement Feedback:
   7.7.1. Individually inform students of their grades as soon as practical after administering a
   written test. In BMT, trainees receive their scores after the test feedback.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                     59


   7.7.2. Temporarily return scored answer sheets and copies of the test to students for their
   review during the feedback process (except video-teletraining, computer-based instruction,
   and computer-based testing). In BMT, the feedback will be accomplished using the test
   booklets only.
   7.7.3. Review all test questions. Make students aware of the answers to missed questions
   and clarify misunderstandings to enhance learning. Obtain students' opinions if questions
   were clear and understandable and why questions were missed so corrective actions may be
   taken, if appropriate.
   7.7.4. For Type 6 courses requiring measurement, feedback is managed by the designated
   test site monitor. The test site monitor may refer students to the appropriate TRS for
   additional feedback.
7.8. Written Test Analysis:
   7.8.1. The goal of written test analysis is to determine if each test item effectively and
   objectively measures the degree of student achievement required in the specific learning
   objective. Each test item must meet the necessary standards of difficulty, reliability, and
   validity.
   7.8.2. After each test administration, record test results on AETC Form 668, or in a
   computer-generated test analysis system. Examiners make appropriate comments on AETC
   Form 668 or other applicable data collection documents, to include computer forms of
   documentation. Alternate test analysis methods may be used for randomly generated
   computer tests.
   7.8.3. Conduct a high-miss test question analysis, at a minimum, after each test
   administration. Normally, a test item is considered high-miss when 50 percent or more of the
   students in a given test administration miss the item. Identify high miss trends and problem
   questions, and revise questions or instructions as necessary. Document the review and
   actions taken.
   7.8.4. If high-miss or poorly performing items based on test analysis become evident after a
   written test has been validated, review the training activities associated with these items to
   determine the cause.
   7.8.5. Conduct a comprehensive statistical item analysis of the test results for each course
   written test at least annually. Base the frequency of the review cycle on student flow.
   Analyze the high-miss items/areas of difficulty to determine if any corrective action is
   required. Refer to AFMAN 36-2236 for more information on analysis methods, application,
   and interpretation. Annual test reviews may be conducted concurrently with the periodic
   course review. Document the review and actions taken.
7.9. Measurement Plan:
   7.9.1. A course measurement plan ensures adequate assessment of all course objectives. Use
   the TTMS ICIS measurement plan template to develop measurement plans. For Type 4
   courses, the POI meets the requirements for the measurement plan.
   7.9.2. The measurement plan includes the following information:
 60                                                              AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


      7.9.2.1. POI objectives correlated to training standard items and associated proficiency
      codes.
      7.9.2.2. Type of measurement (PC - progress check, W - written test, and P -
      performance test) for each objective.
      7.9.2.3. Written test question numbers correlated to objectives.
      7.9.2.4. Point at which training standard element is closed out.
      7.9.2.5. Maintain measurement plan in TTMS ICIS.
7.10. Measurement Safeguards/Security
   7.10.1. Employ appropriate safeguards including those applicable to computer systems to
   prevent compromise of measurement materials.
   7.10.2. Administer all measurement, including computer-based or online measurement, in a
   controlled, proctored environment.
   7.10.3. At a minimum, configure computer-based and online measurement systems to:
      7.10.3.1. Block predator computer programs from running during formal online
      measurement.
      7.10.3.2. Prevent the use of shortcut keystrokes to accomplish bypassing measurement
      security.
      7.10.3.3. Prevent viewing of the hypertext markup language (html) coding associated
      with web pages.
      7.10.3.4. Ensure additional software programs, such as Web X, are not running in the
      background during online measurement.
      7.10.3.5. Assign proper security profiles and roles for all levels of users.
      7.10.3.6. Limit administrative privileges on servers.
      7.10.3.7. Support secure deployment of testing software with separate web servers,
      application servers, and database servers.
      7.10.3.8. Prevent measurement materials tests from being improperly posted to shared
      drives.
      7.10.3.9. Ensure identification and authorization of all users.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                    61


                                          Chapter 8

                                     COURSE CHARTS

8.1. General. The course chart provides an executive summary of training, outlining the
general structure and content of a course. It also provides course parameters and other course
data to be used for course planning and control. Use the TTMS ICIS course chart template or, if
TTMS is not available, AETC Form 449, Course Chart. The 982 TRG may use a combined
course chart and course training standard for Type 4 courses.
   8.1.1. An approved course chart is required for Types 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, C, A, W, and M
   courses. Type 1 should be handled case-by-case. Refer to Attachment 9 for an example
   AETC Form 449, Course Chart.
8.2. Training Day
   8.2.1. The standard training day includes 8 hours of academic instruction divided into eight
   50-minute periods with 10 minutes of break time and 1 hour for mealtime (400 minutes of
   instruction). It is acceptable to continue training beyond 50 minutes and accumulate break
   time if doing so enhances the learning activity. Use the standard training day when
   developing all technical training courses, except BMT and Type 6 DL.
   8.2.2. The compressed work schedule (CWS) standard training day is an 8-hour training day
   that includes 445 minutes of instruction with 35 minutes of break time and 1 hour for
   mealtime. A total of 4,000 minutes of instruction must be provided during a 9-day training
   period.
   8.2.3. The standard training day may include at least 6 hours of classroom/lab time and up to
   2 hours of supervised or directed study.
       8.2.3.1. Supervised study is time dedicated to student achievement of course objectives
       using self-study instructional materials. Specific objectives must be assigned and
       measured. Material covered by supervised study must not be retaught. A subject-matter
       qualified instructor must be present and may monitor more than one group of students.
       8.2.3.2. Directed study is time dedicated to student achievement of course objectives
       using self-study instructional materials. Specific objectives must be assigned and
       measured. Material covered by directed study must not be retaught. An instructor is not
       required to provide direct supervision to students for this period. No instructor
       authorizations are earned for directed study hours.
       8.2.3.3. Do not confuse directed study or supervised study with special individualized
       assistance (SIA). See AETCI 36-2215 for SIA guidance.
   8.2.4. TRG commanders may approve modifications to the standard training day necessary
   to train unique course objectives on a case-by-case basis. Examples include multiple shift
   operations, travel time to and from training areas, performance objectives that cannot be
   completed within the standard training day, capstone performance exercises, and field
   exercises.
       8.2.4.1. TRG commanders may approve modifications to accommodate field trips. Field
       trips will not exceed 5 days total per course.
 62                                                               AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


       8.2.4.2. Modified training days must include at least 8 hours of academic instruction.
       Exception: For three-shift operations, second and third shift may include no less than 7
       hours of academic instruction and no less than 30 minutes for mealtime.
       8.2.4.3. Document rationale for modification and approval in the Remarks section of
       AETC Form 449.
   8.2.5. Day-to-day deviations for events such as appointments, functions, or unforeseen
   course interruptions are approved by the training squadron, detachment, or operating location
   commander or chief. A few examples of situations that may require a deviation are severe
   weather, illness, and equipment and/or aircraft malfunction. Keep deviations to the training
   day minimized. Training time lost due to these deviations must be made up or training
   deficiencies issued. Except for weather or unexpected emergencies, do not extend the course
   length or change the class graduation date.
   8.2.6. Courses involving TDY instructors or where the majority of students are in a TDY
   status will be accomplished on a standard training day.
8.3. Training Shifts
   8.3.1. Refer to Table 8.1 to identify training shift codes and shift times.

Table 8.1. Shift Time Identification Codes.
 I         A                                               B

 8        E       Nonstandard training day: 24-hour day or other variation as required
8.4. Standard Training Parameters
   8.4.1. Course charts will reflect the following standard training parameters:
       8.4.1.1. Course Orientation. Should not exceed 2 hours per course.
          8.4.1.1.1. Type 6 courses usually require less time. Note: Type 6 courses
          orientation will include information in paragraphs 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2, 9.2.5.4, and any
          others as applicable.
          8.4.1.1.2. In BMT, the immediate incoming briefing serves as the course orientation
          and introduction. The standard topics for a course orientation are woven throughout a
          series of briefings in the BMT curriculum.
       8.4.1.2. Course Feedback and Graduation. Should not exceed 1.5 hours per course.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                        63


          8.4.1.2.1. Course feedback surveys are administered shortly before departure in
          BMT. In BMT, the graduation parade serves as the course graduation.
          8.4.1.2.2. Type 6 courses may require significantly less time because there is no
          graduation ceremony upon course completion.
      8.4.1.3. Written Measurement and Feedback (Optional). Should not exceed 1.5
      hours per test.
          8.4.1.3.1. If extra time is needed due to the amount and complexity of the testable
          material, do not exceed 2.5 hours per test.
          8.4.1.3.2. Document rationale for additional testing time in the Remarks section of
          the AETC Form 449.
          8.4.1.3.3. Typically, a written test should cover a minimum of 32-40 course hours.
          However, they may be as infrequent as 80-120 course hours or greater. In any case,
          test frequency and content coverage must be consistent with sound educational
          practice. Note: Time allotted for progress checks is included in the objective times
          and will not be listed as a separate unit in the course chart.
      8.4.1.4. Outprocessing Appointments (as required). Should not exceed 2 hours per
      course. If extra time is needed, document rationale for additional time in the Remarks
      section of the AETC Form 449. In BMT, picking up orders serves as the trainee's
      outprocessing appointment. Note: This time does not earn manpower resources.
      8.4.1.5. Traffic Safety Education. Should not exceed 2 hours per course, when
      required by the TRW or TRG. Note: This time does not earn manpower resources.
   8.4.2. Commander's call or graduate evaluation information will not be included as course
   chart time.
   8.4.3. The last training day must be at least 5 hours in length (except in Type 6 and self-
   paced courses) when the course is over 20 academic days in length.
8.5. Developing Course Charts:
   8.5.1. General
      8.5.1.1. When using TTMS ICIS, the information on the course chart is populated from
      data fields input during the ISD process. If TTMS ICIS is not available, the information
      is entered on the AETC Form 449.
      8.5.1.2. Show supervised and directed study hours separately from C/L hours on the
      TTMS course chart template or AETC Form 449.
      8.5.1.3. Do not include PME or ancillary training as part of course time unless a waiver
      has been granted by HQ USAF/AIDL.
      8.5.1.4. Include the following information in the Remarks section of the TTMS ICIS
      course chart template or the AETC Form 449:
      8.5.1.5. Effective date with class number.
      8.5.1.6. List of other course charts that apply during a phase-out or validation period.
64                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


     8.5.1.7. When applicable, document rationale for modification to the standard training
     day and approval by the TRG commander.
     8.5.1.8. When applicable, document rationale for additional testing and/or outprocessing
     appointment time.
     8.5.1.9. The name, office symbol, and phone number of the TM responsible for the
     accuracy of the information on the course chart.
     8.5.1.10. When applicable, document approval to use motivational training included in
     the remarks section. Note: Adding motivational training to or removing motivational
     training from a course will require a new course chart and an ATP.
     8.5.1.11. All piggyback courses.
     8.5.1.12. For common training courses, show all “feeder” courses.
     8.5.1.13. Foreign disclosure disclaimer if foreign military/international students are to be
     trained. Examples: (1) “This course contains information which may not be disclosed to
     international students without proper authorization. Refer to the foreign disclosure
     memorandum in the security annex of the Course Training Plan for further information.”
     (2) “Foreign Disclosure: The information in this course is not restricted and may be
     disclosed to international students. Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum in the
     security annex of the Course Training Plan for further information.”
     8.5.1.14. Contingency delivery plan for interactive video teletraining (IVT) courses or
     web-based courses. Identify alternative delivery methods in the event of satellite or
     equipment/network failure.
  8.5.2. Table 1 – Major Items of Equipment. Enter “Refer to TTMS equipment list.” or
  “Refer to AETC Form 120.”, as appropriate.
  8.5.3. Table 2 – Training Content. Table 2 identifies the course content by block. Each
  block entry identifies the block title, total technical training hours, individual lesson/unit
  titles and hours, non-technical training hours, and total block and course hours. Prepare
  Table 2 on the back of AETC Form 449 or on plain bond paper if TTMS is not available.
  See Attachment 9 for an example.
  8.5.4. Mark classified course charts, classified block and unit titles, and individual segments
  and paragraphs with the appropriate security classification in accordance with DoDM
  5200.01, DoD Information Security Program: Marking Classified Information, and local
  special security office procedures. When titles of classified units of instruction are
  unclassified, add a statement in the remarks section or in Table 2 indicating the titles are
  unclassified and are marked only to reflect classification of course content.
  8.5.5. Write-in changes that do not alter course content or impact resources may be made to
  course charts. TRGs will submit a memorandum signed by the TM through the TRG to HQ
  AETC/A3T and HQ AETC/A1MRT, stating the reason for the change. Include a copy of the
  coordination with local manpower, logistics, and maintenance organizations verifying the
  proposed changes do not impact resources (see paragraph 4.3.) and the corrected course chart
  as attachments to the memorandum.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                           65


8.6. Wartime Courses. Wartime courses will be developed as separate builds with wartime
course numbers in TTMS ICIS on an as-needed basis when there are different tasks and/or
equipment to be trained during wartime.
 66                                                              AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


                                           Chapter 9

              PLANS OF INSTRUCTION (POI) AND LESSON PLANS (LP)

9.1. POI Purpose. The POI is a course control document, organized by blocks and units in the
preferred sequence of instruction. It lists the course objectives, necessary support materials and
guidance, and training time allotted for each block, unit, and objective. Actual instruction times
may vary due to class size or different student ability. When separated into units of instruction,
the POI becomes Part I of the lesson plan.
9.2. POI Development:
   9.2.1. Prepare a POI for all formal courses developed and administered by AETC. When
   using TTMS ICIS, the information on the POI is populated from data fields input during the
   ISD process. If TTMS ICIS is not available, the information is entered on the AETC Form
   133, Plan of Instruction/Lesson Plan - Part I.
   9.2.2. Ensure the POI front cover includes a foreign disclosure disclaimer if foreign
   military/international students are to be trained. Examples: (1) “This course contains
   information which may not be disclosed to international students without proper
   authorization. Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum in the security annex of the
   Course Training Plan for further information.” (2) “Foreign Disclosure: The information in
   this course is not restricted and may be disclosed to international students. Refer to the
   foreign disclosure memorandum in the security annex of the Course Training Plan for further
   information.”
   9.2.3. Include one or more objectives in each instructional unit/lesson or module.
   Supporting teaching steps are optional.
       9.2.3.1. Reference each objective to the training standard element(s) supported.
       Underline the element at the point where students attain the specified training standard
       proficiency level/behavior.
       9.2.3.2. An objective using previously taught skills or knowledge will not refer to that
       training standard element unless accomplishing the objective results in a planned
       proficiency increase.
       9.2.3.3. Do not underline (finalize) a training standard element more than once, or use an
       underlined reference again in the planned sequence of instruction. Note: This does not
       prohibit future lesson use of knowledge and skills learned and measured in previous
       units, blocks or WOT.
       9.2.3.4. Document the POI to training standard correlation in the measurement plan to
       show which objectives support and satisfy each training standard element.
   9.2.4. Indicate the type of student measurement for each objective: PC - progress check; P -
   performance test; W - written test.
   9.2.5. Identify support materials and guidance for each instruction unit or module. Support
   materials and guidance includes student instructional materials, audiovisual aids, training
   equipment, training methods, MIR, and instructional guidance.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                      67


     9.2.5.1. Student Instructional Materials. List all instructional materials necessary to
     support the objectives, such as study guides, workbooks, handouts, standard publications,
     commercial publications, and technical orders.
     9.2.5.2. Audiovisual Aids. List all audiovisual aids necessary to support the objectives,
     such as computer-based multimedia presentations, video, movies, vignettes, graphics, and
     slides.
     9.2.5.3. Training Equipment. List all equipment necessary to train the objective.
     9.2.5.4. Training Methods. Identify the training method, such as lecture,
     lecture/discussion, demonstration, performance, directed study, or supervised study, used
     to present each objective and the time allotted to each method.
     9.2.5.5. Multiple Instructor Requirement (MIR). Identify the number and utilization
     of multiple instructors required to meet the objective(s). Example: Safety/Supervision
     (3).
        9.2.5.5.1. Only qualified personnel will be used as primary instructors or to certify
        student achievement of course objectives. An individual who has not completed an
        instructor training course or is not qualified in the specific block of instruction may be
        used to satisfy a safety MIR. Do not use students to fulfill the MIR. Exception: For
        982 TRG Type 3 and Type 4 courses, task certified personnel may be used to support
        safety MIR or as team members to support team training objectives.
        9.2.5.5.2. If MIR cannot be met, the training flight/detachment commander or chief
        may waive the POI MIR requirement on a class-by-class basis. Note: Training
        flight/detachment commanders/chiefs must ensure all assigned instructors are being
        utilized in their primary duty prior to granting a waiver. Resequence objectives,
        where practical, to avoid MIR waiver. MIR for safety cannot be waived.
        9.2.5.5.3. If MIR is waived, additional training time necessary to meet the training
        objective must be documented.
        9.2.5.5.4. If MIR for safety cannot be met or additional training time is not practical,
        conduct training to the highest proficiency practical and document a training
        deficiency. For example, if equipment is not available to train an objective to the
        “2b” task performance proficiency, train to the “b” proficiency and document a
        training deficiency.
        9.2.5.5.5. Document the waiver on a memorandum, identifying the class and
        objectives impacted, the rationale for the waiver, and the action taken to satisfy the
        objective or document a training deficiency. Include justification for the action taken
        or training deficiency. Forward an information copy of the waiver memorandum
        through the training manager to the squadron commander, the group commander, 2
        AF, and HQ AETC/A3T.
        9.2.5.5.6. Maintain MIR waiver memorandums for 3 years.
     9.2.5.6. Instructional Guidance. Instructional guidance:
        9.2.5.6.1. Conveys the course designer’s intent on how to conduct the teaching-
        learning activity in each objective to the instructor. Guidance should contain enough
68                                                            AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


        support information to enable new instructors to present each objective effectively
        and efficiently.
        9.2.5.6.2. Explains the MIR, how the MIR will be used, the instructor-to-student ratio
        when using the MIR, and objective hours requiring the MIR.
        9.2.5.6.3. Describes how and where to integrate job-oriented safety, environmental
        issues, and publications awareness, as appropriate.
        9.2.5.6.4. Requires instructors to weave in risk management principles, energy
        conservation, core values, and Air Force doctrine throughout each lesson, as
        appropriate.
        9.2.5.6.5. Describes how and when motivational training may be applied within each
        unit of instruction and how motivational training ties to specific objectives, if
        applicable. Lists approved methods, limitations and desired results.
        9.2.5.6.6. Describes purpose, content, how, and when field trips will be conducted, if
        applicable. If the field trip cannot be accomplished, identify how objectives will be
        met and measured.
        9.2.5.6.7. Includes foreign disclosure disclaimer for each lesson, where appropriate.
        The foreign disclosure disclaimer calls the instructor’s attention to lessons containing
        information that cannot be released without proper authorization. Example: “This
        lesson contains information which may not be disclosed to international students
        without proper authorization. Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum in the
        security annex of the Course Training Plan for further information.”
  9.2.6. Course Orientation. Include a nonmeasured orientation that covers at least the
  following:
     9.2.6.1. Course overview and administration.
     9.2.6.2. Student feedback program.
     9.2.6.3. Effective study techniques (airman basic resident and enlisted prerequisite
     resident courses only).
     9.2.6.4. CCAF benefits and credits, if applicable (enlisted courses and officer courses
     attended by enlisted members).
     9.2.6.5. Instructional material types and uses.
     9.2.6.6. Training material and resource conservation.
     9.2.6.7. Training environment safety (including chemical and/or radiation hazards, when
     appropriate).
     9.2.6.8. Air Force fraud, waste, and abuse prevention and detection.
     9.2.6.9. Sexual harassment and assault reporting, professional and unprofessional
     relationships, trainee abuse and hazing, and academic integrity.
        9.2.6.9.1. Ensure the instructional guidance includes the following guidance for this
        teaching step: Describe required standards of conduct for trainees/students, faculty,
        and staff. Ensure AETCI 36-2909, Recruiting, Education, and Training Standards of
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                    69


         Conduct, is included as part of the student instructional material. Refer to AETCI 36-
         2909 for examples of professional and unprofessional relationships between
         trainees/students, faculty, and staff. Encourage trainees/students to follow the chain
         of command to resolve issues, where practical. If the unprofessional conduct
         involves someone in the trainee/student’s chain of command, inform trainees/students
         they may go to the next higher level (e.g., instructor supervisor, flight
         commander/chief, squadron commander, or group commander) or appropriate outside
         office or agency to report it. Encourage trainees/students to report sexual assault in
         accordance with AFI 36-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR)
         Program. Identify support and investigative agencies, their contact numbers, and
         hotlines available to students and trainees who need assistance in resolving issues.
         9.2.6.9.2. Ensure the Lesson Plan Part II includes the following statement under
         sexual harassment and assault reporting teaching step: “Victims of sexual harassment
         and/or sexual assault in training environments are provided confidential access to
         victim support services. Victims will be afforded the necessary time for recovery and
         opportunity to make up training missed during the recovery period. Training may be
         made up through either special individualized assistance (SIA) or washback/recycle.
         How training will be made up will be determined by the instructor supervisor with the
         best interests of the student in mind and based on the amount of training that has been
         missed, complexity of the training, and other relevant factors.”
     9.2.6.10. Type 6 course orientation includes paragraphs 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2, 9.2.5.4, and
     others if applicable.
     9.2.6.11. BMT covers overview and administration information through a series of
     weekly training briefings and orientations.
  9.2.7. Integrate the following topics throughout the POI:
     9.2.7.1. Job-oriented Safety. Reference AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated
     Occupational Safety Instruction, technical data, and standard publications.
     9.2.7.2. Environmental Issues. Emphasize awareness on how job tasks impact the
     environment, such as water usage, pollution prevention, resource conservation, recycling,
     etc.
     9.2.7.3. Publications Awareness. Emphasize the importance of using publications, to
     include standard publications and technical orders, and that compliance with guidance in
     these publications is mandatory.
     9.2.7.4. Risk Management (RM). Weave risk management principles throughout the
     core curriculum in all courses, where appropriate. Job safety and risk management
     principles should be tied together. Stress the need to perform a real-time assessment prior
     to conducting each training activity involving a hazard. Emphasize that all Airmen
     (students and/or instructors) are empowered to call a “Knock-it-off” or “Time-out” if they
     have safety concerns or to inform others of a developing hazardous situation. Note:
     Reference AFI 90-802 for further guidance.
         9.2.7.4.1. For each teaching step or training activity involving any hazard that could
         cause mission degradation, injury, illness, or system damage, include RM assessment
70                                                              AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


         worksheet(s) from the training plan or course record set (for courses not requiring
         training plans, e.g. Type 2) as an attachment to the POI. Use the RM worksheet to
         assess the activity and include RM reference in instructional guidance. Note: Each
         time the activity is conducted, perform a real-time RM assessment based on current
         conditions. RM guidance must be detailed and provide faculty and staff with risk
         mitigation or risk control measures, by activity. Reference AFI 90-802 and AFPAM
         90-803 for further guidance on real-time RM assessment.
         9.2.7.4.2. The training group will determine where RM tags are placed in the LP,
         Part I and/or Part II when teaching steps are not part of the instructional design of the
         course and for T.O.-based courses.
     9.2.7.5. Energy Conservation. Where appropriate, weave principles of energy
     conservation throughout the curriculum in all courses. Guide students in recognizing
     correct and incorrect applications of energy conservation in the workplace and on the job.
     Focus on the application of energy conservation principles applicable to AFSC-specific
     job tasks and responsibilities. Use active learning techniques such as modeling, one-way
     stories, guided discussions, two-way stories, simulations, personal experiences, and case
     studies. Instructors will use their discretion as to the technique to be used.
     9.2.7.6. Core Values. Throughout the course, instructors will weave core values of
     integrity, service before self, and excellence in all we do throughout the curriculum. Use
     active learning techniques, called modeling, including one-way stories, guided
     discussions, two-way stories, simulations, personal experiences, and case studies.
     Instructor discretion determines which technique to use and when it will be presented.
     9.2.7.7. Air Force Doctrine. Air Force instructors (active duty and civilian) will
     introduce Air Force basic doctrine, available on the Curtis E. LeMay Center for Doctrine
     Development and Education website at https://doctrine.af.mil, to Air Force students in
     all initial skills courses. Throughout the course, instructors will “weave in” information
     about basic doctrine, using appropriate doctrine documents and active learning
     techniques. These techniques include, but are not limited to, guided discussion, two-way
     stories, simulations, past experiences, and case studies. Instructors will use their
     discretion as to the technique to be used and optimum time to inject Air Force basic
     doctrine.
     9.2.7.8. BMT will integrate physical conditioning standards as curriculum performance
     objectives. See AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program, for current standards.
  9.2.8. Do not republish a POI for minor changes that will not affect training resources or
  change the training standard level of support. The following guidelines apply for minor
  changes:
     9.2.8.1. To approve write-in or page changes, the TDE chief initials the annotated record
     set copy, or places an electronically signed document or email in the folder (for electronic
     record sets).
     9.2.8.2. The OPR forwards updated information to applicable offices to ensure all POIs
     correspond with the record set.
     9.2.8.3. Incorporate all annotations into the next published change.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                      71


   9.2.9. Piggyback Courses. When two or more courses have identical content (piggyback
   courses or an MTT), identify which is the mother course and which piggyback courses will
   be taught using the mother course documents.
       9.2.9.1. Initial skills piggyback courses attended by both Air Force officer and enlisted
       personnel require separate course builds in TTMS ICIS and Student Management.
       9.2.9.2. Advanced and supplemental courses attended by both officer and enlisted
       personnel do not require separate course numbers or course builds. Identify the course
       based on the predominant type of student attending.
   9.2.10. Common Training Courses. Ensure the POI Foreword identifies the common
   course as being for management and resourcing purposes only. Identify all “feeder” courses
   in the Foreword and describe how the common training fits into the “feeder” courses.
9.3. Distribution. Emails unclassified POIs and POI changes for courses awarding or desired to
award CCAF credit to CCAF Course Manager (CCAF/DEA) ccaf.cd@us.af.mil.
9.4. Classified POIs. Do not compromise the qualitative requirements for the administrative
convenience of using an unclassified document. Prepare classified POIs according to security
directives and local procedures. Modify covers for classified publications to comply with
security directives. For classified courses that have unclassified POIs with security markings
indicating course content classification level, include a statement at the bottom of each POI page
to explain that markings on the page do not refer to POI content. Note: Forward classified POIs
and course charts together for courses awarding or desired to award CCAF credit to AU/SSO,
Attention: CCAF, 401 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6428.
9.5. Lesson Plan (LP) Part II, Teaching Guide:
   9.5.1. Purpose. An LP is a detailed outline of information and activities used by instructors
   to guide and conduct the training activities prescribed in the POI. Use the corresponding POI
   page(s) as the cover page(s) for each unit’s LP. The signed POI page indicates LP approval.
   Note: An LP is not required for Type 6 courses designed for use without an instructor.
   9.5.2. Types. There are three types of LPs: master, personalized, and station.
       9.5.2.1. A master LP is an unpersonalized LP used for control and standardization of
       instruction in each course (except courses taught only once or twice a year). It is the
       standard against which instructor supervisors check all individual instructor LPs.
       Maintain at least one set of master LPs on all courses at the course level. The master LP
       does not require a signature and may be maintained on computer, electronic media, or in
       TTMS. Merging the LP Part I (POI) and LP Part II is not required for electronic master
       LPs.
       9.5.2.2. A personalized LP is an individual instructor’s LP that may include personal
       notes and information to aid the instructor and supplement the master LP.
           9.5.2.2.1. Examples of personalization include entries for the introduction and
           conclusion, and “right hand” notes that amplify and relate to the teaching steps.
           Personalization is optional, but highly encouraged, especially for new instructors.
           9.5.2.2.2. Identify personalized LPs as such by entering the instructor’s name in the
           POI template or AETC Form 133 “Name of Instructor” block.
72                                                                AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


         9.5.2.2.3. The instructor supervisor approves the LP, verifying the LP is accurate,
         applicable and adequate for presentation. A personalized LP must be approved
         before the instructor uses the LP to teach.
     9.5.2.3. A station LP is an LP that can be used by anyone teaching the lesson. It is
     particularly useful when teaching classified information since additional information may
     change the classification. A station LP may include standardized notes and supporting
     information in the right column/page and must be approved by the instructor supervisor.
     Identify station LPs as such, i.e., used by all instructors at a station, lab, or position. It is
     not personalized.
  9.5.3. LP Approval. The instructor supervisor reviews and approves personalized and
  station LPs prior to use and at least annually. The instructor supervisor’s approval certifies:
     9.5.3.1. The LP is current and matches the master LP.
     9.5.3.2. Any notes and/or supporting information are accurate, applicable, adequate, and
     personalized content is consistent with Air Force core values, policy, and guidance.
     9.5.3.3. Training programs containing content on radicalism, cultural awareness, and
     counterterrorism exhibit cultural sensitivity and respect for religion.
  9.5.4. Each instructor will use an approved LP identifying the training activities.
  9.5.5. The primary instructor must have an approved LP in the C/L. Supervisors may use a
  subordinate's lesson plan if substituting during an unexpected primary instructor absence.
  9.5.6. Developing LPs:
     9.5.6.1. Prepare an LP to guide training activities.
         9.5.6.1.1. Each training activity must be based on a learning objective.
         9.5.6.1.2. An LP is not required for units of instruction or objectives presented by a
         guest lecturer (a person not affiliated with the course). However, a list of objectives
         is required. Note: Review guest lecturer materials prior to presentation to ensure
         consistency with Air Force core values, policy, and guidance.
         9.5.6.1.3. For courses taught by guest lecturers, prepare a brief outline of the points
         the lecturer is expected to cover. Also, prepare an alternate plan for use in the
         lecturer’s absence. Note: Review guest lecturer materials prior to presentation to
         ensure consistency with Air Force core values, policies, and guidance.
     9.5.6.2. Use a three-part format for LPs.
         9.5.6.2.1. Introduction. Includes a review (as appropriate), attention, overview,
         motivation, and transition. Classified courses include classification level statement
         during introduction. Note: 2 AF units will use the 2 AF-developed warrior ethos
         vignettes as the motivation during the first hour of instruction daily.
         9.5.6.2.2. Body. Includes the presentation, application (students practice the skills
         and/or knowledge learned), and evaluation (students are evaluated on objective
         achievement), as applicable. BMT may add processing, fitness, personal needs,
         transit, and other topics, as applicable. Identify instruction methods in the lesson
         plan.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                     73


          9.5.6.2.3. Conclusion. Includes a summary, study assignments, remotivation, and
          closing. Classified courses include a classification reminder in the conclusion.
       9.5.6.3. Use the TTMS 2-column or 2-page format LP outline.
          9.5.6.3.1. Annotate course objectives, teaching steps, and technical information
          (including testable information) in the left column/page. Include sufficiently detailed
          support elements with each objective and teaching step to facilitate beginning
          instructor use.
          9.5.6.3.2. Annotate support material, planned         instructional   aide   use,   and
          personalization go in the right column/page.
       9.5.6.4. Course time is tagged to objectives in TTMS ICIS and aggregated to the unit,
       block, and course. The introduction, body, and conclusion do not have specific time
       allocations. Account for student break time in accordance with paragraph 8.2.1. The
       time indicated for each part of the LP is approximate and allows for a reasonable degree
       of flexibility.
       9.5.6.5. When a course includes a field trip, visit, or symposium away from the course
       environment, describe its purpose and content under the applicable objective in the LP.
       9.5.6.6. All teaching steps or training activities involving any hazard that could cause
       mission degradation, injury, illness, or system damage will be identified with an RM tag
       in TTMS ICIS. TTMS ICIS will place an RM tag in the left column/page of the lesson
       plan next to the teaching step. Include a reference in the right column/page to the RM
       assessment worksheet found in the POI attachment (see Figure 9.1). Note: The training
       group determines where to place RM tags in POI or LP Part II when teaching steps are
       not included in the POI or for T.O.-based courses.

                       STUDENT INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS

10.1. Purpose. Student instructional materials aid students in completing assigned training
activities.
10.2. Description. Student instructional materials may be standard publications, TOs,
commercial texts, and other published reference material, as well as locally produced handouts,
study guides, or workbooks, or programmed texts, videos, audio tapes, computer-assisted
programs, or note-taking devices. Locally produced student instructional materials may be used
separately or to augment other reference materials.
10.3. Technical Data Use. When Air Force technical data use is required for job performance,
integrate technical data use throughout the course. Students must use TOs, inspection work
cards, and checklists during system, subsystem, and support equipment operation and
maintenance. Maintain technical data as directed by Air Force.
10.4. Cost Effectiveness:
   10.4.1. Select the most cost-effective format for student instructional materials.    Reuse
   student instructional materials as much as possible. Avoid single use materials.
   10.4.2. Use available standard or specialized publications, such as AFIs and TOs, rather than
   locally developed student instructional materials whenever possible.           Extract, for
   reproduction only, those pages of the standard or specialized publication necessary for
   training. Use commercial publications (such as textbooks or reference books) when they
   support course objectives.
10.5. Currency:
   10.5.1. TOs, specialized publications, technical data extracts, and commercial publications
   should be as current as those used in an operational unit. Note: TOs and publications used
   by the 982 TRG to train tasks to the performance level must be current.
   10.5.2. Technical data extracts used to support performance objectives must be from current
   TOs and publications.
   10.5.3. TOs and publications used to support subject-knowledge objectives only may be
   outdated. Mark outdated publications and TOs that are not current with the TO catalog as
   “For Training Purposes Only.”
   10.5.4. Training libraries will be current unless changes adversely affect compatibility with
   training equipment, objectives, techniques, or curriculum.
       10.5.4.1. Maintain a current master reference copy of each training library title in the
       flight, squadron, or family group.
       10.5.4.2. If numerous TOs and publications are used in the same flight, squadron, or
       family group, maintain only one master reference copy. Mark others as “For Training
       Purposes Only.”
 76                                                              AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


   10.5.5. The TDE and SMEs will review TO and publication changes for curriculum
   compatibility. TO and publication updates that are not compatible with training equipment,
   objectives, techniques employed or that affect curriculum are not posted until equipment
   and/or curriculum is updated. Continue to post subsequent safety and other significant
   changes.
   10.5.6. Periodically review TOs marked “For Training Purposes Only” to ensure all safety
   and significant changes are posted.
10.6. Preparing Student Instructional Materials:

   and understand.
   10.7.5. Write clear, descriptive titles for figures, paragraphs, and chapters. Be specific and
   avoid one-word titles. Position illustrations as near as possible to the first paragraph that
   refers to the illustration. Always reference the figure before it appears in the text. Avoid the
   need to flip pages between text and illustrations.
   10.7.6. Edit carefully and rewrite to improve readability. Replace multi-syllable words with
   shorter words to improve clarity and readability.
   10.7.7. Spell out each acronym on first use. Spell out lengthy and uncommon acronyms
   intermittently to help students learn acronyms more quickly.
10.8. Review. Before publishing or reprinting student instructional materials or releasing

expenditures and student time away from home station. Prepare DL instructional materials as
outlined in this instruction, considering design, delivery characteristics, and management. See
AFH 36-2235, Volume 5, and AETCI 36-2208 for more information.
10.11. Type 6 DL Instructional Materials:
   10.11.1. AETC offers distance learning courses as an alternative to resident training.
   Training materials include a variety of media such as paper, interactive multimedia
   courseware, ITV, Internet-based instruction, or video tape. Analyze media options to match
   the most cost effective, appropriate media with each lesson objective. Courses may use a
   combination of media.
   10.11.2. Instructions for synchronous DL courses, where the instructor is conducting a
   course from a different location, should be easy to follow. Avoid lengthy instructions. Use
   broadcast time primarily for training. Use the DL POC or student handouts as much as
   possible to cover administrative issues.

                                        VALIDATION

11.1. Purpose:
   11.1.1. The purpose of validation is to identify and correct instructional system
   imperfections. The validation process is used to determine if instructional system content,
   sequence, methods, and media decisions are sound. These decisions are considered sound if
   the desired changes in student behavior are achieved with minimal time, money and other
   resource investment.
   11.1.2. Ideally, validation is a concurrent and continual process applied to the instructional
   system as portions are developed. Validation planning is part of normal course development
   and begins early in the process, addressing all aspects of the course development effort.
11.2. Procedures:
   11.2.1. Base validation primarily on student accomplishment of each objective. Consider
   comments from students and instructors who have completed the instruction.
   11.2.2. Validate as much of the course as possible before students arrive, such as content,
   sequence of objectives, visual aids, and training media.
   11.2.3. Write-in changes based on interim validation findings may be made to the course
   chart, POI, LP Part II, and student materials during validation. Write-in changes must be
   approved by the TM or TDE chief, as appropriate. Use a formal change memorandum to
   document write-in changes for each document.
   11.2.4. When course validation is completed, have the local MO re-price any course
   parameter changes. Update the training plan, as appropriate.
   11.2.5. Mother course validation validates piggyback courses if the piggyback course has not
   changed.
11.3. Planning:
   11.3.1. Validate new courses and major revisions that will be taught more than twice.
   11.3.2. Use at least three classes for validation. Fewer classes may be used if a three-class
   validation would take more than a year to complete. Use the minimum number of classes to
   validate the course and measurement.
      11.3.2.1. For Type 6 self-paced courses, validation requires at least 30 students.
      11.3.2.2. Synchronous DL course validation requires at least three broadcasts with a
      minimum of 30 students.
   11.3.3. Conduct validation classes under actual training conditions.
   11.3.4. Validation planning should address significant course development aspects, such as
   instructional methods and materials, time allocation, training equipment, alternate delivery
   and training media selection, and measurement. The plan tailors the process to development
   specifics. For example, if only one block of a course is revised, plan to validate only that
   block unless the changed block has a significant impact on course flow and sequence.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                     81


   11.3.5. Validation plans include the following:
       11.3.5.1. Start and end dates, and classes to be used.
       11.3.5.2. Blocks, modules, and units to be validated.
       11.3.5.3. Data to be collected and means of collection.
       11.3.5.4. Who will analyze the data and prepare the validation summary report.
11.4. Data Collection and Analysis:
   11.4.1. Collect at least the following data during validation classes:
       11.4.1.1. Student feedback data. Include student comments about course strengths and
       weaknesses.
       11.4.1.2. Training development and instructor personnel                 comments      and
       recommendations relating to items examined during validation.
       11.4.1.3. Formal measurement/assessment data, including:
          11.4.1.3.1. Progress check results on completed AETC Form 98 or locally approved
          checklist.
          11.4.1.3.2. Written test results on completed AETC Form 668 or a computerized test
          analysis.
          11.4.1.3.3. Performance test results on completed AETC Form 98 or locally
          approved checklist.
       11.4.1.4. Student washback and academic elimination data.
       11.4.1.5. Student remediation data (summary of remedial training for specific
       objectives).
       11.4.1.6. Resource problems or utilization data; summarize any shortfalls or constraints.
       11.4.1.7. Student background data.
   11.4.2. Analyze data to determine if course design, instruction, equipment, and/or materials
   meet objectives. Have SMEs check lessons for technical accuracy. Analysis should
   substantiate that time allocations and objectives are appropriate, especially for self-paced,
   supervised study, and directed study portions.
11.5. Reports. A validation report documents the actions taken to improve the course and helps
prevent duplication of effort. The report should be completed within 30 work days after
completion of the last validation class.
   11.5.1. Ensure the validation report includes the following:
       11.5.1.1. Summary of the validation process. Include deviations from the validation plan
       (with reasons for the deviations, number of classes, and students used) and interim
       changes made to control documents and instructional materials during validation.
       11.5.1.2. Constraints.    Identify any known resource constraints before or during
       validation.
 82                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


      11.5.1.3. Summary of significant findings. Include the number of washbacks and
      eliminations and the block or unit where these actions occurred. Address the adequacy of
      multiple instructor requirements and usage, objective times, and instructional materials.
      11.5.1.4. Conclusions and corrective actions. Summarize the ability of the validation
      process to provide the data needed to finalize the course. Include changes needed to
      finalize control documents, instructional materials and equipment, and actions taken or
      planned. Identify the planned implementation date of the finalized POI, recommended
      estimated completion dates for any open items, and identify the POC to correct validation
      findings.
   11.5.2. When possible, correct problems identified during validation before teaching the
   block or course again. Finalize course documents within 90 days of graduation of the last
   validation class, if possible.
   11.5.3. Maintain the validation report with the course record set. After the validation report
   is approved, source data need not be maintained.
11.6. Measurement Validation. Measurement validation ensures each measurement
instrument adequately assesses the student’s attainment of the instructional objective.
Measurement validation may or may not occur concurrently with course validation.
   11.6.1. Data from the first three administrations of each version of a measurement
   instrument usually provide sufficient information to complete the validation. Different
   validation parameters may be established based on student flow.
   11.6.2. Measurement validation should be completed in a year.
   11.6.3. Randomly generated computer measurement validation is accomplished by objective
   since each measurement presentation is different. This is normally completed after four to
   six administrations.
   11.6.4. During measurement validation, review measurement data after each administration.
   Annotate comments concerning any test problems on AETC Form 668 or in a computerized
   test analysis system. If the test analysis system has insufficient space, annotate a cross-
   reference to a word processing file.
   11.6.5. Analyze the measurement instrument as defined in AFMAN 36-2236, Chapters 25,
   and the high-miss items (50 percent or more missed), and determine if corrective action is
   required. If the course is under validation, consider the training activities for possible
   impact.
   11.6.6. Identify deficiencies in measurement items, instruction, training materials, etc., and
   correct as necessary. Record the name of the reviewer and when the review was conducted
   on AETC Form 668 or in a measurement review electronic file.
   11.6.7. Maintain individual student checklist results for the first three administrations of
   performance test and progress checks until completion of the validation summary. The TDE
   identifies measurement items missed by more than 50 percent of the students during their
   first attempt, and documents actions taken to correct deficiencies. Continue to maintain
   results until the deficiencies are corrected.

                                 TRAINING DEFICIENCIES

12.1. Description. A training deficiency occurs when a student or group of students do not
receive training on all items specified in the training standard prior to course graduation. There
are many situations/circumstances that may result in a training deficiency, such as
broken/unavailable equipment or a shortage of instructor personnel required to teach a specific
objective, unit, or block in the course.
12.2. Training Deficiency Alert. Alerts management the potential for a training deficiency
exists and allows units to take corrective action to avoid the training deficiency. Alerts should be
submitted as soon as a potential deficiency is identified.
   12.2.1. TRS will submit a training deficiency alert through the TRW/TRG to 2 AF/TTOC (2
   AF units only) and HQ AETC/A3T concurrently, stating the reason for the deficiency alert
   and the corrective action necessary to avoid the deficiency (see Attachment 10). Note: A
   training deficiency alert is not necessary if the deficiency cannot reasonably be avoided.
   12.2.2. If the TRW/TRG does not have the resources necessary to implement the corrective
   action, work with HQ AETC to secure the resources, as applicable.
   12.2.3. If a training deficiency is avoided, notify the TRW/TRG, 2 AF/TTOC (2 AF units
   only), and HQ AETC/A3T and identify any follow-up actions necessary.
   12.2.4. If a training deficiency cannot be avoided and all specified training cannot be
   completed prior to course graduation, submit a training deficiency report.
12.3. Training Deficiency Report. Informs management a training deficiency actually
occurred and corrective action needed to eliminate the deficiency.
   12.3.1. TRS will submit a training deficiency report through the TRW/TRG to 2 AF/TTOC
   (2 AF units only) and HQ AETC/A3T, and AFCFM (see Attachment 11) concurrently.
   Include the training standard number, date, and paragraph reference for which training was
   deficient; the proficiency code level required; the level of training provided; the number of
   deficient training hours; corrective action taken or planned; and the expected completion
   date. For training deficiencies expected to impact more than one class, include the projected
   number of classes and students that will be affected until the deficiency can be corrected.
   12.3.2. When training specified in the training standard is not provided before graduation,
   submit a training deficiency memo to the student's gaining organization. Include the training
   standard number, date, and paragraph reference for which training was deficient; the
   proficiency code level required; the level of training provided.
   12.3.3. When a training deficiency impacting more than one class is corrected, send a
   written notice of deficiency termination to the original report addressees.

                                          Chapter 13

                        NONRESIDENT TRAINING MATERIALS

13.1. Purpose. Nonresident training materials are provided to students at operational bases for
use in self-study or group-study training or combination of the two methods. These materials
may support career development courses (CDC) or specialized courses (SC). Note: These
training materials are not procured through or approved by the publications manager.
   13.1.1. TRG prepares Air Force CDCs, SCs and other training materials for use Air Force
   wide. The terms preparing agency and training group are interchangeable.
   13.1.2. All training groups (except Goodfellow AFB for cryptologic and certain other CDCs)
   send CDC and SC manuscripts to the Air Force Career Development Academy (AFCDA) for
   educational review, edit, test construction, publication, and administration.
   13.1.3. Type 6 distance learning is not included in this chapter. Type 6 course materials are
   prepared, distributed, and administered according to AETCI 36-2208 and as prescribed in
   other applicable sections of this instruction.
   13.1.4. When considering a CDC or SC as an option to meet training needs, see paragraphs
   5.2.6.6.2. through 5.2.6.6.2.3., and consider the following additional factors:
       13.1.4.1. AFS future population trend.
       13.1.4.2. AFS life-cycle training requirements.
       13.1.4.3. Proposed subject matter security classification.
       13.1.4.4. Number of current STS items that require knowledge upgrade.
       13.1.4.5. CDC scope relative to resources required.
       13.1.4.6. Available material from other services that will satisfy Air Force OJT and SKT
       requirements.
       13.1.4.7. Number of personnel in upgrade training who will use the CDC.
       13.1.4.8. Available in-house training in the using command(s).
       13.1.4.9. If the AFS is procedurally oriented and subject to frequent change or equipment
       oriented, consider the stability of the procedures or equipment in the Air Force inventory.
   13.1.5. The AFCDA Course Development Management Guide: Standards of Course
   Development, provides guidance on how to prepare and manage CDCs and SCs published by
   AFCDA. The guide can be found on the AFCDA SharePoint web-site under the Bookshelf
   link.
13.2. Writer Resources. Positions are authorized in the TRGs to support CDC-related projects.
Timely assignment of qualified personnel to CDC writer positions is essential to ensure trained
personnel are available for mission accomplishment. TRGs may request MAJCOM assistance to
prepare a new or revised CDC.
   13.2.1. Appoint an alternate POC when a CDC or SC writer is not assigned or is on an
   extended TDY or leave, scheduled to PCS, or retiring,
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                     85


      13.2.1.1. Promptly provide POC information to AFCDA. Include POC full name, rank,
      DSN, organization, street address, base/city, zip code (include the last 4) and courses for
      which he or she is responsible. Provide complete course numbers without an X in the
      number field, unless X is used in the official course number (i.e. 3E2X1 should not be
      used for 3E251 or 3E271).
      13.2.1.2. Indicate whether POC is the primary or the alternate, and provide guidance on
      the previous writer’s status (retired, PCS, TDY, etc.).
   13.2.2. CDC writers must complete training identified in AETCI 36-2202, Faculty
   Development and Master Instructor Programs. CDC writers should also attend MECI100,
   Course for Authors, as soon as practical.
   13.2.3. CDC writers earn the special experience identifier (SEI) 386, Instructional Materials
   Writer/Manager, after completing E6AILTXXXX 0C1A, Career Development Course
   (CDC) Writer, and 6 months of satisfactory writing experience.
   13.2.4. During preproduction planning and course production/development, CDC writers
   will not perform duties that negatively impact approved course chart submission dates. CDC
   writers will provide TRG CDC Manager, TM and squadron commander with a monthly
   production status update and notify them immediately of potential delays.
13.3. Career Development Courses (CDC):
   13.3.1. CDCs are self-study distance learning courses that provide airmen with fundamental
   AFS career knowledge. CDCs directly support the Air Force OJT program and Weighted
   Airman Promotion System (WAPS) SKT development.
      13.3.1.1. CDCs are developed as required by AFCFM.
      13.3.1.2. CDCs are not developed solely to support SKT development.
   13.3.2. CDCs provide the career knowledge requirements to support skill-level upgrade as
   listed and coded in the current STS.
   13.3.3. CDCs provide only the career knowledge component of STS tasks.
      13.3.3.1. Coordinate with the AFCFM when CDC content cannot be developed to
      correlate with STS knowledge levels. Document rationale and AFCFM concurrence in
      the CDC case management file.
      13.3.3.2. Consult AFCDA about using multimedia enhancements to achieve designated
      knowledge proficiency levels.
   13.3.4. Notify the AFCFM if STS requirements in the CDC columns cannot be achieved and
   the STS needs revision.
13.4. CDC Development Process:
   13.4.1. Consider CDC requirements during STRTs, training planning teams, STS
   preparation, and U&TWs. An AFCDA representative and CDC writers should participate in
   these processes, if possible.
   13.4.2. Establish and document CDC requirements in the CFETP, including a customer need
   date (date the CDC should be available to the field). Note: The actual CDC activation date
86                                                            AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


  depends on all volumes being published and available for distribution. AFCDA will activate
  a course as close to the need date as possible, but a precise date may not be feasible.
  13.4.3. The customer need date is impacted by the CDC delivery date. The delivery date is
  the date when the CDC is available from AFCDA.
  13.4.4. The AFCFM normally establishes the customer need date for the CDC in the CFETP
  and U&TW minutes after consulting with TM, AFCDA, and CDC writer to ensure that
  customer need date can be realistically achieved.
  13.4.5. Ideally, CDCs resulting from an STS change that also impacts resident training
  should be activated and available by the graduation date of the first students from the
  associated resident course.
  13.4.6. When a CDC requirement is generated by factors that do not result in a new or
  revised STS or CFETP, the AFCFM must approve the requirement in writing.
  13.4.7. Volume Revisions and Changes:
     13.4.7.1. Use “write-in” changes for a few minor typographical errors, word or phrase
     substitutions.
     13.4.7.2. Use page changes or separate supplements when less than 40 percent of the
     course material must be changed.
     13.4.7.3. Rewrite the course when more than 40 percent of the material changes as a
     result of procedures or CFETP requirements. The AFCFM may elect to continue using
     the existing CDC or deactivate the course and develop interim career knowledge
     reference to use until the new CDC is published.
  13.4.8. Production Plan. The CDC writer establishes a production plan for developing and
  delivering new and revised volumes to AFCDA, based on estimates in AFI 36-2201, Chapter
  5. The CDC writer identifies time compression or delay sources that may affect delivery
  dates. See Attachment 12 for example CDC production plan.
     13.4.8.1. The CDC writer identifies the customer need date, projected delivery date to
     the field by AFCDA, and manuscript submission dates on the production plan and AETC
     Form 469, Career Development Course Chart. See Attachment 13 for example AETC
     Form 469.
     13.4.8.2. The TDE Chief reviews the production plan and AETC Form 469 and signs the
     AETC Form 469.
     13.4.8.3. The TM coordinates on the production plan and AETC Form 469 and signs the
     AETC Form 469.
     13.4.8.4. The TRS/CC approves the production plan and AETC Form 469 by indorsing
     the production plan and signing the AETC Form 469, ensuring proposed manuscript
     submission dates support desired activation dates, or are prepared as quickly as the scope,
     project complexity, writer availability, and other factors allow.
     13.4.8.5. Provide copies of the production plan and signed AETC Form 469 to the HQ
     AETC/A3T TPM, AFCDA, and HQ AETC A3/AAD.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                    87


      13.4.8.6. If submission dates cannot be met, the CDC writer drafts a production slippage
      memorandum that includes a revised production plan with new submission dates and an
      explanation of factors that affected production. Coordinate the memorandum through the
      TM to the TRS/CC for approval. Forward a copy of the approved memorandum to the
      HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
      13.4.8.7. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will advise the AFCFM of any CDC development
      deviations impacting the customer-need date agreed upon at the U&TW.
   13.4.9. Change Supplements. Change supplements to existing CDCs are normally
   prepared within 30 calendar days from an identified need. The CDC writer prepares and
   coordinates AETC Form 469 through the TM to the TRS/CC for approval. Provide copies of
   approved AETC Form 469 to the HQ AETC/A3T TPM, AFCDA and HQ AETC A3/AAD
   30 calendar days before submitting a change supplement to AFCDA. Note: Unless a safety
   issue or pressing technical requirement exists, add supplements to printed course materials
   the next time the course is packed.
13.5. General Preparation:
   13.5.1. CDC preparation time requires careful allocation. Work on the CDC should begin
   with notification of AFS change approval or any other event that initiates an STS change.
   The time between the first alert of a change and course chart/production plan approval is the
   most critical phase, during which the writer should complete detailed research and course
   planning.
   13.5.2. CDC writers will research other services’ correspondence courses and procure
   correspondence materials (catalogs and courses) as required by AFI 36-2230(I).
   13.5.3. Content and Preparation. CDCs provide AFS career knowledge and support
   WAPS/SKTs. CDCs are specialty oriented and do not teach specific equipment, weapons
   systems, or work centers (except career ladders with multiple AFSs or AFSC shreds).
      13.5.3.1. CDCs will not duplicate information provided by other Air Force training
      programs, such as ancillary training or PME. Limit CDC content to AFSC knowledge.
      When PME or ancillary training provides general task knowledge required for a
      particular STS item, include in the CDC the specific type and title of PME or ancillary
      training course. The CDC may contain applications of these topics that are unique to the
      AFSC.
      13.5.3.2. CDCs should contain enough information to illustrate basic principles,
      techniques, and procedures, and how they apply to common AFS systems and situations.
      CDCs may address specific equipment items only when a piece or type of equipment best
      illustrates procedures or techniques useful to the overall AFS.
      13.5.3.3. CDCs must provide enough information to meet STS proficiency codes to
      ensure the correct training level is provided.
      13.5.3.4. Consider occupational survey data, if available, when translating broad STS
      tasks into CDC content. Use CDC course documents and the administrative file to
      document the process.
      13.5.3.5. Content may include a knowledge review to introduce new material or
      reinforce previously learned material.
 88                                                              AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


      13.5.3.6. Design CDCs as self-contained packages. Trainees should be able to complete
      the entire package without referring to outside sources, except classified CDCs.
   13.5.4. STS Correlation. Document correlation between course outline key topical
   statements and applicable STS task or knowledge statements, proficiency codes or behavioral
   statements. Use an STS or locally devised correlation instrument to link topical statements to
   the STS items.
      13.5.4.1. Unit review exercises and course examinations must measure material to the
      correct STS proficiency level.
      13.5.4.2. Career ladders with multiple AFSs and/or shreds have STS tasks common to
      several or all specialties in the ladder. Some STS tasks may be common to two or more
      related career ladders. Identify and organize such common task information into
      common sections, chapters, or volumes, and then designate those as applicable to the
      appropriate CDCs. Common material normally addresses several subjects and has
      limited application. Identify common material to AFCDA.
   13.5.5. Job Safety. Integrate job safety training throughout the publication.
   13.5.6. Copyrighted Material. Obtain permission to use copyrighted material during the
   project planning stage. Keep releases on file. Provide one copy of the copyright release to
   AFCDA with the manuscript and one copy to SAF/GCQ in accordance with AFI 51-303.
   Refer to AFI 51-303 and to the Staff Judge Advocate for proper procedures concerning use
   of and obtaining releases for copyrighted material and trademarks.
   13.5.7. Direct Communication. Writers should communicate directly with industry,
   MAJCOM, and other Air Force activity representatives to obtain copyright releases, source
   materials, or other information required to prepare CDCs. TDY visits are acceptable if
   necessary.
   13.5.8. Classified Material. Prepare classified publications according to Air Force and
   DoD security requirements. Ensure manuscripts processed through AFCDA do not contain
   classified information.
13.6. Manuscript Preparation:
   13.6.1. Refer to the AFCDA Course Development Management Guide: Standards of Course
   Development for the format and guidance on preparing manuscripts (except classified
   CDCs).
   13.6.2. Failure to adhere to format standards will be grounds for rejection of
   materials/manuscripts.
   13.6.3. Submit each volume manuscript to AFCDA on or before the established submission
   date documented on the AETC Form 469. To assist AFCDA editorial staff, submit each
   volume as soon as it is completed.
13.7. Prepublication Quality Control:
   13.7.1. Review CDC documents and manuscripts for technical accuracy and adherence to
   quality standards. Use AETC Form 158, CDC Quality Control Checklist, to conduct
   technical, quality and final reviews. Technical, quality and final reviewers initial in blocks 1
   through 4, as appropriate. Each reviewer will complete block 6.
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                       89


   13.7.2. Technical Review. At least one AFSC-qualified individual, other than the CDC
   writer or TDE chief, conducts the manuscript technical review to ensure CDC texts support
   learning objectives. Technical reviewers may be from outside AETC.
   13.7.3. Quality Review. A CDC writer, other than the author, conducts the quality review.
   Quality reviewers should be experienced writers and may be from any AFSC. Quality
   reviewers will verify that manuscript scope and depth support approved course control
   documents (STS and course chart), and that course content reflects writing technique
   standards established in the Course Development Management Guide: Standards for Course
   Development. CDC manuscripts must be technically accurate, grammatically sound, error
   free, and include all illustrations.
   13.7.4. Final Review. The TDE chief conducts the final review to certify that all required
   STS knowledge items have been translated to learning objectives of the appropriate scope
   and level and the publication is consistent with Air Force doctrine, existing law, and national,
   DoD, and Air Force policies.
13.8. Approving Official Certification. The TM approves the release of the manuscript for
publication using AETC Form 107, Annual or Special Review Record, certifying the publication:
   13.8.1. Is necessary to the Air Force mission, and is consistent with Air Force doctrine,
   existing law, and national, DoD, and Air Force policies.
   13.8.2. Is current, technically accurate, and adequate.
   13.8.3. Is directed to a specific audience.
   13.8.4. Does not include information that conflicts with, belongs in, or duplicates another
   publication.
   13.8.5. Does not include training offered locally, or through any PME or ancillary training in
   an Airman's career.
   13.8.6. Does not include information that could adversely affect public opinion. CDCs or
   SCs containing content on radicalism, cultural awareness, and counterterrorism must exhibit
   cultural sensitivity and respect for religion.
   13.8.7. Uses gender-neutral language and maintains propriety and good taste.
   13.8.8. Does not imply in any way the Air Force endorses, favors, or restricts the use of a
   commercial product, commodity, or service.
   13.8.9. Does not include copyrighted material without a legal release.
   13.8.10. Does not include classified information unless necessary. Classified CDCs must be
   properly marked and controlled according to applicable security directives.
   13.8.11. Covers all required STS items to the correct proficiency levels.
13.9. Manuscript Submission to AFCDA (Except Classified CDCs). Submit manuscripts
either electronically or hard copy in accordance with AFCDA guidance. In the memorandum of
transmittal, identify a new writer's first manuscript so AFCDA can provide quick review and
feedback. Note: Do not delay submitting subsequent manuscripts waiting on AFCDA feedback.
13.10. Priority Processing:
 90                                                            AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


   13.10.1. When a CDC revision is considered critical, the TM sends a priority assignment
   request to AFCDA with a copy to the HQ AETC/A3T TPM. The request must include
   justification to support the requirement.
   13.10.2. Changes that affect personnel safety or may result in equipment damage are
   authorized first priority and do not require separate action. The CDC writer submits a change
   marked “first priority” and submits the priority request memorandum of transmittal to
   AFCDA.
   13.10.3. HQ AETC A3/AAD, in conjunction with AFCDA, coordinates WAPS-critical CDC
   processing priorities. Material submission dates, pre-existing course development
   requirements and the SKT project schedule will determine if and when priority will be
   warranted.
13.11. Manuscript Processing:
   13.11.1. AFCDA instructional system specialists review for instructional adequacy,
   organization, readability, style, format, and conformance to prescribed methodology and
   provide feedback to the CDC writer, as appropriate. The CDC writer corrects the
   manuscript, as applicable, and returns it to AFCDA.
   13.11.2. CDC writers conduct a prepublication review of each CDC examination prepared
   by AFCDA for technical accuracy. Communicate directly with the AFCDA course
   development team responsible for the specific course. Changes are coordinated with
   AFCDA and confirmed in writing. The CDC writer destroys examination manuscript copies
   upon receipt of published copies. Employ appropriate safeguards including those applicable
   to computer systems to prevent measurement material compromise. Safeguard course
   examinations and accompanying materials according to AFCDA test review and change
   procedures. Mail examinations according to AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel
   Testing System.
   13.11.3. AFCDA prepares and sends a monthly manuscript status report to each TRG
   designated level, which includes manuscript status, a list of manuscripts that are past the
   stated submission date, a list of manuscripts on hold or returned as unsatisfactory (showing
   the number of days late and reason for delay), and a list of courses activated.
13.12. SKT Development Support. SKT development schedules are often based on the
scheduled CDC manuscript availability dates. Submitting CDC manuscripts on schedule is
critical to SKT support. Inform HQ AETC A3/AAD and AFCDA of manuscript submission
delays so they can determine if published CDCs will be available for the scheduled WAPS
testing cycle.
13.13. CDC Course Reviews. CDC course reviews are conducted after publishing to ensure its
currency, technical accuracy, and information adequacy.
   13.13.1. Initial. The CDC writer conducts an initial review of the newly published CDC
   upon receipt from AFCDA to ensure consistency with the original manuscript submitted and
   technical accuracy. Mark the AETC Form 107 initial review block. Document errors but
   make no text changes at this point.
   13.13.2. Annual. Annual reviews of CDCs are conducted on the anniversary date of the
   terminal volume publication. Review CDCs for essentiality, currency, technical accuracy,
AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014                                                                  91


   and adequacy. CDCs used in the field should be reviewed as scheduled even if the CDC is
   being revised, edited, or published. Inform AFCDA, by memorandum, when a program
   change will significantly alter how many Airmen use the CDC to prevent excessive or
   inadequate stock on hand. Continuing a CDC with fewer than 26 enrollments per year must
   be justified for cost effectiveness.
   13.13.3. Special. Conduct a special review whenever a significant AFSC change is
   implemented (i.e. following a U&TW, new equipment model fielded, T.O. or publication
   change, etc.), a new STS is published or revised, requested by AFCDA because of a high
   failure rate or low enrollment, and/or in conjunction with an OAR review. Check AFCDA
   volume review records to identify possible recommendations or future revisions. A special
   review may replace a scheduled annual review if conducted within 30 calendar days of the
   terminal volume publication anniversary date.
   13.13.4. For annual and special reviews, include average scores and first-time pass rate in
   Block V, Remarks, on the AETC Form 107. Refer to the AFCDA Course Analysis Report
   for this and other CDC statistical data that may be applicable.
   13.13.5. Use AETC Form 107 to document review results. Provide a copy of the AETC
   Form 107 to the HQ AETC/A3T TPM. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will advise the AFCFM of
   the recommendation.
13.14. CDC Feedback:
   13.14.1. Student and supervisor surveys. Surveys are emailed to students and supervisors
   to measure satisfaction with the content quality and applicability, service efficiency, and
   solicit improvement input. Personal information is maintained according to Air Force policy
   and federal law. AFCDA personnel compile responses and make the data available to
   AFCFMs and CDC writers.
   13.14.2. Course Examination. AFCDA collects data on and develops course examination
   statistical analysis. Statistical analysis shows individual item performance and indicates
   overall student performance on the course examination. AFCDA reviews the analysis and
   provides a copy to the CDC writer, who uses the data to evaluate course effectiveness and
   determine future disposition of course components. Refer to the Course Development
   Management Guide: Standards for Course Development for guidance on reading analysis
   reports.
   13.14.3. SKT/CDC/STS Compatibility Critiques. CDCs are the source for SKT item
   development. When appropriate, the SKT team identifies specific STS and CDC currency,
   relevancy, or coverage areas that need improvement.
      13.14.3.1. HQ AETC A3/AAD forwards an SKT/CDC/STS compatibility critique with
      comments and recommendations to the CDC writer.
      13.14.3.2. The CDC writer reviews the critique, takes necessary action, and provides an
      itemized critique response to TM, the TRG evaluation section, HQ AETC A3/AAD, and
      the HQ AETC/A3T TPM. Responses are used by the next SKT writing team.
      13.14.3.3. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM forwards a copy of the critique response to the
      AFCFM.
 92                                                             AETCI36-2641 26 JUNE 2014


   13.14.4. Student Inquiries. AFCDA forwards technical inquiries to the CDC writer for
   reply. CDC writers should answer student inquiries promptly. Document student telephone
   and email inquiries. Course examination question inquiries require the same safeguards as
   the examination itself.
13.15. CDC Deactivation. Deactivate CDCs and existing enrollments if a course review,
STRT/U&TW, or other event identifies a CDC as no longer required or the CDC does not meet
the knowledge requirements of AFS identified in the CFETP/STS. The CDC writer coordinates
deactivation rationale with the HQ AETC/A3T TPM. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM will forward
the rationale to the AFCFM for review and approval. Deactivation requires AFCFM approval.
If approved, the AFCFM notifies HQ AFPC/DPSIT and AFCDA the CDC is being deactivated.
13.16. Specialized Courses (SC):
   13.16.1. These self-study distance learning courses extend the educational and training
   capabilities of Air Force schools to eligible personnel worldwide. SCs may be used for
   upgrade training and to meet requirements outside the scope of CDCs. The SC is not
   normally based on an STS or used as a WAPS source reference.
   13.16.2. New SCs require Air Force-level approval. Submit new SC production plans to the
   appropriate AFCFM. Production plans for revisions are approved locally.
   13.16.3. Prepare SC production plans in the same format as CDC production plans. For new
   courses, also include justification for the proposed courses in terms of Air Force quantitative
   requirements, a summary or outline of the proposed content, and recommended enrollment
   criteria.
   13.16.4. Conduct annual and special reviews of SCs to validate requirements for the course
   and currency of course content. Conduct annual reviews on the anniversary of the course
   activation. Conduct special reviews when significant changes to the AFSC or course subject
   are implemented. Document annual and special reviews on AETC Form 107.
   13.16.5. When an SC is no longer required, send a deactivation request with detailed
   rationale through the HQ AETC/A3T TPM to the AFCFM. Upon approval, notify AFCDA
   in writing.

                                     SERVICE TESTING

15.1. Purpose. Service testing allows units to try out ideas and innovations to enhance training
efficiency and effectiveness within existing resources. These ideas and innovations must have an
anticipated benefit and/or savings to the Air Force. Examples of service test candidates include
changing instructional methods or media, testing methods, or instruction sequences, or
implementing temporarily training changes dictated by time constraints and customer needs.
15.2. Procedures:
   15.2.1. Training squadrons develop a service test plan. This plan identifies the specific
   changes to be made to training, the anticipated benefit, and the test period with specific start
   and end dates.
   15.2.2. The service test plan is forwarded to the HQ AETC/A3T TPM for review and
   approval. Do not proceed with the service test without HQ AETC/A3T TPM approval.
   15.2.3. Course documentation is exempt from inspections until conclusion of the test, but the
   process is subject to inspection, and such documents as the measurement plan may be
   reviewed to ensure TS requirements are met.
   15.2.4. Use validation procedures to collect and report findings (see Chapter 11).
   15.2.5. For courses attended by enlisted members, email revised and modified course control
   documents (course charts and POIs) for courses awarding or desired to award CCAF credit to
   CCAF Course Manager (CCAF/DEA) ccaf.cd@us.af.mil for CCAF credit evaluation at least
   14 days prior to class start date.
   15.2.6. Send classified course charts and POIs together, via registered mail or secure email
   in accordance with applicable security directives to AU/SSO, Attention: CCAF, 100 South
   Turner Blvd, Maxwell AFB Gunter Annex AL 36114.
   15.2.7. Upon completion of the test, objectively evaluate findings and use validation report
   procedures to report results to the HQ AETC/A3T TPM (see Chapter 11).
   15.2.8. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM approves any permanent changes to the course validated
   by the service test.

                                          Chapter 16

                              PERIODIC COURSE REVIEW

16.1. Purpose. Periodic course reviews are accomplished as part of the ISD evaluation process.
The review examines course feedback data and course documents to determine if the course is
still needed, meets customer requirements, provides relevant skills and knowledge, duplicates
training in other courses, and is properly resourced.
16.2. Procedures:
   16.2.1. Conduct a periodic course review on:
       16.2.1.1. All Type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, A, B, C, W, and faculty development courses every
       2 years.
       16.2.1.2. BMT every 3 years as part of the triennial review process.
   16.2.2. Review Types 5 and B to ensure courses still meet Air Force needs and do not
   duplicate training.
   16.2.3. Use the anniversary month of the training standard to determine the review period.
   Use results from course reviews to initiate changes, as applicable.
   16.2.4. Periodic course review is not required if a course revision is scheduled to implement
   within 120 days or the entire course is in validation. Instead, place a memorandum for record
   indicating such, with the projected revision or validation completion date, in the course
   record set. If implementation or validation completion is delayed, document the reason for
   delay, along with the new implementation/completion date, on a memorandum for record and
   place in the course record set.
   16.2.5. Periodic course review is not required if a course will be discontinued within 6
   months. Instead, place a memorandum for record in the record set identifying the course will
   be discontinued.
   16.2.6. During a periodic course review, analyze:
       16.2.6.1. Course feedback data (FEQs, EOC, course validation data, as applicable).
       16.2.6.2. OAR (if dated after date of training standard) for changes impacting course
       training standards.
       16.2.6.3. Training standard to ensure only relevant skills and knowledge are presented.
       Note: Questions to consider during analysis include: Are any skills and/or knowledge
       out of date? Has new equipment been fielded? Do the skills and/or knowledge duplicate
       training in other courses? Do the skills and/or knowledge meet customer requirements?
       Are the skills and/or knowledge still needed?
       16.2.6.4. Course chart and POI to ensure appropriate time is allotted to course and
       objectives.
       16.2.6.5. POI to ensure objectives support training standard tasks and knowledge.

       16.2.6.6. Method of instruction for each objective to ensure it is the cost effective and
       efficient. Consider various alternative methods of training delivery, to include IMI, DL,
       etc. Refer to AETCI 36-2208 for additional guidance.
       16.2.6.7. Course equipment lists to ensure equipment supports training objectives.
       Identify excess equipment, if applicable
       16.2.6.8. LPs and student instructional materials to ensure they adequately support the
       training objectives and POI.
       16.2.6.9. All student measurement devices to ensure they accurately measure the
       proficiency in each task or knowledge element in the training standard.
       16.2.6.10. TPS data entries to ensure data entries match approved training plan course
       parameters.
       16.2.6.11. CTP and any applicable ATPs to ensure consistent and accurate information
       within the documents.
       16.2.6.12. Foreign disclosure memorandums to ensure they are current for latest course
       revision/change.
       16.2.6.13. ETCA in accordance with paragraph 2.2.2.2.
16.3. Documentation. Document the review analysis and submit a report to HQ AETC/A3T
TPM within 90 days of anniversary date. Identify deficiencies and corrective actions in each
area analyzed. If training duplication exists, include rationale or corrective actions taken to
eliminate duplication.

Terms
Abbreviated Training Plan—Means to make changes in resources and/or manpower
requirements or to add/remove motivational training to/from an existing CTP. The abbreviated
training plan is an addendum to the certified CTP, addressing only those specific areas of the
original CTP that were changed.
Appraisals—A group of questions and/or projects used to check day-to-day learning; used
informally during teaching-learning activities to help determine student comprehension and
progress. The appraisal can be used in consideration for washback and advancement, but not to
satisfy an objective.
Base Operating Support—Any base activity supporting technical training that is not typically
funded with technical training dollars. Examples include dining halls, dormitories, child care
centers, transportation, civil engineering, hospitals, force support functions, etc.
Behavior—Specifies what a student must do to satisfy a job performance requirement. Behavior
may involve recall, manipulation, discrimination, problem-solving, performing a step-by-step
procedure, or producing a product.
Behavioral Statement—Statement of the behavior the student must exhibit. If a condition or
standard is needed to clarity the behavior, either or both should be included.
Block of Instruction—One or more related units or modules grouped to cover course major
subject or task areas.
Career Field Education and Training Plan—Comprehensive core training document that
identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and
minimum core tasks requirements for a specialty.
CerTest—Certification and Testing
Classroom/Laboratory—Location where classes meet and training is conducted. Time spent
in a classroom/laboratory environment is dedicated to student course objective achievement.
Instructional methodology may vary, but a qualified instructor must be present during this time.
Common Training Courses—Courses used to price manpower from multiple courses using the
same curriculum. Common training courses have no schedules of their own and are usually
identified by a “T” or a “U” in the fourth position of the course number.
Condition—Specified limits under which behavior is performed. Conditions may include the
use of specific TOs, or equipment provided to perform a task during which the behavior will be
demonstrated. Conditions may also be information provided to guide action a specific way.
Course Chart—Document that outlines general course structure and content by block and unit
of instruction. It also provides course parameters and other course data for staff personnel.
Course Content—Knowledge and skills, including proficiency levels, identified in the
applicable training standard which will be taught. Adding or deleting tasks, or changing
proficiency levels constitutes a course content change. Rearranging objectives, reallocating

              MANPOWER RESOURCE DECISION LOGIC NARRATIVE

Note: Use this narrative to develop and process the training plan manpower annex. Before a
course can be activated and conducted, HQ AETC/A1MRT must validate the manpower annex,
and HQ AETC/A3T must certify the training plan. Manpower annexes either have no manpower
impact, or require additional manpower resources from the wing, AETC, or the using commands.
Once manpower resources are available or appropriate workarounds coordinated and approved,
the HQ AETC/A3T TPM will certify the training plan and notify the TM, HQ AETC/A1MRT, 2
AF/TTOC, and local MO. For Type 5 medical courses, HQ AETC/A3T TPM works with HQ
AETC/SG and AFMOA to validate manpower resource estimate received from METC.
A3.1. TM Requests Annex. TM forwards a manpower annex request to the local MO when a
course transfers from one base to another, existing course parameters changes (such as course
length [days or hours], MIRs hours, program group size, or shift limit), or when developing a
new course.
A3.2. Local MO Develops Annex. The local MO develops the manpower annex using data
from the TM and appropriate databases, and validates the manpower-related data.
A3.3. Local MO Forwards Annex. Local MO sends the manpower annex to the TM.
A3.4. TM Reviews Annex. If no additional manpower is required, the TM includes the annex
in the CTP. If additional manpower is required the TM seeks offsets/manpower as follows:
A3.5. TM Seeks Offsets Locally. If manpower offsets are not available in the TRS, the TM
contacts the TRG for availability within the TRG or TRW.
   A3.5.1. If manpower offsets are available, the TRG notifies the TM. The TM identifies the
   offsets to local MO, who annotates the offsets in the manpower annex and finalizes the
   annex.
   A3.5.2. If manpower offsets are not available locally, the TM will notify local MO who
   finalizes the annex.
A3.6. Local MO Finalizes Annex. The local MO finalizes the annex and forwards the final
annex to the TM to include in the CTP.
A3.7. TM Finalizes Training Plan. TM forwards the completed and approved CTP to the local
MO.
A3.8. Local MO Forwards Approved Training Plan. The local MO prepares a memorandum
summarizing any manpower impacts, attaches the memorandum to the approved training plan,
and emails the complete package to HQ AETC/A1MRT with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/A3T
TPM no later than 60 days prior to course implementation date
A3.9. Manpower Requirements Validation. HQ AETC/A1MRT validates manpower
requirements and forwards a recommendation to HQ AETC/A3RB-TT, with a courtesy copy to
HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
   A3.9.1. If offsets are available within the command, HQ AETC/A1MRT, HQ AETC/A3R,
   and the HQ AETC/A3T TPM work to identify and allocate the offset to the course. HQ

   AETC/A1MRT validates the annex and notifies the HQ AETC/A3T TPM, TRW/MO, and
   the TM. HQ AETC/A3T certifies the training plan.
   A3.9.2. If offsets are not available within AETC, the HQ AETC/A3T TPM contacts the
   AFCFM to request manpower from using commands.
   A3.9.3. If the AFCFM secures manpower from using commands (to be used by AETC as
   instructors, SMYs, or support personnel), the losing commands transfer the authorizations to
   HQ USAF/A1M. HQ USAF/A1M transfers them to HQ AETC.
   A3.9.4. For medical courses, if offsets are not identified by HQ AETC/SGU, then HQ
   AETC/SGU coordinates requirements with HQ USAF/SG.
       A3.9.4.1. If offsets are acquired, HQ AETC/SGU notifies the HQ AETC/A3T TPM. HQ
       AETC/A3T certifies the training plan.
       A3.9.4.2. If offsets are unavailable, HQ AETC/SGU notifies the HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
A3.10. TM Coordinates Workarounds. If manpower is unavailable, the TM coordinates with
the HQ AETC/A3T TPM and AFCFM to identify workarounds to satisfy the training
requirement until resources are available.

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject
not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.
- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is
provided in the course or CDC.
X This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due
to limitations in resources.
Note: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

This revision incorporates the MEP-806A Tactical Quiet Generator into supplemental course
training. The Tactical Quiet series generators are DoD replacement units for existing MEP-004
through -012 series. Existing course material on the MEP-007B and MEP-012A generators was
reduced to incorporate MEP-806A training in the current course length.

                                CDC 3N0XX PUBLIC AFFAIRS JOURNEYMAN


1. The current Career Development course, 3N0XX, published in 2009, must be revised to correct inaccurate
information and to deemphasize subjects/material in accordance with current public affairs programs and
procedures. Also, the CDC extensively uses AFI 35-101 as its reference source; AFI 35-101 has been updated since
the current CDC was published.
2. The decision to revise the 3N0XX CDC was made after discussion with the career field manager and other
subject matter experts.
3. The career field conducted a Utilization and Training Workshop March 17-21, 2012. The update to the CDC will
involve only minor revisions to the current information and some restructure of the content for clarity.
4. Units/sections of the CDC will be renamed and rearranged to accurately identify subject matter and better
organize like information.
5. Projected CDC activation date. The customer need date is (ddmmmyy). The CDC will be activated
(ddmmmyy). The submission schedule proposed accounts for the following events which impact the manuscript
submission and AFCDA delivery dates:
       (Identify any events such as deployment, TDY, etc., that will impact CDC production)
Manuscript submission dates for each volume are:
       Volume 1 – (ddmmmyy)
       Volume 2 – (ddmmmyy)
Final submission date of the terminal volume is (ddmmmyy). Upon receipt, AFCDA requires xxx days for
processing. This puts the projected delivery date to the field as (ddmmmyy).
6. Address questions or concerns about this production plan to the CDC writer at (email address) or call DSN xxx-
xxxx.
