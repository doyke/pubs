    3.3. Monitoring and Notification of Heat Stress Index:
        3.3.1. BEF will monitor WBGT from 01 June through 30 September unless weather
        patterns (unusually hot or cold) indicate and adjustment is warranted. When the ambient
        temperature reaches and remains at or above 85 ˚F, the Heat Stress Index will be
        monitored at least hourly by BEF until the Heat Stress Index reaches below 85 ˚F or
        1700 hours, whichever comes first.
        3.3.2. Heat Stress Advisories will be disseminated every time the Heat Stress Index
        changes IAW Attachment 2.
        3.3.3. The BEF will notify Command Post when change in Heat Stress Index occurs with
        the following initial message:
“Heat Stress Advisory. IAW MAFBI 48-102, the current Heat Stress Index for (day, month, and
time) is (__._) degrees F. This is within the _______ zone. This information is updated at least
hourly. During duty hours, direct any questions to Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight. After
hours, contact Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight technician on-call via phone at 316-213-
4671.”


    3.4. Guidelines for Occupational Heat Exposures:
        3.4.1. Personnel who routinely perform their jobs while exposed to hot environments
        (such as aircraft maintenance and ground maintenance) are occupationally exposed.
        3.4.2. Supervisors of occupationally exposed personnel should use Attachment 2 to plan
        work and rest cycles for individuals under their control per AFPAM 48-151, Thermal
        Injury.
        3.4.3. Heat Stress Index exposures above 90˚F should be allowed only when performing
        mission essential duties and only then with caution.
4                                          MCCONNELLAFBI48-102 16 SEPTEMBER 2010


       3.4.4. When necessary to accomplish a task, two or more details should be arranged to
       work in sequence to ensure each crew receives the proper work and rest cycle.
4. HEAVY, RESTRICTIVE                 CLOTHING          AND         PERSONAL       PROTECTIVE
CLOTHING:
    4.1. Wear of overly bulky and restrictive clothing (e.g., chemical warfare defense ground
    crew ensemble: CWDE) places an added heat stress burden on individuals. If personnel are
    wearing CWDE or other heavy, restrictive clothing, a correction factor must be added to
    report Heat Stress (WBGT) Index to account for added physiological stress. See
    Attachment 2 for guidance.
       4.1.1. Personal protective clothing considerations and recommendations will be
       addressed by BEF during routine Occupational Health Assessment.
5. SUPERVISOR/INDIVIDUAL CONSIDERATIONS:
    5.1. Ability to adjust and tolerate heat varies with the individual. Some of these factors are:
       5.1.1. Acclimatization (body’s ability to adjust to heat).
       5.1.2. Duration of exposure.
       5.1.3. Amount of work to be performed.
       5.1.4. Air movement and humidity.
       5.1.5. Type of clothing worn.
       5.1.6. Physical fitness.
    5.2. Recognition of Heat Stress Disorders. When one or more of the following symptoms
    occur, an evaluation by a physician should be sought.
       5.2.1. Impaired mental function.
       5.2.2. Weak and/or rapid pulse.
       5.2.3. Loss of bowel or bladder control.
       5.2.4. Dizziness, faintness or weakness.
       5.2.5. Muscular cramping or convulsions.
       5.2.6. Nausea or vomiting
6. PREVENTION OF HEAT STRESS ILLNESS OR INJURY
    6.1. Acclimatization - This is of utmost importance for new arrivals from cooler climates.
    This process takes ten to fourteen days and is directly related to the heat stress imposed on
    the individual. A period of acclimatization is required for all personnel regardless of each
    individual’s physical condition. An individual is considered acclimatized if he or she has
    undertaken regular exercise for longer than 10 days in the same environmental conditions as
    the proposed activity.
    6.2. Encourage Water Intake. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring water is available.
    Water must be readily available of a primary work area. Do not use thirst as an index of how
    much to drink; drink more than you think you might need. Small amounts of water (one pint
MCCONNELLAFBI48-102 16 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                     5


   every hour) are encouraged during periods of moderate activity when exposed to hot
   temperatures.
   6.3. Obtain adequate rest before physical exertion.
   6.4. Avoid strenuous exercise during hottest hours.
   6.5. Wear loose clothing to permit the passage of air.
   6.6. When possible, schedule heavy work during the cooler early or late hours of the day.
   More frequent rest periods may be necessary.

Terms
Acclimatization.—A period of adjustment an individual’s body requires becoming accustomed
to working in hot environments. Full acclimatization occurs through progressive degrees of heat
exposure and physical exertion. Adaptation typically occurs during the first 10 to 14 days of
heat exposure and the largest change occurs at days 3 to 5. An individual is considered
acclimatized if he or she has undertaken regular exercise for longer than 10 days in the same
environmental conditions as the proposed activity. However, adaptation is lost within a few
weeks unless the exposure to heat is repeated regularly at intervals of four days or less. If
exposure to the hot environment has followed a substantial period of travel or crossing time
zones, the acclimatization time must be assumed to be longer than 10 days.

Heavy (Hard) Work.—Examples include: Walking on hard surface at 3.5 mph with >40 lb
load, and walking on loose sand at 2.5 mph with load, armament crew, heavy aircraft repair, and
NBC reconnaissance.
Moderate work.—Examples Include: Walking on hard surface at 3.5 mph with <40 lb load,
walking on loose sand at 2.5 mph with no load, patrolling, refueling, low crawl, high crawl,
defensive position construction, and field assaults.
Light (Easy) Work.—Examples include: Walking on hard surfaces at 2.5 mph with <30 lb
load, weapons maintenance, manual of arms, tower operations, pilot ground activities,
marksmanship training, and drill and ceremony.
Heat Stress.—Heat stress is the combination of environmental and physical work factors that
constitute the total heat load imposed on the body. The environmental heat stress factors are air
temperature, radiant heat exchange (example, sunlight), air movement, and relative humidity.
Physical work contributes to total heat stress through the body’s production of heat (metabolic
heat) as it burns energy to sustain the work. This production of metabolic heat depends on the
intensity of the physical effort, which is affected, in turn, by body size, muscular developments,
physical fitness, and age.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index.—The WBGT Index is a combination of
temperature measurements which consider dry air temperature, relative humidity, and radiant
heating. The equation for the WBGT Index uses dry bulb (DB) temperatures, natural wet bulb
(NWB) temperatures, and globe (GT) temperatures. Heat Stress Index is synonymous with
WBGT Index.
