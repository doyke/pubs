                                           COMMANDER’S SAFETY PHILOSOPHY




                               SAFETY IS EVERYONE’S BUSINESS
        Commanders and supervisors must take a personal and proactive approach to
        safety. Every member of Team Goodfellow absolutely MUST internalize and
        integrate safety principles and risk management into his or her life, both on
        and off the job. Your safety officer is you! You can’t delegate this critical
        task to anyone else. You are also a safety wingman, ensuring everyone
        around you is safe. We must ensure our people have the resources and proper
        conditions to work safely. Safety is a key part of all we do, and I expect your
        complete dedication to work and play safely…24 hours a day!
