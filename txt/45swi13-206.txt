This instruction establishes policies, procedures and responsibilities for scheduling operations on
the 45th Space Wing (45 SW) Eastern Range (ER). It defines the processes by which 45 SW
resources are committed to support range operations and maintenance required to maintain an
executable launch schedule as defined by AFSPCI 10-1213. These processes allow for the
scheduling of ER assets in support of ballistic missile launch operations, spacelift, surveillance,
aircraft test flights and other operations requiring ER assets. The provisions contained in this
instruction apply to all personnel and agencies requiring the use of ER controlled range resources
and the providers of those resources. Refer recommended changes and questions about this

                                            Chapter 1

                                            GENERAL

1.1. Scheduling Mission. The 1st Range Operations Squadron’s Scheduling Section (DOUS) is
the single scheduling authority for all launch, launch associated tests and internal range activities
requiring ER and 45 SW support resources excluding base support and 45 SW Safety Office
functions. Their mission objective is to ensure that all launches, operations and associated tests
are fully supported on the dates and times requested by the range customer, or as close to the
requested date and time as possible. DOUS will consider mission priorities, range capabilities,
economy of operations, funding availability and established safety and security criteria when
processing and prioritizing authorized schedule requests.
1.2. Operating Policies.
     1.2.1. Support commitment. Range resources are committed for support upon request and in
     accordance with applicable Operations Directives (ODs), internal test directives and
     technical support requirements. Resources are allocated so that the maximum number of
     operational requirements can be supported safely and efficiently. Range resources include
     (but are not limited to) instrumentation, airspace, radio frequencies, support facilities and
     base support services.
     1.2.2. DOUS operates primarily on a first come-first served basis, with certain exceptions.
     Launch and launch related milestone requests are processed in the order in which they are
     received. Other support requests (including internal range maintenance and testing) are
     scheduled based on range priorities and resource availability. All requests for operational
     support using 45 SW resources will be requested through and scheduled by DOUS.
     1.2.3. Authorized Schedulers. DOUS will only accept operational support requests
     (scheduling requests) from authorized scheduling representatives who have been formally
     designated in writing by their unit commanders (or equivalent commercial project directors)
     and submitted to DOUS (see Attachment 1 for example). The designated individuals will be
     authorized to request launch/pre-launch operations and obligate the expenditure of program
     funds. They must have firsthand knowledge of their program’s scheduling requirements and
     be familiar with Eastern Range operations. Also, they must be fully entrusted with decision-
     making scheduling authority for their program. Authorized scheduler letters will be updated
     annually or when personnel changes occur. Newly designated schedulers are highly
     encouraged to meet with DOUS prior to scheduling operations on the ER for a scheduling
     process orientation.
     1.2.4. Scheduling Conflicts. Scheduling conflicts that arise during operations will be up-
     channeled to the on-console Range Control Officer (RCO), Program Support Manager (PSM)
     or DOUS as appropriate. All other scheduling issues or conflicts will be resolved by DOUS
     through direct negotiation with the affected parties (and/or support agencies) or elevation
     through the chain of command (after DOUS involvement) when appropriate.
     1.2.5. Scheduling Priorities. DOUS serves as the 45 SW’s impartial scheduling broker via
     the philosophy that launch operations, major milestone/critical path test operations and
     associated pre-launch checkouts have the highest priority and take precedence over re-
     occurring/non-launch institutional test operations. Priorities are listed numerically from
45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014                                                                        5


  section 1.2.5.1 (highest priority) to section 1.2.5.4 (lowest priority), and are also ranked
  within each section. Priorities are as follows:
     1.2.5.1. Wing approved launch dates will be given the highest priority, followed by other
     range activities.
     1.2.5.2. Corrective maintenance to restore an ER resource to a Fully Mission Capable
     (FMC) condition for an approved launch, pre-launch or other critical path operation will
     take precedence over other non-critical instrumentation requirements.
         1.2.5.2.1. CLSRB coordinated and approved maintenance downtimes will have the
         same priority as an approved launch date and will require 45 OG/CC and 14AF
         concurrence to be rescheduled.
         1.2.5.2.2. Planned Depot Maintenance (PDM) and range modernization operations
         may be rescheduled by DOUS if the asset is required to support an approved launch
         date and/or a critical milestone in support of an approved launch date.
     1.2.5.3. Critical milestone pre-launch certification/calibration/test operations that must
     be successfully completed on the dates requested to meet an approved launch date shall
     have precedence over a less time sensitive operation which, if scheduled for another date
     or time, would not result in a launch date change.
     1.2.5.4. Scheduling of mission console training operations to fulfill 45 SW crew mission
     readiness certification requirements for the next scheduled launch will have priority over
     the scheduling of recurring/upgrade training and/or familiarization/proficiency
     simulations.
  1.2.6. Additional factors such as inter-range support requirements, worldwide
  communications, national urgency, limited orbital parameters, space or scientific
  achievement, DoD exercises and some maintenance activities (such as SLRSC major
  modifications) will be strongly considered when determining scheduling priorities and can
  drive an increased priority for a request. Personnel crew rest requirements will be considered
  when scheduling any activity. In the event of unresolved scheduling conflicts excluding
  launches, DOUS will assign priorities, with OG/CC concurrence, when placing operations on
  the range operations schedule. Receipt of launch date requests to DOUS establishes
  precedence for launch date queue consideration should previously scheduled launch dates
  become available.
  1.2.7. L-1 day checks contained in OD-12 (ER Instrumentation Set-up and Checkout) are
  normally scheduled during standard duty hours on the last workday prior to each launch.
  These checks are assigned the same priority as the associated launch operation. It is range
  policy not to schedule L-1 day checks after normal duty hours or on weekends or holidays.
  After L-1 checks are completed, the range will be in a “Locked Down for Launch” status that
  prevents any change in configuration. “Locked Down” status can only be waived by the 1
  ROPS/CC or DO.
  1.2.8. Customers are encouraged to submit all schedule requirements by noon Thursday a
  minimum of two weeks in advance of the requested date. Acceptance of requests after this
  cut-off date will be considered based on criticality, range priority, resource availability and
  other relevant factors.
 6                                                                   45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014


     1.2.9. In order to maximize range resource utilization efficiency and minimize non-
     recoverable support periods, the scheduling of requirements on a non-interference basis
     (NIB) is discouraged.
     1.2.10. Due to limited range resource availability, the practice of requesting additional time
     or “back-up dates” in anticipation that a problem may develop when conducting an operation
     is prohibited. When unanticipated problems do occur, a real-time request for an extension
     should be submitted to DOUS. The extension request will be evaluated on a real-time
     situational basis.
1.3. Days and Hours of Operation.
     1.3.1. The 45 SW operates the ER based on a standard Monday thru Friday, 40-hour work
     week. Operational requests for support by wing and/or contractor personnel for overtime
     work to be performed outside of normal duty hours or on weekends and/or federal holidays
     will not normally be approved. Exceptions to this policy will be coordinated through the 45
     SW Program Lead and/or the 1 ROPS Program Support Manager (PSM), through DOUS
     and then forwarded to 1 ROPS/CC or DO for adjudication. 45 OG/CC will have final
     approval authority. See paragraphs 1.4 and 1.5 of this instruction for a description of
     overtime rules, responsibilities and exceptions.
     1.3.2. DOUS is operated Monday-Friday (0600L-2200L) and Saturday/Sunday (0800L-
     1600L). DOUS is closed on federal holidays. Scheduling support is also provided during all
     launch countdown operations and other specifically designated operations occurring outside
     of normal duty hours. Staffing will normally be for the entire range minus count prior to the
     planned T-0 (unless directed otherwise) and will remain through completion of the operation
     and post-operation activities.
     1.3.3. Range contractor instrumentation support is available 0730L-1615L, Monday thru
     Friday. Set-up and post-op time outside of this window is considered overtime.
1.4. Overtime Operations.
     1.4.1. The 1 ROPS/CC in coordination with the appropriate PSM and Budget Analyst
     normally serves as the reimbursable Job Order Number (JON) approval authority for
     scheduling support requests outside of normal duty hours. The PSM and Budget Analyst are
     responsible for confirming that the requesting range users (both commercial and government)
     have sufficient funding available to cover civilian and contractor overtime expenses.
     Overtime support will be dependent upon PSM coordination and confirmation of resource
     and personnel availability.
     1.4.2. 45 OG/CC serves as the overtime approval authority for all non-reimbursable JON
     (institutional/direct funds) overtime charges. These requests will be routed through 1
     ROPS/CC prior to requesting approval from 45 OG/CC. Users are required to notify DOUS
     as far in advance as possible (and NLT 48 hours prior) when requesting overtime operations.
1.5. After Hours Range Support. Requests for scheduling support after normal range
operating hours will be coordinated through DOUS by contacting the off-duty Range Scheduling
Duty Officer (RSDO) at 321-759-6943.
45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014                                                                     7


   1.5.1. Overtime operations extensions (operations that are in progress during non-duty
   hours) may be granted if instrumentation and personnel are available and crew rest
   requirements will not be exceeded.
1.6. Hazardous Operations. Hazardous operations will be scheduled in compliance with
Eastern/Western Range EWR 127-1, Range Safety Requirements and AFSPCMAN 91-710,
Range Safety User Requirements unless a waiver is obtained. In addition, the hazardous
operations must be approved by 45 SW/SE. Compliance requirements apply to launches, pre-
launch and countdown operations, operation of high-pressure systems, handling of propellants,
radioactive source handling, corrosion control maintenance and other activities. Radioactive
source handling by active duty/government employees must be approved by 45 AMDS/SGPB.
1.7. Operational Resource Certification. Under normal circumstances, range instrumentation,
communications and data systems (both hardware and software) will be committed for use by ER
customers only after these systems have been operationally certified and accepted by the wing.
1.8. Scheduling Office Contact Telephone Numbers. Eastern Range Scheduling Manager:
321-853-2012 / DSN 467-2012; Forecast Scheduling Manager: 321-853-5947 / DSN 467-5947;
Real-Time Scheduling: 321-853-5941/2/3/4 / DSN 467-5941/2/3/4; Forecast Scheduling: 321-
853-2031 / DSN 467-2031
1.9. Program Support Manager. The Program Management Section (1 ROPS/DOUF) is the
range customer’s primary point of contact for document generation activities to include
obtaining, coordinating and defining customer and range safety operational requirements and OD
development. The PSM is responsible for all Universal Documentation System (UDS) actions
and will coordinate supporting range(s) and base agency support as documented in UDS prior to
the mission execution phase. The PSM also advises range operators and range contractor
personnel on program requirements.
1.10. Customer Contact Policy. Point of contact telephone number(s) for both duty and non-
duty hours are required for each operation. After hours point(s) of contact must be directly
connected to each scheduled operation, must have “decision-making authority” and must be
reachable by phone for the entire duration of the operation. Operations will not be scheduled
without customer points of contact.
1.11. Universal Documentation System. ER missions are conducted utilizing the UDS, which
was implemented by the Range Commander’s Council as the national standard for documenting
range operational requirements. DoDD 3200.11 directs the use of UDS; it incorporates program
and safety requirements into a single tasking document known as the Operations Directive (OD).
The OD defines operational requirements and is used by DOUS to schedule and task operational
systems and base support agencies. It also provides the basis for charging customers for the
support provided by the ER. The UDS is divided into three levels:
   1.11.1. UDS Level One. Level One UDS documentation initiates program support planning
   between range users and 45 SW. Level One establishes program scope, program support
   activities and acceptance by 45 SW of range user programs. Level One UDS documentation
   is normally generated for all new 45 SW programs.
   1.11.2. UDS Level Two. Level Two UDS documentation provides additional information
   not covered under Level One. Level Two provides detailed systems-level information and
   requirements. Range customers generate this information in the Program Requirements

    Document (PRD). The PRD is required to assess range support capability and to plan
    accordingly. Wing response to the PRD is by means of the Program Support Plan (PSP).
    The PSP constitutes ER commitment to support the customer’s program requirements.
    1.11.3. UDS Level Three. UDS Level Three documentation consists of the Operations
    Requirements (OR) document generated by the customer and submitted to the PSM. The
    range responds to OR requirements by generating the Operations Directive (OD). The OR is
    used to define the program’s requirements for pre-launch and launch testing. OR documents
    are generally due to the range 60 days prior to first support and the OD is normally produced
    30 days prior to first support. The signed OD is the source documentation used by customers
    to schedule all pre-launch tests and identifies 45 SW launch requirements. The OD is
    approved by appropriate program’s PSM. For further information, refer to 45 SWI 99-101,
    45th Space Wing Mission Program Documents.

                                   RANGE SCHEDULING

2.1. 45 SW Range Scheduling. 1 ROPS/DOUS operates the Real-Time Scheduling Element
(current date +9 days out), the Advanced Forecast Scheduling Element (+10 days and out) and
the Airspace Management Element.
2.2. Current Launch Schedule Review Board (CLSRB). 1 ROPS/DOUS is the 45 SW OPR
for CLSRB meetings. The CLSRB is chaired by the 14 AF/CC and is the governing body for
launch scheduling and approval of the 24 month Current Launch Schedule (CLS). The wing
launch schedule is briefed to senior leaders during the CLSRB and at government Launch Queue
Board integration meetings. DOUS also supports heritage launch systems and other CLSRB
related meetings as required.
   2.2.1. CLSRB Launch Slot Allocations. The CLSRB determines an executable plan for
   conducting space launch operations and serves as the approval authority for launch slot
   allocation of Air Force Space Launch Complexes. The CLS is an agreed-to launch schedule
   plan for missions from zero to 48 months in the future. When an official launch date changes
   within the first 24 months of the CLS period, the 45 SW/CC has the approval authority to
   commit ER resources to a modified supportable launch date for a user, provided all
   customers (launch vehicle, payload, maintenance, etc.) concur. When customers do not
   concur and issues cannot be resolved by the wing, 14AF/A3 may review the issue and
   attempt to resolve any conflicts. If conflicts still cannot be resolved, an out-of-cycle CLSRB
   may be convened to adjudicate the disagreement. Changes to the launch forecast that are
   more than 24 months from an approved launch date will be coordinated by DOUS.
2.3. Electronic Maintenance and Operations Coordination Center (EMOCC)
Webpage. The EMOCC web site is managed by DOUS at URL: https://emocc.patrick.af.mil
and was established to provide users instant access to the “real time” range schedule and updated
launch status information. The website is available to personnel with 45 SW Local Area
Network access. Wing members are encouraged to complete the access form on-line for an
EMOCC account. Direct questions concerning EMOCC webpage account or access issues to: 1
ROPS/DOUX.
2.4. Forecast Element. The Forecast Scheduling Element is responsible for performing all
scheduling and de-confliction actions beyond the currently scheduled week. The Forecast
Element is also responsible for compiling the 90-Day Range Forecast, the Advanced Forecast
Schedule and the Wing Launch Manifest for the 1 ROPS/CC, generating and coordinating 45
SW Launch Approval Requests (Shark Sheets), developing and publishing Launch Hazard Area
maps and administering the 45 SW Space Launch Intrusion Prevention Plan. They also build the
initial base of the official range schedule. All customer requirements (except launch dates and
critical milestones), should be submitted no later than 2 weeks prior to the needed date. Late
requests (received after the 2-week deadline point) will only be accepted when there are no
conflicts during the requested time frame and the request is supportable.
   2.4.1. Current range scheduling information can be viewed on the EMOCC website.
   Arrangements to receive paper or electronic copies of the schedule can also be made by
   contacting DOUS directly. Once the official weekly schedule has been electronically posted,
 10                                                                 45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014


   all current scheduling responsibilities (current date +9 days out), are transferred to the Real-
   Time Scheduling Element.
2.5. Real-Time Element. The Real-Time Scheduling Element is responsible for performing all
scheduling and de-confliction actions during the current week. Changes or additions to the
current week’s schedule will be accepted based on criticality, range priorities, resource
availability (instrumentation and personnel) and any other factors DOUS considers necessary to
accomplish the mission. New requests for range support will not preempt previously scheduled
range activities unless mission priority dictates or there is full agreement between all parties
concerned and the agreement is approved by DOUS. Requests must be received NLT 1200L the
day prior to the operation’s start date. In addition, the requestor must follow up the request with
a phone call to ensure DOUS received the request and to confirm the request is supportable and
will be added to the following day’s schedule.
2.6. Airspace Element. The Airspace Scheduling Element is responsible for the scheduling and
de-confliction of restricted/Special Use Airspace requirements in support of launch operations
and coordinating airspace requirements including (but not limited to) Notice to Airman/Notice to
Mariners (NOTAMS/NOTMARS), Prior Permission Required (PPR) requests, Launch Hazard
Area notifications, Unmanned Aircraft System operations, laser operations and other associated
mission areas. Refer to 45 SWI 13-201 Eastern Range Airspace Management Procedures for
more detailed information and airspace requirements for ER customers.
2.7. Range Scheduling Meetings. DOUS hosts two re-occurring weekly scheduling meetings
to allow ER users to participate in the planning and negotiation for allocation of ER resources
and to produce a conflict-free and precise launch operations schedule. All agencies requesting or
providing support must be represented at these meetings. Conflicts will be identified and
resolution options will be discussed and approved. Users requesting support which potentially
displaces previously scheduled operations will attempt coordination with the existing user for
alternative support solutions. DOUS will review negotiated compromises for ER supportability
and approve acceptable requests.
   2.7.1. The DOUS Forecast Element chairs the Launch Planning and Status Meeting for the
   purpose of discussing the launch schedule, operational issues, maintenance and range
   modernization activities and any other issues that affect range users and providers. A free
   and open discussion of issues is promoted. Range user representatives and range resource
   providers should make every effort to attend this meeting to obtain knowledge of forecasted
   resource requirements, scheduling changes, and to provide insight into their program’s status
   and requirements. Meetings are normally held each Monday (federal holidays excluded) at
   the Morrell Operations Center (MOC) room 106 at 0930L. Telecom capability is available
   for those who cannot attend in person.
   2.7.2. The DOUS Real-Time Element chairs the Range Instrumentation Scheduling Meeting
   for the purpose of finalizing all range operations and instrumentation support requirements
   for the following week’s range schedule. This critical meeting also performs a “quality
   check” review of the following week’s range operations schedule and identifies any conflicts
   or operational/scheduling discrepancies. All agencies requesting support or tasked to provide
   support are required to attend. Final conflict resolution is usually implemented at this time.
   Meetings are normally held each Thursday, (federal holidays excluded) at the Morrell
   Operations Center (MOC) room 155A at 0900L. Participants include range instrumentation
45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014                                                                   11


  super system representatives (command, radar, communications, telemetry, optics, computer
  ops, timing, etc.), section managers, range contractors/engineers, PSMs, authorized program
  schedulers and other agencies. If any tasked agency cannot attend the meeting, they must
  either call into the meeting or download the weekly instrumentation schedule from the
  EMOCC website and de-conflict the following week’s scheduled operations against their
  instrumentation areas to ensure there are no unsupportable resource requirements or
  scheduling conflicts. They are then required to contact DOUS by 1600L the same day
  (Thursday) and concur or non-concur with the following week’s schedule.

                                           Chapter 3

                             RANGE SCHEDULING PROCESS

3.1. ER Scheduling Process. ER operations schedules will be generated based on range user
mandatory requirements and will fulfill less-than-mandatory requirements with remaining
resources, taking into consideration national priorities, requested launch dates and the efficient
and economical use of range assets. The following paragraphs describe the range scheduling
process in greater detail.
   3.1.1. JON Information Requirements. All schedule requests must include valid JON
   information as well as other pertinent details to facilitate coordination and scheduling of
   resources. Requests will not normally be accepted without valid JONs.
   3.1.2. 45 SW/XP is the wing’s initial point of contact for new programs. Assistance in
   establishing new customer-funded JONs can be obtained from 45 SW/XP as required. The
   practice of charging internal range JONs (institutional/direct funds) shall be avoided.
   Customer JONs will be charged when range support is provided.
3.2. Launch Scheduling Requirements. DOUS will process Initial Launch Capability (ILC)
requests to ensure all range and safety requirements can be supported. Requests can be made via
the 45 SW Form 2050 (Launch Operation Scheduling Request) or a company letterhead
equivalent and must be received by DOUS NLT 90 days prior to the requested launch date. The
request must contain the launch date, UNCLASSIFIED launch window/period, expected launch
time and valid JON. The request must also include a list of all major milestones, the dates and
instrumentation requirements for these milestones, and identify a 24 or 48 hour recycle
opportunity (if required). For missions that require additional recycle opportunities (inter-
planetary, orbital or other unique requirements), the customer should notify DOUS as soon as
possible so they can secure approval and protect those opportunities when de-conflicting the 45
SW launch manifest. The primary method to deliver requests to DOUS is via e-mail at
1ropsched@us.af.mil. Other acceptable methods to deliver requests to DOUS include U.S.
mail, e-mail, FAX or hand-delivered. Verbal and/or telephone requests to DOUS for support
will require an e-mail or FAX confirmation. All requests sent by e-mail and FAX should be
confirmed by the requester via telephone within 15 minutes of transmission. For launch requests
that have not been approved by the CLSRB process, an AF Form 2010 (Launch Forecast
Request) requesting the ILC date with all applicable information should be submitted to DOUS
as soon as it is known, and definitely NLT 90 days prior to the requested launch date. Final
approval is contingent upon receipt of the required form with the original signature. Approved
launches and associated major milestone/critical path activities already on the schedule will have
priority over a new launch request unless otherwise coordinated and approved. It is range policy
that only one launch date can be requested and processed at a time, therefore multiple launch
date requests will not be accepted. Range users may submit changes to their initial launch date
requests to DOUS using updated 45 SW forms, a signed and dated facsimile request or a signed
and dated memorandum or company letterhead equivalent. Electronic signatures on all methods
of change requests are acceptable.
   3.2.1. Launch Date Changes. Requests for changes to the 45th Space Wing Launch
   Manifest must be coordinated through DOUS to determine availability of range resources to
45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014                                                                      13


  accommodate the proposed date change. In evaluating the request, DOUS will consider
  possible impacts to critical path pre-launch operations required by other users to meet their
  currently scheduled launch date(s). Submission of formal written change requests to DOUS
  is required with final approval authority contingent upon receipt of signed request. When
  customer change requests are submitted, it is range policy that the currently approved launch
  date is relinquished. The launch will be removed from the schedule and the relinquished date
  becomes immediately available to other customers. The mission is then placed into a
  “Pending” status until the new launch date request has been processed, de-conflicted,
  coordinated and approved. DOUS recommendation for acceptance will be based on
  sufficient range turnaround allowances for instrumentation support resources to transition
  from the nominal T-Zero time of one mission type to the nominal T-Zero time of a following
  mission type (see para 3.11). In addition, if the launch date change meets any of the criteria
  outlined in AFSPCI 10-1213, Attachment 1 (Significant Scheduling Actions), DOUS must
  coordinate the request with 14 AF (AFSTRAT) prior to approving the request.
  3.2.2. When launch date changes occur, range scheduling activities become labor intensive
  due to the necessary rescheduling of associated launch support operations. Some of these
  rescheduling actions can cause significant impact to other range customers. Therefore, users
  are strongly encouraged to relinquish launch dates as soon as it is determined that the
  currently approved date cannot be achieved. In addition, it is highly recommended that the
  rescheduling of pre-launch activities be delayed until a new achievable launch date is
  determined. If there is an extended scheduling delay, it is recommended that associated
  launch operations be removed from the schedule entirely to free up range resources for other
  customers.
  3.2.3. Launch Opportunities. A range user’s requested launch date is scheduled as a single,
  officially approved date with the understanding that if the launch cannot be completed on the
  scheduled (first attempt) date, range resources will be de-conflicted for a second launch
  attempt (usually on the following day). Launch vehicles that require more than 24 hours to
  recycle may request a 48-hour recycle (second attempt) on their initial launch request. Due
  to limited range resources, range users will not normally be pre-approved for more than one
  24 or 48 hour recycle opportunity on their launch request. Following are some additional
  parameters:
     3.2.3.1. If a range user requests a launch date that would allow them only one launch
     attempt prior to a first attempt date for another previously approved user, the requester
     will be informed that only one launch attempt is available. If the range customer does not
     agree to this condition, DOUS will present alternative dates where two consecutive
     opportunities can be provided. In cases where the customer accepts a single launch
     opportunity and is not successful on their launch attempt, they must agree to move to a
     later date that is open and supportable by the range.
     3.2.3.2. If a range user desires to submit a launch or operation request based upon the
     expectation that a previously approved range user will not require a second day of
     opportunity, they must agree to move to alternate dates if the previously scheduled user
     elects to use a second attempt day. Any range user wishing to advance ahead of, insert
     themselves between or propose minimum turnaround times following a previously
     approved launch date may negotiate a schedule change, provided mutual agreement is
     obtained from all users, range capabilities can support and DOUS approves the change.
 14                                                                 45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014


       3.2.3.3. Crew Rest. For advance planning purposes, a 10-hour uninterrupted period of
       time is required to maximize crew rest following an in-count launch scrub. In addition,
       there are other crew rest constraints that DOUS must take into account when assessing
       launch operations support scenarios (such as maximum days worked consecutively,
       maximum hours worked in one day, maximum hours worked in a seven day period, etc).
       Prior approval is required from wing leadership for requests that will result in waiving 45
       SW crew rest guidelines.
3.3. Launch Schedule Conflict Resolution.
   3.3.1. Inter-range scheduling conflicts will be resolved in accordance with this instruction.
   3.3.2. 45 SW launch scheduling conflicts will be resolved in accordance with AFSPCI 10-
   1213 and this instruction.
   3.3.3. Range users requesting launch dates in conflict with other launch dates or scheduled
   maintenance may negotiate support accommodations with an existing operation provided
   mutual agreement is obtained from the parties impacted and ER capabilities can support the
   change. When negotiation between users is not possible, DOUS will offer alternative options
   (if available). If proposed solutions are not acceptable to the involved parties, DOUS will
   inform the user the conflicting request is rejected.
3.4. ER Launch Approval Process. For most launch operations, the CLSRB process
establishes the Current Launch Schedule (CLS) on the ER. The 45 SW/CC is the final approval
authority for all ER launches. DOUS processes initial (and rescheduled) launch requests by de-
conflicting and coordinating requirements with supporting agencies (including other ranges) and
previously scheduled users (if impacted by the new request). Once support agency concurrence
is received and all supportable critical path operation dates are de-conflicted, DOUS will forward
the Shark Sheet for 45 SW leadership concur/non-concur and approval/disapproval action.
Coordination sequence is as follows: 1 ROPS/CC, 45 LCG/CC, and 45 OG/CC for concur/non-
concurrence and then to 45 SW/CC for final approval/disapproval action. If launch date changes
or additions require 14 AF coordination IAW AFSPCI 10-1213, Attachment 1, no changes will
be made to the official schedule and 45 SW leadership coordination will not take place until the
coordination with 14 AF has occurred. DOUS will advise the designated customer POC of
launch request status and disposition. (Note: 45 SW/CC has the authority to amend or rescind an
approved Shark Sheet at any time). Agencies requiring specific notification of schedule changes
should furnish their requirements to DOUS. Notifications of schedule changes will be made as
soon as possible. Rescheduling of a launch operation which advances the launch date and time
by more than 12 hours from the originally scheduled date and time will be coordinated by DOUS
with Launch Safety Analysis (45 SW/SELF) prior to approval for adequate pre-mission safety
data processing time.
   3.4.1. An “Approved” launch date triggers automatic pre-launch range activities (mission
   meetings, NOTAM/NOTMAR requests, range reconfiguration, Space Launch Intrusion
   Prevention Plan procedures, etc) that are executed by the 45 SW and the contractor. The 45
   SW/CC has the authority to remove unattainable launch dates from the schedule if reasonable
   doubt exists that the launch service provider can achieve the scheduled launch date. The 45
   SW/CC also has the authority to downgrade the launch service provider from “Approved” to
   “Planning” status so as to preclude the 45 SW from expending manpower, resources and
   finances in support of an unattainable launch date. The launch service provider may re-
45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014                                                                          15


   submit a launch request for coordination per paragraph 3.4 when an achievable launch date is
   determined. (Note: a “Planning” date is not an “Approved” launch date. It does not appear
   on the ER 90 Day Range Forecast, and can be “bumped” by any required operation
   associated with an “Approved” launch campaign to avoid a delay to the “Approved”
   program’s launch attempt). Also, to prevent a situation where the 45 SW Range Contractor
   would not have enough time to execute all the processes necessary to support a successful
   launch attempt, if a mission is still in “Planning” status at 90 days prior to the Target Launch
   Date (TLD), the 45 SW/CC has the authority to direct DOUS to change the mission status
   from “Planning” to “Indefinite” until the launch provider submits a revised, supportable
   launch date.
3.5. Associated/Related and Shadow Operations Scheduling. Any associated, related and/or
shadow operation which will run concurrently with a specified primary launch operation will not
be scheduled unless prior written approval is obtained from the appropriate 1 ROPS authority
and the primary launch program’s project office. It is the associated operation’s responsibility to
obtain approval directly from the launch customer project office. Range users desiring to
execute this type of operation must present written approval to the 1 ROPS/DOUF PSM allowing
sufficient time to coordinate and schedule the requirement.
   3.5.1. Associated/Related Operations Support. Associated/related operations are defined as
   any land, sea and/or air operation that is scheduled on a non-interference basis with a
   ballistic, space launch or aeronautical operation. The primary range user of the ballistic,
   space launch or aeronautical operation has no direct responsibility for the associated/related
   operation. If a launch anomaly occurs, the associated operation is responsible for controlling
   and submitting all requested data to the primary range user. It will be returned when the
   primary range user releases the data.
   3.5.2. Shadow Operations Support. Shadow operations are defined as operations of range
   equipment, typically (but not limited to) new equipment being developed by SMC/LLRV
   under SLRSC (or any other contract) prior to delivery to the 45 SW. It includes any activity
   to capture, record or distribute launch vehicle, payload or ground-based instrumentation data.
   Requests for shadow operations will be generally made by the government POC to the
   appropriate PSM. This request must include the purpose/objective of the related operation
   (or if it is stand-alone) and identify any potential impacts to the primary operation. The PSM
   will coordinate with all appropriate parties (launch agency, START Treaty Office, etc.) to
   determine if the shadow operation(s) will affect any prior agreements. Requests for
   related/shadow operations must be provided to the PSM NLT 45 days prior to the desired
   operation date or the suspense date stated in program’s UDS documents (whichever is
   earlier).
3.6. Major Pre-Launch Operations Scheduling. Requests for major pre-launch milestone
support which must be completed on a specific day or within a defined time frame, which if not
completed on time would cause a launch slip must be submitted to the DOUS Forecast
Scheduling Element prior to Shark Sheet generation or at least 30 calendar days in advance of
the requirement for a previously scheduled launch. This is necessary so that conflicting
operations that are less time critical can be moved without serious impact to other range users
and launch missions. Critical path milestones will receive priority over other activities as long as
this will not impact other approved launch dates. All major readiness pre-launch operations must
be included on the 45 SW Form 2050 or 2091. Other forecasted pre-launch operation requests
 16                                                              45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014


should be submitted no later than 1200 local time on Thursday two weeks prior to the planned
activities.
3.7. Maintenance Coordination. Any maintenance activity which may affect range systems
(including construction projects, facility improvements, range maintenance, major system
modifications, new equipment installations, utility support, etc.) will be coordinated through
DOUS in advance so that impacts can be assessed and mitigated as required. Critical range
system outages and/or failures expected as a result of planned maintenance activities must be
coordinated with DOUS well in advance of the project start date.
   3.7.1. Maintenance outages. Any maintenance request that will remove a part of an
   instrumentation system or a significant range resource from the schedule in excess of 24
   hours will be coordinated through the contractor’s scheduling section. Contractor Scheduling
   will then de-conflict and coordinate the request through DOUS for approval by 1 ROPS/CC.
   3.7.2. Maintenance resource de-confliction. When resources are available without conflict,
   the requirement for maintenance will be scheduled as requested. If a range user requests a
   resource scheduled for maintenance, DOUS will evaluate the situation and make a
   recommendation based on official directives and existing policies to optimize resource
   utilization. If the proposed recommendation is unacceptable to the parties, DOUS will
   elevate the issue to 1 ROPS/CC or DO for final resolution.
   3.7.3. Maintenance Priorities. Mission Essential corrective equipment maintenance will be
   conducted as required ensuring range systems remain Fully Mission Capable (FMC) at all
   times. Routine maintenance activities will not have priority over ongoing operations.
   3.7.4. Non Mission Capable (NMC) condition/outages. Any event which causes an
   instrumentation NMC condition or outage that causes a Required or Mandatory asset to be
   unable to perform its primary mission must be reported to 1 ROPS/DOUS as follows:

       3.7.4.1. When reporting NMC conditions and outages, the contractor will include an
       explanation or cause of the outage (if known) and an estimate to return the asset (ETRO)
       to FMC condition. During normal working hours, 1 ROPS/DOUS will forward the NMC
       information to the 45 SW Command Post for notification of 45 SW leadership. During
       1ROPS/DOUS non-working hours, the Contractor MCC Duty Representative will notify
       the 45 SW Command Post and the 1 ROPS Stand-by RSDO. The Command Post should
       also notify 45 RMS via e-mail at 45rmsre@patrick.af.mil.
3.8. Major Maintenance and Range Sustainment Scheduling. Planned maintenance and
major modifications involving range instrumentation systems which will prevent execution of
any or all launch missions for periods greater than 24 hours must be requested, coordinated and
scheduled well in advance of requirements. It is recommended that major system outage
requirements be submitted to DOUS for consideration at least 6 months in advance whenever
possible so that range and customer impacts can be assessed and viable contingency plans
formulated as necessary. All other routine maintenance and modification activities involving
range instrumentation systems will be scheduled with a specific call-up period (or a no call-up
period) regardless of the duration of the downtime. If a range user requests use of an
instrumentation system with a call-up period, maintenance will be deferred, and the system will
be returned to FMC status for resource utilization. An Estimated Time to Return to Operations
will be provided for each scheduled (and unscheduled) downtime.
   3.8.1. A process for scheduling modernization and sustainment efforts of Eastern Range
   instrumentation by approved organizations is prescribed. Modernization and sustainment
   activities include, but are not limited to analysis, demonstrations, both dry run and formal
   Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Installation/Integration Assembly Test and
   Checkout (IATC), range system down time, upgrades and Site Integration/Acceptance Tests.
   3.8.2. Scheduling requests to perform any modernization and sustainment activity will be
   submitted to the contractor through a Support Requirements Worksheet (SRW). Requests to
   perform Level III Formal Development Tests (dry run, DT&E, etc.) or Level IV Formal
   Operational Tests must include a Test Plan/Procedure detailing step-by-step actions on what
   is to be done at the time of testing and must be submitted no later than 10 days prior to the
   needed date.
   3.8.3. The contractor will evaluate the SRW documentation for instrumentation support
   adequacy and issue range instrumentation Operations Control Instructions (OCI) as
   necessary. The contractor will assign conflict-free SRW requests, an operations number and
   enter it into the ER instrumentation schedule database.
3.9. Operations Scrub. DOUS will be notified immediately when range users decide to scrub a
scheduled operation. If a scheduled operation is to be scrubbed or terminated by the range, the
ER and range user will jointly evaluate the circumstances involved and explore possible
alternative solutions prior to a decision. If an operation is in progress, the decision to scrub or
terminate will be jointly coordinated and agreed to between ER and the range user prior to any
announcement. The operation must be scrubbed by official actions as follows:
   3.9.1. Prior to pick up of range operation count, all requests for scrubs will be directed to
   DOUS.
 18                                                                45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014


   3.9.2. During a range operation or launch countdown, the RCO will be the official agent for
   accepting customer scrub requests. Upon notification of a scrub, the RCO will determine
   whether a customer will request a 24-hour or longer recycle. Prior to releasing any
   instrumentation, the RCO will forward the user’s request to the Range Operations
   Commander (ROC) who will coordinate with DOUS and wing leadership to determine if a
   24-hour or longer launch recycle is supportable. If 45 SW/CC approves a new launch date,
   the RCO will forward this information to DOUS before instrumentation release.
3.10. Rescheduling Action Following a Scrub. A reschedule date may be requested from
DOUS immediately following the scrub.
3.11. Range Turnaround Constraints. The minimum “turnaround time” from one launch
operation (measured from T-0 to T-0) to another (or one major operation to another) is (approx)
52 hours. This is due to instrumentation and contractor manpower constraints. Other factors that
must be considered by DOUS are the Set-up/Recycle/Configuration/Calibration/Crew Rest
periods, the time of day for the operation, extended minus or plus counts, contractor consecutive
workday limits, etc. All these factors (and more) must be considered prior to approving
customer requested launch dates or major milestone dates, especially when the requested dates
impact another user’s already approved launch or major milestone operation(s).

                         RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES

4.1. Range Responsibilities. 1 ROPS/DOUS serves as the primary interface for launch
customers concerning range scheduling for their launch programs. The range is required to
maintain an executable launch schedule as defined by AFSPCI 10-1213, Spacelift Strategies and
Scheduling Procedures.
4.2. Customer Scheduling Responsibilities. New scheduling representatives are highly
encouraged to meet with DOUS prior to scheduling operations for an orientation into the range
scheduling process. The Range Scheduling Flight can provide valuable scheduling information
and insight. The following sections describe standard scheduling procedures.
   4.2.1. Long Range Launch Forecasts. Range users will submit updated launch forecasts to
   DOUS when requested to support CLSRB meetings. Forecasted activities will be classified
   IAW individual Program Security Classification Guides. The forecast will also include
   information applicable to each operation such as:
       4.2.1.1. Operation Number, if assigned.
       4.2.1.2. Month, date and time of test to be conducted.
       4.2.1.3. Program Job Order Number.
       4.2.1.4. Vehicle Type.
       4.2.1.5. OD number.
       4.2.1.6. Launch Site.
       4.2.1.7. Mobile sensor requirements.
       4.2.1.8. Impact area(s).
   4.2.2. Weekly Schedule Requests. The Weekly Schedule is a listing of firm user range
   support requirements (launch and pre-launch activities) for the next week. User requirements
   should be submitted to DOUS by e-mail and recorded on 45 SW Form 2091 (Operations
   Schedule/Forecast Request Card) no later than 1200L on Thursday two weeks prior to the
   required date. Finalized schedules are normally published on the last working day of the
   week for the following week. Each schedule request will include the following information:
       4.2.2.1. Date and time test is desired.
       4.2.2.2. OD number and deletions or additions.
       4.2.2.3. Job Order Number.
       4.2.2.4. Location (building, area or launch site).
       4.2.2.5. Identity of the range user, test conductor and individual contact telephone
       numbers for pre-coordination and in-progress operations, as well as for emergency
       purposes (e.g. halt operations).
       4.2.2.6. Associated operation number.
 20                                                               45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014


       4.2.2.7. In case of pre-launch support operations, define resource/items required if
       greater or less than already specified in the OD.
       4.2.2.8. A minimum of 24-hours advance notification is required for operations requiring
       airspace coordination, civil engineering or CCAFS Skid Strip landing operations.
4.3. OD Scheduling Policies. When operations are scheduled, all support listed in the OD will
be committed to the operation, except those resources deleted by the customer (for user
requirements) or deleted by mutual agreement. Any agency requiring instrumentation or
facilities not listed in the OD must contact the PSM for determination and approval before
resources can be committed. DOUS will coordinate with appropriate 45 SW agencies, contractor
offices and support ranges when determining range resources availability in cases where new
requirements are added. If support can be provided and adequate coordination has been
accomplished, requested resources will be scheduled. This will constitute a range commitment
and authorize supporting agencies to issue necessary instructions.
   4.3.1. All operations requiring “RF Silence” will be scheduled IAW OD 10040.
   4.3.2. Requirements for support from non-ER resources not included in the OD, (e.g.
   helicopters, weather aircraft, ships, off-range resources, WR, NASA instrumentation sites,
   Kwajalein Missile Range, etc.) must be submitted as far in advance as possible and NLT 30
   calendar days prior to the requested support date (first use). 45 SW helicopter support will
   be scheduled IAW 45 SWI 13-204, Scheduling and Use of Helicopters for Eastern Range
   Support.
   4.3.3. Services and resources not include in the OR/OD (not provided by SCLS) must also
   be coordinated through the AF Launch Integration Office (AFLIO) at 476-4046, DSN 233:
       4.3.3.1. SCLS-LCC at (321) 853-8228, DSN 467.
       4.3.3.2. IOMS at (321) 853-7846, DSN 467.
4.4. Internal ER Test Scheduling. All internal range tests are scheduled through the
contractor’s scheduling office. Internal testing includes, but is not limited to preventive
maintenance, system modifications, hardware engineering/software development, system
degrades and system outages. The contractor scheduler coordinates requested assets with all
support agencies prior to submitting requests to DOUS for approval. DOUS will process and
integrate all range activities into the overall schedule as required to accomplish the mission.
4.5. Launch and Hazardous Operation Safety Notifications. DOUS is responsible for
providing hazardous operations notifications by official messages to the appropriate agencies.
Mandatory safety notifications involving land, national and international air and sea space are
sent to the responsible agencies which then publish and distribute NOTAMS by the FAA and
NOTMARS by the U.S. Coast Guard for the general public’s safety, awareness and required
action(s).
4.6. Other Range User Responsibilities. Range users shall:
   4.6.1. Provide representation at weekly DOUS meetings.
   4.6.2. Notify DOUS when scheduled base support activities (maintenance or modification to
   power, roads, water, etc.) could potentially impact unscheduled/scheduled launch processing.
45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014                                                                     21


  4.6.3. Notify DOUS of the status of operations on the current and long range forecast as
  soon as changes occur.
  4.6.4. Contact DOUS to relinquish unattainable launch dates as soon as information becomes
  available that indicates an approved launch date cannot be met.
  4.6.5. At the time of submission, range users must identify those operations that are weather
  sensitive or hazardous. Conflicts for resources or services that cannot be resolved by the
  contractor will be channeled to DOUS for prioritization and resolution.
  4.6.6. Requests for deviations from the approved schedule or support document should reach
  DOUS no later than 1200L on the day preceding the requested support date. Requests for
  changes to launch support requirements should reach DOUS on the day preceding the
  scheduled F-1 day support. If the ER cannot support the deviation as requested, the user will
  be required to take the following action:
     4.6.6.1. Withdraw the deviation and run the operation as initially requested.
     4.6.6.2. Reschedule the operation to a later date so proper coordination with all agencies
     can be accomplished.
  4.6.7. Scheduling requests submitted for an operation that is to run the following work day
  must be confirmed through positive contact with DOUS Real-time Scheduling via telephone
  to ensure the requested assets are available.
  4.6.8. Operation Completion Requirements. Customers are required to “close out” all
  scheduled operations NLT the scheduled completion time unless an extension has been
  requested and approved. In addition, customers will notify DOUS when operations are
  terminated or completed prior to the scheduled end time to prevent unnecessary program
  costs. The range user will immediately report completion, scrub or termination of all active
  operations to the on-console RCO. If there is no RCO support, or if the RCO is not at a
  console position, range users are required to notify DOUS when the operation concludes.
  Immediately upon test completion, the test conductor (or person in charge of the operation)
  must call 853-5941, regardless of whether the test was satisfactory or not. If problems were
  encountered during the operation, the range user will provide a brief, non-technical
  unclassified description. Users must also notify DOUS of any changes in post-operation data
  requirements after completing each test. During non-duty hours (2200-0600), range users
  will leave a recorded message on the DOUS answering machine at ext. 853-5941, fax (321)
  853-7338 or e-mail to 1ropschd@patrick.af.mil indicating the operation number,
  completion time and any problems encountered. Completed operations cannot be
  rescheduled using the same operations number.

                SCHEDULES AND OPERATIONAL STATUS REPORTS

5.1. Forecasts, Schedules, and Reports. The items listed below are prepared and distributed
by          DOUS. Agencies desiring specific or periodic forecasts, schedules or reports must
submit written requests (in advance) along with justification to DOUS. Non-DoD civilian
agencies requesting these items must have the military sponsor or contract monitoring officer
endorse the requirement before materials can be released.
   5.1.1. ER 90-Day Range Forecast. This document is constantly updated and maintained as
   scheduled operations and launch dates are approved. It is a dynamic 90-day forecast briefing
   slide of launch and major range instrumentation support operations scheduled on the ER.
   The 90-Day Range Forecast is located on the EMOCC website at:
   https://emocc.patrick.af.mil.
   5.1.2. Weekly Schedule Forecast. This schedule begins each Monday at 0001Z and ends on
   Sunday at 2359Z. It lists all operations scheduled on the ER and the instrumentation
   resources that have been allocated to support each operation. The schedule is published on
   Friday prior to the week of execution and is available on the EMOCC website.
5.2. Resource Utilization Summary. The ER Operations and Workload Summary (published
monthly) provides a quantitative measurement of range systems workload capacity and the
amount of work performed by the systems. This summary is generated from data that is
collected and processed by the Range Automatic Tasking System (RATS). Requests for this
document may be submitted in writing to DOUS.
45SWI13-206 5 JUNE 2014                                                                         23


                                            Chapter 6

                                  OPERATIONS SECURITY

6.1. Schedule Classification. Some programs impose specific security classification
requirements on activities associated with their programs. Since DOUS does not publish a
classified schedule, all classified range operations will only be referenced by the assigned
operation number and date and time until it is de-classified. The fact that an operation has been
completed does not mean that it has been de-classified. Post-operation security measures will
continue to be implemented in the same manner as used prior to the operation unless otherwise
directed by the range user, program official or the Security Classification Guide (SCG). Detailed
guidance regarding the classification of a program is available from the individual program’s
SCG. A summary of applicable security classification guidance is usually published in the
program’s OD.
   6.1.1. Daily and weekly schedules published by DOUS are Unclassified/FOUO, Not for
   Public Dissemination.
   6.1.2. Operation schedule requests will be submitted IAW the appropriate SCG and will be
   marked with the highest classification indicated in the SCG or other derivative information.
   Classified information on schedule request forms that have different levels of classification
   will be portion marked with the appropriate classification levels. Proper downgrading and
   declassification instructions will also be indicated on the scheduling request. Operation
   schedule request forms that are not properly marked will be refused by DOUS until proper
   markings have been applied.
   6.1.3. The Daily/Weekly Schedule Report, 90-Day Range Forecast and Major Ops Calendars
   contain information that must be protected IAW AFI 33-332 and DOD Regulation 5400.11;
   Privacy Act of 1974 as Amended 5 U.S.C. 552a, and are For Official Use Only (FOUO).
   Range users and aerospace contractors are responsible for safeguarding and maintaining
   scheduling products IAW the Privacy Act of 1974.
   6.1.4. 45 SW/PA, Public Affairs, is the office of record for DoD and NASA public releases
   that apply to 45 SW launch operations.
6.2. Operations Security (OPSEC) Practices. A great deal of operations information,
although unclassified, is considered “sensitive” and will be treated on a “need-to-know” basis.
Observations of general launch complex activities, correspondence, telephone calls and the
implementation of various activities related to the conduct of operations can all be indicators for
an impending operation. All personnel must be alert to the fact that sensitive unclassified
information, if freely discussed, can compromise classified information by compilation methods.
Information pertaining to any aspect of test operations will not be discussed with anyone except
those whose duties require the information. Such terms as “launch”, “firing operation”, or other
terms denoting an actual operation will be avoided when discussing any classified operation.
OPSEC was considered in the development of this document IAW AFI 10-701, Operations
Security.

                      AVAILABILITY OF SCHEDULING FORMS

7.1. Availability of Scheduling Forms. 45 SW scheduling forms can be obtained by accessing
the EMOCC webpage at https://emocc@patrick.af.mil. Note: 1 ROPS/DOUS requires an
original copy of each form submitted by range users. The scheduling office will provide
appropriate training on use of 45 SW scheduling forms upon request.
