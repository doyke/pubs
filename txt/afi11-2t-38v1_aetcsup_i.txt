 Note: For WSOs, fighter time is hours logged in aircraft assigned an AFSC of 12F3X or
 12F4X.

      1.2.3.1. Inexperienced Aircrew. Aircrew not designated as experienced will progress
      through a program managed by the flight commander to develop sound flying skills.
      Flight commanders will tailor each program based on the new aircrew’s performance in
      IQT and past flying experience. No time limit has been established to transition from
      inexperienced to experienced.
      1.2.3.2. CT Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise periodic CT meetings for
      aircrew members. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization and
      mission-related topics and to increase general knowledge. A cockpit and/or crew resource
      management (CRM) topic or scenario should be discussed in each CT meeting referring
      to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
      Program. Using MAJCOMs will detail CT meeting requirements in their MAJCOM
      supplement.
      1.2.3.2. (AETC) AETC units will conduct continuation training (CT) meetings at least
      quarterly. They will discuss instructional techniques and grading practices at each CT
      meeting. A cockpit/crew resource management (CRM) topic will be discussed at each
      formal quarterly CT meeting in accordance with AFI 11-290, Crew/Cockpit Resource
      Management Training Program. CRM topics are not required at informal CT meetings.
      Traditional reservists will attend quarterly CT meetings during their mandatory unit
      training assembly.

      to the maximum practical extent. Squadron operations officers, or higher, may authorize
      solo ID sorties on a case-by-case basis.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                             9


1.3. Training Concepts and Procedures:
   1.3.1. Unless specifically directed, the squadron commander will determine the level of
   supervision required to accomplish in-flight training. If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an instructor pilot (IP)
   may be required. If mission objectives require directed supervision, a squadron supervisor
   may be warranted.
   1.3.2. IPs and flight lead-qualified squadron supervisors may allow any pilot to lead limited
   portions of a mission if the pilot has been appropriately briefed. This provision will only be
   used to allow a pilot to practice events in which he or she is already qualified or to help
   determine if a pilot is ready for an upgrade program. In either case, the IP or squadron
   supervisor is responsible for the flight.
   1.3.3. Units will complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle except
   where specifically excepted. Using MAJCOMs will detail the training cycle in their
   MAJCOM supplement.
   1.3.4. (Added-AETC) There are two semiannual CT training cycles, 1 January to 30 June,
   1 July to 31 December of each calendar year.
   1.3.5. (Added-AETC) IFF training requirements are tracked on an annual basis.
1.4. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
   1.4.1. Maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations in accordance with
   (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2, and the RDS.
   1.4.2. Maintain formal course or equivalent training records for assigned and attached
   aircrew.
   1.4.3. Maintain documentation for each certification in the individual’s training records, or
   on an AF IMT 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF
   Aircrew Certifications.
   1.4.4. Prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives.
   1.4.5. Document training in ARMS, using the forms or IMTs specified in AFI 11-202,
   Volume 1.
   1.4.6. Track the following information for all aircrew, as applicable:
       1.4.6.1. Ground training dates accomplished and due.
       1.4.6.2. Flying hours by 30/60/90-day and cumulative totals.
       1.4.6.3. Event requirements and accomplishments by cumulative total and amount
       remaining for the training cycle.
       1.4.6.4. Sortie and event currencies and expiration dates.       Note: Units may specify
       additional training folder requirements.
1.5. Sortie Allocation Guidance. Units will use the following guidance to determine priority
for unit training sortie allocation:

at https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod.
1.7. Progress Reviews. Refer to the appropriate formal course syllabus or command directive
for progress review procedures.
1.8. Fuel Conservation. It is the responsibility of all aircrew to conserve fuel to the maximum
extent possible. Individual crew members and supervisors at all levels will manage aviation fuel
as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout
all phases of mission planning and execution. Once the objectives of training are complete,
sorties will be terminated at the earliest opportunity. Adherence to average sortie duration will
not be the driving factor of whether to land the aircraft or continue the mission.
1.9. Waivers. HQ AF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for training requirements established by
AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Except as specified elsewhere in this instruction the MAJCOM/A3 is
waiver authority for this instruction.
1.9. (AETC)Waivers. Units will submit waiver requests through the chain of command to HQ
AETC/A3FV.
   1.9.1. Request waivers through applicable stan/eval channels to MAJCOM/A3, (or
   equivalent). As applicable, MAJCOM/A3s will forward requests to HQ USAF/A3O-A, with
   an information copy to HQ USAF/A3O-AT.
   1.9.2. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and
   approved through higher level coordination authority.
1.10. (Added-AETC) Pilot Utilization Policy:
   1.10.1. (Added-AETC) Commanders will ensure wing pilots fill only authorized positions
   in accordance with unit manning documents (UMD) and pilot status is properly designated.
   The overall objective is for pilots to perform operations-related duties. Supervisors may
   assign pilots to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, flying evaluation board [FEB] member,
   mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved (level of pilot
   tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience).

                                            Chapter 2

                       INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. General. This chapter outlines the IQT program for the T-38. The primary method of
initial qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in
education and training course announcement (ETCA). Completing the appropriate formal course
satisfies basic qualification training requirements. When attendance is not practical or quotas are
not available, units will request waivers from the MAJCOM/A3 to conduct in-unit qualification
training, using formal school courseware.
   2.1.1. Upon completion of the IQT program, aircrew will be qualified IAW AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2, T-
   38 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
   2.1.2. Except in unusual circumstances, aircrew members undergoing IQT will receive
   ground and flight instruction with minimum interruption and complete training within the
   time specified by the syllabus. For formal training course IQT, failure to complete training
   within the specified time limit requires notifying the gaining wing commander of the
   aircrew’s name and grade, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
2.2. Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member must comply
with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites. In addition, all personnel maintaining
flying status will meet the physical examination; physiological training; and survival, evasion,
resistance, and escape (SERE) training requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, before flying.
2.3. Ground Training. Ground training will follow the formal course syllabus flow, but may
be tailored to local conditions and the individual’s background and experience. For in-unit
qualification training, commanders will obtain and use current formal school courseware, if
available.
2.4. Flying Training. Aircrew in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the
qualification evaluation unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM supplement. Formal
course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for IQT. Additional
training due to student nonprogression is available within the constraints of the formal course
syllabus. Pilots may satisfy MQT and upgrade training requirements during IQT if the
appropriate IP is available and the formal course training allows it.
2.5. Senior Officer Qualification. Comply with the guidance provided in AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   2.5.1. (Added-AETC) General officer flying training wing (FTW) commanders will be
   fully qualified IPs and have a completed AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification,
   according to the requirements of AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-202, Volume 2. The 19 AF/CC may
   be a fully qualified IP. If current and qualified, general officers in command billets may fly
   without an IP in their primary aircraft. Other general officers and those maintaining basic
   qualifications or less must fly with an IP.

3.1. General. MAJCOM will determine MQT requirements.
   3.1.1. (Added-AETC) MQT qualifies T-38 aircrew for Specialized Undergraduate Pilot
   Training (SUPT), ENJJPT, or IFF IP duty. (Exception: With 19 AF/DO approval, T-38-
   qualified senior officers may complete a limited IFF MQT for direct support mission
   qualification (BMC). Refer to paragraph 3.7.) MQT is normally conducted in conjunction
   with IQT according to the formal course pilot instructor training (PIT), ENJJPT PIT, or IFF
   upgrade instructor (UIP) syllabus. Additional sorties and requirements to become an MR
   PIT or IFF IP capable of instructing IPs in the upgrade instructor syllabus are at the
   discretion of the squadron commander.
   3.1.2. (Added-AETC) Pilots who have completed MQT are basic mission capable (BMC)
   according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and may not be designated as MR until completion of
   TI and certification by the squadron commander.
   3.1.3. (Added-AETC) Pilots must complete MQT within the training time prescribed in the
   formal course syllabus. The 19 AF/DO is the waiver authority for training time extensions.
   Units will document all waivers in the individual’s training folder. MQT is considered
   complete after successful completion of a mission evaluation in accordance with AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2 and AFI 11-2-T-38, Volume 2.
3.2. (Added-AETC) Prerequisite. Pilots must complete T-38 IQT prior to beginning MQT.
Before entering MQT, each aircrew member must comply with the prerequisites in the
appropriate formal course training syllabus and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

                                            Chapter 4

                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

4.1. General. This chapter outlines minimum ground and flying training requirements for T-38
aircrew CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of aircrew training in the basic flying
skills, which ensures safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mission-
related training required to accomplish the unit's assigned missions or taskings. Taskings may be
locally generated or higher headquarters directed. Using MAJCOMs will define additional
currencies and requirements in their MAJCOM supplement.
4.1. (AETC)GENERAL. The objectives of the CT program are to increase instructional skills,
enhance basic maneuver flying skills, and meet maneuver currency requirements. While
individual maneuver proficiency is very important, it does not ensure instructors continue to
develop their instructional skills and techniques. As such, the primary emphasis of the CT
program must be continuous instructor development as opposed to simple maneuver proficiency.
To that end, aircrews will manage aviation fuel as a limited and costly resource, and consider
fuel optimization throughout all phases of the CT program’s planning and execution. Units will
ensure ground operations (engine start time/taxi routing) and flight profiles are optimized for
efficient fuel usage. Units will only use CT flying hours to accomplish the requirements outlined
in this publication. CT sorties will be referred to as Instructor Development (ID) sorties. ID
sorties will not be used to ―   fill‖ a flying schedule or manage flying hour goals/programs.
Squadron commanders must manage the squadron’s flying hour program (FHP) to ensure all
aircrews are afforded ample opportunity to complete all required CT. One tool is the use of
squadron commander approved profiles during all ID sorties. Profiles will detail the minimum
events and/or currency maneuvers required to complete an effective ID sortie. ID sortie crews
and formations will be matched by experience as much as possible allowing more experienced
instructors the opportunity to mentor and develop less experienced instructors. Squadron
commanders may delegate management of the CT program no lower than the squadron
operations officer.
4.2. Ground Training. Ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT may be credited
toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. AFI 11-202,
Volume 1, specifies ground training requirements. Using MAJCOMs may specify additional
ground training requirements in their MAJCOM supplement. Units will track ground training
requirements in ARMS.
4.2. (AETC)Ground Training. See Table 4.4 (Added).
4.3. Flying Training Currencies and Recurrency:
   4.3.1. Currency. Table 4.1 lists minimum currency requirements for T-38 aircrew. Using
   MAJCOMs may specify additional events or sortie currencies in their MAJCOM supplement.
   If an aircrew member loses a particular currency, he or she may not perform that sortie or
   event except to regain currency.
   4.3.1. (AETC) In addition to the minimum currency requirements in Table A2.1 of the
   basic AFI, all pilots will maintain currency requirements shown in Table A2.1, and
   sortie/event requirements shown in Table 4.5 and Table 4.6 (IFF only). Pilots may update
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                                  17


     any currency or log events during any type mission, including student instructional missions
     where the instructor demonstrates the maneuver for the student’s training.

 NOTES:
 1. See paragraph 4.3.3 of this instruction.
 2. Non current pilots will increase their weather minimum by one category. To regain currency,
 supervision level is a current and qualified instructor in the aircraft or element. If the instructor
 is in the aircraft, the instructor’s weather minimums may be used.
 3. Instrument approaches may be flown from either cockpit when simulating instrument
 meteorological conditions (IMC) with a qualified safety observer or during actual IMC.
 MAJCOMs determine limitations when instrument approach currency is expired.
 4. Rear cockpit (RCP) landings update both RCP landing currency and normal landing
 currency. FCP landing currency is good day or night.
 5. Accomplish night landings between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
 morning civil twilight. To regain RCP night landing currency, three night landings must be
 accomplished from the RCP and the FCP IP must be qualified (not necessarily current) in FCP
 and RCP night landings. See paragraph 4.3.2 of this instruction.

     4.3.2. Recurrency. Recurrency is required when an aircrew member does not meet a
     currency requirement in this instruction. Supervision level is a current and qualified
     instructor in the aircraft or element. Training identified as ―affects basic aircraft qualification
     (BAQ)‖ requires regression to an unqualified status until recurrency training is completed.
     Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, supervisory requirements pertaining to
     recurrency may be satisfied in the flight position that offers the best control of the mission, as
     determined by the squadron commander.

      instructor in the aircraft or element.
      4.3.3. Landing Recurrency. Landing currency is required to maintain BAQ. Loss of
      landing currency over 210 days (225 days experienced) requires requalification training IAW
      AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2. Loss of landing currency less than 210
      days (225 days experienced) requires the following action: (Note: Timing starts from last
      landing.)
           4.3.3.1. For 31 to 90 Days (46 to 90 Days Experienced). Accomplish at least three
           satisfactory landings with a landing-current IP.
           4.3.3.2. For 91 to 135 Days. Comply with the actions in paragraph 4.3.3.1 and complete
           an instructor-supervised EP and instrument review session (normal, emergency, and
           instrument procedures).
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                            19


       4.3.3.3. For 136 to 210 Days (to 225 days Experienced). Comply with the actions in

       an emergency procedures evaluation (EPE). Documentation of AF 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, is not required.
4.4. Special Categories:
   4.4.1. Instructor Event or Sortie Currency. If an instructor becomes noncurrent in an
   event or sortie not affecting basic aircraft qualification BAQ, instructor status may be
   retained, but he or she will not instruct in that event or sortie until the required currency is
   regained. Table 4.1 lists supervision required for recurrency training.
   4.4.2. Loss of Instructor Qualification and Requalification. An instructor will be
   unqualified for:
   4.4.2. (AETC) Loss of Instructor Qualification              and    Requalification. Refer to
   Attachment 2 and paragraph 4.4.2.4. in this supplement.
       4.4.2.1. Cause IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
       4.4.2.2. A failed flight evaluation. To regain instructor status, an instructor must
       successfully complete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
       4.4.2.3. A failed qualification or instrument written examination. To regain instructor
       status, an instructor must successfully re-accomplish the written examination.
       4.4.2.4. (Added-AETC) In addition to the requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
       paragraphs 4.4.2.4.1 (Added) through 4.4.2.4.4. (Added), provide a timeline criteria for
       requalifying instructors. Joint specialized undergraduate pilot training (JSUPT), Euro-
       NATO joint jet pilot training (ENJJPT), PIT, ENJJPT PIT, and IFF instructors who have
       not performed a student instructional sortie for:
          4.4.2.4.1. (Added-AETC) A period of up to 225 days will fly a minimum of 1 ID
          sortie with a current and qualified instructor (IFF IPs will fly a minimum of 1 DS
          sortie on an IFF student mission with a qualified instructor in the RCP) in order to
          update all expired currencies in accordance with Table A2.1. Also refer to paragraph
          4.3.3 and Attachment 2 of the basic AFI.
          4.4.2.4.2. (Added-AETC) A period of 226 days to 2 years may complete a locally
          generated upgrade at the discretion of the OG/CC. An individual upgrade recurrency
          program will be developed, taking into account the aircrew member’s previous
          experience and currency. Send a copy of the proposed training program to 19 AF/DO
          for approval. Highly experienced instructors will conduct the flying training. An
          instrument/qualification evaluation and an instructor flight evaluation will be
          completed for recertification.
          4.4.2.4.3. (Added-AETC) A period of 2 to 5 years must complete the appropriate
          requalification syllabus.
          4.4.2.4.4. (Added-AETC) A period of more than 5 years must complete the
          appropriate PIT syllabus.

   4.4.3. Demanding Sortie. MAJCOMs will list sorties or events requiring demanding sortie
   currency in their MAJCOM supplement. Aircrew who do not have demanding sortie or event
   currency will not participate in demanding sorties without the proper level of supervision as
   determined by the squadron commander.
   4.4.4. Flight Surgeon (FS). FSs will accomplish CT IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   4.4.4. (AETC) Flight surgeons will accomplish aircrew flight equipment and egress training
   annually according to AFI 11-301, Volume 1, as supplemented,
   4.4.5. Higher Headquarters API-8 Aircrew. For training other than that conducted in
   support of a formal inspection, higher headquarters personnel must coordinate with the
   supporting unit as follows:
      4.4.5.1. Aircrew will ensure appropriate ARMS data is maintained and provided IAW
      AFI 11-401.
      4.4.5.2. Units will review the qualifications and currencies of higher headquarters-
      assigned aircrew before authorizing them to fly. Units will evaluate the demands of each
      mission scenario and ensure higher headquarters-assigned aircrew ability and proficiency
      will not be exceeded.
      4.4.5.3. Aircrew will submit qualification and authorization documentation to the
      supporting squadron commander or operations officer prior to flying with that squadron.
   4.4.6. (Added-AETC) Buddy Instructor Pilot (BIP) Program. The BIP Program will be
   accomplished in accordance with Attachment 3 (Added).
   4.4.7. (Added-AETC) IFF Special Mission Training. IFF special mission training will be
   accomplished in accordance with Attachment 4 (Added).
4.5. Annual Training Requirements:
   4.5.1. MAJCOMs. Will determine minimum annual requirements. Sorties and events
   accomplished during MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in
   which they were accomplished. Before an aircrew member may fly in the new training cycle,
   the OG commander will determine if additional training is required. (Note: Additional
   training may be required, depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.)
   4.5.1. (AETC) Aircrew members will accomplish sortie and event requirements listed in
   Table 4.5 (Added) and Table 4.6 (Added) of this supplement, as applicable. If an aircrew
   member fails to maintain sortie or event requirements, the squadron commander will review
   the crewmember’s status to determine appropriate action in accordance with AFI 11-402,
   Aviation and Parachute Service, Aeronautical ratings and Badges. BMC aircrew members
   must complete a MAJCOM mission qualification course and a mission evaluation. Once
   qualified, the crewmember will maintain the same CT sortie and event requirements
   (excluding ID and student instructional sorties) as an instructor, based on the crewmember’s
   experience level. BAQ aircrew members maintain the basic currencies listed in the basic 11-
   2T-38, Vol 1 and Table 4.5 of this instruction (Added). The 19 AF/DO is the reviewing,
   additional training, and waiver authority for 19 AF FEs. The following additional sortie and
   event requirements apply in AETC:
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                       21


      4.5.1.1. (Added-AETC) Solo CT Sorties. JSUPT, ENJJPT, ENJJPT PIT, and PIT
      (including ENJJPT PIT) IP CT sorties should be flown dual to the maximum extent
      possible.
      4.5.1.2. (Added-AETC) Logging CT Sorties. Only one IP in the aircraft may log a ID
      sortie, but the other pilot may log events accomplished for currency if he or she shares
      the flying time.
EXCEPTION: An experienced IP flying with another experienced IP may dual-log instrument
and navigation sorties (including low level).
      4.5.1.3. (Added-AETC) Requirements to Log Events:
          4.5.1.3.1. (Added-AETC) Event requirements may be accomplished with student
          instructional training when the IP demonstrates the maneuver or event.
          EXCEPTION: Instrument approaches may be updated on undergraduate student
          sorties only when flown at night or in IMC.
          4.5.1.3.2. (Added-AETC) Traffic patterns and landings will be performed from the
          RCP. EXCEPTION: IFF and PIT IPs may accomplish event requirements from either
          cockpit.
          4.5.1.3.3. (Added-AETC) Formation takeoffs, interval takeoffs, and formation
          landings may be logged from the lead or wing position.

NOTES:
1. MR pilots and MR WSOs only. Credit AHC, ACBT, SA, Instrument, and LL Nav ID
sorties.
2. Not required for IFF BMC pilots that have a mission evaluation in air-to-ground sorties only.
3. Demonstrate SA events from the FCP.
4. Not required for IFF BMC pilots that have a mission evaluation in air-to-air sorties only.
5. Demonstrate a complete procedure (high or low altitude) from the IAF to landing or missed
approach.
6. Accomplish in the FCP with the HUD dimmed from view or in the RCP. May be logged
with any instrument approach.
7. May be logged with single-engine precision or non-precision approach.
8. May be accomplished in the simulator.
   4.5.2. Squadron Commanders. Will approve profiles for all required CT sorties. Profiles
   will detail the minimum events and currency items to be accomplished on the sortie (for
   example, aircraft handling characteristics [AHC] maneuvers, approaches, or emergency
   patterns and landings).
   4.5.3. Prorating Requirements. Squadron commanders:
       4.5.3.1. May prorate training requirements IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, at the end of the
       training cycle.
       4.5.3.2. Will prorate requirements only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training
       non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
       4.5.3.3. Will consider newly assigned or qualified pilots who achieve qualification after
       the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month.
4.6. Multiple Qualification Requirements. MAJCOMs will specify which sorties and events
flown in other aircraft may be used to satisfy T-38 sortie and event requirements in their
MAJCOM supplement.
4.6. (AETC)Multiple Mission Qualification Requirements. T-38 aircrew members with
multiple mission qualifications must meet all T-38 CT requirements. T-38 aircrew members
with multiple mission qualifications may credit sortie and event requirements from Table 4.5 and
4.6, i.e., HUD-off instrument approach logged on an IFF sortie counts towards the requirements
in Table 4.5.
4.7. Multiple Qualification Currencies. MAJCOMs will specify which sorties and events
flown in other aircraft may be used to satisfy T-38 currencies in their MAJCOM supplement.
4.7. (AETC)Multiple Qualification Currencies. Pilots will fly at least once each 45 days in
each aircraft they maintain qualification in. They will comply with all other currency
requirements for each aircraft.

4.8. (Added-AETC) Functional Check Flight (FCF) Pilots. Also refer to FCF pilot
requirements are listed in Table 4.5 (Added) of this supplement. If an FCF is flown dual, it may
be counted as an FCF flight for both pilots provided a proportionate number of test items are
accomplished by each pilot. If an FCF pilot fails to meet sortie requirements, see paragraph 4.5.1
of this supplement. NOTE: For further information about the FCF program, see paragraph 5.6
(Added) and Attachment 1 (Added).
4.9. (Added-AETC) Theater Indoctrination (TI) Training. TI is the beginning of the local
pilot upgrade process. It is during TI that skills learned during IQT and MQT are reinforced in
the local flying environment. New pilots will fly a local orientation mission prior to the specific
TI category missions. This local orientation mission will focus on local departure, military
operating area, recovery, and pattern operations. The mission should allow new unit pilots to
absorb as many of the local idiosyncrasies as possible before concentrating on required category
missions. The TI category missions should focus on training techniques, local constraints,
common student errors, and should use local routes and bases to the maximum extent possible.
   4.9.1. (Added-AETC) Pilots in TI will fly with assistant flight commanders and above,
   check pilots, or pilots designated by the squadron commander.
   4.9.2. (Added-AETC) Pilots will not perform instructor duties or the unit mission prior to
   completing TI.
   4.9.3. (Added-AETC) Record TI in the training folder.
   4.9.4. (Added-AETC) TI sorties will be logged as training support sorties and may meet
   CT requirements during the period in which they are flown. As a minimum, fly the
   following missions in table 4.7 (Added):
   4.9.5. (Added-AETC) Except for the local orientation sortie, these missions may be
   combined if all training objectives are met. TI sorties will include normal operations and
   emergency situations in the local area such as diversions, single runway operations, and
   emergency airfields.
   4.9.6. (Added-AETC) After successfully completing TI, the squadron commander certifies
   the new pilot as MR or BAQ, as applicable.
   4.9.7. (Added-AETC) PIT squadron commanders may tailor TI for previous MR IPs
   directly gained from JSUPT squadrons; however, at a minimum, a local familiarization sortie
   must be accomplished.
   4.9.8. (Added-AETC) Squadron commanders may tailor TI for FPs; however, at a
   minimum, a local familiarization sortie must be accomplished.
   4.9.9. (Added-AETC) Squadron commanders may waive TI for pilots that remain at the
   same base in which they completed MQT.

                                              Chapter 5

                            SPECIALIZED TRAINING PROGRAMS

5.1. Overview. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for special capabilities and
qualifications. These programs are intended to provide a basic starting point and may need to be
modified by the squadron commander, based on the unit’s requirements and the aircrew’s
previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. Unless governed by a formal
course syllabus, ground and device training for these programs will consist of unit-developed
academics and scenarios. Flight training will be conducted IAW a program approved by the
squadron commander. Using MAJCOMs may specify additional specialized training programs in
their MAJCOM supplement.
5.2. Instructor Upgrade. Follow a MAJCOM-approved formal course syllabus.
5.3. RCP Night Landing Qualification Training:
5.3. (AETC)RCP Night Landing Qualification. RCP night landing qualification consists of
spatial disorientation training and at least one RCP night sortie with a RCP night landing
qualified IP. Accomplish spatial disorientation training before the first night sortie.
   5.3.1. Spatial Disorientation (SD) Ground Training. SD ground training will consist of
   both an SD briefing and an SD training system demonstration that focus on prevention,
   recognition and recovery. SD briefing requirements are met by currency in the instrument
   refresher course. If an SD training system is not available, ground training may consist of a
   SD briefing only, but special emphasis on SD prevention, recognition and recovery must be
   made during the briefing.
   5.3.1. (AETC) The spatial disorientation training should be accomplished in the spatial
   disorientation demonstrator, if available.
      5.3.2. Flying Training. For initial qualification, an IP qualified in RCP night landings must
      occupy the FCP. The IP being night qualified will accomplish a minimum of three RCP
      landings. Night landings to gain or regain night landing qualification will be accomplished
      between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight.
      5.3.2. (AETC) The night qualification sortie will be an instrument or navigation sortie
      emphasizing spatial disorientation prevention, cockpit lighting, night instruments, local area
      and traffic pattern procedures, and visual references. Units may authorize additional training,
      as required.
5.4. Formation and/or Flight Lead Upgrade. Using MAJCOMs will publish formation and/or
flight lead training programs in their MAJCOM supplement. Completion of a formal course
syllabus may satisfy this requirement.
5.4. (AETC)Formation and/or Flight Lead Upgrade. Completion of a formal instructor
course syllabus qualifies pilots for flight lead duties.
5.5. Low Altitude Training Upgrade. Using MAJCOMs will publish low altitude upgrade
programs in their MAJCOM supplement. Completion of a formal course syllabus may satisfy
this requirement.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                            29


5.5. (AETC)Low Altitude Training Upgrade. Completion of a formal instructor pilot course
syllabus (PIT or UIP), or for IFF, specialized training, qualifies aircrew members for low altitude
training.
5.6. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Training. MAJCOMs will publish FCF pilot training
requirements in their MAJCOM supplements.
5.6. (AETC)FCF Pilot Training. Units will train and certify FCF pilots as follows:
   5.6.1. (Added-AETC) Prerequisites.
       5.6.1.1. (Added-AETC) FCF pilots will be IP qualified with a minimum of 750 total
       flying hours and 200 IP or FP hours in the T-38, or 650 total hours and 300 IP or FP
       hours in the T-38.
       5.6.1.2. (Added-AETC) FCF IPs must have at least 4 months of experience conducting
       T-38 FCFs. The FCF section chief will consider the number of FCFs actually flown
       before recommending FCF pilots for FCF IP status. FCF IPs will train new FCF pilots
       and administer FCF certification flights according to local unit training programs.
       5.6.1.3. (Added-AETC) Ground Training. Ground training will include a review of
       applicable technical orders and publications, including, as a minimum, AFI 21-101,
       Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management; TO 1-1-300; Technical Manual,
       Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance Operational Checks; 1T-38C-
       6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight Procedures Manual, USAF Series T-
       38C Aircraft; and local FCF procedures.
       5.6.1.4. (Added-AETC) Flying Training. Pilots will fly a representative sample of FCF
       profiles with FCF IP supervision. Upon completion of the training program, the FCF IP
       will complete an AF IMT 4287, Functional Check Flight Certification Record T-38
       Aircraft. Note: For further information about the FCF program, see (Added) Attachment
       1.

5.8. (Added-AETC) AETC T-38 Lead-In Training for T-6 and First Assignment
Instructor Pilots (FAIP):
   5.8.1. (Added-AETC) T-6 FAIPs are authorized T-38 familiarization training at home
   wings prior to attending IFF. This training will normally consist of 10 T-38 aircraft sorties
   and 2 simulators. Prior to flying the first aircraft sortie, T-6 FAIPs will complete an
   instructor-monitored systems review, workbook, or computer-based training, as determined
   locally; T-38 open- and closed-book tests; a boldface examination; T-38 egress training; and
   normal procedures and EP training in the simulator. Aircraft sortie emphasis should focus on
   transition, AHC, instrument, and formation categories.
   5.8.2. (Added-AETC) Conduct all training from the front seat and use a grade sheet
   appropriate to the familiarization category to document progress and potential problem areas
   for each sortie. Assign an overall grade of No Grade (NG) to each mission. A grade of
   Unsatisfactory (U) may be assigned if basic airmanship, safety, or flight discipline is
   determined to be dangerous.
   5.8.3. (Added-AETC) In addition to familiarization training sorties, sandbag sorties are
   authorized.
   5.8.4. (Added-AETC) Members will establish training records that will be hand-carried to
   IFF training units.
   5.8.5. (Added-AETC) The OG/CC may authorize additional aircraft or simulator sorties
   based on individual needs.
5.9. (Added-AETC) Night Formation Qualification:
   5.9.1. (Added-AETC) Only crewmembers qualified in night formation may fly in a
   formation between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
   twilight.
   5.9.2. (Added-AETC) RCP night landing qualification is a prerequisite.
   5.9.3. (Added-AETC) For initial night formation qualification, a night formation-qualified
   IP must be in the aircraft. Night formation training will emphasize night-lighting procedures,
   visual signals, formation approaches (lead and wing), and formation split-up. Units may
   authorize additional training, as required.
   5.9.4. (Added-AETC) Pilots will update their currency by flying a portion of the sortie on
   the wing between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
   twilight. If dual, both pilots may update currency. To regain currency, they will complete
   initial night formation qualification training.
5.10. (Added-AETC) Annual EP and CRM Training:
   5.10.1. (Added-AETC) All aircrew will maintain EP and CRM mission currency. The
   mission should be accomplished in the simulator. If no certified simulator instructor is
   available, a T-38 IP may administer the simulator. Instructors may take credit for an EP and
   CRM simulator when administering the simulator.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                        31


   5.10.2. (Added-AETC) Because of local emergency scenarios, a locally generated
   simulator EP and CRM instructor guide will be used when administering the simulator. The
   EP simulator mission will include the following as a minimum (paragraphs 5.11.2.1 (Added)
   through 5.11.2.5 (Added)):
      5.10.2.1. (Added-AETC) A cross-section of thrust deficient situations (for example, a
      low or abnormal thrust situation in the low altitude (500’ AGL) environment).
      5.10.2.2. (Added-AETC) Use of HUD-only, HDD-only, and standby instrument use.
      5.10.2.3. (Added-AETC) All BOLDFACE procedures. The instructor will also
      emphasize selected noncritical action emergencies.
      5.10.2.4. (Added-AETC) At least one CRM practice scenario using CRM core concepts
      from AFI 11-290.
      5.10.2.5. (Added-AETC) Applicable mishap lessons learned identified by MAJCOM,
      wing, or unit safety staffs.
      5.10.2.6. (Added-AETC) A reduced runway condition reading or hydroplaning
      stopping scenario.
      5.10.2.7. (Added-AETC) A scenario covering nosewheel steering characteristics above
      normal taxi speeds, and in emergency scenarios with directional control problems.
      5.10.2.8. (Added-AETC) One emergency procedure per phase of flight.
      5.10.2.9. (Added-AETC) A compounding emergency situation tying two aircraft
      emergencies closely together (for example, tire failure on takeoff leading to FOD and a
      compressor stall; bird strike leading to structural damage or canopy loss in flight;
      compressor stall leading to engine fire, etc.).
   5.10.3. (Added-AETC) Pilots and WSOs must attend an academic CRM refresher each
   calendar year. This training will be tracked in ARMS.
5.11. (Added-AETC) Graduate Break in Training (BIT) Flying:
   5.11.1. (Added-AETC) UFT and T-38C transition course graduates who will exceed 45
   days between class graduation and their follow-on flying training class start date are
   authorized to fly additional, dedicated, front cockpit (FCP) aircraft training sorties after
   graduation. These additional training sorties are mandatory for IFF-bound and fighter FTU-
   bound graduates to maintain landing currency. They are optional for all others. Missed
   sorties, including due to TDY or leave must be made up. Waiver authority is the student’s
   assigned base wing commander (i.e., not the TDY base) for all aircraft or simulator events.
   5.11.2. (Added-AETC) In addition to dedicated FCP sorties, extra ― sandbag‖ sorties and
   simulators are authorized and encouraged based on availability. These ―sandbag‖ sorties
   may be flown in either the FCP or RCP. Unlimited simulator sorties are authorized on a
   space-available basis.
   5.11.3. (Added-AETC) Document accomplishment of all events and forward along with
   the rest of the student’s training documentation.
   5.11.4. (Added-AETC) Boldface testing will be accomplished according to local directives
   to ensure a safe level of proficiency is maintained. MQF testing is not required.

  5.11.5. (Added-AETC) A ―
                         sortie‖ refers to any sortie, FCP or RCP, including dedicated or
  ―sandbag‖.
     5.11.5.1. (Added-AETC) A ―     FCP (type) sortie‖ refers to a dedicated sortie where the
     primary mission is proficiency for the BIT student, who is expected to fly hands-on for at
     least 50% of the time.
     5.11.5.2. (Added-AETC) FCP sorties may replace simulators, but a minimum of 1
     simulator every 30 days is required.
 5.11.6. (Added-AETC) For IFF/fighter FTU-bound graduates:
     5.11.6.1. (Added-AETC) SQ/CCs will ensure BIT events are managed and scheduled
     to provide maximum benefit. BIT students will be assigned to a rated flight commander,
     who will ensure all BIT events are documented. Grade sheets are required for dedicated
     FCP sorties and all required simulators.
     5.11.6.2. (Added-AETC) Specific emphasis will be placed on formation and instrument
     training.
     5.11.6.3. (Added-AETC) If a BIT student fails to meet graduate standards, the SQ/CC
     will focus training to correct deficiencies. If performance remains below standards, the
     OG/CC and wing commander should consider reassignment to a less demanding MWS.
     In no case should a student be sent to follow-on training if they lack the potential to
     complete the course.
     5.11.6.4. (Added-AETC) Pre-IFF-BIT sorties (FCP and ―      sandbag‖) may be flown with
     a UFT, PIT or IFF squadron. On dedicated FCP sorties, only missions and events
     previously introduced in UFT or the T-38C transition syllabus will be flown. On RCP
     ―sandbag‖ sorties, students will not fly hands-on during IFF-specific events. Individual
     maneuver grades will be graded against the UFT or T-38C transition course syllabus
     course training standards (CTS). The overall grade will be NG (no grade) or
     Unsatisfactory (U).
     5.11.6.5. (Added-AETC) Post-IFF BIT required sorties (Table 5.2) will be flown with
     the IFF squadron only. Syllabus-directed events that were unaccomplished during IFF
     may be flown, but proficiency is not required. New events will not be introduced.
     Individual tasks will be graded against the IFF syllabus. The overall grade will be NG
     (no grade).

earlier than 30 days prior to FTU start date unless to attend training enroute (TDY enroute).
In this case, SQ/CCs will tailor the BIT program for maximum benefit prior to departure.
Comply with any gaining FTU currency requirements.
        5.11.6.6. (Added-AETC) Aeronautical orders will reflect ASC IX, FAC 2. All training
        will be logged in accordance with AFI 11-401. Instructors may log events in accordance
        with paragraph 4.5.1.3 (Added).
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                           35


     5.11.6.7. (Added-AETC) For IFF graduates who will not exceed a 45-day break-in-
     training, additional sorties are not automatically authorized. However, wing commanders
     may authorize orientation sorties for these graduates in any wing aircraft in accordance
     with AFI 11-401 and its AETC supplement.
5.12. (Added-AETC) T-38 Stall/Sink Rate Awareness Training Program (JSUPT,
ENJPPT, ENJJPT PIT and PIT Only):
  5.12.1. (Added-AETC) T-38 Stall/Sink Training Mission. Conduct the T-38 stall/sink
  training mission according to Attachment 5 (Added). Only qualified stall pilots will conduct
  stall training.
     5.12.1.1. (Added-AETC) Stall Recognition and Recovery Currency. This currency
     will be updated on a dual sortie at least once every 180 days. In order to update currency,
     the pilot must fly a minimum of one full aft stick stall and a minimum of one turning and
     one landing attitude approach to stall. The stall/sink rate orientation flight given by a
     designated stall pilot updates this currency for both pilots.
     5.12.1.2. (Added-AETC) Stall Seminar. Qualified stall pilots will conduct an annual
     stall and sink rate seminar during the first quarter of each calendar year. Attendance is
     mandatory for all assigned T-38 pilots. If the crewmember misses the annual seminar, he
     or she will attend a makeup seminar given by a qualified stall pilot or review the
     materials used during the seminar (slide presentation and meeting minutes). Failure to
     complete the annual seminar prior to 31 March will result in a loss of stall currency.
     Crewmembers assigned to the unit after 31 March or attending IQT are exempt from this
     requirement.
     5.12.1.3. (Added-AETC) When Stall Currency Is Lost. A crewmember not current in
     stalls will not fly student instructional sorties or solo sorties. If currency is lost due to
     failure to attend the annual stall seminar, the crewmember must complete a stall seminar
     per para. 5.13.1.2.
     5.12.1.4. (Added-AETC) To Regain Stall Currency. Pilots must practice stall
     recognition and recovery on a dual CT sortie with a stall-current IP.
  5.12.2. (Added-AETC) Initial Stall/Sink Rate Awareness Training (JSUPT, ENJJPT,
  ENJJPT PIT and PIT Only):
     5.12.2.1. (Added-AETC) Each IP must fly a stall and sink rate orientation flight within
     8 to 14 months of PIT graduation. The IP will occupy the primary seat in which he or she
     instructs (RCP for JSUPT and ENJJPT; FCP for PIT).
     5.12.2.2. (Added-AETC) Document the completed stall/sink rate awareness mission in
     the individual’s training folder.
  5.12.3. (Added-AETC) Stall Pilot Qualification and Currency:
     5.12.3.1. (Added-AETC) Unit designated stall pilots will normally be stan/eval FEs. In
     special circumstances, squadron or operations group commanders may designate highly
     experienced T-38 IPs as stall IPs.
     5.12.3.2. (Added-AETC) Designated T-38 stall pilots will attend one stall seminar and
     fly three stall training sorties.

     5.12.3.3. (Added-AETC) A semiannual stall pilot CT meeting will be conducted to
     discuss demonstration standardization, ground briefing, seminar techniques, problems,
     policies, and training objectives.
     5.12.3.4. (Added-AETC) Stall pilots will fly a stall sortie once every 90 days to
     maintain currency. To regain currency, the stall pilot must conduct a stall sortie with a
     current stall pilot.
     5.12.3.5. (Added-AETC) Stall pilot training will be documented in the individual’s
     training folder and the letter of Xs. See Attachment 6 (Added) for a sample T-38 letter of
     Xs.

Terms
Demanding sortie— A sortie that tasks the aircrew to the extent that flying frequency and
continuity are most critical. Sorties and events requiring demanding sortie currency include
ACBT ((D)BFM, (D)ACM, (D)ACT), LOWAT (LOW ALT, LOW A/A), SAT, CAS, and BSA
(except level passes at or above 1000 feet). Depending on unit tasking, the SQ/CC may add
sorties and events to the demanding sortie list.
Nondemanding sortie— A sortie that provides the aircrew with the opportunity to regain basic
flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills unused during the nonflying period.
Authorized sorties and events flown for or on a nondemanding sortie include instruments, AHC,
formation, LLNAV at or above 1000 feet AGL, and level weapons deliveries at or above 1000
feet AGL.
Low Altitude Training (LOWAT)— A LOWAT event involves performing realistic, mission-
oriented low altitude operations. LOWAT events are divided into two categories, LOW ALT
 42                                               AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


and LOW A/A. This tactical training does not apply to traffic pattern operations or other basic
transitions through the low-altitude structure.
Low Altitude (LOW ALT)— An event defined by performing realistic, mission-oriented low
altitude operations while below 1000’ AGL. The event includes low altitude navigation and/or
tactical formation, air-to-surface attacks, and defensive maneuvering to avoid or negate surface-
to-air threats.
Low Air—to-Air (LOW A/A) — An event defined as performing realistic mission-oriented air-
to-air operations while below 5000’ AGL. The event includes skills necessary to search for an
aerial target while at low altitude (down to 500’ AGL) and then engage offensively or react
defensively.Aircraft handling characteristics (AHC)—Training for proficiency in utilization
and exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope, consistent with operational and safety constraints,
that includes (but is not limited to) high or maximum angle of attack maneuvering, energy
management, minimum time turns, maximum or optimum acceleration, deceleration techniques,
and confidence maneuvers (AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures).
Basic aircraft qualification (BAQ)—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
(AFI 11-202, Vol. 1)
Cockpit familiarization trainer—A training device in which the controls, switches, and
instruments do not have to respond to trainee inputs. Used for checklist use, normal procedures,
and emergency procedures.
Continuation training (CT)—The program that provides crew members with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification
level.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure the average aircrew member maintains a minimum level of
proficiency in a given event.
(Added) (AETC)Demanding sortie— A sortie that tasks the aircrew to the extent that flying
frequency and continuity are most critical. Sorties and events requiring demanding sortie
currency include ACBT ((D)BFM, (D)ACM, (D)ACT), LOWAT (LOW ALT, LOW A/A), SAT,
CAS, and BSA (except level passes at or above 1000 feet). Depending on unit tasking, the
SQ/CC may add sorties and events to the demanding sortie list.
Emergency procedures evaluation (EPE)—An evaluation of aircrew knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and noncritical emergency procedures (EP) conducted by a stan/eval
flight examiner orally or in a cockpit training device.
Experienced—Aircrew who meet the experience qualifications defined in MAJCOM
supplements (see inexperienced).
Flight lead—As designated on flight orders, the individual responsible for overall conduct of the
mission from preflight preparation and briefing to postflight debriefing, regardless of his or her
actual position within the formation. A certified four-ship flight lead may lead formations and
missions in excess of four aircraft unless restricted by the unit commander. A two-ship flight
lead may lead an element in a larger formation.
Formal course—Training courses listed in Air Force ETCA.
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                            43


Inexperienced—Aircrew who do not qualify as experienced or are not certified as such by the
squadron commander (see experienced).
Initial qualification—An aircrew member engaged in training needed to qualify for basic
aircrew duties in an assigned position for a specific aircraft, without regard for the unit's
operational mission.
Initial qualification training (IQT)—Training needed to qualify for basic aircrew duties in an
assigned position for a specific aircraft, without regard for the unit’s operational mission. This
training is the minimum requirement for BAQ.
(Added) (AETC)Low Altitude (LOW ALT)— An event defined by performing realistic,
mission-oriented low altitude operations while below 1000’ AGL. The event includes low
altitude navigation and/or tactical formation, air-to-surface attacks, and defensive maneuvering
to avoid or negate surface-to-air threats.
Low altitude training—Mission-oriented operations in the certified low-altitude block (500 feet
to 1,000 feet AGL).
(Added) (AETC)Low Altitude Training (LOWAT)— A LOWAT event involves performing
realistic, mission-oriented low altitude operations. LOWAT events are divided into two
categories, LOW ALT and LOW A/A. This tactical training does not apply to traffic pattern
operations or other basic transitions through the low-altitude structure.
Low—level navigation—Visual flight rules point-to-point navigation in the 500 to 5,000 feet
AGL altitude block.
Mission qualification—An aircrew member engaged in training to qualify in an assigned
aircrew position to perform a command or unit mission.
Night—The time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local time (AFI 11-202,
Volume 3).
Night landing—A landing conducted between the end of evening civil twilight and the
beginning of morning civil twilight.
Night sortie—A sortie in which either a takeoff or a landing and at least 50 percent of flight
duration is accomplish between the end of evening twilight and the beginning of morning civil
twilight.
(Added) (AETC)Nondemanding sortie— A sortie that provides the aircrew with the
opportunity to regain basic flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills unused
during the nonflying period. Authorized sorties and events flown for or on a nondemanding
sortie include instruments, AHC, formation, LLNAV at or above 1000 feet AGL, and level
weapons deliveries at or above 1000 feet AGL.
Office of primary responsibility (OPR)—The headquarters, agency, or activity having the
primary functional interest in and responsibility for a specific action, project, plan, program, or
problem.
Operational flight trainer—A training device that dynamically simulates flight characteristics.
Used for normal, emergency, and instrument procedures, to include safety of flight, warfighting
tasks, and skill integration training.

                    BUDDY INSTRUCTOR PILOT (BIP) PROGRAM

A4.1. (Added-AETC) Overview. The AETC BIP program formalizes and standardizes the
training a new IP accomplishes from PIT graduation to be designated "experienced." This
program applies to JSUPT and ENJJPT undergraduate flying training units.
A4.2. Program Administration:
   A4.2.1. (Added-AETC) Following MQT, each new IP will be assigned to a highly
   qualified BIP who will monitor the new IP's performance and provide guidance in all areas of
   job requirements until the new IP has instructed through each category of training. NOTE:
   Key wing personnel (wing commanders, wing vice commanders, OG/CCs, and OG/CVs) are
   exempt from this program.
   A4.2.2. (Added-AETC) SQ/CCs should tailor each individual's BIP program and provide
   additional training as required. Because of the different experiences of new IPs, two different
   BIP courses are available—long and short. SQ/CCs will designate which program each new
   IP will enter, based on the new IP’s PIT performance, MQT, and previous experience, as
   follows:
      A4.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) The BIP long program expands on the short program and is
      mandatory for FAIPs and recommended for individuals who have not instructed or have
      limited major weapon system (MWS) experience. Minimum training requirements for the
      BIP long program are prescribed in paragraphs A4.4 (Added) through paragraph A4.4.4
      (Added).
      A4.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) The BIP short program is for new IPs with previous
      instructor experience or extensive MWS experience. Minimum training requirements for
      the BIP short program are prescribed in paragraph A4.5 (Added) through paragraph
      A4.5.4 (Added).
A4.3. (Added-AETC) Squadron Responsibilities:
   A4.3.1. (Added-AETC) The SQ/CC will:
      A4.3.1.1. (Added-AETC) Set squadron BIP policies and guidance.
      A4.3.1.2. (Added-AETC) Brief new IPs on BIP policies and responsibilities before the
      new IP flies with students. NOTE: The squadron operations officer may conduct this
      briefing in the absence of the SQ/CC.
      A4.3.1.3. (Added-AETC) Review completed BIP documentation and certify that new
      IPs have completed the BIP program.
   A4.3.2. (Added-AETC) The squadron DO or ADO will:
      A4.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) Monitor all aspects of the BIP program.
      A4.3.2.2. (Added-AETC) Chair a monthly CT meeting for IPs in the BIP program. The
      regularly scheduled quarterly CT meeting fulfills the requirement for that month’s
      meeting.

       A4.3.2.3. (Added-AETC) Review completed BIP documentation prior to the SQ/CC’s
       review.
   A4.3.3. (Added-AETC) The flight commander will:
       A4.3.3.1. (Added-AETC) Supervise overall scheduling, training, and progress of the
       flight BIP program.
       A4.3.3.2. (Added-AETC) Recommend an individually tailored BIP training program to
       the SQ/CC, based on the new IP’s past performance and experience.
       A4.3.3.3. (Added-AETC) Brief each new IP on flight policies, techniques, grading
       practices, and other applicable topics before he or she conducts student training. Note:
       The assistant flight commander may conduct this briefing in the absence of the flight
       commander.
       A4.3.3.4. (Added-AETC) Fly at least one sortie with each new IP in the BIP program.
       Note: The assistant flight commander may fly this sortie in the absence of the flight
       commander.
       A4.3.3.5. (Added-AETC) Verify that new IPs have met all BIP requirements before
       sending documentation up the chain of command for review.
   A4.3.4. (Added-AETC) The flight training officer will:
       A4.3.4.1. (Added-AETC) Maintain all BIP documentation in a BIP folder and forward
       it to the squadron training officer for review at least once a month.
       A4.3.4.2. (Added-AETC) Inspect BIP documentation on new IPs who have completed
       the BIP program and forward the paperwork through the flight commander to the
       squadron DO.
       A4.3.4.3. (Added-AETC) Ensure the flight scheduler requests sorties required to meet
       BIP requirements.
A4.4. (Added-AETC) BIP Long Program. This program should last approximately 3 to 6
months (minimum of 3 months). New instructors will accomplish the training requirements listed
in paragraphs A4.4.1 (Added) through A4.4.4 (Added). Briefings accomplished during MQT
may be used to fulfill these requirements.
   A4.4.1. (Added-AETC) Ground Training. Ground training consists of the following:
       A4.4.1.1. (Added-AETC) Squadron policies briefing (before flying with students).
       A4.4.1.2. (Added-AETC) BIP briefing (before flying with students).
       A4.4.1.3. (Added-AETC) Instructor responsibilities briefing (before flying with
       students).
       A4.4.1.4. (Added-AETC) Commander review (CR) and commander awareness
       program (CAP) briefing.

     A4.4.1.20. (Added-AETC) Open-book course training standards (CTS) test (locally
     generated).
  A4.4.2. (Added-AETC) Flying Training. The flying training portion of the BIP program
  consists of BIP sorties and sponsor sorties, as follows:
     A4.4.2.1. (Added-AETC) BIP Sorties. BIP sorties are those flown by the buddy IP
     with the new IP. All BIP sorties will be flown with the assigned buddy IP, flight unit
     stan/eval monitor (USEM), or any supervisor (assistant flight commander or above) in
     the new IP's chain of command. The objective of these flights is to further develop the
     new IP's flying proficiency and instructional techniques. On each BIP sortie, the buddy IP
     will discuss instructional techniques, planning profiles, student progress, grading
     practices, local flying policies, common student errors, and possible pitfalls the new IP
     should avoid. The buddy IP will document these sorties in the new IP's BIP record. At
     least one BIP sortie will be flown in each of the following categories of training:
        A4.4.2.1.1. (Added-AETC) Contact/Transition.
        A4.4.2.1.2. (Added-AETC) Two-ship formation.
        A4.4.2.1.3. (Added-AETC) Four-ship formation.
        A4.4.2.1.4. (Added-AETC) Instrument and navigation. The program will include a
        cross-country mission consisting of at least four sorties and one remain overnight
        (RON) stop. Sorties will use airfields typically used for student cross-country
        missions or airfields that have unusual operational procedures or environments. The
        BIP cross-country sortie must be flown prior to the new IP flying a student cross-
        country and emphasize procedures and techniques for instrument cross-country
        training.
        A4.4.2.1.5. (Added-AETC) Low-level sortie. This sortie may be flown as one leg of
        the cross-country.

       A4.4.2.2. (Added-AETC) Sponsor Sorties. The BIP, flight USEM, or any supervisor
       (assistant flight commander or above) in the new IP's chain of command will fly sponsor
       sorties with the new IP's students to ensure they are being taught proper techniques. New
       IPs will fly a series of sorties (three contact/transition, two instruments/navigation, and
       three formation) with the same student, after which the BIP will fly with that student. The
       BIP will provide feedback to the new IP (within 2 workdays) on instructional techniques
       and grading practices. Document all sponsor sorties and debriefings in the new IP's BIP
       training record.
   A4.4.3. (Added-AETC) Initial Student Sorties. Before the new IP flies any pre-solo
   student sorties, he or she will complete a minimum of three sorties with a post-solo student
   (in any category of training). The buddy IP will document these sorties in the IP's BIP record.
   A4.4.4. (Added-AETC) Student Solo. Prior to the new IP soloing his or her first student,
   someone in the BIP chain of command will fly one of the last four sorties before the student's
   initial solo. This sortie will not be the last sortie prior to initial solo. The buddy IP will
   document this sortie in the IP's BIP record.
A4.5. (Added-AETC) BIP Short Program. The BIP short program lasts approximately 1 to 3
months and is designed for the new IP who has come from an MWS with previous instructor
experience. After MQT and before accomplishing any student sorties, the new IP will obtain a
briefing from the SQ/CC regarding his or her instructor responsibilities. During the briefing, the
SQ/CC will sign the new IP's letter of appointment and BIP track letter. (Note: In the SQ/CC’s
absence, the squadron DO will accomplish this brief.) Short program training will be
accomplished as follows:
   A4.5.1. (Added-AETC) Ground Training. New instructors will accomplish the ground
   training requirements listed in the BIP long program (paragraphs A4.4.1 (Added) through
   A4.4.1.20 (Added).
   A4.5.2. (Added-AETC) Flying Training. The flying training portion of the BIP program
   consists of BIP sorties and sponsor sorties, as follows:
       A4.5.2.1. (Added-AETC) BIP Sorties. BIP sorties are those flown by the buddy IP
       with the new IP. All BIP sorties will be flown with the assigned buddy IP, flight USEM,
       or any supervisor (assistant flight commander or above) in the new IP's chain of
       command. The objective of these flights is to further develop the new IP's flying
       proficiency and instructional techniques. At least one BIP sortie will be flown. It may be
       in any category of training (for example, contact/transition, instruments, formation, or
       navigation). On the BIP sortie, the buddy IP will discuss instructional techniques,
       planning profiles, student progress, grading practices, pitfalls the new IP should avoid,
       local flying policies, and common student errors. The buddy IP will documents all sorties
       and debriefings in the new IP's BIP record.
       A4.5.2.2. (Added-AETC) Sponsor Sorties. The buddy IP, flight USEM, or any
       supervisor (assistant flight commander or above) in the new IP's chain of command will
       fly sponsor sorties with the new IP's students to ensure they are being taught proper
       techniques. At least one sponsor sortie will be flown (in any category of training) after
       the student has had sufficient exposure to be influenced by the new IP's techniques. The
       buddy IP will document all sorties and debriefings in the new IP's BIP record.

     A5.5.3.5. (Added-AETC) Low-Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT). To conduct
     low-altitude operations safely, aircrew need to be knowledgeable of aircraft handling and
     performance characteristics, formation, and navigation in the low-altitude environment.
     This environment requires a well-supervised LASDT program, including initial
     certification and currency requirements. This program incrementally qualifies IFF
     crewmembers to conduct LOW ALT down to 500 feet AGL.
        A5.5.3.5.1. (Added-AETC) Entry into LASDT requires SQ/CC approval.
        Crewmembers that completed the T-38C/IFF Instructor Qualification syllabus are
        considered LOW ALT qualified.
        A5.5.3.5.2. (Added-AETC) LASDT will be scheduled and briefed as the primary
        portion of the mission. It will not be flown as an alternate mission. Instructors and
        flight leads must be aware of the added stress and task-loading associated with low-
        altitude operations. Training profiles will be developed to avoid over-tasking the
        upgrading crewmember, and upgrade sortie continuity should be emphasized.
        A5.5.3.5.3. (Added-AETC) Academic Training. The following academic outline is
        applicable to all LASDT. All academic training will be completed prior to flight
        training and briefing:
            A5.5.3.5.3.1. (Added-AETC) AHC. A discussion of aircraft performance as it
            applies to the low-altitude environment, to include control response (low and high
            speed, over-G potential, speed brake use); afterburner (fuel considerations,
            selection techniques); acceleration and deceleration; level turns, vertical
            maneuvering, climb, dive, and slice, recoveries, effects of gross weight, power
            settings, density altitude, G-loading, and bank angles; terrain avoidance (ridge
            crossings); terrain clearance v turning room, dangers inherent in overbanking

A5.6. (Added-AETC) G-Awareness Continuation Training. Units will develop a CT
program that provides feedback to pilots and imprints a proper L-1 AGSM so that it becomes an
integral part of pulling Gs.
   A5.6.1. (Added-AETC) The basis of this program is to give each FL, SQ supervisor, flight
   surgeon and, if available, aerospace physiologist the skills needed to evaluate a flight
   member's AVTR to ensure a proper AGSM is being performed. This program also makes
   assessment of the AGSM a normal debrief item after every flight. The assessment should be
   done as a normal part of AVTR assessment while reviewing other tactical portions of the
   mission.
   A5.6.2. (Added-AETC) Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's
   program:
       A5.6.2.1. (Added-AETC) When maneuvers above 5 Gs are anticipated on any
       particular flight, attention will be given to G-awareness during the flight briefing.
       A5.6.2.2. (Added-AETC) AGSM technique and assessment will be incorporated into
       the squadron CT program. Emphasis will be placed on briefing, debriefing, and assessing
       the L-1 AGSM using the AVTR in the debrief on a daily basis. FLs, IPs, SQ supervisors,
       and flight surgeons should become adept at assessing and teaching the correct AGSM.
       Academics will include a discussion of the limitations imposed on aircraft performance
       as a result of an ineffective AGSM.
       A5.6.2.3. (Added-AETC) The G-awareness exercise will be flown IAW the guidance
       in AFI 11-2T-38V3.
       A5.6.2.4. (Added-AETC) FLs will assess the AGSM effectiveness of flight members
       during mission debriefings. This assessment should not be limited to the G-awareness
       exercise. Evaluate the AGSM after the pilot has had the time to fatigue to get an accurate
       assessment of a pilot's AGSM during a tactically and G-demanding portion of flight.
   A5.6.3. (Added-AETC) IPs or SQ supervisors will identify pilots having poor AGSM
   technique or low G-tolerance to the Flt/CC or appropriate operations supervisor. The SQ/DO
   or appropriate operations supervisor will determine what action is required to improve the
   pilot's G-tolerance. The SQ/CC will determine if refresher training is required IAW AFI 11-
   404.

                        T-38 STALL/SINK TRAINING MISSION

A6.1. (Added-AETC) Objectives. The IP must exhibit a thorough knowledge of the
following:
   A6.1.1. (Added-AETC) Situations that could deteriorate into a stall or excessive sink rate
   condition, approach-to-stall recognition, and/or stall recovery procedures.
   A6.1.2. (Added-AETC) Aft stick stall characteristics.
   A6.1.3. (Added-AETC) Conditions        encountered     through   improper     stall   recovery
   procedures.
   A6.1.4. (Added-AETC) Appropriate cues to use in preventing stall and sink rate situations
   and appropriate actions for recovery.
   A6.1.5. (Added-AETC) Instructional techniques for conducting stall and sink rate
   orientation training (stall pilot only).
A6.2. (Added-AETC) Ground Training. The squadron stall IP will:
   A6.2.1. (Added-AETC) Discuss factors affecting stall and high sink rate recognition.
   A6.2.2. (Added-AETC) Discuss the relationship between lift, drag, and thrust required and
   why stall recovery procedures are the best chance for survival.
   A6.2.3. (Added-AETC) Brief the maneuvers to be accomplished in detail, purpose of each
   maneuver, and sequence in which each maneuver will be performed. The profile requires
   approximately 1,600 pounds of fuel.
A6.3. (Added-AETC) Flying Training. The demonstration will be flown in the following
sequence:
   A6.3.1. (Added-AETC) Aft Stick Stall Demonstration (Stall Pilot Demonstration):
      A6.3.1.1. (Added-AETC) This maneuver demonstrates the full buffet range as the
      aircraft transitions from no buffet to the fully developed stall. It also demonstrates that
      power alone will not reliably recover the aircraft and confirms the importance of relaxing
      back stick pressure to recover.
      A6.3.1.2. (Added-AETC) Enter the maneuver with gear down, and full or 60 percent
      flaps. Observe the buffet progression that follows. Initially, the buffet will be a high-
      frequency, low-intensity vibration (angle of attack [AOA] below .6). The maximum
      performance (recovery) buffet will be a high frequency with moderate intensity (AOA
      .65 to .75). The definite increase in buffet intensity will be a low-frequency, high-
      intensity "thumping" in the cockpit (AOA .8). A very high sink rate, heavy buffet, and
      high AOA (above 1.0) indicate an actual stalled condition.
      A6.3.1.3. (Added-AETC) Observe the wing rock tendencies, sink rate, airspeed,
      vertical velocity indicator (VVI), and slab position. Next, select full afterburner without
      releasing back stick pressure and note the increase in buffet and the illusion of recovery.
      If the bank angle exceeds 90 degrees or stabilizes over 60 degrees, discontinue the
64                                               AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


     demonstration and recover the aircraft. Following the demonstration, recover the aircraft
     by relaxing back stick pressure and allowing airspeed to increase.
  A6.3.2. (Added-AETC) Approach-to-Stall Recovery Practice (IP Flies). The purpose is
  to practice and review standard stall recovery procedures. Enter the maneuver with gear, full
  flaps, and normal final turn airspeed. Note the distinctive transition to the definite increase in
  buffet intensity, controlled use of rudder during recovery, and optimum buffet and AOA for
  recovery.
  A6.3.3. (Added-AETC) Stall and Sink Rate Recovery Demonstration. The stall IP will
  normally use the demonstrations in paragraph A6.3.4 (Added) through paragraph A6.3.9
  (Added) to simulate patterns resulting in rapidly stalled conditions. He or she will perform
  reaction recoveries involving aggressive aft stick application with delayed power response to
  MAX. This recovery will be performed 400 to 500 feet above the simulated ground altitude
  to simulate recognition of ground rush. Because recognition of excessive sink rate usually
  occurs at an AGL altitude of approximately 10 percent of VVI, 400 to 500 feet would
  approximate the amount of altitude available during a descent with a 4,000 to 5,000 feet per
  minute VVI. Following each demonstration, the stall pilot will repeat the setup and allow the
  IP to apply appropriate recovery procedures at the simulated ground rush altitude. Compare
  and validate the effectiveness of recovery techniques and the improved controllability,
  reduced altitude loss, and time taken to full recovery.
  A6.3.4. (Added-AETC) Inadvertent No-Flap. This maneuver demonstrates the hazards of
  improper configuration. The stall pilot will enter the maneuver with gear, zero-percent flaps,
  and normal final turn airspeed. Set normal final turn picture and apply normal back stick
  pressure to turn. At the early onset of buffet, relax back stick pressure and allow an increase
  in airspeed and sink rate. At the simulated ground rush altitude, perform the reaction
  recovery. Observe the rapid onset of sink rate and unpredictability of control response.
  Repeat the entry scenario. When reaching the simulated ground rush altitude, transfer aircraft
  control to the IP and direct him or her to perform the recovery simulated ground rush
  altitude. Compare and validate the effectiveness of the recovery procedures.
 A6.3.5. (Added-AETC) Diving Final Turn. This maneuver demonstrates the hazards of
 an overly aggressive pattern resulting from poor wind analysis, poor flight discipline, or both.
 The stall pilot will enter the maneuver with gear, 60 percent flaps, and normal final turn
 speed. Set final turn with more than 45 degrees of bank and establish an intentional high sink
 rate. Continue until the simulated ground rush altitude and then perform the reaction
 recovery. Observe the rapid onset of sink rate and the aggravated unpredictability of control
 response caused by the additional wing chamber generated by the flaps. Repeat the entry
 scenario and have the IP perform the recovery when the stall pilot initiates a reaction
 recovery at the simulated ground rush altitude. Compare and validate the effectiveness of the
 recovery procedures.
 A6.3.6. (Added-AETC) Slow at the Perch. This maneuver demonstrates the hazards of
 poor airspeed control before the perch. The stall pilot will enter the maneuver with gear, full
 flaps, and final approach airspeed. Begin a normal final turn with slow airspeed and correct
 by only releasing back stick pressure to maintain on speed AOA. Allow the sink to continue
 until the simulated ground rush altitude and perform the reaction recovery. Observe the rapid
 onset of sink rate and very aggravated control response resulting immediately in wing rock
AFI11-2T-38V1_AETCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                          65


  and stall condition. Repeat the entry scenario and have the IP perform the recovery when the
  stall pilot initiates a reaction recovery at the simulated ground rush altitude. Compare and
  validate the effectiveness of the recovery procedures.
  A6.3.7. (Added-AETC) Approach and Landing Stall Scenario. During the following
  demonstrations, the stall pilot will simulate the hazards of reactionary responses involving
  abrupt control inputs low to the ground and the effects of instructor complacency. This
  recovery will be performed at a prebriefed altitude simulating the ground. Following each
  demonstration, the stall pilot will repeat the setup and allow the IP the opportunity to
  intervene on his or her own to prevent a high sink rate from developing. Focus training on
  timely instructor intervention.
  A6.3.8. (Added-AETC) Duck Under. This maneuver demonstrates the hazards of sink
  rates from duck under glidepath corrections in visual or instrument approaches. The stall
  pilot will enter the maneuver with gear, full flaps, final approach speed, and normal glidepath
  (VVI). While flying an instrument glidepath, simulate a correction to a contact glidepath for
  a shorter touchdown point. At about 200 feet above the simulated ground rush altitude, lower
  the nose slightly and decrease power to maintain final approach speed. At about 100 feet
  above the simulated ground altitude, recognize the error and attempt to flare or go around,
  using the reaction recovery. A late decision to correct will result in simulated ground impact
  at a high sink rate or an improper attempt to hold the aircraft off the runway. Simulating a
  late transition past the visual descent point on a nonprecision approach would be an
  alternative demonstration. Repeat the entry scenario and allow the instructor to intervene to
  prevent a sink rate from developing. Focus training on timely instructor intervention.
  A6.3.9. (Added-AETC) High Flare. This maneuver demonstrates the hazards of flaring
  high during the landing phase when ground effect would mask the classic buffet feel. The
  stall pilot will enter the maneuver with gear, 60 percent flaps, approximately 200 knots
  indicated airspeed (KIAS), and approximately 90 percent revolutions per minute (rpm) and
  will establish a 20-degree wings-level, nose-high pitch attitude. As airspeed decreases
  through 140 KIAS, lower the nose to achieve an approximate landing attitude. Simulate a late
  decision to go around, using the reaction recovery that will result in ground impact or an
  improper attempt to hold the aircraft off the runway. Repeat the entry scenario and allow the
  instructor to intervene to prevent a sink rate from developing. Focus training on timely
  instructor intervention and the lack of noticeable buffet or a definite increase in buffet
  intensity presence.
