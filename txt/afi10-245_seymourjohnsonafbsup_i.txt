SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This document has changed significantly in format in order to mirror DoDI 2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism
Standards. This AFI changes from the 31 series, Security to the 10 series, Operations. Additionally, the
term antiterrorism is stressed in this document over the term force protection. It corrects administrative
errors, updates references, changes format and incorporates clarifications and changes from MAJCOMs
and field units. It adds Terrorist Consequence Management planning and Vulnerability Assessments
(VAs) as baseline program standards. Requires installation Antiterrorism Officers (ATOs) to be qualified
by attending an approved Level II course. Identifies basic ATO roles and responsibilities. Changes DoD
Threat Levels and Threat Analysis factors to reflect revised Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) terminol-
ogy. It also changes Threat Conditions (THREATCONs) to Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs) and
requires installations to implement all FPCON measures ordered from higher headquarters, unless granted
specific relief. Adds considerations for food and water security and mail handling procedures. An AT Plan
listing unit location, site-specific measures, and linked to a FPCON will be classified, as a minimum,
CONFIDENTIAL. Directs commanders to use the AFOSI local counterintelligence threat assessment as
the basis for AT planning. Requires AT Plans to include procedures for using counterintelligence defen-
sive programs locally. Requires installation Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs) for all FPCONs
and requires at least three RAMs per day. Defines the minimum key elements required in an AT Plan.
Requires installations establish detailed barrier plans. Requires reporting on AF Strategic Plan, Volume 2
Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) Performance Measures. Requires commanders to maintain les-
sons learned and AT/FP exercise documentation for at least one year. Changes requirement for personnel
to receive Level I AT Awareness Training. Changes requirement for area of responsibility (AOR) specific
updates for personnel traveling OCONUS. Requires all Level II courses to establish Personnel Data Sys-
tem (PDS) Code “AFI.” Requires MAJCOMs to conduct annual curriculum review of their Level II
courses. RAVEN graduates, prior to Jan 2001, are awarded AT Level II credit based on the curriculum in
place prior to the aforementioned date. RAVEN graduates after Jan 2001 are not authorized to perform
duties as ATOs or Level I instructors, due to additional training requirements listed in DoDI 2000.16,
Table 1.1, and this instruction. Establishes documentation procedures for USAF personnel who have com-
pleted Level II training offered by other Services. Changes curriculum requirements for AT Level II and
Level III Training. Requires VAs be classified in accordance with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency
(DTRA) VA Classification Guide. Requires local VAs be conducted annually, with the exception of the
year the installation receives a higher headquarters VA. Establishes criteria for determining which DoD
sites/facilities require VAs. Requires commanders to prioritize, track and report vulnerabilities identified
during VAs to the next general officer/flag officer or equivalent. Adds procedures for installations receiv-

                                      AIR FORCE AT PROGRAM

1.1. Air Force AT Program. The program seeks to deter or blunt terrorist acts against the US Air Force
by giving guidance on collecting and disseminating timely threat information, providing training to all AF
members, developing comprehensive plans to deter, and counter terrorist incidents, allocating funds and
personnel, and implementing AT measures.
    1.1.1. US Position on Terrorism. The US position on terrorism is to encourage all nations to band
    together and give no sanctuary to terrorists. National security decision directives and statements by
    the President and senior officials set forth this policy. This instruction implements DoDI 2000.16,
    DoD Antiterrorism Standards, and adds Air Force-specific standards.
       1.1.1.1. The US Government is opposed to domestic and international terrorism and is prepared to
       act unilaterally, or in concert with other nations, when necessary to counter terrorist acts.
       1.1.1.2. The US Government considers terrorism by any person or group to be a threat to US
       national security. It will resist the use of terrorism by any legal means. The US will take measures
       to protect its citizens, property, and interests when evidence exists that a state or any terrorist orga-
       nization is mounting a terrorist act against this country.
       1.1.1.3. The US Government will make no concessions to terrorists. Simultaneously, the US will
       use every available resource to gain the safe return of American citizens held hostage by terrorists.
       1.1.1.4. The US will act decisively against terrorists without surrendering basic freedoms or
       endangering democratic principles. The US will encourage other governments to take similar
       stands.
    1.1.2. AT Responsibility. AT is a command responsibility and must be thoroughly integrated into
    every unit mission. Commanders must continually review their AT posture to keep current with
    changing policies and threat levels. Risk management, based on current threat, is the key when deter-
    mining vulnerabilities and resource prioritization. Any threat or potential vulnerability with risk that
    cannot be controlled to an acceptable level must be forwarded to the next level in the chain of com-
    mand for resolution. AT also requires every individual's participation to maintain awareness, practice
    personal security measures and report suspicious activity.
    1.1.2. (ACC) Consider designating the week of 11 September as FP awareness week, which would
    include AT exercises, FP equipment demonstrations, threat briefings, and public affairs activities.
    Emphasize individual member responsibilities in supporting the base AT program, including threat
    reporting procedures for the AFOSI Talon program.
    1.1.3. Countering the Threat. Countering the terrorist threat requires a fully integrated and coordi-
    nated AT approach with a number of key areas that include at a minimum: Civil Engineers (readiness
    and security engineering), NBC Defense, EOD, Fire Protection, Services (food), Public Affairs, Com-
    munications, Intelligence, Operations, Security Forces, Surgeon General, Judge Advocate, Comptrol-
    ler and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).
    1.1.4. DoD Policy. DoDD 2000.12, DoD Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) Program, estab-
    lishes the DoD policies and responsibilities for the implementation of the DoD combating terrorism
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                          7


  program. It establishes DoDI 2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism Standards, and DoD O-2000.12-H, Protec-
  tion of DoD Personnel and Activities Against Acts of Terrorism and Political Turbulence.

                      DOD AND AIR FORCE ESTABLISHED STANDARDS

2.1. DoD and Air Force Established Standards. The following AT standards incorporate the DoD
standards from DoDI 2000.16 and provide Air Force specific guidance. Air Force implementation of the
DoD standards is contained in the subparagraphs following the DoD standards.
    2.1.1. DoD Standard 1 - DoD AT Policy. Combatant Commanders, Chiefs of Service, and Directors
    of DoD Agencies and Field Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as "CINC and/or Services
    and/or DoD Agencies") are responsible for implementation of DoD AT policies within their organiza-
    tions.
       2.1.1.1. AF Deputy Chief of Staff, Air & Space Operations (AF/XO), is the OPR for Air Force AT
       matters and policy. AF/XO will approve all Air Force-wide AT programs.
           2.1.1.1.1. The AF/XO chairs the FP Summit. The Force Protection (FP) Summit, serves as the

           ments/understandings, latest vulnerability assessment and mitigation efforts and any other
           issues affecting the AT/FP program. Attendees are limited to 4 FW/CC/CV, 916th ARW/
           CC, Group Commanders, SFS, ATO, and others which may be invited due to expertise by
           the ATO or Chairman.
           2.1.1.14.2.2. (Added-ACC) The ACC FPWG is a semiannual division-level meeting
           chaired by SF. This group oversees the ACC FP Action Groups, formulates policy, identi-
           fies AT/FP shortfalls, and makes recommendations to the FPEC. The FPWG may report to
           other ACC decision-making bodies with a comparable level of leadership oversight.
           2.1.1.14.2.3. (Added-ACC) ACC FP Action Groups work to resolve command AT/FP
           shortfalls and report recommendations to the FPWG chairman. Each action group chair-
           man will maintain a current charter, which must be coordinated among the member direc-
           torates, and ultimately approved by the FPWG Chairman.
              2.1.1.14.2.3.1. (Added-ACC) The ACC TWG is chaired by AFOSI and consists of
              representatives from CE, DO, IN, SF, and SG. The TWG meets regularly to evaluate

              OSI, CS, Family Support, 916 ARW ATO, Services, OG, OPSEC, LRS and ATO. The
              TWG meets weekly in the MSG Conference Room or as directed by the Chairman.
              Any member of the TWG can call for an immediate forming of the group if that person
              deems there is a threat against the installation. The MSG/CCS maintains the TWG
              recall roster and e-mail group.
              2.1.1.14.2.3.2. (Added-ACC) The ACC VAG is chaired by a CE representative with
              members from SF, XP, FM, SC, and SG. The VAG is responsible for creating a viable
              antiterrorism funding methodology and utilizes the Vulnerability Assessment Manage-
              ment Program (VAMP) to prioritize the command's vulnerability integrated priority list
              (IPL). The VAG will provide its recommendation to the FPWG Chairman on funds
              distribution for final approval.
              2.1.1.14.2.3.2. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Threat Working Group (TWG) members
              will comprise the Vulnerability Action Group (VAG). The VAG meets immediately
              after the TWG the first week of the month. Members will review steps taken to miti-
              gate/close vulnerabilities and the group approves these actions/recommendations.
              Once the item is recommended for closure by the VAG, the ATO will forward to the 4
              FW/CC for formal closure. Usually closure is accomplished using VAMP.
              2.1.1.14.2.3.3. (Added-ACC) The ACC RAG is chaired by a DR representative with
              members from AC2ISR, SV, LG, SG, FM, IN, SC, SF, and XP. The RAG evaluates AT/
              FP technologies and programs for use within ACC and advocates funding to pursue
              implementation through the FPWG.
    2.1.1.15. Commanders at all echelons shall develop full working knowledge of AT policies and
    standards and take appropriate measures to protect DoD personnel to reduce the vulnerability of

2.2. DoD Standard 2 - Development of AT Standards. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD Agencies
shall develop and implement a comprehensive AT program under their respective control to comply with
all the standards contained in DoDI 2000.16. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD Agencies shall use stan-
dards contained in DoDI 2000.16 as baseline standards. CINCs and/or Services and/or Agencies may pro-
mulgate unique requirements in their implementing directives to supplement the standards contained
herein.
     2.2.1. As a minimum, AF standards shall address the areas listed in DoDI 2000.16 and this instruction
     to include:
        2.2.1.1. Procedures to collect, analyze and disseminate terrorist threat information, threat capabil-
        ities and vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. This is a joint responsibility of CINCs and/or Services
        and/or Agencies, and the intelligence community.
        2.2.1.2. Terrorism Threat Assessment, Vulnerability Assessments, Terrorist Incident Response
        Measures and Terrorist Consequence Management Measures.
        2.2.1.3. AT plans and procedures to enhance AT protection.
        2.2.1.4. Procedures to identify AT requirements and program for resources necessary to meet
        security requirements.
            2.2.1.4.1. AT Funding. There are two methods for obtaining AT funding. The first method is
            through the normal Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process. The Deputy Assistant
            Secretary of the Air Force (Budget) (SAF/FMB) includes approved AT budget requests in
            budget submissions and tracks program execution. SAF/FMB also provides policy and guid-
            ance on legal budget limitations and obligation criteria. Installations may use the template at
            attachment 8 for their POM submissions.
            2.2.1.4.1. (ACC) HQ ACC/SFX will coordinate with NAF FP Cells to gather AT Program
            Objective Memorandum requirements for ACC bases.
            2.2.1.4.2. A second method of obtaining AT funding is through the Chairman of the Joint
            Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund (CbTRIF). Unlike
            POM submissions, CbTRIFs are to fund emergent high-priority combating terrorism require-
            ments in the year of execution. CbTRIFs are not intended to replace the POM process or sub-
            sidize ongoing projects. They also do not supplement budget shortfalls or support routine
            activity that is normally a Service responsibility. Units may refer to Chairman of the Joint
            Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5261.01, Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund
            for specific guidance/fund submission process.
            2.2.1.4.2. (ACC) Unless otherwise specified by HQ ACC/SFOF, ACC installations will for-
            ward Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund (CbT RIF) requests to NAF FP Cells
            twice annually; 1 January and 1 July. NAFs will review, edit, and send to HQ ACC/SFOF by
            15 January and 15 July, respectively.
                2.2.1.4.2.1. Air Force commands serving as components of combatant commands shall
                coordinate their requests IAW CbTRIF program guidelines. In addition, MAJCOMs shall
                provide a copy of their requests to SAF/FMBO and AF/XOFP, when they submit their
                request to the CINC. Once a submission is initially processed by the Joint Staff (J34), it
                shall be sent to the appropriate offices (Air Staff functionals) for coordination. SAF/FMBO
                will coordinate on requests and annotate whether or not Air Force funds are available.

              2.2.1.4.2.1. (ACC) The ACC VAG will review, edit, and prioritize ACC CbT RIF pack-
              ages for submittal by ACC to the appropriate combatant commanders.
              2.2.1.4.2.2. (Added-ACC) The ACC VAG will monitor the AT expenditures of ACC
              installations and recommend up to three installation AT program funding audits per year to
              the ACC FPWG chairperson. Audits will include all installation AT expenditures for the
              previous 3 years, including utilization rates of purchased equipment. If approved, audits
              will be conducted jointly by HQ ACC/FMAS and HQ ACC/SFXP, who will report find-
              ings to the FPWG chairperson.
              2.2.1.4.2.2. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The 4 FW/ATO will monitor the AT expenditures.
              Any unit which receives funds for Homeland Security, Antiterrorism, (global war on ter-
              rorism, homeland defense, etc.) or any other types related to improving security or conse-
              quence management for the installation will forward the notification to the ATO so it may
              be tracked wing wide. This also applies to Tenants.
       2.2.1.5. Construction considerations. All facilities shall comply with the DoD Antiterrorism Con-
       struction Standards.

2.3. DoD Standard 3 - Assignment of AT Operational Responsibility. When AT responsibilities for
the CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD Agencies conflict or overlap, and are not otherwise governed by
law, a specific DoD policy or an appropriate memorandum of agreement, the geographic CINC’s force
protection policies will take precedence over all force protection policies or programs of any DoD compo-
nent deployed in that command’s area of responsibility (AOR) and not otherwise under the security
responsibility of the Department of State (DoS). Commanders at all levels shall take appropriate measures
to protect DoD personnel, families, facilities, material and reduce the vulnerability to terrorist use of
WMD.
   2.3.1. MAJCOMs, Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) and installation
   commanders shall identify AT specific operational responsibilities in their supplement to this instruc-
   tion. Responsibilities shall include the scope of AT programs for facilities and operations that do not
   meet the legal definition of an installation (i.e., Recruiting Offices, Red Horse at Korea, ROTC and
   other Geographic Separated Units).
   2.3.1. (ACC) Geographically separated units (GSU) attached to an installation will comply and be
   included in the respective AT plan. Stand-alone GSUs will develop and maintain a viable AT program
   IAW with AFI 10-245 as supplemented.
   2.3.1. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The 23 FG will follow the program requirements as directed by Pope
   AFB.
   2.3.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and installation commanders shall ensure action to combat terrorism
   outside the United States comply with lead CINC, Service, or Agency guidance. MAJCOMs, FOAs,
   DRUs and installation commanders will also ensure such actions comply with applicable status of
   forces agreements (SOFA), the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide and MOUs.
   2.3.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and installation commanders shall work with other Air Force orga-
   nizations, US Service branches and DoD agencies to reduce vulnerability to terrorism. MAJCOMs
   FOAs, DRUs and installation commanders shall establish an AT program tailored to the local mission,
   conditions, the terrorist threat and the national security environment.

     2.3.4. Installation commanders shall:
        2.3.4.1. Implement an AT program to combat the local terrorist threat and support the US Air
        Force AT program. This program shall identify tasked agencies, required actions and means of
        exercising and evaluating the program through annual operational and command post AT exer-
        cises. Commanders will document a review of their Installation AT Plan on an annual basis or
        within 60 days of assuming command.
        2.3.4.2. Establish an active public affairs program to combat terrorism. Public affairs personnel
        are the primary spokespersons for installation commanders. Public Affairs should help dispel
        rumors and misinformation by providing appropriate and timely information to the news media
        and base populace, according to current Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public
        Affairs and SAF/PA AT guidance. Public Affairs Officers shall stay current on the subject of ter-
        rorism to enhance their effectiveness in dealing with this issue. Ensure all terrorist incidents/threat
        reports to news media are coordinated with installation commanders and his/her Threat Working
        Group prior to official release.
        2.3.4.2. (ACC) Installation Public Affairs offices will work closely with the wing ATO to publish
        FP articles in the base newspaper to educate the base populace on base FP efforts and individual
        AT techniques.
        2.3.4.3. In coordination with AFOSI, provide assistance when directed or requested by the terror-
        ist incident lead agency. The lead agency for terrorist incidents outside the United States is the
        DoS. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is the lead agency for incidents within the United States.
        The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the lead agency for certain aviation incidents.
        2.3.4.4. Review, support, and implement DoD critical infrastructure protection requirements in
        accordance with DoD Directive 5160.54, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and AFPD
        10-24, Air Force Critical Infrastructure Protection.

2.4. DoD Standard 4 - AT Coordination in Overseas Locations. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD
Agencies in overseas locations shall coordinate their AT efforts with host nation authorities and the US
Embassy as appropriate. DoD Intelligence and Counterintelligence elements shall coordinate their activi-
ties in support of AT plans and programs through established DoD procedures.
     2.4.1. CINCs with geographic responsibilities shall coordinate AT matters with Chiefs of Mission
     (CoMs) in countries within their AOR, and with functional CINCs and DoD Agencies, whose person-
     nel are stationed in or transit the geographic CINC’s AOR.
     2.4.2. To ensure timely geographic CINC visibility of additional AT obligations, functional CINCs,
     and DoD Agencies, whose forces will station in or transit the AOR of a geographic CINC shall initiate
     coordination of AT matters with the geographic CINC.
     2.4.3. DoD elements not under the force protection responsibility of a geographic CINC, by law or
     under provisions of a CINC-CoM MOA, shall comply with the State Department's Overseas Security
     Policy Board (OSPB) Security Standards.
     2.4.4. The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), acting as DoD's executive agent for
     diplomatic security matters, shall, through the United States Defense Representative (USDR), ensure
     that non-CINC assigned DoD elements, whose AT responsibility rests with the CoM, comply with
     OSPB standards.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                   17


   2.4.5. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Combating Terrorism Policy and Sup-
   port (CTP&S), or designee, is DoD's designated representative for resolving disputes with DoS offi-
   cials, in countries where the MOU on Security of DoD Elements and Personnel in Foreign Areas is
   between the DoS and the DoD. CINCs concerned with DoS standards shall address them with the
   DASD through the Chairman of the Joint Staff.

2.5. DoD Standard 5 - Comprehensive AT Development, Implementation and Assessment. C o m -
manders at all levels shall develop and implement a comprehensive AT program for personnel under their
respective control designed to accomplish all the standards contained in this Instruction.
   2.5.1. AT Management. To develop and implement AT programs and plans, CINCs, Services, and/or
   DoD Agencies, shall designate a full-time staff officer in writing to supervise, inspect, exercise,
   review, assess and report on the AT program within the theater of command. At the theater level, com-
   ponent commanders provide the critical linkage from the CINC to the operating forces. Therefore,
   component commanders are responsible to provide direct AT/FP support to all forces, including tran-
   sit forces. This direct support should include threat and VAs of routes and sites used by transiting
   forces, intelligence support, and AT augmentation. In order to effectively implement the standards in
   DoDI 2000.16, component commanders shall maintain a full-time Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) and
   consider a full-time AT/FP staff.
       2.5.1.1. MAJCOM, FOA, DRU AT staff officers and installation ATOs shall be trained in AT pro-
       cedures as described in DoDI 2000.16 and DoD O-2000.12-H. Training will include attendance at
       a parent Level II Service-approved course (USAF approved courses are listed in Attachment 7).
       When possible, this training should be accomplished prior to assuming AT responsibilities.
   2.5.2. Another critical link to operating forces is logistics support. The logistics contracting process
   for support of operational forces shall incorporate considerations for AT measures during contracting
   requirement, award, execution, and the evaluation process when the effort to be contracted for could
   affect the security of operating forces, particularly in-transit forces. Geographic CINCs shall ensure
   that component commanders, in coordination with the relevant country team, verify that all logistics
   support contracts and agreements consider AT for a particular security environment. During the eval-
   uation process, future contract awards shall consider adequate AT performance.
   2.5.3. Elements of the Comprehensive AT Program Development, Implementation and Assessment.
   AT program elements include threat assessments, VAs, planning, exercises, program reviews and
   training. The process, or sequence, of AT program elements should be iterative and serve to continu-
   ously refine the AT Plan.
   2.5.4. AF Strategic Plan Performance Measures. Installations will report to MAJCOMs the status of
   their installation’s AT plans IAW with AF Strategic Plan, Volume 2, Performance Measure 2.A.12,
   Antiterrorism/Force Protection Program. (RCS: HAF-SFC(SA)0125, Status of Antiterrorism Plans
   Report) This report is designated emergency status code C-2. Continue reporting during emergency
   conditions.
       2.5.4.1. MAJCOMs will, in turn, report the status of their respective installations AT plan to HQ
       USAF/XOFP NLT 10 Oct and 10 Apr of each year. MAJCOMs will establish their own reporting
       suspenses for receiving installation information.

        tiveness, unit level support of base FPCON measures, and status of vulnerabilities.
        2.6.1.2. (Added-ACC) All stand-alone ACC units, ACC-gained AFRC units, and tenant units
        (other service or MAJCOM, DECA, DoDEA, AAFES, etc) shall appoint a primary and alternate
        Unit Antiterrorism Officer (UATO) (officer or NCO, E-5 or above, or civilian, GS-9 or above) in
        writing to the base ATO. The UATO will be the unit-level liaison with the base ATO on installa-
        tion AT issues. UATOs will attend AT Level II training whenever it is offered by a visiting Mobile
        Training Team at the installation.
        2.6.1.2. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Tenant units, along with AAFES, DECA, AF Audit Agency,
        training units not assigned under the 4 FW, will appoint a primary and alternate Antiterrorism
        Monitor (ATM) to establish a unit program and comply with the wing’s Antiterrorism program.
        Unit commanders should consult with the ATO before making appointments of anyone lower than
        E-5. Once appointed, the ATO will schedule training with new ATMs. All appointed ATMs should
        attend Level II Antiterrorism Force Protection training if available.
        2.6.1.3. (Added-ACC) ACC installations will forward a copy of their ATO appointment memo-
        randum to HQ ACC/SFOF, 220 Sweeney Blvd, Suite 112, Langley AFB VA 23665-2796. The

        SIPRNET email addresses, cell phone or pager number, and duty phone numbers.
     2.6.2. Commanders deploying with their units outside the United States (US) and its territories and
     possessions, will assign a primary and alternate ATO as the unit’s AT subject matter expert/advisor.
     The ATO shall ensure each person within the unit is aware of the terrorism threat, reporting proce-
     dures, and is trained to employ methods that reduce risk or mitigate the effects should an attack occur.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                               19


  2.6.2. (ACC) Each AEF rotation supported by an installation will have a primary and alternate ATO
  assigned and trained in AT Level II to advise the deploying commander on AT matters.
  2.6.2. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) During each AEF rotation where the wing is the lead unit, a primary
  and alternate ATO will be assigned. The primary must be trained in AT Level II to advise the deploy-
  ing commander on AT matters.
  2.6.3. Commanders shall ensure ATOs have access to the AT publications listed in Attachment 1.
  2.6.4. Installation ATOs shall:
     2.6.4.1. In addition to regularly scheduled FPWGs, meets with installation AFOSI, Security
     Forces, Intelligence office, medical, fire, public health, and other agencies often enough to man-
     age a comprehensive AT program. ATOs will at the same time work closely with intelligence per-
     sonnel to ensure they possess the full spectrum of threat information. Installation ATOs shall
     review MOAs/MOUs with the functional experts, at a minimum annually, and assess the adequacy
     of the MOAs/MOUs to ensure installations are able to respond to terrorist threats/attacks.
     2.6.4.2. Maintain liaison with MAJCOM AT staff officers to ensure AT currency.
     2.6.4.3. Coordinate training allocations to ensure deploying units have a primary and alternate

         or above) in writing to the base ATO. If applicable, the tenant/associate wing ATO will be the
         wing-level liaison with the base ATO. If no wing exists, the UATO will be the unit-level liaison
         with the base ATO on installation AT issues. Wing and/or UATOs will attend AT Level II training
         whenever it is offered by a visiting Mobile Training Team at the installation.

2.7. DoD Standard 7 - Application of Department of Defense (DoD) Terrorism Threat Analysis
Methodology. Commanders shall use the DoD Terrorism Threat Level classification system to identify
the terrorism threat in a specific overseas country.
     2.7.1. The DoD Terrorism Threat Level classification system is a set of standardized terms used to
     quantify the level of terrorism threat on a country-by-country basis. The terrorism threat level terms
     are Low, Moderate, Significant and High, and are defined in Attachment 4. The system evaluates the
     threat using a variety of analytical threat factors. Defense Terrorism Warning Reports are used to con-
     vey terrorist groups are operationally active and specifically targeting US interests. Either DIA or the
     Combatant Commanders, regardless of a country’s assigned threat level, issues warning reports.
     2.7.2. The DIA sets the DoD general terrorism threat level identifying the potential risk to US person-
     nel in a particular country. The DIA will coordinate, for clarity purposes, with DoS to minimize con-
     flicting threat levels assigned by each organization. The DoD threat level applies whether or not US
     personnel are present in the country. CINCs, with geographic responsibilities, may also set terrorism
     threat levels for specific personnel, family members, units and installations in countries within their
     AOR, using the definitions established by DIA. Commanders at all levels shall use their own threat
     analysis as the basis for developing plans and programs to protect assets for which they have AT
     responsibility. Terrorism Threat Levels are estimates with no direct relationship to specific Force Pro-
     tection Conditions (FPCONs). A FPCON is a security posture promulgated by the commander in con-
     sideration of a variety of factors (i.e., a terrorist threat analysis, threat level, etc.). Threat levels should
     not be confused with FPCONs.
     2.7.3. Effective application of the DoD Terrorism Threat Level classification system requires an inte-
     grated terrorism threat analysis, incorporating information collection and analysis from all sources,
     coupled with a thorough understanding of the threat analysis factors. Threat analysis factors must be
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                     21


   viewed in the context of the specific security environment pertaining to individuals, deployed units,
   facilities and installations resident in the country being analyzed. An integrated terrorism threat
   assessment uses a variety of intelligence information about a specified terrorist group to determine an
   individual, unit, facility and/or an installation’s vulnerability to a specific form of terrorist attack
   based on capabilities of terrorists and terrorist groups. Thus, the threat analysis should be supported by
   intelligence gathering (overseas) and information gathering (domestically) on the part of appropriate
   authorities.

2.8. DoD Standard 8 - Threat Information Collection and Analysis. Commanders shall task the
appropriate organizations under their command to gather, analyze, and disseminate terrorism threat infor-
mation, as appropriate.
   2.8.1. To support the commander, the Services should continuously ensure that forces are trained to
   maximize the use of information derived from law enforcement liaison, intelligence, and counterintel-
   ligence processes and procedures. This includes intelligence procedures for handling priority intelli-
   gence requests for in-transit units, as well as, implementation of procedures to conduct intelligence
   preparation of the battlefield and mission analysis.
   2.8.2. Identifying the potential terrorism threat to DoD personnel and assets is the first step in devel-
   oping an effective AT program. Commanders at all levels, who understand the threat, can assess their
   ability to prevent, survive, and prepare to respond to an attack.
   2.8.3. A terrorism threat assessment requires the analysis of all available information on terrorist
   activities. In addition to tasking appropriate agencies to collect information, commanders, at all levels,
   can and should encourage personnel under their command to report information on individuals, events
   or situations that could pose a threat to the security of DoD personnel, families, facilities and
   resources.
   2.8.4. At a strategic level, Headquarters Air Force Directorate of Intelligence, Surveillance and
   Reconnaissance (AF/XOI) is responsible for ensuring the timely collection processing, analysis, pro-
   duction and dissemination of foreign intelligence, current intelligence, and national level intelligence
   information concerning terrorist activities, terrorist organizations, and force protection issues. These
   efforts will focus on, but will not be limited to, transnational and state sponsored entities and organi-
   zations.
   2.8.5. Headquarters Air Force Office of Special Investigation (HQ AFOSI) has primary responsibility
   for the collection, all source tactical analysis, production and dissemination to U. S. military com-
   manders, the DOD and U.S. Intelligence communities of terrorist threat information gathered from
   federal, state and local authorities, host nation security services, and counterintelligence (CI) sources.

2.9. DoD Standard 9 - Threat Information Flow. Commanders, at all levels shall forward up and down
the chain of command all information pertaining to suspected terrorist threats or acts of terrorism involv-
ing DoD personnel or assets for which they have AT responsibility.
   2.9.1. The pattern of terrorist surveillance, targeting and planning is best recognized through the shar-
   ing of information. These efforts shall include the chain of command and the interagency process, at
   the appropriate level. When local information indicates gaps, unit commanders should forward timely
   requests for information to AFOSI, AF Intelligence, or other organizations via appropriate intelli-
22                        AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


     gence collection and production channels. Likewise, Component Commanders shall provide transit-
     ing units with tailored terrorist threat information.
     2.9.2. Installation commanders shall establish a Threat Working Group (TWG) to address the threat.
     TWGs generally consist of personnel from AFOSI, IN, SF, SG (Medical Intelligence Officer) and the
     installation ATO. A TWG’s primary function is to assess the threat for the commander and recom-
     mend courses of action to mitigate or counter the threat. Installation commanders should consider
     adding other agencies, particularly CE and SV, as appropriate, to enhance the TWG. A TWG does not
     fulfill the function of a FPWG. The TWG will meet, at a minimum, weekly to review the current threat
     and advise the installation commander accordingly.
     2.9.3. The installation's/activity's servicing AFOSI detachment is the primary focal point for collect-
     ing and reporting the terrorist threat. AFOSI detachments obtain terrorist threat information from a
     wide variety of counterintelligence activities and other sources of information.
     2.9.4. Commanders, down to the installation level, shall develop procedures to ensure Terrorism
     Threat Advisories, Terrorism Warning Reports, Terrorism Threat Level changes, and FPCON changes
     are immediately disseminated to all personnel and, as appropriate, supporting law enforcement agen-
     cies. Commanders should consider using “Giant Voice,” commander access cable channels, cable
     overrides, e-mail, marquees and any other methods that rapidly disseminate threat information to all
     personnel.
     2.9.4. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The 4 FW/CC directs all FPCON changes. Should the 4 FW/CC be
     unavailable, the succession of command may direct the change. The direction of a change is normally
     verbal through the Command Post. The tier notification system will be implemented. All unit Com-
     manders must ensure their unit process for implementation will work. Battlestaff Directives (BSDs)
     normally follow the verbal notification of an FPCON change. The BSD clarifies all measures and
     gives specific instructions for units and personnel. Do not wait on a BSD to begin implementing
     higher measures. Immediately implement measures required for the directed FPCON. Unit Operating
     Instructions (OIs) should address all measures required for each FPCON in checklist format. This
     should be available to all duty sections.

2.10. DoD Standard 10 – Potential Threat of Terrorist Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction
(WMD). Commanders, at all levels shall take appropriate measures to protect DoD personnel, families,
facilities and material, and reduce the vulnerability to terrorist use of WMD. Thus, CINCs and/or Services
and/or DoD Agencies shall develop WMD Threat Assessments for potential terrorist use of WMD against
personnel and assets for which they have AT responsibility. Reports through the chain of command shall
be processed immediately when significant information is obtained identifying organizations with WMD
capabilities.
     2.10.1. AF/XOI and HQ AFOSI collect, assess and disseminate intelligence estimates pertaining to
     the potential terrorist use of WMD, as referenced in DoD O 2000.12-H.
     2.10.2. HQ AFOSI will incorporate terrorist use of WMD into their installation’s threat assessment.

2.11. DoD Standard 11 - Adjustment of Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs). Combatant com-
manders have ultimate AT and force protection authority and responsibility within their AOR. Service
chiefs are responsible for AT and force protection authority for those personnel and assets for which they
have AT responsibility within the 50 United States. Commanders at all levels shall develop a process,
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                    23


based on terrorism threat information and/or guidance from higher headquarters, to raise or lower
FPCONs.
   2.11.1. The process to raise or lower FPCONs shall be tailored to the local mission and allow higher
   headquarters to direct downward implementation. The FPCON process shall comply with the guid-
   ance contained in DoD O-2000.12-H.
   2.11.2. Downward directed FPCONs (force protection condition alerting message [FPCAM]) require
   implementation of all measures for that FPCON, as listed in DoD O-2000.12-H, unless the directing
   authority grants relief.
       2.11.2.1. Periodically, after the initial FPCON implementation date, installation commanders
       shall reassess the local threat and report to higher headquarters conditions that would warrant a
       change to the current FPCONs and proposed measures to be taken based on the reassessment
   2.11.3. (Added-ACC) FPCON Measure Deviations. The inability to meet minimum DoD and Air
   Force installation antiterrorism requirements results in a higher force protection program risk. If it is
   determined certain mandated FPCON measures are inappropriate for current operations or negatively
   impact threat mitigation efforts, installation commanders may request a waiver in writing through
   their respective chain of command to the respective authority who declared the FPCON (i.e.; opera-
   tional requirements require vehicles be plugged into buildings in the winter). The waiver request will
   address the specific FPCON measure in question, the proposed action, efforts to mitigate related vul-
   nerabilities, and plans for the installation to come into compliance with the mandated FPCON mea-
   sure. Approval can only be granted by the declaration authority.
   2.11.3. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) All units and tenant organizations will develop a unit specific OI.
   Use Attachment 11(Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) as your guide. Comply with areas in Attach-
   ment 11(Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) such as development of the Random Antiterrorism Mea-
   sure (RAM) program for each unit. The inability to meet any AT/FP requirements must be
   immediately reported to the ATO. The ATO will evaluate and make recommendations to the unit to
   comply. If unit compliance is not possible, the unit will coordinate with the ATO for a formal relief
   through the wing commander. The wing commander is the approval authority for any noncompliance
   issue.
       2.11.3.1. (Added-ACC) ACC tenant units on non-ACC installations must comply with local
       installation AT programs and shall seek coordination for FPCON measure deviations through the
       host installation.
       2.11.3.1. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The 23 FG will comply with Pope AFB antiterrorism pro-
       gram requirements.

2.12. DoD Standard 12 - FPCON Measures Implementation. CINCs and/or Services, and/or DoD
Agencies shall ensure that FPCON transition procedures and measures are properly implemented and dis-
seminated by subordinate commanders.
   2.12.1. Tenant units, regardless of MAJCOM or service component, shall conform to the host instal-
   lation's FPCON. Additionally, tenants shall participate in all exercises with the host unit.
       2.12.1.1. (Added-ACC) NCC’s review INFOCONs upon FPCON notification to determine if
       INFOCON adjustments are required IAW guidance set forth in ACCI 10-2001, Information Oper-
       ations Conditions.
24                         AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


        2.12.1.1. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The Network Control Center (NCC) reviews threats to the
        network and coordinates with the ACC NOSC to increase or decrease the INFOCON level. This is
        a separate process from FPCON and is managed by the NCC.
     2.12.2. All agencies shall report their FPCON changes IAW AFMAN 10-206, Operational Report-
     ing. MAJCOM/SFs and FOAs will relay the FPCON change as soon as possible to HQ AFSFC Oper-
     ations Center, DSN: 473-0960, or mailto:SIPRNET hqafsfc@acc.af.smil.mil and/or STU III DSN:
     473-5543 for secure communications.

2.13. DoD Standard 13 - FPCON Measures. Commanders at all levels, both stationary and in transit,
shall develop site-specific measures or action tasks for each FPCON which supplements those measures/
actions enumerated for each FPCON as listed within Appendix A of DoD O-2000.12-H (reference c). An
AT Plan with a complete listing of site-specific AT measures, linked to a FPCON, will be classified, as a
minimum, CONFIDENTIAL. When separated from the AT Plan, site-specific AT measures and FPCONs
remain FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (if classification is necessary, mark as follows: Classified by: DoDI
2000.16, Standard 13, 14 Jun 01; Reason: 1.5(a); Declassify on: X4). These measures will change as the
threat situation increases from FPCON Normal to FPCON Delta.
     2.13.1. In developing site-specific FPCON measures, the commander must always consider those
     additional FPCON measures, which permit sufficient time and space to determine hostile intent, par-
     ticularly in accordance with the Standing Rules of Engagement. The component commander’s organic
     intelligence, counterintelligence, law enforcement resources, institutional knowledge of their area of
     AT responsibility and comprehensive understanding of unit capabilities, supported by national and
     theater assets, shall be leveraged in directing tailored FPCON measures to be implemented at specific
     sites for both stationary and in-transit units. To support both the component and local commanders in
     this effort, CINCs with geographic responsibilities should negotiate with host nations for authority to
     implement AT measure to provide such time and space.
     2.13.2. Commanders, at all levels (i.e. installation, tenant, GSU levels etc), shall establish local mea-
     sures to supplement DoD O-2000.12-H procedures to transition between FPCONs. Whereas Terror-
     ism Threat Levels are analytical assessments of terrorist activity in a country, FPCONs are graduated
     categories of measures or actions commanders take to protect personnel and assets from attack.
        2.13.2.1. Commanders, at all levels shall set local FPCONs. Subordinate commanders may raise
        a higher-level commander’s FPCON for those personnel and assets for which they have AT
        responsibilities. However, subordinate commanders shall not lower a higher commander's
        FPCONs without the higher-level commander's concurrence. Commanders shall ensure proper
        notifications are made.
        2.13.2.2. Installation and GSU commanders shall establish specific FPCON measures (tailored to
        the local mission, conditions, and the terrorist threat) to augment the DoD FPCON measures,
        listed in Attachment 3.
        2.13.2.3. Installation commanders must continuously evaluate available information about local
        terrorist activity to determine whether a terrorist threat to installation facilities or personnel exists.
        If the information warrants action, select and declare the appropriate FPCON. Commanders may
        modify their locally developed FPCON measures based on their requirements and to counter local
        threats.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                      25


   2.13.3. Installation commanders, in coordination with the installation TWG and/or FPWG, shall
   review local FPCON measures semi-annually to ensure threat mitigation measures are appropriate.
   Consideration shall be given to the most recent VA and current AFOSI counterintelligence threat
   assessment, when conducting this review.
   2.13.4. Installation and GSU commanders shall develop and implement a Random Antiterrorism
   Measures (RAM) program according to DoD O-2000.12-H that will include all units on the installa-
   tion. The RAM program shall be included in AT plans and tie directly with all FPCONs (including
   FPCON Normal), as listed in DoD O-2000.12-H to ensure continuity and standardization among the
   Services, should threats require USAF-wide implementation. Installations shall add local measures as
   required.
   2.13.4. (ACC) RAMs shall employ elements of information warfare, as required, to support Air Force
   antiterrorism measures. If military deception and/or operations security are deemed necessary, con-
   tact the host units military deception office and the OPSEC office for assistance in development of
   tactical deception and OPSEC measures.
       2.13.4.1. At least three RAMs chosen from higher FPCONs are required daily. RAM times for
       implementation, location and duration shall be regularly changed to avoid predictability.
       2.13.4.2. RAM execution shall be broad based and involve all units and personnel. ATOs are
       required to monitor, track and analyze RAM implementation efforts. Installation commanders will
       develop procedures to ensure RAMs are being conducted and reported to the ATO.
   2.13.5. Installation commanders shall incorporate AT measures in plans for functions such as change
   of commands, open houses, air shows and organized off-base activities.

2.14. DoD Standard 14 - Commanders Shall Maintain a Comprehensive AT Program for Those
Personnel and Assets for Which They Have AT Responsibilities. Planning is critical to deterrence,
detection, defense and response to terrorist incidents. Where possible, commanders may use as a guide,
the DoD Deputy Directorate for Operations (Combating Terrorism) J34, AT/FP Planning Template
CD-ROM and WMD Appendix. in DoDI 2000.16. The AT plan and elements shall clearly describe
site-specific AT measures. The AT plan and elements should be written from the CINC, Service, or DoD
Agency level, down to the installation level for permanent operations or locations and incorporated in
operations orders for temporary operations or exercises.
   2.14.1. To be proactive, all AT programs shall include tenets of countersurveillance (CS), counterin-
   telligence (CI) and other specialized skills as a matter of routine, and shall identify an appropriate
   organization as the focal point for the integration of local and/or host nation intelligence, counterintel-
   ligence and criminal intelligence information into AT operations. To that end, commanders at all lev-
   els shall constantly strive to ensure that proactive techniques and assets can be incorporated to detect
   and deter terrorists. CINCs and Services should ensure component commanders incorporate CI/CS
   assets in support of in-transit units, particularly at higher threat-level areas.
   2.14.2. Commanders, down to installation and GSU level, will develop and implement an AT plan.
   Commanders may use a stand-alone plan or include AT annexes in their existing force protection plan.
   Guidelines on AT planning are found in AFMAN 10-401, Volumes 1 & 2. Stand-alone documents
   (i.e., Standard Operating Procedures, local regulations, or Operations Orders that articulate require-
   ments for AT key elements) shall be replicated in and/or referenced in the AT Plan. Task appropriate
26                        AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


     level units for support, ensuring all organic, tenant and supported units are considered, and receive
     copies of the plans.
     2.14.2. (ACC) Installation AT Plans will be in the format provided in Attachment 9(Added-ACC).
     The AT Plan will be an overarching, comprehensive plan which integrates all base and community
     actions to deter, detect, defend, and respond to terrorist actions. Relevant portions of existing plans
     may be annexed into the Installation AT Plan.
        2.14.2.1. (Added-ACC) Each unit (e.g., detachment, squadron, group/wing staff, MAJCOM
        directorate, etc.) will create a checklist using AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist, with specific
        unit measures designed to support the base AT program, including RAM and FPCON implemen-
        tation. The installation ATO will maintain a copy of all unit checklists within the AT plan.
        2.14.2.1. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Each unit (e.g. detachment, squadron, group/wing staff) will
        create a checklist using AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist, with specific unit measures
        designed to support the base AT program, including RAM and FPCON implementation. RAMs
        should come from a higher FPCON measure and applied to facilities which are under a unit’s con-
        trol. Locally developed RAMs are encouraged. If a unit develops these for a unit specific RAM,
        coordinate with the ATO. The installation ATO will maintain a copy of all unit checklists within
        continuity folders. Make this checklist an attachment to your local unit OI. The ATO will mandate
        RAMs to be performed by individual units as needed. If a unit is assigned a RAM to implement
        they must comply. Furthermore, the unit must document and make notifications as required by the
        RAM notice.
     2.14.3. At a minimum, the AT Plan shall address the following key elements:
        2.14.3.1. Terrorism Threat Assessment (see Standard 15)
        2.14.3.2. Vulnerability Assessment (see Standard 26)
        2.14.3.3. Risk Assessment (see Standard 15)
        2.14.3.4. AT Physical Security Measures (see Standard 16)
        2.14.3.5. Terrorist Incident Response Measures (see Standard 17)
        2.14.3.6. Terrorist Consequence Management Measures (see Standard 18)

2.15. DoD Standard 15 - Terrorism Threat Assessment. Commanders shall prepare a terrorism threat
assessment for those personnel, assets, and mission critical infrastructures for which they have AT respon-
sibilities. Threat assessments shall be prepared at least annually and should identify the full range of
known or estimated terrorist capabilities for use in conducting VAs and planning countermeasures. Threat
analysis is required to adequately support risk management decisions of both stationed forces within, and
those in-transit through, higher-threat areas including ports, airfields and inland movement routes. Terror-
ism threat assessments shall be the basis and justification for recommendations on AT enhancements, pro-
gram/budget requests and the establishment of FPCONs.
     2.15.1. The terrorism threat assessment is the tool that commanders shall use to arrive at a judgment
     of risk and consequences of terrorist attack. Commanders shall integrate threat information prepared
     by the intelligence community, technical information from security and engineering planners and
     information from other sources to prepare their assessments. In addition to the annual threat assess-
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                  27


   ment used for AT Program planning, continuous analysis of threat information is required to support
   the threat warning process.
   2.15.2. CINCs and/or Services, and/or DoD Agencies shall designate which subordinate commanders
   will prepare these terrorism threat assessments. This normally applies to installation commanders and
   above.
       2.15.2.1. AFOSI will provide the installation’s counterintelligence threat assessment, which will
       address the threats from terrorism, agitational and subversive groups, criminal elements, and for-
       eign intelligence services. The counterintelligence threat assessment will be prepared annually
       and as changes in the threat require. AFOSI shall also provide a counterintelligence threat assess-
       ment to Air Force units deploying overseas. Upon notification of deployment, unit commanders
       will immediately contact their servicing AFOSI detachment and request a counterintelligence
       threat assessment. The assessment will be provided within 15 days of the unit's departure. .
   2.15.3. The process of producing terrorism threat assessments should include, as a minimum, liaison
   with the country team, host national security, husbanding contractor, and port authority, where appli-
   cable.
   2.15.4. Risk assessments provide commanders with a method to assist them in making resource allo-
   cation decisions designed to protect their people and assets from possible terrorist threats in a
   resource-constrained environment. Commanders shall conduct risk assessments to integrate threat and
   vulnerability information in order to make conscious and informed decisions to commit resources or
   enact policies and procedures to mitigate the threat or define the risk. A risk assessment allows the
   commander to obtain a clear picture of the current AT posture and identify those areas requiring
   improvement. During the risk assessment, important information is collected to assist in writing the
   overall AT Plan. While conducting risk assessments, commanders shall consider the following four
   elements:
       2.15.4.1. The terrorist threat.
       2.15.4.2. The criticality of infrastructures, facilities and assets.
       2.15.4.3. The vulnerability of critical infrastructures, facilities, food and water, programs, and
       systems to acts of terrorism (refer to paragraph 2.26.).
       2.15.4.4. The ability to conduct activities to deter terrorist incidents, employ countermeasures,
       mitigate the effects of a terrorist incident, and recover from a terrorist incident.
   2.15.5. The installation risk assessment must be reviewed annually by the Installation FPWG.

2.16. DoD Standard 16 - AT Physical Security Measures. AT physical security measures shall be con-
sidered, must support, and must be referenced within the AT Plan to ensure an integrated approach to ter-
rorist threats. Where there are multiple commanders at an installation, the installation commander is
responsible for coordinating and integrating individual unit physical security plans and measures into the
AT Plan.
   2.16.1. Tenant and in-transit units will comply with the host installation’s AT physical security mea-
   sures.
   2.16.2. The AT physical security measures shall integrate facilities, equipment, trained personnel and
   procedures into a comprehensive effort designed to provide maximum AT protection to personnel and
28                         AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


     assets. Well-designed AT physical security measures include detection, assessment, delay, denial and
     notification. This is best accomplished through the development of a synchronized matrix that out-
     lines who will do what, where, when and how. The measures should include provisions for the use of
     physical structures: physical security equipment; chemical, biological, radiological detections and
     protection equipment; security procedures; RAMs; response forces and emergency measures suffi-
     cient to achieve the desired level of AT protection and preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack.
     RAMs constitute a particularly effective method of deterrence of terrorist attack and should be used
     for both in place and transiting forces.
        2.16.2.1. Installation commanders shall incorporate physical security actions for the installation’s
        AT program in the installation security plans, full spectrum threat response plan, public affairs
        plans and/or resource protection plans. Forward all plans to the installation ATO. Plan actions
        shall be incorporated into the overarching AT plan and include the following:
            2.16.2.1.1. AT physical security measures.
            2.16.2.1.2. FPCON measures (must be site specific).
            2.16.2.1.3. Access control and entry control points.
            2.16.2.1.4. Mass notification.
            2.16.2.1.5. Delay elements - barrier plan, perimeter controls, RAMs and sensors.
            2.16.2.1.6. Response elements - security and law enforcement assets, contract/hired forces,
            unit guards, Resource Augmentation Duty (READY) and on-call support from reaction forces.
            2.16.2.1.7. Assessment of appropriate response measures, installation priorities and proce-
            dures for enhanced AT measures.
            2.16.2.1.8. Vulnerabilities and associated countermeasures (i.e., measures in a classified
            annex).
            2.16.2.1.9. AT training and education.
            2.16.2.1.10. Physical security of family members.
            2.16.2.1.11. Coordination/integration of individual unit physical security plans and measures.
     2.16.3. The installation barrier plan shall list in priority order: gates, roads and facilities to be pro-
     tected and types of passive barriers (i.e., serpentine jersey barriers, speed bumps, hedgehog barriers)
     to be used. The plan will detail the number of barriers required, where the barriers will be maintained/
     pre-positioned, the required equipment and the personnel assigned to move them and a detailed map
     of where/how the barriers will be placed. Installation commanders are highly encouraged to pre-posi-
     tion barriers at installation gates and key facilities to allow for the most rapid response to increased
     threats. Include basic elements of this plan as sub-elements of installation FPCON measures.
     2.16.3. (ACC) CES will design the base barrier plan, conduct an analysis with the ATO, SFS and LRS
     of traffic flows, and ensure a formal review by the base Traffic Management Board. The focus should
     be on a rapid deployment strategy and provide an implementation strategy for inclusion in the AT
     Plan.
     2.16.3. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The CES will develop the base barrier plan in coordination with the
     Wing ATO, SFS, and LRS. The focus should be on a rapid deployment strategy, provide an implemen-
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                      29


   tation strategy for inclusion in the AT Plan, and to determine where permanent barrier solutions can be
   included in base projects and future development areas.

2.17. DoD Standard 17 - Terrorist Incident Response Measures. Limiting the effects and the number
of casualties resulting from an attack will undermine the terrorist’s overall objectives. An effective inci-
dent response strategy and capability can contribute to deterring terrorist attacks if our adversaries recog-
nize the US ability to limit the effects of their attacks. Thus, installation and/or afloat commanders shall
prepare installation-wide and/or shipboard terrorist incident response measures. These measures shall
include procedures for determining the nature and scope of terrorist incident response; procedures for
coordinating security, fire and medical first responders; and steps to reconstitute the installation’s ability
to perform AT measures. Terrorist Incident Response measures should address the full scope of an instal-
lation’s response to a terrorist incident. The nature of the response depends on many factors. The character
of operations underway at the time of the terrorist incident will have significant bearing on the scope,
magnitude and intensity of response.
   2.17.1. Terrorist incident response measures shall include emergency response and disaster planning/
   consequence management for installation engineering, security, law enforcement, logistics, medical,
   mass casualty response, transportation, personnel administration and local/host nation support. In
   addition, special circumstances imposed by the nature of a terrorist attack may require broader analy-
   ses to include higher levels of authority or command. A terrorist attack on DoD installations requires
   immediate, close coordination with higher command.
   2.17.1. (ACC) In order to support terrorist incident response measures, installation commanders shall
   ensure key functional areas liaison with community and federal agencies and produce MOAs to lever-
   age and document support. ATOs shall review MOAs with the functional experts at least annually and
   assess the adequacy of MOAs to ensure installations are able to respond to terrorist threats/attacks.
   Local first responders should be included in all installation AT exercises to ensure MOAs are execut-
   able and realistic.
   2.17.1. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) The wing ATO must be included in reviews/changes of Memoran-
   dum of Agreements (MOAs) and Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) that relate to emergency
   support during incidents on or off the installation. A final copy of MOA/MOUs will be sent to the
   ATO, if ATO coordination was necessary.
       2.17.1.1. It is critical that geographic CINCs are able to deploy in a timely manner an organic Ter-
       rorist Incident Response Team capable of providing advice to the host nation, supporting emer-
       gency lifesaving and rescue functions, providing protection to DoD personnel and property,
       reducing the effects of further damage, and when appropriate, conducting/supporting criminal
       investigations. This preparation shall include the integration of teams in contingency planning for
       in-transit units. All MAJCOMs shall prepare command-wide terrorist incident response measures
       and ensure integration with the appropriate geographic CINC’s Terrorist Incident Response Team.
       2.17.1.2. Terrorist incident response measures shall include host nation/local law enforcement
       procedures to coordinate and employ response including communications, security, fire, explosive
       ordnance disposal (EOD) and medical. As terrorist attacks are criminal acts subject to prosecution,
       preservation of the scene for evidence collection and processing shall be addressed to the extent
       possible and when it would not jeopardize human life.
30                          AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


     2.17.2. Installation commanders shall establish an incident response plan to ensure the installation
     can respond to a terrorist attack. This plan may be an annex in existing plans. This plan/annex will
     include procedures for determining the nature and scope of post-incident response measures, plans to
     reconstitute the installation’s ability to perform AT measures, handle mass casualties and other areas
     as outlined in DoD Standard #17. For more detailed response measures to incidents involving WMD,
     refer to Annex D to the Full Spectrum Threat Response Plan, OPLAN 10-2., which may be cross-ref-
     erenced as a sup-portion of the overall installation AT plan. This plan will, as a minimum, be exer-
     cised annually.
     2.17.3. Installation service contracts will include measures to preclude the unmonitored presence of
     cleaning or other service personnel in vulnerable facilities. Contracts should also include procedures
     to have personnel consent to criminal background checks prior to being granted entry onto the instal-
     lation.
     2.17.4. Installation entry control procedures will be established for non-base connected personnel
     attending education classes, sporting events teams or other functions. Individuals should be briefed
     that their privileges are restricted to transit to and from the location of the activity. Installations should
     consider a means to readily identify (by distinctive pass or other identification) vehicles and personnel
     admitted to the installation for these purposes.
     2.17.4. (ACC) Visitors and delivery vehicle operators applying for a pass or providing a delivery to
     the installation should have their license plates and driver's license checked for outstanding warrants.
     Additionally, the industrial/contractor gate should have a computer system installed to provide, at a
     minimum, automated lists to ensure quick and efficient processing of personnel requiring entry. Such
     a capability will enable the controller to track changes in contractor authority lists and the numerous
     subcontractors that are employed for a given project.
     2.17.5. Inclusion of Off-Installation Personnel in AT Plans. Commanders shall ensure Terrorism Inci-
     dent Response measures contain current residential location information for all DoD personnel and
     their family members, when stationed outside of the United States, territories, and possessions in
     Moderate, Significant and High Terrorism Threat Level areas. Such measures should provide for
     enhanced security and/or possible evacuation of DoD personnel and their dependents. Furthermore,
     commanders in Moderate, Significant and High Terrorism Threat Level areas should investigate spe-
     cial security arrangements to protect DoD personnel and their dependents living on the economy.
     Close coordination with other US government agencies and the host nation is essential to ensure effec-
     tive allocation of security resources and protection of DoD personnel.
     2.17.6. (Added-ACC) Over-watch, both lethal and nonlethal, must be addressed in advance in the
     base AT plan. Prior to employing an over-watch position, the staff judge advocate must review and
     approve rules of engagement (ROE) (OCONUS only) and Rules for Use of Force. Whenever an
     over-watch position is employed, the position must have both nonlethal and lethal means of denying
     unauthorized entry, and must be positioned far enough away to monitor traffic and have enough time
     to react, both nonlethally and lethally, to unauthorized vehicles. Nonlethal means include, but are not
     limited to, tire deflation devices and/or a blocking vehicle. This may be accomplished by providing
     sufficient distance to react to a moving vehicle or by using devices such as speed bumps, rumble
     strips, or barriers. If lethal force is an option, a formal Operational Risk Management (ORM) review
     must be accomplished that addresses, at a minimum, rules of engagement, fields of fire, and potential
     for fratricide incidents. Communication between the over-watch position and the installation entry
     controllers is paramount. Pre-established signals (between the entry controller and over-watch posi-
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                   31


   tion) must be in place to ensure the over-watch position clearly understands when a vehicle needs to
   be stopped and if lethal or nonlethal measures must be taken. The position must be employed in a
   (chokepoint) fashion that prevents vehicles from maneuvering around the mitigating measures.
   2.17.6. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Over-watch, both lethal and non-lethal, procedures will be docu-
   mented in SF policy and procedures. This policy must be reviewed and approved by the Staff Judge
   Advocate.

2.18. DoD Standard 18 - Terrorist Consequence Management Measures. Although not an element
of AT, commanders shall include terrorist consequence management preparedness and response measures
as an adjunct to the installation AT Plan. The Terrorist Consequence Management measures should
include emergency response and disaster planning and/or preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack for
installation engineering, logistics, medical, mass casualty response, transportation, personnel administra-
tion and local and/or host nation support. In addition, special circumstances imposed by the nature of a
terrorist attack may require broader analyses to include higher levels of authority or command. Terrorist
use of WMD, or terrorist attacks on dignitaries, while visiting DoD installations, will require immediate
close coordination with higher command and the host nation and/or federal, state, and local authorities.
2.18. (ACC) DoD Standard 18 - Terrorist Consequence Management Measures. Weapons of Mass
Destruction (WMD) detection strategies should be multifunctional in approach. Readiness and Explo-
sives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) will be the OPR for developing criteria for the selection of WMD detec-
tion equipment, including developing maintenance, training, and employment plans.
   2.18.1. Terrorist Consequence Management planning will be in accordance with AFI 10-2501 and
   will address:
       2.18.1.1. Response assessments to terrorist use of WMD and identification of long-term upgrade
       requirements and appropriate measures to mitigate potential threats.
       2.18.1.2. Recovery plans/annexes specifically addressing command, control and communications
       between local, state and host nation emergency assistance agencies, procedures to protect, respond
       to and reduce the vulnerability of USAF personnel to WMD. Installation plans shall clearly iden-
       tify first responders and other follow-on support teams.
       2.18.1.3. Appropriate measures, including attack warning, to notify and protect personnel and
       reduce the vulnerability to the threat of use of WMD. Plans shall identify responders, specific
       local/host nation support, ensure appropriate antibiotics and antidotes are supplied, personnel are
       trained and that all personnel (including family members) are aware of the threat and can respond
       accordingly.
       2.18.1.4. Mass casualty response includes: casualty triage procedures, (medical treatment, decon-
       tamination, evacuation and tracking, site security, evidence preservation and contamination con-
       trol measures and detailed interagency support and coordination measures.
       2.18.1.5. Ensure first responders and treatment personnel are designated, trained, and equipped to
       respond to WMD/HAZMAT incidents IAW AFPD 10-26, Counter-NBC Operational Prepared-
       ness; AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response, Planning and Operations; AFH 20-2502,

2.19. DoD Standard 19 - Training and Exercises. Commanders, (ship, squadron, battalion-level and
above), shall conduct field and staff training to exercise AT Plans, to include AT physical security mea-
sures, terrorist incident response measures, and terrorist consequence management measures, at least
annually. AT training and exercises shall be provided the same emphasis afforded combat task training
and executed with the intent to identify shortfalls impacting the protection of personnel and assets against
terrorist assault and subsequent consequence management efforts. AT training, particularly pre-deploy-
ment training, shall be supported by measurable standards and include credible deterrence/response, tac-
tics, techniques, and procedures. AT training shall also be incorporated into unit-level training plans and
pre-deployment exercises. To realize incorporation of lessons learned, commanders should maintain exer-
cise documentation for no less than one year.
2.19. (ACC) DoD Standard 19 - Training and Exercises. ACC installations will conduct two AT exer-
cises (one major and one minor) annually. AT exercise scenarios may be held in conjunction with other
Air Force required exercises (e.g., HAZMAT, Force-on-Force, Mass Casualty, etc.) to meet various AFI
requirements. Each AT exercise will be documented by the base EET, providing a critique with findings,
observations, and lessons learned. The installation FPWG will be responsible for tracking exercise find-
ings and documenting actions taken to mitigate shortfalls and vulnerabilities, and improve AT/FP pro-
cesses.
     2.19.1. Commanders, at all levels, shall ensure joint and/or combined operations and/or exercises
     incorporate AT training and planning for forces involved. To realize incorporation of lessons learned:
        2.19.1.1. AF installations/sites shall exercise and evaluate the installations overall AT Awareness
        posture IAW Table 1.1 of this instruction and DoDI 2000.16, Standard 22, table 1.1. Exercise the
        installation terrorism incident response plan annually.
        2.19.1.1. (ACC) The major AT exercise will have maximum participation by all base units,
        including tenant units, with a minimum of simulation. Wings should make every effort to use
        local community first responders for this exercise. The major AT exercise must include:
            2.19.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Indications of surveillance on and off base to test base reporting
            procedures.
            2.19.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) Implementation of each FPCON with enough time spent on each
            FPCON to fully evaluate its effectiveness.
            2.19.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) Full implementation and evaluation of the installation barrier plan.
            2.19.1.1.4. (Added-ACC) Mass notification procedures.
            2.19.1.1.5. (Added-ACC) Evaluate reporting plans to evaluate traffic flows and unit support
            of staggered reporting plans.
            2.19.1.1.6. (Added-ACC) The remaining exercise will be, at a minimum, table-top exercises
            with first responder elements including Disaster Control Group (DCG) membership, bioenvi-
            ronmental engineering, SF, EOD, Emergency Medical Services, Fire Department, HAZMAT,
            Public Health, and Readiness. The focus of this exercise should be on the integration of first
            responder procedures and tactics, and whenever possible, include local authorities who would
            be involved in base AT plans through MOAs.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                   33


       2.19.1.2. Pre-deployment training regimes shall include credible deterrence and response stan-
       dards and deterrence-specific tactics, techniques and procedures. Pre-deployment training shall
       also include terrorist scenarios and hostile intent decision-making.
       2.19.1.3. AT training shall also be incorporated into unit-level training plans and exercises.
       2.19.1.4. Installation commanders will ensure base-wide training exercises are conducted annu-
       ally IAW the AT Plan. The exercises shall include all FPCON measures, evacuation procedures,
       notification plan, terrorist use of WMD and other key areas outlined in their installation’s AT
       Plans.

2.20. DoD Standard 20 - Comprehensive AT Review. Commanders at all levels shall review their own
AT Programs and Plans at least annually to facilitate AT program enhancement. Furthermore, for the same
purpose, commanders at all levels shall likewise review the AT program and plan of their immediate sub-
ordinate in the chain of command at least annually. While such reviews do not constitute a VA, they are
intended to ensure compliance with the standards contained in this Instruction. To ensure the design and
implementation of physical security measures coincident with the AT program are consistent with the
local terrorist threat level, AT programs shall also be reviewed when the terrorism threat level changes.
   2.20.1. AF installations/sites will review and exercise their AT Program/Plan, listed in paragraph
   2.20., at least annually.
       2.20.1.1. (Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Annual program assistance visits (PAVs) of unit-level
       AT/FP programs will be conducted annually for each unit and tenant to facility program enhance-
       ment. The Wing ATO will maintain the schedule of PAVs and findings. Units requiring corrective
       actions will be suspensed to document corrective actions within 30 calendar days. PAV results will
       be briefed at the FPWG. Each unit/agency must maintain a unit continuity book.

2.21. DoD Standard 21 - General Requirements for AT Training. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD
Agencies shall ensure all assigned personnel receive appropriate training to advance AT awareness. Indi-
vidual records shall be updated to reflect AT training in accordance with DoD Component policy.
2.21. (ACC) DoD Standard 21 - General Requirements for AT Training. HQ ACC/SFOT evaluates AT
training requirements and addresses shortfalls to ensure required training is conducted and tracked within
the command.
   2.21.1. AF installations/sites will update AT awareness training IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Train-
   ing Program.

2.22. DoD Standard 22 - Level I AT Awareness Training. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD Agen-
cies shall ensure that every military service member, DoD employee, and local national hired by the DoD,
regardless of rank, is made aware of the need to maintain vigilance for possible terrorist actions and
employ AT tactics, techniques and procedures, as discussed in DoD O-2000.12-H and Joint Pub 3-07.2.
Furthermore, the Air Force shall offer Level I AT Awareness Training to contractor employees, under
terms and conditions as specified in the contract.
   2.22.1. CINCs, and/or Services, and/or DoD Agencies shall ensure every family member accompany-
   ing DoD personnel overseas is made aware of the need to maintain vigilance for possible terrorist
   actions and employ AT tactics, techniques and procedures, as discussed in 2000.12H and Joint Pub
   3-07.2. Thus, family members 14 years and older (or younger at discretion of the DoD sponsor) trav-

     eling beyond CONUS on official business, (i.e. on an accompanied permanent change of station
     move) shall receive Level I AT Awareness Training as part of their pre-departure requirements. Fur-
     thermore, the commander should encourage family members to receive Level I AT Awareness Train-
     ing prior to any OCONUS travel ( i.e., leave).
     2.22.2. Individual security awareness and individual AT training are essential elements of an overall
     AT program. Each individual must be exposed at the earliest opportunity to share the responsibility of
     ensuring alertness and the application of personal protection measures. Therefore, CINCS/and/or Ser-
     vices and/or DoD agencies shall provide Level I AT Awareness Training in basic training or in general
     military subject training for all initial entry Service and DoD Agency personnel.
     2.22.3. Thereafter, CINCs, and/or Services, and/or DoD agencies shall provide Level I AT Awareness
     Training:
        2.22.3.1. Annually to all OCONUS-based DoD personnel.
        2.22.3.2. Annually to all CONUS-based DoD personnel who are eligible for OCONUS deploy-
        ment. Active uniformed CONUS-based members of the CINCS and Services shall receive Level I
        training annually. Subsequently, DoD personnel deploying OCONUS shall be provided, within 3
        months of deployment, an AOR update (refer to DoD Standard 23 below).
        2.22.3.3. Annually to all CONUS-based DoD personnel, regardless of duty status, if the CONUS
        Terrorism Threat Level is promulgated above "MODERATE."
        2.22.3.4. Annual Level 1 AT awareness training may be accomplished by any level II certified
        personnel or per DoD sponsored computer-based training and/or distance learning.
     2.22.4. Level I training shall be documented as follows:
        2.22.4.1. The Military Personnel Flight (MPF) Outbound Assignments Section will document
        Level I training for individuals, and their dependents that are 14 years or older, relocating due to
        an OCONUS PCS on the relocation checklist. The checklist will include this training requirement
        in their relocation-processing letter. Training must be completed prior to final out-processing.
        2.22.4.1. (SEYMOUR JOHNSON) Ancillary Training Requirements. All personnel, military and
        DoD civilians (Civilians are defined by DoD as "U.S. citizens or foreign nationals working for the
        Department of Defense and paid from appropriated or non-appropriated funds under permanent or
        temporary appointment. This includes employees filling full-time, part-time, intermittent, or
        on-call positions. Specifically excluded are all Government contractor employees", are required to
        have Level I AT/FP training annually. Air Force personnel will receive a threat brief within three
        months of any deployment, leave, or travel outside the continental United States. Contractors and
        dependents should be encouraged to receive the briefing if they would like before leaving the
        CONUS for any reason. The Unit AT/FP monitor will maintain a record of trained individuals and
        provide a copy of the record to the Unit Ancillary Training Manager. AT/FP training will be docu-
        mented in MILPDS or through normal ancillary records if documenting the training cannot be
        done through MILPDS. The Unit Training Manager (UTM) will ensure this requirement is met as
        well as ensuring the training is documented. The Unit Deployment Manager (UDM) will maintain
        a copy of completion in individual mobility folders to ensure personnel going TDY have received
        the training prior to departure. The AT/FP monitor will submit training statistics to 4 FW/XP NLT
        the last Friday of each month using the format in Attachment 13(Added-SEYMOUR

     JOHNSON). UTMs should encourage the use of the Web based Computer Based Training to con-
     duct Level I training. Individuals should print the certificate as proof of completion.
     2.22.4.2. Unit Deployment Managers (UDMs) shall document Level I training for individuals
     projected for TDY OCONUS. UDMs will ensure individuals receive the training prior to deploy-
     ment. Additionally, unit ancillary training managers will document Level I AT Awareness Train-
     ing with the date of completion in Military Modernization Personnel Data System (MILPDS).
     2.22.4.3. Unit training mangers shall document Level 1 AT awareness training through normal
     ancillary records when documentation through PCS/TDY checklist or MILPDS is not possible.
  2.22.5. The unit responsible for preparing orders shall refer to DoD 4500.54-G, DoD Foreign Clear-
  ance Guide (can be web-accessed at http://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg/geninfo1.htm) for individuals
  going PCS or TDY and ensure compliance and documentation of AT training.
  2.22.6. AF installation/site commanders shall:
     2.22.6.1. Develop procedures to ensure Level I AT Awareness Training is offered to all military
     service and DoD employee family members traveling OCONUS on unofficial travel such as leave.
     2.22.6.2. Ensure everyone traveling to DoD-designated high physical threat countries, as defined
     in the Foreign Clearance Guide, receives (briefed) the OASD SO/LIC or USAF/ILT DoD Travel
     Security Advisories and any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) travel advisories.
     2.22.6.3. Report quarterly to HQ USAF/XOFP, (through installation ATOs through MAJCOM
     ATOs) all personnel who arrive on-station without Level I AT Awareness Training. Full Name,
     Rank, Sending Unit, Sending MAJCOM, Receiving Unit, Receiving MAJCOM and total number
     of gains for the period shall be included in the report. (RCS: HAF-SFC(AR)0126, Training

     https://www.afmia.randolph.af.mil/afmia/mip/mipp/perf_mgt/documents/vol2annex.doc.
  2.22.8. Individuals may become qualified to administer Level I AT Awareness Training via two meth-
  ods:
     2.22.8.1. Attending a formal Service-approved Level II ATO Training course of instruction (see
     Table 1.2 for minimum training standards). The training must include a review of current AT pub-
     lications and methods for obtaining AOR-specific terrorism threat analysis, updates and warnings.
     2.22.8.2. Certification by the installation commander. Installation commanders, may qualify indi-
     viduals who are subject matter experts and have received formal training in AT and individual pro-
36                        AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


        tection measures (i.e., security forces, AFOSI special agents, etc.) and who have received specific
        formal training in AT tactics, techniques, and procedures. Installation commanders may individu-
        ally exempt these individuals from the Level II ATO training requirements, as outlined in Table
        1.2, if the individuals have also received training that covers reviewing current AT publications
        and identifying methods for obtaining AOR-specific updates.
            2.22.8.2.1. All Air Force AT Officers/NCOs (required by Standard 6) will receive formal edu-
            cation at an approved Level II course. This requirement cannot be waived. Installation com-
            manders may qualify individuals to deliver Level I training, as stated in the previous
            paragraph, but not designate them as their Standard 6 AT Officer/NCO. Attachment 7 lists
            USAF approved courses.
     2.22.9. HQ AFOSI and HQ AFSFC/SFP jointly develop AT awareness briefings for use in delivering
     Level I training. AFOSI will prepare and ensure the AOR specific terrorist threat is updated quarterly
     or when significant changes in the threat warrant. Level I training offered by other Services or DoD
     agencies meets DoD requirements as long as they fulfill all requirements listed in Table 1.1.
        2.22.9.1. Table 2.1. below outlines Level I AT Awareness Training requirements.

2.23. DoD Standard 23 - AOR-Specific Training Requirements for all DoD Personnel. CINCs with
geographic responsibilities shall ensure that all DoD personnel entering their AOR have been provided
access to AOR-specific information on AT protection.
     2.23.1. CINCs, with geographic responsibilities have significant responsibilities for protecting per-
     sonnel within their AOR. Individuals traveling outside CONUS for either permanent or temporary
     duty shall have completed annual Level I AT Awareness Training and have received an AOR-specific
     threat update within three months prior to travel. This information may be provided through multiple
     means including CINCs publications, messages, and computer home pages. Losing CINCs and/or
     Services and/or DOD Agencies shall ensure that personnel departing to another CINC’s geographical
     AOR shall be exposed to and execute the requirements of the gaining CINC’s AOR-update.
     2.23.2. Furthermore, to enhance the situational awareness and AT preparedness of units prior to tran-
     sit through and/or deployment to heightened threat areas, gaining CINCs, with geographic responsi-
     bilities, shall provide detailed threat information covering transit routes and sites that will be visited
     by the deployed unit. Such information shall include detailed, focused information on potential terror-
     ist threat (i.e., tailored production and analysis) to aid in the development of tailored AT planning.
     Since component commanders possess organic intelligence and organic or supporting law enforce-
     ment resources, institutional knowledge of their AOR and a comprehensive understanding of unit
     capabilities, they are best suited to provide such information, when augmented or supported by
     national and theater assets.
     2.23.3. Commanders shall ensure personnel deploying, PCSing, or traveling on leave outside the
     CONUS receive pre-deployment AT awareness training with a special emphasis on AOR-specific ter-
     rorist and medical threats. Commanders shall develop procedures to ensure this training is conducted
     prior to departing home station and AOR-specific information is incorporated into their pre-deploy-
     ment AT Level I awareness-training program. AOR-specific threat briefing information for the geo-
     graphic CINCs can be found on the Internet & SIPRNET sites listed in Attachment 5.

2.24. DoD Standard 24 - Level II Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) Training. Level II ATO Training is
designed to produce an AT advisor to the commander. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD Agencies shall
ensure that each installation and/or deploying unit (i.e., battalion, squadron, ship) is assigned at least one
Level II ATO trained individual.
     2.24.1. Level II training is designed to qualify individuals assigned as installation ATOs. The training
     also serves as the primary venue for qualifying AT representatives that deploy forward as AT Advi-
     sors. Each AF installation and deploying unit will assign a primary and alternate ATO who will attend
     Level II training as a minimum standard. While not required, ATOs may also attend courses such as
     Dynamics of International Terrorism (DIT), Combating Terrorism on Military Installations, and other
     Service Level II Courses to enhance their proficiency. Level II graduates can also provide Level I
     training. Each installation requiring Level II training for their assigned ATO or other personnel will
     schedule training through their MAJCOM/SF or MAJCOM training course IAW MAJCOM instruc-
     tions. Level II training is open to all career fields.
     2.24.2. MAJCOMs who desire to establish their own Level II training programs, will submit a Plan of
     Instruction to HQ AFSFC/SFP for approval prior to initiating any training.
        2.24.2.1. All Air Force Level II programs will use the standardized curriculum based on the
        requirements for Level II courses found in Table 1.2. MAJCOMs may add command-specific

         instructors.
         2.24.2.1.4. While not required, each Level II course should add the following capabilities to
         enhance the effectiveness of their Level II courses:
             2.24.2.1.4.1. Consider inviting subject matter experts from agencies such as the FBI,
             AFOSI, EOD, Medical Group, etc., to brief subject areas. Video teleconferencing should
             be considered, if available.
             2.24.2.1.4.2. Ready access to SIPRNET.
         2.24.2.1.5. (Added-ACC) The 99 GCTS AT Level II course cadre will provide a proposed cal-
         endar year schedule for the new fiscal year to HQ ACC/SFOT NLT 1 September. The sched-
         ule will include 17 annual Nellis-based course offerings to be advertised Air Force and
         DoD-wide. MTTs will be scheduled with all ACC bases to ensure Level II MTT training on a

     2.24.10. Level IV AT Executive Seminar. The Level IV AT Executive Seminar is designed to expose
     senior officers in the grade of O-6 through O-8 and DoD civilians equivalent in grades to AT issues.
        2.24.10.1. AF Level IV Executive-Level Commander Training is accomplished by the Combating
        Terrorism Directorate of the Joint Staff (J34). It is designed for installation commanders, Joint
        Task Force (JTF)/Battle Group level commanders, and those responsible for AT policy, planning
        and execution. Once training quotas are established through J34, allocations are made through the
        AF General Officer Matters Office and AF Colonel Matters Office. Nominee selection will be by
        position, based on assignment in, or to high-risk locales.
        2.24.10.2. Table 2.4. Outlines Level IV AT Executive Seminar training requirements.

to AT Programs and Policies.
                               who are responsible
                               for AT programs or
                               involved in AT policy,
                               planning and
                               execution.

     2.24.11. Commanders at all levels, who receive individuals that are not properly trained, shall, in the
     interest of force protection, provide the required AT training as soon as practicable upon the gain.
     Concurrently, they shall report the deficiency through their DoD component chain of command. The
     DoD component shall subsequently notify the providing commander and ensure appropriate measures
     are generated to prevent reoccurrence of the discrepancy.

2.25. DoD Standard 25 - Training for High-Risk Personnel and High-Risk Billets. C I N C s a n d / o r
Services and/or DoD Agency Heads have been given substantial AT responsibilities for DoD personnel
assigned to high-risk billets or at high risk to terrorist attacks. High-risk personnel are eligible for
advanced AT training. In some instances, this training may be extended to include family members.
     2.25.1. The Services and DoD Agency Heads shall ensure personnel designated as “Personnel at
     High-Risk to Terrorist Attack” and “Personnel Assigned to High-Risk Billets” receive appropriate
     training. To this end, CINCs with geographic responsibilities shall communicate high-risk positions
     and high-risk personnel to their Service authority for AT, not less than annually to enable the Services
     to provide for the requisite training. Whenever possible, the Services should conduct the appropriate
     AT training of designated personnel prior to arrival in theater.
     2.25.2. MAJCOM, FOA and DRU commanders decide if senior Air Force officials assigned to or vis-
     iting high-threat areas will be designated high-risk personnel.
     2.25.3. Travel of high-risk personnel. When the threat dictates, commanders shall restrict details of
     the travel arrangements for high-risk individuals or senior officials (general officer or civilian equiva-
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                       45


   lent) to reduce the vulnerability to attack. Unless absolutely necessary for travel security, do not stop
   public announcements of special events, guest speakers or other ceremonies senior officials attend.
   Make such announcements without divulging the specific travel itinerary or local arrangements.
   2.25.4. Itineraries for high-risk billeted personnel and personnel susceptible to terrorist attacks shall,
   at a minimum, be marked For Official Use Only (FOUO). Consider classifying travel itineraries as
   CONFIDENTIAL, when officials travel to high-threat areas. Declassify itineraries when the trip is
   over.
   2.25.5. During increased FPCONs, residential and travel security of assigned or visiting high- risk
   personnel or other probable terrorist targets, should be increased to counter the threat. Ensure these
   personnel receive timely security awareness briefings. For the most serious cases, request protective
   services from AFOSI. AFOSI will provide protective services, including long-term protective service
   operations (PSO), when specific, credible threats exist and when the requester and AFOSI jointly
   determine such protection is needed.

2.26. DoD Standard 26 - Vulnerability Assessment of Installations.
   2.26.1. Assessment Focus. Vulnerability assessment shall focus on the assessed installation overarch-
   ing AT program. AT programs should be subject to continual assessment to avoid complacency and
   gain benefit from experience from other assessments. Evolving terrorism threats, changes in security
   technology, development and implementation of alternative concepts of peacetime operations and
   changing local conditions make periodic assessment essential. VAs will normally occur at the installa-
   tion commander level and above; however, because VAs are critical to forces transiting through ports,
   airfields, and inland movement routes, geographic CINCs shall ensure component commanders con-
   duct VAs frequently enough to ensure timely and accurate information is available. These assessments
   should consider the range of identified and projected terrorism threats against a specific location or
   installation, personnel, family members, facilities and other assets. The assessment should identify
   vulnerabilities and solutions for enhanced protection of DoD personnel and resources.
      2.26.1.1. AT Assessment Functional Areas. AT VAs provide a vulnerability-based analysis of an
      activity's AT program. The assessment identifies, for the commander, vulnerabilities that may be
      exploited by terrorists and suggests options that may eliminate or mitigate those vulnerabilities.
      The assessment team shall evaluate the installations overall AT Awareness posture IAW Table 1.1
      of this instruction and DoDI 2000.16, Standard 22, table 1.1.
      2.26.1.2. All VAs will be classified in accordance with the DTRA Security Classification Guide.
   2.26.2. There are two types of VAs: the local VA and the higher headquarters VA.
      2.26.2.1. Installation commanders shall have the ATO form a multi-functional VA team (i.e.,
      AFOSI, CE, SV, SF, IN, SC, MG, etc.) to conduct the local VA. The VA shall address the full spec-
      trum of threats to mission-essential critical infrastructures and assets, security of personnel, phys-
      ical threats and installation infrastructures. Utilities, facilities with large populations, food, water,
      fire protection, medical response, communication centers, etc., shall all be addressed in the assess-
      ment. The assessment shall provide solutions for enhanced protection of DoD personnel and
      resources. Installation commanders shall forward copies of the VA to their NAF and MAJCOM to
      help coordinate resource allocation and advocacy.
          2.26.2.1.1. Local VAs shall be conducted at least annually, except for those years when a
          higher headquarters VA is conducted.
46                         AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


            2.26.2.1.1. (ACC) When conducting local VAs, installations will use the AFSFC Antiterror-
            ism Vulnerability Assessment Guidelines. Wings will update VAMP within 10 days of a local
            assessment report being approved by the wing commander.
     2.26.3. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) VAs. CINCs/Services/Agencies shall ensure lower level AT Pro-
     grams receive a HHQ VA, at least once every three years, to ensure unity of AT efforts throughout
     their subordinate commands. Each CINC, Service Chief and DoD Agency Director shall track and
     identify vulnerabilities throughout the chain of command. As a minimum, each commander or direc-
     tor shall prioritize, track and report to the next general/flag officer, the action to be taken to address
     vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability assessment.
     2.26.3. (ACC) Installation commanders have the authority to accept the risk for identified vulnerabil-
     ities. Commanders will formally accept the risk for the cited vulnerability with a memorandum to the
     NAF/CC (classified) that describes the vulnerability and the discussion points behind the decision to
     accept the risk associated with the vulnerability narrative. Installation commanders must also indicate
     this via their VAMP database by accepting the risk for that vulnerability.
        2.26.3.1. Installation commanders shall work with their MAJCOM to ensure they receive such
        assessments once every three years as a minimum, or as specified by the CINC with responsibility
        for the AOR. To provide essential visibility, as a minimum, installation commanders shall priori-
        tize, track and report the vulnerabilities identified to the next general officer or equivalent and the
        action taken following the VA.
     2.26.4. JSIVA, AF or MAJCOM VA Teams shall accomplish HHQ VAs. Each of these agencies may
     conduct independent or joint assessments. The Air Force VA Team (VAT) may also conduct
     "over-the-shoulder" observations of MAJCOM assessments and conduct other assessments, as
     directed by AF/XOF or the Air Staff FPWG. MAJCOMs may establish a team to conduct the assess-
     ments and, if established, shall provide a copy of their assessment schedule to AFSFC/SFP by 15 Sep-
     tember annually. Installations scheduled to receive AF VAs shall provide the information requested in
     Attachment 6 of this instruction to HQ AFSFC/SFP NLT 30 days prior to their scheduled assessment
     by way of e-mail.
     2.26.5. HHQ VA Scheduling. MAJCOM SFs are responsible for keeping track of the frequency and
     scheduling of VAs for their subordinate installations. HQs AFSFC schedules HHQ VAs contingent on
     input from the MAJCOM SF. This process is accomplished once a year with candidate installation
     input provided from the MAJCOM SF to HQ AFSFC. HQ AFSFC will request VA nominees by 15
     September of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the assessment.
     2.26.6. HHQ VAs satisfies the annual requirement for Local VAs.
     2.26.7. VA Site Criteria. HHQ VAs shall be conducted at DoD components, housing areas, facilities
     and/or activities/locations and command levels identified as "installations." For the purposes of this
     instruction, the following defines an assessment-eligible installation:
        2.26.7.1. Any DoD facility consisting of 300 or more personnel on a daily basis.
        2.26.7.2. Any DoD facility bearing responsibility for emergency response and physical security
        plans and programs.
        2.26.7.3. Any DoD facility possessing authority to interact with local non-military or host nation
        agencies or having agreements with other agencies or host nation agencies to procure these ser-
        vices.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                      47


     2.26.7.4. HHQ VAs may be conducted at any DoD Component Activity, when CINCs, and/or Ser-
     vices and/or Agencies identify a time critical requirement or emergent need.
  2.26.8. VAs conducted to meet the requirement contained in this standard must assess as a minimum,
  the following functional areas:
     2.26.8.1. AT Plans and Programs. The assessment shall examine the assessed installation's/activ-
     ity's AT program and ability to accomplish appropriate standards contained in DoDI 2000.16, this
     AFI, and applicable prescriptive standards established by the appropriate CINC/Service/Agency.
         2.26.8.1.1. The assessment shall examine written plans in the areas of counterintelligence, law
         enforcement liaison, intelligence support, security and post-incident response (the ability of
         the installation/activity to respond to terrorist incidents, especially mass casualty events, to
         include a disease outbreak caused by terrorist use of a biological weapon).
         2.26.8.1.2. The assessment shall examine the degree to which plans complement one another
         and support the assessed installation's/activity's ability to identify changes in the terrorist
         threat, react to threat changes by implementing appropriate AT measures and provide appro-
         priate responses should a terrorist event occur.
         2.26.8.1.3. The assessment shall examine the availability of resources to support plans as writ-
         ten and the frequency and extent to which plans have been exercised.
     2.26.8.2. Counterintelligence, Law Enforcement Liaison and Intelligence Support. The assess-
     ment shall focus on an installation’s/activity’s ability to receive threat information and warnings
     from HHQ and local resources, actively collect information on the threat (when permitted), pro-
     cess that information to include local fusion and analysis, and develop a reasonable postulated
     threat statement of the activity. The assessment shall also examine an installation’s/activity’s abil-
     ity to disseminate threat information to subordinate commands, tenant organizations, in-transit
     units, geographically separated units and assigned or visiting DoD personnel (including military
     members, civilian and contractor employees and family members). The assessment shall also
     examine how the process supports the implementation of appropriate force protection measures to
     protect military personnel, DoD civilians, and family members.
         2.26.8.2.1. The assessment shall focus on the most probable terrorist threat for the installation/
         activity and appropriate countermeasures. In cases where no identified threat exists, the instal-
         lation/activity shall be assessed on their ability to implement AT measures under increasing
         FPCONs, in response to increased terrorist threat levels or terrorist threat warnings.
     2.26.8.3. AT Physical Security Measures. The assessment shall determine the assessed installa-
     tion's/activity's ability to protect personnel by detecting or deterring terrorists, and failing that, to
     protect by delaying or defending against terrorist acts. Physical security techniques include proce-
     dural measures such, as perimeter security, security force training, security surveys, medical sur-
     veillance for unnatural disease outbreaks and armed response to warning or detection. The
     assessment shall also determine physical security measures such as fences, lights, food and water,
     intrusion detection devices, access control systems, closed circuit television cameras, personnel
     (to include Resource Augmentation Duty (READY), vehicle barriers, biological, chemical and
     radiological agent detectors and filters, and other security systems effectiveness. The assessment
     shall consider commercial, off-the-shelf AT technology enhancements and potential solutions for
     those circumstances where existing technology or procedural modifications do not provide satis-
     factory solutions.
48                         AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


        2.26.8.4. Vulnerability to a Threat and Terrorist Incident Response Measures. The assessment
        shall examine the assessed installation's/activity's ability to determine its vulnerabilities against
        commonly used terrorist weapons and explosive devices, to include terrorist use of WMD. The
        assessment shall further examine the ability to provide structural or infrastructure protection
        against terrorist events. The ability to respond to a terrorist event, with emphasis on a mass casu-
        alty situation, shall also be examined.
        2.26.8.5. VAs for Terrorist Use of WMD. The assessment shall assess the vulnerability of instal-
        lations, facilities and personnel, and family members within their AOR to terrorist use of WMD.
        Such assessments address potential use of chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological agents and
        shall be developed with supporting base agencies, such as civil engineering, readiness, medical,
        etc.
        2.26.8.6. Host Nation, Local Community, Inter-Service and Tenant Support. The assessment shall
        examine the level and adequacy of support available to an installation/activity from the host nation
        or local community, MAJCOM, HQ USAF and where appropriate, inter-service and tenant orga-
        nizations to enhance AT measures or response to terrorist incidents.
            2.26.8.6.1. The assessment shall determine the integration and feasibility of plans with host
            nation, local community, MAJCOM, HQ USAF, and inter-service and tenant organizations to
            provide security, law enforcement, fire, medical and emergency response capability in
            response to terrorist events, with emphasis on mass casualty situations.
            2.26.8.6.2. The assessment shall determine the adequacy of resources available to execute
            agreements and the extent and frequency to which plans have been exercised.
            2.26.8.6.3. The assessment shall determine the status of formal agreements with supporting
            organizations by way of Memorandums of Understanding or Agreement, Inter-Service Sup-
            port Agreements and Host Tenant Support Agreements, or other methods.
     2.26.9. Site-Specific Characteristics. Site-specific circumstances may require assessment of addi-
     tional functional areas. These additional requirements shall be as directed by the CINC, Service, and
     DoD Agency or MAJCOM creating the team and should be based on site-specific characteristics, such
     as terrorism threat level, terrorist characteristics, geography and security environment.
     2.26.10. Team Composition and Level of Expertise. As a minimum, assessment team composition
     and level of expertise must support the functional areas assessed. Team membership shall have exper-
     tise in the following areas: physical security; civil, electrical or structural engineering; special opera-
     tions; operational readiness; law enforcement and medical operations; infrastructure; intelligence/
     counterintelligence, information management, and civil engineer readiness for consequence manage-
     ment. In exceptional cases, commanders may be required to tailor team composition and scope of the
     assessment to meet unique requirements of a particular installation/activity, but must meet the intent
     of a comprehensive assessment.
        2.26.10.1. Force Protection Integrated Support Team (FIST). Based on site-specific factors such
        as a Terrorism Threat Level, terrorist characteristics, geography or emergent force protection chal-
        lenges, specialized assessment teams may be commissioned with expertise to address a com-
        mander’s force protection posture. One such team is the AFSFC’s Force protection Integrated
        Support Team. The FIST is charged to mitigate or solve emergent USAF-wide AT/FP require-
        ments. Team expertise may include: AT technology; explosive ordinance disposal; communica-
        tions; information assurance or operations and other specialties as determined by the CINC,
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                 49


     Service, DoD Agency or MAJCOM sponsoring the assessment. Requests for FIST support should
     pass through command channels to HQ AFSFC/SFP, DSN 473-0896, or through the 24-hour
     AFSFC Operations Center, DSN 473-0960.
  2.26.11. HQ AFSFC shall disseminate lessons learned, trends and best practices to MAJCOMs for
  their use and further dissemination.
  2.26.11. (ACC) Installation ATOs shall document lessons learned and innovative practices via
  VAMP.
  2.26.12. Air Force units will use the Air Force Vulnerability Assessment Management Program
  (VAMP) to comply with DoD tracking and report requirements. VAMP is a web-based program
  accessed through the SIPRNET. HQ Air Force Security Forces Center, Force Protection Division
  (AFSPC/SFP) is the VAMP Program Manager. MAJCOMs and installations will appoint VAMP
  Administrators and notify AFSFC/SFP of the appointee.
     2.26.12.1. (Added-ACC) For the MAJCOM review process, the VAG will review base-level
     VAMP inputs and report discrepancies, trends, and concerns to the FPWG.
  2.26.13. The Air Force VA Guide is the source document for all Air Force (local, MAJCOM & AF)
  VAs. Vulnerabilities identified during the VA outbrief are to be entered into VAMP NLT 10 duty days
  after the VA outbrief. Observations, concerns, and best practices identified by the VA team will be
  entered into VAMP NLT 30 duty days following the receipt of the final VA report.
  2.26.14. A color-coded rating scheme will be used by MAJCOM and installations to give visibility to
  vulnerabilities and to facilitate tracking of corrective actions. Following the receipt of a DoD, AF,
  MAJCOM or local VA report, the installation commander must determine the baseline color-code rat-
  ing using the Critical Program Requirements listed in 2.26.14. Failure to achieve a “GO” rating in any
  of the Critical Program Requirement areas will result in an overall “Red” rating.
     2.26.14.1. The color-code denotes an installation or agency’s overall assessment status: Red - AT/
     FP practices and procedures do not adequately address the current local threat level; AMBER -
     AT/FP practices and procedures are marginally acceptable given the current local threat level;
     GREEN - AT/FP practices and procedures are satisfactory given the current local threat level.
     2.26.14.2. Those installations that commanders have assessed as RED will require a reassessment
     with six months after the original assessment. The appropriate HHQ will determine the type and
     scope of assessment required. If the vulnerabilities identified, that drove the RED rating, can’t be
     corrected at the time of the reassessment, the appropriate HHQ will be notified and will determine
     if a HHQ assessment is required for that location. Once the identified vulnerability areas have
     been corrected, commanders will reevaluate their installation’s AT/FP readiness and assign a new
     color-rating.
  2.26.15. There are nine Critical Program Requirements which all installations and agencies must
  meet to satisfy the basic AT/FP program standards promulgated by DoD. The nine standards are:
  2.26.15. (ACC) The installation commander will certify that their AT plan meets each of the critical
  program requirements outlined in AFI 10-245, paragraph 2.26.15. Provide a copy of your wings AT

2.27. DoD Standard 27 - Pre-deployment AT Vulnerability Assessment. DoD Components shall
ensure the execution of pre-deployment AT VA prior to deployment. At the theater level, Component
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                   51


Commanders shall provide onboard and/or advance-site assessments prior to and during visits to
higher-threat areas of Significant or High Threat Levels, or where a geographically specific Terrorism
Warning Report is in effect. This includes ports, airfields and inland movement routes that may be used by
transiting forces. At the discretion of the geographic CINC, such security efforts may be waived for
deployments and/or visits to controlled locations such as existing military installations or ships afloat.
Augmentation of assessment personnel may be necessary to enable Component Commanders to discharge
their responsibility to provide security, surveys and assessments, counterintelligence and countersurveil-
lance support and to act as the liaison with the country team, host nation security force, husbanding con-
tractor and port authority. Such advance-site deployment would also be able to communicate current local
threat information to transiting units, enabling the onboard AT team to more effectively tailor measures to
the specific threat environment.
   2.27.1. Deploying commanders shall implement appropriate AT measures to reduce risk and vulnera-
   bility. Commanders shall direct implementation of AT measures that reduce risks before, during and
   after deployment. Assessments and the subsequent implementation of standards must occur in a
   timely manner and should be incorporated in pre-deployment planning and training. Pre-deployment
   assessments should assist commanders in updating AOR-specific training and in obtaining necessary
   physical security materials and equipment to implement protective measures.
       2.27.1.1. If warranted, commanders faced with emergent AT and force protection requirements
       prior to movement of forces, should submit CbTRIF requests through established channels to pro-
       cure necessary materials or equipment for required protective measures.
       2.27.1.2. Equipment and technology can significantly enhance all DoD forces, but in particular
       the transiting units’ posture against terrorist threats. For this reason, component commanders
       should research and identify AT equipment or technology requirements to their chain of com-
       mand. The use of commercial-off-the shelf or government-off-the-shelf products should be
       stressed to meet near-term requirements.
   2.27.2. The senior deploying commander will ensure a pre-deployment VA has been conducted and a
   counterintelligence threat assessment provided by AFOSI prior to deployment. The assessment team
   will include medical members qualified to conduct site selection evaluations to include: vulnerability
   of local food and water sources, medical threats, , local medical capabilities, vector/pest risk assess-
   ment, field sanitation and of hygiene of local billeting and public facilities, and environmental risk
   assessment. Assessments will provide the necessary background data for sizing the force protection
   package required to reduce the threat to Air Force personnel and assets. MAJCOMs will determine the
   expertise level for persons conducting these assessments.
   2.27.3. Servicing AFOSI detachments will provide a threat assessment for any deployments to the
   supported installation
   2.27.4. The command intelligence officer will ensure the commander and key unit personnel possess
   appropriate sensitive compartmented information (SCI) clearances and have access to communica-
   tions to receive urgent threat information at the deployed location.

2.28. DoD Standard 28 - Construction Considerations. DoD Components shall adopt and adhere to
common criteria and minimum construction (i.e., new construction, renovation, or rehabilitation) stan-
dards to mitigate AT vulnerabilities and terrorist threats.
52                         AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


     2.28.1. The Air Force Civil Engineer (AF/ILE) shall develop construction guidelines IAW DoD
     O-2000.12-H. The guidelines shall cover antiterrorism planning, design, refurbishment and construc-
     tion (MILCON) of all Air Force facilities to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force personnel to terrorist
     attacks. At a minimum, they will meet the 16 Dec 99 Interim DoD AT/FP Construction Standards.
     2.28.2. Developing facilities that provide a safe and secure living and working environment, in poten-
     tially hostile areas, shall be a primary consideration in the planning, programming and design of Air
     Force facilities. Analysis conducted during the planning and programming phases will include assess-
     ing potential threats, reviewing design opportunities and constraints, and integrating protective strate-
     gies in the facility and its immediate surroundings.
        2.28.2.1. Installation commanders shall ensure all new construction projects and applicable reno-
        vation projects, regardless of the funding source, employ AT features and meet minimum DoD AT
        Construction Standards.
        2.28.2.2. Construction of temporary/expeditionary structures. For temporary and expeditionary
        discussions refer to Air Force Handbook 10-222, Volume 3. Commanders are also expected to use
        expeditionary measures commensurate with the identified FPCON.
        2.28.2.3. The Base Civil Engineer shall coordinate security requirements with the installation
        ATO on all facility construction and rehabilitation projects to ensure compliance with AT criteria
        and resource protection/AFOSI input/coordination. The installation ATO shall ensure all facility
        related AT/FP enhancements (i.e., fences, bollards, barriers, barricades, etc.) funded by the AT/FP
        program funds are coordinated with the Base Civil Engineer and MAJCOM CE. At a minimum,
        these efforts should be documented on an Air Force Form 332, Civil Engineer Work Request.
            2.28.2.3.1. All waivers to this criteria will be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be
            approved by HQ/ILEC.

2.29. DoD Standard 29 - Facility and Site Evaluation and/or Selection Criteria. Commanders shall
develop a prioritized list of AT factors for site selection teams. These criteria shall be used to determine if
facilities, either currently occupied or under consideration for occupancy by DoD personnel, can ade-
quately protect occupants against terrorism attack. Circumstances may require the movement of DoD per-
sonnel or assets to facilities the US government has not previously used or surveyed. AT standards should
be a key consideration in evaluating the suitability of these facilities for use.
     2.29.1. The servicing AFOSI detachment, medical, intelligence, security forces and civil engineers,
     as a minimum, will participate in the site selection process.

2.30. DoD Standard 30 - AT Guidance for Off-Installation Housing. Commanders shall ensure DoD
personnel assigned to Moderate, Significant or High Terrorist Threat Level areas, who are not provided
on-installation or other government quarters, are furnished guidance on the selection of private residences
to mitigate risk of terrorist attack. The best protection for individuals is an awareness of the threat and the
willingness to take steps necessary to reduce threat exposure.
2.30. (ACC) DoD Standard 30 - AT Guidance for Off-Installation Housing. Residential security reviews
for off-installation housing will be based on the local threat assessment/level, not the national threat
assessment.
     2.30.1. Residential Security Reviews for Off-Installation Housing. Commanders, in Significant or
     High Terrorist Threat Level areas, shall conduct physical security reviews of off-installation resi-
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                     53


   dences for permanently assigned and temporary-duty DOD personnel. Such reviews shall use the
   same terrorism threat, risk and vulnerability criteria as that used to assess the safety and security of
   occupants of other facilities or installations housing DoD personnel for which they have AT responsi-
   bility.
       2.30.1.1. Such reviews shall be conducted at least annually.
       2.30.1.2. Based on the review results, commanders shall provide AT recommendations to resi-
       dents and facility owners, facilitate additional mitigating measures, and as appropriate, recom-
       mend to appropriate authorities the construction of on-installation housing or lease of housing in
       safer areas.
   2.30.2. Commanders shall complete residential security reviews, in Significant or High Terrorist
   Threat Level areas, prior to personnel entering into formal contract negotiations for the lease or pur-
   chase of off-installation housing. Residences overseas are more apt to install security enhancements
   prior to the entering into a contract.
       2.30.2.1. Installation commanders will develop procedures through their local AFOSI, security
       forces, and civil engineer housing flights to ensure personnel are provided guidance on housing
       selection in areas with Moderate, Significant or High Terrorist Threat Levels. This guidance pro-
       vides information as to selection of homes to minimize the risk of terrorist acts.
   2.30.3. Installation commanders assigned to Low or Moderate Terrorist Threat Level areas will eval-
   uate the need to conduct assessments of off-installation housing areas.
   2.30.4. Use the VA process outlined in paragraph 2.26. to ensure proper assessment of off-installation
   housing, if deemed necessary.
   2.30.5. Commanders shall include coverage of private residential housing in AT plans where private
   residential housing must be used in Moderate, Significant or High Terrorist Threat Level areas.
   2.30.6. The best protection for individuals is an awareness of the threat and the willingness to take the
   steps necessary to reduce threat exposure. Proper selection of private residences can help reduce per-
   sonnel threat exposure.
   2.30.7. Commanders, at all levels, should incorporate family member and dependent vulnerabilities
   into all AT assessment, mitigation and reporting tools. In Moderate, Significant or High Threat areas,
   commanders shall include coverage of facilities (i.e., DoD schools and child development centers)
   and transportation services and routes (i.e., bus routes) used by DoD employees and their family
   members.

2.31. DoD Standard 31 - Executive Protection and High Risk Personnel Security. C o m m a n d e r s
shall be familiar with treaty, statutory, policy, regulatory and local constraints on the application of sup-
plemental security measures for certain high-ranking DoD officials whom are entitled to additional pro-
tection as a result of their position. Commanders shall take measures necessary to provide appropriate
protective services for such individuals in high-risk billets and high-risk personnel. Review and revalida-
tion of protective services shall occur on at least an annual basis.
   2.31.1. Commanders should ensure individuals requesting supplemental security measures are aware
   of constraints and understand their individual responsibilities in accepting additional security mea-
   sures. Commanders should ensure individuals receiving supplemental security measures have com-
54                        AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


     pleted AT training, are cleared for assignment to billets, facilities or countries requiring such
     protection, and have been thoroughly briefed on the duties of protective service personnel.
     2.31.2. Reviews of supplemental security needs should be undertaken within 30 days of a change in
     the Terrorism Threat Level assigned to an AOR containing high-risk billets or to which high-risk per-
     sonnel have been assigned.
     2.31.3. HQ AFOSI provides special AT training including the Protective Service Operation/AT Train-
     ing Course, Senior Officer Security Seminar and defensive driving courses. AFOSI also provides
     security advisory services and protective service operations for designated high-risk personnel based
     on threat.

2.32. Associated Standards from DoD O-2000.12-H. Table A2.1. In Attachment 2 associates stan-
dards from this instruction with the existing DoD O-2000.12-H. Use this handbook as guidance to imple-
ment the installation AT program.
     2.32.1. (Added-ACC) Commanders should consider implementing a staggered duty hour reporting
     plan during higher FPCONs and include it in the base AT plan. The installation manpower office, in
     consultation with the civilian personnel office, shall conduct a study on how best to stagger reporting
     times and lunch hours to minimize traffic flow problems.
     2.32.2. (Added-ACC) All units (detachments, squadrons, and groups) will develop unit-specific
     FPCON actions in checklist format to support the base AT plan and provide FP for unit members. The
     unit checklist will be attached to the installation AT plan, Appendix A, Annex C, Tab E.
2.33. (Added-ACC) AT/ Recognition Program Awards. ACC will follow the same AT award programs
as used by DoD and HQ USAF. HQ ACC/SF will forward specific details and a notification message for
annual award submissions to ACC units each year.
     2.33.1. (Added-ACC) ACC annual AT award winners will receive a memorandum of congratulations
     and a plaque, trophy, or coin as a testimonial to their outstanding AT accomplishments. Awards
     should be presented at an appropriate ceremony.
     2.33.2. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC/SF will forward all winning packages to the AFSFC for inclusion in
     the Air Force competition.

Terms
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property to
terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military forces. Also called AT. (Joint
Pub 1-02)
Antiterrorism Officer/NCO (ATO)—The installation , base, regional, facility, or deploying AT advisor
charged with managing the AT Program. He/she shall be a graduate of an approved Level II Course and
be identified in writing by the installation and/or force commander.
Antiterrorism Plan (AT Plan)—An AT Plan is the specific measures taken to establish and maintain an
AT Program.
Antiterrorism Program Element 28047F—Includes manpower authorization, antiterrorism equipment,
procurement, military construction and the associated costs specifically identified and measurable to
those resources and activities associated with the Air Force Antiterrorism Program.
Combating Terrorism—Combating terrorism within the DoD encompasses all actions, including
antiterrorism (defensive measures taken to reduce vulnerability to terrorist acts), counterterrorism
(offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism), terrorism consequence
management (preparation for and response to the consequences of a terrorist incident/event), and
intelligence support (collection and dissemination of terrorism-related information) taken to oppose
terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum, to include terrorist use of chemical, biological,
radiological, nuclear materials or high-yield explosive devices (CBRNE).
Counterintelligence—Information gathered and activities conducted to protect against espionage, other
intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassinations conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or
elements thereof, foreign organizations, or foreign persons or international terrorist activities. Also called
CI. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Counterintelligence Analysis—CI analysis is the function of assimilating, evaluating, and interpreting
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                    59


information about areas of CI prepotency and responsibility. Information derived from all available
sources is considered and integrated in the analytical process.
Counterintelligence Collection—The systematic acquisition of information (through investigations,
operations, or liaison) concerning espionage, sabotage, terrorism, other intelligence activities or
assassinations conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign
organizations, or foreign person.
Counterintelligence Investigation—Counterintelligence investigations establish the elements of proof
for prosecution or administrative action. Counterintelligence investigations can provide a basis for or be
developed from conducting counterintelligence operations. Counterintelligence investigations are
conducted against individuals or groups suspected of committing acts of espionage, sabotage, sedition,
subversion, terrorism, and other major security violations as well as failure to follow defense agency and
Military Service directives governing reporting of contacts with foreign citizens and “out-of-channel”
requests for defense information. Counterintelligence investigations provide military commanders and
policy makers with information used to eliminate security vulnerabilities and otherwise to improve the
security posture of threatened interests.
Counterintelligence Operation—Actions taken against foreign intelligence services to counter
espionage and other clandestine intelligence activities damaging to the national security.
Counterintelligence Production—The process of analyzing all source information concerning
espionage or other multidiscipline intelligence collection threats, sabotage, terrorism, and other related
threats to US military commanders, the Department of Defense, and the US Intelligence Community and
developing it into a final product that is disseminated. Counterintelligence production is used in
formulating security policy, plans, and operations.
Counterintelligence Support—Conducting counterintelligence activities to protect against espionage
and other foreign intelligence activities, sabotage, international terrorist activities or assassinations
conducted for, or on behalf of, foreign powers, organizations or persons. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Countersurveillance—All measures, active or passive, taken to counteract hostile surveillance.
Counterterrorism (CT)—Offensive measures taken to prevent, deter and respond to terrorism. Also
called CT. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Deterrence —The prevention from action by fear of the consequences. Deterrence is a state of mind
brought about by the existence of a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction. (Joint Pub 1-02)
DoD Designated High Physical Threat Countries—Countries determined to be of significant terrorist
threat to DoD travelers, as designated by the ASD(SO/LIC), in coordination with the Assistant Secretary
of Defense for International Security Affairs (ASD(ISA)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Policy (ASD(ISP)). (DoDD 2000.12)
DoD Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAM) Program—Random, multiple security measures that
consistently change the look of an installation's force protection program. RAMs introduce uncertainty to
an installation's overall force protection program to defeat surveillance attempts and make it difficult for
a terrorist to accurately predict our actions.
Environmental Threat Assessment—Multimedia medical assessment for biological, chemical, physical
and radiological hazards at an established installation or at a deployment site.
Food and Water Vulnerability—The susceptibility to overt/covert attack of food and water assets or
60                       AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


sources that could cause incapacitation or death of personnel.
Force Protection—Commander’s program designed to protect Service members, civilian employees,
family members, facilities, information and equipment, in all locations and situations, accomplished
through planned and integrated application of combating terrorism, physical security, operations security,
personal protective services and supported by intelligence, counterintelligence and other security
programs. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs)—A DoD-approved system standardizing the DoD and
Military Services’ identification of and recommended preventive actions and responses to terrorist threats
against US personnel and facilities. The system is the principle means for a commander to apply an
operational decision on how to protect against terrorism and facilitates inter-Service coordination and
support for antiterrorism activities. Also called FPCONs. There are four FPCONs above normal:
FPCON NORMAL—This condition applies when a general global threat of possible terrorist activity
exists and warrants a routine security posture.
FPCON ALPHA—This condition applies when there is an increased general threat of possible terrorist
activity against personnel or facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable, and
circumstances do not justify full implementation of FPCON BRAVO measures. However, it may be
necessary to implement certain measures from higher FPCONs measures resulting from intelligence
received or as a deterrent. The measures in this FPCONs must be capable of being maintained
indefinitely.
FPCON BRAVO—This condition applies when an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist
activity exists. The measures in this FPCON must be capable of being maintained for weeks without
causing undue hardship, affecting operational capability and aggravating relations with local authorities.
FPCON CHARLIE—This condition applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received
indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely.
Implementation of measures in this FPCON for more than a short period probably creates hardship and
affects the peacetime activities of the unit and its personnel.
FPCON DELTA—Applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has occurred or when
intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a specific location or person is imminent.
Normally, this FPCON is declared as a localized condition. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Force Protection Integrated Support Team (FIST)—The FIST is a dedicated team tasked to respond
to a MAJCOM’s or installation commander’s request to mitigate or solve emergent USAF-wide AT issues
that cannot be resolved internally.
Force Protection Working Group (FPWG) —The FPWG is the commander ’s cross-functional
working group made up of wing and tenant units. Working group members are responsible for
coordinating and providing deliberate planning for all antiterrorism/force protection issues. The FPWG
should include representatives from relevant disciplines across the installation, including civil
engineering, intelligence, AFOSI, security forces, public health, bioenvironmental, disaster preparedness,
plans, communications and other agencies the installation commander deems necessary, including tenant
units
Foreign Intelligence—Information relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign powers,
organizations, or persons, but not including counterintelligence, except for information on international
terrorist activities.

Forensic Sciences Consultant—AFOSI special agents who receive thorough graduate-level training in
most aspects of the forensic sciences and further specialization in a variety of forensic areas, to include
Federal Bureau of Investigations post-bomb blast investigations. These specially trained agents provide
support ranging from reviewing major investigation and advising on the use of specialized forensic
techniques, to providing on-scene operational assistance in investigations.
High-Risk Billet (Position)—Authorized personnel billet (identified and recommended by appropriate
authority) that because of grade, assignment, travel itinerary or symbolic value may make those personnel
filling them an especially attractive or accessible terrorist target.
High-Risk Personnel—Personnel who, by their grade, assignment, symbolic value or relative isolation,
are likely to be attractive or accessible terrorist targets. (Joint Pub 1-02)
High-Risk Targets—US material resources and facilities that, because of mission sensitivity, ease of
access, isolation and symbolic value may be an especially attractive or accessible terrorist target.
Installation Commanders may designate other US facilities such as clubs, lodging, dormitories, base
exchanges, commissaries, passenger terminals, medical facilities, and DoD schools as high-risk targets
because they concentrate large numbers of US personnel. This category is for use in local planning and
does not require reporting to HQ USAF.
Hostage—A person held as a pledge that certain terms or agreements be kept. (The taking of hostages is
forbidden under the Geneva Conventions, 1949). (Joint Pub 1-02)
Improvised Explosive Device (IED)—A device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner
incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy,
incapacitate, harass, or distract. It may incorporate military stores, but is normally devised from
nonmilitary components. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Installation—A grouping of facilities, located in the same vicinity, which support particular functions.
Installations may be elements of a base. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Installation Commander—The individual responsible for all operations performed by an installation.

knowledge about an adversary obtained through observation, investigation, analysis or understanding.
(Joint Pub 1-02)
Medical Intelligence—That category of intelligence resulting from collection, evaluation, analysis and
interpretation of foreign medical, bio-scientific and environmental information which is of interest to
strategic planning and to military medical planning and operations for the conservation of the fighting
strength of friendly forces and the formation of assessments of foreign medical capabilities in both
military and civilian sectors. Also called MEDINT.
Personal Force Health Protection—Pre-deployment countermeasures to medical threats, provided by
the commander.
Physical Security—That part of security concerned with physical measures designed to safeguard
personnel; to prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to
safeguard them against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. (Joint Pub 1-02)

62                        AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003


to harden targets and detect actions before they occur. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Protective Services—A specialized AFOSI activity which increases the personal safety and security of
distinguished visitor or other protectee. The activity may be limited to protective threat assessment or may
extend to a major protective service operation involving considerable manpower and resources ( AFI
71-101, Vol. 2).
Protective Service Operation (PSO)—The use of specialized techniques and procedures by AFOSI
personnel to ensure a protectee’s personal safety and security during a specific event, while traveling, or
over an extended period of time. When required, a PSO can be tailored to provide 24-hour protection. In
such cases, the security detail establishes defensive overt or clandestine perimeters around the protectee
for the term of the PSO at the residence, during travel, and at all sites on the protectee’s daily itinerary.
(AFI 71-101, Vol 2)
Protective Threat Assessment (PTA)—Collecting and analyzing information to identify direct any
potential threats to harm, seize, interfere with, or embarrass a specific protectee, as well as to determine
the existing and anticipated security environment. A PTA is always the initial phase of a PSO. (AFI
71-101, Vol 2)
Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA)—An agreement which defines the legal position of a visiting
military force deployed in the territory of a friendly state. Agreements delineating the status of visiting
military forces may be bilateral or multilateral. Provisions pertaining to the status of visiting forces may
be set forth in a separate agreement, or they may form a part of a more comprehensive agreement. These
provisions describe how the authorities of a visiting force may control members of that force and the
amenability of the force or its members to the local law or to the authority of local officials. To the extent
that agreements delineate matters affecting the relations between a military force and civilian authorities
and population, they may be considered as civil affairs agreements. Also called SOFA. (Joint Pub 1-02)

protect public health and safety; and restore emergency essential government services.
Terrorism Threat Analysis—In antiterrorism, threat analysis is a continual process of compiling and
examining all available information concerning potential terrorist activists by groups that could target a
facility. A threat analysis will review factors of the presence of a terrorist group, operational capability,
activity, intentions and operating environment.
Terrorism Threat Assessment—The process used to conduct a threat analysis and develop an evaluation
of a potential terrorist threat and the product of a threat analysis for a particular unit, installation or
activity.
Terrorist—An individual who uses violence, terror and intimidation to achieve a result. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Terrorist Groups—Any element, regardless, of size or espoused cause, that commits acts of violence or
threatens violence in pursuit of its political, religious or ideological objectives. (Joint Pub 1-02)
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                    63


Terrorist Incident Response Measures—A set of procedures in place for response forces to deal with
the effects of a terrorist incident.
Threat and Vulnerability Assessment (VA)—In antiterrorism, the pairing of a facility’s threat analysis
and vulnerability analysis. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Threat Working Group (TWG) —TWGs are an AT/FP advisory body for the commander. Key
functions include analyzing threats and providing recommendations to command concerning potential
FPCON changes, AT and other measures based upon potential threats to facilities or personnel. Core
membership, should include at a minimum, the ATO, AFOSI, Intelligence Office, Medical Intelligence
Officer, Chief of Security Forces and other agencies as required by the installation commander.
Vulnerability—(1) The susceptibility of a nation or military force to any action by any means through
which its war potential or combat effectiveness may be reduced or its will to fight diminished. (2) The
characteristics of a system that cause it to suffer a definite degradation (incapability to perform the
designated mission) as a result of having been subjected to a certain level of effects in an unnatural
(manmade) hostile environment. (3) In information operations, a weakness in information system security
design, procedures, implementation, or internal controls that could be exploited to gain unauthorized
access to information systems.
Vulnerability Assessment—A Department of Defense, command, or unit-level evaluation (assessment)
to determine the vulnerability of a terrorist attack against an installation, unit, exercise, port, ship,
residence, facility, or other site. Identifies areas of improvement to withstand, mitigate, or deter acts of
violence or terrorism.
Weapons Of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Weapons that are capable of a high order of destruction and/
or of being used in such a manner as to destroy large numbers of people. Weapons of mass destruction can

               FORCE PROTECTION CONDITIONS (FPCONS) AND MEASURES

A3.1. The FPCONs listed below describe progressive levels of terrorist threats to US military facilities
and personnel. As DoD and Service’s-approved terminology, these terms, definitions and security mea-
sures are intended to facilitate interservice coordination and support of US military antiterrorism and
force protection activities. Selection of the appropriate response to terrorist threats remains the responsi-
bility of the commander having jurisdiction or control over the threatened facilities or personnel. Com-
manders are responsible for ensuring measures tailored to their specific installation are developed
commensurate with the appropriate FPCON level. A FPCON Individual Reference Card is available at
https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/

A3.2. FPCON NORMAL: Commanders employ Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs) during this
and all FPCONs to enhance force protection.

                                                  Attachment 4

                                      TERRORIST THREAT LEVELS

A4.1. The purpose of this attachment is to provide commanders and other consumers of terrorist threat
assessments a definition of terrorist threat levels and a description of the factors used to assign a threat
level in a given country.

A4.2. In assessing the terrorist threat to US personnel and interests, DoD intelligence agencies use a
four-step scale to describe the severity of the threat. These threat levels are established by DIA and the
geographic CINCs and only apply to assessments of the terrorist threat to DoD interests. The following
lists the threat levels and the combinations of analysis-based factors used to determine the level:
     A4.2.1. HIGH. Anti-US terrorists are operationally active and uses large casualty producing attacks
     (WMD) as their preferred method of operation. There is a substantial DoD presence and the operating
     environment favors the terrorist.
     A4.2.2. SIGNIFICANT: Anti-US terrorists are present and attack personnel as their preferred
     method of operation or a group uses large casualty producing attacks (WMD) as their preferred
     method but has limited operational activity. The operating environment is neutral.
     A4.2.3. MODERATE: Terrorists are present but there are no indications of anti-US activity. The
     operating environment favors the Host Nation/US.
     A4.2.4. LOW: No group is detected or the group activity is non-threatening.

A4.3. Terrorist threat levels are a product of the following four factors:
     A4.3.1. OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. This factor focuses on the attack methods used by the
     group and other measures that enhance its effectiveness, such as state sponsorship and ingenious use
     of technology. The key element is whether the group has the capability and willingness to conduct
     large casualty producing attacks, for example a suicide vehicle bomb containing thousand of kilo-
     grams of explosives or WMD timed to kill the most personnel at the target. Groups that selectively
     assassinate individuals or conduct late night bombings causing limited property damage pose a
     decreasing threat. The ability to operate on a regional or transnational basis and the overall profession-
     alism of the group is also assessed.
     A4.3.2. INTENTIONS. This factor is the stated desire or history of terrorist attacks against US
     interests. Recent substantial attacks in the country or, if the group is transnational, the conduct of oper-
     ations in other countries is the higher end of the threat scale. This is especially true if the intentions are
     anti-DoD. The basis of the group ideology, whether the group is more focused on the host nation
     rather than US interests is the other key component. Whether the group will react to high profile US
     led international events, such as intervention in the Balkans, is also considered and rated.
     A4.3.3. ACTIVITY. This factor is an assessment of the actions the group is conducting and whether
     that activity is focused on serious preparations for an attack. The highest threat is credible indications
     of US targeting to include the movement of key operatives, final intelligence collection and move-
     ment of weapons to the target vicinity. Less threatening actions are contingency planning, training,
     and logistical support. Activities that would make the group less likely to attack, such as robust fund
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                      71


   raising or effective safe haven are considered. Whether the group has recently been disrupted by
   arrests or strikes on training camps will reduce the threat, at least in the short term.
   A4.3.4. OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. This factor rates how the overall environment influences
   the ability, opportunity and motivation to attack DoD interests in a given location. An important ele-
   ment of this factor is the capability of the host nation security apparatus to combat terrorism, its
   degree of cooperation with the US and the quality of the reporting on terrorist groups in the country.
   A key element is whether there is a DoD presence and if so the type, size, location, political sensitivity
   and if temporary, its duration. It is also important to consider if the group is focused on DoD as its pri-
   mary target for anti-US attacks. Another part of this factor is the overall political, economic and mili-
   tary stability of the country and its effect on the ability of a group to attack.

A4.4. DIA and the responsible geographic CINC may assign different threat levels to the same country.
This is possible because analysts occasionally disagree about the conclusions to be drawn from the avail-
able information. A4.5. Threat assessments provide information to assist commanders in determining the
appropriate FPCONs. FPCON declarations remain the exclusive responsibility of commanders. Threat
levels are not tied to FPCONs in any way, and should not be confused. National-level DoD organizations
cannot provide all intelligence that might be needed to make FPCONs determinations. Information from
regional and tactical intelligence, and local law enforcement authorities must also be considered.

A4.5. Threat assessments are not to be confused with DoD-designated high physical threat countries.
DoD-designated high physical threat countries pertain exclusively to the DoD Travel Security Policy.

A6.1. Vulnerability assessments assist installation commanders in meeting their AT responsibilities and
should be viewed as a commander’s tool to identify vulnerabilities and options (procedural and technical)
to reduce the potential impact of terrorist attacks. The focus of VAs is on the protection of Department of
Defense (DoD) personnel and their family members. To best support the installation commander, close
coordination between the Vulnerability Assessment Team (VAT) and the commander’s staff is necessary.
Prior to the VAT’s arrival, a message detailing the VAT'’s requirements will be sent to the unit being
assessed.

1. SITUATION:
         a. General. (This plan applies to all personnel assigned or attached to the installation. Describe
the political/military environment in sufficient detail for subordinate commanders, staffs, and units to
understand their role in the installation AT operations.)
         b. Enemy. (The enemy is any adversary capable of threatening the installation's personnel, facil-
ities, and equipment. Enter the general threat of terrorism, including transnational, to this installation
including; the intentions and capabilities, identification, composition, disposition, location, and estimated
strengths of hostile forces. Include the general threat of terrorist use of WMD against this installation.
This information should remain unclassified when possible. See paragraph 1f, Intelligence, on identify-
ing specific threats. This information may be included as a separate Annex.) See Annex B (Intelligence).
         c. Friendly. (Enter the forces available, both military and civilian, to respond to a terrorist attack.
Include the next higher headquarters and adjacent installations, and any units/organizations that are not
under installation command, but may be required to respond to such an incident. These units/organiza-
tions may include HN and US military police forces, fire and emergency services, medical, federal/state
and local agencies, special operations forces, engineers, WMD detection, EOD, and decontamination.
Include MOAs/MOUs and any other special arrangements that will improve forces available to support
the plan.) (If CONUS, the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), is responsible
for coordinating all federal agencies and DoD forces assisting in the resolution of a terrorist incident. If
OCONUS, the Department of State is the lead agency.) This information can be included as a separate
Annex(s). See Annex A (Task Organization) and Annex J (Command Relationships).

that will be needed to support this plan. Explain interagency relationships and interoperability issues.
List appropriate MOAs as necessary.) This can be listed in other Annex(s). See Annex A (Task Organi-
zation) and Annex J (Command Relationships).
        e. Assumptions. (Enter all critical planning and execution assumptions used as a basis for this
plan. Assumptions are those factors that are unlikely to change during the implementation of the AT
installation plan. Put another way, those factors that you must address to allow you to continue to plan.
They may range from troop strength on base, major political/social environment in the surrounding area,
or terrorists acquiring shoulder fired antiaircraft missiles.) Examples follow:
                 (1) The installation is vulnerable to theft, pilferage, sabotage, and other threats.
                 (2) An act of terrorism involving WMD can produce major consequences that will over-
whelm almost immediately the capabilities of the installation.
                 (3) Security personnel, both military and civilian, may be insufficient to provide total pro-
tection of all installation resources. Therefore, the principal owner or user of a facility, resource, or per-
sonnel must develop adequate unit awareness and safeguard measures.
                 (4) No single unit on the installation possesses the expertise to act unilaterally in response
to WMD attacks.
                 (5) If protective equipment is not available, responders will not put their own lives at risk.
                 (6) Local, nonmilitary response forces will arrive within (time) of notification.
                 (7) Units specializing in WMD response will arrive on-site within (number of hours based
on installation location) of notification.
        f. Intelligence. (Enter the person, staff, or unit responsible for intelligence collection and dissem-
ination. The installation commander must have a system in place to access current intelligence. The
installation should have a process in place for developing the installation's tailored threat assessment or
"local threat picture." The installation's tailored threat assessment should be continuously evaluated,
updated, and disseminated as appropriate, and as directed by the installation commander. The com-
mander should determine the frequency and the means of dissemination of the installation’s tailored AT
product.) This can be included in Annex B (Intelligence).

2. MISSION. (Enter a clear, concise statement of the command's mission and the AT purpose or goal
statement supporting the mission. The primary purpose of the AT installation plan is to safeguard person-
nel, property, and resources during normal operations. It is also designed to deter a terrorist threat; to
enhance security and AT awareness; and to assign AT responsibilities for all installation personnel.)

3. EXECUTION:
        a. Commander's Intent. (Commander's vision on how he/she sees the execution of the unit's AT
program.)
        b. Concept of Operations. (Enter how the overall AT operation should progress. This plan
stresses deterrence of terrorist incidents through preventive and response measures common to all com-
batant commands and services. During day-to-day operations, the installation should stress continuous
AT planning and passive, defensive operations. This paragraph should provide subordinates sufficient
guidance to act upon if contact or communications with the installation chain of command is lost or dis-
rupted.)

                 (1) The installation's AT concept of operations should be phased in relation to pre-incident
actions and post-incident actions utilizing the FPCON levels as a means of ramping the installation up
from FPCON NORMAL through consequence management actions. AT planning and execution requires
that staff elements work with a much greater degree of cohesiveness and unity of mission than that
required during the conduct of normal base sustainment operations. The AT mission, and the unpredict-
ability of its execution, requires very specific "how to" implementation instructions of DoD FPCON mea-
sures and in what manner these actions must be coordinated. The implementation instructions are put into
the form of action sets and can be displayed in the form of an execution matrix Pre-Incident Action Set
Matrix).
               (2) In Post-Incident planning, the installation should focus on its response and reconstitu-
tion responsibilities upon notification of a terrorist incident and the procedures for obtaining technical
assistance/augmentation if the incident exceeds the installation's organic capabilities. National level
responders (Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Red Cross, and FBI) may not be immedi-
ately accessible or available to respond to an installation's needs. Therefore, each installation must plan
for the worst-case scenario by planning its response based on its organic resources and available local
support through MOA/MOUs.
                (3) The situation may dictate that the installation not only conduct the initial response, but
also sustain response operations. This paragraph will include specific implementation instructions for all
functional areas of responsibility and the manner in which these actions must be coordinated. The imple-
mentation instructions will be put in the form of action sets and displayed in the form of a synchronization
matrix broken down by FPCONs. The synchronization matrix format must clearly describe relationships
between activities, units, supporting functions, and key events which must be carefully synchronized to
minimize loss of life and to contain the effects of a potential terrorist incident.
        c. Tasks. (Enter the specific tasks for each subordinate unit or element listed in the Task Organi-
zation paragraph. Key members of the installation have responsibilities that are AT and/or WMD spe-
cific. The commander should ensure that a specific individual/unit/element within the installation is
responsible for each action identified in this plan. Each individual/unit/element must know the tasks and
responsibilities, what these responsibilities entail, and how these will be implemented. The AT Planning
and Response Elements will be delineated in the Pre- and Post-incident Action Set Matrices. It is recom-
mended that the installation commander identify/designate the primary lead for each element and enter
that information in this paragraph.)
        d. Coordinating Instructions. (This paragraph should include AT specific coordinating instruc-
tions and subparagraphs, as the commander deems appropriate. In addition, this section of the AT plan
outlines aspects of the installation's AT posture that require particular attention to guarantee the most
effective and efficient implementation of the AT plan. For the purposes of this plan, there are five basic
coordinating instructions (1) AT Planning and Response Elements, (2) Procedural; (3) Security Posture;
(4) Threat Specific Responsibilities and (5) Special Installation Areas. The sections listed below are rep-
resentative, and may not be all-inclusive.)
                (1) AT Planning and Response. For instructional purposes, this section provides an over-
view of AT Planning and Response Elements on the installation that is required to respond to a terrorist/
WMD incident. Initial and sustained response to an attack must be a coordinated effort between the many
AT Planning and Response Elements organic to the installation, based on the installation's organic capa-
bilities. As the situation exceeds the installation's capabilities, it must activate MOAs/MOUs with the
local/state/federal agencies. For the purposes of this plan, an installation's capability is divided into AT

consolidated WMD defense equipment, expedient decontamination supplies, Individual Protective Equip-
ment exchange points, special contamination control requirements, retrograde contamination monitoring
sites, WMD equipment/supply controlled supply rates and prestockage points, and procedures for chemi-
cal defense equipment "push" packages. Specific logistics and administrative requirements will emerge
throughout the planning process outlined in the concept of operations, specifically when developing the
action sets. In summary, any logistical action to support the AT/FP plan from pre-incident through inci-
dent recovery should be addressed.)

Introduction. This guidance applies to all Air Force military, DoD civilian, and contract personnel. It
defines AT/FP procedures for all squadron personnel as well as reinforcing the SJAFB, ACC, AF, and
DoD programs. The combined programs are designed to deter terrorist acts against personnel and
resources by providing timely guidance on collecting and disseminating threat information. In addition,
the squadron program builds terrorism awareness and provides specific "how to" guidance.
Responsibilities. {YOUR UNIT HERE} is responsible for the {add all buildings and sections that apple
to your unit here}. The {designate a section, not individual to do this in the event of leave TDY etc}
ensures FPCON signs are posted in these buildings upon notification of a FPCON change. As a courtesy,
the AT/FP monitor notifies {any outside agencies} of increased FPCONs. In addition, the AT/FP monitor
ensures the Unit/CC procedures outlined in the 4th Fighter Wing Installation Security Plan and Antiterror-
ism plan are implemented. (NOTE: Identify a section not individuals to implement portion of this plan.
What if the individual is on leave? At least in a section, there is more than one person who can carry out
this task)
Vulnerability Assessments (VA). The AT/FP monitor will perform VAs annually in coordination with the
wing Antiterrorism Officer. The wing AT Officer will detail information for this requirement as it
becomes due. Upon completion of the VA, the commander and unit AT monitor will review and identify
any areas under their control and coordinate with the wing ATO for mitigation efforts.
Ancillary Training Requirements. All personnel, military, DoD civilians, and contractors are required
to have Level I AT/FP training annually. Air Force personnel will receive a threat brief within three
months of any deployment, leave, or travel outside the continental United States. Contractors and depen-
dents should be encouraged to receive the briefing if they would like before leaving the CONUS for any
reason. The AT/FP monitor will maintain a record of trained individuals and provide a copy of the record
to the Unit Ancillary Training Manager. IAW AFI 10-245, The Air Force Antiterrorism/Force Protection
Program Standards, AT/FP training will be documented in MILPDS or through normal ancillary records
if documenting the training cannot be done through MILPDS. The Unit Training Manager will ensure this
requirement is met as well as ensuring the training is documented. The Unit Deployment Manager will
contact the AT/FP monitor or Unit Training Monitor to ensure personnel going TDY have received the
training prior to departure. The AT/FP monitor will submit training statistics to 4 FW/XP NLT the last Fri-
day of each month using the format in Attachment 11(Added-SEYMOUR JOHNSON) of SJAFB Sup-
plement 1 to AFI 1--245.
Random Antiterrorism Measures. Unpredictability is the key to deterring terrorist attacks. To maintain
unpredictability RAMs must be incorporated at varying times during all FPCONs. Each unit should
develop a RAM program. RAMs are measures taken from a higher FPCON and applied to a lower
FPCON. Units may develop their own RAMs in a checklist format as an attachment to their OI. If a unit
develops a unique RAM due to it’s mission, coordinate with the wing ATO. You must as a minimum use
the 7 listed below for FPCON Alpha. Each FPCON will requires a RAM checklist and RAMs to be con-
ducted from the next higher FPCON within it. Be creative and develop some of your own that your unit
can use. Each unit AT/FP monitor will ensure a minimum of two RAMs are conducted daily during the
week. For 24 hour operations, a minimum of 4 RAMs are required daily and must be accomplished
throughout all shifts. One shift will not complete all RAMs. You can rotate the responsibility of accom-
plishing the RAM by setting up a schedule like the one below. Your unit mission will dictate the best way
to fulfill this requirement. The RAM schedule is for ALL FACILITIES THAT CONTAIN OFFICES OR
WORK CENTERS. AT Monitors will insure compliance.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                               97


RAM #1: Implement random ID and hand-carried item checks at customer service entrance (Note: These
checks will be conducted for at least 30 minutes). Use the 4 FW Building Entry Control Guide to ensure
the ID checker is aware of his/her responsibilities. (Attachment 6)
RAM #2 Check the interior of storage rooms
RAM #3: Inspect exterior of office areas for suspicious packages daily.
RAM #4: Inspect vehicles for suspicious objects and /or packages.
RAM #5: Inspect contents of all items brought into office area.
RAM #6: Close all curtains and blinds for one day in random offices.
RAM #7: Conduct a walk around of the facility. Look for vehicles parked on grass or sidewalks close to
buildings. Challenge suspicious/unfamiliar people who may be wandering around facilities.


The RAM book will follow each section and a log of who conducted the RAM, when, and where it was
conducted will be annotated and filed monthly with the Unit AT/FP Monitor. This log should be main-
tained in the RAM book until the start of a new month so individuals conducting them will not complete
the same one repeatedly. Forward a copy of your RAM documentation to the Wing Antiterrorism Officer
NLT the last Friday of the month.

All unit AT/FP representatives will ensure all personnel conducting RAM are trained on how to conduct
the RAM as well as understand why they are conducting it. The training plan and instruction will be in the
RAM book. The book is for official use only.


The RAM program is designed to constantly change the security signature of the installation. In other
words, RAMs introduce uncertainty for planners and organizers of terrorist attacks. It works and is part of
the entire base defense plan. Do your part!
Battle Staff Directive (BSD) Notification. All FPCON changes are followed by a BSD. This directive is
sent to Unit CCs and Unit Control Centers (UCC) Develop a policy to ensure enough of your personnel
are on the distribution of these. Ensure personnel do not rely on e-mail as the sole source for informing
your unit of the change. Identify a section, not just a few individuals to make notifications. If you have 24/
7 operations they would be ideal to make the notification. I suggest you make a checklist with who is
tasked to make notifications and to whom. Also who will implement your parking plans and post signs for
your facility?
Bomb Threat/Suspicious Package/Letter/Unattended Item Response. We must know the difference
between a bomb threat, suspicious package/letter, and unattended item in order to communicate effec-
tively with Emergency Dispatchers. Response to each varies and is dependent upon what type of situation
it is. How you communicate can affect the way responding forces react to a situation.
Bomb Threat - Received threat (telephone, computer, letter, etc.) indicating some form of explosive
device at a given location.


Suspicious Package/Letter. Any package or letter received (mail, delivery, etc.) that meets the indicators
as described on suspicious/letter posters.


Unattended Item. Any object placed in a suspicious location with no obvious owner in the vicinity.
Bomb Threat. If you receive a phone call and a threat is given initiate an AF Form 440, Bomb Threat
Aid, located by your phone, ask every question and follow all the steps. Do not hang up the phone; it will
make it easier to trace the call. Call 911 on a different line or if using a cell phone call 722-STOP. STAY
ON THE LINE until the dispatcher gives you the okay to leave. Responding forces need you to give the
necessary information for their response.


Do not change the environment. Leave lights on if they were on, or leave them off if they were off. Do not
use electrical devices (radios, etc.) and finally evacuate the facility (Designated by the facility evacuation
plan). Ensure the evacuation point is not in close proximity to the facility. ENSURE the evacuation point
is free from objects (cars, trash containers, etc.) in case a secondary device has been placed or hidden.
All pertinent personnel (911 caller, recipient of bomb threat) need to meet the responding forces once on
scene with AF 440 information and answer any question they may have in order to effectively diffuse the
situation.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                      99


Receipt of a Suspicious Package/Envelope. Upon identification of a suspicious package, the person
receiving/finding the package must take immediate actions to protect lives.


If you receive mail and you were not expecting it or it does not look right, be careful. If any of the indica-
tors in the guide at attachment XX are present, STOP. Dial 911 and evacuate the building using the desig-
nated facility evacuation plan if you have already handled the item prior to noticing the suspicious nature,
place the item down in an area that is easily accessible. Do not place in a barrel, box, or tub of water!


Unattended Items. Is a briefcase on a desk suspicious? Usually not however, you need to ask yourself:
Where's it placed? Is there an owner in the vicinity? Does it belong to anyone in the office?


*If you feel it is suspicious, report it and use the designated facility evacuation plan.


Building Evacuation Plans. Evacuation plans are NOT the same as the fire evacuation plans. The rally
points are different (primary and Alternate on different sides of the building) for AT/FP evacuations. Tell
them how you want them to evacuate and where you want them to go. Draw a map to show them.
{Remember, if you have a suspicious package by the front door you want to make sure everyone is aware
of that fact so they will not evacuate through the front door. How will you do that? Every facility is differ-
ent so walk through your ideas, formulate a plan and go into detail in your OI!} Include the map as an
attachment to the OI. Exercise this plan so everyone can become familiar and know the difference
between a fire evacuation and an antiterrorism directed evacuation. Make sure you're far enough away,
500 feet at a minimum. Be careful not to make your rally point in an area where responding forces are
going to be such as parking lots. Also remember, you do not want your folks near dumpsters or other areas
where a second bomb could cause injury. ACCOUNT FOR YOUR PEOPLE. Describe how each section
in the building should account for their people. You don't want to leave anyone behind. The person mak-
ing the discovery of the package needs to meet with responding forces to tell them the details of the inci-
dent. All personnel need to take their personal belongings with them. Mark briefcases and other office
items normally left in the building. ID tags on gym bags and other personal items will also assist respond-
ing forces on identifying who the property belongs to. You run the risk of having your personal items
destroyed if it is deemed suspicious. Marking your bags also speeds the entire process and eliminates false
alarms.


How will you notify personnel in your facilities to evacuate? There are several ideas. Intercoms work
best. Most of us don't have them so telephone, e-mail, runner, etc can be used. Using a runner is an option
but it has its drawbacks. It takes time. Is another office in a separate building available so they can call
everyone in your building to make sure they got the word? Don't pull the fire alarm. That should be for a
fire only. Use your imagination but keep it simple. Large buildings, especially those with many different
organizations are going to have to coordinate their plans. Make sure everyone knows where to evacuate
and which route to take. Account for your people!

Parking Plans. During FPCON Bravo, the 25-meter requirement identified in FPCON Bravo, Measure
14 will be implemented. Draw a map and add as an attachment to this OI. Personnel may park in any area
not blocked off. During FPCON Charlie and Delta, the base may implement a barrier plan. Normal park-
ing may not exist. Direct where they should park based on the barrier plan. Personnel will park in the
nearest available parking area, i.e. Fitness Center, CE, Enlisted Club, etc.


Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Controls (HVAC). Each unit will identify the location of
HVAC system controls and how to shut them off in the event of a chemical or biological attack. The loca-
tion of the controls should be placed on a map of the facility to aid everyone in the unit of the location.


Individual Protective Measures (IPM) for Off-Base Personnel. Upon entering FPCON Bravo or
higher, personnel residing and traveling off base will review the Antiterrorism IPMs pamphlet and imple-
ment as many measures as possible to protect themselves and family members, if any, from becoming the
target of terrorist attack.


Posted Door Guard Responsibilities. Door guards will be aware of general information concerning the
current situation, FPCON, and post duties.
An oncoming guard will receive a status briefing from the person being relieved. The oncoming guard
will then conduct a building security check (outside walk around). The oncoming guard must report any
suspicious activities or objects.
Guards will maintain a binder that holds, as a minimum, a copy of this OI, base telephone book, building
entry control guide, and note taking material {identify where is the book located when not in use}.
Whenever possible a telephone will be posted with the guard, along with a small table, chair and flashlight
with batteries.
The guard's responsibility is to maintain security and vigilance over his/her assigned door/area. The guard
must be aware of the activities in the area, to include knowing and implementing appropriate actions.
One of the most important responsibilities during certain FPCON is to check the identification of anyone
requesting entry. Use the building entry control guide as an attachment and mandate its use.
Packages, Deliveries, and Visitors: The guard will not act as a runner or receive packages, mail, food, etc.
Anyone (sponsor) expecting a visitor or deliveries must coordinate a time/place in which to meet the vis-
itor/delivery person. The sponsor is responsible for escorting his/her guests while in the building.
When directed by a RAM, guards will search packages or other items that come into the building for
weapons, explosives, etc. The guard or package recipient will "sound the alarm" if something suspicious
is found.
NOTE: All guards should receive training on how to properly handle/search these items.


Single Point Entry. Single point entry is meant for visitors to facilities. If you use cipher locks, and have
good key control, you can use any door available. This only applies to personnel working in the facility.
Personnel CANNOT escort anyone into the building through doors other than the single point of entry.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP1_I 15 MAY 2003                                                    101


Visitors must exit through the main door. Personnel assigned to facilities can use whatever door is avail-
able. THEY MUST ENSURE IT LOCKS BEHIND THEM. If a facility has repeated problems with
securing doors behind themselves, mandate the use of the main door only.


Sheltering in place. There may be instances where you could be directed to shelter in place. If an incident
happened on the installation the safest place may be in your workplace. If directed to shelter in place close
all doors and windows, shut off ventilation systems and do not let personnel inside the facility depart the
building. Try and seal off doors and other vents with
