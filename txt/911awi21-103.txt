      6.3.1. Tires for rocks and debris.
      6.3.2. Exterior of vehicle for loose objects.
      6.3.3. Interior for objects that could fall out undetected.

   assigned to individuals or duty position (i.e. government issued headsets, flashlights, etc.)
   will be marked in accordance with AFI 21-101/AFRC SUP 1.
   6.8. In all aircraft or AGE maintenance operations, “parts bags” will be utilized as much as
   practical to secure extra or attaching hardware, work order residue, or any other potential
   FOD source. The bag will be attached to the component or part when possible and labeled
   with quantity, equipment identification, and nomenclature of part or component (i.e. 24
   screws, left wing anti-ice access panel, Aircraft 810). The intent of this instruction is not to
   label every component for identification but rather to provide a means of accurately
   accounting for common hardware and other easily misplaced items that may cause a potential
   for FOD risks.

   inspection has been accomplished by the individual who signs the “Inspected by” block of
   the AFTO Form 781A or AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record. In all
   other cases of aircraft or AGE maintenance, the technician performing the work will ensure
   that all tools, equipment, and/or work order residue are accounted for in addition to a final
   FOD inspection. Technicians who sign the “Corrected by” block of the AFTO Form 781A or
   AFTO Form 244 are responsible for this inspection.
