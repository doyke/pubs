1. Mission. The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACS) of the Air Force for Strategic
Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (AF/A10), pursuant to 10 U.S.C. §§ 8031-8038, and
as documented by paragraph 4.3.7 of AFMD 1, Headquarters Air Force, and this
Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Mission Directive, assists the Secretary of the Air Force,
other Secretariat offices, and the Chief of Staff by focusing on nuclear operations,
policy, plans, requirements, strategy guidance, integration and synchronization of USAF
nuclear enterprise and strategic deterrence (global strike, etc.) efforts inside the Air
Force and with mission partners external to the USAF (Office of the Secretary of
Defense (OSD), National Nuclear Security Administration, etc.). AF/A10 has direct
access to the SECAF and CSAF and has oversight authority to ensure uniformity of
nuclear policy, guidance, requirements and advocacy across the HAF staff and
throughout the broader nuclear enterprise. The AF/A10 is responsible for the
synchronization and integration of all nuclear-related issues across the USAF nuclear
enterprise and collaborates with Headquarters Air Force, Major Commands, other
Services, Joint Staff, OSD, and other Federal Agency mission partners to further this
nuclear focus by ensuring corporate advocacy and full spectrum stewardship of nuclear
capabilities. AF/A10 facilitates integrated nuclear enterprise solutions and maintains
synchronization in strategic deterrence responsibilities of the Department of the Air
Force. As Secretary of the Air Force, I retain ultimate responsibility for all policies
related to the Department of the Air Force. Within his or her areas of responsibility, the
AF/A10 prepares policies for my approval and issues official guidance/procedures to
ensure implementation of those policies. The AF/A10 also assists the Chief of Staff of
the Air Force in their role, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 151, as a member of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff (JCS).
2. Organizational Relationships. The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for, and
has all legal authority necessary to conduct, the affairs of the Department of the Air
Force. The Secretariat, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Air Staff offices perform
their Department of the Air Force functions subject to the authority, direction and control
of the Secretary of the Air Force.

2.1. The AF/A10 reports directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, but provides
support to the Secretary of the Air Force, the Under Secretary of the Air Force, other
Secretariat offices, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and other Air Staff offices.
The Secretary of the Air Force may re-delegate authority to the AF/A10, but the
Secretary of the Air Force, through the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and, as
appropriate, Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force, retains ultimate responsibility for all
matters affecting nuclear operations, policy, plans, requirements, strategy, guidance,
integration and synchronization of the nuclear enterprise and strategic deterrence (global
strike, etc.) efforts.

2.1.1. In the role as the Air Staff nuclear accountable officer, AF/A10 ensures the Air
Force’s commitment to the nuclear deterrence mission and its supporting elements at all
levels through activities such as: overseeing the strategic plan to address the root causes
of past problems; improving unity of command through efforts to mature Air Force
Global Strike Command, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center and AF/A10; advocating
for enterprise-wide initiatives that enhance the safety, security, reliability and deterrent
value of Air Force nuclear-related capability; integrating efforts to develop the technical
skills of Air Force personnel; reinforcing nuclear mission responsibilities by promoting
an enterprise-wide culture of compliance and precision; and, in partnership with the
Under Secretary of the Air Force’s policy oversight role, leading the development of an
integrated policy construct that enables the above activities.

2.2. The AF/A10 is part of the Air Staff and as such works closely with other HAF
offices to assist the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff in carrying out their
responsibilities. The AF/A10 and the Office of the AF/A10 work in cooperation with
other HAF officials, and their respective offices, which are responsible, pursuant to
Chapters 803 and 805 of Title 10 (10 U.S.C. §§ 8013-8023 and §§ 8031-8038), for

responsibilities.

2.2.1. Pursuant to Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 90-1, two or more HAF
two-digit organizations, Field Operating Agencies, or Direct Reporting Units with
responsibilities in the same functional area are encouraged to develop “standard
operating procedures (SoPs)” that set forth procedures enabling covered organizations to
fulfill and carry out their respective missions, roles, and responsibilities. Currently, there
are no SoPs between AF/A10 and any other organization, however, AF/A10 will initiate
SoPs as necessary for functional responsibilities shared with other organizations.
