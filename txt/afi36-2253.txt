Section A—Program Overview

1. Scope. This instruction provides guidance and policy direction of a continuing nature to create a seam-
less environment to meet the Air Force mission for those AETC and AFRC personnel involved in the
day-to-day management of the JSUPT, ENJJPT, and IFF Integrated Associate IP Program (hereinafter
called “the Program”).

2. Background. This program is designed to be a total force program that fully integrates reserve and
active duty (AD) forces to complete the flying training mission. It reflects Department of Defense (DOD)
leadership support of the total force concept. Functions include:
    2.1. Peacetime. The mission of the 340th Flying Training Group (340 FTG) and flying training
    squadrons (FTS) is to train and provide a reserve of experienced IPs to augment the AETC IP cadre in
    the event of wartime mobilization conditions. These units ensure that assigned IPs are trained and pre-
    pared to accomplish instructor duties by participating in regular flights with both reserve and AD stu-
    dent and instructor pilots.
    2.2. Wartime and Emergencies. In the event of hostilities, the reserve associate unit is mobilized to
    offset the anticipated loss of AD weapon system-qualified pilot pipeline input to AETC pilot instruc-
    tor training (PIT).

3. Concept of Operations. The program concept collocates reserve units without unit aircraft or equip-
ment with AD AETC units. These units (composed of traditional reservists [TR] and active guard and
reserve [AGR] personnel) share aircraft and other facilities of the active unit.
    3.1. Operational Control (OPCON). The host AD operations group commander exercises OPCON
    of AFRC IPs while performing flights or mission-related support duties. OPCON includes assigning
    AFRC IPs to operational positions, establishing training and curriculum standards, operating the pilot
    evaluation systems, as well as all aspects directly related to flight and student training discipline.
    Refer to AFDD 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine, for a complete description.
    3.2. Administrative Control (ADCON). ADCON remains with the reserve associate unit com-
    mander. When mobilized, AFRC personnel maintain unit identity and continue to fully integrate with
    the AD mission. When activated under less than full mobilization, ADCON remains with the reserve
    associate squadron, while OPCON passes to the AD squadron commander. Under full mobilization,
    reserve associate forces are placed under OPCON and ADCON of the AD Air Force. Reserve associ-
    ate personnel occupy positions according to their proficiency or capability within functional areas.
    3.3. Authority over Administrative Matters. The AFRC chain of command exercises authority
    over reserve associate units in respect to administrative matters such as personnel management (to
    include reserve personnel hiring, ancillary training, and participation scheduling), nonflying train-
    ing-related discipline, supply, services, pay and finance, and other matters not included in the opera-
    tional mission of the AD wing. Refer to AFDD 1 for a complete description.
    3.4. Qualification Requirement. The reserve associate pilots will be qualified according to Air
    Force and AETC standards.
    3.5. Reserve Participation. Reserve personnel participation, including active duty for training
    (ADT) and inactive duty for training (IDT), is accomplished according to AFMAN 36-8001, Reserve
    Personnel Participation and Training Procedures.
AFI36-2253 1 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                               5


   3.6. AGR and TR IP. The AETC and AFRC Associate Instructor Pilot program replaces AD IPs
   with a combination of AGR and TR IPs. Specifically, for every AD IP returned to a major weapons
   system (MWS), AFRC assigns either one AGR or three TR IPs to support the AD AETC wing.
      3.6.1. TR Participation. The AD has primary OPCON responsibility for scheduling AFRC IP
      mission-related duties. In order to achieve the goal of the program, offsetting AD IP workload, the
      TR IP cadre assigned to each AD wing should perform, on average, 72 duty days per year.
      3.6.2. AGR Participation. AFRC AGR IPs have significant responsibilities associated with
      management and administration of the Associate IP Program and will fly at levels commensurate
      with their AD counterparts.

4. Command Relationships:
   4.1. The AFRC Commander commands all reserve organizations and is responsible for the readiness
   of the reserve associate units and for ensuring that the training of these units conforms to the estab-
   lished AETC training standards. AFRC is also responsible for administrative, personnel, logistical,
   and budgetary support as defined in AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures; AFMD 11, Air
   Force Reserve (AFRES); and AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve Component (ARC) Forces.
   4.2. Command, nonflying training-related discipline, and ADCON of reserve associate personnel rest
   with the AFRC command channel.
   4.3. While performing military duties, members of a reserve associate unit are subject to the Uniform
   Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Jurisdiction for military justice and administrative actions rests, pri-
   marily, within the reserve chain of command.

5. Communication Channels:
   5.1. Members of reserve integrated associate units will communicate with their counterpart members
   of the host unit. Route correspondence related specifically to reserve integrated associate policy mat-
   ters through the AFRC chain of command. Units will send copies of correspondence to their AFRC
   and AETC echelons, as appropriate.
   5.2. AETC Aircrew Training and Standardization Division (HQ AETC/DOF) and AFRC Training
   and Tactics Division (HQ AFRC/DOT) are the offices of primary responsibility (OPR) for all reserve
   integrated associate matters.

11. Unit-level Operations:
   11.1. Associate Squadrons:
      11.1.1. Screen and select associate IPs who meet the requirements of the Education and Training
      Course Announcements (ETCA) available at https://etca.randolph.af.mil and paragraph 12. of
      this instruction.
      11.1.2. Generate and administer all Reserve officer performance reports, enlisted performance
      reports, and performance recommendation forms through AFRC channels. AD flying SQ/CCs
      may submit a letter of evaluation to the reserve rating official, if desired.
      11.1.3. Provide the AD SQ/CC with AFRC IP availability and generate orders and administrative
      actions to place reserve personnel in a duty status at those times. The appropriate reserve flight
      commander coordinates with the AD flying SQ/CC for scheduling and training of reserve IPs.
   11.2. AD Operations Group and Squadron Commanders:
      11.2.1. Responsible for all flying and flying-related activities.
      11.2.2. Manage the qualifications and placement of all AFRC IPs within subordinate squadrons
      and flights in coordination with the AFRC squadron.
      11.2.3. Coordinate with the associate group commander before assigning wing or group-level
      duties to any AFRC IP. AD squadron commanders will coordinate with associate squadron com-
      mander before assigning squadron-level duties to any AFRC IP. NOTE: AFRC IPs may serve in
      any AD mission-related wing, operations group, or squadron position or capacity as assigned by
      host AD leadership. For AGR IPs, such assignments can not prevent them from meeting their
      AGR responsibilities.
      11.2.4. Ensure associate IPs meet all training requirements and maintain currency. Commanders
      will schedule additional sorties for associate IPs, when they deem necessary, if associate IPs expe-
      rience extended periods away from instructor duties.

      availability as soon as possible. Ensure that the availability of TR associate IPs support the contin-
      uous execution of the squadron’s flying schedule. Make every effort to smooth-flow TR associate
      IP availability to avoid disruptions in student pilot training.
      11.3.3. Act as the reporting official for all associate IPs within the flight.
      11.3.4. Assist the AD flight commanders in ensuring that associate IPs are current in their aircraft
      and meet their operational requirements.
   11.4. AD Flight Commanders:
      11.4.1. Assign flying and additional duties to integrated associate IPs in a manner similar to any
      flight-assigned AD IP, to include runway supervisory unit (RSU) and supervisor of flying (SOF)
      duty. (NOTE: Coordinate additional duty assignments of TR IPs with the assigned reserve flight
10                                                                     AFI36-2253 1 SEPTEMBER 2005


        commander to ensure adequate availability and coverage. The only restriction on the types of
        additional duties that can be assigned to reserve IPs is that they may not serve as reporting officials
        for AD personnel).
        11.4.2. Forecast sorties for associate IPs based on the availability provided by the associate flight
        commander.
        11.4.3. Manage the CT and mission qualification training (MQT) according to guidance in AFI
        11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1.

12. Associate IP Applicant Qualifications and Gaining Unit Restrictions. The Air Force Personnel
Center routinely screens the assignment history of prospective AD IPs to JSUPT, ENJJPT, and IFF units.
In addition to applicant prerequisites identified in each formal course syllabus, this screening allows the
IP force to maintain a mixture of MDS experience at each unit for mentoring purposes. AFRC IP appli-
cants will meet all ETCA prerequisites () for their MDS. To maintain desired MDS experience levels, the
AFRC IP applicant qualifications and gaining associate unit restrictions apply. This includes:

Section D—Financial Management and Comptroller Functional Responsibilities

16. Objectives. This section explains comptroller responsibilities of the active force and of the reserve
force as they relate to the reserve associate program. The financial management and comptroller position
for this program is based on requirements established by Public Law and the directives of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Air Force for compliance with the law. Objectives in the financial
management and comptroller area to delineate funding responsibilities and identify required financial
management and comptroller support.
     16.1. Delineation of Funding Responsibility. The reserve associate unit is under the command of
     AFRC and is hosted by an AETC base. The parent organization funds those expenses directly related
     to AFRC. Host O&M funds are used to support AFRC tenant units consistent with the funding policy
     contained in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Chapter 15. Therefore, AETC
     finances all expenses that result from support provided by the reserve associate unit.
     16.2. Identification of Required Financial Management and Comptroller Support. F o r g u i d -
     ance on identifying this support, see paragraphs 17., 18., and 19.

17. Training. AETC wing financial management and comptrollers will ensure training is provided as
required by AFI 10-301.

18. Budget. AETC financial management and comptrollers will ensure that funds are executed for
reserve associate unit requirements, as programmed for by HQ AETC/DO. Fund source for expenses aris-
ing from the reserve associate unit concept include:
     18.1. Pay of Personnel:
        18.1.1. RPA provides funds for pay, allowances, uniforms, subsistence, etc., of reserve associate
        members. Pay and allowances are charged to this appropriation for all inactive duty training peri-
        ods and annual tours, special tours of AD for training using RPA man-days, and tours to attend for-
        mal training courses. Detailed guidance is provided in AFMAN 36-8001; DFAS DEM 7073-3,
        Defense Joint Military Pay System-Reserve Component Pay Manual; and DoD 7000.14-R, Vol-
        ume 7A, Military Pay Policy and Procedures-Active Duty and Reserve Pay. Reserve associate
        members cannot qualify for pay for more than two periods of inactive duty training during a single
        calendar day.
        18.1.2. The Air Force military personnel appropriation (MPA) funds the pay and allowances of
        associate members ordered to special tours (tours other than for training, even 1 day) of AD using
        MPA man-days. Headquarters, United States Air Force, controls the use of this appropriation
        through the allocation of AD man-days and the “Reserve Personnel Report of Special Tours of
        Active Duty Chargeable to Military Personnel Appropriation,” both of which are the responsibil-
        ity of AETC Directorate of Manpower and Personnel (HQ AETC/DP). Charges to this appropria-
        tion include flying pay, subsistence, etc., applicable to the period of AD.
AFI36-2253 1 SEPTEMBER 2005                                                                               13


       18.1.3. AGR members are paid through the Defense Joint Military Pay System-Active Compo-
       nent (DJMS-AC). RPA reimburses the AD MPA based on a monthly report generated at
       DFAS-DE. AGR pay and allowances are centrally managed at AFRC Financial Analysis Division,
       Reserve Personnel Branch (HQ AFRC/FMAR).
   18.2. Travel:
       18.2.1. According to Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JTFR), Volume 1, Uniformed Service
       Members, paragraph U7150C.2, associate personnel performing inactive duty training are not
       entitled to funded travel or transportation allowances for such travel, between home and assigned
       duty station.
       18.2.2. JFTR, Volume 1, paragraph U7150A, addresses travel pay entitlement between home and
       assigned duty station for reserve associate personnel on ADT or on annual training duty. When
       authorized, expenses are chargeable to RPA.
       18.2.3. Reserve associate personnel ordered to AD who receive pay from MPA as outlined in
       paragraph 18.1.2. will be funded by AETC for travel pay, when authorized, for travel from home
       to duty station and return.
       18.2.4. Reserve associate personnel who perform reserve training at a location other than the
       home station of their reserve associate unit are entitled to travel pay regardless of whether they are
       on inactive duty training status (when directed), ADT (including annual training duty), or on a
       short tour of AD. RPA is used for temporary duty (TDY) expenses of unit personnel attending for-
       mal training courses and for personnel directed to attend courses under the Air Force Training Pro-
       gram. AFRC funds the TDY expenses for unit personnel to perform staff visits and to attend
       conferences in connection with Air Force Reserve matters. AETC funds TDY for associate per-
       sonnel who perform AETC missions as basic or augmented crewmembers. This includes funding
       for the additional cost to return reserve associate crewmembers to their unit of assignment when
       unexpected delays cause their normal return to extend beyond the tour termination date.
   18.3. Vehicles. AFRC funds AETC-authorized General Services Administration (GSA) lease vehi-
   cles for the reserve associate units.
   18.4. Host Support. AETC will provide support on a nonreimbursable basis that includes:
       18.4.1. Common base support.
       18.4.2. Data automation support required by the reserve associate unit.

19. Financial Services Office:
   19.1. The AETC base-level financial services office will provide support for reserve associate person-
   nel as outlined in the applicable support agreement.
   19.2. Financial Management (340 FTG/FM) will program and request all MPA allocations through
   the Reserve Advisor to the AETC Commander (HQ AETC/CCR). HQ AETC/FMA provides TDY
   funding for reserve associate personnel on MPA man-days. The 340 FTG/ FM will identify and
   request these funds in the base budget submission through channels for HQ AETC/DOR validation.
   ENJJPT will provide TDY funding for reserve associate personnel on MPA man-days in support of
   ENJJPT activities. These funds will be included in the normal ENJJPT budget process. The 340 FTG/
   FM will program and request all RPA school tour allocations through AFRC/FM.
14                                                                  AFI36-2253 1 SEPTEMBER 2005

20. Personnel. The commander of the reserve associate unit is responsible for peacetime management
and control of assigned reservists, both FTS AGRs and TRs, and for selecting, assigning, promoting, and
reassigning all reservists. The reserve military personnel flight (MPF) assigned to the reserve associate
unit will provide all personnel administration, with the exception of on-the-job training (OJT) for
assigned reservists. The host base MPF has no direct responsibility in the peacetime management of
reservists or in the operation of the reserve MPF assigned to the reserve associate unit. However, proper
working relationships will be established (as stated in the unit support agreement) whereby mutual assis-
tance may be exchanged between functional areas of both MPFs.
