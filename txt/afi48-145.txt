                                   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AF OEH Program is to protect health while enhancing combat
and operational capabilities. The program is designed to mitigate OEH-related health risks
through the optimum application of Aerospace Medicine capabilities. It seeks to identify, assess
and eliminate or control health hazards associated with day-to-day operations across the full life-
cycle of acquisition, sustainment and support for weapons systems, munitions and other materiel
systems. The OEH program is a key component of the AF ESOH program as directed in AFPD
90-8.
1.2. Overview.
   1.2.1. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 6055.01, DoD Safety and Occupational
   Health (SOH) Program as implemented by AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs and AFI 91-202, all
   require that every employee be provided with a work environment that is free from
   recognized hazards that cause or are likely to cause death, injury or illness. To ensure this
   objective is achieved, OEH hazards must be effectively anticipated, identified, evaluated, and
   controlled to enhance workforce availability and mission capability. Consistent, meaningful
   OEH assessment programs must be implemented to ensure exposures are adequately
   controlled to protect the health of DoD personnel. Commanders, civilian leaders and
   workplace supervisors, at each management level, are required to advocate for and
   demonstrate a leadership commitment to a strong OEH program and provide all personnel
   safe and healthful working conditions which prevent illness and injuries. An effective OEH
   program uses active hazard prevention and controls, and provides education and training that
   will enable personnel to recognize and prevent OEH-related injuries and illnesses. It is vitally
   important that OEH concerns and deficiencies be communicated early in the acquisition
   process as capability requirements or gaps in accordance with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
   of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3170.01H and during fielding and sustainment using the existing
   problem reporting processes (described in Chapter 3 of AFI 32-7086) to influence new or
   modified systems designs to preclude recurrence of these issues and to eliminate or mitigate
   identified OEH risks in existing systems. Finally, every Airman, which includes all civilian
   employees, has a responsibility to actively participate in their organization’s OEH program.
   1.2.2. This Instruction serves as the foundational document for the overall AF OEH
   Program. The specific program execution requirements are contained in supporting AF
   Manuals. This Instruction outlines standard procedures to effectively capture, analyze,
   document, and communicate information regarding OEH hazards and risks in the workplace.
   A workplace is defined as any environment where a potential OEH exposure may occur. A
   workplace may be administrative, industrial, or inclusive, to include on installation living
   quarters and aircraft. Operational considerations such as mission requirements and resource
   constraints, especially in deployed environments, may necessitate deviation from some
   organizational structures and processes outlined in this AFI. However, the OEH hazard
   identification, risk assessment and documentation process and principles outlined in this AFI
   are identical in both home station and deployed settings. This facilitates the establishment of
   an accurate longitudinal exposure record (LER) in accordance with Presidential Review
   Directive 5, Improving the Health of Our Military, Veterans, and Their Families. In addition,
 6                                                                     AFI48-145 22 JULY 2014


     DoDI 6490.03, Deployment Health requires the creation and maintenance of an exposure
     assessment record for each DoD member’s full career. Requirements outlined in this AFI
     relative to ESOH Council and OEH Working Group do not apply in deployed environments.
     This Instruction also provides guidance regarding the responsibility of AF occupational
     medicine to advise workers and supervisors regarding worker medical fitness to safely
     perform essential job functions.
     1.2.3. The role of Aerospace Medicine relative to human occupational and environmental
     health focuses on health risk assessment (HRA) and associated health monitoring, sampling,
     and surveillance of actual and potential physical, chemical, biological and radiological
     hazards, man-made and naturally occurring, in the workplace and community environment.
     There are parts of the workplace and community environments that can be reasonably
     modified by short-term and long-term interventions to prevent or reduce human health
     impact and there are aspects of the natural environment that cannot. Aerospace Medicine
     personnel must take this under consideration when planning and executing an OEH HRA.
        1.2.3.1. Examples of environmental factors suited to short- and long-term interventions
        are the modifiable aspects or impacts to human health of:
            1.2.3.1.1. Air, water and soil impacted by biological, chemical or radiological agents.
            1.2.3.1.2. Ionizing radiation, electromagnetic fields and noise.
            1.2.3.1.3. Built environments, including industrial and administrative workplaces,
            facilities intended for community use and housing.
            1.2.3.1.4. Behavior related to the availability of safe water and sanitation facilities,
            such as washing hands, and contaminating food with unsafe water or unclean hands.
        1.2.3.2. Examples of environmental factors not well suited to reasonable interventions
        through the procedures established in this AFI are:
            1.2.3.2.1. Social behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco consumption and diet.
            1.2.3.2.2. The natural environments of vectors that cannot be reasonably modified
            (e.g. in rivers, lakes and wetlands).
            1.2.3.2.3. Natural biological phenomena, such as pollen in the outdoor environment.
            1.2.3.2.4. Person-to-person transmission that cannot reasonably be prevented through
            environmental interventions such as improving facilities, sanitary hygiene or the
            occupational environment.
1.3. Concepts:
     1.3.1. This Instruction prescribes the use of an AF-approved OEH Management Information
     System (OEH-MIS) to standardize and enhance data entry, management, and reporting. The
     Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Reporting System – Industrial Hygiene
     (DOEHRS-IH) is the DoD approved OEH-MIS used to manage and archive OEH exposure
     data. The AF uses DOEHRS-IH to manage longitudinal exposure recordkeeping and
     reporting.
     1.3.2. This AFI uses a management system approach (as illustrated in Figure 1.1) to ensure
     continual program improvement through clearly defined OEH roles and responsibilities,
AFI48-145 22 JULY 2014                                                                      7


  planning requirements, effective execution, and management review. It provides a structured
  framework using the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle for:
     1.3.2.1. Organizing and managing OEH functions and responsibilities to develop,
     implement and sustain required OEH capabilities.
     1.3.2.2. Evaluating the effectiveness of the OEH Program and determining how it affects
     the operational mission.

  1.3.3. OEH risks are communicated through the Risk Management (RM) process to engage
  installation leadership in OEH hazard reduction and resource prioritization. The overall OEH
  Program contribution to the supported organization’s RM process is depicted in Figure 1.2.

Figure 1.2. Risk Management.




     1.3.4. Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) personnel play a key role in the RM process by
     identifying actual and potential health threats, assessing and determining significance of
     health risks, determining appropriate control measures, communicating health risk
     information and performing medical surveillance. Health risk assessment inputs augment the
     decision-making process by helping commanders, program managers and other decision
     makers to effectively apply the principles of RM outlined in DoDI 6055.05:
        1.3.4.1. Anticipate/identify hazards,
        1.3.4.2. Assess risks,
        1.3.4.3. Evaluate/make risk control decisions,
        1.3.4.4. Implement risk controls,
        1.3.4.5. Supervise and evaluate.

                                           PLANNING

3.1. Overview. The planning process identifies and prioritizes OEH program issues (hazards,
risks, program deficiencies and opportunities for improvement) to establish objectives, identify
risk reduction opportunities and ensure OEH program improvement.
3.2. Planning.
   3.2.1. HAF.
       3.2.1.1. AF/SG3P establishes/communicates OEH Program priorities to MAJCOM/SG,
       including specific objectives and targets. HAF develops procedures for establishing
       and/or reviewing legal and other requirements, objectives and targets, communications
       and data gathering, assessments, management review and reporting.
       3.2.1.2. SAF/IEE ensures that OEH Program priorities, objectives and targets are
       reviewed and approved annually.
   3.2.2. MAJCOM. MAJCOM/SG communicates OEH Program priorities, objectives and
   targets to installation OEH staff (FOM, BE and PH). MAJCOM/SG may establish specific
   OEH Program objectives/targets as necessary/appropriate.
   3.2.3. Installation. OEH SMEs incorporate HAF and MAJCOM priorities, targets and
   objectives into the installation OEH program. Installations may establish installation-specific
   objectives/targets if necessary/appropriate. The Installation Commander, as the ESOHC
   Chair, reviews and approves installation-specific OEH Program priorities, objectives and
   targets annually. (T-1)
3.3. OEH Program Policy. AF OEH Program policy articulates senior leadership’s vision for
the OEH Program. AF OEH policy and guidance is prepared, documented and published through
the AF information management process as outlined in AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management. OEH policy and guidance consists of both directive and non-directive documents
issued at all levels of organization and incorporated into the 10-, 32-, 40-, 48-, 90- and 91-series
of publications, reflecting the cross-functional elements of the OEH Program. The most critical
elements of the AF OEH Program are contained in 90-series and 48-series publications, as
illustrated in Figure 3.1. These documents are supported by AFIs, AFMANs, AFPAMs and
other policy instruments as needed to establish and maintain all the key compliance, risk
reduction and continual improvement elements of the OEH Program. MAJCOM and installation-
level supplements to these documents may be published as needed to address organization-
specific aspects.

                                        EXECUTION

4.1. Purpose. Feedback from OEH program execution is used in the planning process to
develop future OEH Program objectives and targets in order to improve overall effectiveness.
4.2. Design Review and Change Management. Effective design review and change
management prevents OEH-related injuries\illnesses by identifying hazards and associated risks
before they are introduced into the workplace or community environment.
   4.2.1. BE, with assistance from other Aerospace Medicine functional experts, will
   accomplish OEH design review, including, but not limited to, the following activities: design,
   construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning. (T-1)
4.3. OEH Process Assessment.
   4.3.1. Purpose. OEH process assessment enhances overall mission effectiveness by
   protecting AF personnel from OEH hazards/risks. Process assessment provides a framework
   to:
       4.3.1.1. Integrate AF OEH Program objectives with AFMS desired effects and
       capabilities.
       4.3.1.2. Effectively employ the DoD Industrial Hygiene Exposure Assessment Model to
       prioritize assessment efforts on operations/activities posing the greatest OEH risk.
       4.3.1.3. Evaluate the effectiveness of control options designed to minimize OEH-related
       exposure.
       4.3.1.4. Accurately document OEH exposure(s) to ensure an accurate LER for all AF
       personnel.
       4.3.1.5. Ensure commanders comply with applicable federal, state or host-nation, and
       local regulations, standards and requirements, as applicable.
   4.3.2. Process Description. The AF implementation of the DoD Industrial Hygiene Exposure
   Assessment Model is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The DoD model consists of eight major
   elements, all of which are incorporated into the AF OEH Exposure Assessment Model.
   Implementation is organized into two basic courses of action: Routine and Special
   Assessment.
 28                                                                  AFI48-145 22 JULY 2014

   on the USAFSAM portal.
      4.3.3.1. (See Table 4.1. below.) The required routine assessment frequency establishes a
      minimum requirement. A workplace should be visited and assessed as frequently as
      necessary to adequately identify, assess and control specific OEH hazards. The decision
      to perform a routine assessment more often than the established minimum assessment
      frequency is made by the base BEE, in consultation with the OEHWG.
   4.3.4. Special Assessment. A special assessment is typically a quantitative assessment that
   focuses resources on OEH-related hazards that require additional evaluation or classification.
   Detailed guidance on conducting special assessments can be found in AFMAN 48-146 and
   technical guides written by USAFSAM SMEs and posted on the USAFSAM portal.

4.4. Occupational and Environmental Health Clinical Surveillance. The objective of OEH
clinical surveillance is to protect AF workers by detecting potential failure in controlling
exposure(s). A secondary objective is to protect AF workers by detecting disease at or before the
point it becomes clinically evident.
   4.4.1. Occupational Medicine. Occupational medicine supports AF mission objectives by
   helping optimize workforce availability and the OEH Program with direct clinical functions
   (tertiary preventive medicine), and illness prevention activities (primary and secondary
   prevention). This is accomplished through the performance of all Occupational Medical
   examinations (MSE, FFD, Pre-placement, Injury/Illness and Termination) IAW 29 CFR
   1910, DoDI 6055.05-M and AFMAN 48-146.
   4.4.2. Data Standardization. OEH surveillance programs will be standardized across the Air
   Force as follows (T-1):
       4.4.2.1. FOM will review the OEHED and MSE requirements prior to each MSE. The
       requirements must be those approved by the IOEMC.
       4.4.2.2. If the OEHED and MSE requirements (COHER) located in the employee’s
       electronic medical record are not current, the office completing the examination (FOM or
       PH) will locate and file the current information in the hard copy medical record (or
       upload and attach to the electronic medical record if resources allow).
 30                                                                    AFI48-145 22 JULY 2014


4.5. Education and Training.
   4.5.1. Unit/organizational commanders will ensure general OEH awareness training is
   provided to all personnel (military and civilian). BE routine and special assessment reports,
   as well as workplace-specific Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) training provided IAW
   AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication, will be used to meet this requirement for workplaces
   where OEH risk assessments are required. (T-0)
   4.5.2. Unit/organizational commanders will establish a procedure, with assistance from the
   installation OEH staff, to make personnel aware of:
       4.5.2.1. OEH policy and procedures (i.e. plans, instructions, checklists, etc.). (T-1)
       4.5.2.2. Significant OEH aspects, regulatory compliance issues and actual/potential
       impacts associated with work accomplished under their authority, and mission related
       benefits of improved OEH Program performance. (T-1)
       4.5.2.3. Responsibilities associated with eliminating/reducing OEH risk and maintaining
       regulatory compliance. (T-1)
       4.5.2.4. Potential negative outcomes related to departure from specified plans,
       procedures, checklists, etc. (T-1)
   4.5.3. OEH Program training will be documented on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
   Health Record, in the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) or in other AF-approved
   systems that track/verify training is accomplished. (T-2)
4.6. Emergency Preparedness. Installations will plan for and develop procedures to prevent
and/or respond to foreseeable emergencies, natural and man-made, applicable to their workplace
operations in accordance with Presidential Directives. (T-0)
4.7. Documentation. Personnel must have access to the most current documents and records.
Document control and records management are critical elements of an efficient management
system. Installations shall follow AFMAN 33-363 to establish and maintain an effective OEH
records management program. Those responsible for managing OEH documents and records will
maintain strict compliance with the requirements of 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1904,
Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illness and 29 CFR 1910.1020, Access to
Employee Exposure and Medical Records. Personnel will be briefed and provided access to their
personal exposure records and workplace evaluations by their supervisor and copies of records
will be provided upon request. (T-0)

                          MEASUREMENT AND ASSESSMENT

5.1. Performance Measurement. An effective monitoring/assessment program can identify
significant deviations from “steady-state” OEH program performance. This may provide early
indications the OEH Program is not performing at optimum effectiveness/efficiency.
   5.1.1. Installations shall track operational performance using established/accepted HAF and
   MAJCOM OEH performance measures. Installations may also develop/adopt performance
   measures designed to achieve installation-unique objectives and targets. (T-0)
5.2. Feedback to the Planning Process. The results of monitoring, measurement and
assessment activities, including audits, incident investigations and corrective and preventive
actions, will be addressed in the planning process and the management review.
 32                                                                AFI48-145 22 JULY 2014

                                MANAGEMENT REVIEW

6.1. Purpose. The Program Management Review (PMR) allows for leadership at HAF,
MAJCOM and installation-level, along with OEH Program leaders and process owners, to
critically evaluate OEH Program performance and implement improvements. HAF, MAJCOM
and installation ESOHCs (or equivalent) shall ensure an OEH PMR is conducted at least
annually. (T-0)
6.2. Outcome and Follow-Up. Senior leadership at all levels will provide appropriate direction
for correcting noted deficiencies, including the need for investment, policy revision and
adjustments to objectives and targets. Performance measures will be reviewed during the
ESOHC for appropriateness and relevance, and adjusted as necessary to drive performance
toward established OEH Program objectives and targets. The PMR must be documented IAW
the template provided by AFMOA. (T-1)

cadets; Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadets when engaged in directed training processes;
and foreign national military personnel assigned to the US Air Force.
Air Force Worker—Collective group comprised of Air Force Military and Civilian personnel.
Aspects—OEH aspects are features or characteristics of an activity, product or service that affect
or can affect occupational and environmental health.
Clinical Surveillance—The process by which workers receive Occupational & Environmental
Health Medical Examinations, which are designed and conducted, based on an assessment of
workers’ identified OEH risks. The results of these examinations are analyzed to determine if Air
Force operations are adversely affecting the health of the workers. Clinical surveillance is also
required in specific instances to meet OSHA requirements for medical monitoring. Additionally,
clinical surveillance can be used to assess the adequacy of protective measures.
Confidence in Controls—A qualitative and/or quantitative determination of how well and how
consistently an OEH hazard is being controlled.
Health Risk Assessment (HRA)—A HRA is the process of identifying, evaluating actual or
potential health risks, and developing options for controlling environmental and occupational
health (OEH) threats in specific populations or locations over time.
Limited Scope Medical Treatment Facility (LSMTF)—LSMTFs are medical elements,
flights, or small medical squadrons with a credentialed medical provider that do not provide the
scope of services found in a medical group. LSMTFs are typically assigned to a line squadron or
group (e.g. Air Base Squadron, Mission Support Group or Air Base Group). In some cases, a
LSMTF may report directly to a wing or MAJCOM.
Longitudinal Exposure Record (LER)—A comprehensive record of all occupational and
environmental exposures for a full working lifetime; applies to all DoD personnel.
Medical Aid Station (MAS)—A small medical element without a credentialed medical provider
and typically located at a GSU or MUNSS site.

receipt, storage, maintenance and control of United States War Reserve Munitions in support of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its strike missions. See AFI 21-200.
Objectives—Objectives are derived from program goals and are well-defined, specific and
quantifiable statements of the desired results of the program.
Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment (OEHSA)—The OEHSA is the
key operational health tool for producing data or information used for health risk assessments
(HRA) and to satisfy OEH surveillance requirements. OEHSAs focus on collecting site-specific
data to identify potential or actual exposure pathways during bed down, employ, and sustainment
of air and space forces. (See AFMAN 48-154, Occupational and Environmental Health Site
Assessment, 28 Mar 2007 for additional information)
OEH-Related Illness or Injury—A suspected or confirmed adverse health event caused or
aggravated by employment as described in Occupational Injury and Illness Reporting Guidelines
for Federal Agencies (OMB 1200-0029). OEH-related illness or injury also includes biological
changes indicative of overexposure to a hazard.
 38                                                                   AFI48-145 22 JULY 2014


Population at Risk—The population or a subset of the population that is at risk of experiencing
an event or being exposed to a health threat during a specified period and at a specified location.
Process—Any item of work or situation that may pose a risk and may require evaluation and
control; the lowest level of work that may require evaluation to assess exposure and associated
controls. Not all processes are associated with a physical location, e.g., working near the flight
line may constitute a process. The terms Activity and Process are synonymous.
Routine Assessment—A qualitative and/or quantitative assessment that identifies health hazards
and associated risks to focus limited resources in a prioritized manner.
Special Assessment—Typically a quantitative assessment that focuses resources on OEH-
related hazards that require additional evaluation or classification based on information gained
during routine assessment.
Targets—The specific target values for performance measures designed to measure progress
towards established objectives, e.g. reduce occupational illness by 2% over previous FY.
Unit Health Monitor—An individual appointed by the Unit Commander to ensure that medical
surveillance exams are scheduled and completed by individuals in their organization in a timely
manner, and communicates the status of medical exams completion to the Commander,
supervisors in the organization and to Public Health.
Workplace—Any environment where a potential OEH exposure may occur. A workplace may
be administrative, industrial, or all encompassing, e.g., any setting where an OEH exposure may
occur while deployed.
