     sons currently assigned an area may seasonally apply and be reassigned their previous area for a
     maximum of 3 years. Trappers currently assigned an area will have between 1 and 31 July to reap-
     ply for their previous area. Trappers with grandfather rights who will be on leave or TDY during
     the entire month of July can reapply for their area before July. In this case the trapper will, before
     departing the base, bring proof of leave or TDY to Natural Resources and be registered at that
     time. All areas not applied for or claimed will be assigned to new applicants by a drawing after l
     August. Natural Resources will announce the time and date. New applicants must be present at the
     drawing and personally register a trapping area. The only exceptions will be if an applicant is
     TDY or on emergency leave. In this case, prior arrangements will be made with Natural Resources
     before 31 July and a stand-in may reserve an area. Proof of TDY or emergency leave will be
     required. The TDY or emergency leave applicant will register the area within 5 working days after
     returning to base. Only one area can be registered per individual family. Areas not registered dur-
     ing the drawing will be assigned to new applicants on a first come basis until they are gone. Once
     all areas have been registered, Natural Resources will compile a trapping area waiting list. Areas
     turned in for reassignment will be registered using the waiting list. When the trapping season is
     half over, Natural Resources will stop registering turned-in areas.
     8.3.3. Only persons registered for an area can trap that area. An exception will be if a person(s) is
     trapping an area, the trapper(s) can sublet the area to another person for certain furbearers or hare.
     This individual will obtain written permission from the trapper and present it to Natural Resources
     for endorsement. Snares will be the only means of taking hare by persons not registered for a base
     trapping area. Any furbearers accidentally snared by these persons will be turned over to the trap-
     per registered for the area. Persons who do not trap their assigned area will not sublet it to another
8                                                                        354FWI32-7001 21 JUNE 2004


       person. Persons not trapping their assigned area by 20 November will contact Natural Resources
       by 23 November and turn in their area for reassignment. Natural Resources will have the authority
