This AFNWC Instruction codifies the internal POM process for all AFNWC organizations, by
developing guidance, roles and responsibilities, and process flow in an effort to effectively
collect, define, validate, defend and rank AFNWC requirements for mission execution. This
publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. This publication does
not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG). Refer recommended changes and questions about
this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force (AF) Form

See Attachment 1 for a Glossary of References and Supporting Documentation.

1. Background/Overview. All AFNWC organizations must develop proposed requirements
consistent with the policy, strategy force, resource, and fiscal guidance provided in the strategic
plan and Center commander’s priorities. These requirements, expressed in the POM, reflect
systematic analysis of missions and objectives to be achieved, alternative methods of
accomplishing them, and the allocation of resources. In addition to the budget year, the program
period is the five years beyond the budget year for cost and manpower.

2. Policies.
     2.1. The intent of this instruction is to provide guidance for programming AFNWC
     requirements to support upcoming POM requirements. The overarching intent of the POM
     process is to thoroughly vet and prioritize all requirements through the AFNWC
     leadership/Directorates and subsequently obtain the Commander’s (CC) approval for
     requirements identified to support the AFNWC mission essential materials and services, as
     recommended by the AFNWC Plans and Programs Directorate (XP)--in direct support of
     AFMC operational and sustainment nuclear priorities.
     2.2. The AFNWC POM process is a subset of the process used by Headquarters Air Force
     Materiel Command (HQ AFMC). All recommendations made through the AFNWC POM
     process will go through the HQ AFMC POM Panel structure.

Terms
Disconnect/Offset/Initiative (D/O/I)— Disconnect (D) – An approved program, or portions of
a program, requiring additional funding because of a mismatch between its resources and content
approved by SECAF and CSAF (a) dollars don’t equal directed program content (b) options:
fund, restructure, kill…or accept risk. Offset (O) – Resources identified to pay for disconnects,
initiatives, or corporate bills. Sources: (a) eliminating programs (b) reducing program content
(c) delaying or stretching out a program. Initiative (I) – Initiatives must be mission critical.
Initiatives identifying return on investment (ROI) or savings must clearly document when the
savings will be generated and should expect those to be used to meet HQ AFMC mission needs
(a) proposal or requirement for new program content requiring additional funds (b) proposal for
an alternative to a current program (c) proposal for a new start.
Financial Management Allocation (FMA)— FMA Funding represents the program baseline
adjusted for known changes. It will be essential the Center users ensure the Baseline Allocated
is equal to the FMA Funding at the PEC and Appropriation level for their Center. If they are not,
adjustments to the Baseline Allocated values at the record level must be made until the totals for
the Baseline Allocated and the FMA Funding at the PEC and appropriation level are balanced.
This should be done before any reallocation work is done, and before disconnects, initiatives,
and offsets are determined.
Program Management Administration (PMA)— Currently, AFI 65-601, Budget Guidance
and Procedures, reads that PMA for centers will be from PE’s 78070F and 72806F. In the
current POM, we will continue to POM for the requirements where they are currently being
supported. In addition, the PIP panel requests all centers to mark their PMA requirements in
CMS by putting the letters PMA in one of the following: (a) local tag 1 (b) local tag 2 or (c)
office. This allows the panel to make a comprehensive PMA disconnect for all centers. PMA
normally has a definition that applies primarily to support of investment programs. For the sake
of having an acronym to use in the Local Tag, we will use the PMA nomenclature to signify
support at the center or wing level that runs O&M organizations. PMA includes requirements
such as TDY, supplies and equipment, A&AS type contractor support, and training. This is not
an all inclusive list but it comprises the majority of the types of requirements usually associated
with PMA.
POM— The POM submission is a 5-year outlook on budget requirements. It starts with the year
following the President's Budget, which is always one year ahead of the current year. The format
may vary somewhat from year to year based on the POM guidance.
POM Book— A product provided to the AFNWC/CC capturing the final results of the AFNWC
Council review of the Center’s POM requirements.

         AFNWC PROGRAM OBJECTIVE MEMORANDUM (POM) SCORING
                          METHODOLOGY

A2.1. The criteria defined within this document will be utilized to develop the AFNWC’s initial
prioritization of POM requirements. All requirements will be grouped into 3 possible groups
(Mission Critical, Mission Essential, and Mission Enhancement), and then prioritized within
each individual group using the criteria defined in this document. Requirements will be scored in
each of the 3 identified POM scoring areas (Directed Authority, Time Sensitivity, and Cost
Impact) and the sum of the 3 scores equals the overall requirement score, which will determine
the requirement’s initial priority within the assigned group. Requirements receiving a score of 9
will be rigorously investigated and scrutinized.
Note: Previous year funded requirements will be elevated to the top of the prioritization list to
ensure approved requirements remain aligned with previous POM decisions and associated
funding stream.
A2.2. POM Requirements Groups:
A2.2.1. Mission Critical: Significant impact to Combat Air Force’s (CAF) Status of Resources
and Training System (SORTS) readiness ratings or CAF Strategic Plan required
capabilities/actions associated with the Nuclear Enterprise. If funded, the requirement will
significantly increase future CAF Strategic Modernization Program (SMP) required readiness or
capability. If modernization requirement is not funded, critical capabilities or systems required
by the CAF Strategic Plan will be lost, severely impaired, or not achieved. If a readiness
requirement is not funded, it will result in a CAF-wide C4 SORTS rating for the affected system.
A2.2.2. Mission Essential: Moderate impact to CAF SORTS readiness ratings or CAF Strategic
Plan required capabilities/actions associated with the Nuclear Enterprise. If funded, the
requirement will moderately increase future CAF Strategic required readiness or capability. If a
modernization requirement is not funded, the impact results in moderate degradation of critical
capabilities or systems required by the CAF Strategic Plan. For readiness requirements, the
results is a CAF-wide C3 SORTS rating.
A2.2.3. Mission Enhancement: Minor impact to CAF SORT readiness rating or CAF Strategic
Plan required capabilities/actions associated with the Nuclear Enterprise. The requirement will
somewhat increase readiness or capability, or, if not funded, the impact results in some
degradation of CAF Strategic Plan required critical capabilities, systems, or readiness ratings
A2.3. POM Scoring Areas/Strata: Strata scoring be based on 4 possible scores (9, 3, 1 and 0).

AFNWCI90-101 3 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                       13


(1) Examples: Joint Program, Combatant Command (COCOM) requirement identified in an
Integrated Priority List (IPL), or indirect guidance from any of the above.
(0) None

A.2.3.2. Time Sensitivity:

(9) Urgent. Requirements must be funded in FYXX-XX to avoid unacceptable safety impacts,
cause program termination, incur unacceptable program cost increases or fielding delays, or
cause serious breakdowns in logistics support, CAF SORTS readiness ratings and meeting
National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) or Nuclear Council (NC) timeframes.

(3) Immediate. Requirements impact milestones, production, fielding, or contracts that cause
significant delays or cost increases short of program termination, or a significant breakdown in
logistics support and readiness ratings.

(1) Priority. Requirements cause minor delays in milestones, production, fielding, or contracts
that result in some program delays or cost increases or require logistics support or readiness
rating workarounds.
(0) None.

A.2.3.3. Cost Impact:

(9) High payback (>5:1 within Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) or large life cycle
savings/cost avoidance (>$100M). Operations and Maintenance (O&M) issues requiring
execution year funding >$10M.

(3) Medium payback (>2:1 within FYDP) or medium life cycle savings/cost avoidance (>$50M).
O&M issues requiring execution year funding <$10M.

(1) Low payback (<2:1 within FYDP) or low life cycle savings/cost avoidance (<$5M.). O&M
issues requiring execution year funding <$5M. Maintenance manpower savings could be
considered.
(0) Unknown or no payback or life cycle cost savings. O&M issues requiring no execution year
funding.
