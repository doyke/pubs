                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Mission. Intelligence personnel participate in the planning and execution of Air Force
operations. Through close, continuing interface, intelligence personnel ensure commanders, their
staffs, combat crews, weapon system developers and other customers are provided the best
available information and materials to enhance readiness, facilitate planning, execute assigned
missions and build warfighting capability. Intelligence supports strategic, operational, and
tactical operations by providing information and services to a divergent set of customers, ranging
from national to unit-level decision makers.
1.2. Office of Primary Responsibility. AF/A2 delegates office of primary responsibility (OPR)
for this instruction to AF/A2F.
1.3. Senior Intelligence Officer Authority. The Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO) is
responsible for and is the final authority for intelligence functions and operations within an
organization.
     1.3.1. SIO Definition. The SIO is defined as the highest-ranking Air Force officer holding
     the 14N3 or 14N4 Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) or Series 0132 Civilian serving in an
     Air Force intelligence position. The SIO's authority extends to all directly subordinate units.
     Installations with intelligence activities in different chains of command will have separate
     SIOs. In this capacity, the SIO provides senior guidance on all policy development,
     interpretations, and applications. Further, the SIO serves as the chief advisor and mentor for
     AF intelligence officers, enlisted and civilians (as appropriate) in terms of career
     development and progress.
     1.3.2. This AFI provides broad guidance and cannot address every conceivable
     circumstance. SIOs will use their best judgment to ensure the safe conduct and effective
     application of intelligence operations.
1.4. Compliance. The SIO will ensure compliance with the following:
     1.4.1. This AFI, MAJCOM supplements and provides additional guidance applicable to
     intelligence operations.
     1.4.2. MDS/functional/activity-specific instructions and supplements.
     1.4.3. Procedures and special notices in the Intelligence Read File (IRF), Air Force
     directives, and MAJCOM directives.
1.5. Supplements. MAJCOM (or other) supplements and AFI 14-2 Mission Design Series
(MDS), Weapon System, Intelligence Function, Activity-Specific, Volume 3, (hereafter referred
to as AFI 14-2(MDS)v3) instructions shall not be less restrictive than this instruction.
1.6. Waiver Authority. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, AF/A2 is the waiver
authority for this instruction. Request waivers to the basic guidance in this instruction through
applicable channels to the MAJCOM/A2 or equivalent level. MAJCOM/A2 will forward request
in message or memo format to AF/A2, with a courtesy copy to AF/A2F. Waivers to
AFI14-202V3 10 MARCH 2008                                                                        5


supplemental guidance will be handled by the MAJCOM agency that generated the supplement.
The National Guard Bureau (NGB) is considered a MAJCOM for this purpose.
1.7. Support to Joint/Combined Operations. Air Force intelligence support to joint
operations is based on requirements and capabilities, with the objective of ensuring timely,
pertinent, and adequate intelligence support to US commanders and forces. Air Force
intelligence is used to assist commanders in identifying and determining objectives and strategy,
assisting staffs and forces in planning operations, supporting the conduct of operations, and
evaluating the effects of operations. All Air Force intelligence organizations involved in support
of joint operations have the responsibility to:
   1.7.1. Provide intelligence to assist the Joint Forces Commander (JFC)/Combined Forces
   Commander (CFC) in the identification, nomination, and achievement of military objectives.
   1.7.2. Operate on the basis of sharing intelligence resources, expertise, and intelligence
   products.
   1.7.3. Identify at each echelon intelligence requirements that cannot be met by their organic
   capability.
   1.7.4. Initiate the request for information (RFI) process if unable to satisfy tasked
   requirements with available resources.
1.8. Internal Management. Intelligence personnel will not be assigned additional duties that
interfere with their contingency taskings and primary intelligence responsibilities. Intelligence
personnel will not be designated as augmentees for other base functions during operational
missions.
1.9. Intelligence Oversight Program. All active duty, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC),
Air National Guard (ANG) and civilian personnel assigned to intelligence units or staffs,
regardless of specialty, will be familiar with and adhere to the provisions of DoD 5240.1-R,
Procedures Governing the Activities of DoD Intelligence Components that Affect United States
Persons, AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and AFI 14-104, Conduct of Intelligence
Activities. Contractor personnel, if engaged in intelligence activities, will also be familiar with
and adhere to the publications cited.
1.10. Control, Protection and Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Proper control,
protection of sources and methods, and dissemination of intelligence is crucial to an effective
fighting force. Breaches in intelligence information security, and the compromise of our
intelligence collection methods and sources, whether intentional or inadvertent, can cripple
military effectiveness, risk lives, and deny access to critically important information. The Air
Force will disseminate intelligence information to the lowest level requiring access while
properly controlling the release of the information and reporting unauthorized disclosures. All
active duty, AFRC, ANG and civilian personnel assigned to intelligence units or staffs,
regardless of specialty, will be familiar with and adhere to the provisions of AFPD 14-3, Control,
Protection and Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Contractor personnel, if engaged in
intelligence activities, will also be familiar with and adhere to this publication.
1.11. Change Recommendations. Submit suggested changes to this instruction on AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication through MAJCOM channels.

required by their respective AFI 14-2(MDS)v1. See Mission Ready (MR).
Communications Security (COMSEC)—The protection resulting from all measures designed
to deny unauthorized persons information of value that might be derived from the possession and
study of telecommunications, or to mislead unauthorized persons in their interpretation of the
results of such possession and study. Communications security includes: cryptosecurity,
transmission security, emission security, and physical security of communications security
materials and information. a. cryptosecurity--The component of communications security that
results from the provision of technically sound cryptosystems and their proper use. b.
transmission security--The component of communications security that results from all measures
designed to protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than
cryptanalysis. c. emission security--The component of communications security that results from
all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information of value that might be derived from

telecommunications systems. d. physical security--The component of communications security
that results from all physical measures necessary to safeguard classified equipment, material, and
documents from access thereto or observation thereof by unauthorized persons.
Computer Security (COMPUSEC)—The protection resulting from all measures to deny
unauthorized access and exploitation of friendly computer systems.
Concept of Operations (CONOPS)—A verbal or graphic statement, in broad outline, of a
commander's assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations. The concept
of operations frequently is embodied in campaign plans and operation plans; in the latter case,
particularly when the plans cover a series of connected operations to be carried out
simultaneously or in succession. The concept is designed to give an overall picture of the
operation. It is included primarily for additional clarity of purpose. Also called commander's
concept.
CONPLAN—An operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable
expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the
combatant commander's strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary
by the combatant commander to complete planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are
not calculated and time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) files are not prepared. A
CONPLAN with TPFDD is the same as a CONPLAN except that it requires more detailed
planning for phased deployment of forces.
Continuation Training (CT)—CT provides the volume, frequency and mix of training
necessary for intelligence personnel to maintain proficiency in their assigned qualification level.
The Ready Intelligence Program (RIP) outlines the minimum CT requirements. RIP is designed
to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions. Continuation
AFI14-202V3 10 MARCH 2008                                                                           31


Training (CT) is separate from skill level upgrade training, although CT may fulfill some skill
level upgrade training requirements. CT and RIP are discussed further in Chapter 4 of the MDS-
specific AFI 14-2(MDS)v1.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure intelligence personnel maintain a minimum level of proficiency in a
given event.
Debriefing—The process to convert mission information into intelligence for dissemination to
affected parties. The intelligence specialist will extract relevant mission intelligence from
pilots/aircrew, ask amplifying questions relevant to the mission, identify time-sensitive
information and disseminate appropriately and expediently.
Deployment Briefing—A briefing to provide intelligence information to pilots/aircrew, key
staff, and deploying personnel prior to deployment. Intelligence information is tailored to the
unit’s specific mission, roles and combat profiles in accordance with the unit OPLAN/OPORD
tasking.
Electronic Intelligence (ELINT)—Technical and geolocation intelligence derived from foreign
non-communications electromagnetic radiations emanating from other than nuclear detonations
or radioactive sources.
Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFIs)—Key questions to be asked by adversary
officials and intelligence systems about specific friendly intentions, capabilities, and activities, so
they can obtain answers critical to their operational effectiveness.
Essential Elements of Information (EEIs)—Critical items of information about the enemy and
the battlespace required by the commander and planners to successfully prosecute an operation.
Have aircrews review established EEIs and prepare them to observe and report any significant
information during debrief.
Formal Course—Training courses listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course
Announcement (ETCA).
Geospatial Information and Services (GI&S)—The concept for collection, information
extraction, storage, dissemination, and exploitation of geodetic, geomagnetic, imagery (both
commercial and national source), gravimetric, aeronautical, topographic, hydrographic, littoral,
cultural, and toponymic data accurately referenced to a precise location on the earth's surface.
These data are used for military planning, training, and operations including navigation, mission
planning, mission rehearsal, modeling, simulation and precise targeting. Geospatial information
provides the basic framework for battlespace visualization. It is information produced by
multiple sources to common interoperable data standards. It may be presented in the form of
printed maps, charts, and publications; in digital simulation and modeling databases; in
photographic form; or in the form of digitized maps and charts or attributed centerline data.
Geospatial services include tools that enable users to access and manipulate data, and also
includes instruction, training, laboratory support, and guidance for the use of geospatial data.
Human Resources Intelligence (HUMINT)—A category of intelligence derived from
information collected and provided by human sources.
Imagery Intelligence (IMINT)—Intelligence derived from the exploitation of collection by
visual photography, infrared sensors, lasers, electro-optics, and radar sensors such as synthetic
 32                                                             AFI14-202V3 10 MARCH 2008


aperture radar wherein images of objects are reproduced optically or electronically on film,
electronic display devices, or other media.
Initial Situation Briefing—A briefing to provide the commander and key staff with intelligence
pertaining to the current crisis, and the events that have led to it. The briefing will usually be
presented following recall or alert notification.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—Training needed to qualify intelligence personnel for
basic duties in an assigned position for a specific MDS, weapons system, intelligence function or
activity, without regard for a unit's specific mission.
Intelligence—Information relating to the capabilities, intentions and activities of foreign powers,
organizations or persons, but not including CI (except for information on international terrorist
activities). Intelligence collects and analyzes information in order to forewarn decision makers,
commanders and operators (aircrews, security forces, etc.) before an act occurs.
Intelligence Formal Training Unit (FTU)—Formal intelligence training to support a specific
mission design series weapons system or specific intelligence function. Intelligence personnel
will complete Intelligence FTUs, where available, as part of Initial Qualification Training.
Intelligence Read File (IRF)—A collection of publications and material determined by the
MAJCOM and unit as necessary for day-to-day intelligence operations.
Intelligence Requirement—A requirement for intelligence to fill a gap in the command’s
knowledge and understanding of the battlespace or threat forces. Intelligence requirements are
designed to reduce the uncertainties associated with successful completion of a specific friendly
cours of action (COA); a change in the COA usually leads to a change in intelligence
requirements. Intelligence requirements that support decisions which affect the overall mission
accomplishment are designated by the commander as priority intelligence requirements (PIR).
Less important intelligence requirements are designated as IR.
Master Question File (MQF)—Question bank used to construct closed book exams.
Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT)—Scientific and technical intelligence
obtained by quantitative and qualitative analysis of data (metric, angle, spatial, wavelength, time
dependence, modulation, plasma, and hydromagnetic) derived from specific technical sensors for
the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the target. The detected feature
may either be reflected or emitted.
Mission Briefing—A briefing to provide the pilots/aircrew with the latest intelligence affecting
the mission. Accurate and timely intelligence information should be provided on targets, mission
areas, en-route threats, evasion and recovery, and any other factors essential to mission success.
Mission Planning Cell (MPC) Initial/Feasibility Briefing—A briefing to provide the MPC
with a review of the tactical mission(s) to include overall battle situation, threats, & target
considerations.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training needed to qualify intelligence personnel to
perform their specific unit mission in an assigned position. AFI 14-2(MDS)v1 prescribes
minimum MQT requirements.
AFI14-202V3 10 MARCH 2008                                                                            33


Mission Ready (MR)—The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily completed
MQT and maintain qualification and currency in the appropriate tasks and knowledge required
by their respective AFI 14-2(MDS)v1. See Combat Mission Ready (CMR)..
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)—Any headquarters, agency, or activity having the
primary functional interest in, and responsibility for, a specific action, project, plan, program, or
problem.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Command authority that may be exercised by commanders at
any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within the command. When
forces are transferred between combatant commands, the command relationship the gaining
commander will exercise (and the losing commander will relinquish) over these forces must be
specified by the Secretary of Defense. Operational control is the authority to perform those
functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands
and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary
to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of
military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the
command. Operational control should be exercised through the commanders of subordinate
organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through subordinate joint force commanders
and Service and/or functional component commanders. Operational control normally provides
full authority to organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in
operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of
itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal
organization, or unit training.
Operations Order (OPORD)—A directive issued by a commander to subordinate commanders
for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation.
Operations Plan (OPLAN)—Any plan, except for the Single Integrated Operational Plan, for
the conduct of military operations. Plans are prepared by combatant commanders in response to
requirements established by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of
subordinate commands in response to requirements tasked by the establishing unified
commander. Operation plans are prepared in either a complete format (OPLAN) or as a concept
plan (CONPLAN). The CONPLAN can be published with or without a time-phased force and
deployment data (TPFDD) file. An operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be
used as a basis for development of an operation order (OPORD). An OPLAN identifies the
forces and supplies required to execute the combatant commander's strategic concept and a
movement schedule of these resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are
identified in TPFDD files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan is
prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as described in the Joint
Operation Planning and Execution System manuals containing planning policies, procedures, and
formats.
Operations Security (OPSEC)—A process of identifying critical information and subsequently
analyzing friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to: a. identify those
actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems; b. determine indicators that
hostile intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive
critical information in time to be useful to adversaries; and c. select and execute measures that

eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary
exploitation.
Order of Battle (OB)—The identification, strength, command structure and disposition of
personnel, units and equipment of any military force.
Production Requirement (PR)—An established intelligence need considered in the allocation
of intelligence resources to fulfill the essential elements of information and other intelligence
needs of a commander.
Proficiency—The quality of having competence and a command of the fundamentals derived
from practice and familiarity. A measure of how well a task is completed. An individual is
considered proficient when he/she can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed,
accuracy, and safety.
Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO)—The SIO is the highest-ranking Air Force officer holding
the 14N3 or 14N4 Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) and serving in an Air Force intelligence
position. The SIO's authority extends to all directly subordinate units. Installations with
intelligence activities in different chains of command will have separate SIOs. In this capacity,
the SIO provides senior guidance on all policy development, interpretations, and applications.
Further, the SIO serves as the chief advisor and mentor for AF intelligence officers, enlisted and
civilians (as appropriate) in terms of career development and progress.
Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)—1. A category of intelligence comprising either individually or
in combination all communications intelligence, electronic intelligence, and foreign
instrumentation signals intelligence, however transmitted. 2. Intelligence derived from
communications, electronic, and foreign instrumentation signals.
Situation Briefing—A briefing to provide the commander and key staff and pilots/aircrew with
the latest intelligence to assist in decision-making.
Situation Map—A map showing the tactical or the administrative situation at a particular time.
Specialized Training—Training in any skill necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions
that is not required by every intelligence unit member. Specialized Training is accomplished
after Mission Qualification Training and after the member is assigned MR/CMR or BMC status,
and is in addition to MR/CMR or BMC requirements. For example, as outlined in AFI 14-2F-16,
F-16 Unit Intelligence Training, an External Intelligence Trainer (EIT) requires Specialized
Training and certification to conduct intelligence training for pilots. EITs have additional
qualification and currency requirements to maintain proficiency in conducting intelligence
training.
Special Tactics Squadron (STS)—A task-organized squadron of special tactics that may
include combat control, pararescue, and combat weather personnel. Functions include austere
airfield and assault zone reconnaissance, surveillance, establishment, and terminal control;
terminal attack control; combat search and rescue; combat casualty care and evacuation staging;
and tactical weather observations and forecasting.
Staff Assistance Visit (SAV)—A visit from higher headquarters intelligence personnel usually
to review subordinate unit processes and procedures to evaluate and improve programs and
overall combat readiness.
AFI14-202V3 10 MARCH 2008                                                                        35


Step Briefing—A briefing given to pilots/aircrew immediately prior to departure for tasked
mission. The step briefing provides the pilots/aircrew with last minute intelligence affecting their
mission.
Training Command—The MAJCOM assigned responsibility for formal school training in each
MDS/weapons system-specific intelligence function or activity.
Target Materials—Graphic, textual, tabular, or other presentations of target intelligence
primarily designed to support operations against designated targets by one or more weapons
systems. Target materials are suitable for training, planning, executing, or evaluating such
operations.
Threat Update Codes (TUC)—Codes used to communicate significant new threat information
to aircrew and mission planners as rapidly as possible. TUCs are tracked by alphabetical or
numerical codes, which will enable units and aircrew to track these significant changes to ensure
they have the most current information before stepping to a mission. This also will assist in
providing airborne updates through airborne controllers. TUCs are reserved for new and critical
information that may have a direct impact on the mission. Specific TUC criteria will be JFACC-
developed. For example, at the first mission briefing of the day the threat code is zero or A
(according to JFACC-developed criteria). In this example, a SAM site is relocated and the unit
receives new coordinates. Because this will impact the unit's missions, a threat update is issued
and the letter/number is changed- to 1 or B, for example. If a pilot/aircrew asks what the TUC is
and it is different than the last one the pilot/aircrew had, the pilot/aircrew knows the threat
intelligence needs to be updated with whatever changed since the last update.
Trend Program—Analysis designed to identify areas requiring attention, monitoring or
correction.
Unit—A level of organization under HHQs (MAJCOM) required to establish an intelligence
function.
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A Joint Chiefs of Staff developed and assigned code, consisting of
five characters that uniquely identify a "typeunit."
