SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change adds risk factors, known as “tiers” to tasks assigned to organizations below
major command (MAJCOM) level to depict the assessed risk of non-compliance. Self-
assessment direction has been modified to address MICT guidance in light of the new AF
Inspection System. References to Statement of Intelligence Interest (SII) and Intelligence
Reference Materials Manager (IRMM) have been removed as the requirement is no longer valid.
Guidance on Intelligence Read File (IRF) and Go/No-go procedures have been relocated from
AFI 14-202, Volume 2. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Mission. Intelligence personnel participate in the planning and execution of Air Force
operations. Through close, continuing interface, intelligence personnel ensure commanders, their
staffs, combat crews, weapon system developers and other customers are provided the best
available information and materials to enhance readiness, facilitate planning, execute assigned
missions and build warfighting capability. Intelligence supports strategic, operational, and
tactical operations by providing information and services to a divergent set of customers, ranging
from national to unit-level decision makers.
1.2. Applicability.
     1.2.1. The AFI 14-202 publications apply to those personnel who perform intelligence duties
     supporting AF operational missions at the wing-level and below (as defined in AFI 38-101,
     Air Force Organization). These intelligence activities require clear guidance and oversight
     to ensure the proper allocation of AF resources to ensure the AF is ready to support
     Combatant Commander Objectives. MAJCOMs will determine the applicability of these
     publications for mission sets not otherwise specifically addressed by published guidance.
     1.2.2. This publication is not intended to apply to functions such as command staff, technical
     training activities, or acquisition support unless specifically directed by AFI 14-2[MDS]
     series publications. Nor is it intended to apply to mission sets already governed by other
     guidance (such as non-14-series AFIs) provided there is clear and sufficient guidance to
     effectively direct intelligence activities. Commanders of these units may choose to adopt the
     processes contained in AFI 14-202 for their personnel, but it is not required by this AFI
     series or AFPD 14-2. MAJCOMs will determine the applicability of these publications for
     mission sets not otherwise specifically addressed by published guidance.
1.3. Senior Intelligence Officer Authority. The Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO) is
responsible for and is the final authority for intelligence functions and operations within an
organization.
     1.3.1. SIO Definition. This is the highest-ranking Air Force Airman that has: 1) been
     awarded an Air Force intelligence Specialty Code (or civilian occupational series) and 2) is
     serving in an Air Force intelligence position. The SIO's authority extends to all
     subordinate/lateral units. In this capacity, the SIO provides senior guidance on all policy
     affecting intelligence operations. Further, the SIO serves as the chief advisor and mentor for
     AF intelligence officers, enlisted and civilians (as appropriate) in terms of career
     development and progression. Installations with intelligence activities in different chains of
     command will have separate SIOs each responsible for applicable tasks to their commander
     and inspectable by their respective MAJCOM IG.
     1.3.2. This AFI provides broad guidance and cannot address every conceivable
     circumstance. SIOs will use their best judgment to ensure the safe conduct and effective
     application of intelligence operations.
1.4. Compliance. The SIO will ensure compliance with the following: (T-1)
AFI14-202V3 10 MARCH 2008                                                                       5


   1.4.1. This AFI, MAJCOM supplements and provides additional guidance applicable to
   intelligence operations.
   1.4.2. MDS/functional/activity-specific instructions and supplements.
   1.4.3. Procedures and special notices in the Intelligence Read File (IRF), Air Force
   directives, and MAJCOM directives.
1.5. DELETE
1.6. DELETE
1.7. Support to Joint/Combined Operations. Air Force intelligence support to joint
operations is based on requirements and capabilities, with the objective of ensuring timely,
pertinent, and adequate intelligence support to US commanders and forces. Air Force
intelligence is used to assist commanders in identifying and determining objectives and strategy,
assisting staffs and forces in planning operations, supporting the conduct of operations, and
evaluating the effects of operations. All Air Force intelligence organizations involved in support
of joint operations have the responsibility to:
   1.7.1. Provide intelligence to assist the Joint Forces Commander (JFC)/Combined Forces
   Commander (CFC) in the identification, nomination, and achievement of military objectives.
   1.7.2. Operate on the basis of sharing intelligence resources, expertise, and intelligence
   products.
   1.7.3. Identify at each echelon intelligence requirements that cannot be met by their organic
   capability.
   1.7.4. Initiate the request for information (RFI) process if unable to satisfy tasked
   requirements with available resources.
1.8. Internal Management. Intelligence personnel will not be assigned additional duties that
interfere with their contingency taskings and primary intelligence responsibilities. Intelligence
personnel will not be designated as augmentees for other base functions during operational
missions. (T-2)
1.9. Intelligence Oversight Program. All RegAF, AFR, ANG, and civilian personnel assigned
to intelligence units or staffs, regardless of specialty, will be familiar with and adhere to the
provisions of DoD 5240.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of DoD Intelligence
Components that Affect United States Persons, AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and
AFI 14-104, Conduct of Intelligence Activities. Contractor personnel, if engaged in intelligence
activities, will also be familiar with and adhere to the publications cited. (T-0)
1.10. Control, Protection and Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Proper control,
protection of sources and methods, and dissemination of intelligence is crucial to an effective
fighting force. Breaches in intelligence information security, and the compromise of our
intelligence collection methods and sources, whether intentional or inadvertent, can cripple
military effectiveness, risk lives, and deny access to critically important information. The Air
Force will disseminate intelligence information to the lowest level requiring access while
properly controlling the release of the information and reporting unauthorized disclosures. All
personnel assigned to intelligence units or staffs, regardless of specialty, will be familiar with
and adhere to the provisions of AFPD 14-3, Control, Protection and Dissemination of
 6                                                              AFI14-202V3 10 MARCH 2008

Terms
Tier 0 (T-0)—Determined by respective non-AF authority (e.g., Congress, White House, OSD,
JS). The requirement is external to AF. Requests for waivers must be processed through
command channels to publication OPR for consideration.
Tier 1 (T-1)—Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders or the AF strongly at risk of mission
or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. T-1
waiver requests may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than
MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence of the publication's approving official.
Tier 2 (T-2)—Non-compliance has the potential to create moderate risk of mission or program
degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. Waivers
may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than MAJCOM
Director.
Tier 3 (T-3)—Non-compliance has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or
program degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
Waivers may be granted at the Wing/DRU/FOA/CC level.
