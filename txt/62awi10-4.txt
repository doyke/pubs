    11.3. Foreign National access to Automated Information System (AIS) is outlined in AFI 33-202 Vol
    1, Network and Computer Security, para 3.7. This AFI covers the procedures for obtaining approval to
    grant a foreign national access to an AIS. Exchange officers fall under the Defense Personnel
    Exchange Program but are not exempt from this process.
       11.3.1. Microsoft Exchange officer access to e-mail and/or NIPRNET must be processed through
       62d Communications Squadron Information Assurance Office (62 CS/SCBS). Access approval

    cise, a training mission or an ongoing operation, the supervisor must inform 62 AW/XPO for disclo-
    sure guidance (if required) and to notify the parent government. Due to the nature of HQ AMC
    missions, notifying the parent government may occur after the pilot has already departed on the mis-
    sion.
       11.4.1. The Canadian government through Air Force and HQ AMC/A8XI have given blanket
       approval for the Canadian exchange pilots to fly missions in support of Operation ENDURING
       FREEDOM and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (HQ AMC/IN letter, dated 2 Apr 02 – copy main-
       tained by 62 AW/XPO).
       11.4.2. The assigned unit will notify 62 AW/XPO at the earliest opportunity of the mission and
       the FDO in turn will notify HQ AMC/A8XI.
       11.4.3. HQ AMC/INX (now HQ AMC/A8XI) in their letter dated 2 Apr 02, signed by HQ AMC/
       IN, unauthorized the Canadian officers access to classified military information. A letter signed by
       the unit commander should be attached to the pilot’s special orders when deploying. Additional
       guidance can be provided by the 62 AW/XPO as required.
       11.4.4. Routine deployments during peacetime. For diplomatic reasons, it’s the responsibility of
       the exchange officer to contact his/her embassy in Washington DC prior to being scheduled for
       extended temporary duty (TDY) overseas. The exchange officer will inform 62 AW/XPO who in
       turn will notify HQ AMC/A8XI.
    11.5. Medical Benefits. IAW AFI 41-115, Authorized Health Care and Health Care Benefits in the
    Military Health Service System (MHSS) and IAW DoD Reciprocal Healthcare Agreements, care will
    be provided to foreign officers based on the Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement with their country. If a
    Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement of the country does not exist, care may be provided on a space
    available basis and the military treatment facility will seek reimbursement from member’s country.
       11.5.1. Upon arrival at McChord, each Canadian member will process through Military Personnel
       Flight, complete DEERS requirements and receive an ID card for member and eligible family
       members. The member will process through the TRICARE Service Center and enroll themselves
       and their family members.
    11.6. End-of-Tour Report. Foreign exchange personnel submit to 62 AW/XPO end-of-tour reports
    according to parent service instructions. The supervisor reviews the submission to check accuracy and
    ensure it does not contain classified or controlled unclassified information. 62 AW/XPO will forward
    it to the 62 AW/CC prior to forwarding it to HQ AMC/A8XI for final review and release to the parent
    service. The end-of-tour report is important to the host and parent governments to validate require-
    ments for future assignment of exchange officers.
62AWI10-4 1 MAY 2007                                                                                     9


12. Visiting Foreign Aircraft.
   12.1. General Information: Foreign Government Owned Aircraft Operating at Air Force Airfields
   operations are governed by AFI 10-1801, Foreign Governmental Aircraft Landings at United States
   Installations. The Air Force Vice Chief of Staff directed a new Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
   concerning the use of Air Force airfields by Foreign Government owned aircraft. The CONOPS
   realigns the responsibility and the POC for these operations from SAF/IAPD to the Associate Director
   for Civil Aviation (AF/XOO-CA) and adds a new layer of coordination with MAJCOMs before For-
   eign Government aircraft are issued an Aircraft Landing Authorization Number (ALAN).
   12.2. ALAN General Rules and Exceptions:
       12.2.1. In order for a foreign government aircraft to land at an Air Force base the aircraft must
       have:
          12.2.1.1. A Diplomatic Clearance issued by the State Department.
          12.2.1.2. An ALAN number issued by AF/XOO-CA.
          12.2.1.3. A Prior Permission Request (PPR) number issued by the landing base (Airfield
          Management Operations at McChord).
       12.2.2. Exception: Canadian government aircraft (including military aircraft). Canada and the
       United States have a reciprocal agreement allowing routine flights by Canadian government/mili-
       tary aircraft through US airspace and/or landing at civil or military airfields. Canadian government
       aircraft do not require a diplomatic clearance or ALAN number; however, a PPR issued by the
       landing base is still required. Canadian government aircraft are the only foreign government air-
       craft operations authorized to contact the base directly for a PPR number. Airfield Management
       Operations should coordinate PPR request through Operations Group staff. Once a PPR is
       assigned, provide aircraft and aircrew information to 62 AW/XPO.
          12.2.2.1. VIPs/Hazardous Materials. This exception to the rule for the Canadians does NOT
          apply for flights that involve VIPs or hazardous material. These type flights do require Diplo-
          matic Clearance and ALAN number and should be referred to AF/XOO-CA through 62 AW/
          XPO if Airfield Management Operations is contacted directly.
          12.2.2.2. There are no exceptions for other countries. If a base is contacted directly, except as
          noted above, refer them to AF/XOO-CA.
          12.2.2.3. The ALAN will generally include statements of services to be provided and pay-
          ment/reimbursement instructions. Civil aircraft landing permits will not occur, nor will land-
          ing, parking and storage fees be charged, as set forth in AFIs 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing
          Permits, and 10-1002, Agreements for Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Airfields, unless speci-
          fied in the SAF/IAD message granting landing authorization. If landing, parking and storage
          fees are charged, the authority must be reported in the billing notice. Answers to specific ques-
          tions regarding these service charges may be extracted from DFAS-DER 7010-3.
          12.2.2.4. Upon receipt of the ALAN authorizing support of these aircraft, McChord AFB will
          be responsible for making every effort to provide the required support as expeditiously as pos-
          sible upon aircraft arrival.
   12.3. Normal Procedures.
10                                                                             62AWI10-4 1 MAY 2007


        12.3.1. In most scenarios, the first contact McChord should receive concerning the landing of a
        foreign government aircraft is from Headquarters Air Mobility Command Current Operations
        Branch, Operations Support (HQ AMC/A3OO) after they are contacted by AF/XOO-CA.
        12.3.2. In most cases, AF/XOO-CA receives the request from the Foreign Government’s embassy
        at least five days prior to the requested landing. After confirming its authenticity and requirement
        with the State Department, the request is forwarded to AMC/A3OO. Once AMC/A3OO approves
        the ALAN, an info copy of the ALAN request is provided to 62 AW/XPO.
        12.3.3. 62 AW/XPO will process the request through group commanders and wing staff as appli-
        cable and pass recommendation(s) to 62 AW/CC for approval/disapproval.
        12.3.4. 62 AW/XPO will pass 62 AW/CC approval/disapproval to HQ AMC/A3OO. If approved,
        AMC/A3OO passes the information back to AF/XOO-CA, who then provides 62 AW/XPO and
        Airfield Management Operations a cover letter (with ALAN number) and the Embassy aircraft
        landing request form. AF/XOO-CA then contacts McChord Airfield Management Operations for
        a PPR number. Once the PPR # is received, the State Department is issued the ALAN number.
        12.3.5. Once all three documents are issued (PPR, ALAN number and Diplomatic Clearance),
        AF/XOO-CA will contact the embassy to advise them that the process is complete and provide the
        ALAN and PPR numbers.
        12.3.6. Some Foreign Government aircraft are issued “blanket” ALAN numbers due to the con-
        tinued requirement to land at Air Force bases over a 1-year period. Though issued a blanket
        ALAN number, these aircraft are still required to process landing requests through AF/XOO-CA.
        If a base is contacted directly for permission to land on a blanket ALAN number, refer them to AF/
        XOO-CA.
        12.3.7. Foreign aircraft may divert into McChord due to weather or emergency and arrive without
        the proper clearance.
            12.3.7.1. In this situation, the Tower and/or Airfield Management Operations should be con-
            tacted by the original landing base and provided the PPR, ALAN number and the Diplomatic
            Clearance once the decision to divert has been made.
            12.3.7.2. If a McChord agency gets a previously uncoordinated inbound on a foreign govern-
            ment aircraft, contact the original landing base and get the necessary information.
            12.3.7.3. All information should be passed to 62 AW/XPO who in turn will disseminate the
            information to base agencies.
     12.4. Responsibilities:
        12.4.1. 62 AW/XPO is the base focal point for the dissemination of information on all foreign
        government aircraft. In this capacity, 62 AW/XPO must be advised of all foreign aircraft transiting
        McChord AFB. 62 AW/XPO will:
            12.4.1.1. Receive, process and coordinate all requests for foreign military or foreign govern-
            ment-owned non-commercial aircraft requesting to land at McChord AFB. These requests
            contain ALANs and other specific information, from AF/XOO-CA to 62 AW/XPO.
            12.4.1.2. Notify appropriate 62 AW organizations and (or) agencies immediately upon receipt
            of the request to ensure that proper planning for tasked support is accomplished. This will
62AWI10-4 1 MAY 2007                                                                                   11


         include estimated time of arrival (ETA), required support requirements (fuel, billeting, trans-
         portation requirements, etc.) and changes to aircraft and (or) mission schedules. If possible, a
         copy of the request should be faxed to each organization and (or) agency involved and (or)
         tasked. There may be times when forwarding copies of the request is not appropriate. For
         example, the request is classified or too cumbersome for multiple copies. In such cases notifi-
         cation shall be made to base agencies and they will make arrangements to pick up the request
         from 62 AW/XPO. The wing organizations requiring notification are:
             12.4.1.2.1. 62 AW/CC/CV

  tary or civilian), at a rank of a 0-6 equivalent or above, 62 AW/XPO will notify 62 AW/CCP and 62
  AW/CC. Planned DV aircraft parking locations and aircraft servicing requirements will be determined
  immediately upon receipt of message notification. DV parking will be coordinated through the 62d
  Maintenance Operations Squadron Maintenance Operations Center (62 MOS/MOC). Dependent upon
  the level and nature of visiting DVs, 62 SFS Operations Flight (62 SFS/SFO) may be tasked to pro-
  vide aircraft security for the period that the aircraft is parked at McChord AFB.
  12.6. Logistics Requirements for Foreign Aircraft Visits to McChord AFB. 62 AW/XPO coordinates
  all incoming logistics requirements for foreign aircraft visits to McChord AFB. If messages and (or)
  taskings for foreign aircraft requesting landing authorization and logistics support are received by any
  other organization, or the 62 AW/XPO is not indicated as information or action addressee, the mes-
  sages and (or) taskings must be copied and delivered to 62 AW/XPO as soon as possible.
12                                                                             62AWI10-4 1 MAY 2007

        12.8.1. Notify 62 LRS/LGRFO of aircraft ETA, parking location, and fuel requirements.
        12.8.2. Occasionally, AF/XOO-CA messages designate that visiting foreign aircraft may request
        fuel, aircraft supplies and additional service requirements and will pay cash for these services.
        Ensure that persons authorized to accept cash are available, when this request is made. As much
        advance notice as possible will be given for this type of payment request.
     12.9. 62 APS/TRO will notify border clearance officials (Customs, Agriculture and Immigration) for
     those aircraft requiring border clearance.
     12.10. 62 AMXS/MXA will:
        12.10.1. Complete an AF IMT 726, Transient Aircraft Service Record, each time they provide
        off-equipment maintenance, parts, lubricants, or oxygen. Transient Alert will ensure all specialists
        furnishing off-equipment maintenance support also complete an AF IMT 726 and provide it to 62
        AMXS/MXA immediately upon completion of their work. The 62 AMXS/MXA Supervisor will
        ensure that each AF IMT 726 is properly completed, assigned a control number and processed
        through the 62 CPTS/FMFL IAW T.O. 00-20-5, paragraph 1-17.
        12.10.2. Ensure that all parts/supplies for foreign aircraft are ordered from the LRS using the 62

        When specialists perform maintenance on subject aircraft, they will advise the 62 AMXS/MXA
        Supervisor of all parts or supplies requirements. This will require prior coordination with the air-
        craft commander or his or her representative to determine whether repairable parts will be given to
        Maintenance for repair and returned to United States Air Force Supply stock, or be retained by the
        foreign country without repair. Maintenance specialists will not order parts/supplies until directed
        to do so by the aircraft commander or his or her representative.
     12.11. 62d Logistics Readiness Squadron Materiel Management Flight will:
        12.11.1. Process Transient Maintenance demands for parts and supplies IAW AFMAN 23-110,
