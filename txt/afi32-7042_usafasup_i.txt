This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70,
Environmental Quality. It identifies compliance requirements for all solid waste (SW), including
hazardous waste (HW), but excludes radioactive waste (except mixed waste) and medical waste.
It applies to individuals at all levels who handle and/or manage waste as described above
including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units except
where noted otherwise. In the United States and its territories, use this guidance with applicable
federal, state, and local standards for SW and HW. At installations outside the United States and
its territories, implement this AFI consistent with applicable international agreements, Unified
Combatant Command (UCC) policy, environmental annexes to operational orders or plans,
country-specific Final Governing Standards (FGS) or, in their absence, the Overseas
Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) (See AFI 32-7006, Environmental
Programs in Foreign Countries, to be replaced by AFI 32-7001). In case of conflict, UCC
policy, the environmental annex, the FGS, or the OEBGD takes precedence over this AFI. Send

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This document revises AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Compliance; changes the title
to reflect that HW is a subset of SW (page 1); incorporates SW management into the pollution
prevention hierarchy; clarifies that retention of waste disposal records must comply with the Air
Force’s Records Disposition Schedule (paragraph 1.6); expands and details Air Force
responsibilities for waste management (section 1B); streamlines HW training requirements
(paragraph 2.6); addresses Resource Conservation and Recovery Act corrective actions
(RCRA-CA) (paragraph 2.11); includes munitions waste disposal (paragraph 2.3.8); includes
mixed waste disposal (paragraph 2.3.7); incorporates the Qualified Recycling Program (QRP)
into the Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) Program (paragraphs 3.1.2 and 3.6.3):
addresses funding proceeds from recycling (paragraph 3.6.3.6); describes Construction and
Demolition (C&D) debris within the ISWM Program (Section 3.8); and adds a new chapter on
managing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) wastes (Chapter 4).

This is the second publication of AFI 32-7042, which substantially revises the initial 1994
publication and focuses on waste management to enhance mission capability while ensuring
compliance by sustaining, restoring, and modernizing the natural, built, and workforce
infrastructure. The organization of this AFI has been revised to conform to the organization of
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                                                                             3


other environmental AFIs, and to provide a concise framework for compliance with waste
management regulatory requirements. Additionally, this AFI has been revised to align with the
Air Force Environmental Management System (EMS) framework.

                                       INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Concept. Inherent in the mission of the Air Force are the associated environmental
responsibilities of protecting human health and the environment, and ably managing the natural
resources whose care has been entrusted to the Air Force. In accordance with RCRA, the Air
Force will have a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste generated. This
will be done first through source reduction, e.g., chemical substitution, process change, and other
techniques to reduce generation of HW. Where environmentally damaging materials must be
used, their use will be minimized. If the use of such materials cannot be avoided, the spent
material or waste will be reused or recycled whenever feasible. As a last resort, spent material or
waste that cannot be reused or recycled must be disposed of in an environmentally safe manner,
consistent with the requirements of all applicable laws, including RCRA. SW and HW
management interrelates, or has the potential to interrelate, with the management of many other
environmental programs (e.g., air, water, natural resource programs). In addition, the
consequences of managing SW and HW can affect the health and safety of an installation’s
workforce. To this end, it is imperative that the SW and HW management program defined in
this AFI be conducted as an integral component of an installation’s EMS as defined in higher
headquarters’ EMS-related policies, procedures, and guidance documents.
1.2. Scope. This AFI describes the Air Forces’s management of municipal solid waste (MSW),
industrial solid waste, construction and demolition (C&D) debris, hazardous waste, and PCB
waste. This AFI does not address radioactive waste (RW) (except mixed waste) or medical
waste. RW is addressed in AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the Air Force.
Medical waste is addressed in AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineering Programs. Under the
Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded that
medical waste presents more of an occupational concern than a generalized environmental
concern. However, some medical waste can be deemed hazardous and as such, this waste should
be handled as a HW under the RCRA regulations.
1.3. Objectives. This instruction provides MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and installations a
framework for complying with standards applicable to SW and HW management. Installations
must also comply with applicable state and local standards.
1.4. Applicable Standards and Regulations. The AF complies with applicable federal, state,
and local laws and regulations; Executive Orders (EO); US Department of Defense (DoD) and
AF policies; and the OEBGD, appropriate FGS, and international agreements. See Attachment 2
for list of pertinent statutes and regulations.
1.5. Overseas Compliance. Air Force activities in foreign countries must implement this AFI
consistent with applicable international agreements, UCC policy, environmental annexes to
operational orders or plans, and country-specific FGS or, in their absence, the OEBGD. In case
of conflict, UCC policy, the environmental annex, the FGS, or the OEBGD takes precedence
over this AFI. In the event of conflict notify HQ USAF/A7CA through the appropriate
MAJCOM. AFI 32-7006 (to be replaced by AFI 32-7001) describes the Air Force environmental
program in foreign countries.

                   HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

Section 2A—Planning

2.1. General Requirements.
   2.1.1. HW. A HW is a substance first determined to be a SW, as defined in 40 Code of
   Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 261.2 that has not been excluded from EPA HW regulations
   and is either a characteristic HW (i.e., ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic) or a listed HW
   (listed on the F, K, P, or U lists at Title 40, CFR, Part 261.31-.33), or is identified as a HW
   by authorized state or host nation requirements incorporated into the FGS. Air Force
   installations comply with all applicable HW standards and regulations (see section 1.4).
   There are many exceptions to waste being considered RCRA HW, with household waste
   being one of them. This AFI cannot address all exempted wastes.
   2.1.2. The installation commander is responsible for complying with laws governing HW
   disposal from all activities on base. Management and disposal of HW by the DRMO or by
   contractors does not relieve the installation commander of this responsibility.
      2.1.2.1. The installation ESOHC will support the installation commander to oversee
      compliance with HW laws per AFI 90-801, Environment, Safety, and Occupational
      Health Councils (ESOHC).
      2.1.2.2. Regardless of who disposes of HW from an installation, or signs the HW
      manifest, the installation commander is ultimately responsible for the proper final
      disposal of HW and the accuracy of the HW manifest.
   2.1.3. Installations submit programming and budgeting needs for facilities, equipment, and
   manpower per AFI 32-7001, Environmental Quality Program, and AFI 65-106,
   Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) and
   Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS).
   2.1.4. Installations must have a hazardous waste minimization program to reduce the volume
   and toxicity of waste generated IAW RCRA Section 3002(b), 42 U.S.C. 6922(b). Preference
   should be given to source reduction. The Hazardous material process authorization under the
   Installation Hazardous Material Program (IHMP) is a method, per AFI 32-7086, to document
   compliance with above requirement.
   2.1.5. Installations must strive to eliminate the need for RCRA permits for HW storage,
   treatment, or disposal, where feasible. Any new initiatives that will require a RCRA permit
   for on-site activities must be coordinated with HQ USAF/A7CA through the appropriate
   MAJCOM Asset Management and/or Civil Engineering function.
   2.1.6. Installations with RCRA permits for HW storage, treatment, or disposal must comply
   with those permits. In the event of a conflict, permit requirements supersede this instruction.
   2.1.7. Installations that generate HW must have a HW management program that ensures
   compliance with this instruction and all applicable federal, state, and local laws and
   regulations; executive orders; DoD and Air Force policies; and, if applicable, the OEBGD,
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                             15


   FGS, and/or international agreements. The program will include: HWMP, training,
   characterization, turn-in and disposal procedures, disposal contracts, inspections, munitions,
   mixed waste, permits and recordkeeping (includes compliance with RCRA-CA
   requirements), and host-tenant support.
   2.1.8. Installations and Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) that qualify as Conditionally
   Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG) under RCRA, and maintain that status for at
   least a year, do not have to meet the AF-specific requirements of this Chapter as long as they
   meet the minimum RCRA regulations applicable to CESQG. Exemptions are Sections 2.4,
   2.8.2, and 2.9.2, which must be considered, regardless of generator status.
2.2. Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
   2.2.1. The HWMP will reflect current regulatory requirements and installation HW
   activities.
   2.2.2. The ESOHC will review and approve the plan annually.
   2.2.3. The HWMP must contain, at a minimum, a waste inventory, waste analysis plan
   (WAP), HW management procedures, reporting procedures, training plan, waste
   minimization plan, a pollution prevention plan, and a reference to the installation
   preparedness and spill prevention plan or equivalent plan, to include the HW contingency
   plan. The HWMP will reference these applicable plans prepared independent of the HWMP.
      2.2.3.1. If the DRMO acts as the disposal agent, the HWMP must also address the HW
      turn-in requirements in U.S. Department of Defense Manual (DoDM) DoD 4160.21-M,
      Defense Materiel Disposition Manual.
2.3. Waste Characterization and Identification.
   2.3.1. Waste generating activities will be coordinated with the CE to ensure that waste
   streams are properly characterized IAW 40 CFR Part 261, applicable DoD, state, and local
   regulations, and FGS requirements, or OEBGD in the absence of approved FGS. Activities
   will coordinate with BE to determine any occupational or environmental health risk related to
   their wastes. Each installation will prepare a WAP that will include a Hazardous Waste
   Stream Inventory (HWSI) and descriptions on a HWPS.
   2.3.2. The WAP identifies hazardous waste streams and sets forth procedures, including
   specific sampling methods, necessary to ensure proper HW treatment, storage, or disposal.
   The WAP must be kept on-site. At a minimum, the WAP must include the wastes that were
   evaluated and analyzed, a description of the testing and analytical methods used, the HW
   sampling methods used, the location of samples taken for analysis and frequency, sample
   documentation, sample quality assurance and quality control procedures, and sample request
   procedures.
      2.3.2.1. The WAP should document the reevaluation frequency for installation waste
      streams to ensure their characteristics have not substantially changed. The WAP should
      include a description of the re-evaluation procedures and require re-characterization each
      waste stream when the generating process or operation is changed.
      2.3.2.2. Document chemical and physical analysis for each waste stream sampled and
      retain IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records.
 16                                                AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


   2.3.3. HWSI describes all HW streams generated. Installations must have a HWSI that lists
   at least the generating activity’s identity and location, unique waste stream number, and the
   waste characteristics (e.g., EPA waste code, and state waste code).
   2.3.4. Installations will document the waste stream description on DRMS Form 1930,
   Hazardous Waste Profile Sheet or HAF/DRMS-approved variant.
   2.3.5. Handle all potentially hazardous, yet uncharacterized wastes, as HW as required by
   applicable federal, state, or local regulations, and FGS requirements, or OEBGD in the
   absence of approved FGS, pending determination.
   2.3.6. Universal Waste. Federally designated universal wastes include batteries, pesticides,
   mercury-containing equipment, and lamps.
      2.3.6.1. The AF encourages the recycling of universal waste IAW 40 CFR Part 273,
      however, the decision for implementing a recycling program IAW federal, state, and
      local standards will be the responsibility of the installations.
      2.3.6.2. Universal waste regulations streamline HW management standards for these
      wastes to encourage treatment and recycling programs, and to reduce the quantity of
      these wastes going to MSW landfills or combustors.
   2.3.7. Mixed Waste (MW). MW consists of waste containing HW and radioactive material.
      2.3.7.1. Installations that generate MW must comply with RCRA HW disposal, Atomic
      Energy Act (AEA), State and USAF disposal requirements. MW can be generated during
      nuclear weapons maintenance activities governed under AEA Section 91b. The Air Force
      Safety Center (AFSC) provides 91b policy under AFI 91-108, Air Force Nuclear
      Weapons Intrinsic Radiation and 91B Radioactive Material Safety Program‖. Consult
      AFI 91-108 for nuclear weapons related MW disposal requirements. Consult AFI 40-201,
      Managing Radioactive Material in the US Air Force, for RW and MW disposal
      requirements not related to nuclear weapons maintenance. CE will advise on RCRA
      requirements as applicable to storage/handling of MW.
      2.3.7.2. All installations will coordinate the disposal of RW and MW with the
      Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO), who will in turn, coordinate with the Air
      Force Radioactive Recycling and Disposal (AFRRAD) office, 88 ABW/CEV, Wright-
      Patterson AFB, OH. The AFRRAD office responsibilities are outlined in AFI 40-201,
      and it is the sole agent for disposal of AF MW and RW.
   2.3.8. Military Munitions. All conventional explosive ordnance, whether it remains
   useable/serviceable or has been designated as unserviceable, will be managed IAW DoD
   6055.9- STD, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, October 5, 2004, and DoD
   Policy to Implement the EPA’s Military Munitions Rule, 1 July 1998, relayed per
   memorandum from HQ USAF/A4 (previously IL), dated November 2, 1998.
      2.3.8.1. Military munitions that are SW or HW for regulatory purposes will be stored and
      disposed of IAW applicable state and federal regulations, DoD and Air Force guidance,
      and the Military Munitions Rule found at 40 CFR Part 264/265 Subpart EE and Part 266
      Subpart M as appropriate.
2.4. Disposal Contracts.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                             17


   2.4.1. See paragraph 2.9.2.3 for policy on local contracts. When approved, local contracts
   must be performance-based IAW AFI 63-124, Performance-Based Services Acquisition
   (PBSA). Consult the servicing contracting office for assistance. Note: AFI 63-124 does not
   apply to the Air National Guard‖. Consult with OCS on best approach.
   2.4.2. Ensure that any installation contracts for HW disposal which are allowed per Section
   2.9.2.3 will not conflict with provisions of an existing DRMO contract or result in breach of
   a DRMO contract.
      2.4.2.1. All local contract development will be coordinated with the contracting officer,
      Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), installation environmental manager, and installation civil
      engineer.
          2.4.2.1.1. The SJA and the installation environmental manager will review these
          documents before sending them to the Contracting Officer (CO) to ensure that the
          documents follow applicable DoD, federal, state, and local regulations and
          requirements.
          2.4.2.1.2. The SJA will determine if the contractor must maintain insurance to cover
          liabilities associated with improper HW transportation, treatment, or disposal. At a
          minimum, contracts should require indemnification of the government by the
          contractor.
   2.4.3. The evaluation team must evaluate all offerors’ compliance records when selecting a
   source for HW transport and disposal services. Evaluate all proposed HW transport
   contractors in the same manner. MAJCOMs must develop procedures to evaluate contract
   performance and oversight requirements associated with the disposition (treatment and
   disposal or recycling) of HW, especially for local contracts separate from the DRMS.
   MAJCOMs and installations should ensure adequate management controls and waivers are in
   place and documents available for installations not using the DRMS for HW disposal. The
   checklist and references provided at Attachment 3 can help installations in this endeavor.
2.5. Host-Tenant Support.
   2.5.1. The Air Force supports the HW disposal needs of both Air Force and DoD tenants on
   Air Force installations.
   2.5.2. For intraservice support (including Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and the Air National
   Guard), host Air Force installations plan and fund for their tenants’ HW disposal needs,
   unless paragraph 2.5.4 applies.
   2.5.3. Tenants must follow all laws and regulations applicable to the installation as well as
   the installation HWMP, and provide input and submit reports that the HWMP requires.
      2.5.3.1. When tenants do not comply with HW laws, the installation commander may
      take any action needed to require tenants (and their contractors) to comply at no charge to
      the government.
      2.5.3.2. Tenants responsible for HW management facilities that require permitting must
      coordinate with the host-installation. The tenant then signs as ―operator‖ and the
      installation commander signs as ―owner‖.
 18                                                  AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


   2.5.4. The tenant will reimburse the installation IAW AFI 65-601 Volume 1, for all waste
   disposal costs that exceed $125 for any calendar quarter and as documented in a host-tenant
   agreement. If a tenant organization’s accumulated charges do not exceed $125 per calendar
   quarter, the installation can use its discretion to waive billing the tenant. EXCEPTIONS: All
   Defense Working Capitally Funded (DWCF) Air Force tenants and Services activities are not
   eligible for a billing waiver and must pay their operation and maintenance expenses,
   including HW disposal costs. Also, AFI 65-601 requires Air Force Research Laboratory
   (AFRL) workload users and Designated Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) test
   mission proponents to fund the direct costs of activities that are measureable and directly
   attributed to conduct of a RTDE or test mission. HW management and disposition costs
   attributed to an AFRL or MRTFB activity are to be funded by the proponent‖.
   2.5.5. For interservice/interagency support of a DoD component or agency tenant (including
   component organizations of other DoD departments and agencies and component
   organizations of non-DoD departments and agencies, respectively), host installations will
   seek reimbursement for HW disposal costs for on- and off-installation tenants, following the
   procedures in AFI 65-601, Volume 1.
   2.5.6. If a tenant function is contracted out, this section still applies as the contracted-tenant
   function would still be considered a tenant function under Air Force policy. The tenant
   organization still has oversight for that contract function. However, this section does not
   apply to host-contracted functions, which would be subject to other appropriate sections in
   this AFI.

Section 2B—Implementation and Operation.

2.6. Training.
   2.6.1. All personnel whose work involves HW and their immediate supervisors must receive
   and successfully complete HW training appropriate to their job responsibilities. Training will
   occur within three months of an employee’s arrival or assignment to HW-related duties. Until
   the employee has received the appropriate HW training, the employee may only handle HW
   under the supervision of a HW trained individual. Supervisors and personnel must also
   successfully complete annual refresher training. Those working at TSDFs and cleanup sites
   also need to adhere to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous
   Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER).
      2.6.1.1. Personnel preparing HW for shipment must receive Department of
      Transportation (DOT) training applicable to the level of the work as prescribed by the
      DOT regulations IAW 49 CFR Subpart H, Training, and the Defense Transportation
      Regulation (DTR) DoD Regulation 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 204, Hazardous Materials,
      as follows:
          2.6.1.1.1. Persons who certify HAZMAT on shipping papers by any mode of
          transportation, with the exception of Technical Specialists, must successfully
          complete an initial 80-hour HAZMAT certification course;
          2.6.1.1.2. Persons who only certify HW shipments (that is, authorized by the
          installation commander to certify USEPA HW manifests and shipping papers) shall
          successfully complete the training IAW paragraph D.1.c.(2) in DTR DoDR 4500.9-R,
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                                19


          Part II, Chapter 204, or AF-approved equivalent, in lieu of the 80-hour requirement
          above; and
          2.6.1.1.3. Refresher training for HW personnel involved with certifying HW for
          shipment will be IAW training frequency specified in DTR DoD Regulation 4500.9-
          R-Part II.
   2.6.2. Supervisors shall examine employee training to ensure that adequate site- and task-
   specific familiarization is accomplished, and supplemented with on-the-job training, as
   needed.
   2.6.3. HW generators must retain personnel training records and those of former employees
   IAW Air Force RDS (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/), Environmental
   and Natural Resources Data Training. Copies of certification of HW training must be on-site
   and available for inspection. Originals of these records may be kept by AF Form 1098,
   Special Task Certification and Recurring Training; AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
   Health Record; installation centralized training records; computer database; or letters of
   completion.
      2.6.3.1. At a minimum, training records should include the student’s name, job title, job
      description, previous HW training, dates of training, instructor’s name (or functional
      area), test score (if applicable), and date of annual refresher course.
   2.6.4. MAJCOM/Installations must give priority to using HAF-approved HW education/
   training sources such as AFIT HW Course WENV 521 and WESS 010 HW Accumulation
   Satellite seminar, and the AF HW web-based training and the official AF-approved
   computer/web-based training.
2.7. Permits, Recordkeeping, and Reporting.
   2.7.1. The installation commander will sign environmental permit applications; this is non-
   delegable. The facility permits shall remain the responsibility of the installation commander
   as ―owner‖. For installations outside the US and US territories, the host commander or host
   nation representative may be the signing authority.
      2.7.1.1. The installation commander or designated representative will sign a hard copy of
      the manifests that track off-installation HW shipment and LDR certification.
      2.7.1.2. Installations will send their MAJCOM and the appropriate Air Force Regional
      Environmental Office a copy of each signed HW permit.
   2.7.2. Installations will track HW with the EPA HW manifest (or approved documentation)
   and report HW management activities using the approved standard Air Force automated HW
   system.
   2.7.3. Installations will retain all notices, certifications, manifests, and waste analyses IAW
   AFMAN 33-363 from the date the HW was shipped to a TSDF or DRMO IAW the Air Force
   RDS. Installations with Part B permitted TSDFs must maintain all documentation of wastes
   managed at the facility and all facility records past the closure of the facility and IAW the Air
   Force RDS.
   2.7.4. Maintain all HW disposal records and report HW information IAW Air Force policy
   and data reporting requirements.

2.8. Accumulation.
   2.8.1. Accumulate HW IAW applicable DoD, federal, state, and local laws and regulations,
   as well as FGS requirements.
      2.8.1.1. An initial accumulation point (satellite accumulation area) is an accumulation
      area at or near the point of generation, which is under the control of the operator of the
      process generating the waste. Accumulation may continue at an initial accumulation point
      until 55 gallons of HW or 1 quart of acute HW is collected. If the generator accumulates
      HW or acute HW in excess of these amounts, the generator must mark the container with
      the date the amount was exceeded and transfer the HW container to a HWAS
      (90/180/270-day, centralized Accumulation Area, etc.) or TSDF within three consecutive
      days, or as dictated by state and local regulations.
      2.8.1.2. A HWAS is a centralized location where wastes from several generating
      activities are placed for up to 90 days for large quantity generators, and 180 or 270 days
      for small quantity generators as appropriate or as dictated by local regulation or FGS.
      2.8.1.3. Installations will maintain the minimal number of initial accumulation points and
      accumulation sites necessary to perform their mission and meet regulatory requirements.
      2.8.1.4. Each waste-generating functional area shall appoint a primary and alternate site
      manager for each initial accumulation point and/or accumulation site.
      2.8.1.4. (USAFA) Appointment of primary and alternate site managers shall be signed
      by the functional area supervisor.
   2.8.2. Installations are prohibited from the management of non-DoD toxic or HW, or the
   storage or disposal of non-DoD toxic or HW on DoD installations (10 U.S.C. 2692, U.S.
   Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4715.6, D.4.10.). Non-DoD toxic or HW is waste
   generated or stored for activities not related to DoD missions and operations. Exceptions may
   be allowed for overseas bases subject to an international agreement or a Status of Forces
   Agreement (SOFA). The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Environment) may grant
   exceptions when essential to protect the health and safety of the public from imminent danger
   (e.g., temporary storage or disposal of non- DoD explosives) (10 U.S.C. 2692(b)). SAF/IE
   may make determinations of applicable exemptions to this requirement.
   Installations/MAJCOM shall follow the exception approval process of AFI 32- 9003,
   Granting Temporary Use Of Air Force Real Property, (Paragraph 1.20; Outgrants for Storing
   and Disposing of Non-DoD-Owned Hazardous or Toxic Materials). Also, for non-DoD
   explosive material management installations shall follow AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety
   Standards.
      2.8.2.1. When the non-DoD waste meets exception criteria or an exception is granted,
      the waste’s owner must prepare and obtain all needed permits, licenses or leases, meet all
      financial requirements, and prepare required environmental documentation, including
      manifests, before using Air Force property. Also, the base must get a written, signed
      agreement with the owner of the non-DoD waste with appropriate provisions, such as
      leaving the facility in its original condition, indemnifying the AF, covering the costs of
      any cleanup required, etc.
2.9. Turn-in and Disposal Procedures.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                              21


   2.9.1. For HAZMAT.
       2.9.1.1. Installations must ensure maximum reuse of HAZMAT prior to disposal. For
       details on handling excess HAZMAT and ozone depleting substances (ODS), see AFI 32-
       7086, Hazardous Materials Management.
       2.9.1.2. HAZMARTs must oversee HAZMAT reuse efforts until turned into DRMO.
       Installations must ensure that HAZMAT given to the DRMO for RTDS or disposal meets
       the requirements of DoD 4160.21-M.
       2.9.1.3. Installations must ensure that HAZMAT that is deemed unusable or has failed
       DRMS’s RTDS program, is disposed of properly.
       2.9.1.4. For proper turn-in and disposal, installations must attach Hazard Communication
       (HAZCOM) standard compliant labels and material safety data sheet (MSDS)
       information. Without these items, DRMO will dispose of any HAZMAT as a HW, and
       the generator will be held responsible for the disposal costs.
       2.9.1.5. Installations must not issue, ship, use, or dispose of improperly labeled
       HAZMAT.
   2.9.2. For HW.
       2.9.2.1. Installations will follow turn-in procedures in DoD 4160.21-M.
       2.9.2.2. Installations must ensure all HW is weighed in the presence of a government-
       appointed official before removal from the installation for shipment to a TSDF.
       2.9.2.3. Installations will use DRMS as the DoD HW disposal agent for routinely
       generated HW or HW from base operations not connected to a specific contract, unless
       there is a compelling reason to use contract disposal or per the exemptions listed in
       paragraph 2.9.2.4 Installations may contract for HW disposal if the commander provides
       appropriate justification, and the MAJCOM CE (A7C) or A7 approves the waiver. A7 or
       A7C may delegate in writing the responsibility to the Chief of the Asset Management
       Division.
       2.9.2.4. HW from contracted cleanup/remediation projects or construction/demolition
       and renovation contracts are not required to go through DRMO for disposal. HW
       recycling, including universal waste is not considered disposal and can be independently
       contracted as long as legitimate recycling is consistent with EPA’s P2 hierarchy. For
       these types of contracts performed locally (under the control of installation contracting),
       the base will comply with appropriate requirements of Section 2.4 of this AFI to ensure
       legitimate recycling and compliant recycling facilities are being used. MAJCOMs must
       document management controls for recycling.

Section 2C—Checking and Corrective Action.

2.10. Inspections.
   2.10.1. Perform internal and external environmental compliance assessments IAW AFI 32-
   7045, Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) or the
   most current version of the ECAMP AFI.
 22                                                 AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


   2.10.2. Installation CE will conduct no-notice inspections of HW generation, accumulation,
   storage, and disposal activities at least once per year.
2.11. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act-Corrective Action.
   2.11.1. The RCRA-CA program is a cleanup program designed to ensure the remediation of
   hazardous waste, low-level radioactive material, petroleum, oils, lubricants, other waste
   pollutants, and contaminants associated with known releases located at US installations only.
   The RCRA-CA process is used to evaluate the nature and extent of contamination, identify
   the physical and geographic characteristics of the SW management units, and identify,
   develop, and implement appropriate corrective measures. See the interim U.S. Air Force
   RCRA Corrective Action Guide http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/eq/rcra/caguide/index.asp
   for further guidance and latest AFI 32- 7020, The Environmental Restoration Program.
   2.11.2. The RCRA-CA program is a requirement for installations in the US and US
   territories only.
       2.11.2.1. CE will ensure adequately coordinated RCRA-CA program including permits,
       land use restrictions, and binding agreements with regulatory agencies. Legal community,
       BE, and public affairs are key partners.
       2.11.2.2. Public information should be a key ingredient of the RCRA-CA program. The
       public should be kept informed as follows:
          2.11.2.2.1. Informing the public of documents available for review and the methods
          for viewing or obtaining them.
          2.11.2.2.2. Ensuring that documents can be understood by educated lay people.
          2.11.2.2.3. Coordinating with BE any communications to the public regarding health
          effects and health risks.
       2.11.2.3. Ensure that clean-ups are estimated using an Air Force-approved cost
       estimating tool. Maintain documentation of those estimates used for budgeting and
       financial reporting. Financial reporting will require management controls to be in place in
       order to report (cost to complete) data for environmental liability reporting.
       2.11.2.4. Ensure a cleanup program consistent with a ―one cleanup‖ approach for all
       installation clean-up as laid out in the new AFI 32-7020.
2.12. Payment of Fines and Penalties. The installation SJA will coordinate with their
MAJCOM, Regional Counsel, and AFLOA/JACE when authorizing installation personnel to
commence negotiations with state or local regulators concerning an enforcement action or other
compliance matter. The Installation SJA will remain informed or involved in all significant
aspects of the negotiations and will continue to coordinate with MAJCOM and appropriate
Regional Counsel.
   2.12.1. When settling a state or local enforcement action that includes a penalty, the
   settlement must be memorialized in a written agreement. The written agreement must be
   forwarded through MAJCOM to AFLOA/JACE. AFLOA/JACE will coordinate with
   SAF/GCN and DOJ, as required by current policy.
   2.12.2. No consent order with state or local regulators will be entered into that provides for
   any penalty or the payment of any amount without prior coordination with AFLOA/JACE.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                        23


   2.12.3. The payment of fines or amounts for supplemental environmental projects (SEP) are
   not eligible for funding by the Environmental O&M accounts.
2.13. Metrics. Ensure metrics are established consistent with DoD policy to check and report
on the effectiveness of meeting the objectives of the program.

             INTEGRATED SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

Section 3A—Planning

3.1. General Requirements.
   3.1.1. Installations will implement ISWM in the most cost effective manner possible while
   meeting all applicable Air Force, DoD, Federal, local, and FGS non-hazardous waste
   diversion and recycling requirements.
   3.1.2. Installations will make every practical effort to maximize non-hazardous SW and
   C&D diversion from landfills or incinerators through reuse, donation, recycling, QRPs,
   composting and mulching, or other waste diversion activities to optimize reduction in both
   the volume of solid waste disposed and overall cost of non-hazardous solid waste
   management.
   3.1.3. SW manager will make systematic waste diversion or disposal decisions based on the
   DoD ISWM hierarchy: source reduction, reuse, donation, recycling, composting/mulching,
   incineration with energy recovery, incineration for volume reduction, other forms of volume
   reduction and finally landfill disposal.
   3.1.4. An installation recycling program consists of handling, storage, collection, disposal,
   record keeping, and reporting.
      3.1.4.1. Whenever possible, installations should conduct direct sales of recyclable
      commodities through an installation QRP. A QRP requires the additional program
      components of funding; economic and business analysis; and proceeds distribution and
      management. See section 3.6.3 for more information in the QRP.
      3.1.4.2. Installations are required to strive to divert/recycle items including, but not
      limited to, plastic, metals, glass, used oil, batteries, and tires. Justify lack of recycling
      efforts in the QRP Business Plan required in 3.6.3.4 (see Table 3.1 for list of QRP-
      eligible items)
   3.1.5. Non-hazardous solid waste requirements for installations located in foreign countries
   are provided in the appropriate international agreements and the appropriate FGS or, in their
   absence, OEBGD, or applicable sections of this AFI.
3.2. Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan.
   3.2.1. Installations must have a complete ISWM Plan. The ISWM Plan contains guidance for
   managing MSW, compost materials, C&D debris, and ISW. An ISWM Plan supports the
   development and implementation of state plans required by RCRA Subtitle D.
   3.2.2. All ISWM Plans must be reviewed annually, updated as appropriate, and approved by
   the installation ESOHC. Regulatory-required ISWM Plans must be approved and signed by a
   representative authorized to obligate the installation.

      clearing (suspense) account balances and ensure appropriated recycling costs are
      reimbursed appropriately.
      3.3.5.5. MAJCOMs must establish procedures for installations to ensure they meet the
      requirements set forth in Section 3.6.3.5.3.
   3.3.6. Owners or operators of MSW landfill (MSWLF) units must comply with the
   recordkeeping requirements of 40 CFR Part 258.29, or the Air Force RDS, whichever is
   more stringent.
3.4. Handling, Storage, and Collection.
   3.4.1. Installations will ensure that receptacles, collection routes, collection schedules, and
   collection equipment (trucks/trailers) meet 40 CFR Part 243, Guidelines for the Storage and
   Collection of Residential, Commercial and Institutional Solid Waste, DoDI 4715.4, as well as
   state, local, and FGS requirements, or OEBGD in the absence of approved FGS.
      3.4.1.1. Installations, or their designated contractors, will ensure all permits needed for
      SW, material recovery facilities and composting handling, storage, and collection
      (including SW transfer facilities) are obtained, and performs any required maintenance
      activities.
      3.4.1.2. Installations will ensure all federally-owned vehicles collecting and transporting
      SW meet all applicable federal regulations, including motor carrier safety standards (49
      CFR Part 390, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations), noise-emission standards for
      motor carriers in interstate commerce (40 CFR Part 202, Motor Carriers Engaged in
      Interstate Commerce), and federal motor vehicle safety standards (49 CFR Part 580,
      Odometer Disclosure Requirements) only for collection equipment.
      3.4.1.3. SW and composting collection equipment must meet the standards of the
      American National Standards Institute in addition to 40 CFR Part 243 and DoDI 4715.4
      requirements.
   3.4.2. The installation commander can select military personnel, civilian personnel, or
   contractors as recycling or composting collection personnel. When a contractor is utilized to
   collect recyclables or compost materials, the contractor’s statement of where to place the
   materials and the timing of when the materials will be picked-up must meet all applicable
   DoD, federal, state, local, and FGS requirements or OEBGD in the absence of approved
   FGS.
   3.4.3. Installations will ensure that all scrap metals, instruments, and related recyclable
   materials sold, or disposed, by direct contract in lieu of processing through the DRMO are
   considered for radiation survey prior to release from the installation, especially metal parts
   from weapons systems.
   3.4.4. All SW originating from outside the United States must be segregated and disposed of
   IAW Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed
   Forces, para.1.14. This includes things that were not a waste at the point of embarkation but
   became a waste en route to the United States, e.g. flight meals. Garbage containing foreign
   food wastes is regulated by the Department of Agriculture and must be placed in leak proof,
   covered containers and disposed of following port procedures authorized by, or under
   surveillance of, a USDA representative.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                                 27


3.5. Municipal Solid Waste.
   3.5.1. Installation MSW management will include a recycling program that will strive to
   divert as much MSW as economically and technically practical, and at a minimum, in
   accordance with 40 CFR Part 246.200-1, Part 201-1, and Part 202-1 and any state, local, or
   FGS requirements or OEBGD in the absence of approved FGS. An installation-recycling
   program consists of handling, storage, collection, sales, record keeping, and reporting.
      3.5.1.1. IAW 40 CFR Part 246.100(f), any installation that has determined, for whatever
      reason, that they will not follow the requirements of 40 CFR Parts 246.200-1, 201-1, and
      202-1 must submit a report to the USEPA Administrator detailing the analysis and
      rationale used in making that determination. The report must be sent through the
      MAJCOM/CEV/A7CA to HQ USAF/A7CA for submission to USEPA, after which the
      USEPA Administrator will then publish the report in the federal register. The following
      are considered by the USEPA to be valid reasons for not source separating under the
      individual facts and circumstances: inability to sell the recovered materials due to lack
      of market and costs so unreasonably high as to render source separation for materials
      recovery economically impracticable. The report must include a description of alternative
      actions considered with emphasis on those alternatives that involve source separation for
      materials recovery.
   3.5.2. Installations will integrate waste reduction solutions into ISWM, to include MSW, in
   the most cost effective manner possible.
   3.5.3. Municipal Solid Waste Disposal. Installations must dispose of MSW in a permitted,
   secure landfill or other state-approved site, such as a thermal-processing facility, and must
   verify permits and licenses for off-base landfills, incinerators, and thermal treatment facilities
   used for disposal.
      3.5.3.1. If a decision is made to use an on-site disposal option, then construction and
      operation must follow all applicable DoD, federal, state, local, and FGS requirements or
      OEBGD in the absence of approved FGS.
      3.5.3.2. Installations must obtain siting authorization, permits, and licenses to construct
      and operate an on-base MSW landfill or thermal treatment facility. For specific
      guidelines, see 40 CFR Part 240 (Guidelines for the Thermal Processing of Solid Wastes)
      for thermal processing of MSW and 40 CFR Part 258 (Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste
      Landfills) for siting and design of MSW landfills.
      3.5.3.3. Before closing an on-base landfill, plan adequate lead-time for meeting post-
      closure requirements. The post-closure period is typically 30 years for maintenance and
      groundwater monitoring. Post-closure procedures may require long-term operation of
      leachate collection and treatment systems or a system for extracting landfill gas.
3.6. Solid Waste Diversion.
   3.6.1. Installations will strive to divert as much of their SW stream in the most cost-effective
   manner possible, keeping in mind the cost savings and cost avoidance from diverting SW
   from landfill disposal.
28                                                 AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


  3.6.2. Legal Recycling Requirements. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 246.200-1, 201-1,
  and 202-1, the following mandatory items must be recycled under the following
  circumstances:
     3.6.2.1. Installations with office facilities with greater than 100 office workers must
     separate high-grade paper at the source of generation, collect it separately and sell it for
     the purpose of recycling.
     3.6.2.2. Installations with greater than 500 families in residence must separate used
     newspaper at the source of residential generation, collect it separately, and sell it for the
     purpose of recycling.
         3.6.2.2.1. Public Private Ventures (PPV) or privatized housing developments that are
         not considered federal entities cannot be held to the installation’s ISWM Plan or
         recycling requirements unless the lessee has agreed to abide by the installation’s
         regulations through a written agreement. (PPV housing developments that are not
         considered federal entities are subject to the local and/or municipal solid waste laws
         and regulations).
         3.6.2.2.1. (USAFA) USAFA Military Family Housing is privatized and is exempt
         from compliance with the ISWMP.
     3.6.2.3. Installations that generate greater than 10 or more tons of waste corrugated
     cardboard containers per month must separately collect it and sell it for the purpose of
     recycling.
     3.6.2.4. Installations will strive to divert other non-hazardous solid waste materials such
     as, but not limited to, metals, plastic, glass, used oil, tires, and batteries. (See Table 3.1
     for list of QRP- eligible items).
     3.6.2.5. Installations will conduct annual opportunity assessments of their SW stream to
     identify source reduction potential and additional recyclable materials.
  3.6.3. QRPs. Installations that intend to sell recyclable materials directly and retain the
  proceeds, must operate their recycling program as a QRP IAW 10 U.S.C. 2577, 32 CFR Part
  172 (b), and DoD QRP policies.
     3.6.3.1. The QRP must comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws and
     requirements; Executive Orders; DoD and AF policies.
     3.6.3.2. The installation commander is responsible for the implementation of a QRP and
     must designate a QRP manager IAW 1.10.1.9 by issuing a QRP designation/appointment
     letter. The installation ESOHC will work with the installation commander to oversee the
     QRP.
     3.6.3.3. The lack of an existent and related warrant by the installation contracting
     organization does not preclude the sale of eligible items by the QRP, either directly or
     through DRMS. The QRP, and by extension the designated QRP manager, may only
     conduct sales for any QRP eligible items with anticipated sales proceeds of $15,000 or
     less. Recyclable items sales exceeding $15,000 must be conducted IAW 40 USC 484 and
     41 CFR 102-38.105, Federal Property Management Regulations.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                            29


     3.6.3.4. QRP Organization. Installations with QRPs will have a single QRP to serve all
     AF and tenant organizations occupying space on the installation.
        3.6.3.4.1. QRP Manager. The QRP manager is the single point of contact for all
        aspects of the QRP.     All recycling sections (appropriated funded activities,
        Services, Army AF Exchange Service (AAFES), and Defense Commissary Agency
        (DeCA)) will forward appropriate recycling/diversion and proceeds data and
        information to the QRP manager as required.
        3.6.3.4.2. AF working capital funded (AFWCF) activities have the option of
        operating their own QRP or processing their recyclables through the installation QRP
        by Memorandum of Agreement if determined that recycling their own scrap is not
        economical. However, installation QRP cannot retain sales proceeds from the sale of
        AFWCF scrap. All AFWCF scrap proceeds must be returned to the US Treasury.
        3.6.3.4.3. The installation QRP will be an umbrella organization, consisting of up to
        four separate recycling organizations: an appropriated funds activity, a Services
        (nonappropriated funds [NAF]) operation, an AAFES section, and a DeCA section.
        These organizations will actively participate in the QRP and are required to
        coordinate their recycling activities with the QRP manager and provide
        recycling/diversion and proceeds information for installation- wide reporting.
     3.6.3.5. QRP Financial Management. Installation QRPs must develop and maintain a
     current business plan that addresses QRP management, facilities, manpower, equipment
     and services, record keeping and auditing, a financial plan and an economic analysis of
     alternatives to include a market analysis.
        3.6.3.5.1. An installation QRP must conduct periodic economic analyses based on
        industry and market research to justify non-mandatory recycling efforts. Guidance for
        completing economic and market analysis/assessment, and documentation of the lack
        of recycling efforts are included in the Air Force QRP Guide.
        3.6.3.5.2. Installations must adequately justify (via documentation, economic and
        market analysis, etc.) any lack of diversion/recycling efforts for mandatory items and
        recommended items in the QRP business plan.
        3.6.3.5.3. MAJCOMs must review installation QRP financial performance, validate
        installation solid waste and QRP data (prior to up-reporting), and monitor installation
        QRP treasury account suspense proceed balances to ensure appropriated funds are
        properly reimbursed.
     3.6.3.6. Contracts that generate waste will include provisions that obligate the contractor
     to participate in the QRP for recyclable wastes generated on the installation, where
     applicable. Contracts covering government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities
     will include provisions that obligate the contractor to participate in the installation QRP
     or if one does not exist, establish their own QRP. To the extent required by law,
     existing contracts covering GOCO facilities must be modified to incorporate these QRP
     provisions.
     3.6.3.7. QRP Funding. The QRP funding process includes obtaining and managing start-
     up costs, recurring operating costs, as well as managing proceeds from recyclable
30                                               AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


     material sales. These activities will be IAW DoDI 7310.1; DoD Financial Management

     10.37); 40 U.S.C. §483 and484; Defense Finance and Accounting Service-Denver
     (DFAS/DE) Accounts Receivable Guide; and DFAS/DE 7010.5-R, Direct, Refund,
     Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level (section C.9.4.9).
        3.6.3.7.1. Funding requirements will be budgeted and programmed through
        installation and MAJCOM financial plans and during the Program Objective
        Memorandum development process.
        3.6.3.7.2. The following recurring operation and management (O&M) recycling
        requirements are facilities operations (FO) (formerly known as Real Property
        Services [RPS]) funded requirements and must be programmed under the FO
        program element code (PEC): on-base landfill operations to meet SW collection and
        disposal requirements; disposal/tipping fees; necessary facilities; manpower
        authorizations; equipment, contracts, and associated costs for day-to-day operation of
        SW, QRP, and recycling programs.
        3.6.3.7.3. The following O&M costs are eligible for environmental funding under the
        pollution prevention PEC as a Level 1 requirement: initial equipment purchase,
        capital costs, and startup costs to meet DoD/AF SW diversion goals for MSW
        recycling, composting programs, and C&D diversion programs; equipment to start up
        MSW recycling and/or recycling programs; establishment of unit and installation
        recycling centers and holding areas; initial costs for source reduction implementation;
        education and outreach; updates to the installation ISWM Plan; and studies,
        assessments, and plans to identify recycling markets and QRP cost-effectiveness (i.e.
        QRP Business Plans).
        3.6.3.7.4. The following O&M costs are eligible for environmental funding under the
        compliance PEC: initial installation and operation and management of leachate and
        gas collection systems and monitoring wells required by law, permit, or regulation;
        waste characterization for solid waste disposal required by law, permit, or regulation.
     3.6.3.8. QRP Proceeds Management. Proceeds generated from the direct sale of non-
     appropriated fund (NAF) owned (Services and AAFES), and DeCA recycling material
     will be returned to the respective organization in accordance with the corresponding
     MOA (or other installation-level agreement) when processed through an installation
     QRP operating with appropriated funds, after O&M costs are offset.
        3.6.3.8.1. IAW 32 CFR Part 172.5(f)(1), an installation involved in the direct sales of
        scrap materials must establish and manage a QRP Budget Clearing (suspense)
        Account suspense for the collection of QRP proceeds up to $2 million with
        appropriate oversight as directed in section 3.3.5.4. Any balance in excess of $2
        million must be transferred to the Treasury.
        3.6.3.8.2. Accounting for recycling proceeds and the distribution thereof shall be

              Proceeds from Department of Defense Sales of Surplus Personal Property, and
              SAF/FMP Accounts Receivable Standard Operating Procedures (July 2008).
              3.6.3.8.3. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2577, Disposal of Recyclable Materials QRP
              proceeds must first be used to cover or reimburse costs attributable to the installation
              recycling program, including, but not limited to manpower, facilities, equipment,
              overhead and other capital investments.
              3.6.3.8.4. If a surplus remains in the account after reimbursing the appropriation, not
              more than 50 percent of that balance may be used at the installation for projects for
              pollution abatement, energy conservation, and occupational safety and health
              activities. A project may not be carried out under the preceding sentence for an
              amount greater than 50 percent of the amount established by law as the maximum
              amount for a minor construction project. The remaining balance available to a
              military installation may be transferred to the non- appropriated morale, welfare and
              recreation (MWR) account of the installation to be used for any MWR activity. Any
              balance in excess of $2 million must be transferred to the Treasury. The
              determination of surplus proceeds shall be made annually at the end of each fiscal
              year.
              3.6.3.8.5. Unused balances of QRP proceeds may not be carried over to the next
              fiscal year. QRP proceeds will be used to reimburse recycling costs in the FY earned.
              3.6.3.8.6. The installation QRP must consistently process and track any outstanding
              recouping actions for un-reimbursed DRMO scrap sales, with the assistance of the
              appropriate CE/A7C resource personnel.
         3.6.3.9. QRP Eligible Items. Categories of recyclable items are explained in Table 3.1.

        3.6.4. Composting. Installations will, as appropriate, operate a composting program or
        participate in a regional composting program. Installations may consider participating in
        existing municipal and community composting programs before implementing an
        installation-operated composting program. Installation programs should include yard
        trimmings, tree trimmings, food wastes, and biosolids.
           3.6.4.1. Installation-operated composting programs will comply with state, local, and
           FGS composting regulations or OEBGD in the absence of approved FGS. As part of the

      ISWM Plan, installations will develop a composting operations plan prior to beginning a
      composting operation. The operations plan should include operating procedures, safety
      and emergency procedures, operational checklists, and process troubleshooting.
      Installations will also maintain facility-monitoring logs to record operational parameters
      such as turning frequency, temperature readings, watering frequency, and windrow/pile
      composition.
      3.6.4.2. Installation-operated composting programs will observe restrictions of
      composting putrescible materials.
          3.6.4.2.1. Off-airport property composting operations should be located no closer
          than the greater of the following distances: 1,200 feet from any air operations area or
          the distance called for by airport design requirements. This spacing should prevent
          material, personnel, or equipment for penetrating any object free area, obstacle free
          zone, threshold siting surface or clearway.
          3.6.4.2.2. Compost operations located in the proximity of the air operations area
          should be monitored to ensure that steam or thermal rise does not adversely affect air
          traffic.
          3.6.4.2.3. Compost operations near airport property should NEVER include food or
          other municipal solid waste.
3.7. Industrial Solid Waste Management Program. *
   3.7.1. Under RCRA, industrial solid wastes are not considered MSW or HW. Industrial solid
   wastes primarily consist of manufacturing process wastes, including wastewater and non-
   wastewater sludges and solids. These include manufacturing wastes from electric power
   generation, fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals; food and related products or by-
   products; stone, glass, clay, and concrete products; and transportation equipment (see 40
   CFR Part 258.2 for the full list of items included as industrial solid wastes). In addition,
   many states and local governments may have a further definition of industrial solid wastes.
   3.7.2. States with an EPA-approved SW management program are responsible for regulating
   the management of industrial solid wastes. These regulations can vary widely from state to
   state and may include standards for design and operation of waste management facilities,
   location monitoring, and recordkeeping.
   3.7.3. Industrial solid wastes will be managed IAW paragraphs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.8 of
   this AFI.
3.8. Construction and Demolition Debris.
   3.8.1. Construction and Demolition Debris General Concepts
      3.8.1.1. C&D debris is generated as a result of construction, renovation, or demolition
      activities. Although C&D debris is usually considered a single waste stream, the
      composition actually varies with each activity and the type, size, and location of the
      structures involved. C&D debris is often contaminated by undesirable components and
      HW or toxic compounds such as asbestos, lead-based paint (LBP), PCB, varnish,
      creosote, pesticides and adhesives.
34                                               AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


     3.8.1.2. Disposing of C&D debris in landfills consumes enormous amounts of space and
     is both economically and environmentally costly. Installations should pursue cost-
     effective management approaches that decrease the landfill space required for C&D
     debris, decrease the amount of HW contaminating C&D debris, and help the Air Force
     further its commitment to pollution prevention.
     3.8.1.3. All aspects of installation C&D debris management will be included in the
     ISWM Plan as required by 3.2.
     3.8.1.4. In accordance with section 3.3.2 of this AFI, data on the weight of C&D debris
     diverted and the weight of C&D debris disposed must be documented and reported. All
     C&D debris disposal contracts must be reviewed to ensure this requirement is being met.
     This information must be reported as requested to AFCEE. C&D debris records must be
     maintained IAW with Section 3.3.1 of this AFI.
  3.8.2. C&D Debris Diversion and Disposal
     3.8.2.1. C&D debris is considered MSW under RCRA and must be characterized IAW
     applicable DoD, federal, state or local characterization requirements discussed in
     paragraph 2.3 to determine whether to dispose of it as non-hazardous SW or HW.
        3.8.2.1.1. C&D debris samples must reflect all components of the C&D debris.
        3.8.2.1.2. Non-hazardous C&D debris may be disposed of in a MSWLF or in a
        landfill that only accepts C&D debris, depending upon local regulations.
        3.8.2.1.3. C&D debris classified as HW must be disposed of in a permitted HW
        facility. C&D debris determined to be hazardous must be separated from non-HW,
        appropriately containerized, labeled and properly manifested prior to transportation
        for final disposal.
     3.8.2.2. Many components of C&D debris can be reused and recycled. However, testing
     or a user’s knowledge letter/document may be necessary to determine whether the C&D
     debris must be managed as HW prior to and during reuse or recycling.
  3.8.3. Asbestos-contaminated C&D Debris Management.
     3.8.3.1. Asbestos is regulated as a hazardous air pollutant under the Clean Air Act;
     regulations are found at 40 CFR Part 61.140–157 (Subpart M - National Emission
     Standard for Asbestos). States often have state-specific asbestos disposal requirements.
     3.8.3.2. In accordance with AFI 32-1052, Facility Asbestos Management, each
     installation must have an Asbestos Management Plan (AMP) and an Asbestos Operating
     Plan (AOP).
     3.8.3.3. The asbestos-contaminated C&D debris generated from construction,
     renovation, or demolition activities must be treated as asbestos-containing waste, labeled
     IAW 29 CFR Part 1926.1101(k), and disposed of IAW 40 CFR Part 61.150 (Standard for
     Waste Disposal for Manufacturing, Fabricating, Demolition, Renovation, and Spraying
     Operations) and any state- specific transportation and disposal requirements.
     3.8.3.4. Maintain waste shipment records for asbestos-containing waste at least two years
     IAW with 40 CFR Part 61.150(d)(1) or longer if required by the AF RDS.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                             35


     3.8.3.4. (USAFA) All construction, renovation, and demolition contracts will contain a
     deliverable requirement to provide the Environmental Section copies of disposal
     manifests for any asbestos containing materials (ACM) generated as a result of the
     contract work.
     3.8.3.5. State and local agencies that require handling and licensing procedures for
     landfills can supply a list of approved or licensed asbestos disposal sites upon request.
     3.8.3.6. CERCLA lists friable asbestos as a hazardous substance with a reportable
     quantity (RQ) of one pound of friable asbestos.  Releases of one pound or more
     friable asbestos must be reported IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management
     (EM) Program Planning and Operations.
     3.8.3.7. OSHA promulgated standards for occupational exposure to asbestos.
     Installations must ensure that personnel involved in asbestos removal and disposal
     operations comply with OSHA standards.
     3.8.3.8. BE will perform health risk assessments of asbestos activities performed by Air
     Force personnel and make recommendations to protect Air Force personnel from
     exposure to asbestos during in-house abatement, removal, or disposal activities.
  3.8.4. Lead Based Paint-contaminated Construction & Demolition Debris Management.
     3.8.4.1. Lead has been utilized as an additive and pigment in paints for many years. Lead
     toxicity is a primary concern, especially for children. Air Force facilities constructed
     before 1978 may have multiple layers of older paint that are potential sources of lead.
     Construction work that involves lead-containing materials must be managed IAW
     applicable federal, state, and local transportation, occupational health treatment, storage,
     and disposal requirements.
     3.8.4.2. LBP that has been removed prior to demolition/construction can be either
     hazardous or non-hazardous waste depending on the method used to remove the LBP. BE
     and CE personnel must review the validity of manufacturer claims that, when used to
     strip or remove the LBP, their product will render the LBP non-hazardous. EPA requires
     the use of the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test to determine if the
     lead in a waste stream is a HW. Lead- containing waste is considered hazardous if the
     concentration of lead analyzed in a TCLP test exceeds 5.0 milligrams lead per liter.
     3.8.4.2. (USAFA) All construction, renovation, and demolition contracts will contain a
     deliverable requirement to provide the Environmental Section copies of Lead Based Paint
     (LBP) laboratory sampling results used for waste determination and copies of the
     disposal manifests for any LBP waste generated as a result of the contract work.
     3.8.4.3. Comply with OSHA occupational exposure control guidelines for lead in the
     construction industry (29 CFR Part 1926.62) for all facility LBP procedures.
     3.8.4.4. CE will coordinate LBP activities, including disposal, with the appropriate state,
     county, and local agencies in advance of actions that may create an LBP hazard.
     3.8.4.5. BE will perform health risk assessments of LBP activities performed by Air
     Force personnel and make recommendations to protect Air Force personnel from
     exposure to lead during in-house abatement, removal, or disposal activities.

Section 3C—Checking and Corrective Action.

3.9. Inspections.
   3.9.1. The installation ISWM program consists of scheduled and unscheduled inspections of
   installation MSW, industrial solid waste, recycling and compost collection, transfer, and
   disposal facilities, and the performance of all possible due diligence to ensure
   local/regional/municipal facilities are compliant.
   3.9.2. Installations must perform internal and external environmental compliance
   assessments according to AFI 32-7045.
   3.9.2. (USAFA) Environmental Compliance Assessments will be performed as part of the
   Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment Management
   Program (ESOHCAMP).
   3.9.3. Installations must inspect trash receptacles used to collect industrial shop waste to
   make sure they do not contain HW.
       3.9.3.1. Squadron facility managers must ensure that hazardous materials, hazardous
       waste and recyclables are not disposed of in trash receptacles and conduct periodic
       squadron spot inspections.
       3.9.3.2. Retain inspection records IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule and
       section 3.3 of this AFI.
       3.9.3.3. Establish an ongoing program to inform all installation personnel of prohibited
       materials in the MSW stream.
3.10. Metrics. Ensure metrics are established consistent with DoD policy to check and report
on the effectiveness of meeting the objectives of the program.

       MANAGEMENT OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL (PCB) WASTES

Section 4A—Planning.

4.1. General Concepts.
   4.1.1. PCB bulk product wastes include but are not limited to non-liquid bulk wastes or
   debris generated from the demolition of buildings and other man-made structures
   manufactured, coated, or serviced with PCBs. PCB bulk product wastes also include PCB-
   containing wastes from the shredding of automobiles, household and industrial appliances, or
   other white goods (e.g. household major appliances); PCB impregnated electrical, sound
   deadening, or other types of insulation and gaskets; or fluorescent light ballasts containing
   PCBs in the potting material.
   4.1.2. The PCB waste management program consists of the proper management of target
   PCB equipment, such as transformers and large capacitors containing greater than 50 parts
   per million (ppm) PCBs.
   4.1.3. The Air Force is committed to eliminating target PCB equipment and reducing future
   liability for cleanup and disposal costs. Such a ―PCB-free‖ designation, however, does not
   absolve an installation from its PCB management burden. For example, a retro-filled
   transformer, once declared PCB-free, may currently contain PCB in concentration above 50
   ppm due to PCB that has leached back into the oil from the surrounding casing/shell of the
   transformer. Non-target PCB equipment, including switches, voltage regulators, and small
   capacitors, also may contain PCBs.
   4.1.4. USAF installations outside the US and US territories should refer to chapter 14 of the
   OEBGD or the country-specific FGS as appropriate, for PCB guidance relevant to those
   installations.

Section 4B—Implementation and Operation.

4.2. Recordkeeping.
   4.2.1. Installations will track PCB disposal with the EPA PCB manifest (EPA Form 8700-
   22, Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest) and report PCB management activities per 40
   CFR Part 61. Forms can be obtained through any source that has been approved by the EPA
   Manifest Registry.
   4.2.1. (USAFA) Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) waste manifests will be maintained as part
   of the HW Disposal Package located in the HW Accumulation Site.
      4.2.1.1. The dates when PCBs or PCB items were removed from service must be
      recorded on the manifest or continuation sheet that accompanies the PCB waste to
      commercial storage and disposal facilities.
      4.2.1.2. Generators and transporters must keep a copy of the manifest for as long as
      required by the Air Force RDS from the date the PCB waste was accepted by the initial
      transporter.
 38                                                AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


      4.2.1.3. The owner or operator of a PCB commercial storage or disposal facility that
      receives off-site shipments of PCB waste must retain a copy of each manifest or shipping
      paper as required by the Air Force RDS.
   4.2.2. Certificates of disposal must be maintained IAW 40 CFR Part 761.180(a), except that
   the retention method and period prescribed in the Air Force RDS apply.
   4.2.2. (USAFA) Certificates of disposal will be maintained as part of the HW Disposal
   Package located in the HW Accumulation Site.
   4.2.3. Annual document logs must be maintained IAW 40 CFR Part 761.180(a), except that
   the retention method and period prescribed in the Air Force RDS apply.
   4.2.3. (USAFA) Annual document logs will be managed and maintained at the HW
   Accumulation Site.
   4.2.4. Exception reports IAW 40 CFR Part 761.215 are required to be submitted when:
      4.2.4.1. A copy of the manifest with the handwritten signature of the owner or operator
      of the designated commercial storage or disposal facility is not received within 45 days of
      the date the waste was accepted by the initial transporter.
      4.2.4.2. The PCB wastes were transferred to a disposer of PCB wastes (for disposal) on a
      date within 9 months from the date of removal from service as indicated on the manifest
      or continuation sheet and the Certificate of Disposal confirming disposal of each PCB
      waste has not been received within 13 months from the date of removal from service.
      4.2.4.3. The PCB wastes were transferred directly (not via a commercial storage facility)
      to a disposer of PCB wastes (for disposal) on a date within 9 months from the date of
      removal from service as indicated on the manifest or continuation sheet and the
      Certificate of Disposal confirms that the disposal of one or more of the PCB wastes was
      on a date more than 1-year after the date of removal from service.
4.3. PCB Waste Disposal.
   4.3.1. Comply with PCB disposal requirements found at 40 CFR Part 761 (Polychlorinated
   Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Processing, Distribution in Commerce and Use
   Prohibitions) and applicable state or applicable local regulation. PCB disposal requirements
   vary depending on whether the items being disposed are PCB liquids, PCB articles, PCB
   remediation waste, PCB bulk product waste, or PCB household waste. DoD 4160.21-M,
   Chapter 10 (Item 26), requires an individual laboratory analysis by gas chromatography
   (GC)/Electron Capture Detector, conducted after an item is taken out of service for disposal
   or prior to turn-in, to indicate the amount of PCB in ppm. Concentration assumptions
   applicable to transformers, electrical equipment, and capacitors are found in 40 CFR Part
   761.2 and can be used in lieu of analysis to determine use. NOTE: Several states regulate
   PCBs and non-liquid PCBs (NLPCBs) as HW.
   4.3.2. PCB liquids (concentrations greater than 500 ppm) are usually found in electric
   transformers and capacitors. These PCB liquids must be disposed in PCB incinerators. PCB-
   contaminated liquids (concentrations between 50 and 500 ppm) must also be disposed in
   PCB incinerators or high efficiency boilers.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                              39


  4.3.3. PCB Large High or Low Voltage Capacitors (concentrations greater than or equal to
  500 ppm) must be disposed in PCB incinerators or approved chemical waste landfills. PCB
  Small Capacitors (contains less than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid) may be disposed in
  MSWLFs in accordance with state regulations, as appropriate.
  4.3.4. Fluorescent light ballasts containing PCBs in their potting material must be
  decontaminated or disposed of in a Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)-approved PCB
  disposal facility, as bulk product waste, or as household waste (where applicable).
  4.3.5. PCB-contaminated electrical equipment (≥50 but <500 ppm) that have been drained of
  PCBs are regulated for disposal under 40 CFR Part 761.60(b)(4). These items must be
  disposed in a MSWLF, a scrap metal recovery oven or smelter, or a TSCA-approved disposal
  facility.
  4.3.6. 40 CFR Part 761.65 (a)(1) limits the storage of any PCB waste to 1-year from the date
  it was determined to be PCB waste and the decision was made to dispose of it. This date is
  the date of removal from service for disposal and the point at which the 1-year time frame for
  disposal begins. The generator of PCB waste is presumed to be in compliance with the 1-year
  limit on storage if the generator can demonstrate that the storage period prior to delivery to a
  disposal facility did not exceed 9 months.
  4.3.7. PCB-Contaminated C&D Debris: Federal disposal requirements apply to C&D debris
  contaminated by 50 ppm or greater NLPCBs when originally removed from service, even if
  current NLPCB concentration is less than 50 ppm. C&D debris that contains less than 50
  ppm NLPCBs before removal from service is not regulated.

                                  MANAGEMENT REVIEW

Section 5A—Planning

5.1. Regulatory Agency Noncompliance Actions. The Installation Environmental function
will review management action plans to ensure that outstanding enforcement actions are resolved
within the required time frames. Review the response to regulatory agency inspection findings
to ensure process owners take timely corrective actions.    In case there is a question of the
validity of the enforcement action or if there is a conflict between the state agency and the
installation, the appropriate REO needs to be consulted for issue clarification and/or liaison with
the state.
5.2. Automated Civil Engineer System-Program Management. Use the Automated Civil
Engineer System-Program Management (ACES-PM) to plan, program, and budget requirements
for waste management compliance and resource management. Environmental managers are
reminded it is the Air Force’s preference to always pursue a feasible pollution prevention
solution first in order to meet a compliance requirement.
5.3. Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Council. ESOHCs are the appropriate
forum for coordinating SW/HW quality reviews and resource management program corrective
actions that require cross-functional review, deliberation, and approval. ESOHCs will conduct
management reviews to ensure waste management goals are met, implementation and operation
procedures are followed, and assessment findings are tracked and completed. The ESOHC also
ensures program goals are appropriate and produce actions to provide necessary mission
capability and capacity.

way, as are large amounts of other hazardous waste.
Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF)—Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF)
[formerly Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF)] was established on 11 Dec 1996 through
the restructuring of the DBOF into individual component working capital funds. AFWCF
activities sell goods and services to a wide range of customers, including DoD operating forces,
Air Force activities, other US government activities and foreign military sales customers. The
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                               49


AFWCF activity groups include Depot Maintenance, Supply Management, and Information
Services.
Biosolids—The soil-like residue of materials removed from sewage during the treatment
process. During treatment, bacteria and other tiny organisms break sewage down into simpler,
harmless organic matter. The organic matter combined with bacterial cell masses, settles out to
form biosolids.
Capacitor—A device for accumulating and holding a charge of electricity and consisting of
conducting surfaces separated by a dielectric. Types of capacitors are as follows:
        (1) Small capacitor means a capacitor which contains less than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of
 dielectric fluid. The following assumptions may be used if the actual weight of the
 dielectric fluid is unknown. A capacitor whose total volume is less than 1,639 cubic
 centimeters (100 cubic inches) may be considered to contain less than 1.36 kgs (3 lbs.) of
 dielectric fluid and a capacitor whose total volume is more than 3,278 cubic centimeters (200
 cubic inches) must be considered to contain more than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid. A
 capacitor whose volume is between 1,639 and 3,278 cubic centimeters may be considered
 to contain less than 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) of dielectric fluid if the total weight of the capacitor is
 less than 4.08 kg (9 lbs.).
      (2) Large high voltage capacitor means a capacitor which contains 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) or
 more of dielectric fluid and which operates at 2,000 volts (a.c. or d.c.) or above.
      (3) Large low voltage capacitor means a capacitor which contains 1.36 kg (3 lbs.) or
 more of dielectric fluid and which operates below 2,000 volts (a.c. or d.c.).

are available, without further Congressional appropriation, to meet the needs of users. 10 U.S.C.
§ 2208
Initial Accumulation Point—A collection point located at, or near, the point of waste
generation where wastes are initially accumulated. The area must be under the control of the
operator of the process generating the waste. The operator should be near the area often enough
to detect a leak within a reasonable time frame. A maximum of 55 gallons of HW or one quart of
acute HW may be accumulated at an initial accumulation point. If more than this amount is
accumulated, the excess must be moved to a HWAS within three days of exceeding the limit.
Unless the quantity limit is exceeded, or state regulations require a limit on storage time (i.e.,
California), there are no storage time limits that apply to initial accumulation points. Initial
accumulation points are also known as satellite accumulation points (SAP).

CFR 273.
Yard Trimmings—Grass clippings, leaves, brush, weeds, Christmas trees, and hedge and tree
prunings from residences and businesses. Yard trimmings may also include stumps and brush,
but these materials are not normally handled at composting facilities.

                                         Attachment 2
      WASTE MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS

A2.1. RCRA, 42 U.S.C., 6901, et seq., as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments, sets minimum standards for managing SW and HW at those DoD Installations
within the US and US territories subject to the jurisdiction of US federal law. The RCRA
regulations governing SW and HW management generally are found at Title 40 CFR Subchapter
I (Part239, Part 240, Part 243, Part 246, Part 247, Part 254-258, Part 260-268, Part 270-273, and
Part 279).
A2.2. The Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U. S.C. 651, et seq., , sets federal health
and safety standards for employees who work with hazardous substances, training requirements
for hazardous waste clean-up operations at RCRA facilities, and emergency response operations,
which is also known as HAZWOPER training.          The OSHA regulations in 29 CFR Part
1910.1200 describe employer hazard communication requirements, commonly referred to as
HAZCOM. HAZCOM requirements for installations within and outside the US and US
territories are set forth in US DoDI 6050.5, DoD Hazard Communication Program.
A2.3. The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49 U. S.C. 1801-1819,
requires the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate standards for the interstate and intrastate
commercial transportation of hazardous materials. These standards are found at 49 CFR Part
171-180 and also apply to hazardous waste transportation. For overseas installations, there are
strict controls on the transnational shipment of hazardous materials and hazardous waste. Failure
to properly package and document items may result in violations of local and international law.
Contact the DRMO and your MAJCOM JA for guidance about international shipping
requirements.
A2.4. TSCA, 15 U. S.C. 2601, et seq., regulates the management and disposal of various
chemical substances and mixtures including LBP, PCBs, and asbestos. TSCA regulations are
found at 40 CFR Part 700-799, with the regulations governing the management of LBP, PCBs,
and asbestos found at Parts 745, 761, and 763 respectfully.
A2.5. CERCLA, 42 U. S.C. 9601, et seq., and the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act (SARA) authorized funds to clean up contaminated sites and provides that
the responsible parties reimburse the government for cleanup costs. CERCLA regulations are
found at 40 CFR Part 300-374. At the time that SARA was passed, Congress enacted the
Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) statute, 10 USC 2701, et seq. That statute
created the Defense Environmental Restoration Account (the ―DERA account‖), which is used to
pay for DoD cleanups. Recently, each DoD agency was given its own restoration account, so that
the Air Force restoration account is known as the Air Force Environmental Restoration Account
or AF ERA.
A2.6. The Federal Facility Compliance Act, Public Law 102-386, which amended RCRA
Section 42 U.S.C. 6961, generally waives the federal government’s sovereign immunity under
RCRA and allows state and federal regulatory agencies to fine federal facilities for violating
applicable federal, state, and local SW and HW laws.
A2.7. The following laws and regulations also impact SW and HW management: 10
U.S.C. 2577, Disposal of Recyclable Materials; 10 U.S.C. 2692, Storage, Treatment, And
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                            55


Disposal Of Nondefense Toxic And Hazardous Materials; 32 CFR Part 172, Disposition of
Proceeds from DoD Sales of Surplus Personal Property; and 41 CFR Part 101-45, Sale,
Abandonment or Destruction of Personal Property and 101-46, Replacement of Personal
Property Pursuant to the Exchange/Sale Authority.
A2.8. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorized states may adopt or enact
regulations as long as those regulations are at least as stringent as federal SW and HW
regulations. Most states have SW and HW regulations that are more stringent than federal
regulations. Air Force installations must follow authorized state or local SW and HW regulations
that are more stringent (but not broader in scope) than the federal regulations.

                         AIR FORCE HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL

Table A3.1. Air Force Hazardous Waste Disposal Contract Checklist.


      Air Force Hazardous Waste (HW) Disposal Contract
      Checklist (as of Jun 07)

      This checklist is intended to highlight issues one should consider when making decisions about contracting for
      hazardous waste disposal. Slightly updated from 1999 version. This checklist is NOT all-inclusive, and is not a
      substitute for the laws and regulations applicable to hazardous waste management. Refer to 40 CFR 260-279, 49
      CFR 171-180, AFI 32-7042 Waste Management, AFPAM 32-7043 Hazardous Waste Management Guide, and
      applicable state and local regulations for detailed requirements. The AFMC Guide for Contracting for Hazardous
      Waste Disposal was also referenced to develop this checklist, and contains additional guidance. This checklist
      assists installations/MAJCOMs in making decisions to contract for HW disposal separate from the DoD-designated
      Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS). DRMS is the HW contracting agent for the Defense
      Logistics Agency (DLA) and oversees local/regional Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMO).




             Decision to Contract for Hazardous Waste
             Disposal vs. DRMS

      1.     AFI 32-7042 and AFPAM 32-7043 direct that bases use existing
             Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) contracts
             for hazardous waste (HW) disposal, unless the installation
             commander decides it is in the best interest of the AF to do
             otherwise and the MAJCOM agrees.

             Furthermore, DoD 4160.21 M, Chapter 10, Paragraph 4A states
             “A decision not to use the DLA/DRMS for HW disposal may be
             made IAW DODD 4001.1 for best accomplishment of the
             installation mission, and shall be concurred with by the
             component chain of command to ensure that installation
             contracts and disposal criteria are at least as stringent as criteria
             used by DRMS.”
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                      57


     2.   If a problem exists with the DRMS contract or DRMO oversight
          which precludes their use, then clearly identify the problem the
          installation is having with DRMO/DRMS and document the
          answer provided when confronted with the problem.



     3.   Examine current DRMS contracts to determine whether an
          independent local contract for disposal may create a breach of an
          existing DRMS contract.



     4.   Identify what resources and other contract management costs
          will be involved in preparing and managing a local contract (pre-
          award evaluation, site inspections, solicitation development, post-
          award monitoring, etc.). Also include the estimated cost for
          personnel to perform audits as mentioned in checklist item #15
          (audit cost should include personnel training).


     5.   If the installation commander has compelling justification to contract for
          HW disposal rather than use DRMS (e.g., significant cost savings,
          DRMS support problems), then submit a request for waiver, with
          justification, to the MAJCOM. Serious good-faith efforts should always
          be made to resolve any difficulties with DRMS before deciding to use a
          local contract. Considerable resources are required to put together a
          local contract, and to administer and monitor the contract.




          Requirements documents such as Performance
          Work Statements/Environmental Requirements

     6.   Refer to AFI 63-124, Performance-Based Services Acquisition,
          for guidance on writing a statement of work and a quality
          assurance surveillance plan, except for ANG which must consult
          with their contracting function for best approach.



     7.   Review DRMS solicitation provisions.

     8.   Requirements documents such as Performance Work
          Statements for transportation, treatment, and disposal must meet
          or exceed federal, state, and local legal requirements. Refer to
          40 CFR 260-279 and 49 CFR 171-180 for federal requirements.
          Also refer to AFI 32-7042 and AFPAM 32-7043 for Air Force
          instructions and guidance.



     9.   Staff Judge Advocate and the base environmental manager must
          review and approve performance work statement and quality
          assurance plan before submitting to the Contracting Officer.



     10. Identify what permits (EPA, state, other) are required for the
         various transporters, treatment, or disposal facilities to be used
         by the contractor.



     11. Contracts for HW disposal must require the contractor to ensure
         its employees receive appropriate training as federal, state, and
         local law requires.



     12. Include required FAR and FAR supplement clauses (hazardous
         waste liability, subcontracting limitations, prohibition on storage
         and disposal of toxic material, etc). Note that, in general, the FAR
         has not kept up with rapidly changing environmental
         requirements, and it may be necessary to rely upon locally
         developed or modified clauses, or upon those developed by
         DRMS. Clauses covering financial responsibility issues as they
         relate to specific environmental liabilities are not found in the
         FAR or FAR supplements. New clauses may have to be created
         which ensure that the contractor, at a minimum, meets the
         financial responsibility requirements of 40 CFR 264 Subpart H.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                   59


     13. Require offerors to indicate which transporters and TSD facilities
         will be used for each of the types of wastes involved, and to
         submit EPA ID numbers and copies of all required permits held
         by the transporters and TSD facilities to be used.



     14. Contract should state that no change of transporters or
         Treatment, Storage or Disposal (TSD) facilities will be made
         without the prior written concurrence of the Contracting Officer,
         and require that copies of permits be submitted for any proposed
         transporters or TSD facilities for evaluation.



     15.   Specify in the Requirements documents such as Performance Work
           Statements that the TSD facilities will be inspected periodically by
           appropriate base personnel, if appropriate, to ensure wastes are being
           handled and disposed of properly. Installation and MAJCOM must
           consult to determine when inspections are appropriate.


     16. Include pre- and post-award on-site facility reviews and/or
         inspections in the quality assurance surveillance plans.
         Inspections should be considered if TSDF information reviewed
         is not dependable or unreliable to verify compliance.



     17. Require contractor to provide for alternative treatment or disposal
         facilities to cover unanticipated events which could preclude
         treatment or disposal, such as, the proposed facility refusing to
         accept the waste, going out of business, or otherwise becoming
         incapable or unsuitable to handle the wastes properly.



     18. Require that all hazardous waste be weighed in the presence of
         a DOD employee or DOD appointed official prior to transporting
         the waste.
60                                           AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


     19. Contracting and environmental personnel should consult with the
         Staff Judge Advocate’s office to determine if there is a legal
         requirement for the contractor to maintain insurance which will
         cover liabilities associated with improper transportation,
         treatment, or disposal of hazardous wastes. Staff Judge
         Advocate’s office should also determine if an indemnification
         clause should be included in the contract.



     20. Identify and bill all reimbursable customers. Industrial and
         revolving fund organizations, NAF, and certain tenants are
         required to reimburse the installation for HW disposal services.
         Identify reimbursable requirements in host-tenant agreements.




          Pre-Award Evaluation of Offerors

     21. Contact regulatory agencies to determine the present permit
         status of each facility. Document the facility’s RCRA permit
         status. Check with EPA Regional Offices and appropriate state
         regulatory agencies to obtain a list of licensed (permitted)
         contractors. Check with EPA Regional Offices to determine
         which contractors have been placed on EPA’s List of Facilities
         Prohibited from Receiving Government Contracts. Also, check
         with base contracting office for list of contractors suspended or
         debarred from contracting with the DoD. Transporters should be
         evaluated in the same fashion.



     22. Determine facility’s environmental enforcement record.
         (Transporters should be evaluated in the same fashion as TSD
         facilities.)
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                                61


              a. In the last 5 years, how many NOVs (Notice of Violation)
              or other enforcement actions have been taken against the
              disposal facility? What were they for? What regulatory
              agencies issued the enforcement actions? Have the
              deficiencies been corrected? If not, why not, and when will
              they be corrected?



              b. Have any lawsuits been filed against the facility in the last
              5 years? If so, what for, and what were the outcomes?



     23. Develop discriminating evaluation criteria to review contractors’
         technical proposals.



     24. Air Force personnel with expertise in hazardous waste disposal
         should visit the TSD facilities to be used by the contractor to
         inspect the facilities to ensure the accuracy of the data contained
         in the contractor’s technical proposal. MAJCOM/Installations
         should consult on physical inspections and undertake them if
         data/information received is not dependable or unreliable.



     25. Determine overall status/strength of the contractor’s business.
         Examine financial statements, insurance, and business volume.



          Post-Award Monitoring

     26. Installation commanders should designate, in writing, manifest-
         certifying officials.
62                                             AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012


     27. HW manifest certifying officials must ensure all waste is weighed
         in the presence of an authorized DOD official/representative prior
         to shipment off base, verify that proper items are loaded for
         shipment, and observe the contractor remove the hazardous
         waste.



     28. Base environmental personnel should review the HW manifest
         after it is returned to the base (generator). Verify that the wastes
         turned over to the transporter are the same wastes ultimately
         disposed of in the facility with which the base contracted for
         treatment or disposal (verify the wastes were properly treated or
         disposed of and not stored, resold, improperly mixed with other
         wastes, etc.).


     29. Monitor the contractor’s records, manifests, etc., to ensure they
         are consistent with the records maintained by the base.



     30. Comply with manifest requirements, recordkeeping, and reporting
         requirements, as specified in 40 CFR 262. Specifically, maintain
         a manifest archive so a comprehensive record of manifests is
         available. Maintain in the event there is a PRP (CERCLA
         Potentially Responsible Party) notice relating to a Third Party Site
         identified at some future time on the basis of an allegation that
         wastes from this contract contributed to that site.



     31. Perform on-site facility inspections as needed to verify
         information received on TSD facilities.
AFI32-7042_USAFASUP_I 23 MAY 2012                                            63


     32. Update records at least annually by contacting regulatory
         agencies to determine the present permit status of each facility.
         Document the facility’s RCRA permit status and any enforcement
         actions. Check with EPA Regional Offices and appropriate state
         regulatory agencies to obtain a list of licensed (permitted)
         contractors. Check with EPA Regional Offices to determine
         which contractors have been placed on EPA’s List of Facilities
         Prohibited from Receiving Government Contracts. Also, check
         with base contracting office for list of contractors suspended or
         debarred from contracting with the DoD. Update records for
         transporters in the same fashion as for TSD facilities.
