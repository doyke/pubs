       2.1.1. The 916th Air Refueling Wing Publications Management Office, assigned under
       the 916th Force Support Squadron, will be the focal point for the Wing OPR. The office

           2.1.1.1. The 916 FSS/SCOK will be responsible for maintaining a shared folder that
           will contain an inclusive list of official, current, and mandatory items. This folder
           will be accessible via the shared drive (S:\Public Information\Wing Bulletin Boards).
       2.1.2. The 916 FSS/SCOK will maintain a list of appointed Bulletin Board Monitors and
       verify its currency quarterly.
       2.1.3. The 916 FSS/SCOK will conduct inspections of bulletin boards on a random basis
       using the Bulletin Board Compliance Checklist found in Attachment 2.

           individuals that have posted unauthorized material of the removal. The Bulletin

           from the official bulletin board if no “Unofficial” bulletin board has been established
           (see chapter 3). However, this will be the prerogative of the Bulletin Board Monitor.

       entranceways to buildings or in strategic areas with high traffic volume. To meet this
       objective, Official Bulletin Boards as defined in this instruction will not be located in
       Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF).
           2.3.1.1. Commanders and/or Section Chiefs will use their own discretion in
           providing bulletin boards that present a neat and standardized appearance.
