SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This instruction updates and clarifies previous guidance regarding the Secretary of the Air Force's Person-
nel Council and the Air Force Personnel Board. It deletes two boards that no longer exist, the Board of
Review and the Physical Disability Appeal Board. It incorporates the Air Force reorganization that elim-
inated the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations, and Environ-
ment) and established the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower and Reserve Affairs). It deletes
references to Air Force Regulations. It updates references to actions taken under the authority of the
Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act. It implements new procedures for carrying out certain deci-
sions of the Air Force Clemency and Parole Board.


1. The Air Force Personnel Council :
   1.1. Definition. The Personnel Council (Council) is a quasi-judicial organization under the Assistant
   Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. It acts for and makes recommendations
   to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee on military personnel matters and announces Secretarial
   decisions.
2                                                                        AFI36-2023 8 MARCH 2007


    1.2. Composition. The Council is composed of regular, United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR),
    and Air National Guard (ANG) commissioned officers, noncommissioned officers, and Department of
    the Air Force civilians. The Director, Air Force Review Boards Agency (AFRBA), SAF/MRB,
    appoints component board members on special orders. Additionally, with concurrence of their com-
    manders, collateral board members may serve on component boards at the request of the Director,
    Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (SAFPC), SAF/MRBP. The names and organizations of
    these collateral officers will also be reflected in special orders.
    1.3. The directives and statutes listed below define component boards of the Council and describe the
    responsibilities of the Director, SAFPC, and each component board member for each respective
    board.

and appoints members of the Council as the recorder and/or legal advisor.
    1.4. Authority. The Director, AFRBA, and the Director, SAFPC, can each act on certain recommen-
    dations of the Air Force Personnel Board (AFPB). The authority of the board is set forth in the gov-
    erning statutes and instructions (regulations) applicable to the underlying personnel action or as
    provided for in Secretarial delegations and policy memoranda. A copy of the current delegation order
    may be found at http://www.safaa.hq.af.mil/aax/safo/240-8.pdf. A complete list of pertinent statutes
    and instructions can be found in the attachment to this AFI.
    1.5. The Air Force Personnel Board. The AFPB reviews and acts on personnel matters, including
    those listed in paragraph 2. All commissioned officers on the Council are members of this Board. Not-
    withstanding any other provision in any other Air Force Instruction, a civilian member of the Depart-
    ment of the Air Force assigned to the Council may also sit on the Personnel Board; additional
    members may be appointed by the Director, AFRBA, on special orders. Three members constitute a
    quorum, with the following exceptions:

       bers.
       1.5.2. For physical disability evaluations or regular Air Force appointments of medical corps
