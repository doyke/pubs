SUMMARY OF CHANGES

New document replaces in total previous Arnold Engineering Development Complex Instruction
(AEDCI) 21-300, Supplied Utility Management, and supplements Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 32-1061, Providing Utilities to U.S. Air Force Installations. This instruction applies to all
Government personnel planning, performing, or providing direction towards the delivery of
supplied utilities; electrical power, natural gas, and potable (drinking) water to Arnold
 2                                                                AEDCI32-1061 26 JUNE 2014


Engineering Development Complex (AEDC). It documents the roles and responsibilities of the
AEDC Test Support Division (TSD) Civil Engineer Branch (TSDC), as well as other personnel
and organizations that play a significant role in the process for utility delivery in support of the
AEDC mission. While references to the AEDC Operating Contractor and utility suppliers are
made herein, this document does not direct the performance of their work.

                              VERIFYING UTILITY INVOICES

A2.1. The Energy Manager (AEDC/TSDCN) is: Responsible for verifying all utility invoices
in which a utility provider is billing AEDC. The TVA.E.Main Base bill and the
ERPUD.NG.Main Base bill make up more than 95% of AEDC total purchased utilities and are
currently the only 2 bills that are verified monthly. A spreadsheet titled ValPow FYXX is used to
complete this verification. This spreadsheet is restricted and access must be granted prior to use.
The first tab of the spreadsheet contains detailed instructions, providing a list of all files needed
and describing the process used to complete this task. The Utilities Manager for AEDC’s
Operating Contractor is also tasked with verifying AEDC utility invoices. This double-checking
procedure assures that AEDC is billed correctly. The location for the ValPow FYXX spreadsheet
can be found below.

            UTILITY CONSUMPTION CALCULATIONS AND REPORTING

A3.1. The Energy Manager (AEDC/TSDCN): Calculates base-wide utility consumption and
reports results monthly to AFMC using the AFERS. Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 11-6,
Utilities Reporting for Air Force Facilities, gives instruction on collecting and tracking utility
data and using AFERS. The Energy Manager collects all utility bills and reports for on-base
potable water production, fuel oil and propane gas purchasing, and steam and electric meter
consumption. The Energy Manager uses a spreadsheet titled 20XX ARNOLD ENERGY
REPORTING to calculate utility consumption. This spreadsheet is restricted and access must be
granted prior to use. The first tab of the spreadsheet contains detailed instructions, providing a
list of all files needed and describing the process used to complete this task. A second
spreadsheet titled FYXX-UTL-WB-AR-Month is used to double check calculations and insures
accuracy in calculating and reporting energy consumption. This secondary spreadsheet is
emailed to AFMC each month. Locations for both spreadsheets can be found at 20XX ARNOLD
ENERGY REPORTING- \\Aedc15b1103\energy\data\DUERS. FYXX-UTL-WB-AR-Month-

A4.1. The Energy Manager (AEDC/TSDCN): Calculates base-wide utility consumption and
reports progress toward Arnold, AFMC, and AF metrics and goals. The Energy Manager tracks
metrics and goals using a spreadsheet titled 20XX ARNOLD ENERGY REPORTING. This
spreadsheet is restricted and access must be granted prior to use. The first tab of the spreadsheet
contains detailed instructions, providing a list of all files needed and describing the process used
to complete this task. Location of the spreadsheet can be found below: 20XX ARNOLD

      DETERMINING RATES/CHARGES FOR REIMBURSABLE CUSTOMERS

A5.1. AEDC/FMP performs: A cost analysis to determine all utility rates for all reimbursable
customers. AFI 32-1061 refers to documents AF 3553, AF 3554, AF 3555, and AF 3556 which
make up different sections of a Utility Sales Agreement. These documents calculate utility rates
for reimbursable customers for all utilities except electricity. Due to the level of complexity
found in determining the electricity rate, AEDC’s Operating Contractor has developed a similar
spreadsheet to determine the electricity utility rate. The Operating Contractor performs initial
calculations for all utility rates and the Cost Analysis Group verifies all calculations and
establishes a rate schedule for all reimbursable customers. Forms AF 3553, AF 3554, AF 3555,
and AF 3556 can be found at http://www.usa-federal-forms.com/usaf.html. AEDC/FMP is
also supported by AEDC’s Operating Contractor when determining monthly consumption
charges. When meters are unavailable, yearly calculations are performed to establish estimates
for individual customers. When meters are available, both AF and Contractor authorize meter
readings to insure accurate charges to customers. Previous months/years values are used to
estimate and/or validate consumption values.
