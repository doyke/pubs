Air Force Instruction 90-821, 30 March 2005, is supplemented as follows: This supplement sets out
policies and procedures relating to the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) program to all units assigned
to the 48th Fighter Wing, 100th Air Refueling Wing and tenant units at RAF Lakenheath and RAF
Mildenhall. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
prescribed by AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program; route AF Form 847s from the field
through MAJCOM publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This Lakenheath Supplement identifies the requirements of the specific workcenter Hazard
Communication (HAZCOM) program, Bioenvironmental Engineering’s (BE) responsibilities, the
HAZCOM program manager’s responsibilities, and supervisor’s responsibilities in communicating and
minimizing hazards.

1.8.2.11. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Coordinate with BE on health risk mitigation when required
controls (i.e. ventilation systems, PPE, training, etc.) are identified as not meeting criteria by any
assessment agency.
 2                                       AFI90-821_LAKENHEATHSUP 25 FEBRUARY 2013



1.8.2.12. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) For work areas where toxic materials are used, the shop supervisor
will ensure routine cleaning effectively maintains work surfaces “as free as practicable” of toxic materials
and minimizes spreading of contamination.
2.3.7. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Each shop/work area that requires a Hazard Communications Program
will maintain a binder organized in the following manner:
2.3.7.1. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Tab A: An appointment letter naming the shop supervisor
responsible for hazard communication and at least one designated program alternate.
2.3.7.2. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Tab B: This AFI 90-821 Lakenheath Supplement.
2.3.7.3. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Tab C: The approved shop specific training (approved template
available from 48 AMDS/SGPB), and any chemical specific training required by Occupational Safety &
Administration (OSHA) expanded standards (e.g. asbestos, hexavalent chromium, lead, cadmium,
methylene chloride, etc.). Consult with Public Health for training information (226-8777). Once all
shop-specific information has been added to the approved training template, a hard-copy version will
serve as the shop-specific written program.
2.3.7.4. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Tab D: The current workplace hazardous chemical inventory with a
reference to location of Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and their corresponding AF Form 3952, Chemical
Hazardous Material Request Authorization Form, prescribed by AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials
Management. This is completed through the Enterprise Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health –
Management Information System (EESOH-MIS).
2.3.7.5. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Tab E: A list of all non-routine tasks involving hazardous materials,
or documentation stating no non-routine tasks are performed.
2.3.7.6. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Tab F: BE routine assessment survey and special surveys.
2.7. 1.1. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) Completing the required shop specific training template with
accurate information is an approved training program and does not require further written approval from
base agencies. Supervisors electing to use other HAZCOM training material are required to get approval
from BE, PH, base safety office, and fire department.
2.7.2.1.9. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) The shop-level HAZCOM training plan must include OSHA’s
Expanded Standard (ES) training where BE has identified potential exposures to ES chemicals. ES
chemicals include hexavalent chromium, asbestos, lead, methylene chloride, cadmium, and others as
defined by OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Z and identified by BE. Assistance on ES training information
can be provided by 48 AMDS/SGPM.
2.8.1.1. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) The hazardous chemical inventory needs to be inclusive of all
chemicals used in a specific work area by process as outlined in EESOH-MIS.
2.8.1.2. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) SDS managers can number their SDSs with an internal system
appropriate for their shop as long as the numbers are accurately cross-referenced to the chemical
inventory.
2.8.3. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) To the extent possible, hazardous materials must be obtained from the
Base Supply Hazmart Pharmacy. When hazardous materials are obtained through local purchases or
other avenues, shop supervisors must ensure they have a valid AF Form 3952 and the SDS (or UK/EU
equivalent information) for that chemical prior to its use by shop personnel.
2.10.1. (Added)(LAKENHEATH) For contract projects: at the pre-performance conference, and
subsequently during the contract performance period, the requiring activity quality assurance evaluator
will advise work area supervisors and AF employees monitoring the performance of contractors of
AFI90-821_LAKENHEATHSUP 25 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   3



hazardous chemicals introduced by the contractor. The contractor is required to submit information on the
use of hazardous materials according to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.223-3,
Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data. Additionally, Air Force Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) Clause 5352.223-9003, Enhanced Security of Products,
requires that all contractors obtain prior approval for any hazardous materials that will be brought onto the
installation and used during the course of the contract. The quality assurance evaluator will assist
contractors in completing the necessary forms for submittal to the HAZMART Pharmacy.
