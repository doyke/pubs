2. ELECTRONIC WARFARE (EW) TRAINING:

  2.1. General. This chapter delineates EW training requirements for all AFGSC units.

  2.2. EW Operational Training Concept. The primary goal for EW operational training is to
  TRAIN LIKE WE INTEND TO FIGHT by maintaining a high state of readiness through active
  and integrated EW training programs. This applies to all aircrews and logistics support personnel
  assigned to AFGSC and the AFRC units. Airpower will be tasked into threat environments
  ranging from permissive to intensely hostile. Our EW capabilities must be available to provide
  self-protection survivability of personnel and aircraft systems and we must also be able to operate
  in the face of an adversary who is employing EW (EP and/or EA) against our forces.

     2.2.1. "TRAIN LIKE WE FIGHT" by striving to use all forms of EW systems (i.e. chaff,
     flares, RWRs, etc.) thus performing EW activity on every combat training sortie, to the
     maximum extent possible when conditions and training allows.

     2.2.2. Where shortfalls exist (i.e., training requirements, ranges, EW equipment, EW
     software/Mission Data (MD), etc.) which do not allow the performance of EW training
     activity, identify these shortfalls to AFGSC/A3T for resolution.
10                                                          AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010

        2.2.3. Initial and continuation EW training will be incorporated into peacetime training
        programs and exercises at all levels of command to ensure the maximum degree of readiness.

        2.2.4. The unit commander is responsible for the unit's EW training program, to include
        academic instruction, controlled hands-on environment training (e.g., simulators, part-task
        trainers, training aids, etc.), deployment preparation training, and flying training.

        2.2.5. Specialized EW courses should be used to ensure the standardization of EW instruction
        at the wing, group and unit levels.

     2.3. Aircrew EW Training:

        2.3.1. All aircrews will be trained in enemy threat environment capabilities and maintain
        proficiency in the operation of EW equipment tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
        Training will consist of a mix of ground, simulator, and flying training (focused on the unit’s
        mission and wartime OPLAN taskings).

        2.3.2. EW training programs must be conducted on a regular basis. Training requirements
        will be as directed in aircraft specific 11-series publications and Ready Aircrew Program
        (RAP) tasking.

        2.3.3. EW Instructors. The Wing or Group/Squadron EWO is responsible for ensuring EW
        academics are taught by only the most highly qualified instructors in that EW area of
        expertise. EWOs/CSOs identified as academic instructors will be upgraded according to the
        appropriate procedures in the aircraft-specific AFI 11-2MDS volume set and applicable MDS
        syllabi. Personnel other than EWOs identified as unit EW academic instructors should be fully
        qualified IAW this instruction.

     2.4. Commander EW Training:

        2.4.1. Commanders should to the maximum extent possible attend the CAF WEPTAC
        Conference. The CAF WEPTAC is administered by the 53d EWG, 68th EWS.

3. PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING EA TRAINING:

     3.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for accomplishing EA activity against

          3.3.3.1.1. Normal search to item-of-interest to lock-on.

          3.3.3.1.2. Normal search to lock-on.

          3.3.3.1.3. Item-of-interest to lock-on.
12                                                          AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010

               3.3.3.1.4. Lock-on only.

               3.3.3.1.5. Frequency changes between lock-on.

               3.3.3.2. SAM Threats. The ESS has the following options for SAM simulation:

               3.3.3.2.1. Operating in low PRF, high PRF, or low and high PRF switching.

               3.3.3.2.2. Frequency separation between beams other than normal.

               3.3.3.2.3. Changing frequencies within the band.

               3.3.3.2.4. Changing modes of operation (e.g., Track-While-Scan (TWS) to Dish-to-
               Dish (DTD) to Lobe-on-Receive-Only (LORO)).

               3.3.3.2.5. EA reactive SAM simulation based on aircraft EA (MUTES/TRAINS, JTE,
               and UMTE).

           3.3.3.3. Fighter Threats. The ESS has the following options for AI simulation:

               3.3.3.3.1. Normal search to lock-on.

               3.3.3.3.2. Lock-on only.

               3.3.3.3.3. PRF switching.

               3.3.3.3.4. Frequency shifting.

               3.3.3.3.5. Power changes to simulate AI closure.

        3.3.4. Simulated Equipment Malfunction Runs (SEMR). Wings are encouraged to conduct
        EA activity with simulated electronic warfare (EW) system malfunctions. SEMRs will not be
        scheduled on higher headquarters directed (HHD) missions or accomplished on inflight
        evaluations - scheduled or no-notice. The ESS must be advised of SEMR no later than the IP
        call if not previously pre-coordinated.

     3.4. General Procedures:

        3.4.1. Command procedures described in applicable volumes of AFTTP 3-1, EA Mission
        Guides, and EA system handbooks provide aircrews with the best possible information
        available for countering threats. These procedures and tactics must be continually emphasized
        and used within peacetime constraints. The use of unproven or unauthorized guidance
        jeopardizes training effectiveness and negatively reinforces the application of these guidelines
        in a combat environment.

        3.4.2. Aircrews should attempt EA runs concurrent with bomb runs when possible.
AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010                                                                    13

     3.4.2.1. EA scenario descriptions can be found at the following web site:
     https://wwwmil.nellis.af.mil/units/range/default.htm click on EW scenarios hyperlink.

     3.4.2.2. When EA runs are performed in formation, all aircraft will be subject to threats.
     Aircraft will counter all non-restricted threats provided by the site. All aircraft may take
     credit for the run providing each aircraft detects and counters (as appropriate) the signal
     environment.

     3.4.2.3. Non-concurrent high altitude EA runs must start from an IP of not less than 50
     NM from the ESS and should continue to within 5 NM for fidelity but no closer than 3
     NM of the site due to site aircraft tracking limitations.

  3.4.3. Crews will plan each training run as if they are conducting the attack in a combat
  situation. Transmitters will be preset, search procedures in place, EW transmitter allocation
  applied, crew coordination conducted, and Fence Checks complete along with employing
  tactics that must simulate combat conditions. Aircrews will preset equipment and react to
  simulated threat signals according to applicable volumes of AFTTP 3-1, appropriate technical
  orders, applicable EA Mission Guides, and/or EA system handbooks, and local directives.

  3.4.4. EA run vulnerability will be from initial engagement until site and/or aircraft
  termination and will be based on current frequency clearance restrictions.

     3.4.4.1. Aircrews will provide the site with sufficient notice and information to ensure the
     proper feedback of EA activity.

     3.4.4.2. EA requests should be passed to the site via electronic means during mission
     planning.

     3.4.4.3. Attempt to contact the site and confirm requested activity prior to the IP.

     3.4.4.4. For CORI/NORIs, specific EA activity will not be requested.

  3.4.5. If EA is not requested in advance, the site may determine the band and type of activity
  to be conducted, depending on the equipment available, and according to the following
  instructions:

     3.4.5.1. MUTES capable sites will provide a scenario other than maximum proficiency
     and practice CORI/NORI scenarios. The scenario will start once the MUTES acquire the
     aircraft. If the site controls Mini-MUTES pedestals, its personnel will select Mini-MUTES
     scenarios compatible with the MUTES scenario selected.

     3.4.5.2. Sites equipped with Mini-MUTES only will select any scenario other than a
     maximum proficiency scenario. The selection will be based on the operational capability
     of the site.

  3.4.6. Aircrews will counter appropriate EW, GCI, and acquisition signals (if capable) in
  conjunction with the threats. Active countermeasures will be initiated against signals per the
14                                                          AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010

        EA system handbook, applicable volumes of AFTTP 3-1 volume set, and airborne EA
        frequency authorizations. Terminate any acquisition jamming interference which causes
        ineffective communications.

        3.4.7. When the aircrew establishes radio contact, they will confirm the activity previously
        scheduled via electronic means.

           3.4.7.1. (B-52 only) Confirm all EWO scheduled or no-notice inflight evaluations,
           including any EWO NAF evaluation, by calling in "for checkride credit" with normal site
           call-in.

           3.4.7.2. Feedback recording begins when both the following conditions exist: any threat
           radar in the scenario first becomes a threat to the aircraft, and the aircraft is within the
           site's frequency clearance range.

               3.4.7.2.1. Termination will be before the IP of the next inbound EA run. Aircrews
               should be aware EA runs may be compressed or terminated early to allow site to set up
               for subsequent runs.

               3.4.7.2.2. Aircrew will not radiate until within the frequency-cleared area around the
               site. Refer to each site's specific frequency clearance. EXCEPTION: Radiation outside
               site-specific cleared area is authorized provided cleared frequencies exist. Refer to
               ACC/A3I guidance as well as local publications or guidance for current clearances.

           3.4.7.3. MUTES/TRAINS-equipped sites will not engage the aircraft until an EA request
           is received from the aircrew. The site will make every effort to provide feedback for the
           EA run, but if the EA request is received too late for TRAINS set up, feedback will be
           limited.

        3.4.8. During EA runs, IFF/SIF modes and codes must be used in accordance with ATC
        instructions or as directed by the site or communications plan. Specific EA requests and
        coordinated Mode 3 codes, made in advance, are especially important at Mini-MUTES
        equipped sites, since Mini-MUTES pedestals can engage the aircraft long before the IP or
        UHF radio range. The site needs valid Mode 3 to provide feedback to the aircrews. Other
        aircraft in the formation may squawk Mode 3 STBY if authorized by ARTCC.

        3.4.9. Immediate feedback may be requested by asking for the presence/absence of "music"
        from the MUTES and TRAINS sites. This "music" check request should be made at the initial
        call in to ensure the viewing of the requested signal by TRAINS operators.

     3.5. MUTES Procedures and Scenarios:

        3.5.1. Aircrews should request desired EA activity at MUTES or Mini-MUTES sites via
        electronic means during mission planning. Advance EA requests are imperative for Mini-
        MUTES activity. Due to the locations of remote Mini-MUTES pedestals, the aircraft may be
        engaged prior to the Initial Point (IP). If the EA request is not made in advance, the aircrew
        may receive incorrect or unwanted activity.
AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       15


   3.5.2. Aircrews have the following request options:

      3.5.2.1. Requesting "MUTES EA," will result in a site-selected scenario being presented.
      Mini MUTES sites will select a compatible scenario for each pedestal. Maximum
      proficiency and practice CORI/NORI scenarios will be presented only if specifically
      requested.

      3.5.2.2. Requesting a type of scenario, for example, "Tango."

      3.5.2.3. Requesting a specific scenario, for example, "Tango 02."

      3.5.2.4. Requesting the pre-coordinated scenario, for example, "Aircraft Call Sign 01."

   3.5.3. Aircrews will notify the site if MUTES signals do not appear on aircraft receivers.
   Reporting will be unclassified using the MUTES signal number published by HQ
   ACC/A3AR.

   3.5.4. MUTES Scenarios: Wing EWOs are responsible for ensuring specific scenarios are
   available to meet training requirements. Developed scenarios are available on the Nellis
   website (https://wwwmil.nellis.af.mil/units/range). HQ AFGSC and HQ ACC encourage
   feedback on developed scenarios which may enhance training. If developed scenarios do not
   meet training requirements, Wing EWOs will submit requests to HQ AFGSC/A3TO and once
   approved will submit requests to HQ ACC/A3IE for action. HQ ACC/A3IE will coordinate
   with HQ ACC/A3T and submit scenario requests to HQ ACC/A3A for implementation.

   3.5.5. Maximum Proficiency Scenarios. These scenarios simulate penetration of, and
   withdrawal from, areas heavily defended by various combinations of naval, strategic, tactical,
   and airborne defenses while over water during coastal, area, and target area penetrations.
   These scenarios are designed to provide a challenge for experienced aircrews and increase
   their proficiency against multiple threats. The Wing EWO will make the determination to
   allow credit based on the signal environment.

3.6. Mini-MUTES Procedures and Scenarios:

   3.6.1. The AN/MST-T1(V) Mini-MUTES is a smaller, more mobile version of the MST-T1A
   MUTES. There are seven Mini-MUTES configurations (pedestals), which combine
   transmitters identical to those used in the MUTES. Each pedestal is designed to simulate only
   a particular family of threat or acquisition signals. Each pedestal is referred to by letter: B, C,
   G, H, K, L, or M.

   3.6.2. Scheduling:

      3.6.2.1. Schedule Mini-MUTES via electronic requests during mission planning.
16                                                        AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010

            3.6.2.2. Aircrews not desiring inclusion of Mini-MUTES during an EA run will stipulate
            "MUTES ONLY" after their MUTES scenario request via electronic means on mission
            planning day.

            3.6.2.3. If MUTES are inoperable at a MUTES and Mini-MUTES-configured site, Mini-
            MUTES sites may schedule and present scenarios on a stand-alone basis.

     3.7. Multiple Threat Run Procedures. Aircrews may take credit for an MTR whenever an
     appropriate signal environment is encountered. Only MUTES maximum proficiency, practice
     CORI/NORI scenarios, MUTES combined with Mini-MUTES scenarios, and EA activity at
     ranges (e.g. RED FLAG) are MTR-creditable. The Wing EWO will make the determination to
     allow credit based on the signal environment.

4. PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING EXPENDABLE ACTIVITY

     4.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for expendable training activity. All AFGSC
     wings and AFGSC-gained units and crewmembers must comply with the applicable paragraphs of
     this chapter.

     4.2. Responsibilities. Wings must ensure that:

        4.2.1. All personnel concerned are familiar with AFI 10-706, AFI 11-214, AFI 11-215,
        CJCSM 3212.02, and this instruction.

        4.2.2. In compliance with CJCSM 3212.02, chaff will not be dropped in the U.S. except in
        those ranges, areas, routes, or military operating areas (MOA) that have been environmentally
        assessed. Environmental assessed areas are available through the HQ ACC/A3IE web site
        (https://a3.ACC.af.mil/doz/doze/).

     4.3. Chaff Drop Activity:

        4.3.1. Requirements to drop chaff.

            4.3.1.1. Environmental clearance.

            4.3.1.2. Frequency clearance IAW CJCSM 3212.02.

        4.3.2. Training chaff (RR-112) will normally be loaded and expended in a manner reflective
        of the combat environment being emulated for all training exercises. Conduct live chaff drop
        activity only in authorized special use airspace contained in current FLIP planning documents.
        Clearances for dropping RR-112 are located on HQ ACC/A3IE web site
        (https://a3.ACC.af.mil/doz/doze/). The flight should coordinate with the FAA. For air-to-air
        training, procedures will be accomplished per AFI 11-214. If training chaff is not available,
        wings may load and dispense RR-ZZZ, RR-170, or RR-180 chaff during training exercises
        whenever frequency and range clearances permit. Dispensing will be per the EA Mission
        Guides and the applicable volume of AFTTP 3-1. Failure to dispense chaff due to FAA,
AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010                                                                         17

   airspace, or environmental restrictions does not constitute loss of the air-to-air training
   exercise.

   4.3.3. The Wing EWO will develop local procedures to check aircraft chaff systems as
   required.

4.4. Flare Drop Activity:

   4.4.1. Conduct live flare drop activity only in authorized special use airspace contained in
   current FLIP planning documents and overwater firing areas.

      4.4.1.1. Special Use Airspace. Contact HQ ACC/A3AA, DSN 574-3169, for information
      on special use airspace.

      4.4.1.2. Restricted Areas. Restricted Areas may be used for flare drops provided the
      controlling agency has issued written permission on a case-by-case basis.

      4.4.1.3. Overwater. When impractical to overfly an authorized special use airspace
      (Whiskey Areas) or restricted areas, flare drops may be conducted overwater (other than
      inland water). The area will be at least 50 nautical miles from all shores and at least 25
      nautical miles from established airways and corridors listed in current aeronautical charts
      or oceanic area operating instructions. Furthermore, take care not to drop flares through
      another aircraft’s altitude.

   4.4.2. Procedures:

      4.4.2.1. Wings will comply with AFI 11-214.

   4.4.3. Safety Precautions:

      4.4.3.1. Ensure appropriate flare switches are in the off or safe position and circuit
      breakers (if applicable) are pulled until the aircraft is over the approved flare drop area.

      4.4.3.2. Flare activity will be suspended or terminated whenever the aircrew is unable to
      sufficiently ensure safe conduct of the activity.

   4.4.4. Communications:

      4.4.4.1. Before entering the airspace, the aircrew must contact the controlling agency and
      provide the following information:

          4.4.4.1.1. Type aircraft.

          4.4.4.1.2. Type training to be conducted.

          4.4.4.1.3. Proposed drop altitude.
18                                                          AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010

            4.4.4.2. The aircrew must contact the controlling agency before entering and departing the
            airspace.

        4.4.5. In case of an inadvertent flare drop, take the following actions:

            4.4.5.1. Immediately safe the applicable system by all available means.

            4.4.5.2. The aircrew must immediately notify air traffic control of the incidence's nature,
            location, and estimated damage (if any observed).

            4.4.5.3. Record the time and geographic coordinates of the inadvertent release.

            4.4.5.4. The unit to which the aircrew is assigned is responsible for complying with the
            applicable portions of AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints, as supplemented, and
            other applicable air-craft specific directives that apply to this instruction.

5. PEACETIME ELECTRONIC ATTACK EMISSION CONTROL (EMCON)
PROCEDURES

     5.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for protecting AFGSC's wartime EC
     capabilities from hostile exploitation. It applies to all AFGSC wings and gained units
     participating in EA training and exercises worldwide. The guidelines set forth in this chapter take
     precedence over AFGSC EA activities conducted in conjunction with AFGSC or joint exercises,
     tests, etc.

     5.2. Terms:

        5.2.1. EA Training. Any active transmission of electronic countermeasures in reaction to
        simulated threat radars or friendly radar systems for the purpose of peacetime training.

        5.2.2. TMDF. Training mission data file.

        5.2.3. OMDF. Operational mission data file.

     5.3. EA EMCON Guidance:

        5.3.1. The purpose of AFGSC's EA EMCON procedures is to prevent the hostile collection of
        wartime EA equipment settings, operations, and techniques that could compromise AFGSC's
        wartime capabilities and war plans. Wing EWOs will ensure their unit follows EMCON
        procedures established in this instruction both in and outside the CONUS. Air Force Warfare
        Center will develop training and/or exercise data/tapes with "generic" techniques, or less
        capable variations of combat settings, for use at ESSs, ranges, and OCONUS.

        5.3.2. The following applies for all CONUS exercises and lead-in/continuation training and
        testing on EA ranges:

            5.3.2.1. Air-to-Ground Testing and Training:
AFGSCI 10-709 1 OCTOBER 2010                                                               19


       5.3.2.1.1. Nellis and Eglin ranges are operated under controlled conditions and have
       specific procedures in place to preclude possible compromise. Only with an approved
       test plan will radiation of current combat or newly developed combat EA settings be
       authorized in support of testing (DT&E, IOT&E, QOT&E, FDE, and FOT&E).

       5.3.2.1.2. Wartime/combat settings in software reprogrammable EW systems will not
       be used on any training mission or on any range unless written authorization is
       received from HQ AFGSC/A3T and once approved HQ AFGSC/A3T will submit
       request to HQ ACC/A3I. Request will be made via SIPRNET
       (AFGSCA3TOWorkflow@barksdale.af.smil.mil) NLT 45 days prior to the sortie.
       AFGSC/A3TO must submit requests via SIPRNET (ACC.dozo@langley.af.smil.mil)

6. ELECTRONIC WARFARE ASSESSMENT PROGRAM:

     6.1. General. IAW AFI10-706, Electronic Warfare Operations, dated 30 November 2007,
     MAJCOMS will establish readiness standards for EW systems based on their operational
     requirements to ensure sufficient numbers of fully mission capable systems are available to meet
     operational commitments.

     6.2. Assessments.

        6.2.1. EW system assessments for B-52 aircraft will be accomplished IAW annual USM-464
        test results. Once an aircraft ―passes‖ the annual USM-464 test, the aircraft is considered
        Fully Mission Capable (FMC) from an EW standpoint and commanders will input the results
        into the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).

        6.2.2. EW system assessments for B-2 aircraft will be accomplished annually using Onboard
        Integrated Test System (OBITS) for the Defensive Management System (DMS). Once an
        aircraft ―passes‖ the annual OBITS test, the aircraft is considered Fully Mission Capable
        (FMC) from an EW standpoint and commanders will input the results into the Defense
        Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).
