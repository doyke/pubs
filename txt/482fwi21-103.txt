1. General:
     1.1. The three hot brake areas established at Homestead Air Reserve Base (HARB) are
     located at:
        1.1.1. Runway 23 end of runway (EOR), Spot 8.
        1.1.2. Runway 05 EOR, Spot 8.
        1.1.3. Hot Cargo Pad.
     1.2. The areas located at each end of the runway are appropriate for aborted take-offs or
     heavyweight landings where hot brakes are likely.
        1.2.1. Every effort should be made to park any aircraft with suspected hot brakes, facing
        into the wind at one of the three designated hot brake areas.
            1.2.1.1. It is generally recognized that excessive taxiing with hot brakes will create a
            more serious and potentially dangerous situation.
            1.2.1.2. Anytime a ground emergency for hot brakes is declared in a de-arm area, the
            de-arm operations for the rest of the aircraft is moved from taxiways Alpha or Echo
            End of Runway (EOR's) to Bravo or Delta until the emergency is terminated.
            Caution: At no time is a mechanical/digital device utilized to determine brake
            temperature.
2. Not Used.
3. Procedures.
     3.1. Ground Crew Procedures:
        3.1.1. Warning: DO NOT APPROACH TIRES, if a suspected hot brake condition
        exists. Refer to TO 1F-16C-6WC-1-11.
        3.1.2. Notify the pilot of a hot brake condition/alert using the hot brake hand signal and
        STAY CLEAR OF THE AIRCRAFT.
        3.1.3. If possible, use the Maintenance Net on a Land Mobile Radio, (LMR) to alert the
        482 MXG/Maintenance Operations Center (482 MXG/MOC) to call the 482d Mission
        Support Group/Fire Department (482 MSG/CEF).
        3.1.4. The area will be cleared of non-essential personnel for a minimum of 300ft in all
        directions.
        3.1.5. Avoid inflated Main Landing Gear (MLG) tire side area within 300 feet for 45
        minutes after aircraft has stopped.
        3.1.6. If required, approach from the front or rear for firefighting purposes only.
        3.1.7. After the ground emergency is terminated by the Fire Chief and waiting at least 45
        minutes from the time the aircraft has stopped, secure the aircraft and tow it to the
        appropriate parking location.
     3.2. Pilot Procedures:
        3.2.1. Suspected hot brakes immediately after landing:            Accomplish Hot Brake
        procedures IAW TO 1F-16C-1CL-1.
482FWI21-103 14 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               3


        3.2.1.1. If the pilot suspects that hot brakes are likely due to variables, such as
        landing heavy, a short runway or higher speeds, the aircraft should be taxied into Spot
        8 in the EOR. The aircraft nose should be into the wind and firefighting equipment
        requested, as soon as possible. Do not shut the engine down until instructed by the
        482 MSG/CEF due to a potential fuel fire hazard.
        3.2.1.2. Do not use the parking brake. Use only minimal brake pressure to hold
        aircraft stationary.
        3.2.1.3. Turn the Emergency Power Unit (EPU) switch to the OFF position.
        3.2.1.4. When directed by the Fire Chief, place the throttle in off. Caution: DO
        NOT TURN OFF MAIN POWER UNTIL AFTER THE NOSE WHEEL HAS BEEN
        CHOCKED. ONCE THE MAIN POWER SWITCH IS TURNED OFF, THE
        BRAKES WILL BE INOPERATIVE.
        3.2.1.5. Once 482 MSG/CEF chocks the nose wheel, turn the main power switch to
        off and exit the aircraft towards the front of the aircraft. If a brake fire occurs,
        perform a ground egress in accordance with TO 1F-16C-1CL-1. Warning: Ensure
        engine has stopped rotating before chocking nose wheel.
     3.2.2. Hot brakes discovered at EOR by de-arm personnel:
        3.2.2.1. If advised by de-arm personnel of a hot brake condition and if able, taxi to
        Spot 8 in the EOR. Do not use the parking brake. Use only minimal brake pressure
        to hold aircraft stationary. Keep the engine running, immediately call Homestead
        Ground Control and declare a ground emergency for hot brakes.
        3.2.2.2. Await the Fire Chief’s directions and accomplish procedures in paragraphs
        3.2.1.1 through 3.2.1.5, above. The de-arm operation for the rest of the aircraft will
        be moved from taxiways Alpha or Echo EOR's to Bravo or Delta until the emergency
        is terminated.
     3.2.3. Hot Brakes discovered at the MAKO Parking Ramp:
        3.2.3.1. If notified by maintenance personnel of a hot brake condition at the MAKO
        parking ramp, contact Homestead Ground Control immediately and declare a ground
        emergency for hot brakes.
        3.2.3.2. Taxi to the Hot Cargo Pad, if possible, or as far away as possible from other
        parked aircraft, personnel or other resources. Use only minimal braking pressure to
        stop aircraft and do not use the parking brake. Point the nose of the aircraft into the
        wind, if possible.
        3.2.3.3. Once the aircraft is parked, keep the engine running, await the Fire Chief’s
        directions and accomplish procedures in paragraphs 3.2.1.1 through 3.2.1.5, above.
  3.3. 482 MXG/MOC Procedures:
     3.3.1. Upon notification of a hot brake condition, MOC notifies the following:
        3.3.1.1. Notify MXG and base agencies per Hot Brake checklist E-21 and Ground
        Emergency checklist E-02.
  3.4. Crash Recovery Procedures:
4                                                   482FWI21-103 14 SEPTEMBER 2012


    3.4.1. A maintenance supervisor (Officer In Charge (OIC), Noncommissioned Officer In
    Charge (NCOIC), Pro-Super, Aircraft Generation Flight Chief, or Expediter) immediately
    responds to the Fire Chief or his assistant at the hot brake ground emergency location for
    instructions. Depending on the location of the emergency, it may become necessary to
    move other aircraft or resources away from the emergency area.
    3.4.2. Avoid inflated MLG tire side area within 300 feet for 45 minutes after aircraft has
    stopped.
    3.4.3. After the ground emergency is terminated by the Fire Chief and waiting at least 45
    minutes from the time the aircraft has stopped, secure the aircraft and tow it to the
    appropriate parking location.
