   as implemented by the Air Force. The MAJCOM/CE is the AHJ for approval of long-term
   (more than 18 months) deviations to NFPA standards. MAJCOM/CEs forward all requests
   for permanent deviations to NFPA standards to HQ USAF/ILE for approval. They ensure

   alarm systems installed in base facilities are “local alarm only”. Consequently, they serve
 10                                                            911AWI32-201 30 APRIL 2013

   recommendations regarding firefighting operational requirements. The fire inspector is not
   responsible for system design. The fire inspector coordinates on design drawings to signify
   review and that firefighting operational recommendations are incorporated. The coordination
   does not indicate fire protection engineering design acceptance.
   1.8.4. Review and approval by the authority having jurisdiction shall not relieve the
   applicant of the responsibility of compliance with this instruction.
   1.8.5. Where field conditions necessitate any substantial changes from the approved plan,
   the authority having jurisdiction shall have the authority to require the corrected plans be
   submitted for approval.
