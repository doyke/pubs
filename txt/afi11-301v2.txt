        spectacles.
     2.10.3.3. Block Zero (Block 0). (T-1)
        2.10.3.3.1. Item Description. Block 0 spectacles are designed to fit in the Air Force
        Frame and were procured as a COTS item. The spectacle is composed of a thin film
        containing the laser protective properties bonded between two polycarbonate
        elements laminated together to form a lens. The lenses are then glazed into the Air
        Force Frame and temple arm is etched with a serial number. Each spectacle lens is
        custom fitted to the frame and is not interchangeable. (T-1)
        2.10.3.3.2. Capability. Block 0 spectacles provide laser protection by reflecting a
        percentage of incident radiation. The spectacle can minimize temporary effects of
        dazzle or glare and prevent permanent eye damage from low power lasers in selected
        visible and invisible spectral regions. Block 0 spectacles are optimized for night
        operations and may be prone to exhibit signs of reflection or glare when worn during
        daylight hours. Attachable side shield protection is available for use with Block 0
        spectacles from Glendale Technologies. Specific wavelength characteristics of this
        device are available upon request from HQ ACC/A3TOA, Langley AFB VA. (T-1)
        2.10.3.3.3. Warnings and Limitations. ALEP devices are designed to protect against
        specific laser energy wavelengths. Therefore, incorrect usage or subjecting the
        spectacles to conditions outside certified specifications may result in a degradation of
        performance and potential risk of exposing the user to a laser hazard/threat. Block 0 is
        certified safe for flight during day and night operations. Subsequently, any pair of
        spectacles viewed as excessively reflective should be annotated and removed from
        service. (T-1)
        2.10.3.3.4. Fitting. Spectacles should be properly fitted prior to use in a laser
        hazard/threat area. They should fit as close to the face as possible maximizing the
AFI11-301V2 20 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  21


        area of protection. There should be minimal gaps between the frame and side of the
        nose. Temple’s arms should press lightly against side of the head, and earpieces
        should curve downward following the back of ear to prevent spectacle from sliding
        out of position. (T-1)
        2.10.3.3.5. Pre-Use Inspection and Maintenance. (T-1)
            2.10.3.3.5.1. Check spectacle frame for signs of damage. (T-1)

            when not in use. Basic information on use, storage and cleaning is included in the
            hard carrying case. (T-1)
            2.10.3.3.5.4. Remove dust on optical lens surface with the cleaning bag provided.
            Ensure cleaning bag is clean prior to use. The cloth bag can be cleaned as
            necessary by hand or machine-washed in water temperatures up to 140°F. (T-1)
            2.10.3.3.5.5. Remove dirt or grit from lens surface using a water moistened lens
            tissue taking care not to trap abrasive matter between the tissue and polycarbonate
            surfaces. Soap or a mild detergent similar to Ivory Liquid should be used to
            remove greasy stains or smears. Do not use petroleum spirit or other solvents to
            clean spectacles. Dry the optical surfaces using a clean dry lens tissue. (T-1)
        2.10.3.3.6. Periodic Inspection and Maintenance.
            2.10.3.3.6.1. AFE personnel will inspect Block 0 spectacles for serviceability
            upon receipt and every 180 days thereafter. Document inspection in FERMS or
            other approved tracking system. (T-1)
            2.10.3.3.6.2. Inspect lenses for signs of delamination. Delamination can be
            verified by carefully looking through the spectacle lenses from a distance of
            approximately 12 inches. Delamination will look like growth rings on a tree
            cross-section, a series of partial rings or slight color differences from rest of the
            lens. Delamination usually starts in the corners of the lens. Except in extreme
            cases, delamination does not diminish laser protection properties. Do not use if
            either lens shows signs of delamination between front and rear polycarbonate that
            affects aircrew vision or exceeds 4mm in any direction. (T-1)
            2.10.3.3.6.3. Visually inspect and ensure individual lenses are secure in frame. If
            the frame is damaged, lenses cannot be recovered for further use because lenses
            are custom matched to each frame. (T-1)
            2.10.3.3.6.4. Remove from service spectacles displaying scratches in primary
            focal region. Lenses are coated with an anti-reflective coating that does not
            impact performance of the laser protective properties when scratched. However,
            scratches may be distracting when appearing in the primary focal region and
            should be removed from service. (T-1)
     2.10.3.4. Block Zero Plus (Block 0+) Spectacle (Model B) and Clip-on (Model D).
        2.10.3.4.1. Block 0+ laser protective devices were procured as COTS items in FY02

     2.10.3.4.3. Block 0+ ALEP added protection beyond Block 0 and are certified safe
     for flight. Wearing Block 0+ may result in a slight change in appearance of some
     colors. However, any pair of spectacles observed to promote excessive reflection or
     color shifts should be annotated and removed from service. Spectacles should not be
     exposed to temperatures below - 4°F or above 131°F. (T-1)
     2.10.3.4.4. Block 0+ spectacles must be fitted using the following procedures:
        2.10.3.4.4.1. Fit spectacles as close to face as possible with minimal gaps
        between the frame and side of the nose. The nose pads can be adjusted with
        needle nose pliers to minimize gaps, reduce entrance of stray radiation and
        improve comfort. The temple arms should press lightly against side of the head
        and earpieces should curve downward following back of the ear to prevent
        spectacles from sliding out of position. (T-1)
        2.10.3.4.4.2. Block 0+ Clip-On (Model D) is designed to attach to outer surface
        of the new AFF aircrew spectacle 55 mm frame. Clip-on attachment hooks should
        tightly "grasp" spectacle frame. Do not attempt to attach the clip-on to older style
        aircrew frame. Doing so will damage clip-on and create a foreign object damage
        (FOD) hazard. (T-1)
     2.10.3.4.5. Users requiring prescription capability have two options available. (T-1)
        2.10.3.4.5.1. Option 1: A combination of contact lens and the Model B spectacle.
        (T-1)
        2.10.3.4.5.2. Option 2: A combination of aircrew prescription spectacles and
        Model D clip-on. While this option provides the required capability, it adds
        additional weight to spectacle, creates additional reflections and some loss of
        visual acuity. (T-1)
     2.10.3.4.6. Block 0+ Pre-Use Inspection and Maintenance. (T-1)
        2.10.3.4.6.1. Check spectacle frame for signs of damage. (T-1)
AFI11-301V2 20 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  23


            2.10.3.4.6.2. Check to ensure lenses are secure in the frame. (T-1)
            2.10.3.4.6.3. Store spectacles in micro fiber cloth bag and hard carrying case
            when not in use. Basic information on use, storage and cleaning is included in
            hard carrying case. (T-1)
            2.10.3.4.6.4. Remove dust on the optical lens surface with cleaning bag provided.
            Ensure cleaning bag is clean prior to use. The cloth bag can be cleaned as
            necessary by hand or machine-washed in water temperatures up to 140°F. (T-1)
            2.10.3.4.6.5. Remove dirt or grit from lens surface using a water moistened lens
            tissue taking care not to trap abrasive matter between the tissue and polycarbonate
            surfaces. Soap or a mild detergent similar to Ivory Liquid should be used to
            remove greasy stains or smears. Do not use petroleum spirit or other solvents to
            clean spectacles. Dry the optical surfaces using a clean dry lens tissue. (T-1)
        2.10.3.4.7. Block 0+ Periodic Inspection and Maintenance.
            2.10.3.4.7.1. AFE personnel will inspect Block 0+ spectacle/Clip-on for
            serviceability upon receipt and every 180 days thereafter. Document inspection in
            applicable tracking system. (T-1)
            2.10.3.4.7.2. Inspect lenses for signs of delamination. Delamination can be
            verified by carefully looking through spectacle lenses from a distance of
            approximately 12 inches. Delamination will look like growth rings on a tree
            cross-section, a series of partial rings or slight color differences from rest of the
            lens. Delamination usually starts in the corners of the lens. Except in extreme
            cases, delamination does not diminish laser protection properties. Do not use if
            either lens shows signs of delamination between front and rear polycarbonate that
            affects aircrew vision or exceeds 4 mm in any direction. (T-1)
            2.10.3.4.7.3. Visually inspect and ensure individual lenses are secure in the
            frame. If the frame is damaged, lenses cannot be recovered for further use because
            lenses are custom matched to each frame. (T-1)
            2.10.3.4.7.4. Lenses are coated with an anti-reflective coating that does not
            impact performance of laser protective properties when scratched. However,
            scratches may be distracting when appearing in the primary focal region and may
            require removed from service. (T-1)
     2.10.3.5. Block One (1) Spectacle. Refer to T.O. 14P3-9-51
     2.10.3.6. JHMCS Compatible ALEP Spectacles (JCAS).
        2.10.3.6.1. The JCAS design is a rapid response effort to provide laser protection for
        JHMCS users. The required laser protection is contained within a laminated
        polycarbonate lens structure. The JCAS lenses are housed in the Low Pro Wrap frame
        providing a one-size-fits-all configuration. Each spectacle is marked with a serial
        number and identification code on the frame. JCAS is visually compatible with
        JHMCS (Joint Helmeted Mounted Cueing System) display and designed to work with
        the 40% JHMCS visor. Required design eliminated prescription capability and
        reduced field of regard coverage (compared to Block 1) to accommodate fit in limited
        space behind the JHMCS visor. (T-1)
 24                                                      AFI11-301V2 20 DECEMBER 2013


         2.10.3.6.2. JCAS spectacles implement technologies that reflect or absorb specific
         laser wavelengths. JCAS will minimize temporary effects (e.g., dazzle or glare) and
         permanent eye damage from lasers of selected wavelengths in UV, visible, and NIR.
         JCAS does not provide vision correction for prescription wearers and is not designed
         for night use. JCAS spectacles are optimized for day use with 40% JHMCS visor and
         are fit compatible with JHMCS helmet/visor/mask system. (T-1)
         2.10.3.6.3. Wearing JCAS may cause some difficulty in determining actual color of
         lighting and may cause some color shifts. Aircrew should receive specific training
         unique to JCAS to ensure they can identify lighting patterns and color shifts while
         wearing the device. JCAS spectacles are day-only devices optimized for performance
         and protection with 40% JHMCS visor. JCAS is not intended for night use. Always
         store JCAS in the protective case to prevent unnecessary solarization of the lenses.
         (T-1)
         2.10.3.6.4. Fitting JCAS. JCAS is provided in one size to fit all users. AFE
         Technicians fit JCAS to pilots by adjusting temple arms and nose pads to
         accommodate oxygen mask and JHMCS visor while providing optimal lens coverage
         over each eye. Spectacles must be properly fitted prior to use in a laser hazard/threat
         area. Specific fitting instructions are contained in the JCAS Technical Manual. (T-1)
         2.10.3.6.5. JCAS Pre-Use Inspection and Maintenance. Inspect JCAS spectacles for
         visible lens scratches or frame damage. Use only the cleaning cloth/bag provided or
         high quality lens tissue for wiping the lens. Always store spectacles in protective case
         when not in use. Consult JCAS Technical Manual for specific pre-use inspection and
         maintenance procedures.
         2.10.3.6.6. JCAS Periodic Inspection and Maintenance. (T-1)
            2.10.3.6.6.1. AFE personnel will inspect JCAS spectacles for serviceability upon
            receipt and every 180 days thereafter. Document spectacle inspections in the
            applicable tracking system. The JCAS frame and lenses will be inspected for
            damage or defects.(T-1)
            2.10.3.6.6.2. Inspect lenses for signs of delamination. Delamination can be
            verified by carefully looking through spectacle lenses from a distance of
            approximately 12 inches. Delamination will look like growth rings on a tree
            cross-section, a series of partial rings or slight color differences from rest of the
            lens. Delamination usually starts in the corners of the lens. Except in extreme
            cases, delamination does not diminish laser protection properties. Do not use if
            either lens shows signs of delamination between front and rear polycarbonate that
            affects aircrew vision or exceeds 4 mm in any direction. (T-1)
            2.10.3.6.6.3. AFE will consult the JCAS technical manual for additional
            inspection criteria. (T-1)

     2.11.2.2. Option #2: Create a separate “Mini” D-1 bag with one complete CBRN
     ensemble (remaining D-bag sustainment/BOI items will be in a second bag/storage
     container). (T-1)
     2.11.2.3. Option #3: Maintain "Mini" D-1 bags with remaining D-Bag BOI items as
     "bulk stored". Units will ensure bulk stored items can meet full D-Bag requirements for
     their unit and is fully deployable. (T-1)
     2.11.2.4. AECMs have unique ACBRN requirements. Until JSAM is fielded, AECM
     will use the M50 ground crew mask and filters issued as part of the C-Bag. AECM D-
     Bag BOI deviation guidance is outlined in Table 3.3. (T-1)
     2.11.2.5. E-3, E-8, RC/TC/VC/WC-135 aircrew have unique ACBRN requirements.
     Until JSAM is fielded, these aircrew will use the MBU-13/P mask, with modified
     manifold and pigtail adaptor or AERPS as applicable. E-3, E-8, RC/TC/VC/WC-135
     aircrew D-Bag BOI deviation guidance is outlined in Table 3.3. (T-1)
     2.11.2.6. UH-1 (AFGSC and AFDW) have unique ACBRN requirements. Until JSAM
     is fielded, UH-1 aircrew will use the M45 ground crew mask and filters. UH-1 BOI
     deviation guidance is outlined in Table 3.3. (T-1)
     2.11.2.7. Units will produce locally developed checklists and place them in the D-1 bag
     for ACBRN equipment donning that best suits mission needs and equipment
     configuration.
  2.11.3. As a minimum, aircrews will be sized, fitted and issued a “Mini” D-1 bag. (T-1)
     2.11.3.1. Aircrews deploying into CBRN threat areas will hand carry one complete
     ACBRN equipment “Mini” D-1 bag unless otherwise directed by MAJCOM guidance.
     (T-1)
     2.11.3.2. Units must also comply with theater specific reporting instructions for ACBRN
     requirements when the “Mini” D-1 bag is insufficient to meet their requirements. Follow
     theater, MAJCOM, and unit specific guidance for employed area operations and
     redeployment. (T-1)
     2.11.3.3. Units should report all shortfalls through their home station or deployed
     leadership to minimize impact on ACBRN capability.
  2.11.4. Procedures will be established for mass filter element and battery installation. (T-1)
     2.11.4.1. Close coordination should be maintained between AFE and the flying unit in
     order to ensure D-Bags are prepared for issue or deployments. (T-1)
26                                                       AFI11-301V2 20 DECEMBER 2013


  2.11.4.2. Units are not required to open and install BA-5588/U Batteries in the CQU-7/P
  Blower, C2A1 Filters on the CQU-7/P blower/AERP manifold, Emergency and Inline O2
  Filters, and 9 volt Alkaline Batteries in the MXU-835/P Intercommunication Unit when
  preparing D and D-1 bags for deployment. All of these items may be bulk stored/shipped
  and installed when directed. (T-1)
         2.11.4.2.1. The Combatant Command may issue direction when to install these items
         once in the deployed theater depending on the current CBRN threat level. AFE may
         use filter and battery “shop test sets” (instead of opening new filters and batteries) to
         accomplish routine/periodic inspections as well as prepare equipment for aircrew pre-
         flight procedures. Units will follow specific MAJCOM guidance for local and higher
         headquarters exercises and evaluations. (T-1)
         2.11.4.2.2. When crew members return from contingencies and AERP equipment
         was not used, remove the batteries, and keep them in their original sets. Additionally,
         to prevent fire or explosion store batteries in plastic bags. If batteries were used,
         remove from blower assembly and mark for training use prior to placing them in a
         plastic bag. (T-1)
  2.11.5. Joint Protective Aircrew Ensemble (JPACE) and CWU-66/P coverall.
     2.11.5.1. JPACE and the CWU-66/P are the primary aircrew below-the-shoulder
     chemical protective garment for all aircrew. JPACE will replace the CWU-66/P on an
     attrition basis. (T-1)
     2.11.5.2. Aircrews are responsible for tracking service-life/laundering of the JPACE or
     CWU-66/P. When JPACE or CWU-66/P is removed from package, annotate the date
     removed with permanent ink on the laundry instruction label. (T-1)
  2.11.6. Cotton undergarments.
     2.11.6.1. Cotton undergarments are optional with the JPACE and CWU-66/P. This
     option must be determined by individual aircrew, not AFE personnel. (T-1)
     2.11.6.2. Units will maintain sufficient quantities of cotton undergarments in order to
     provide individual aircrew the option to have these items placed in their bags. If the
     aircrew opts to have cotton underwear in their bags, the BOI for the D/D-1 bag will be
     based on the quantities Table 3.3 and the items will be installed in the D/D-1 Bag. If an
     individual aircrew member does not desire to have cotton underwear in his or her bags,
     AFE is not required to install cotton underwear in their D/D-1 bag. (T-1)
     2.11.6.3. Since cotton underwear is an expendable item, the AFE shop supervision will
     determine appropriate stock levels to support this aircrew option. (T-1)
  2.11.7. Filter, oxygen emergency assembly. This filter is only required when the MBU-19/P
  is used with a parachute. Per TO 14P3-1-151, non-ejection type aircraft not utilizing a bail-
  out bottle are not required to replace the O2 oxygen filter as long as the emergency O2

     be added in the D/D-1 bag. (T-1)
     2.11.10.2. Use the expiration date stamped on the battery to determine date of expiration
     as long as it passes voltage inspection. (T-1)
     2.11.10.3. Battery test using ZTS multi battery tester. The ZTS test sets sample the
     amount of voltage remaining in a battery. A row of red, yellow, and green light-emitting
     diodes (LED) arranged in pairs of two illuminate as it samples the voltage. The final
     color, indicates the voltage is within limits if the green led illuminate, which indicates a
     voltage of 80% or greater.
     2.11.10.4. 1.5 volt AA battery or 9 volt test using multi-meter or ALSET. (T-1)
         2.11.10.4.1. To use a multimeter to check battery voltage, place the red probe on the
         positive (+) terminal and the black probe on the negative (-) terminal, observe voltage
         reading.
         2.11.10.4.2. AA batteries with a reading of less than 1.0 volt and 9 volt batteries with
         a reading of less than 7.2 volts will be replaced. (T-1)
  2.11.11. Procedures For Using ACBRN Equipment For Training.
     2.11.11.1. Crew members should use their individually issued or fitted “above-the-
     shoulder” AERP/JSAM equipment for wing exercises and flying-type training IAW
     MAJCOM IG rules of engagement or instructions. Do not use operational ensembles for
     AFE continuation training which could result in damage to war readiness assets. (T-1)
     2.11.11.2. Units will maintain ACBRN equipment for training purposes. Units will
     maintain tariff sized training bags to support crew members during recurring training and
     local exercises. If tariff sized training bags are maintained, units will ensure a sufficient
     amount of bags are on-hand. Inspect and mark training equipment. (T-1)
     2.11.11.3. The standard CWU-27/P flight suit adequately replicates the JPACE or CWU-
     66/P suits for training purposes. However, units may use expired real world suits for
     training when expired suits and storage space are available. (T-1)
     2.11.11.4. In addition to the “above-the-shoulder” equipment, one training ensemble for
     AERP equipment will consist of: 1 each C2A1 filter canister; 1 each pair/set of lithium
 28                                                       AFI11-301V2 20 DECEMBER 2013


      batteries; 2 each plastic overcapes; 1 pair of butyl gloves w/inserts; 2 pairs of overboots;
      and 3 suspension straps. (T-1)
      2.11.11.5. Quantities of ACBRN equipment accountable item quantities used for training
      are addressed in Allowance Standards 450A (Combat Air Force (CAF)) and 450E
      (MAF). (T-1)
          2.11.11.5.1. The allowances are maximum quantities allowed and units should use
          good supply discipline principles to determine their actual training requirements.
          Units are not required to have the maximum training quantity. Active duty and
          AFRC units should adjust training quantities based on local needs. ANG units will
          adjust training quantities as directed by ANG NGB/A3OS. ANG NGB/A3OS current
          policy limits units to eight (8) training assets per unit. All training equipment must be
          clearly marked “for training use only.” (T-1)
          2.11.11.5.2. Units may retain training assets of non-accountable items that exceed the
          quantities of accountable item. However, it is not necessary for each aircrew to have
          his or her own training bag. (T-1)
      2.11.11.6. Aircrew will turn-in ACBRN training equipment to AFE immediately after
      use. (T-1)
2.12. Emergency Electronic Communication and Signaling Equipment.
   2.12.1. Combat Survivor Evader Locator (CSEL). Lead Command—ACC. The USAF is
   lead service for the CSEL architecture. Units may use the PRC-112 series radio until they
   receive their CSEL equipment complement. Exception: AETC units are authorized use of
   PRC-90 series radios until receipt of CSEL or equivalent radio. (T-1)
      2.12.1.1. The AN/PRQ-7 series hand held radio (HHR) is the DoD system of record for
      isolated personnel recovery.
          2.12.1.1.1. These devices provide over-the-horizon and line-of-sight communication
          as-well-as 406 MHz personnel locator beacon and GPS capabilities.
          2.12.1.1.2. The AN/PRQ-7 series HHR incorporates National Security Agency
          approved Communications Security (COMSEC) techniques to protect CSEL against
          extraction of crypto keys.
          2.12.1.1.3. The AN/PRQ-7A HHR Incorporates Terminal Area Communications
          (TAC) and Terminal Area Guidance (TAG).
      2.12.1.2. All AFE units must (AETC excluded): (T-1)
          2.12.1.2.1. Establish COMSEC and crypto accounts to requisition materials required
          for programming of the CSEL HHR. Provide status of new accounts to their
          respective MAJCOM staff. Units without the requirement to load classified data to
          CSEL HHRs do not need to establish a COMSEC or crypto account. Note: Use of
          another flight’s or section’s crypto account is authorized, provided AFE has
          unrestricted access to required material. (T-1)
          2.12.1.2.2. Establish Automated Computer Program Identification Number (ACPIN)
          and Electronic Software Distribution System (ESDS) accounts to access software
          applicable to CSEL system management. (T-1)

     used in lieu of MA-1 kits but due to different life raft sizes MA-1 kits are not a suitable
     substitute for MA-2 kits. (T-1)
  2.17.3. Survival Vests.
     2.17.3.1. For all HH-60 aircrew, wear of survival vest during local sorties will be at the
     discretion of the responsible operations group commander based on ORM and procedures
     published in AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volume 3, Chapter 8 (Local Procedures).
     Commanders will incorporate guidance regarding survival vest wear and survival
     component placement (i.e. PRC-90, PRC-112 and CSEL radios) into local AFE
     supplements. Survival vests will be worn for all cross-country missions, contingencies
     and combat exercises. (T-1)
     2.17.3.2. On bomber aircraft, wear of the survival vest during local sorties and cross
     country missions will be at the discretion of group commanders (or equivalent) based on
     risk management, and procedures published in AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volume 3,
     Chapter 8 (Local Procedures). Survival vest will be worn for all contingencies and
     combat exercises. (T-1)
     2.17.3.3. The location of pockets on survival vests will be standardized to the maximum
     extent possible. Units must pay special attention to the location of survival vest pockets
     to ensure AFE does not interfere with aircraft controls. (T-1)
     2.17.3.4. Survival vests in storage for deployment commitments will be configured to the
     maximum extent possible. (T-1)
     2.17.3.5. Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) Only. The 1 HS/CC will determine
     when survival vests (or kits) are required based upon local mission needs. The
     commander will consider remote flying areas and rescue recovery time. If the
     commander determines that survival vests are not required based on mission needs, the
     Flight Engineer is authorized to use the gunner’s belt for duties when movement within
     the cabin of the aircraft is required. (T-1)
     2.17.3.6. Air Ace™/Ace Advantage™ [Air Advantage™] Survival Vest.  Lead
     Command—AMC.        Until a new system is approved and supported by the

         alternative holster system used to carry M-9 pistol on the PSGC and thigh
         configurations to achieve the required magazine retainability. Aircrew members will
         continue to use the Air Warrior “shoulder rigging” holster/assembly if they choose to
         wear the holster in the shoulder configuration. (T-1)
  2.17.4. Aircraft Minimum Survival Kit (MSK). Lead Command—AMC.
     2.17.4.1. MSKs are mandatory when life rafts are not installed during PDM input from
     stateside locations. Therefore, during aircraft ferry and depot deliveries, use the MSK as a
     means of providing minimum signaling and survival component needs. MAJCOMs have
     the option of using a survival vest as a substitute for the MSK during PDM inputs (vests
     are required when carrying parachutes aboard the aircraft). (T-1)
     2.17.4.2. MSK components are listed in this publication (see Table 3.5). Place these
     survival components in a locally purchased or manufactured metal or fiberglass
     container, or equivalent, to provide protection of survival items. (T-1)
     2.17.4.3. Inspect the MSK on a one-year cycle. Time change items and munitions
     installed in MSKs going to depot facilities will have a minimum of one-year remaining
     on service life. When the MSK is carried on commercial airlines, remove the following
     items IAW TO 00-20-1: Signal, smoke and illumination, MK-13 or MK-124; Signal kit,
     personnel distress, A/P 25S-5A; container, waterproof (with matches); and knife, pocket.

   2.17.6. Aircraft Protective Clothing Kit (PCK). Lead Command—AMC.
      2.17.6.1. PCKs contain protective clothing for use by aircrew during emergencies aboard
      aircraft carrying hazardous cargo IAW Air Force Joint Manual (AFJMAN) 24-204,
      Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. See Table 3.6. as a general
      guide for components. Units may build kits IAW AFJMAN 24-204 or purchase
      commercial kits meeting or exceeding AFJMAN 24-204 requirements. Units should
      contact base environmental or fire protection personnel to determine adequacy of
      commercial kits being considered. (T-1)
      2.17.6.2. Inspect PCKs on a one-year cycle. Pack and seal PCKs in a locally
      manufactured metal, fiberglass, or plastic commercial container not to exceed 12 x 18 x
      24 inches. Attach a DD Form 1574 to each container indicating the date inspected and
      date due next inspection. Stencil each PCK with at least l-inch letters with the following:
      (T-1)

   2.17.7. LFA Alert Mission Equipment.
      2.17.7.1. Rations and water are placed aboard alert aircraft as a source of subsistence for
      aircrews during Emergency War Order (EWO) commitments. Requirements for
      subsistence items are shared responsibilities among AFE (delivery, uploading, and
      downloading), Operations and Plans (quantify as per mission needs), and Services
      (commissary liaison, approval agency, and memorandum of understanding [MOU]).
      Representatives from these organizations will establish a MOU. The MOU will specify
      and define responsibilities for forecasting, funding, requisitioning, storing, and issuing
      rations to best meet the unit’s OPLAN 8010 mission. Responsibilities for subsistence
      rations and water are contained in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Material (WRM) Program
      Guidance and Procedures. Due to the lack of proper refrigerated storage facilities within
      AFE facilities, some rations will require courtesy storage at appropriate facilities. (T-1)
AFI11-301V2 20 DECEMBER 2013                                                                39


     2.17.7.2. In addition to alert commitments, AFE may also be tasked to load rations,
     water, and flash blindness devices to support generated force sortie aircraft during EWO
     operations and when required by specific OPLANS. Units should establish procedures to
     upload and download these items and ensure availability of an aircraft storage location.
     This capability will be demonstrated during all IG inspections to the extent necessary to
     prove operational capability. (T-1)
     2.17.7.3. KC-135/KC-46A units tasked with OPLAN 8010 will establish aircraft live-
     aboard capability consisting of live-aboard kits (LAK), 3 cases of cold weather (CW) or 4
     cases of meal-ready-to-eat rations and 1,800 ounces of water, and a carbon monoxide
     detector, as a minimum IAW AMCI 10-450, Volume 3, Aircraft Performance Factors
     (classified). Aircrew LAK specific items are satisfied by the issue of individual mobility
     bags. (T-1)
        2.17.7.3.1. During live-aboard conditions, carbon monoxide detectors are required
        for all models of KC-135/KC-46A aircraft. (T-1)
        2.17.7.3.2. MAF KC-135 and KC-46A units supporting OPLAN 8010 missions are
        authorized to purchase and use the Fluke CO-220 Carbon Monoxide Meter. The CO-
        220 replaces the circa 1950's "Detector Gas Kits" maintained throughout the fleet.
        Meters being replaced are considered expendable items and are to be disposed of as
        such. (T-1)
        2.17.7.3.3. The CO-220 meter can be purchased from any authorized source. The
        meter is used solely to support aircrew members' survivability aboard aircraft,
        therefore deemed an appropriate item to utilize Cost Per Flying Hour funds to
        purchase the meter. (T-1)
        2.17.7.3.4. An annual commercial calibration is required on the meter. IAW 33K-
        series guidance, this is a “Note 64” item, indicating that calibration will be
        coordinated/funded through the Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment
        laboratory. Units will inspect meters on an annual basis, to align with calibration
        requirements, utilizing self-test guidance from the meter commercial instruction
        sheet. Track and document inspections using applicable documentation database and
        affix a completed NL555 to the item. Ensure batteries have a minimum of 80% usage
        remaining. Do not store meters with batteries installed. Meter location/operation will
        be covered in LL06. Units are authorized to purchase additional meter(s) for training
        use. Each meter will be stored/placed in a protective case to prevent damage while on
        aircraft, in transit, or in storage. (T-1)
     2.17.7.4. If AFGSC aircraft configuration requires rations and water, a minimum of two
     (2) Meals Ready-to-Eat per crewmember per day and two five-gallon jugs of water will
     be pre-positioned. Water bulk stored for aircraft configuration during increased stages of
     alert will be inspected annually. (T-1)

      2.17.8.4. Units will record and track the following data: Size, Lot Number, Serial
      Number, and DOM. (T-1)
      2.17.8.5. Aircrew Body Armor, Ace Advantage level IIIA, is available from Advantac
      Inc. (formerly Survival Incorporated and Ultimate Survival, Inc). Units are directed to
      replace assets that are beyond the manufacturers recommended five year service life. (T-
      1)
      2.17.8.6. Inspect commercially procured ABA pre-positioned on aircraft, stored in
      mobility bins, and placed in storage every 365 days. Inspect ABA worn on a daily basis
      every 90 days. Inspect and maintain as follows: (T-1)
          2.17.8.6.1. Inspect ABA pre-positioned on aircraft when the seal of the storage
          container is broken. (T-1)
          2.17.8.6.2. Units are authorized to repair or replace parts. If damage is found beyond
          repair, the ABA will be condemned and the whole unit will be replaced. (T-1)
          2.17.8.6.3. Inspect ABA cover for cuts, tears, fraying, seam separations, and loose
          stitching. Inspect the general condition of slide fasteners for proper operation, fast
          track fasteners and all other applicable hardware. Inspect waist band, shoulder straps,
          and hook/pile fastener tapes for frays or damaged areas and to ensure they function
          properly. Any damage noted will require an additional visual inspection of the
          ballistic panel inserts. (T-1)
          2.17.8.6.4. Pay particular attention to ensure body panels are not wet (or water
          stained). (T-1)
          2.17.8.6.5. Visually check manufacturers label to ensure all writing is fully legible.
          (T-1)
          2.17.8.6.6. Reinstall panels. When replacing the panels, you must ensure the correct
          side is facing out and away from the wearers body. Failure to do so can cause extreme
          bodily injury and/or death. Each panel is labeled to indicate which side must face the
          wearer. (T-1)
AFI11-301V2 20 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    41


         2.17.8.6.7. ABA contaminated with undetermined substances will be removed from
         service, as it may degrade effectiveness and fire retardant properties. (T-1)
         2.17.8.6.8. Inspect side panels as follows: ensure there are no open seams, tears,
         snags, wetness, and or stains. No repairs can be accomplished on these items and they
         must be replaced if found to be unserviceable. (T-1)
         2.17.8.6.9. To retain fire retardant properties, ABA cover should not be washed more
         than 15 times. Document washings on applicable inspection record. (T-1)
         2.17.8.6.10. The ballistic insert panels should never be submerged in water or
         machine washed. (T-1)
         2.17.8.6.11. Soiled ABA covers may be spot cleaned by hand with warm water using
         mild soap (Ivory or equivalent). Remove ballistic insert panels prior to cleaning.
         Hang garment up to dry in a well-ventilated area. (T-1)
         2.17.8.6.12. The ABA covers are machine washable (never dry clean). Remove
         ballistic insert panels prior to washing. Wash in warm, not hot, water (105F, +/- 5F).
         Close all zippers and pockets prior to machine washing. Tumble dry on permanent
         press setting or hang to air dry. Do not bleach. Do not iron or press. (T-1)
         2.17.8.6.13. Repair of ABA covers will be limited to sewing of rips, loose stitching,
         seam separations, patching when necessary with like fabric, and replacing snaps and
         slide fasteners with like items. (T-1)
         2.17.8.6.14. All repairs requiring sewing will be done with nylon thread conforming
         to specification V-T-295, type II, class 1, size E, nylon (NSN 8315-00-616-0079 or

         upper left cover area. Stencil with subdued, indelible ink using 1/2 inch lettering. Do
         not mark ABA with unit designation, to include SRAN, since aircrew may need this
         item in an escape and evasion environment. (T-1)
2.18. Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Member Support. Lead Command—AMC.
  2.18.1. It is the responsibility of the local AFE program assigned to support the Aeromedical
  Evacuation Squadron(s) to individually issue AFE to AECMs for flying sorties and
  deployments. (T-1)
 42                                                       AFI11-301V2 20 DECEMBER 2013


   2.18.2. AECM unit commanders will, through active coordination with their supporting AFE
   unit, develop a process for AECMs to sign out AFE from their supporting AFE unit. AECMs
   will sign out AFE individually on AF Form 1297 or equivalent and be personally accountable
   and liable for assigned AFE. AECMs will return assigned AFE to the AFE unit upon
   completion of flying sortie and deployment. AECMs will ensure AFE receives inspection by
   a qualified AFE technician at established intervals. Funding of initial asset purchases is the
   responsibility of the AE unit. (T-1)
   2.18.3. AFE unit commanders will, through active coordination with their supported AE
   unit, individually issue AFE to AECMs for all flying sorties and deployments. AFE units
   will maintain a pool of equipment (see below) to support the maximum number of AECM
   flyers/deployers at a given time. Funding of repair parts/replacement assets is the
   responsibility of the AFE unit. (T-1)
   2.18.4. AFE requirements for AECMs:
      2.18.4.1. Quick Don Oxygen Mask: Required for all flights and inspected IAW
      applicable technical orders by AFE personnel. (T-1)
      2.18.4.2. Survival Vest: Required for combat flights only. Munitions are optional for
      AECM vests. Ensure alternative signaling devices are available IAW AOR SPINS. AFE
      transported via commercial air should have items removed that are considered hazardous
      or unacceptable by TSA standards. (T-1)
      2.18.4.3. Aircrew Body Armor: Required for combat flights only. AFE will inspect
      ABA IAW applicable TO, guidance in this instruction and specific MAJCOM guidance.
      2.18.4.4. Life Preserver Units (LPU). LPUs are required for overwater flights only.
      Passenger style life preservers are installed on all MAF aircraft and are available for
      AECMs to use in lieu of LPU-10/P. (T-1)
   2.18.5. AFE AECM Deployment Support:
      2.18.5.1. AECMs will depart home station with all required AFE items. AFE assets will
      not be staged at stateside hubs or deployed locations. (T-1)
      2.18.5.2. Stateside locations where AECMs have stage/hub operations do not always
      have AFE support. Permanent party/host wing AFE functions at these locations will
      develop support agreements to ensure AECMs are supported. Support will include but
      not limited to equipment maintenance and security. Bases with multiple MDS and
      MAJCOMs will support this effort jointly. (T-1)
      2.18.5.3. Overseas AE operations requiring UTC 9ALAE support do not possess a
      logistics detail (LOGDET) therefore tools, testers, benchstock, and facilities may be
      limited. AFE technicians deploying for this UTC will require deployed host wing
      support. Deployed AFE Superintendents/Flight Chiefs will ensure UTC 9ALAE
      technicians and AECMs have required AFE support. (T-1)
2.19. Passenger Demonstration Kits. Lead Command—AMC. (T-1)
   2.19.1. Passenger-carrying aircraft will have a set of demonstration AFE mirroring all
   onboard individually issued passenger equipment (i.e., LPUs, EPOS, oxygen masks, etc.).

   2.19.2. To keep this equipment segregated from operational assets, store demonstration
   equipment in a “red” locally manufactured storage container. Stencil both the storage
   container and each piece of AFE "FOR DEMONSTRATION ONLY" in 1/2-inch black (or
   contrasting color) lettering. (T-1)
   2.19.3. Store the demonstration EPOS in the yellow “training” pouch. (T-1)
   2.19.4. Inspect and inventory on a 30-day cycle and as part of a Mission Termination
   Inspection (MTI). Because the items in the passenger demonstration kit are not considered
   serviceable for emergency use, the inspection and inventory consists of ensuring all the
   required items are contained within the kit, marked properly, and meet their intended
   purpose. (T-1)

                                           Chapter 3

CONFIGURATION OF AIRCRAFT INSTALLED AND PRE-POSITIONED AIRCREW
                      FLIGHT EQUIPMENT

3.1. General Aircraft Installed/Pre-positioned AFE Guidance.
   3.1.1. All items in this chapter are waiver authority T-1 unless otherwise specified.
   3.1.2. In the event installed AFE inspections come due while the aircraft is on alert status or
   away from home-station, follow guidance per TO 00-20-1.
   3.1.3. For LFA, AFE will be loaded and configured per the aircraft-specific AFI 11-2MDS
   Series Volume 3, Addenda A. If no MDS Specific Addenda A is published, units will follow
   the aircraft configuration guidance in this instruction or applicable MAJCOM or unit
   supplement to this instruction. AETC and AFMC units have unique mission requirements
   and may deviate from this instruction per guidance provided by their respective MAJCOM
   AFE Management Office. (T-1)
   3.1.4. When mission requirements dictate, Operations Group commanders (or equivalent)
   are authorized to increase aircraft equipment configurations provided the changes are in
   compliance with this instruction, applicable TOs, and allowance standard authorizations. (T-
   3).
   3.1.5. Shortages noted by the aircraft commander or designated representative and recorded
   on AFTO Form 46 or 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, are
   investigated by the AFE section. The investigating activity should request assistance in
   locating shortages from the station where the loss was discovered. (T-3).
   3.1.6. When equipment shortages are discovered which have not been documented on the
   AFTO Form 46 or 781A, the AFE section should investigate and take action IAW AFMAN
   23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. For audit purposes, document all
   investigative actions taken. (T-3).
   3.1.7. When AFE owned by other units is discovered during the inventory, notify the owning
   unit’s AFE section, citing type aircraft, tail number, and type and quantity of equipment
   found. Do not retain AFE; forward it to the owning unit by Issue Priority Designator 02
   (IPD-02). Copies of shipping documents will be forwarded to owning organizations. (T-3).
   3.1.8. LFA, AFE will be pre-positioned to the maximum extent possible at all times to
   provide mission flexibility, especially when aircraft is away from home-station, unless
   otherwise specified by 11-2MDS Specific Volume 3, Addenda A. This will reduce excessive
   handling and damage of AFE. For multi-place/large frame aircraft, prepare AFTO Form 46
   in duplicate. Maintain a file of the original and completed AFTO Forms 46 by aircraft tail
   number for all assigned aircraft for historical purposes. Purge file copies when a new AFTO
   Form 46 is produced due to equipment information changes. (T-1)
   3.1.9. LFA MTIs or post-flight inspections will be accomplished on all unit aircraft at home

   inspections are conducted after the final mission of the day or upon return to home station,
   temporary duty (TDY) locations, etc. In cases where aircraft maintenance procedures dictate

  an AFE aircraft preflight, AFE preflight actions will be the same as those used during
  MTI/post-flight inspections. However, units required to perform AFE preflight inspections
  are not required to do both an AFE preflight and MTI/post-flight. MTI/post-flight
  inspections ensure equipment accountability, serviceability, and cleanliness pre-positioned
  AFE. AFE personnel will emphasize oxygen mask cleanliness and serviceability during
  MTI/post-flight (or Preflight, if applicable) and routine 30-day mask inspections. In the
  event that equipment discrepancies are discovered, initiate appropriate actions to correct the
  deficiency prior to the next flight. If AFE is suspected of misuse, abuse or shortages exist,
  the AFEO or AFES will notify the applicable commander for corrective actions. The aircrew
  pre-flight inspection will suffice in the event aircraft/aircrew are off-station with no qualified
  AFE support to accomplish MTI/post-flights. Units will use the back of the AFTO Form 46
  or a locally developed work order (to include electronic media) to document these
  inspections. Maintain a copy of the documentation, by tail number, for a minimum of 90
  days. Note: Aircraft on alert status are exempt from MTIs until after they are removed from
  alert status. (T-1)
  3.1.10. If circumstances arise that require the removal of AFE from an aircraft at en route
  stations, the individual removing the equipment will annotate the remarks section of the
  AFTO Form 46 with their name, date equipment was removed, reason for removal, and all
  equipment disposition and destination information. That person will forward all of the
  information to the owning unit no later than 72 hours from removal. (T-3).
  3.1.11. AFE will ensure all equipment inspections remain current for the duration of the
  scheduled mission when AFE support is not deployed. Ensure aircraft AFE will have a
  minimum of 60 days remaining on its current repack and inspection when departing home-
  station for tanker task force operations, integrated tanker unit deployments (ITUD), and 30
  days for channel missions, business efforts, aircraft transfers, etc. (T-2).
  3.1.12. In the event of equipment discrepancy or a loss is discovered, and the missing AFE
  was not documented on AFTO Form 46 and AFTO Form 781A, contact the aircraft
  commander or designated aircrew representative to verify if equipment was removed during
  the mission. If AFE was removed at an en route location, contact the AFE personnel at
  location where AFE was removed to coordinate return of the equipment. (T-3).
  3.1.13. AFE will establish procedures to notify applicable agencies IAW AFMAN 23-110,
  Vol 2, Part 13, Chapter 1, in the event of loss, suspected abuse, pilferage, or mishandling of
  equipment. AFE will investigate missing equipment if not returned/located within 30 days.
  Initiate a report of survey IAW AFMAN 23-220, as required. (T-3).
  3.1.14. Proper corrective actions for off-station losses will include messages by the owning
  organization to en route locations describing lost equipment (include serial numbers for
  accountable items), TDY duration, and route of off-station aircraft. Send an information copy
  of the message to MAJCOM AFE office. Document all investigative actions taken for audit
  purposes. (T-3).
  3.1.15. AFE will transfer aircraft IAW TO 00-20-1, Preventive Maintenance Program
  General Policy Requirements and Procedures, this instruction and applicable AFI 11-2MDS-
  Series Volume 3, Addenda A. Gaining units will first contact the losing unit if an aircraft is
  transferred without the appropriate equipment. In the event the gaining and losing unit cannot

  resolve the discrepancy, the gaining unit will contact its respective MAJCOM for resolution.
  (T-1)
  3.1.16. Equipment shipped for aircraft depot retrievals will have sufficient days remaining at
  the time of shipment to ensure no impact to flight returning home. (T-1)
  3.1.17. When aircraft are permanently transferred, inspection records of installed AFE will
  be mailed or sent electronically to the gaining unit AFE section. (T-1)
  3.1.18. Due to the lack of AFE expertise at some aircraft Programmed Depot Maintenance
  (PDM) locations, maintenance and equipment accountability can be provided only by the
  organization owning the aircraft. (T-1)
  3.1.19. Upon PDM arrival of AFGSC aircraft, AFE will be shipped back to the owning unit
  where CA/CRL accountability will remain throughout the PDM duration. (T-1)
  3.1.20. In the event an aircraft transfer occurs while in PDM, both equipment custodians
  (losing and gaining) must maintain close communication among themselves and their unit
  equipment management section (EMS) to ensure the following actions are timely and
  completed accurately: (T-1)
     3.1.20.1. Sixty days prior to aircraft scheduled release from PDM, the organization
     losing the aircraft will take appropriate supply actions to ship equipment to the gaining
     base and transfer accountability. (T-1)
     3.1.20.2. The gaining base will ship equipment, using DD Form 1149, Requisition and
     Invoice/Shipping Document, to PDM for installation on aircraft. Custodians must retain
     copies of all paperwork transactions in the event equipment is lost or misplaced. (T-1)
     3.1.20.3. Upon receipt of the transfer documents, the gaining base supply EMS must
     coordinate with the AFE custodian to ensure the equipment has been received and to take
     appropriate actions to transfer CA/CRL accountability. Base supply will take no action to
     process equipment transfers until the AFE custodian verifies receipt of the equipment. (T-
     1)
  3.1.21. When aircraft are inputted for Unprogrammed Depot Maintenance (UDM), the
  owning organization will ensure equipment has a minimum of 45 days remaining on repack
  cycles prior to aircraft departure. Normally, aircraft are expected to return to the originating
  organization, but in the event aircraft are not returned to the originator, equipment custodians
  will initiate appropriate supply action to ensure equipment accountability. Transfer, receipt,
  and accountability procedures are set forth in AFMAN 23-110, and AFI 23-111,
  Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force. (T-1)
  3.1.22. Remove AFE from aircraft only for recurring inspections or as required for aircraft
  maintenance (i.e., major/minor ISOs, home-station checks (HSC), programmed depot
  maintenance (PDM), etc.) or as directed in MDS specific configuration instructions.
  Annotate AFTO Form 781A and AFTO Form 46 when AFE is removed from aircraft. (T-1)
  3.1.23. Establish local procedures to document, control, retrieve, and maintain accountability
  of all transactions IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol 4, Part 1 and AFI 23-111. Retrieve AFE issued
  temporarily on AF Form 1297 or equivalent IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 13, Chapter

   “Mobility” in the block marked “Return Date” on each AF Form 1297 for individual mobility
   equipment issued to crew members IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol 4, Part 1. (T-1)
   3.1.24. AFE sections are authorized to use a log book in place of AF Forms 1297 for items
   taken to the support agencies. Flight Chiefs will ensure the log book is current and properly
   documented to track and account for all items. (T-1)
   3.1.25. Ensure individual mobility equipment is issued, stored, and accounted for IAW
   AFMAN 23-110, Vol 4, Part 1, and AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chapter 26, Section F,
   Individual Mobility Baggage Kits. (T-1)
   3.1.26. Equipment exceeding day-to-day mission requirements,             but   required   for
   contingencies, may be placed in "serviceable storage." (T-2).
   3.1.27. Maintain equipment in serviceable storage in "ready for use” and “inspect prior to
   issue" status with time compliance technical orders (TCTO) and modifications completed.
   (T-2).
   3.1.28. Follow inspection and storage procedures for "stored equipment" established in
   applicable TOs and publications without deviation; not to exceed 12 months. Use DD Form
   1574 to identify equipment in serviceable storage. (T-2).
   3.1.29. Units will establish procedures to fit or issue AFE based on local mission
   commitments and time constraints. (T-3).
   3.1.30. When AFE has been removed or identified as being from transient aircraft,
   immediately notify the owning organization, citing type of aircraft, tail number, type and
   quantity of equipment removed, and present location. Mark assets for gaining AFE unit. Do
   not retain any AFE removed from en route aircraft. Return equipment to the owning unit
   using Shipping Priority Designator-02, as a minimum. (T-3).
   3.1.31. Marking equipment with unit identification and related information helps prevent
   loss and expedites the return of AFE to the owning organization. When assigned, record
   serial numbers and/or use local control numbers on required inspection forms to assist AFE
   in identifying accountable items. (T-3).
   3.1.32. During contingencies sanitize AFE aircrew would commonly use in an escape and
   evasion environment. AFE passenger support items such as multi-place life rafts and
   passenger LPUs do not require sanitization. (T-3).
   3.1.33. Stencil all multi-person life raft cases, accessory containers, and passenger life
   preserver cases with MAJCOM plus the unit designator of the owning unit (e.g., AMC/123
   ARS). Stencil ACC and AMC-gained Air Reserve Component (ARC) equipment with
   "ANG" or "AFRC," as appropriate, plus unit designator of the owning unit (e.g., ANG/123
   ARS). (T-2).

 NOTE:
 1. One EPOS per passenger/patient will be available regardless of planned flight altitude. EPOS
 do not have to be stationed at each seat, they may be placed throughout the cabin/cargo area so
 that any passenger/patient has quick access to oxygen regardless of where they are should loss
 of pressurization occur.
 2. One attached to the inboard seat belt mount of flight deck lower bunk and two stowed on
 parachute rack. The WC-130J weather mission does not require parachute racks. Two
 restraint harnesses will be stowed on stations.
 3. Required for overwater flights. When parachutes are carried LPU-10/P quantities will match
 parachutes. LPU-10/Ps are designed to integrate with AFE used by aircrew personnel. The
 WC-130J weather mission does not require parachutes, AERP and ABA.
 4. Four PBEs will be placed on the flight deck and two in the cargo compartment.
 5. Only required on contingency missions. The WC-130J weather mission does not require
 ABA.
 6. Any unit scheduled to conduct operations above 78 degrees north or below 60 degrees south
 (IAW federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 135, Part 135.98, Operations in the Polar Area
 and FAR Part 121, Appendix P, Requirements for ETOPS and Polar Operations) will configure
 the aircraft with a minimum of two (2) anti-exposure suits prior to mission execution.
 7. Pre-position parachutes during contingency missions with hostilities and hazardous
 functional/acceptance check flights. When carried, aircraft will have one parachute per
 crewmember. Each crewmember will wear or fit and have readily accessible for bailout. ML-4
 kits are required only for overwater flights when parachutes are carried. The WC-130J weather
 mission does not require parachutes or ML-4 kits.

NOTE:
1. Commanders may specify when additional equipment is required to meet mission needs.
Units may pre-position additional ML-4 kits, life preservers, and BA-18/22 parachutes to
prevent aircrew from having to sign out additional equipment for each flight.

MA-2 (note 13)
NOTE:
1. Three PBEs will be placed on the flight deck and two in the cargo compartment.
2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum, each
aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. Pre-position
additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads. EPOS is not required when flying local
training missions and passengers are not aboard aircraft.
3. Survival Vest are not required for local training missions if ML-4 kits are onboard the
aircraft.
4. Parachutes and survival vests are required on all missions. Exception: Refer to note 3 for
survival vests. A minimum of one parachute, vest, and anti-exposure suit per crewmember will
be prepositioned aboard the aircraft during increased scheduled crew loads. Place additional
parachutes for airdrop missions, as required.
5. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU. Preposition additional LPUs to meet increased scheduled
PAX loads. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each passenger. LPU-10/P LPUs
are a suitable substitute for the A/C LPU for passenger use until A/C
LPUs are available. If LPU-10/P LPUs are used, AC or designated aircrew representative will
ensure these LPUs are pre-fitted to passengers prior to take off.
6. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with AFE equipment and are designed for use by
aircrew personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and
must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.
7. Only required on designated overwater flights. Quantities will match quantities of parachutes
aboard aircraft.
8. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or
return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.
9. When aircraft returns from maintenance inspections, or when life rafts are not delivered with
the aircraft, local training flights may be flown provided they are not flown overwater.
Exception: Take-Off, Approach, and Landing.
10. PDK’s are not required when flying local training missions and passengers are not aboard
aircraft.
11. Item required only for PDM flights. MAJCOMs have the option of using a survival vest as a
substitute for the MSK during PDM inputs (vests are required when carrying parachutes aboard
the aircraft).
12. Infant Cots are not required when flying local training missions and passengers are not
aboard aircraft.
13. Mission/AC will dictate MA-1 or MA-2 requirement.
14. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, five LPU-10/P LPUs,
and five anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.
15. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position AFE equipment on each aircraft
IAW permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM
aircraft, will contact the losing organization’s AFE section and initiate transfer of required
aircraft-installed AFE equipment and inspection records. The gaining AFE organization will
conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any
equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft
with less than the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary

Large Frame Aircraft (LFA)—Any aircraft operating with multiple aircrew positions. These
aircraft are typically used for airlift (passenger & cargo), aerial delivery, aerial refueling,
airborne warning & control, aerial reconnaissance and long range strategic bombing. Some
examples of LFAs would include but not be limited to C-5, C-17, C-130, C-21, E-3, MC-12, KC-
10, KC-135, RC-135, etc.. Aircraft types not typically associated with LFAs would be those
more closely associated with the Fighter and RWA categories.
Logistics Detail (LOGDET)—The LOGDET defines standard passenger and equipment
movement requirements for each UTC.
Manside AFE—Any type of AFE that is worn on the body of aircrew used to enhance the
mission performance of the weapons system in the performance of their duties and/or any AFE
that is worn on the body of aircrew or passengers that sustains life during aircraft operations
and/or preserves life during aircraft mishaps.
Operational Support Crewmember—Personnel on flying status but not occupying a UMD "A"
prefix position.
Overwater Flight—Any flight taking off or landing over water, exceeding power-off glide or
auto-rotational distance from land.
Passenger (PAX)—Individual aboard aircraft for the purpose of transportation.
Pre-positioned AFE—Any type of AFE that is loaded on or in an aircraft but is not integrated
into the aircraft or it’s subsystems such as quick don oxygen masks, back style parachutes,
survival vest, aircrew body armor, etc.
