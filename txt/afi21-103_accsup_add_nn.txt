This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
It applies to all HC-130J ACC units. This Addendum applies to Air National Guard (ANG) and
Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with (IAW)
Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended
changes or comments on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to HQ

copies to the applicable OCR.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include: addition of Fuel systems and Hydraulic systems. Correcting and adding of new
Work Unit Codes (WUC) to FSL. Notes 1-69 have been revised to match Table 1.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and
subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test, or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of
Resources and Training Systems reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC) aircraft
capable of being configured for a contingency mission in accordance with Commander Air
Combat Command (COMACC) OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
     be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
     another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource the
     differences in support/mission equipment.
2. Reading the MESL(Table 1). A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work
unit code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List
(BSL) across the page. Each unit’s Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft;
therefore, it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable
to the unit’s assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would
determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement
and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and
TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL
columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.

    failed closed.
38. One may be inoperative provided: Applicable Flight Manual Limitations and Procedures are
    observed, Main Tank Transfer Pumps are operative, ECBs for inoperative Main Tank Boost
    Pump are strapped opened.
39. Although the fuel quantity indications can be displayed on multiple HDD System Status

    relevant. The “number installed” includes one indication per tank and the “number required”
    specifies the number of tanks that must have an operative indication.
40. One is required for in-flight refueling missions. May be inoperative provided valve is
    electrically disconnected and secured OPEN.

41. Maybe inoperative unless required to accomplish mission objectives.
42. Must have at least one fully operational. All stall warning system aural and visual warnings
    must be functional.
43. One required for normal airspace; both must be operational for missions in RVSM airspace.
44. If both autopilots are inoperative, consideration is given to reduce crew duty day. One needs
    to be operational in RVSM airspace.
45. May be inoperative provided, UHF #1 or VHF #1 is operational and at least one additional
    UHF or VHF radio is operational.
46. May be inoperative provided that one operative unit is available for each primary crew
    member. Public address may be inoperative as long as effective communications may be
    conducted by the crew.
47. IFF mode C, S required for flight. Mode 4 maybe inoperative for all CONUS flights. Unless
    directed by mission.
48. May be inoperative if deactivated and secured and is not required for compliance with ATC
    requirements. Passengers will not be carried.
49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) Beacon may be inoperative provided flight profile does not
    include extended overwater segments.
50. One VHF and one UHF secure voice system maybe inoperative.
51. Only voice SATCOM required
52. Required if thunderstorms or hazardous conditions that can be detected by airborne radar
    are forecast or exist along the route of flight, or essential to accomplish mission objectives.
53. One may be inoperative provided flight through airspace with no Nav-aids will not be
    conducted. Consult FLIP for airspace restrictions. EGI data input to special mission
    equipment may be inoperative for mission execution, if functions can be accomplished
    manually.
54. AAR-47 Missile Warning, AN/ALE-47 Flare and Chaff dispensing, AN/ALR-56M Radar
    Warning system must be operational as required for mission profile.
55. BAU's 1, 2, 4, and 5 must be operational. BAU 3 (day time only) and/or 6 will be used as
    replacements or can be failed (swap modules).
56. All busses required except the Electronic Warfare Bus, unless required for mission
    accomplishment.
57. Required for deployed aircraft only
58. HDD #1-#4, all data fields and displays must be operative for the associated HDD to be
    considered operative. However, when an input is not present and the correct “data not
    available or fail” indication (which may be a blank or removal of the indication) is
    displayed, the affected HDD may still be considered operative provided the failed indication
    is not required for the current mission. HDD #5-#8, may be inoperative unless essential for
    accomplishment of mission objectives.
59. One HUD may be inoperative providing both HDD's on the same effected side are
    operational. Both may be inoperative provided: (1) HDDs #1-4 are operative (including
    operative independent PFDs in the Pilot and Copilot positions), (2) Forecast weather at

     destination is at or above category 1 approach minimums.
60. CNI-MU at CSO position may be inoperative on flights not requiring a CSO. One CNI-SP
     may be inoperative for onetime flight to repair facility.
61. Must have one fully operational.
62. May inoperative unless essential for performance of mission, route, or Air Traffic Control
     Requirements.
63. All components of the #1 VHF/ILS navigation system must be operational.
64. One time flight authorized to repair facility, including en-route stops. One operational
     regulator required at each primary crew station.
65. For extended overwater operations, sufficient life rafts must be available to accommodate all
    persons on board. Two life rafts required for normal operations.
66. May be inoperative provided control is available through the associated soft panel.
67. One time flight authorized to repair facility, including en-route stops.
68. Both may be inoperative. Unless required by mission.
69. One may be inoperative provided CAT II ILS approaches will not be flown.
