Developing airlift requests can at times seem to be a rather complex task. There are numerous
areas that must be addressed, any one of which can cause the approval of the request to be
delayed. This information is provided to assist you in both planning your airlift requirements
and preparing your actual requests. If you have any suggestions for changes, additions,
deletions, etc. for this pamphlet, please submit to HQ PACAF/A4RDC at any time.

More detailed information on airlift requests is provided in Defense Transportation Regulation
(DTR) 4500.9R. Airlift requests are to be submitted via Special Assignment Airlift Mission
(SAAM) Request System (SRS). This pamphlet is for Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) use and does
not take precedent over the DOD 4500 series, the Joint Federal Travel Regulations, or the
Foreign Clearance Guide.

1. Responsibilities: Airlift must be requested through the following channels. (See Figure 1.1)
PACAFPAM24-1 17 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   3


Figure 1.1. SAAM Validation Flow Diagram.




   1.1. UNIT: The unit is required to accomplish the basic special assignment airlift mission
   (SAAM) request using the DD Form 1249, Airlift Request – SAAM or JCS Exercise format
   and an aircraft load plan. As the requesting unit, they have the best information on load data,
   hazardous materials requiring lift, and dimensional data to match the aircraft request to the
   actual load. Units will also accomplish a diplomatic clearance worksheet for all hazardous
   materials associated with the movement and forward to the base validator. The unit must
   establish and maintain close contact with the base Logistics Readiness Traffic Management
   Flight Small Terminal Operations Section and Logistics Plans flights for planned data, time
   frames and aircraft configurations. A completed DD form 1249 must be submitted to the base
   Logistics Readiness Traffic Management Flight Small Terminal Operations Section NLT 60
   days prior to movement date. This suspense is required to ensure the SAAM request is
   submitted to TRANSCOM NLT 30 days prior to movement date, resulting in a 10 percent
   rebate on airlift costs.
   1.2. BASE PLANS: The installation deployment officer and unit deployment managers are
   involved in the planning and execution of cargo and passenger movement for their respective
   base. All airlift requests must be coordinated through Base Plans if not already initiated by
   that organization to ensure the intent of AFI 10-403, Section 2E, Paragraph 2.29.1 is met.
 4                                                    PACAFPAM24-1 17 DECEMBER 2010


     1.3. BASE VALIDATOR: Usually this will be the Logistics Readiness/LGRDA function.
     LGRDA will check the DD Form 1249 for accuracy, compare load data and hazardous cargo
     information against the submitted load plan, and validate the aircraft type requested to the
     load data and travel distances. The base validator will then submit the request to HQ
     PACAF/A4RDC for validation via the SAAM Request System (SRS). Base validators will
     submit a load plan for every movement requirement and a diplomatic clearance worksheet
     for all hazardous materials associated with the movement to the MAJCOM Validator
     mailbox      identified   in   the    global    as     SAAM        Validator    PACAF/A4
     (saamvalidatorpacaf.a4@hickam.af.mil). You may fax or email the manual DD Form
     1249, SAAM or JCS Exercise – Airlift Request, when SRS is unable to be used. HQ PACAF
     must receive the request NLT 45 days prior to movement date. Late submission can
     jeopardize the 10% rebate.
     1.4. MAJCOM VALIDATOR: HQ PACAF validators will check the submitted Airlift
     request for accuracy, assign a SAAM number, JCS priority, and ensure a fund cite is
     annotated on the request. Any discrepancies will be referred back to the Small Terminal
     Operations Section for correction. HQ PACAF/A4RDC will forward the request to the 613 th
     Air Operations Center or the Regional Certification Official (RCO) to continue the approval
     process.
     1.5. 613th AOC/AMD: Will accept SAAM requests from PACAF validators for execution.
     Will accept approved SAAM requests from 618th TACC for execution for theater assigned
     aircraft.
     1.6. Regional Certification Official (RCO): The RCO function block provides Combatant
     Commanders (CCDRs) the opportunity to certify all SAAMs terminating in their theater.
     RCOs will review submitted SRS requests for onward movement planning and prioritization.
     After review, the RCO will forward SAAM requests to USTRANSCOM for final approval.
     1.7. USTRANSCOM: Will accept submitted SRS requests and review for approval. Once
     validated, requests will be forwarded to 618th TACC (SAAM Shop) for airlift assignment.
     1.8. 618th TACC (SAAM Shop) : Will accept approved SRS requests, assign airlift and bill
     the funding agency.
2. Submitting SAAM Airlift Requests: All airlift requests must be submitted in SRS using the
proper format IAW DTR 4500.9R Part 2, Appendix Q. Validators may fax or email the manual
DD Form 1249, SAAM or JCS Exercise – Airlift Request, when SRS is unable to be used.
Unclassified SAAM requests will follow the path outlined in Figure 1 unless disapproved,
unsupported,    or  canceled.         SRS   website    (Subset     of  CAMPS       system):

gin.aspx
     2.1. CHANGES: Submit changes to SAAM request via SRS by creating a revision to the
     original request. If a SAAM number has been assigned to the original request, notify the
     MAJCOM validator prior to making any changes in SRS. PACAF/A4RDC has created a
     SAAM Validator mailbox for coordination of all SAAM requests in addition to the SRS
     system. Please utilize this email (saamvalidatorpacaf.a4@hickam.af.mil) address for
     correspondence relating to SAAM coordination which is identified as ―SAAM Validator
     PACAF/A4‖ on the global email listing.
PACAFPAM24-1 17 DECEMBER 2010                                                                 5


   2.2. PRICING: A 10% discount is allocated if USTRANSCOM receives a SAAM request
   no later than 30 days prior to execution date. Do not assume the request has been received
   by USTRANSCOM, verify this through your Base/MAJCOM validator. Significant changes
   to the SAAM request within the 30 day window will negate the 10% discount.
       2.2.1. MINIMUM ACTIVITY RATES (MAR): Please note the MAR for the C-17 is
       4 HOURS, not 2 hours as with all other AMC aircraft.
       2.2.2. SAAM Rates: Please see fiscal year airlift rate guidance published by HQ AMC/
       FMAT (Financial Management & Comptroller) for further clarification of charges. Air
       Force Portal weblink for HQ AMC/FMAT: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

       mmand=addContext.
       2.2.3. AMC Commercial Cancellation Penalty: Typical charges that could be incurred
       by the user pending cancellation of contracted commercial airlift are contained in figure
       2. Rates may vary and are subject to the terms and conditions of the AMC commercial
       contract.

4.4.2. NOTES:
           4.4.2.1. * Maximum payload is computed without regard to cargo density. It is
           limited only by aircraft structural limitations or critical leg fuel (OEM) and is shown
           primarily for information. It includes weight of any passengers carried. It should not
           be used unless cargo density is known to be high and physical characteristics of cargo
           would permit full use of the compartment space. Flight route segments less than
           critical leg distances may allow for more or less ACL depending on wind factors.
           4.4.2.2. ** Maximum heights are as follows: 102 inches for large, single items of
           cargo placed on pallets. 100 inches for palletized, netted cargo connected. 100

         floor is limited to 105 5/8 inches wide. Maximum height for other-than-palletized
         cargo located on the aircraft is restricted to 80 inches.
         4.4.2.3. *** Includes weight of cargo, pallet, and nets. Maximum weight on aircraft
         ramp is 5,000 lbs, including weight of aircraft dual rails and rollers.
         4.4.2.4. **** Maximum height allowed. An 18-inch aisle must be provided on the
         left-hand side of pallets positioned in pallet position 6. A minimum of 6-inch aisle
         must be provided on the left-hand side of pallets positioned in the wheel well area
         (pallet positions 3,4).
         4.4.2.5. (+) Any passenger load requires a minimum of one loadmaster in cargo
         compartment; two if more than 40 passengers are carried.
         4.4.2.6. (+) Width of cargo affects use of sidewall seats. If vehicle exceeds 76 inches
         wide, seats will be available only on one side of aircraft if wide cargo can be loaded
         off-center to right side of aircraft. Cargo widths over 96-inches, no passenger seats
         are available beside the cargo.

         strapped/netted cargo.
         4.4.2.8. (+) Aisleways: Pallet Positions three and four (Wheel Well). A minimum 6-
         inch safety aisle must be provided on the left-hand side of pallets positioned in the
         wheel well area. Pallet Position six (Ramp). To allow for the use of the toilet facility,
         an 18 X 18-inch cut-out must be provided on the forward, left corner of pallets loaded
         on the ramp. Also, a 6-inch safety aisle must be provided aft of the toilet facility.
         NOTE: Certain aircraft models have the toilet facility located on the right side of
         aircraft. If possible, coordinate with mobility force personnel to determine which
         model will be used. When this information cannot be obtained, recommend an 18-
         inch aisle along entire length of ramp pallet. This will enable pallet to be rotated to
         meet the requirement for the toilet facility and safety aisle.
  4.5. C-17 GLOBEMASTER III: The C-17 Globemaster aircraft was designed and built by
  Boeing (formerly McDonnell-Douglas Corporation). Its primary mission is global airlift of
  large outsized items of cargo to small austere airfields at or near the battle area, by aerial
  delivery or airland methods. The C-17 provides increased speed and payload capabilities
  over the C-130 and offers potentially unlimited range with air-to-air refueling. The C-17 can
  be configured to support the following: rolling stock, logistics pallets, equipment/paratroop
  airdrop, passenger/troops, and litter/ambulatory aeromedical patients. Should mission dictate
  reconfiguration, onboard aircraft equipment will accommodate any combination of the above
  configurations.

  4.7. KC-10A EXTENDER: The KC-10A Extender is a global strategic aircraft designed by
  the McDonnell-Douglas Company with a dual-purpose mission. This aircraft functions as an
  aerial refueler and cargo/passenger aircraft. The KC-10 is a commercially designed aircraft
  and is comparable to the Douglas DC-10 passenger aircraft. KC-10 operations primarily
  support the Air Combat Command (ACC) during refueling missions and the Air Mobility
  Command (AMC) for cargo missions. Cargo is carried on the upper deck of the KC-10 and
  fuel tanks are contained in the lower compartments of the fuselage. The KC-10 vastly

4.7.2. NOTES:
          4.7.2.1. * Maximum payload is computed without regard to cargo density, is limited
          only by aircraft structural limitations or critical leg fuel (4000NM), and is shown
          primarily for information. It includes weight of any passengers carried and should
          not be used unless cargo density is known to be high and physical characteristics of
          the cargo would permit full use of compartment space. Flight route segments less
          than critical leg distances may allow for more or less ACL depending on wind
          factors. Fuel offload requirements for aerial refueling missions may reduce cargo
          ACL allowable.
          4.7.2.2. ** Cargo door height limits all cargo to 96 inches above surface of pallet.
          Cargo compartment curvature restricts normal pallet building techniques.
          4.7.2.3. *** Includes weight of cargo, pallet, and nets or other tie-down equipment.
          The KC-10 does NOT have a floor loading capability. All cargo/baggage must be

         palletized or placed on a pallet subfloor. Until further notice, pallet position 13 will
         not be offered for user cargo space. Space is required for aircraft ground servicing
         (crew chief) equipment.
         4.7.2.4. **** Maximum axle weights are predicated on a minimum separation of 48
         inches.
         4.7.2.5. ***** At 100 inches above the floor level, the compartment width is
         approximately 144 inches. Due to the curvature of the fuselage, the cargo
         compartment area forward and aft of the constant section diminishes in height and
         width.
         4.7.2.6. (+) Baggage must be palletized and considered as cargo. Hand-carried item
         must be fit under the seats. Troops will be allowed to hand carry their weapons and
         helmets. Other items that will not fit under the seats must be palletized, i.e.,
         rucksacks, web belts, crew served weapons, etc.
         4.7.2.7. (+) External high reach stairs are required for all passenger
         loading/downloading. Upon user request, wide-body stair extenders may be brought
         in with the aircraft to be used with stands that reach 12 feet in height or higher.
         4.7.2.8. (+) Due to limited galley facilities, hot meal service should be limited to not
         more than 20 passengers. Box meals are recommended for all troop/passenger
         missions where meals are required. i.e. When submitting an airlift request under
         Material Handling Support, the request must include a wide-body loader, stair case
         extended, or wide-body staircase when needed.
         4.7.2.9. (-) All KC-10s will have 125 straps, 150 chains, and 10 sets of pallet
         couplers.
         4.7.2.10. (+) The Code D configuration has a four pallet seat kit installed over pallet
         positions 2-4, left and right sides.
         4.7.2.11. (-) (+) Aircraft tow bar is required when aircraft will operate into/out of
         airfields where like tow bars are not available.
  4.8. KC-135 STRATOTANKER: The KC-135 Stratotanker's principal mission is air
  refueling. This asset greatly enhances the U. S. Air Force's capability to accomplish its
  mission of Global Engagement. It also provides aerial refueling support to U.S. Navy, U.S.
  Marine Corps and allied aircraft. Four turbofans, mounted under 35-degree swept wings,
  power the KC-135 to takeoffs at gross weights up to 322,500 pounds (146,285 kilograms).
  Nearly all internal fuel can be pumped through the tanker's flying boom, the KC-135's
  primary fuel transfer method. A special shuttlecock-shaped drogue, attached to and trailed
  behind the flying boom, may be used to refuel aircraft fitted with probes. An operator
  stationed in the rear of the plane controls the boom. A cargo deck above the refueling system
  can hold a mixed load of passengers and cargo. Depending on fuel storage configuration, the
  KC-135 can carry up to 83,000 pounds (37,648 kilograms) of cargo.

      designed primarily to satisfy the information needs of senior-level decision-makers in
      conducting joint planning and operations. JOPES is intended to be used to monitor, plan,
      and execute mobilization, deployment, employment, and sustainment activities. JOPES
      applications span peacetime and wartime. USTRANSCOM requires JOPES use for
      peacetime, contingency, and war operations. Contact your local Logistics Planning
      Branch for more details.
      4.9.5. SINGLE MOBILITY SYSTEM (SMS): SMS is a web-based computer system
      that provides visibility of air, sea, and land transportation assets and provides aggregated
      reporting of cargo and passenger movements. SMS does this by collecting plane, ship,
      and truck movement data from other computer systems such as GTN, CAMPS, GDSS,
      JALIS, DTTS, and ANGMU. SMS is unclassified. To obtain a SMS USERID/password,
