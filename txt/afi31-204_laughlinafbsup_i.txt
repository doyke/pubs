                                             Chapter 2

                                    DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
     2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a
     privilege granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must
     comply with the laws and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on
     the installation. Consequently, everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation
     must produce, upon request from the security police, the following:
        2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
        2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license
        and/or AF Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card,
        supported by a DD Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine
        acceptable identification media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each
        installation commander must determine if international drivers licenses are recognized
        and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdiction, and if so, will their use be authorized on
        the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS civilian jurisdictions will honor use of
        international drivers licenses for short periods of time by non-resident visitors and
        assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders should assimilate
        local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
        2.1.1.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) International driver’s licenses are authorized for use on
        Laughlin AFB for thirty days after arrival. Mexican driver’s licenses are recognized and
        accepted at Laughlin AFB except when the driver is a resident of the United States. In
        this case, individuals have thirty days to procure a valid state driver’s license.
        2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of
        motor vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety
        inspection, or other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement.
        Note: In some instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is
        registered may require, as a condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state
        or jurisdiction, a safety or other inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another
        state or jurisdiction. Though not enforceable (in another state), failure to comply may
        invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/operator in a precarious legal
        position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to comply with their "home
        state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state requirements.
        Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/or
        registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
        2.1.1.3. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Any vehicle operated on Laughlin AFB is required to have
        insurance coverage that meets or exceeds the minimum coverage mandated by the state
        of Texas.
        2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the
        installation commander.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                       9


   2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the
   installation commander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor
   vehicles:
       2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off
       base as determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
       2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command
       instructions, and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop,
       inspection, search, and impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry
       gates and in Air Force restricted areas.
       2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted
       areas) of POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to
       enforce a traffic regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
   2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their
   installation commanders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and
   impoundment of vehicles. This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass
   appropriate legal review. Note: A theater commander or those commanding unified forces
   may direct policy covering all installations under their command. In this case, MAJCOMs
   must review those policies before issuing their guidance.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential
tests for alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to
accepting installation driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained,
apprehended, or cited for any impaired driving offense committed while driving or in physical
control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force installation.
2.3. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Any person subject to this instruction who operates or is in actual
physical control of a motor vehicle on Laughlin AFB shall be deemed to have given their
consent to a chemical test of their blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances for the
purpose of determining the alcohol/drug content if cited or lawfully apprehended for any
offense allegedly committed while driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle
and suspected of being under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. Failure to submit
to or complete the blood, breath or urine test will result in an automatic 1-year revocation of
driving privileges.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment
of their POV if their POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with
traffic operations; 3) Creates a safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left
unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned.
Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or contractor for the cost of towing,
storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their motor vehicle because of a
situation described above.
   2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction,
   the definitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to
   enforcement action under paragraph 2.4 Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and
   definitions into the local installation traffic code and make them known to the general public.
 10                                   AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


   2.4.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Vehicles parked illegally for more than 24 hours will be
   impounded. Vehicles that interfere with traffic operations, create a safety hazard, disabled by
   accident or incident, or left unattended in or adjacent to a restricted, controlled, or off-limits
   area will be impounded after attempts to locate the owner have failed. Oversized vehicles
   and trailers parked in unauthorized areas will be towed immediately. Refer to Chapter 6 of
   this supplement for further guidance on impoundment procedures.
2.4. (LAUGHLIN AFB) As a condition to registering a vehicle (AF Form 75,
Vehicle/Visitor Pass), personnel give their consent to the impoundment of their vehicles
under the following conditions.
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. Installation commanders may suspend
or revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and
unrelated to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must
incorporate procedures governing suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement
to this instruction. Make these known to the general public.
   2.5.1. Suspensions.
   2.5.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Suspension of driving privileges occurs when driving privileges
   are removed for a short period of time (i.e., receipt of excessive parking tickets, preliminary
   driving suspension letter) or may also be used to remove driving privileges while pending
   final resolution in an intoxicated driving incident. When a violator commits an offense as
   identified in Table 2.1 below and Table 5.1, their driving privileges will be suspended for the
   period specified. Whether a suspension or a revocation, the violator’s commander will
   ensure the sanctions outlined in this supplement are imposed. The following offenses will
   result in suspension/revocation of driving privileges by 47 MSG/CC:

Table 2.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Suspension of Driving Privileges.
                                                            FIRST        SECOND          THIRD

       2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or
       when lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also
       suspend or revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation
       parking standards, or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                       11


     nature. Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation policy for non-
     moving violations, as well as what constitutes a non-moving violation on their
     installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to register; unauthorized
     modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make these
     standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
     known to the general public.
     2.5.1.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Personnel who fail to maintain automobile insurance will
     have driving privileges suspended for six months and have base registration terminated.
     Upon receipt of a ticket and LAFB temporary suspension letter issued for driving without
     insurance or proof of insurance, the First Sergeants, commanders, or civilian supervisors
     will determine if the violator had insurance on the date the ticket was issued. They
     indicate their findings on the reverse side of the ticket and return it to 47 SFS/S5R. Upon
     return of tickets indicating violators did not have insurance, 47 SFS/S5R will initiate
     driving suspension actions. Personnel may have driving privileges suspended for
     consistently violating installation traffic rules. For a list of LAFB traffic rules refer to
     Attachment 4 of this Supplement.
     2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw
     anyone's authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the
     installation.
     2.5.1.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Individuals with suspended or revoked driving privileges
     are not authorized to drive on base at any time without approved limited driving
     privileges granted by 47 MSG/CC. NOTE: Personnel with suspended or revoked base
     driving privileges, and a valid state license, as well as valid vehicle insurance may park in
     the designated long-term temporary base parking area located in front of the Base Horse
     Stables. This parking area, when applicable, will be specifically defined in the
     individual's final suspension/revocation letter.
        2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV
        driving privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which
        involves active duty military personnel, their family members, retired members of the
        military service, and DoD civilian personnel. This applies regardless of the
        geographic location of an intoxicated driving incident. Installation commanders can
        only suspend privileges of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents occurring on the
        installation or in the areas subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a review
        of available evidence as specified in paragraph 2.6, suspend driver’s privileges
        pending resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances
        outlined below:
     2.5.1.3. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Personnel who knowingly lend a motor vehicle to a driver
     whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended, will have their driving
     privileges suspended for 3 months if the driver is apprehended or detained for driving on
     the installation. Suspension of installation driving privileges of up to 3 months may be
     considered for allowing an individual to operate a motor vehicle on base without a valid
     motor vehicle license.

           drugs.
           2.5.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.10 percent by volume
           or higher.
           2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood
           alcohol by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a
           suspension for a BAC or BrAC level below 0.10.
           2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an
           intoxicated driving incident occurred.
       2.5.1.4. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) When an individual is suspected of driving while
       intoxicated (DWI) or driving under the influence (DUI), the SF Controller will notify 47
       FTW/JA. After coordination with 47 FTW/JA the SF Controller will request approval by
       the base magistrate (47 MSG/CC or 47 MSG/CD) to issue a pre-signed LAFB Temporary
       Suspension of Driving Privileges letter to the offender. The letter and case file will be
       forwarded to 47 SFS/S5R. The temporary suspension letter will immediately take effect
       and continue until the official letter of revocation or termination of suspension is received
       from 47 MSG/CC or 47 MSG/CD. Active duty personnel/civilian employee notices will
       be handled IAW AFI 31-204, paragraph 2.7.2.2. The unit commander, or equivalent, will
       present the sponsor of active duty personnel/ civilian employee family members with
       their notice.
   2.5.2. Revocation.
   2.5.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) When a violator accumulates points or commits an offense as
   identified in Table 2.2 below and Table 5.1, their driving privileges are revoked for the
   period specified. The installation magistrate will revoke driving privileges for the following
   offenses:

Note 1. (Added) Refusal to submit/complete BAC testing, receipt of commander's action for on-
base incidents, or receipt of official documentation for off-base incidents will result in revocation
of driving privileges.

Note 2. (Added) DUI related factors can include, but are not limited to, driving behavior,
patrolman observation, and Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) performance.
       2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a
       period of not less than one year in the following circumstances:
               2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to
               submit to or complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required
               by the law of the jurisdiction, installation traffic code, or this instruction.
           2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian
           administrative action resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for

           revocation action.
           2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the
           installation commander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is
           required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military
           personnel.
       2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and
       driving records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when
       receiving similar records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
       2.5.2.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) 47 SFS/S5R forwards revocation, suspension, and driving
       records to gaining commanders at the end of each month. When receiving similar
       records for inbound personnel, the records are entered into the Security Forces
       Management Information System (SFMIS) by 47 SFS/S5R and forwarded to the 47
       MSG/CC for action. Personnel will be notified in writing they will remain under
       suspension or revocation for at least the original specified period.
       2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the
       revocation period from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during
       which full driving privileges were restored pending resolution of charges.
       2.5.2.3. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Personnel who had limited driving privileges granted by
       the installation commander must have a copy of an immediate granting memorandum
       available when operating a motor vehicle on base.
       2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively
       or concurrently.

   of preliminary suspension of driving privileges to personnel assigned to, employed, or
   visiting Laughlin AFB who have been apprehended or charged for operating a motor vehicle
   under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
       2.5.4.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) The on-duty Flight Chief will ensure a preliminary
       suspension memorandum is issued to personnel apprehended or charged for DUI/DWI on
       the installation. The on-duty Flight Chief will also ensure notifications are made to 47
       MSG/CC and 47 FTW/JA prior to issuance of the suspension of driving privileges letter.
       2.5.4.2. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) 47 SFS/S5R will issue preliminary suspension
       memorandums to those personnel apprehended for DUI/DWI off base upon receiving a
       civil arrest report or other official documentation.
   2.5.5. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Record of driving records. 47 SFS/S5R will process
   revocation, suspension, and driving records for personnel arriving and departing Laughlin
   AFB. 47 MSS/DPMAR, outbound assignments section, will forward copies of PCS,
   separation, and retirement orders to 47 SFS/S5R for this purpose.
2.5. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Unit commanders (or equivalent) may request suspension of
installation driving privileges for individuals under their control. Written requests are
forwarded to 47 MSG/CC, through the 47th Security Forces Squadron Reports and Analysis
Section (47 SFS/S5R). 47 SFS/S5R will prepare the suspension letter and forward the complete
case file to 47 MSG/CC through 47th Flying Training Wing Staff Judge Advocate (47 FTW/JA)
for final determination. The 47 FTW/CC will make this decision, if the magistrates are
unavailable.
2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
   2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation
   commanders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect
   during reassignment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before
   reassignment. Installation commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by
   case basis. Anyone with suspended or revocated privileges may petition an installation
   commander for partial or limited driving privileges.
   2.6.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Anyone with suspended or revoked privileges may petition 47
   MSG/CC for partial or limited driving privileges by submitting their requests to 47 SFS/S5R.
       2.6.1.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Any individual who PCS’s to Laughlin AFB with
       a suspension and/or revocation from another installation due to a DUI/DWI and has an
       equivalent DUI/DWI Alcoholic Education Program Course from that state/country will
       be honored. Additionally, personnel must provide documentation showing they received
       Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program and Treatment (ADAPT). After proof is provided,
       personnel must request reinstatement, in writing, through their commander (or
       equivalent), to 47 SFS/S5R, 47 SFS/CC, 47 FTW/JA, and 47 MSG/CC. After 47
       MSG/CC’s determination, the request is returned to 47 SFS/S5R, who will advise the
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                         15


      individual of the decision. If reinstatement is granted, 47 SFS/S5R will type or stamp
      ―REINSTATED‖ on the individual’s revocation paperwork and removes them from the
      revocation roster.
2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that
   person in writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate
   this notice with the base legal office.
   2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3 and 2.5.2.1, do not suspend or revoke a
   person's driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered
   an administrative hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or
   revocation takes effect once making or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual
   circumstances should you make verbal notifications. Unless an application for a hearing is
   made within the prescribed period, suspension or revocation takes place on the prescribed
   date and time. Installation commanders determine the time period for staying a suspension
   or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hearing. For offenses
   outlined in para 2.5.1.3 and 2.5.2.1, an installation commander will authorize an immediate
   preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
   statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete
   chemical testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
   2.7.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Incidents involving driving drunk or impaired, or refusal to
   submit to Implied Consent Policy will result in immediate suspension or revocation. Unless
   an application for a hearing is made within 10 duty days, suspension or revocation takes
   place on the prescribed date and time. 47 MSG/CC will determine the time period for a
   suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for an administrative hearing. For
   offenses listed above in tables 2.1, 2.2, and Table 5.1, 47 MSG/CC will authorize an
   immediate suspension based on reliable evidence. Requests for administrative hearings
   involving Active Duty personnel, DoD personnel and dependants will be routed through 47
   SFS/CC. Requests involving all others are routed through 47 SFS/S5R only. Requesting an
   administrative hearing must be in writing and addressed to 47 SFS/S5R, 355 Colorado Ave,
   Laughlin AFB TX 78843-5207. Request will be coordinated through 47 SFS/S5R to 47
   MSG/CC, through 47 SFS/CC and then through 47 FTW/JA. Upon completion of the
   hearing, 47 MSG/CC will annotate paperwork to indicate the decision and return the case file
   to 47 SFS/S5R. The 47 FTW/CC will fulfill this duty if the magistrates are not available.
   Reinstatement from suspensions/revocation is automatic only for personnel who have had
   their base driving privileges suspended/revoked for 6 months or less. Personnel who are
   suspended for driving offenses other than drugs/alcohol must complete the 47th Flying
   Training Wing Safety (47 FTW/SE) Course V, Remedial Driver’s Training Course or an
   equivalent civilian course. After completing the required remedial training, personnel must
   provide proof of completion to 47 SFS/S5R. After completing the required period for a
   ―Drug and/or Alcohol‖ revocation, personnel must report to 47 SFS/S5R with proof of
   completion of Texas Department of Public Safety Driving While Intoxicated (DUI/DWI)
   Alcohol Education Program. The 63rd Judicial District Community Justice Assistance
   Division located on 200 Griner St., Del Rio, Texas administers the program. Should 47
   MSG/CC determine the offense does not warrant a suspension or revocation, it will be
16                                  AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


  rescinded except in instances where suspension or revocation was issued due to refusal to
  complete chemical testing.
     2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as
     soon as possible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
     2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary
     suspension for intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-
     installation, non-DoD affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary
     suspension for intoxicated driving either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the
     person is employed on the installation, send the notice to their commander or reasonable
     equivalent.
     2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification
     for intoxicated driving:
         2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph
         2.5.2 of this AFI.
         2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation
         or resolution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or
         designee).
         2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be
         represented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel.
         Commanders determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel
         requests.
         2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative
         present at the administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and
         instructions.
         2.7.2.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the
         administrative hearing before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes
         permanent.
         2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed
         letter to the address shown in the letter.
         2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is
         determined by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated
         driving remains in effect until the installation commander makes a final decision.
         However, if no decision is made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or
         revocation, restore full driving privileges until the accused is notified of the final
         hearing results.
         2.7.2.3.7. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Individuals whose driving privileges are suspended
         or revoked have the right to request, in writing, a hearing before 47 MSG/CC. The
         request for a hearing must be submitted to 47 SFS/S5R within 10 calendar days of
         receiving the suspension/ revocation letter for processing.
  2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1)
  The law enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                          17


   was in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other
   drugs; 2) The person was lawfully cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3)
   The person was asked to submit to a test for alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or

   test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of allowed blood alcohol
   content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation apprehension or in
   violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing methods used
   were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
       2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1 for intoxicated driving, the
       revocation is mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
           2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the
           effective date of the revocation.
           2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension
           letter, or send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written
           notice, or the showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
           2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously
           granted. Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration
           of all or partial driving privileges.
2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
   2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle
   incident to Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.
2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding
determines lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not
amounting to intoxicated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
   2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
   2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in

   2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication,
   installation commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose
   authority to drive on military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service
   authority. Ensure the individual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host
   nation, etc.) are still valid.
 18                                   AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


   2.10.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Unless prohibited by higher authority, or other publication, 47
   MSG/CC may authorize limited driving privileges to those whose authority to drive has been
   suspended or revoked. NOTE: A letter is sent to the state issuing the individuals civilian
   license in accordance with AFMAN 31-201, Volume 7, Security Forces Administration and
   Reports. If the state revokes the individual's license on a reciprocal basis, the limited driving
   privileges cannot be granted. If limited privileges have already been granted, upon
   notification of the state revocation the limited privileges will be terminated and the individual
   must return the limited driving privileges memorandum to 47 SFS/S5R.
   2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or
   reinstatement to any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation
   by a state, federal, or host nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and
   for on base privileges only), coordinate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This
   option applies only to installations exercising exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline
   procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges in the base supplement to this AFI
   or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in which there is extreme
   hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the granting of
   limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is the
   more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential
   liability inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or
   other license is allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative
   separation may be appropriate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone
   ineffective and incapable of performing their military duties, and a change in duty position is
   not reasonable.
   2.10.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Requests for limited driving privileges must be made in
   writing through the unit commander for concurrence or non-concurrence. All requests,
   regardless of concurrence or non-concurrence at the unit level, will be submitted to 47
   SFS/S5R for presentation to 47 MSG/CC. The request must describe, in detail, the hardship
   created and the exact driving privileges requested (see example at Attachment 5). A copy of
   the approved request must be kept in the person’s possession when operating or in physical
   control of a vehicle and presented to SFS upon request. It is the responsibility of the violator
   whose driving privileges are revoked to maintain a copy of the approved limited privileges
   memorandum. Failure to have this document will result in detainment until the matter is
   resolved, and/or apprehension if the document cannot be produced.
2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is
   discovered driving in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or
   installation commander may also take administrative or disciplinary action.
   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the
   offender completes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or
   other program deemed necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.
2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal
   suspension and revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                    19


  honor the reciprocal agreements with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On
  receipt of written notice, the receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if
  the violations or incidents occurred within its own jurisdiction.
     2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal
     military reciprocity:
         2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically
         terminate the individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only
         comparable military administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point
         assessment) for those off-base violations reported by local, state, or host nation
         authorities.
         2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license
         is issued when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one
         year or more only) following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or
         for refusal to submit to a BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the
         revocation and the BAC/BrAC level.
  2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the
  host nation concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation
  commanders. When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an
  agreement concerning reciprocity exists, the installation commander must have prior
  authorization to negotiate and conclude such an international agreement in accordance with
  applicable directives.

                            TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision.
   A strong traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision,
   and control of motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws
   and regulations together with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle
   accidents are also important. Finally, every successful program must include meaningful
   interaction, education, and communication with the general public.
      4.1.1.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) The Installation Traffic Supervision Committee
      (ITSC) will be chaired by 47 MSG/CD. The following agencies select representatives to
      participate in the committee: 47 FTW/JA, 47 FTW/SE, 47 SFS/CC, 47 ISS (P)/CC. The
      installation traffic engineer serves as the recorder for items covered by the committee.
   4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest
   and most efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic
   planning is circulation control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other
   concerned staff agencies develop the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway
   engineering representatives from adjacent civilian communities to ensure the installation plan
   is compatible with plans developed by the state and surrounding local communities. As a
   minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include
      measures for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated
      traffic directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic
      engineer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan.
      This is normally a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position
      should have an infrastructure planning and engineering background.
      4.1.2.8. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) The Civil Engineer Asset Optimization Section
      will maintain the Laughlin AFB Traffic Circulation Plan.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow
   patterns, and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated
   traffic control studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor
   routes, locations for traffic control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or
   enforcement services.

   4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency
   (MTMCTEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering
   problems. MTMCTEA traffic engineering team services include:
       4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
       4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
       4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.
   4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance
   with AFR 75-88, Highways for National Defense.
4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
   4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles
   on the installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent
   military authority is empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements.
   Installation traffic codes must contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree
   possible, conform to the code of the state or host nation in which the installation is located.
   The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code and for ensuring it meets all local and
   legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the following:
   4.2.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Installation traffic codes are listed in Attachment 4 of this
   supplement.
       4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR
       1230.
       4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance
       published by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is
       contained in 23, CFR 1204.
       4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
   4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing,
   searching, impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure
   they contain the following:
       4.2.2.1. Violations and conditions to tow or impound a vehicle.
       4.2.2.2. Procedures to notify the vehicle owner.
       4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing, storing, and protecting impounded vehicles.
       4.2.2.4. Procedures for disposing of vehicles after lawful impoundment.
   4.2.3. Where applicable, installation traffic codes must supplement the various basic
   provisions contained in the subparagraphs below:
       4.2.3.1. Motorcycles and mopeds. Operators must comply with special requirements
       when driving motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles
       powered by a motorcycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6 for information concerning
       off-road vehicle use. Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance
       concerning the legal definition, operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized
       bicycles, and other such devices on installation roadways. Such guidelines will be
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                     25


     modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or the safe and orderly flow
     of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing safety
     requirements.
     4.2.3.2. Restraint systems.
         4.2.3.2.1. Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on Air Force installations
         must wear restraint systems. In addition, operators and passengers of GOVs must
         wear restraint systems when driving or riding off the installation as well.
         4.2.3.2.2. All Air Force active duty and reserve component members on active duty
         must wear restraint systems while driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the
         installation.
         4.2.3.2.3. US Department of Transportation requires approved infant/child restraint
         devices in POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 50 pounds in
         weight.
         4.2.3.2.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved
         restraint system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
         4.2.3.2.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the
         manufacturer's primary restraint system (seat belts).
     4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is
     prohibited while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of
     hearing protection when conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when
     driving in noise hazard areas. This restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by
     motorcycle operators and their passengers.
         4.2.3.3.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Vehicle stereo systems will not be played at
         a volume that is heard farther than 25ft away from the vehicle. Vehicle operators
         have a responsibility to ensure music from their vehicles (amplified or not) does not
         exceed this distance. Noise that can be heard outside the vehicle and farther than 25ft
         will be deemed by the complainant as annoying or offending public decency and not
         witnessed by SFS will be documented in the SFS desk blotter and titled ―Public
         Nuisance Complaint.‖ Incidents witnessed by SFS may be cited on a DD Form 1408,
         Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, as ―Public Nuisance‖. SFS may enforce the ―Public
         Nuisance‖ law without a complaint being filed.
  4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation
  driving privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
  4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state
  traffic codes applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that
  state’s criminal offense code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United
  States Code 13 (USC).
     4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts
     the vehicular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not
     considered criminal offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these
     laws applicable to military installations having concurrent or exclusive federal
     jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to installation commanders to establish additional
26                                 AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


     vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regulations for their installations. Those found
     guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on installations under provisions of
     DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or imprisonment for not more
     than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you cannot assimilate
     traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in a
     prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
         4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate
         violations of traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally,
         this applies to installations under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
  4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee
  determines if, when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas,
  the operation of off-road vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict
  requirements concerning age, safety training, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-
  street" safety practices such as reflective vests, gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not
  apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity. However, ensure full compliance
  with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary, develop additional
  procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
  supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to
  designating any off-road vehicle use area.
  4.2.6. (LAUGHLIN AFB) The use of ATVs, including dirt bikes, gas or electric scooters,
  pocket bikes, mini-bikes, dune buggies, and go-carts are not authorized for on or off-road
  recreational use on Laughlin AFB. ATVs/Dirt Bikes are authorized only on the designated
  riding area located south of the Natural Trail on the West side of Laughlin AFB.
     4.2.6.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Laughlin AFB will incorporate Texas Traffic Code
     541.201, regarding mopeds, with the following restrictions. Moped operators must
     complete an AF motorcycle safety course and follow AFI 91-207 and the AETC
     Supplement safety rules for motorcycles.
     4.2.6.2. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Laughlin AFB will incorporate Texas Traffic Code
     551.341, regarding power-assisted scooters, with the following restrictions. Only
     Department of Transportation power-assisted scooters may be operated on Laughlin
     AFB. Gas operated or electric bikes/scooters must not exceed 40cc and may be operated
     at a minimum age of 14 years or under the age of 14 years under the supervision of parent
     or legal guardian.
  4.2.7. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Vehicle operators will turn on headlights from sunset to
  sunrise; during fog, smoke, or rain when windshield wipers are activated; and at any other
  time when persons and vehicles cannot be seen clearly. Points are assessed as operating an
  unsafe vehicle as per Table 5.2, basic publication.
  4.2.8. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Individuals cited for failure to produce a valid driver’s
  license, vehicle registration, or proof of insurance will report to the 47th Security Forces
  Squadron (S5R/Bldg 139) on the next duty day with the required documentation or is found
  not to have a valid driver’s license or insurance, revocation or suspension action will be
  initiated by 47 SFS/S5R.
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                      27


      4.2.8.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Individuals cited for mandatory vehicle equipment
      violations will report to (S5R/Bldg 139), within 72 hours with proof of corrective action.
      If the 72 hour period has expired, and the individuals have not shown proof of corrective
      action, the ticket will be processed for commander’s action.
4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within
   traffic laws and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective
   enforcement should emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers.
   You can reach these goals by developing effective programs in the following areas.
      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National
      Highway Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic
      Control Devices for Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with
      drivers, and act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a
      defective vehicle in operation.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with
      suspended or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a
      citation, or warn the offender.
   4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
      4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the
      influence of alcohol or drugs.
      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection
      techniques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs
      prevents their safe operation of a motor vehicle.
4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and
enforcement programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police
   training and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the
   same brand and model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible,
   attend the same or similar certification courses used by local authorities.
   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
      4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet
      training and certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the
      installation is located. Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and
      prerequisites for attending by contacting the state agency responsible for police traffic
 28                                    AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


       radar training. Notwithstanding the above information, the CSP may establish other local
       training and certification programs for operators of speed-measuring devices. If
       exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and training standards are
       admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil authorities.
       This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts
       used to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge
       advocate and attorney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
       4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's
       training program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar
       certification courses.
       4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the
       effectiveness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-
       measurement radar. On successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
          4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths,
          and injuries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
          4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
          4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement
          policy and procedure.
          4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s
          major components and functions.
          4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar
          instrument(s).
          4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and
          courtroom testimony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
   4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required
   by the state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification
   and training standards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit
   commanders when personnel PCS.
   4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
       4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
       4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-
       measuring devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the
       International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.
4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation.
   4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
   4.5.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) A 47 SFS Traffic Accident Investigator will conduct detailed
   traffic investigations for the following: combined vehicle accidents and government/private
   property damage or government/privately owned vehicle damage totaling more than $10,000.
       4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                        29


       4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the
       installation commander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and
       property damage; however, the installation commander may establish different damage
       amounts for each category.
   4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel
   according to local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
Note: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident
report form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.
   4.5.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) 47 SFS will not conduct off-base accident investigations. 47
   SFS/S5R will coordinate with local police agencies to receive a copy of accident reports
   occurring off-installation if they involve injuries to military personnel, damage to
   government property, or any other service related accident.
4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident
   to the security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries
   to military personnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines
   what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop
   a local notification matrix or other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate
   base and civilian agencies. Develop and publish these notification procedures locally.
       4.6.1.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Vehicle operators are required to report minor
       vehicle accident information to the Emergency Control Center (ECC) within 72 hours.
       Vehicle operators involved in minor vehicle accidents are responsible for exchanging all
       pertinent information and reporting the accident to their respective insurance companies
       and to SFS.
   4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident
   information. Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible,
   obtain copies of major accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
   4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions
   or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
   4.6.3. (LAUGHLIN AFB) SFS will respond to on-base major vehicle accidents and
   conduct initial investigations. A vehicle accident report will be accomplished when there are
   injuries reported, (whether medical attention is sought or not) when estimated combined
   damages total over $10,000, or when one vehicle operator is suspected of driving under the
   influence. Note: SFS will respond to vehicle accidents on base where an uninsured driver is
   alleged.
       4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
       4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
       4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.

       4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if
       minor vehicle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may
       delegate this authority to on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy
       in this area locally.
       4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security
       police within 72 hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This
       information should include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle
       operator(s), unit (or address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle
       description, and license number(s). You should also include a brief summary of any
       damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is any
       accident in which there are no fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the
       amount established by the installation commander. Consequently, a major accident is
       any accident involving a fatality, injury, or property damage above the amount
       established by the installation commander. The installation commander may set differing
       amounts for government versus private vehicle and property damage. The investigation
       of major accidents involve specialized accident investigative techniques to draw
       conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident occurred.
       4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor
       vehicle accident:
          4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
          4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is
          sought
          4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes,
          compression, or any other visible damage to the body.
4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
   4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes.
   When frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents,
   and other factors in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act
   information, make accident data and trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data
   for reporting and analytical purposes. With the exception of requests filed under the
   Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies cleared to receive accident and
   incident data.
   4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation
   reports will indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where
   applicable, if air bags deployed.
4.8. Parking.
   4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation.
   Strong enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing
   traffic accidents and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and
   awareness initiatives in areas where illegal parking is a problem. When education and
   awareness fail, installation commanders may authorize more serious enforcement measures
   such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use towing and booting if less severe
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                     31


  means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revocations, etc., prove
  effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
     4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing
     or booting to specific offenses.
     4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for
     immobilizing unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in
     high offense areas or to compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more
     effective for moving vehicles that pose safety hazards. Some examples include double
     parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
     4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing
     or booting. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
     4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how
     to have the boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
  4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders
  determine reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility
  design and layout, traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine
  the number and location of reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing
  reserved parking a part of the installation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic
  control instruction, or base parking plan. The publication must address approval, issue,
  control, and review of reserved parking and should give special consideration to bicycle,
  motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated under the uniform
  federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
  4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space
  assignments and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is
  placed on a vehicle bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification.
  MAJCOMs (or installation commanders if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop
  policy concerning the issue and control of the identification media discussed above.
  4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators,
  especially within off-street parking facilities.
  4.8.4. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Parking Warden Program.                   This section prescribes the
  procedures for controlling, issuing, maintaining, and accounting of tickets provided by the 47
  SFS/S5R or the SF Training (47 SFS/S3T) and specifies responsibilities of parking wardens
  assigned to units on Laughlin AFB. Parking wardens will monitor parking areas in their
  commander’s area of responsibility and only during normal base duty hours (EXCEPTION:
  parking wardens that monitor areas around facilities that conduct 24-hour operations may
  issue citations at any time a violation occurs). Unit commanders who opt to participate in the
  program will delegate, in writing, a minimum of one primary and one alternate warden in the
  grade of E-5/GS-5 (or higher) in their unit as their parking wardens. Appointed wardens will
  receive SF training on proper completion of tickets from 47 SFS/S5R or 47 SFS/S3T prior to
  performing parking warden duties. Appointment letters and training documentation will be
  maintained by 47 SFS/S5R, which is the OPR for this program.
 32                                   AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


   4.8.5. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Parking Warden. Refer to Attachment 4 for guidance on
   Parking Warden responsibilities.
4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force
   installations within Air Force channels.
   4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United
   States or its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following
   circumstances:
       4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
       4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the
       matter because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only
       proprietary legislative jurisdiction.
       4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
       4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the
       jurisdiction of the court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US
       district court.
   4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic
   Ticket, or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP
   determines who is authorized to issue those forms and what training they must complete
   before issuing either form. The DD Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active
   duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Military Academies to include the Coast Guard
   Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive duty training including commuting to
   and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title 10 of the United States
   Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the DD Form
   1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.‖
   4.9.3. (LAUGHLIN AFB) The DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, will be issued
   to all violators. The violator is issued the pink copy. The white and yellow copies are
   forwarded to 47 SFS/S5R. 47 SFS/S5R will log tickets in and forward them to the member’s
   unit for action. DD Forms 1408 may be used for any traffic violation contained in Air Force,
   MAJCOM, and FTW directives. DUI/DWIs are also annotated on DD Forms 1408 for active
   duty or reservists on active duty orders.
       4.9.3.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) The 47 SFS/CC has determined that all on-duty SF
       members and SF SNCOs and SF Officers on and off duty, along with properly trained
       Parking Wardens may issue DD Forms 1408.
       4.9.3.2. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) The DD Form 1408 may only be voided by the
       issuer or the 47 SFS/CC by writing ―Voided‖ on the front and indicating reason on the
       reverse, in the ―remarks section‖. The voiding official signs the reverse of the original
       copy of the ticket and returns it to 47 SFS/S5R to be put on file for ninety days and then
       destroyed. Unit commanders (or equivalents) and First Sergeants will annotate the action
       taken (including not guilty findings) on the reverse of the original DD Form 1408 and
       return the ticket to 47 SFS/S5R. Since tickets require command action, the violator’s unit
       or squadron section commander must sign the ticket. First Sergeants or other personnel
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                       33


     may complete the administrative process of the ticket; however, the commander or
     squadron section commander IAW AFMAN 31-201, Volume 7, paragraph 2.1.3.1, must
     sign the ticket. Rebuttal procedures are as follows:
     4.9.3.3. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Upon receipt of rebuttal letter, 47 SFS/S5R will
     request a statement from the issuing patrol. The statement, ticket, and rebuttal letter will
     be given to the 47 SFS/CC for review and he makes a decision. If the violator wants to
     rebut the 47 SFS/CC decision, the statement from the patrol and the ticket will be
     forwarded to 47 FTW/JA for legal review. Once the 47 FTW/JA has made a legal
     review, the rebuttal package will be forwarded to 47 MSG/CD for review and to make a
     decision based upon the 47 SFS/CC recommendations and the legal review. Note: The
     47 MSG/CD is the final authority on all rebuttals.
     4.9.3.4. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) If a determination of guilt is made, 47 SFS/S5R
     assesses points on moving violations; if determination is ―not guilty‖, no points are
     assessed. In all cases the SFMIS will be annotated with the finding. 47 SFS/S5R will
     notify applicable unit commanders (or equivalents) of rebuttal results.
     4.9.3.5. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Citations issued for failure to produce a valid
     driver’s license, vehicle registration, or proof of insurance will report to the 47th Security
     Forces Squadron (S5R/Bldg 139) on the next duty day with the required documentation
     or is found not to have a valid driver’s license or insurance, revocation or suspension
     action will be initiated by 47 SFS/S5R.
     4.9.3.6. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Citations issued for mandatory vehicle
     equipment/safety defects have 72 hours to correct the defect. The owner will report to
     Reports and Analysis (S5R) in the Security Forces Squadron (Bldg 139) with the vehicle
     to indicate it has been repaired. Failure to fix the defect in 72 hours will result in the
     ticket being processed for commander’s action.
  4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases
  through administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice
  (UCMJ) and federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military
  personnel and DoD civilian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance
  Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control.
  4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2, use the DD Form 1805 to refer
  civilian violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the
  commander, first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian
  employees is cited with the DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD
  Form 1805 and make it available to the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.
     4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through
     standard publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender.
     Before issuing this form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the
     US District Court (Central Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the
     communication, on the reverse of the violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part
     form. Determine the entry for the amount of the fine, mandatory court appearance of the
     offender, and the date of appearance according to guidance furnished by the governing
     district court.
 34                                   AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


       4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in
       the CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US
       magistrate.
           4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local
           staff judge advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause
           is required by the federal misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or
           arrest warrant.
       4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as
       follows:
           4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District
           Court (Central Violation Bureau).
           4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
           4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
Note: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.
       4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
           4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions
           and rebuttal instructions as determined by the installation commander.
           4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the
           commander of the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or
           employer for administrative action within the unit/organization.
           4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for
           processing and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit
           commander, section commander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received,
           review it for action taken, annotate the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313,
           Driver Record, with the moving or non-moving violation and any points assessed.
           File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.
4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the
   following:
       4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating
       motor vehicles.
       4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which
       adequately documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
       4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety
       test consists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus.
       Also consider any local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the
       above standard Air Force tests.
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                       35


       4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears
       intoxicated, but is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical
       attention.
       4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
   4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
       4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
       4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
   4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products
   list published in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as
   specified in paragraph 4.13 and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14 and
   4.15 relating to voluntary and involuntary testing.
   4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will
   develop their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian
   institutions or manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the
   installation staff judge advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure
   your program meets local requirements for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at
   the intervals determined by the CSP and staff judge advocate.
4.10. (LAUGHLIN AFB) 47 SFS/S3T is the OPR for overseeing the training of law
enforcement personnel for processing of intoxicated drivers. Use urine or blood testing when
military personnel are suspected of driving while under the influence of other drugs and during
special circumstances.
4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
   4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other
   enforcement measures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a
   person is tested per paragraph 2.3, evaluate the results of the test as follows:
       4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent,
       presume the person is not under the influence of alcohol.
       4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired.
       Consider this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person
       was under the influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5
       Note: The 0.10 threshold delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when
       assimilating a more stringent local, state, or host nation standard.
       4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or
       host nation standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person
       is considered to have been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving
       privileges according to para 2.5.1.3
   4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1 are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the
   blood based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will
   modify military standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation
   standard. Refer to Assessment #3, Table 5.1
 36                                   AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


4.11. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Use a DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, to document
Horizontal-Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test and Standard Field Sobriety Test results.
4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
   4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following
   circumstances:
       4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally
       accepted scientific and medical methods and standards.
       4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
       4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
   4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing
   devices, then apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1)
   During the initial traffic stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction
   with other field sobriety testing techniques as long as the state or host nation does not
   prohibit such use, and 2) According to the manufacturer's operating instructions.
       4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
          4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the
          breath specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew
          tobacco, or ingest any substance.
          4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to
          manufacturer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation
          requirements.
          4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current
          instruction manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's
          manual.
   4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
       4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon
       death of any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction,
       medical authorities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or
       mishap. Conduct tests for the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the
       blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as soon as possible and where practical within eight hours
       of death. Include the test results in the medical reports.
       4.12.3.2. . As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or
       breath sample from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.
4.12. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Blood testing is the preferred chemical test used on anyone
suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol on Laughlin AFB, except for special
circumstances as outlined in AFI 31-204, paragraph 4. 14.4. After duty hours, the Family
Medicine Physician On-Call will be the POC for medical reasons that qualify for non-punitive
refusal of a blood alcohol test, pending verification via medical records of same affliction.
4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                        37


   4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal
   driving behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving
   behavior. If you reasonably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired,
   perform field sobriety tests. The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and
   recording results of such tests. Use the standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10
   Specific procedures for administering them can be found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor
   Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for procedures and guidance concerning
   the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving reduction measures.
   4.13.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) NOTE: Individuals may be charged with DUI/DWI even if
   below the .080% presumptive legal limit. When a driver’s ability is shown to be impaired
   through other testing, they will be charged.
4.13. (LAUGHLIN AFB) The 47 MSG/CC is designated as primary probable cause
Search Authority (SA) for body fluids of personnel subject to the Uniform Code of Military
Justice (UCMJ) and the 47 MSG/CD is the alternate authority only if the 47MSG/CC is not
available. To seek search authorization, the requesting official initiates a conference telephone
call through the Wing Command Post with 47 FTW/JA and the SA. Air Force policy is further
addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of Clinical Services, for nonconsensual
extraction. Civilians suspected of DUI/DWI will be turned over to Val Verde Sheriff’s Office
for processing.
4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
   4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3
   4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
       4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a
       motor vehicle on the installation.
       4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the
       influence of alcohol or drugs.
       4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that
       failure to voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may
       result in revocation of on-base driving privileges.
   4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the
   driver that the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to
   voluntarily submit to or complete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the
   right to have an attorney present before deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing
   will follow policies and procedures in paragraph 4.12 Also advise the driver that you can use
   the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied consent provisions of this
   instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under Article 15 of the
   UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
   4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders,
   or any medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may
   refuse a blood extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both.
   You must outline these procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for
   nonpunitive refusal in readily available medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or
 38                                  AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


   other reasonable areas where blood samples might be drawn from those suspected of drunk
   driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a medical doctor.
   4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do
   not administer a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15
4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
   4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped,
   apprehended, or cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor
   vehicle and for whom probable cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated.
   Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence, and regulatory rules concerning requesting and
   granting authorizations for searches govern the extraction of body fluids in furtherance of
   other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual extraction of blood samples
   is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of Clinical Services.
   4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure
   authorizations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and
   who subsequently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced
   to submit to an involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions
   are considered only when an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death,
   serious personal injury, or significant property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe
   the individual was driving or was in control of a vehicle while under the influence of an
   intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the following procedures: 1) A search
   authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate obtained pursuant to Rule
   315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual extraction; 2) A
   search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear indication
   that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay
   necessary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the
   evidence sought; and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the
   servicing staff judge advocate and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official
   fail because of the unavailability of the appropriate commander or military magistrate.
       4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves
       unsuccessful (due to nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered
       by Rule 315(d), Military Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an
       individual located in the facility at the time an authorization is sought.
          4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the
          medical facility should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff
          judge advocate.
          4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule
          315(d) need not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person
          can perform the extraction.
          4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the
          individual in determining probable cause.
   4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary
   purposes by qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                         39


   defining medical care, such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR
   160-12. Only qualified medical personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable
   measures to accomplish the procedure. Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to
   the extraction is normally provided by law enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting
   under orders from the member’s commanding officer or designee. Do not use any form of
   life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
       4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical
       attention. Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions
       when other medical treatment is required.
4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3 can request additional testing. These
   tests are paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base
   hospital or research laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in
   a military or civilian court of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an
   overseas area) approves the test and test method. Complete all tests as soon as possible,
   noting any delay on the resulting documents.
   4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make
   those arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid
   when circumstances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason
   additional testing is not completed.
4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not
under military control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and
incidents of interest to local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the
sharing and exchanging of information with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures
are generally well documented in formal agreements with the host nation. Local procedures
must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of traffic and related incident reports received
from other investigative agencies.
4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
   4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws
   when operating government vehicles on or off base.
   4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before
   moving government vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits
   such as weight, length, width, or other standards.
   4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement
   agencies and encourage the following:
       4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators
       involved in accidents or incidents.
       4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of
       government motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious
       violations of civil traffic laws.
 40                                   AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


      4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or
      restrict the driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.
4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
   4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to
   coordinate military and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation
   commanders should cooperate and provide proper support and participation.
   4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic
   workshop program to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local
   communities. Sound and practical traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic
   enforcement, engineering, and education. Civilian and military legal and law enforcement
   officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public affairs officers should take part.

               DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents,
moving and parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments
involving military and DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel
operating motor vehicles on a military installation. In filling out the form, use the following
codes in the ―accident classification‖ block:
   5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as ―S‖ subject or
   ―V‖ victim.
   5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with ―MVA‖ minor vehicle accident; ―NLD‖ no
   liability determined; ―PD‖ property damage; ―PI‖ personal injury; ―G‖ government; ―P‖
   private; ―V‖ vehicle; and ―FO‖ fixed object.
   5.1.3. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Table 5-1, If revocation for implied consent violations is
   combined with another revocation, the revocations will run consecutively per Table 5.1.

Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
 Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
 commander.
 Violation: Driving while driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension or
 revocation.
 Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
 commander.
 Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).
 Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.
 Violation:
 1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
 2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
 0.10% or greater. Note: Where state or local authority use a more stringent standard (i.e., 0.08 instead
 of 0.10), Air Force units will assimilate the more stringent standard.
 3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
 other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
 4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.
 5. Fleeing the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury (hit and run).
 6. Perjury or making a false statement or affidavit under oath to responsible officials relating to the
 ownership or operation of motor vehicles.
 7. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle belonging to another, when the act does not amount to a felony.
 42                                   AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


 Assessment: 4. Suspension for a period of six months or less or revocation for a period not to exceed
 one year is discretionary.
 Violation:
 1. Mental or physical impairment (not including alcohol or other drug use) to the degree rendered
 incompetent to drive.
 2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
 grounds for suspension or revocation.
 3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
 4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
 5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
 6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.
NOTES:
  1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the
     effective date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation
     date of state or host nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.

   2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied
      consent violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-
      martial, nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as
      otherwise addressed in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined
      with another revocation such as one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run
      consecutively (total of 24 months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the
      installation commander’s policy systematically and not on a case-by-case basis.

commander or
designee.
5.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Unit commanders, First Sergeants, or individuals designated in
writing by their unit commander may review driving records of personnel assigned to their
unit. Civilian law enforcement investigators, military investigators (OSI, CID, etc.), and 47
FTW/SE personnel may review records with proper identification and official requirement.
5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative
device to impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a
disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to
interfere in any way with the reasonable exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to
issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate installation driving privileges.
5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein
are mandatory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on
and off the installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel
operating GOVs and POVs on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and
all other individuals subject to this instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an
individual submits a rebuttal, assess points according to the Table 5.2 Also assess points to
individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court, or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of
pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the point system for non-moving
violations.

instruments or to transmit simulated erroneous speed (prohibited on DoD
installations).
Driver involved in accident is deemed responsible (only added to points assessed for 1
specific violations).
NOTES:
  1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for
     the offense having the greater value.

   2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant
      fails to correct a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within
      the grace period on a warning ticket).

   3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant
      carrier, booster seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess
      four points when no restraint system of any kind is used.
5.4. Point System Procedures.
   5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805
   will serve as a basis for determining point assessment.
   5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving
   violation (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an
   inquiry. The commander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative
   action.
   5.4.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) When DD Forms 1408 are returned from unit commanders (or
   equivalents) and First Sergeants to 47 SFS/S5R with no disciplinary or administrative action
   taken, the 47 SFS/CC will contact the unit commander (or equivalent) and attempt to resolve
   the issue. If both agree a ―not guilty‖ finding is justified, no points will be assessed. If an
   agreement cannot be reached, a statement from the violator, any witnesses, and the SF
   personnel issuing the citation will be obtained. 47 SFS/S5R forwards any statements and the
   citation to 47 MSG/CC through the 47 FTW/JA for final determination. Points will be
   assessed when the unit commanders (or equivalent) ―not guilty‖ findings are overturned by
   47 MSG/CC.
   5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9
   5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as
   appropriate:
       5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
       acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
 46                                   AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


       5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any
       person who acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-
       month period.
       5.4.4.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Unit commanders and the individual will be notified when
       an individual accumulates eight or more traffic points.
       5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief,
       appears to have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on
       driving ability.
       5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill,
       awareness, or attitude.
       5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation,
       counseling, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all
       cases in which alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation,
       incident, or accident.
   5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by
   this instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
   5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one
   violation or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic
   points within 24 consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and
   revocation periods for offenses not covered in Table 5.1; however, any revocation must be
   for a period of 6 months or more. The installation commander may impose a longer
   suspension or revocation period (to include offenses in Table 5.1) based on the person’s
   overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and severity of moving violations,
   and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all cases, military members
   must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training before
   reinstatement of driving privileges.
   5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for
   24 consecutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during
   records update while recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations.
   Completion of a revocation based on points requires removal from the driver record of all
   points assessed before the revocation.
   5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving
   violations, chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain
   posted on individual driving records for the period of time indicated below.
       5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
       5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
       5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.
5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a
person assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released
from military service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                      47


   5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other
   entries on their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining
   installation. The gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue
   any Air Force suspension or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of
   traffic points. Traffic points for persons transferred will continue to accumulate as specified
   in para 5.4.7
   5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and
   AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military
   personnel released from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate
   reenlistment, change of officer component, or military and civilian retirement when
   continued vehicle registration is authorized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139
   records on civilian personnel who are terminating on-base employment or on-base
   registration.
   5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or
   other entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for
   service members. Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving
   privileges. Do not delete points accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding
   suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or chargeable accidents from the driver records
   except per para 5.4.7 and 5.4.8
5.5. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Personnel Actions Flight (47 FSS/DPM) will send a letter to the 47
SFS/CC twice a month containing a list of transferred personnel, personnel released from
military service, and personnel ending employment or affiliation with Laughlin AFB. This
will allow 47 SFS/CC to send the letter to the appropriate address.

                    IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement
personnel when towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This
policy is based on:
   6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow
   of vehicle traffic movement.
   6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable
   search and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.
6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
   6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public
   safety or convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity,
   or is stolen or abandoned.
   6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist.
   When possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If
   reasonably feasible, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first
   have permission from the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle.
   However in such cases, the security police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for
   safeguarding the vehicle.
   6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
      6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
          6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with
          the orderly flow of traffic.
          6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track,
          in a fire lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations
          or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
          6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
          6.2.3.1.4. In a ―tow-away‖ zone that is so marked with signs.
      6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
          6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the
          owner fail.
          6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
          6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
          6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore
          unable (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
          6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the
          public roadways.
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                     49


          6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or
          physically incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or
          safekeeping.
          6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.
          6.2.3.2.7. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Once a vehicle is identified as abandoned a DD
          Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice, will be placed on the vehicle and a DD Form
          1408 will be issued. If, after 72 hours, the vehicle has not been claimed or moved it
          will, at the on-duty Flight Chief’s discretion, be impounded by 47 SFS/S2I. The on-
          duty Flight Chief will ensure the owners First Sergeant is contacted, if applicable.
          The on-duty SF Controller will annotate the issuance of the DD Form 2504 in the SF
          Blotter and will attempt to contact the First Sergeant of the owner.
6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs
   depending on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
   6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation
   for use as an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted
   wrecker service provided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor
   impoundment areas and maintains keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
   6.3.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) The 47th Security Forces Investigations (47 SFS/S2I)
   Impoundment Lot located within the Recreational Vehicle Storage Lot, adjacent to Bldg 344,
   and/or the impoundment areas of authorized wrecker services are designated as authorized
   impoundment areas for Laughlin AFB. 47 SFS/S2I will maintain the on-base Impoundment
   Lot key(s).
      6.3.2.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) The on-duty Flight Chief will arrange for the
      wrecker. DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization, will be
      accomplished for abandoned vehicles and forwarded to 47 SFS/S2I. The on-duty SF
      Controller will annotate the DD Form 2505, and the impound lot spot number in the SF
      Blotter.
      6.3.2.2. (Added-LAUGHLIN AFB) Towing of vehicles is at the owner’s or operator’s
      expense.
   6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or
   involvement in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.
6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
   6.4.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) All motor vehicles are considered unattended and subject to
   ticketing when parked with no lawful operators in the vehicle, engine left running, ignition
   unlocked in the manner where keys are not needed or the key in the ignition. Note:
   Emergency Response vehicles or vehicles performing maintenance with proper signaling
   devices are not subject when performing official duties.
 50                                  AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010


      6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD
      5525.4), on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this
      action with an entry in the security police blotter.
      6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the
      vehicle. Have the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted
      wrecker service is used, complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
      6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD
      Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action
      taken.
          6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory
          listing personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless
          necessary to identify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public.
          In most cases, listing the container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
              6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
          6.4.1.3.2. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Personal property will be secured in the Lost and
          Found Property Locker located in Building #139 when unable to secure or protect
          property within the confines of the impounded vehicle.
          6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD
          5525.4), by certified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to
          advise the owner of the impoundment action and request information concerning the
          owner’s intentions concerning the vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
      6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes.
      Release recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary
      purposes, or to the law enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
      6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request
      the Air Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff
      such requests through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and
      support such requests and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the
      vehicle if civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as
      determined by the installation commander.
6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in
conjunction with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the
following general situations:
   6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and
   crime-related impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle
   unless evidence or contraband is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as
   evidence of criminal activity. When in doubt, obtain proper search authority before
   searching.
   6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal
   incident or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and
AFI31-204_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 8 OCTOBER 2010                                                       51


   sufficient probable cause exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present
   but is unwilling, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to
   safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may search vehicles without search authority
   when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is a risk of loss or destruction of
   evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search incident to apprehension.
6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
   6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law
   enforcement, or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority,
   release vehicles and property when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above.
   Review Title 10, USC 2575, Disposition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive
   4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking
   action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner or an authorized agent.
   6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts
   to contact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to
   assume responsibility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt
   to secure release of the vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD
   Form 2507. The 60-day waiting period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle
   to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed letter, power of attorney, or other legally
   recognized document.
      6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the
      vehicle as abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise
      directed, installation commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use
      for, or disposal of, abandoned property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale,
      Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are potential options. Consider local, state, or
      if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process vehicles through the Defense
      Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO and DoD directives.
      6.6.2.1. (LAUGHLIN AFB) Once the vehicle becomes property of the Air Force, 47
      SFS/S2I will contact the Property Disposal Board to sign the disposal letter. After
      coordination with 47 FTW/JA, the vehicle will be disposed of by releasing it to 47 FSS
      subject to the requirements of 10 USC 2575.
6.7. Forms Prescribed.
