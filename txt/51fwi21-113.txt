1. Introduction. In situations where the Hydrazine Response Team (HRT) leader determines
this instruction does not adequately cover procedures for the particular situation, authority is
granted to add to or deviate from the procedures when safety of personnel or damage to
equipment is involved.
2. Definition of Hydrazine. Hydrazine is a clear, oily liquid having an ammonia-like odor that
is corrosive and highly toxic.
                                          WARNING
                Non-essential personnel shall leave the immediate area
                to avoid breathing Hydrazine vapors. Failure to do so
                may result in personal injury. Personnel will exercise
                care to ensure that hydrazine does not come in contact
                with skin or eyes. All EPU activations and suspected
                hydrazine leaks will be treated as definite leaks until
                the HRT determines otherwise.


3. Hydrazine Training. All aircraft maintenance and aircraft fuel systems personnel will
receive familiarization training in the hazards of hydrazine. All unit commanders will ensure
that personnel with duties in the proximity of F-16 aircraft or hydrazine also receive training.
     3.1. The 51 MOS/MXOT will provide initial hydrazine familiarization training for all
     personnel.
     3.2. The 51 MXS/MXMCF, 51 CES/CED (EOD), 51 FW/SEG, 51 AMDS/SGPB, and 51
     CES/CEF will provide in-shop specialized training as required.
4. Designated Areas.
     4.1. Recovering Aircraft with a Fired EPU. If the aircraft is landing on runway 27, it will be
     parked in the “Hot Cargo Pad” or its alternate, Taxiway “A”. If the aircraft is landing on
     runway 09, it will be parked on taxiway “E” or its alternate, the hot brake/arming area.
     4.2. Routine EPU Maintenance: The primary hydrazine maintenance area is located in
     dispersal area “A”, (hard stand A-10 and A-11), and flow through 15 thru 24. This area will
     be utilized to perform maintenance of the F-16 EPU to include: H-70 tank replacements,
     purge and hook-up procedures, and mono-propellant checks.
     4.3. Authorized Storage Area. Building 1765 is the only facility on Osan AB authorized for
     the storage of hydrazine. This facility is only authorized to store Hydrazine Cylinders in
     Caskets.
5. Responsibilities. Any individual who discovers leakage of a clear liquid coming from the
aircraft or detects the presence of an ammonia odor will immediately evacuate the area, dial 911,
notify Maintenance Operations Control Center through the most expeditious means possible, and
seek immediate medical attention. Personnel will remain a minimum of 300 feet in all directions
from the suspected leak and direct response personnel upon their arrival. The following actions
will be taken upon notification of a suspected hydrazine leak or spill.
