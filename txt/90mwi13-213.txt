SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This rewrite implements new guidelines for the management of the Helicopter Movement Area
(HMA) at F. E. Warren AFB. The management responsibilities have been divided between the
37th Helicopter Squadron, and the Base Community Planner. The 90th Missile Wing Safety
Office will monitor the program and the HMA. The rewrite also reflects the newly adopted
Supervisor of Flight program.
1. Heliport Facilities
     1.1. Heliport facilities must permit safe, efficient and effective heliport operations.
     1.2. The Helicopter Movement Area (HMA) is the term used to identify the areas where
     helicopters routinely park, perform takeoffs, landings, hovering maneuvers and taxi
     operations.
     1.3. The HMA (Figure 1) is a controlled area. It includes: the area designated by barriers on
     Artillery Road; entry signs at the end of Post Road and the entrance road northeast of
     Building 1250; the aircraft parking ramp near Building 1250 (identified by red entry point
     lines and heliport markings); Helipad 2 located to the west-southwest of Building 1250 and
     connected to the ramp via a paved taxi way; the Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL)
     runways (13/31 and 05/23); and the grass infield surrounding the ramp and STOL.
90MWI13-213 22 MARCH 2012                                                                  3


Figure 1. Helicopter Movement Area




   1.4. The helicopter parking area is defined by painted spots numbered 1 through 6. The
   helipad on the ramp is designated as Helipad 1. The helipad located to the West west-
   southwest of Building 1250 and connected to the ramp via a paved taxi way is designated as
   the Limited Used Take-Off pad, or helipad 2. The STOL area is comprised of two grass
   landing strips oriented 13/31 and 05/23 and is located south of Artillery Road.
   1.5. The 37 HS/SOF monitors the HMA from Helicopter Operations. Any unusual condition
   on the heliport that may adversely impact the safety of helicopter operations will be
   immediately reported to Helicopter Operations. Helicopter Operations may be contacted via
   landline (ext. 2001) or by radio (Missile Net Frequency Heliops or UHF Frequency 271.9.)
 4                                                             90MWI13-213 22 MARCH 2012


     The 37 HS/SOF will immediately notify the 37 HS/DO, 37 HS/SE and 90 MW/SEF.
     90 MW/SEF will coordinate to eliminate the hazard. The 37 HS/DO will determine the
     immediate actions to be taken concerning flight operations based on an assessment of the risk
     and the nature of the hazard.
2. Duties and Responsibilities
     2.1. 37 HS/DO is responsible for the overall management of the heliport and facilities. The
     DO will ensure that crews have all flight planning materials needed for mission planning and
     that all materials are kept current. The DO will also ensure all Prior Permission Required
     (PPR) requests are coordinated for transient aircraft. The DO is responsible for insuring
     FEW AFB Heliport information is correct/updated in applicable Flight Information
     Publications (FLIP).
     2.2. 90 MW/SEF (Wing FSO) should perform monthly heliport inspections in accordance
     with Attachment 2. The areas inspected will include, but are not limited to: helipads, ramp
     and parking areas, the STOL, the grass infield area, ramp and runway markings, HMA signs,
     heliport lighting, barriers and obstacles. On a quarterly basis this inspection will be
     conducted jointly with the Base Community Planner.
     2.3. 37 HS/DO or facility manager is responsible for submitting AF Form 332s, Base Civil
     Engineer Work Request to the 90 CES Customer Service Unit, and notifying the Base
     Community Planner. If the AF Form 332 is being submitted to eliminate a hazard, the wing
     FSO will assume this responsibility.
     2.4. 90 CES is responsible for the maintenance of all helipads, ramp areas, the runway and
     all grass areas around the HMA. They will remove snow and ice when appropriate, will
     sweep the HMA weekly and upon request, will keep the grass cut from 7 to 14 inches in
     accordance with AFI 91202 and will maintain all heliport lighting.
        2.4.1. The Base Community Planner, 90 CES Asset Optimization Element, is the central
        point of contact for heliport management within the Civil Engineer Squadron.
        2.4.2. The Base Community Planner will ensure that work requests (AF Forms 332)
        comply with all 32series instructions and UFC 3-260-01, coordinate all work orders
        pertaining to the airfield, maintain the airfield obstruction waiver file and Etabs and
        validate and process airfield obstruction waiver requests.
     2.5. 90 CS will maintain the crash phones and the response talk group.
     2.6. 90 MW/CC is the final approval authority for changes to procedures in this instruction.
3. Heliport Use and Safety
     3.1. The heliport is routinely used only by the 37 HS. Other base agencies and units outside
     the 90 MW may request to use the heliport landing areas, or portions of the HMA.
        3.1.1. PPR requests from transient aircraft will be coordinated by the 37 HS according to
        paragraph 2.3. Any transient aircraft wishing to use the heliport for other than full stop
        landings, passenger pickup and drop off and take-offs for departure must get the approval
        of 37 HS/DO.
90MWI13-213 22 MARCH 2012                                                                     5


      3.1.2. Agencies or units wishing to use any portion of the HMA for nonaviation related
      activities will coordinate through 37 HS/DO to ensure that there is no adverse impact on
      Helicopter Operations.
4. Heliport Management Committee
   4.1. The Heliport Management Committee (HMC) will consist of: 90 MW/CV (or
   designated representative), 90 MW/SEF, 37 HS/CC (or designated representative), 37
   HS/DO (or designated representative), 37 HS/SEF, 90 CES/CC (or designated
   representative), 90 CES/CEAO, 90 CES/CEAN and 90 CES/CEOIE. The HMC will meet
   semiannually or more frequently if required.
   4.2. The HMC will address issues pertinent to the heliport to include, but not limited to:
   heliport construction, heliport maintenance, grass cutting, snow removal, Foreign Object
   Debris (FOD) prevention and any hazards near the heliport or HMA that may affect
   operations.
5. Helicopter Movement Area and Vehicle Access
   5.1. The use of motor vehicles on the HMA is necessary for normal operations and
   maintenance. Anyone operating a vehicle in the HMA must have a legitimate reason for
   specific access to this area. Using these areas as a thoroughfare, for convenience or to save
   time/mileage is strictly prohibited. The HMA is defined in paragraph 1.3 and is depicted in
   Figure 1.
   5.2. Motor vehicle traffic in the HMA is restricted to Government Motor Vehicles, vendor or
   contractor vehicles, or privately owned vehicles (POV) driven by key command personnel
   responding to an incident on the HMA.
   5.3. Exceptions to paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 require written authorization by 90 MW/SEF.
   5.4. The 37 HS/SOF monitors the HMA from Helicopter Operations and will grant access to
   motor vehicles for legitimate purposes. Helicopter Operations may be contacted via landline
   (ext. 2001) or by radio (Missile Net Frequency 4 or UHF Frequency 271.9). Approvals are
   required and granted for specific times or windows of time. Access clearance expires once
   the vehicle departs the HMA. Another clearance must be granted to reenter the HMA.
   Inform Helicopter Operations via radio or telephone when clear of the HMA.
      5.4.1. Fuel trucks receiving notification from helicopter maintenance for refueling
      constitutes clearance.
      5.4.2. Vehicles responding to helicopter emergencies do not require prior permission
      provided good judgment is used.
      5.4.3. Helicopter maintenance personnel may operate unrestricted in the helicopter
      parking and movement area.
      5.4.4. When Helicopter Operations is closed, contact base dispatch at ext. 2136 for
      approval to enter the HMA.
6. Prerequisites for Helicopter Movement Area Driving
   6.1. Squadron commanders assigning personnel to operate motor vehicles in the HMA must
   comply with the following:
 6                                                              90MWI13-213 22 MARCH 2012


        6.1.1. All drivers requiring access to the HMA must possess a valid state driver’s license.
        6.1.2. Only personnel necessary for mission accomplishment will be authorized to
        operate a motor vehicle in the HMA.
        6.1.3. Immediate supervisors will personally ascertain that their operators are physically,
        mentally and emotionally capable of performing assigned driving tasks.
        6.1.4. Appoint a unit trainer, usually the Vehicle Control Officer or the Unit Safety
        Representative, to ensure that all HMA driving prerequisites are accomplished and
        properly tracked.
     6.2. The unit trainer, usually the Vehicle Control Officer or the Unit Safety Representative
     will:
        6.2.1. Ensure that drivers are briefed on this instruction and the lesson outline established
        in Attachment 2. Other training materials are available from 90 MW/SEF. Trainers will
        conduct refresher training annually.
        6.2.2. Document the training on the individual’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
        Health Record or another tracking program.
        6.2.3. Maintain a list of personnel eligible to drive on the HMA and submit to
        90 MW/SEF when requested.
7. Helicopter Movement Area Driving Procedures
     7.1. Vehicles will enter and exit at the entry points designated at the terminus of Post Road,
     or from the parking lots adjacent to Building 1250. These entry points are illustrated in
     Figure 2.
90MWI13-213 22 MARCH 2012                                                                      7


Figure 2. HMA Entry Points




   7.2. Prior to traveling onto the HMA, drivers will stop at the entry point and ensure the area
   and surrounding airspace is clear of helicopter traffic.
      7.2.1. Helicopters always have the right-of-way. Vehicles not directly supporting ground
      operations or servicing will remain a minimum of 100 feet from operating helicopters
      (rotors not tied down) and clear of the intended flight path, and 50 feet from parked
      helicopters (rotors tied down).
      7.2.2. Never approach a running helicopter from the rear. Remain in front of or to the
      side of the helicopter whenever possible.
 8                                                                  90MWI13-213 22 MARCH 2012


         7.2.3. Drivers will plan routes on the HMA to avoid the taxi routes, helipads and landing
         areas to the maximum extent practical to preclude impacting hover, taxi and landing
         operations.
     7.3. Speed Limits:
         7.3.1. General Purpose Vehicles – 15 MPH
         7.3.2. Special Purpose Vehicles – 10 MPH
         7.3.3. All vehicles are restricted to 5 MPH within 50 feet of helicopters.
         7.3.4. Emergency response vehicles responding to an aircraft or ground emergency
         within the HMA may exceed the speed limit if the situation dictates and good judgment is
         used.
         7.3.5. Snow removal equipment may be driven at the recommended speeds to
         accomplish snow and ice removal.
     7.4. Drivers will not direct headlights to the front of an operating helicopter at night. The
     lights severely degrade the crew’s night vision capability. When operating on the HMA at
     night, always position the vehicle well clear of the helicopter and its taxi route. If the vehicle
     is positioned such that the headlights are directed at the helicopter, turn off the vehicle’s
     headlights and turn on the hazard lights until the helicopter has passed and will not be
     affected by the headlight beams.
     7.5. All vehicles will approach a helicopter with the driver’s side of the vehicle towards the
     front of the helicopter. Do not back a vehicle toward a helicopter unless a spotter is posted
     and a chock is positioned to preclude backing into the helicopter.
     7.6. When parking a vehicle on the HMA in other than designated parking areas and leaving
     the driver’s seat unattended, the following applies:
         7.6.1. Engine will be turned off. NOTE: Emergency or servicing vehicles may leave the
         engine running provided chocks and hand brake/parking brake are used.
         7.6.2. Select reverse (standard) or park (automatic) if the engine is to be turned off or
         neutral (standard) or park (automatic) if the engine will remain on.
         7.6.3. Set the parking or hand brake.
         7.6.4. Chocks will be used to secure all wheeled equipment that does not have an integral
         braking system or other times specified in this instruction. Chocks will be used during all
         refueling operations.
         7.6.5. Hazard lights or parking lights will be turned on during periods of darkness or
         limited visibility.
         7.6.6. Vehicles will remain unlocked with the keys in the ignition.
8. Helicopter Movement Area Driving Violations and Incursions
     8.1. An HMA violation is any negligent or willful act committed by an authorized HMA
     driver that violates the directives set forth in this publication or violates the safety of aircraft,
     personnel or equipment.
90MWI13-213 22 MARCH 2012                                                                  9


  8.2. An HMA incursion is any unauthorized movement or entry onto the HMA. Incursions
  present potential hazards to aircraft and personnel operating legitimately in this area.
  8.3. Violations and incursions will be reported to 37 HS/SOF as soon as possible after the
  event. 37 HS/SOF will submit the information in Attachment 3 to the 37 HS/DO for follow
  up. These actions are time critical so corrective action can be taken immediately.
  8.4. The 37 HS/DO will investigate allegations of a violation or incursion and collect the
  facts surrounding the event. If the evidence of a violation or incursion warrants
  administrative or other adverse action, the DO will submit the facts to the offender’s unit
  commander, as applicable. The unit commander will forward a recommendation to the
  installation commander for consideration and final action. Potential actions for these
  offenses follow:
     8.4.1. For an HMA violation:
         8.4.1.1. First offense – Suspension of HMA driving privileges for one week and
         retraining.
