                                          GENERAL

1.1. Purpose. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2232, Maintenance Training, establishes training
policy and procedures for personnel assigned to aircraft, munitions, and missile maintenance
organizations throughout the Air Force.
1.1. (AFMC)Purpose. This instruction provides guidance, procedures, and responsibilities for
aircraft and depot maintenance training programs as well as the civilian training program to
ensure maintenance personnel are qualified to perform assigned tasks.
1.2. Objective. Provide initial, upgrade, proficiency, qualification, recurring, and certification
training needed by a technician to perform duties in their primary Air Force Specialty Code
(AFSC). The overall capability of a maintenance unit depends on the state of training for
personnel assigned. Training is essen-tial to improving and sustaining unit capability and is one
of the most important responsibilities of com-manders and supervisors. When balancing
resources, (e.g., aircraft, support equipment, facilities, tools, funding, personnel, etc.)
maintenance training carries an equal priority with the operational training mis-sion.
1.2. (AFMC)Objective. Provide initial, qualification, and recurring training needed by AFMC
maintenance personnel in their job series.
   1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Training, qualification, certification and recurring certification
   requirements will be conducted IAW this instruction and its supplement and AFI 21-101,
   Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, AFMC Supplement 1 and its
   supplements, as applicable. Training that is required to maintain certification will be linked
   to the appropriate task. All depot maintenance training requirements will be retained in The
   Training Scheduling System-Production Acceptance Certification System (TSS-PAC),
   Section II, and applied as directed by all regulatory guidance. Test Wing (TW) maintenance
   training requirements will be retained in Training Business Area (TBA) or other HQ
   AFMC/A4 approved process.
1.3. Applicability. This instruction is directive in nature and applicable to commanders,
supervisors, Unit Training Managers (UTM), and personnel assigned to the Maintenance Group
(MXG), maintenance squadrons, MTF, and other maintenance organizations throughout the Air
Force.
NOTE: Certain sections of this AFI are not applicable to Air National Guard (ANG)/Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC), Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), and Nuclear units.
Organizations that do not have a Maintenance Training Flight (MTF) will complete skill level
training in their individual work centers. Performance-based activities (contractors and Most
Efficient Organizations (MEO) shall organize IAW AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program,
and shall implement the organization required in accordance with their contract or management
plan. Refer to MAJCOM instruc-tions for further guidance, where applicable. Specific training
requirements for Munitions, Nuclear and Missile activities are included in the appropriate 21-
2XX series instructions.
 10                                        AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010


1.3. (AFMC)Applicability. The maintenance training program also applies to all civilian
employees assigned to an AFMC depot maintenance organization, Maintenance Wing (MXW),
and maintenance personnel assigned to Test Wing maintenance organizations.
1.4. Equivalent Commanders. Throughout this instruction, responsibilities for the
Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC) are identified. For those units that do not align
under an Maintenance Group (MXG), their appropriate commander is equivalent.
1.4. (AFMC)Equivalent Commanders. AFMC is organized under a wing concept, with a
MXW Commander (MXW/CC) or equivalent. Responsibilities of the MXW/CC are identified
throughout this instruction
1.5. Terminology. When using this instruction, the following applies:
   1.5.1. Must - Indicates a mandatory requirement.
   1.5.2. Will - Indicates a mandatory requirement.
   1.5.3. Should - Indicates a preferred or recommended method or option.
   1.5.4. May - Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method or option.
1.6. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The MTF is the single point of contact for
maintenance training within the MXG In Accordance With (IAW) applicable AFI 36-2201
volumes and this publica-tion.
NOTE: The UTM or civilian equivalent will serve as OPR for those units without an MTF.
1.6. (AFMC)Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The Maintenance Training Flight
(MTF)/TW-Maintenance Training Detachment (MTD) is the single point of contact for
maintenance training within the MXW/TW-Maintenance Group (MXG).
NOTE: (Depot only) Civilian equivalent to squadron-level Unit Training Manager (UTM) is
Group Training Manager (GTM).
1.7. AETC Training Detachment (TD) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC units). TD is the
primary air-craft maintenance training agency on base. IAW AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance
and Procedures, and AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, host wings will develop
support agreements between sup-pliers and receivers of resources to document recurring day-to-
day peacetime support. The Host-Tenant support agreement should address facilities, Operations
and Maintenance (O&M) funding, administrative support, Government Vehicle (GOV)
allocations;   aircraft   support    equipment     to   include    sustainment   costs,    and
organizational/intermediate maintenance support of equipment beyond the TD capability.
   1.7.1. Air Education and Training Command (AETC) TD will be utilized as the primary
   maintenance training resource at all bases with an assigned TD. The TD will not be
   responsible to conduct ancillary training. The MTF will develop courses and supplement
   training when the training requirements are beyond the capability and timely response of the
   TD. The MTF will not duplicate training provided by the TD.
   1.7.1. (AFMC) Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is the primary training
   agency for weapons system specific systems training.
AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010                                                         11


   1.7.2. (Added-AFMC) The MXW/TW-MXG is the host of the Depot Maintenance Field
   Training Detachment (FTD) instructors. There is an AETC/AFMC Memorandum of
   Agreement for Depot Maintenance FTD program.
1.8. MAJCOM M andatory Course List (MMCL) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC, and
ICBM). Lead Commands will create a master list of all mandatory TD, MTF, and Advanced
Distributed Learning (ADL) courses for each mission design series aircraft. MAJCOMs will
conduct annual audits by review-ing monthly Status of Training reports to ensure all personnel
identified to attend applicable MMCL courses complete those courses. Personnel will begin
required TD courses within 180 days of assignment to the work center. ADL courses will be
completed prior to taking the TD course they apply to or within 180 days of assignment to the
work center, whichever comes first. If more than one TD course is required or the individual
needs to complete an MMCL prerequisite, then the individual must start each subsequent course
within 180 days of completion of the previous course or prerequisite.
1.8. (AFMC)MAJCOM Mandatory Course List (MMCL). TW MXG/CC will determine
which Lead Command courses are mandatory for members assigned to multiple airframes. The
TW-MXG/CC will determine locally which courses on the MMCL apply for the various series
and AFCs. Depot Maintenance occupational series course requirements are determined by
AFMC Civilian Utilization and Training Workshop (CU&TW) and are identified in the
employee’s Civilian Training Plan (CTP).
   1.8.1. MMCL courses are required for personnel in the following categories:
       1.8.1.1. Recent technical school graduates, either entry level or retrainees, who perform
       mainte-nance in a sortie producing or backshop AFSC.
       1.8.1.2. Personnel with no prior experience on assigned Mission Design Series (MDS)
       aircraft or who have not performed maintenance duty on the assigned MDS within the
       past 3 years.
NOTE: All master sergeants and above with less than 1 year experience on the assigned MDS,
who supervise maintenance personnel, will complete the appropriate TD or ADL familiarization
courses.
       1.8.1.3. (Added-AFMC) The CTP identifies the MMCL for each occupational series.
       MXW personnel must complete mandatory requirements.
1.9. Utilization of Training Courses. Units will use AETC, TD, MTF and ancillary training
courses for upgrade, proficiency, qualification, recurring, and Cross Utilization Training (CUT).
   1.9.1. These courses will be used to the fullest extent possible.
       1.9.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Command maintenance training courses shall be identified by
       HQ AFMC/A4D. Command maintenance training courses shall be used when available
       and applicable to the requirement.

1.13. Cross-Utilization Training (CUT). CUT training provides the unit internal flexibility by
training individuals to perform tasks that are not in their primary AFSC. This training can offset
periods of austere or low skill level manning. It also enhances combat capability by developing a
pool of qualified personnel to draw upon during surges. Use care not to create a dependency
upon CUT trained personnel for every task. CUT will never be a long-term fix or management
solution for an AFSC shortfall. Ensure the train­ing records of individual’s receiving CUT are
appropriately documented. NOTE: This guidance does not apply to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) (Predator/Global Hawk) weapon systems or other weapon sys-tems where Air Force
approved maintenance philosophy dictates the merger of AFSCs.

        1.21.4.2.4. Reporting procedures: MAJCOMs will provide a semi-annual report to
        HQ USAF/ ILMM on 1 April and 1 October, summarizing the MAJCOM experience
        levels in each of the target AFSCs IAW specified reporting criteria. Reports will
        portray:
           1.21.4.2.4.1. The total number of personnel by Controlled Air Force Specialty
           Code (CAFSC) who have been assigned to a SEI coded or uncoded position with
           TOS of 18-24, 25-36, and more than 36 months who do not have a unit relevant
           SEI awarded to any AFSC, will be reported IAW the format contained at the HQ
           USAF/ILMM                   aircraft            main-tenance               website:
           HTTPS://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-AF-35 In
           addition, provide specific reasons/logic for each individual without being awarded
           SEI and greater than 36 months TOS.
     1.21.4.3. Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC).
        1.21.4.3.1. Monitor the group experience levels as indicated by the number of
        assigned per-sonnel with SEIs awarded versus the total number of personnel assigned
        within the AFSC/ PEC.
        1.21.4.3.2. Implement actions to ensure individuals with more than 24 months TOS
        without award of SEI complete all requirements before the 36 months TOS to
        preclude having to report those individuals to Air Staff.
        1.21.4.3.3. Provide the reason why any assigned personnel with more than 36 months
        TOS has not been awarded a SEI resulting from assignment to a coded position, to the
        MAJCOM OPR. Provide the proposed date each of these individuals is anticipated to
        be awarded the applicable SEI.
     1.21.4.4. The Maintenance Operations Officer (MOO)/Superintendent is the unit focal
     point for SEI management. Unit commanders/MOO/Superintendent will:
        1.21.4.4.1. Assign personnel to authorized positions consistent with requirements,
        individuals grade, and skill level.
        1.21.4.4.2. Ensure previously awarded SEIs are re-designated to newly awarded
        AFSCs dur-ing personnel upgrade actions.
AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010                                                        21


         1.21.4.4.3. Ensure individuals are awarded the assigned weapons systems SEI to an
         awarded AFSC when SEI awarding criteria contained in AFMAN 36-2108 has been
         met.
         1.21.4.4.4. For multiple MDS units, initiate action to award additional relevant SEIs
         if/when an individual gains experience on additional MDSs. Award additional SEIs
         using AF Form 2096, Classification/On-The-Job Training Action, or P-series orders.
         1.21.4.4.5. Ensure that those personnel with 18-24 months TOS, without an SEI
         applicable to the unit of assignment, and assigned to positions not coded with an
         airframe, engine, or sub-system SEI are rotated into positions where an applicable
         SEI may be earned and awarded.
  1.21.5. Code UMD positions in the following manner:
     1.21.5.1. Do not code Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), tool room, safety, vehicle
     NCOs, quality, or other staff/support functions with weapon system or engine SEIs.
     1.21.5.2. MAJCOMs must ensure that only those positions where relevant hands-on
     experience can be gained are coded with the weapons system/engine-specific SEI based
     upon the following guidelines.
     1.21.5.3. Code positions with the weapons system SEI: 2A0X1A/B, 2A3X1X, 2A3X2,
     2A3X3X, 2A5X1X, 2A5X2X, 2A5X3, 2A6X3, 2A6X4, 2A6X5, 2A6X6, and 2W1X1
     (including armament backshops).
     1.21.5.4. Code positions with weapons systems/avionics systems as determined by the
     lead com-mand for Mobility Air Force (MAF)/Combat Air Force (CAF), or HQ AFSOC:
     2A0X1C/D.
     1.21.5.5. Code positions with engine SEI where personnel can receive hands-on engine
     experi-ence (flightline, Jet Engine Intermediate Maintenance (JEIM), and test cell):
     2A6X1A/B.
     1.21.5.6. Code positions with either weapons system or low observable SEI: 2A7X3.
     1.21.5.7. Electro-environmental (2A6X6) and hydraulics (2A6X5) back shop positions
     will be coded with weapon system SEI where personnel can receive hands-on experience
     (flightline, can-nibalization and phase/isochronal inspection docks).
     1.21.5.8. Aerospace Repair (A/R) shops will be coded with the A/R SEI.
     1.21.5.9. For units having positions on their UMD funded by another MAJCOM under a
     host/ten-ant or memorandum of agreement, the positions will be coded with the
     coordination/ approval of the funding MAJCOM.
     1.21.5.10. MAJCOMs may code additional positions with appropriate SEIs with the
     concurrence of the MAJCOM functional manager.
  1.21.6. Triggers. The trigger point is the point where MAJCOMs must review unit
  experience/man-ning levels for further action. MAJCOMs may develop their own trigger
  point, with justification, based on the total number of personnel assigned in the AFSC vs. the
  number of personnel holding a wing applicable awarded SEI. As a minimum, the experience
  baseline will be 60%. If experience lev-els in a specific AFSC fall below this point,
 22                                         AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010


   MAJCOMs should consider steps to help alleviate the sit-uation. These may include
   Temporary Duty (TDY), manning assistance, assignment availability codes, using SEIs in the
   overseas selection/returnee allocations cycle, when available, to direct people with the
   required SEI into a particular location, or command leveling using skill level, SEI, and time
   on station as the assignment selection criteria. Any request for assistance to AFPC will be
   accompa-nied by justification to include total personnel assigned in the AFSC, number of
   personnel in the wing holding an awarded, relevant SEI and the number of personnel with
   greater than 36 months time on station without an award of an SEI. Units with personnel on
   station longer than 36 months with no SEI awarded will have difficulty justifying their need
   for assistance.
NOTE: This trigger point does not affect or prevent SEI selection rates approved by MAJCOMs
or AFPC through normal channels.
1.22. The Maintenance Training Advisory Group (MATAG):
   1.22.1. Purpose. HQ USAF convenes the MATAG periodically to provide a cohesive
   approach to improving readiness through better maintenance training. The MATAG reviews
   current maintenance training problems and successes, coordinates maintenance training
   initiatives, and advises the Air Force ILM on overall maintenance training programs. In
   addition, the MATAG:
       1.22.1.1. Sets maintenance training goals and priorities.
       1.22.1.2. Reviews training programs impacting maintenance, including ancillary
       training, and recommends changes to program OPRs.
       1.22.1.3. Evaluates emerging training technologies.
   1.22.2. Membership. Voting members of the MATAG include HQ USAF/ILMM, HQ
   USAF/ILMW, and each MAJCOM, Forward Operational Area ( FOA), and Direct Reporting
   Unit (DRU) with main-tenance training responsibilities. Other interested people may attend
   but may not vote. AFLMA, and AETC/DOOM will be an advisor to the MATAG.
       1.22.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Provide inputs to HQ AFMC/A4D to ensure TW civilian
       training programs representation and inputs to MATAG.
1.23. Training Continuity Books (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC and ICBM
units). Develop and main-tain a training continuity book for every duty position in the MTF.
Each book depicts procedures for accomplishing tasks associated with each duty position. Write
continuity books to a standard that permits a newly appointed person to comply with existing
policy and procedures with minimal assistance.
NOTE: Combine the MTF Chief duty position and Training Management Section Chief duty
position tasks into one book.
1.24. Unit Training Assessments (UTA) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC/ICBM units). The
MTF is responsible to ensure every maintenance unit conducts a UTA every 18 months. These
assessments will be conducted to make sure personnel are kept updated with changes in new core
tasks or local supervisor supplemental task requirements added to the CFETP. The UTM serves
as OPR for their respective unit and will conduct this review with assistance from work center
supervisors.
AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010                                                          23


1.24. (AFMC)Unit Training Assessments (UTA). AFMC Depot Maintenance/TW-MXG does
not have a requirement for UTA. (TW Only) TW-MXG conducts Unit Staff Assistance Visits
(SAVs) IAW AFI 36-2201V3, Air Force Training Program On The Job Training
Administration.
   1.24.1. As a minimum, UTM will review the Master Training Plan (MTP) and Master Task
   List (MTL), for the following:
       1.24.1.1. Ensure most-current CFETP or change notice is posted.
       1.24.1.2. Ensure any new core task or local supervisor supplemental task requirements
       are identi-fied.
   1.24.2. Workcenter supervisors will review individual training records in conjunction with
   the UTA to ensure they reflect the most current CFETP or change notice.
   1.24.3. The UTA may be combined with the 18-month unit Staff Assistance Visit (SAV)
   required in AFI 36-2201, volume 3, Units using MIS Training Business Area (TBA) to
   document training do not have to comply with this requirement.
1.25. Training Assessment Feedback (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC and ICBM
units). The MTF Chief serves as OPR for local administration for internal and Office of
Collateral Responsibility (OCR) for external feedback:
1.25. (AFMC)Training Assessment Feedback. AFMC Depot Maintenance does not have a
requirement for Training Assessment Feedback.
   1.25.1. Establish a feedback loop, in the maintenance training operating instruction, between
   the Quality Assurance Program (QAP) and the MTF that focuses on training deficiencies.
   1.25.2. Ensure training feedback (internal and external) surveys are returned.
   1.25.3. Report external survey (Graduate Assessment Surveys, Field                 Evaluation
   Questionnaires, Occupational Surveys, etc.) results in the SOT report/briefing.
1.26. (Added-AFMC) Formal Training. Formal training is instruction based on established
learning objectives that enable the instructor or trainer to provide accurate, complete and
consistent information time after time. Formal training is assigned a course number to document
student completions in employee records. The most common methods of formal training used in
the Depot Maintenance Training Program are:
   1.26.1. (Added-AFMC) Instructor-led Training. A qualified instructor presents the
   material to a group of students in a classroom, laboratory, etc., setting. This is often called
   classroom training and includes instructional briefings that provide accurate and consistent
   instruction on a topic.
       1.26.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Instructor and Trainer Qualifications. Those who provide
       formal training to depot maintenance employees require the courses specified below,
       depending on their roles.
          1.26.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Structured On-the-Job Training (SOJT) Trainer
          Qualifications. Personnel who provide SOJT using an SOJT worksheet and guide
          shall complete the AFMC SOJT Trainer Course.
 24                                         AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010


           1.26.1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Instructor Qualifications.          Personnel who provide
           formal training using a plan of instruction shall complete the Air Force Principles of
           Instruction Course, or equivalent.
   1.26.2. (Added-AFMC) SOJT. A trainer uses prepared guides, evaluation worksheets,
   technical data, and other materials to provide practical instruction on tasks in the job
   environment.
       1.26.2.1. (Added-AFMC) SOJT Worksheet. Employee completion of formal structured
       on-the-job-training is documented by the SOJT Trainer on an SOJT worksheet. The
       SOJT worksheet will be a standalone document. The SOJT trainer forwards the
       completed worksheet to the appropriate Training Manager for retention and database
       entry. Refer to Attachment 3 (Added) of this instruction for SOJT worksheet format and
       additional processing information. Changes to the SOJT worksheet will not be made
       without approval by the MTF.
   1.26.3. (Added-AFMC) Self-Paced, Computer-Hosted Training. A student takes a self-
   paced course hosted on a computer or the internet. This may be accomplished in a classroom
   or learning center environment with a facilitator present.
   1.26.4. (Added-AFMC) Self-Paced, Interactive, Computer-Based Training (CBT). A
   student takes multi-media instruction controlled by a computer. The training is designed to
   allow the student to interact with the learning environment through input devices such as a
   keyboard, mouse, or light pen. The student’s decisions and inputs to the computer determine
   the level, order, and pace of instructional delivery.
1.27. (Added-AFMC) Informal Training. Informal training does not have defined learning
objectives. It provides the same basic information but not always in the same way or at the same
level of detail time after time. It is tailored specifically to the situation and the audience.
Informal training is sometimes assigned a course number to document student completions in
employee records. There are basically three (3) types of informal training in the Depot
Maintenance Training Program. They are:
   1.27.1. (Added-AFMC) Traditional On-the-Job Training (OJT). An employee works with
   the trainer on a day-to-day basis to obtain task knowledge and experience. The task trainer
   supervises the work of the employee until the individual is proficient enough to work alone.
       1.27.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Reference(s): Detailed information on OJT can be found in
       the following directives: AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, Air Force Training Program On the
       Job Training Administration.
   1.27.2. (Added-AFMC) Informational Briefing. A presentation that provides facts on a
   topic, but does not have established learning objectives. Its purpose is to inform the audience
   without determining if they have attained a particular level of knowledge.
   1.27.3. (Added-AFMC) Reference Guide or Training Aid. Materials that reinforce
   knowledge and skills such as training manuals, student workbooks, on-line reference tools,
   flowcharts, desktop reference guides, etc., are examples of this informal training method.
   They provide just-in-time, self-paced instruction on a specific topic.
AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010                                                        25


1.28. (Added-AFMC) Depot Maintenance Courseware. All depot maintenance formal
training shall be developed, approved, and maintained in accordance with applicable Air Force
Instructions.
   1.28.1. (Added-AFMC) Implementation of Revised Command Recurring Training. All
   personnel shall receive revised recurring training at the next regularly scheduled due date
   unless directed by MXW/CC or higher authority.
   1.28.2. (Added-AFMC) Implementation of New Command Training. Time required to
   implement new command courses shall be 12 months.
   1.28.3. (Added-AFMC) Awarding Credit for Command Training. A student shall be
   awarded completion credit for a command course only if all learning objectives in that course
   have been accomplished. Material may be added to, or deleted from, a command course as
   long as the learning objectives are instructed to the proficiency levels required.
   1.28.4. (Added-AFMC) All wings will register and maintain depot maintenance
   courseware in the Courseware Management Database (CMD).
1.29. (Added-AFMC) Recurring Training Requirements (RTR). Refresher training is
mandated to maintain knowledge and skills. General RTRs are not directly related to a specific
task, but apply to an occupation or a group of similar tasks. They are listed in Attachment 4
(Added) and local supplements. Task-related RTRs are listed in AFI 21-101, AFMC Sup 1,
Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.

                   MAINTENANCE TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

3.1. Introduction. The purpose of this chapter is to provide training documentation and
evaluation instructions that are unique to maintenance career fields.
3.2. Training Documents.
   3.2.1. Use automated training documentation forms, CFETPs, JQS, and (QTP) in CAMS,
   IMDS or Air Force approved MIS when available.
   3.2.1. (AFMC) MXW employees will use AF approved MIS (TSS, ETMS, ADLS, CAMS,
   etc.) and SOJT worksheets as applicable.
   3.2.2. Use AF Form 2426, Training Request and Completion Notification, or approved
   electronic form, to request training or record training completions. The electronic form must
   be mutually agreed upon by host wing MTF and TD.
      3.2.2.1. The group commander is the final approval authority for all versions of the AF
      Form 2426.
   3.2.3. Use AF Form 898 (not applicable to ANG/ARFC units), or approved electronic form,
   to man-age, forecast, and request unit TD training requirements. Use this form to identify,
   prioritize, and request wing TD course requirements. MTFs and TDs supporting AETC units
   will use the AF Form 898 or electronic form for scheduling TD systems and associate
   courses. The electronic form must be mutually agreed upon by host wing MTF and TD. Units
   who use an electronic product must ensure all areas identified on the AF Form 898 are
   included.
   3.2.3. (AFMC) TW-MXG does not perform this function. No supporting FTD.
      3.2.3.1. This document, once approved, is a contract between the host wing and the
      AETC TD.
      3.2.3.2. The group commander is the final approval authority for all versions of the AF
      Form 898.
      3.2.3.3. Upgrade Training Waivers. See comprehensive guidance for training waivers in
      AFMAN 36-2108 and AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel.
      3.2.3.4. Maintenance Training Flight coordinates training course control documents
      (CCD) deal-ing with explosive safety annually through the wing weapons safety office.
NOTE: The MXG/CC may delegate to the MTF Commander/Chief.
   3.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Training Documentation. Documentation is the evidence that
   training has been completed. It is required for all formal training and is in the form of:
      3.2.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Course Attendance Rosters.
      3.2.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Course Completion Certificates.
      3.2.4.3. (Added-AFMC) SOJT Worksheets. Employee completion of formal structured
      on-the-job-training is documented by the SOJT Trainer on an SOJT worksheet. The
AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010                                                            43


       SOJT Trainer submits the completed worksheets to the trainee's supervisor, who verifies
       the completion information and forwards completed form to the GTM for input into TSS
       /PAC/ETR. The GTM will retain completed SOJT worksheets for a minimum of 12
       months. Refer to Attachment 3 of this instruction for SOJT worksheet format and
       additional processing information.
       3.2.4.4. (Added-AFMC) AF Form 1151 Training Attendance and Rating.                In
       accordance with AFI 36-401, The AF Form 1151 or equivalent shall be used to document
       student attendance at Air Force sponsored training courses.
       3.2.4.5. (Added-AFMC) SF 182, Authorization, Agreement, Certification Of Training.
       3.2.4.6. (Added-AFMC) Other HQ AFMC Authorized Automated System.
       3.2.4.7. (Added-AFMC) Granting Training Equivalency. Only the GTM or TW-MTD
       Chief may grant equivalency for formal training requirements. The GTM or TW-MTD
       Chief can only grant equivalencies for individuals based on training documentation from
       official academic, civilian, private industry or military records. Training equivalency
       documentation shall be maintained by the GTM or TW-Squadron UTM for a minimum
       of one year.
           3.2.4.7.1. (Added-AFMC) Training equivalency shall not be granted for safety
           courses.
           3.2.4.7.2. (Added-AFMC) The GTM or TW-Squadron UTM will document training
           equivalencies in Section IV of the employee’s TSS-PAC/ETR.
3.3. Training Records. As a minimum, training records will be kept on all personnel in
military rank of TSgt and below as well as any other personnel in upgrade training or retraining.
Additionally, documen-tation will be kept on all MSgts and above who perform maintenance on
aircraft, missiles and associated equipment regardless of rank. Consideration should be given to
tasks these people might be called upon to perform while deployed.
3.3. (AFMC)Training Records. This section only applies to military personnel below the
grade of MSgt or those retraining.
   3.3.1. MSgts and above need only be certified on the "hands on" tasks they may normally be
   expected to perform. This does not have to include career field core tasks or local upgrade
   requirements unless they will be doing these tasks. An AF Form 623 (Air Force Training
   Record), Air Force Form 623a and CFETP will be used to provide a record of qualification.
   ARC may use CFEPT or MIS system to document training for MSgt and above.
   3.3.2. There is no special requirement for development of a training record for individuals
   performing task certification only. ICBM maintenance organizations will follow training
   management require-ments in AFI 21-2XX.
3.4. Core Tasks. Core tasks, as identified in the specialty training standard (STS) portion of the
CFETP, designate minimum on-the-job (OJT) training requirements for skill-level upgrade in an
AFSC. MAJ-COM Functional Managers, commanders, and supervisors may designate additional
critical tasks as required for upgrade training. When designated, certify these critical tasks using
normal core task certifi-cation procedures. As a minimum, certification on all AFCFM-directed
core tasks applicable to the spe-cialty must be completed for skill level upgrade. Exemptions:
 44                                           AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010


3.4. (AFMC)Core Tasks. This section only applies to military personnel below the grade of
MSgt or those retraining.
   3.4.1. Core tasks, which are not applicable to base assigned aircraft, missiles or equipment,
   are not required for upgrade (units are not required to send personnel TDY for core task
   training).
   3.4.2. For units with more than one mission design (e.g., A-10) aircraft or missile system,
   upgrade trainees need only complete core tasks on a single MDS. MFMs, unit commanders,
   and or supervisors may require trainees to complete core task training on additional mission
   design aircraft or missile system, if desired. If some of these core tasks involve training in
   another unit on base, trainees must still complete all core tasks relevant to at least one
   mission design aircraft or missile system. These additional tasks will not be upgrade training
   requirements for the individual. All units are bound by the requirements in this instruction
   and will accommodate core task trainees from other units.
3.5. Third-Party Certification of Core Tasks. The latest revision to AFI 36-2201 significantly
changed policy requiring third-party certification of CFETP core tasks. The new policy gives the
AFCFM the authority to designate those core tasks that require third-party certification. AF/ILM
does not require third-party certifications of core tasks in maintenance CFETPs (2AXXX,
2MXXX, 2PXXX, 2RXXX, 2WXXX). Maintenance tasks that are mission-critical or have a
definite potential for personnel injury or damage can be documented on the Special Certification
Roster (SCR) IAW AFI 21-101. Keep in mind, personnel will still have to be trained on all core
tasks IAW with the specific CFETP prior to skill-level upgrade. In this case, the trainer will
fulfill the role of both trainer and certifier, and the trainee will still have to demonstrate task
proficiency to the go level before being signed off.
3.5. (AFMC)Third-Party Certification of Core Tasks. This section only applies to military
personnel below the grade of MSgt or those retraining.
   3.5.1. MAJCOMs, commanders, and workcenter supervisors still retain the option to
   designate criti-cal tasks (core or non-core), not already tracked on the SCR, that require third-
   party certification. The goal is to delegate this authority to the lowest level. To designate a
   task as requiring third-party certi-fication, circle the appropriate asterisk in the core task
   column on the STS portion of the CFETP in the master task list (MTL) and individual
   training records. If the task is not already designated as a core task, place just the circle at the
   appropriate location in the core task column.
3.6. (Added-AFMC) Civilian Training Plan (CTP).
   3.6.1. (Added-AFMC) Purpose.        CTPs are the required command training source
   documents for all non-supervisory technicians and non-supervisory support personnel
   occupational series within the Maintenance Group. CTPs identify and document education
   and training requirements, training support constraints, and job task requirements for a
   maintenance occupational series. Job tasks and training requirements shall be identified in
   the CTP.
   3.6.2. (Added-AFMC) MXG/CC will ensure MXG CTP policies and guidance are
   identified in local Operating Instructions (OI).
AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010                                                            45

   MAINTENANCE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS) TRAINING BUSINESS AREA
                             (TBA)

4.1. Introduction. Maintenance training is one of many CAMS and CAMS-For Mobility
(G081) legacy applications that are being transformed into one of the Air Force approved MIS
business areas. The pro-posed MIS design calls for six to seven new business areas to support
wing level maintenance processes. The TBA satisfies one of these processes. MIS will enhance
training management production by automat-ing information contained in AF Form 623 (paper-
based) record and legacy applications. This will increase readiness, and improve sustainability of
Air Force weapon systems and equipment. Systems cur-rently approved for use in training
management are CAMS and G081. These systems are designed to facilitate training management
for personnel in maintenance-related career fields. MIS use is mandatory when available. The
MTF and or UTM are the Point of contact (POC) for functional administration of the MIS
training component.
4.1. (AFMC)Introduction. The AFMC MXWs authorized automated MIS will be TSS and
shall be used to manage training requirements in support of this instruction and other applicable
directives. HQ AFMC/A4D will be responsible for overall management and control and will
utilize the AFMC Portfolio Management (PFM) process for identification of new requirements
and system deficiencies.
4.2. Purpose. The MIS TBA provides authorized users with ready access to training related
information currently maintained in many different places and not readily accessible to those
who need the informa-tion. TBA will allow users to:
4.2. (AFMC)Purpose. This section does not apply to AFMC Depot Maintenance.
   4.2.1. Maintain configuration management of AFJQS, CFETP, and STS tasks.
   4.2.2. Maintain configuration management of ancillary and special training courses.
   4.2.3. Maintain workcenter MTLs and MTPs.
   4.2.4. Maintain individual training records (AF Form 623).
   4.2.5. Manage and track individual CDC enrollments.
   4.2.6. Manage and track individual training courses and tasks.
   4.2.7. Schedule and manage classes and events.
   4.2.8. Forecast training shortfalls.
   4.2.9. Predict Unit Type Code (UTC) training qualifications and shortfalls.
4.3. Administration. At wing level, the MTF and or UTM are the POC for functional
administration of the MIS TBA. Users will submit trouble reports to UTM or MTF. The UTM
will evaluate each trouble report to determine if the problem is software-related or related to lack
of user knowledge/training. If the UTM cannot resolve the trouble report locally, he/she will
forward it to MTF for resolution. If the MTF cannot resolve the trouble report, MTF will forward
the trouble/change request to either the COI, CFA, or to the MIS FCB as applicable. Forward all

training reports related to data/records in the system to the CFA. Additionally, maintenance
UTMs will conduct the AF Training Course using the MIS TBA (when available).
4.3. (AFMC)Administration. This section does not apply to AFMC Depot Maintenance.
4.4. User Roles. User roles will be assigned based on their position in the maintenance training
contin-uum. At wing level, the MXG/CC will appoint a set number of individuals who will have
authority to assign user level access/permissions in MIS TBA. The MXG/CC may delegate this
authority to the MTF Flight Commander/Chief. At the MAJCOM and numbered Air Force level,
the MAJCOM maintenance training manager is the approval authority for setting roles and
permissions. The AFCFM is the approval authority for setting roles and permissions at any other
level. Table 4.1. identifies the roles established in MIS TBA:

   will consolidate all MAJ-COM non-critical change requests for presentation to the CCB. The
   CCB will evaluate/approve/disap-prove non-critical change requests annually in conjunction
   with applicable U&TW and MATAG.
   4.8.2. Master Course Code Approval Process: Course additions, changes, and deletions
   identified as non-critical but time sensitive/critical: All aircraft related course code changes
   should go thru the Air-craft Lead command for concurrence on how that requirement is to be
   tracked Air Force wide. Prefor-matted request letters must be completed for each new request
   and forwarded to the MAJCOM representative for approval and submission to the MCT
   Manager. Immediate change requests of a crit-ical nature may be routed for e-mail approval
   from the requesting MAJCOM POC, thru all other MAJCOM POCs to HQ AF/ILMM for
   immediate approval and processing. If approved, these requests will be sent to the AF MCT
   Manager for processing/implementation.
   4.8.3. Master Course Code Waiver Process: AF/ILMM is the waiver authority for all local
   course codes to be used for local requirements tracking only. Local Requirements Tracking:
   Will be those requirements that only the submitting Unit/Base has a valid training
   requirement that must, by direc-tive, be tracked in an MIS. This valid training requirement
   must not be applicable to any other Unit/ Base/MAJCOM in order to be exclusively tracked
   locally. If it does apply to any other Unit/Base/ MAJCOM then the requirement, if valid,
   must be submitted as an MCT request for all users to have access to. Requests for waivers
   must be submitted through your MAJCOM representative to AF/ ILMM with full
   justification as to why the Unit/Base requires more local course codes than the preset limit of
   20 per base established by HQ AF/ILMM. If disapproved, AF/ILMM will return submission
   with justification for disapproval.

                      MAINTENANCE TRAINING FLIGHT (MTF)

5.1. General. The MTF is an MXG-level agency organized as a centralized aircraft
maintenance training function (Figure 5.1). However, UTMs should be physically located and
conduct their daily duties in the unit(s) they support. All Maintenance Instructors (MI) and
UTMs (AFSC 3S2X1) will be assigned to the MTF under the Maintenance Operation Squadron
(MOS) for administrative purposes. The centralization concept provides economy of scale and
standardizes maintenance training throughout the MAJCOM. UTMs will manage one or more
squadrons (if necessary). The MTF consists of the Training Management Section and
Development & Instructor (D&I) Section. These sections are subdivided into elements.
NOTE: Organizations that do not have a Maintenance Training Flight (MTF) will complete skill
training in the individual work centers (or Equivalent Training Function). Performance-based
activities (contrac-tors and MEOs) shall organize IAW AFI 38-203, and shall implement the
organization required in accor-dance with their contract or management plan. Chapter is not
applicable to ANG/AFRC units. ICBM units will organize MTF IAW with appropriate AFI 21-
2XX instructions.
5.1. (AFMC)Depot only) General. The MTF is a centralized maintenance training function
organized under the MXW which serves as the functional OPR for depot maintenance training-
specific regulations and supplements governing policy and compliance. Within the MXW,
training responsibilities are shared between the MTF and Group training offices. The GTMs will
be physically located and conduct their daily duties in the MXG they support. The MTF is the
MXW liaison for government, contractor, and all other training organizations and providers.
NOTE: Performance-based activities (contractors and MEOs) shall organize IAW AFI 38-203,
and shall implement the organization required in accordance with their contract or management
plan. (412 MXG/MTD only) The 412 MXG is organized under the AF High Performing
Organization (HPO) test program. MXG/MTD is an MXG-level agency organized as a
centralized aircraft maintenance training function. MTD structure, functions, personnel
assignments and duties are managed per the approved HPO Plan.
   5.1.1. The MTF is responsible for the functional management, utilization, control, and
   training of assigned 3S2X1 personnel. This structure provides the best possible environment
   to ensure the MTF can fulfill their responsibilities, support all MXG customer needs, and
   effectively manage, utilize, train and mentor assigned 3S2X1 personnel to be productive and
   progress within their career field. The overall responsibility for management of the MTF
   rests with the Flight Commander/Chief.
   5.1.2. Coordinate with Programs, Scheduling & Documentation (PS&D) function and the
   production supervisor or MOO/SUPT for selecting training aircraft. The MTF shall forward
   training requirements in a monthly format (including configuration and time periods) to
   Maintenance Operation Flight (MOF) PS&D by the end of the second week of each month
   for inclusion in the monthly maintenance schedule. Training requirements must be updated
   weekly and forwarded to MOF and Aircraft Mainte-nace Unit (AMU) PS&D for inclusion in
   the weekly maintenance plan. The MTF is responsible for scheduled maintenance training

                                    EN-ROUTE TRAINING

7.1. General. The En Route training program provides individuals with mission essential
training needed to meet the requirements of an assignment to short or long tour locations. En
route training provides weapon system training to aircraft maintenance personnel assigned to
units with equipment or systems unfamiliar to the personnel in transition, or have not worked the
system/MDS for 3 years (free-flow personnel). Training may be provided en route during
permanent change of station (PCS) via FTD, MQP/RTC, or flight line training. En-Route
training for long tour location is only authorized for tour lengths less than 3 years or if specific
courses are not available at that location (short tour locations will receive priority status over
long tour assignments).
NOTE: IAW AFI 36-2110, en route training is not authorized during intra-theater assignments.
This chapter does not apply to ANG/AFRC and ICBM Units.
7.1. (AFMC)General. Does not apply to civil service positions.
7.2. Establishing New En-Route Training Requirements. Each year units must submit
through the annual screening process an AF Form 3933, MAJCOM Mission Training Request,
through the MTF, to the parent MAJCOM to meet future en-route requirements, IAW AF/DPP
Mission Readiness Training (MRT) guidance in AFI 36-2201.
7.3. Establishing Sequential En-Route Requirements. Each year, units submit requirements
during the AF/DPP MRT annual (data call) process. Submit requirements through the local MTF
to the MAJ-COM Training Branch.
7.4. Factors to Consider When Scheduling En-Route Training. The Assignment Gains
Roster (or an automated product used to identify inbound personnel) is available from your local
Military Personnel Flight (MPF) or your unit.
   7.4.1. Initiate training requests at the beginning of the assignment cycle. Training requests
   initiated within 90 days of Military Personnel Flight (RNLTD) are considered late.
   7.4.2. Supervisors will use the following factors as a minimum in determining a person’s
   qualifica-tions:
       7.4.2.1. Training history (listed by three-digit, Personnel Data System (PDS)) code.
       (Translations for PDS codes are listed in Education and Training Course Announcements
       web page).
       7.4.2.2. Member’s duty history.
       7.4.2.3. SEI.
7.5. Canceling En-Route Training Request. When it is determined that an En-Route training
require-ment no longer exists, the MTF will notify the command functional training manager and
cancel the requirement.
7.6. Scheduling En Route Training. En route training will be scheduled based on the gaining
organization's need. All free-flow personnel should receive training on the new system/weapons
system prior to assuming their duties at the gaining location. This training can be in the form of
 68                                          AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010


OJT, but if a FTD course is available, the member must be scheduled to attend this course as
soon after arrival as possible. Personnel reporting to an OCONUS tour with a tour length of less
than 3 years will receive this training en route. Personnel reporting to an OCONUS long tour
(tour lengths 3 years or more) or CONUS tour will receive this training at the gaining duty
location. In cases where the training is not available at the gaining long tour or CONUS
location, personnel shall receive training en route prior to arrival.
   7.6.1. Gaining MAJCOM responsibilities. (Note: Component MAJCOMs can choose to
   exercise reach-back for training requests to Lead MAJCOMs)
       7.6.1.1. Coordinates with subordinate units to determine/identify training requirements
       for inbound personnel.
       7.6.1.2. Works with AFPC to establish PPC code requiring en route training for all
       maintenance positions at OCONUS locations for tour lengths less than 3 years.

                 MAINTENANCE QUALIFICATION PROGRAM (MQP)

8.1. General. Qualification training is ongoing, providing adequate skills to accomplish all
maintenance tasks required. Each MAJCOM will develop and implement a MQP to achieve
maintenance qualification training IAW AFI 36-2201. MQP training should be conducted in a
controlled environment that is not in competition with sortie production. MTF, TD, and ADL
courses can all be used to satisfy local training requirements. All MAJCOM MQPs will
incorporate a similar phased training process that meets the intent of processes identified in this
chapter.
NOTE: This chapter does not apply to ANG, AFRC and AFSOC Units. Specific qualification
require-ments for munitions, nuclear and missile activities are included in the appropriate AFI
21-2XX and AFI 21-114 series instructions and MAJCOM supplements.
8.1. (AFMC)General. AFMC does not have a training business process that matches. AFMC
Depot Maintenance’s maintenance qualification process is identified in AFI 21-101, AFMC
Supplement 1. 412 MXG military personnel maintenance qualification process is accomplished
per AFSC CFETP, and AFI 21-101, AFMC Sup 1. MQP does not apply to civil service
positions.
8.2. Phase I, Inprocessing, Maintenance Orientation and Maintenance Refresher.
   8.2.1. Inprocess to base, wing, squadron, and unit training/MTF.
   8.2.2. Maintenance Orientation: Personnel will attend orientation within 60 days after
   arrival.
   8.2.3. Maintenance Refresher: This is recurring training conducted as a follow-up to the
   maintenance orientation.
8.3. Phase II, Continuation Training (CT).
   8.3.1. Continuation training is a structured training phase that standardizes specific AFSC
   training requirements. It consists of four sub-phases (Multiphase, MAJCOM Mandatory,
   Freeflow, and Main-tenance Qualification Training). It is designed to provide task oriented
   hands-on training. Phase II enhances and complements initial skills training by providing
   hands-on weapon system training and experience. It is designed to train personnel to perform
   maintenance task unsupervised and unassisted. Continuation training courses should provide
   a smooth learning transition while providing a logical building block approach for job
   qualification.
       8.3.1.1. Phase II training can be used to supplement OJT and to provide skill-level
       upgrade, qual-ification, CUT, or familiarization training. Phase II students are attached to
       the MTF and TD dur-ing training, but are officially assigned to their respective gaining
       organizations.
   8.3.2. Multiphase Students.
       8.3.2.1. The term Multiphase identifies students who must complete AETC resident
       training and a follow-on TD AFSC-awarding course. Students are automatically
70                                        AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010


     scheduled for the AFSC-awarding course by 982 TRG at Sheppard Air Force Base
     (AFB).
     8.3.2.2. Students arriving at their end assignment should in-process as much as possible
     before the class starts. Obtaining a line badge should be the first priority.
     8.3.2.3. The squadron commander may allow Multi-phased students to return to the
     organization following the normal TD training day IAW AFI 36-2201. Students may be
     trained on tasks such as posting technical orders, support section functions, and other
     related items.
     8.3.2.4. Senior maintenance personnel will establish procedures to closely monitor these
     individ-uals. Constant supervision will be required since these personnel may not be
     sufficiently trained or aware of hazards associated with maintenance tasks.
  8.3.3. MAJCOM Mandatory Courses:
     8.3.3.1. The MMCL will be used to determine mandatory aircraft maintenance courses.
     All entry level Airmen Basic through the grade of Master Sergeant (7-level), who
     perform maintenance in a sortie producing and backshop AFSCs, are required to attend
     mandatory courses as identified in the course listing.
     8.3.3.2. The MTF and unit training manager will ensure personnel are scheduled to
     attend MMCL courses within 180 days (if course prerequisites are met) of assignment to
     squadron. If more than one course is required, the individual must begin each subsequent
     course within 180 days of com-pletion of the previous course. When personnel cannot be
     immediately entered into a TD course, the unit should schedule them for in-processing
     appointments or ancillary training. Any excep-tions to this paragraph will be noted in the
     MMCL.
     8.3.3.3. Phase I requirements will not interfere with students attending Phase II training
     courses.
  8.3.4. Freeflow students:
     8.3.4.1. Freeflow training is for personnel who are changing MDSs or who have not
     performed maintenance duty on the assigned MDS within the past 3 years.
     8.3.4.2. Personnel who are changing from one weapon system to another will attend the
     appropri-ate MMCL and MQT courses.
     8.3.4.3. All master sergeants and above with less than 1 year experience on the assigned
     MDS, who supervise maintenance personnel, will attend the appropriate TD
     familiarization course, if available.
     8.3.4.4. The MXG/CC may waive TD freeflow course requirements.
     8.3.4.5. Requests for waiver will be initiated by the squadron commander and forwarded
     to the MTF. The MTF Commander/Chief will forward recommendations to the MXG/CC
     for approval/ disapproval. Waiver requests will contain individual’s name, rank, primary
     AFSC, duty position, course to be waived, and a full justification of the request.
AFI36-2232_AFMCSUP_I 13 DECEMBER 2010                                                       71


       8.3.4.6. When a waiver is approved, the MTF scheduler will file a copy of the letter and
       forward the original to the squadron through the UTM. The UTM will update the
       individual’s automated training record using course status code "W‖.
   8.3.5. Maintenance Qualification Training (MQT). MQT consists of academic and practical
   hands-on training courses that complement AETC TD/MRA courses. MQT courses will not
   duplicate any 3c level task or behavioral objective that is taught by AETC or which requires
   the student to perform to a certified level (i.e., without error, without assistance, 80-100
   percent accuracy, etc.).
       8.3.5.1. MQT students are attached to the MTF for training, but are assigned to their
       gaining orga-nization. Students will complete all 3c task items from the course control
       documents at least once. MQT students will not be sent to the flightline until they are
       qualified on required tasks. Students who fail to achieve course objectives may be
       required to repeat all or part of the course. The squadron commander may remove a
       student from the MQT program for unsatisfactory progress. This individual will receive
       supervised OJT in their work center.
       8.3.5.2. The MTF will assess the need for MQT courses for graduates of MRA programs.
       If needed, a formal training program should be developed and implemented that teaches
       differences between assigned aircraft and training aircraft.
8.4. Phase III, Special Qualification Training (SQT).
8.4. (AFMC)Phase III, Special Qualification Training (SQT). Applicable SQT training
identified in the section are accomplished IAW AFOSH Standards, AFI 21-101, and local
supplements.
   8.4.1. SQT is any training program that does not fall under any other phase of MQP.
   8.4.2. SQT programs may apply to all personnel in a workcenter or only to those personnel
   assigned to a special duty. Examples of SQT courses are listed below:
       8.4.2.1. Engine Run Training Program.
       8.4.2.2. Test Cell Operation.

details on how to create course control documents for SOJT.
A3.2. (AFMC) SOJT Worksheet. All SOJT shall utilize an SOJT worksheet for evaluation
and documentation purposes. The SOJT worksheet identifies the conditions, behaviors and
standards that must be met for each learning objective and provides verification of training
completion through initials and signatures. The SOJT worksheet shall be used each time SOJT is
accomplished. The SOJT guide and worksheet will be established as a standalone document and
must be completed in its entirety. The worksheet format shown in Table A3.1. is for example
purposes. Similar forms can be used with the assistance of the MXW MTM to meet specific
training needs as long as the intent of all requirements is met as applicable.
A3.3. (AFMC) Employee completion of formal structured on-the-job-training is
documented by the SOJT Trainer on an SOJT worksheet. The SOJT Trainer submits the
completed worksheets to the trainee's supervisor, who verifies the completion information and
forwards completed form to the GTM for input into TSS /PAC/ETR. The GTM will retain
completed SOJT worksheets for a minimum of 12 months.
