This instruction implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning
and Execution. It outlines the 552d Air Control Wing (552 ACW) Chief of Plans (XPP) and
Chief of Wing Exercises (XPE) functions. Specifically, it outlines the process for development,
review and publication of operations plans (OPLANs), concept plans (CONPLANs), exercise
plans (EXPLANs), functional plans (FUNCPLANs), and associated planning documents. It
establishes XPE as the point of contact for Wing exercise planning. XPE will attend 72d Air
Base Wing (72 ABW) planning meetings and facilitate an exercise planning forum called
Warrior Team Meetings (WTMs). It also prescribes necessary unit actions to planning and
participating in Wing and Base exercises. This Instruction may be supplemented at any level,
but all supplements that directly implement this Instruction must be routed to 552 ACW/XPP for
coordination prior to certification and approval. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Information
Management Tool (IMT) 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s

applies to all units assigned to the 552 ACW that maintain operations plans or participate in the
development of operations planning documents. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units, except where noted otherwise.
