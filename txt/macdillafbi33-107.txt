This instruction implements AFPD 33-1, Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) Sys-
tems. It establishes responsibilities and outlines procedures for obtaining public address (PA) and presen-
tation support. The purpose of this instruction is to provide guidance to MacDill Air Force Base (AFB)
personnel on the capabilities and limitations of PA and presentation support provided by the 6th Commu-
nications Squadron (6 CS). This instruction applies to all units and/or personnel requesting PA and pre-
sentation support. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of prescribed processes according to
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule accessible on-line at https://webrims.amc.af.mil.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This revision combines (PA) and presentation support requirements into a single document for customer
ease. It describes the various types of PA and presentation systems available and explains the differences
between full and self-help support. Additionally, it designates the 6th Air Mobility Wing Commander (6
AMW/CC) as the final approval authority for non-routine requests and 6 CS/CC as approval authority for
routine requests. It better defines the responsibilities for providing PA and presentation support, and out-
lines procedures for customers to obtain PA and presentation support. Also, this revision lists the types of
events that can and cannot be supported in accordance with the Joint Ethics Regulation and identifies the
level of support available to each. Finally, it provides instructions for completing the revised MACDILL
AFB IMT 15, Public Address/Presentation Support Request, which incorporates PA and presentation
support onto a single request form. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.
