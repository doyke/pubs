This instruction implements Air Force Instruction 31-401, Information Security Program
Management, the requirements of DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and outlines
the 934 AW Information Security Program. It prescribes procedures and responsibilities of all
personnel working on Minneapolis ARS, MN; specifically Commanders; Security Managers
(SM); and Classified Account Custodians. 934 AW/IP provides oversight and assistance to all
934 AW units. Each Unit Commander is responsible for ensuring assigned personnel comply
with DoD 5200.1-R, AFPD 31-4, AFI 31-401, and this instruction. For the purpose of brevity,
the terms Unit and Squadron are interchangeable. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF

1. Program Management.
   1.1. Commander Responsibilities:
       1.1.1. Commanders are responsible for implementation of the Information Security
       Program within their respective area of responsibility. The SM manages the Information
       Security Program for the Unit.
       1.1.2. As the responsible officer in charge of the Information Security Program the
       Commander appoints a primary and alternate SM to manage the Information, Personnel,
2                                                        934AWI31-401 19 NOVEMBER 2009


       and Industrial Security Programs for the Unit. Larger Units are encouraged to appoint
       security monitors (in addition to the Alternate) to assist the SM. The primary SM must
       be a full-time employee/member of the unit. Continuity should receive serious
       consideration in the selection of security managers. Provide the appointment letter and
       any updates to 934 AW/IP.
       1.1.3. Ensure SM receives training within 90 days of appointment. This training will be
       conducted by 934 AW/IP.
    1.2. Security Manager Responsibilities:
       1.2.1. Maintain a security manager’s handbook. (Attachment 2)
       1.2.2. Mandatory attendance is required by primary or alternate security manager at the
       biannual hosted security manager meetings.
       1.2.3. HQ AFRC/SFI conducts Information Security Program Oversight Visits (ISPOVs)
       at AFRC installations every two years or in conjunction with Staff Assistance Visits
       (SAVs). 934 AW/IPs assist in the ISPOV.
           1.2.3.1. ISPOVs are assistance-orientated visits to identify noteworthy and problem
           areas in the Information, Personnel, Industrial, and NATO Security Programs. They
           must be extensive enough to determine overall status of the program and must include
           an assessment of the security education and training as a special interest item. Replies
           to ISPOV reports are generally not required; however, corrective action(s) taken to
           correct identified problem areas should be recorded.
       1.2.4. All units will conduct semiannual security self-inspections, one between 1 January
       and 30 June, and one between 1 July and 31 December. Self-inspections should be
       completed by a person knowledgeable of the Information Security Program (other then
       the SM). SMs should monitor the inspection, review the observations (if any) and follow
       up to ensure they are corrected.
       1.2.5. Print Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) rosters at least monthly.
       1.2.6. Security Container Listing.
           1.2.6.1. Develop a master security container listing and provide a copy to 934

           ID number, lock type (X-07, 08 or 09), physical location of the container, custodian
           information and date of last initial inspection or Preventive Maintenance Inspection
           conducted by the 934 CES Locksmith. If there is a secure room in the unit, enter the
           location, type of lock and custodian information.
       1.2.7. Ensure a visual aid identifying the SM and alternate is posted conspicuously
       throughout the Unit to ensure assigned personnel are aware of SM appointments.
2. Marking.
    2.1. Holders must notify originator of improperly marked documents in writing, or record
    with a memo any telephonic notification. Notification must be kept with the document.
934AWI31-401 19 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                     3


      2.1.1. All binders that contain classified information will be marked on the spine with the
      highest level of classified stored therein. Exceptions would be binders that are too small
      to have an adequate spine.
3. Safeguarding.
   3.1. Access
      3.1.1. Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) will be utilized to verify an
      individual’s access level. 3.1.2. In absence of verification of a signed SF 312,
      Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA), complete new form and forward to 934 AW/IP.
      3.1.2. 934 AW/IP may forward visit requests in the absence of security managers.
      3.1.3. Implement a documented accountability system (such as an inventory sheet) for
      Secret material retained over 30 days and stored in a General Services Administration
      (GSA) approved security container not located in a secure environment. The 934 AW/IP
      determines what constitutes a secure environment. Use an unclassified description of the
      material and file separately from the classified material. This will facilitate an assessment
      of a compromise.
      3.1.4. Use AF Form 614, Charge Out Record, or similar form, when a document is
      removed from a security container.
      3.1.5. Develop plans for the protection, removal, or destruction of classified material in
      case of natural disaster, fire, civil disturbance, terrorist activities, or enemy action. (DoD
      5200.1-R, para 6-303). Include in your unit operating instruction (see sample at
      Attachment 3).
      3.1.6. Each unit and staff agency which stores and processes classified information, do
      not have to use SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, or SF 702, Security Container Check
      Sheet, on security containers, vaults, or secure storage rooms where classified material is
      stored or handled when manned by cleared personnel on a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week basis.
      At no time under these conditions may the above be left unattended when opened.
      3.1.7. Include on your SF 701 (if applicable): Check all classified computers to ensure
      that the hard drive has been removed and locked in a GSA approved container. Check all
      Global Command and Control System (GCCS)/SIPRNET connections to ensure they
      have been disconnected and properly locked away. 3.1.8. Within AFRC, removing
      classified information/material from designated work areas for work at home is
      prohibited.
      3.1.8. AFRC installations must include designated overnight repository in their base
      supplement.
      3.1.9. The Security Forces Control Center (SFCC) and Command Post have been
      designated as the overnight repositories for the 934 AW.
      3.1.10. Classified Meetings and Conferences.
         3.1.10.1. Installation commanders can delegate this authority in writing to the 934
         AW/IP. The following procedures must be accomplished when hosting classified

           3.1.10.2. Verify security clearances on attendees prior to any classified briefings or
           discussions.
           3.1.10.3. Ensure the door to the discussion area is closed and someone is posted
           outside the door if sound attenuation and unauthorized entry is not adequate and
           cannot be controlled.
           3.1.10.4. Ensure the briefing is kept to need-to-know for those in attendance.
           3.1.10.5. Ensure classified is kept under constant surveillance. Use of classified
           cover sheets is required when material is removed from secure storage.
           3.1.10.6. Return all classified material to secure storage when not under personal
           observation and control.
           3.1.10.7. Note taking or electronic recording during classified sessions shall be
           permitted only when it is determined by the host that such action is necessary to
           fulfill the U.S. Government purpose for the meeting.
           3.1.10.8. Classified waste must be destroyed using approved methods (burning,
           melting, pulping, pulverizing, and cross-cut shredding).
           3.1.10.9. Ensure that classified documents, recordings, audiovisual material, notes,
           and other materials created, distributed, or used during the meeting are controlled,
           safeguarded, and transported as required by this instruction and DoD 5200.1-R,
           Information Security Program.
       3.1.11. Cellular phones, two-way radios, two-way beepers, and other electronic
       equipment that can receive and transmit a signal are prohibited in all offices and areas
       where classified and sensitive information may be discussed. Staff directors, NAF
       commanders, and wing commanders will determine which work areas are affected and
       implement this requirement accordingly. Owners of designated areas should make every
       effort to inform personnel of the prohibited use of electronic equipment, to include but
       not limited to posting signs and visual aids, and including the information in briefings
       and training, etc.
       3.1.12. Post visual aids at all machines (to include fax machines) approved for classified
       reproduction. At a minimum, post visual aids at all copy machines not authorized for
       classified reproduction. AFRCVA 31-404, Classified Reproduction Rules, and AFRCVA
       31-405, STOP Do not use this machine for classified Reproduction STOP, should be
       used. These visual aids may be obtained from the AFRC Publications web site.
4. Storage of Classified Materials [Reference DoD 5200. 1-R, Paragraph 6-402]

       hardware built after 1 October 1995 must have an intrusion detection alarm operating
       when appropriately cleared attendants are not present. 934 AW/IPs determine whether
       open or unattended storage areas provide adequate protection for classified material. If
       “security-in-depth” practices are used in lieu of alarms, the MAJCOM 934 AW/IP must
934AWI31-401 19 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                     5


       grant approval. Examples of “security-in-depth” are: use of perimeter fences, employee
       and visitor access controls, use of an IDS, random guard patrols throughout the facility
       during non-working hours, closed circuit video monitoring or other safeguards that
       mitigate the vulnerability of unalarmed storage areas and security storage cabinets during
       non-working hours.
       4.1.2. 934 AW/IP must send requests to waive any provisions of DoD 5200.1-R and AFI
       31-401 to HQ AFRC/SF for concurrence.           Post the storage facility approval
       notices/letters inside the approved area.

       5340-01-49-5776 = X-08 Container Lock
       5340-01-469-5897 = CD-X08 Combination Deadbolt lock for pedestrian doors with drill
       resistant plate
       5340-01-469-5906 = CD-X08 Combination Deadbolt lock for pedestrian doors with a
non-drill resistance plate
       4.1.4. Prior to storing classified information in a vault or secure room, the servicing civil
       engineer (CE) and the 934 AW/IP will survey the facility to determine if it meets the
       construction requirements outlined in DoD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7 and all other
       requirements of DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 for the storage of classified information.
       If the survey certifies that the facility meets requirements, the installation commander
       may approve the facility for storage of classified information. If the facility does not
       meet requirements, consider alternate or compensatory security controls in accordance
       with DoD 5200.1-R, Section C6.8. Re-evaluate all secure storage rooms every 5 years
       and accomplish new approval letter and/or waiver requests.
       4.1.5. Use of Key Operated Locks.
          4.1.5.1. Approve an area using key-operated locks to store bulky secret and
          confidential material according to paragraph 5.19.1, AFI 31-401.
