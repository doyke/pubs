                                           Chapter 3

      FLYING, OPERATIONAL, AND SPECIAL OPERATIONAL DUTY PROGRAM

3.1. Objectives and Desired Effects. The flying and other Special Operational Duty (SOD)
personnel program’s purpose is to optimize the health and performance of aircrew, space,
missile, Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), Presidential Support Directive (PSD), and other
SOD personnel in support of the operational mission of the AF.
3.2. Organization and Functions of the FOMC.
   3.2.1. Empanelment/population served.
       3.2.1.1. The FOMC empanels personnel who require maintenance of AF Form 1042,
       Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty and their respective
       dependents. Note: Even though 13Sx and 1C6xx AFSCs do not require an AF Form
       1042, they will be empanelled to the FOMC along with their respective families.
       3.2.1.2. Empanelment additions/deletions must be approved/disapproved by the
       MAJCOM/SGP after request by the MTF (RMU/GMU)/CC. Deviations may include
       enrollment of other operational support groups or personnel with specific occupational
       exposures determined by the SGP, necessary for successful completion of local
       aeromedical or installation mission.
       3.2.1.3. Members who are on PRP or PSD status will also be empanelled unless there is
       a stand-alone PRP/PSD clinic. (T-3) (See 3.3 PRP Element)
       3.2.1.4. The FOMC will see, but not empanel the following categories: (T-3)
          3.2.1.4.1. Active duty and civilian federal employees for occupational health exams,
          unless there is a stand-alone Occupational Medicine (OM) clinic.
          3.2.1.4.2. Initial flying, special operational duty and incentive flight physical exams.
       3.2.1.5. ARC RMU/GMU personnel only conduct the following exams and services:
       annual flying exams, initial flying or special operational duty physical exams, fitness for
       duty, occupational medical exams, Preventive Health Assessments (PHA) and incentive
       flight physicals. (T-0; US Code, Title-32)
       3.2.1.6. For ARC, Aerospace Medicine will provide occupational examinations only for
       military flying and special operational duty personnel.
   3.2.2. Staffing will be according to the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Flight Path and
   Unit Manning Documents. Note: This is not applicable to ARC.
       3.2.2.1. If sufficient active component AF FSs are not available, contract and/or GS
       flight medicine physicians (FMPs) may be utilized in the FOMC. A description of
       expected qualifications and type of work can be found on the AFMS Knowledge
       Exchange (Kx) under Aerospace Medicine Signed Documents.                  Granting and
       maintenance of credentials will require approval and review IAW AFI 44-119. SGPs will
       be part of the review process if he/she is not the clinical supervisor. ARC FSs who are
       actively credentialed in FOMC may utilize their credentials in FS offices while
       functioning as a contractor. ARC FOMC credentials must be maintained to allow
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   11


     continued function in FS contractor role as detailed IAW AFI 44-119, Medical Quality
     Operations.
     3.2.2.2. At bases with stand-alone Occupational Medicine (OM) clinics, FSs will work
     with OM clinic staff to maintain clinical competency regarding occupational health
     exams and industrial shop visits. (Not applicable for the ARC)
  3.2.3. Clinical Services Provided.
     3.2.3.1. FSs and Physician Assistants (PAs) will provide active component (and civilian
     federal employees who choose the AF as their medical care for occupational health
     exams) initial, annual, termination or special purpose occupational evaluations to include
     fitness for duty (FFD) examinations (FSs only) and medical surveillance examinations
     (MSE), unless there is a stand-alone Occupational Medicine (OM) clinic. (Not applicable
     for the ARC)
     3.2.3.2. FSs/PAs will provide preventive medicine services to mitigate travel-related
     health risks in empanelled populations and serve as MTF travel medicine consultants.
     ANG GMUs in Title-32 do not provide routine medical care, but ARC FSs provide
     appropriate medical prophylaxis and deployment counseling. They do not function as
     travel medicine consultants, except as related to deployments.
  3.2.4. FOMC Grounding Management. FSs review medical care provided outside the
  FOMC no later than the next duty day to render timely aeromedical disposition. ARC FSs
  in-garrison, should render the disposition as soon as possible, but no later than their next
  duty/drill day. Signed and dated aeromedical dispositions must be documented in the
  Airmen’s medical record and changes in status must be communicated to the member’s
  SQ/CC and Squadron Aviation Resource Manager (SARM) via AF Form 1042.
  3.2.5. Aircrew chemoprophylaxis ground testing. Rated and career enlisted aircrew will be
  offered ground testing with operationally required prophylactic medications (e.g.
  Ciprofloxacin) per the Official Air Force Aerospace Medicine Approved Medications list
  under supervision of a FS prior to completing initial aircrew training or as mission requires.
  Document results of testing (whether cleared for operational use or not) or members refusal
  to test IAW AFI 48-123.
  3.2.6. Medical evaluation and disposition following suspected ocular directed energy
  exposure. Note: Exposures to known directed energy sources previously deemed eye-safe by
  either AF or other competent United States (US) governmental authorities are exempt from
  these follow-up requirements.
     3.2.6.1. The Air Force Research Laboratory and School of Aerospace Medicine produce
     and maintain a Laser Injury Guidebook which has the most up to date recommendations
     for appropriate clinical work up and disposition. The most current version of the Laser
     Injury       Guidebook         located      on       the       AFMS        Kx        at
     (https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx4/FlightMedicine/Pages/operationalmedhomeapril2012.as
     px) and provides information for managing ocular directed energy exposure.
     3.2.6.2. Aircrew with persistent visual complaints or symptoms without objective
     findings will be placed in Duties Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status and referred to an
     eye specialist. Non-aircrew with persistent visual complaints or symptoms without
 12                                                        AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


      objective findings will also be referred to an eye specialist. (T-2) Specific duty
      restrictions may be warranted based on personal and operational safety concerns.
      3.2.6.3. Suspected ocular directed energy exposures must be reported to DoD Tri-Service
      Laser Injury Hotline; (800)-473-3549; (937) 938-3764; or DSN 798-3764. (T-1)
      3.2.6.4. Confirmed ocular directed energy exposures must be reported as at least as a
      Class E Physiologic event, or if appropriate, at a higher class level IAW AFI 91-204,
      Safety Investigations and Reports. (T-1). Notify BE to ensure they are able to meet
      requirements from AFI 48-139, Laser and Optical Radiation Protection Program, section
      3.6.
   3.2.7. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). FSs are the local clearance authority determining
   whether patients are clinically stable and physiologically ready for air transport. FSs will
   ensure proposed en-route treatment is appropriate and compatible with flight, IAW
   applicable guidance after consultation with the transporting/regulating authority.
3.3. Personnel Reliability Program/Presidential Support Duties Elements. Note: A PRP
element will be established to care for PRP certified members according to the current
established AFMS manpower standard. (T-1) The primary reference for the PRP is DoD
5210.42R_AFMAN 13-501, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP).
   3.3.1. PRP medical support staff should be assigned to the PRP stand-alone element or
   FOMC for a minimum period of 24 months to obtain the necessary proficiency. Rotations
   must be coordinated with the lead Competent Medical Authority (CMA), SQ/CC, and the
   respective functional manager. (T-2) Premature rotations (based on the needs of the AFMS
   and local mission) must be approved by the MDG/CC. (T-2)
   3.3.2. PRP medical support staff will be designated with Special Experience Identifier (SEI)
   IAW AFI 36-2101, section 3.13, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). (T-3)
   Note: ARC may award the SEI if the member meets the criteria, but it is not required as they
   do not PCS.
   3.3.3. The MTF (RMU/GMU) will ensure CMA contact information is provided to units
   with PRP personnel and to the Wing Command Post.
   3.3.4. Training.
      3.3.4.1. Assigned medical staff that directly supports PRP will accomplish AF
      Standardized PRP training IAW DoD 5210.42R_AFMAN 13-501. Additionally the Lead
      CMA will ensure all other medical personnel are trained to their appropriate level as
      directed within the MTF training slides.
      3.3.4.2. Lead CMA, primary/alternate CMA (if designated), and lead MTF (RMU/GMU)
      PRP monitor will attend the one-time USAFSAM Medical PRP Course for certification
      within six months of assignment to duty supporting PRP. This training is required prior to
      PCS for members going to OCONUS locations. The requirement for training before PCS
      may be waived by the MAJCOM/SGP, but the member will still require this training
      within 6 months or assignment to duty supporting PRP. (T-2)
3.4. Mission Essential Tasks And Line Support (METALS) supporting Flying and SOD
Personnel Program.
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   13


   3.4.1. METALS Matrix: The SGP will develop a local prioritized list of METALS and an
   annual execution and monitoring plan which must be submitted annually to the
   MAJCOM/SGP for review. (T-2) This plan will ensure all FSs meet both clinical and non-
   clinical requirements to include METALS and squadron support activities, and carries the
   intent that approximately 50% of the FS’s time is spent covering clinical workload and 50%
   accomplishing METALS and squadron operational support activities. Not all operational
   support activities exist or are of the same importance at each base due to different mission
   requirements. This should be reflected in the SGP’s annual plan. A sample list of common
   METALS can be found on the KX Operational/Flight Medicine Page. It is recommended the
   METALS list be completed as a matrix based on manning levels, i.e. lists which METALS
   would be planned to be complete if manned at 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% of FS manning.
   This allows everyone from the MAJCOM/SGP to the base level flight surgeon to understand
   the priority of effort
   3.4.2. Operational Inspections: All FSs (MTF (RMU/GMU)-based and SME) conduct
   operational inspections of agencies whose mission is support of aircrew such as: Aircrew
   Flight Equipment, control tower, alert facilities, radar approach control (RAPCON),
   parachute units, flying squadrons and space operations units. The frequency of visits is
   tailored to mission requirements. Each agency will be inspected at a minimum quarterly
   (annually for ARC) unless directed by regulation or other instruction. Minimum frequency
   may be waived by the MAJCOM/SGP.
   3.4.3. Medical Support for Installation Safety Program: FSs and Aerospace & Operational
   Physiology Training (AOPT) personnel must have access to AF Safety Automated System
   (AFSAS). (T-2)
3.5. SME Operations.
   3.5.1. Objectives: The SME is a line asset, which is integrated into normal FOMC operations
   while in-garrison, yet is available for deployment/exercise to the line commander as needed.
   3.5.2. SME composition is determined by Unit Manning Documents (UMD), but generally
   consists of one FS and two technicians:
      3.5.2.1. One FS, AFSC 48XX. Certified as medically qualified/acceptable for Flying
      Class II duties. FSs holding categorical waivers must be medically acceptable for their
      assigned Mission Designed Series (MDS) and must be medically qualified for worldwide
      duty. FSs with an Assignment Limitation Code (ALC) should not occupy an SME billet.
      (T-2)
      3.5.2.2. Enlisted composition will be IAW the UMD, usually one IDMT (4N0X1C) and
      one 4N0X1F or two IDMTs. If no IDMTs are available, MAJCOM/SG (or ARC/SG)
      may waive the AFSC requirements and substitute a 4N0X1F for the IDMTs. If no
      4N0X1F are available, then ARC/SG can substitute with 4N0X1.
          3.5.2.2.1. There will be one 7-level and one 5-level technician assigned. ARC
          technicians should hold at least a 5-skill level to perform SME duties while deployed.
          3.5.2.2.2. Technicians must be medically qualified for worldwide duty. Technicians
          with an ALC should not occupy an SME billet due to frequent deployment
          assignments. (T-2)
 14                                                         AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


   3.5.3. Performance Reporting.
      3.5.3.1. Reporting official for the SME FS will be the operational squadron commander.
      SME FS’s Officer Performance Reports (OPR) will flow up the line chain of command.
      If MTF (RMU/GMU) and line commanders concur, the rater can be the immediate MTF
      (RMU/GMU) supervisor. The OPR would return to the line chain for first and second
      level review/endorsement.
      3.5.3.2. The reporting official of enlisted SMEs will be the senior SME technician and/or
      SME FS. SME technician’s Enlisted Performance Report (EPR) flows up the line chain
      of command for review/endorsement. MDG 4N0 functional manager reviews draft EPRs
      for administrative correctness and provide comments on content. EPRs reflect the
      technician’s duty performance supporting the line unit, AME, and duties within the MTF
      (RMU/GMU).
   3.5.4. In-Garrison Operations. Note: ARC/SME does not perform clinical care in-garrison.
   Occupational examinations will occur in the RMU/GMU or MTF while in-garrison. These
   requirements apply to ARC providers and/or medical technicians assigned outside of the
   RMU/GMU.
      3.5.4.1. SME personnel must be fully integrated with the MTF (RMU/GMU) and work
      under clinical supervision of the SGP. SGPs coordinate with line chain of command to
      assign and manage professional duties of SME personnel ensuring that approximately
      50% of time is spent covering clinical workload and approximately 50% accomplishing
      METALS and squadron operational support activities.          Note: MAJCOM/SGPs can
      modify this requirement for specific subsets (i.e. CSARME) to meet operational needs.
      3.5.4.2. SME providers will maintain credentials with the MTF (RMU/GMU) and
      perform duties within the MTF (RMU/GMU) sufficient to warrant award and
      maintenance of privileges. (T-2)
      3.5.4.3. Enlisted SME personnel will maintain required skills noted in the Career Field
      Enlisted Training Plan (CFETP).
      3.5.4.4. SMEs with Independent Duty Medical Technician (IDMT) certification will
      meet rotational and medical skills maintenance training required for continued IDMT
      certification IAW AFI 44-103, The Air Force Independent Duty Medical Technician
      Program, for the duration of assignment as a SME.
   3.5.5. Deployed SME Operations. SMEs deployed to locations with a fixed MTF must
   identify themselves to the MTF commander or SGP. Clear lines of communication must be
   established and support requirements for SMEs identified. SMEs using fixed MTF services
   (pharmacy, lab, or other services) may be required to submit a credentials transfer brief and
   complete other administrative procedures IAW AFI 44-119.
3.6. Operational Medical Element (OME).
   3.6.1. Background: New and emerging technologies create work domains with unique
   human performance challenges. The communities of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA),
   Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and other Operators experience a high
   workload demand with continuous compartmentalized operations, a high cognitive demand,
   shift work fatigue and occupational stressors.
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     15


  3.6.2. The OME consists of medical personnel providing augmented medical, mental and
  occupational health support to unit personnel in addition to the regular medical service
  provided by their primary care teams. The support may include aeromedical dispositions and
  other medical support needed for accomplishment of unit operational missions. The concept
  of an OME is similar, but distinct from that of an SME. The goal is to improve access to care
  for “operators” that have challenges obtaining care from a traditional clinic-based system
  because of operationally based issues. One example is the ISR community where operations
  run on a 24/7 basis from a secured facility. Missing a shift may cause mission cancellation.
  Note: OME is different than AFSOC Ambulatory Care Units (ACU). See Chapter 10 for
  further guidance on medical functions embedded with line units and specific guidance on
  AFSOC ACUs.
  3.6.3. Objectives: Providers/extenders/technicians identify medical concerns early and either
  intervene at a level before patients symptom’s become clinically significant or facilitate
  patient entry into the traditional clinic-based health care when needing more advanced care.
  3.6.4. OME composition is currently determined on a case-by-case basis. Requests for an
  OME need to document the mission requirements that are currently not being met and
  whether the MTF/CC and the Operational Unit/CC are willing to allocate positions from their
  UMD to the OME concept. This request must be routed through the 25 AF ISR/SG or
  MAJCOM/SGP to Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA)/SG3P.
  3.6.5. OME at Sister Services Locations: Some AF ISR assets are located on non-Air Force
  installations or data-masked environments. At these locations the 25 AF-ISR/SG, ISR
  Wing/SG, Service Director of Medical Services, or MAJCOM/SG(P) will work with the
  facility medical installation to establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU). This
  MOU will establish the working relationship and clinical oversight responsibilities for the
  OME and the MTF.
  3.6.6. In-Garrison Operations: OME personnel are not expected to deploy in support of their
  operators. All of their support will be “in-garrison.” Similar to Aviation Squadron Medical
  Elements, providers should operate at a reduced Full Time Equivalent (FTE) standard with
  the expectation that the provider team spends up to 50% of their work time outside of the
  standard clinical setting. The out of office time will be spent interacting with Line personnel,
  advising the line commander and performing shop visits to better understand and support the
  occupational/operational stressors in these unique work areas. Note: ARC/OME must be in
  an active Title-10 status to perform OME duties for members in Title-10 status.
     3.6.6.1. OME personnel are only authorized to practice medicine IAW their local MTF
     (RMU/GMU) privileges as directed by AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations.
     Establishment of satellite clinics at the operational site must be coordinated with the host
     MTF commander and if established will meet all applicable requirements for a health
     care area (infection control, disposal of medical waste, etc.) and will be inspected with
     the MTF for compliance depending upon their scope of care. While the focus is primary
     and secondary prevention, when brief counseling occurs the patient care must be
     documented using the AF electronic health record (AHLTA) (T-2).
     3.6.6.2. OME personnel must be fully integrated with the MTF (RMU/GMU) and work
     under clinical supervision of the MTF. SGPs coordinate with line chain of command to
 16                                                           AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


       assign and manage professional duties of OME personnel to ensure they have the
       appropriate balance of clinical workload and direct support of operational activities. (T-2)
       3.6.6.3. OME providers will maintain credentials with the MTF (RMU/GMU) and
       perform duties within the MTF (RMU/GMU) sufficient to warrant award and
       maintenance of clinical privileges. (T-2) Privileged providers are responsible for all
       applicable Medical Staff Bylaws.
       3.6.6.4. Enlisted OME personnel will maintain required skills noted in CFETP.
       3.6.6.5. OMEs with IDMT certification will meet rotational and medical skills
       maintenance training required for continued IDMT certification IAW AFI 44-103, The
       Air Force Independent Duty Medical Technician Program.
3.7. Meetings: Where there is a separate AFI that details the expectations for a meeting, that
AFI must be referenced for details.
   3.7.1. Flight and Operational Medicine Working Group (FOMWG). The FOMWG will:
       3.7.1.1. Review weekly (monthly for ARC) the AF Form 1041, Medical
       Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty Log and recommend action on
       cases as needed. (T-3) AF Form 1041s are kept on file for five years then destroyed.
       Reference: AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
       3.7.1.2. Review Aeromedical Information Management Waiver Tracking System
       (AIMWTS) workflow data including new aircrew/SOD waivers, waiver renewals, and

                                           Chapter 7

                         HUMAN PERFORMANCE OPERATIONS

7.1. Night Vision Devices (NVD) Program Support.
   7.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, defines AF-wide training requirements for use of
   NVDs. AOP officers may become certified NVD instructors as part of the training team and
   assist in initial and refresher training.                FSs, AOP technicians and
   optometrists/ophthalmologists may become certified NVD instructors. Weapons-specific
   training and operational requirements are IAW applicable AFI 11-2-MDS series.
   7.1.2. The FS and/or AOPT personnel must be knowledgeable on basic visual issues: e.g.
   contrast, ambient lighting, color vision, etc., and work with local aircrew flight equipment
   technicians and aircrew on Laser eye protection, high contrast visor, ballistic eye protection,
   and aircrew spectacle equipment optimizing performance of war fighters. (T-2)
7.2. G-Awareness Continuation Training. FSs and AOP officers must have adequate training
(to include centrifuge qualification IAW AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew)
and be familiar with G-awareness continuation training requirements outlined in the respective
AFI 11-2-MDS series and AFPAM 11-419, G- Awareness for Aircrew. AFI 11-404 describes
the initial qualification, refresher centrifuge training requirements, and guidance and procedures
for handling aircrew that do not satisfactorily complete this training program.
7.3. Fatigue Countermeasures Program.
   7.3.1. A primary aim for FS, SMEs, and AOPT personnel is sleep hygiene, education and
   mitigation of effects of fatigue on successful mission completion. This is accomplished
   through advocacy, consultation with leadership, evaluation/analysis of threats, education,
   training, and use of approved fatigue countermeasure tools. FSs and AOPT personnel must
   be knowledgeable on AF guidance pertinent to mission and warfighters support. A
   mandatory starting point for supporting fatigue management in flying operations is AFI 11-
   202V3, General Flight Rules, Chapter 9, Crew Rest, Fatigue Management and Flight Duty
   Limitations. In addition, several platforms have guidance in Volume 3 of their respective
   AFI 11-2-MDS series. The publication, Warfighter Endurance Management During
   Continuous Flight and Ground Operations: An Air Force Counter-Fatigue Guide, is an
   excellent resource on fatigue management and can be found under Fatigue Management
   Information                 on                the               AFMS                   Kx:
   https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx4/FlightMedicine/Pages/operationalmedhomeapril2012.aspx.
   7.3.2. The FS and/or AOPT personnel must be involved in mission planning on missions and
   operations where fatigue is likely to be a factor. They compare mission profile with operator
   circadian rhythm identifying phases of flight/operation where fatigue may be a factor. They
   plan ways to prevent or mitigate effects of fatigue ensuring mission/operation success. For
   aerial missions, focus is specifically on the critical phases of flight: take off, refueling,
   operational engagements, and landing.
7.4. Fatigue Countermeasure Medications. Pharmacologic interventions are intended to be a
last resort when all other measures have been exhausted. The Aerospace Medicine community
has conducted a tremendous amount of research to find the safest medication to use, but they are
 22                                                           AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


NOT without risk, and should NOT be used in place of non-pharmacological interventions.
However, there are situations where the use of these medications is warranted by mission needs
and inability to sufficiently mitigate the risk with other measures.
   7.4.1. Approved Fatigue Countermeasure Medications (Go/No-Go Pills). AFMSA/SG3P
   will publish the list of authorized stimulants (Go pills) and sedatives (No-Go pills) that have
   proven to be effective and have the least risk with their use to mitigate fatigue in the Official
   Air Force Aerospace Medicine Approved Medications list. This does not constitute approval
   to use these medications without prior authorization from the MAJCOM (or higher) AND
   approval from the local SGP and Wing/CC (or equivalent).
   7.4.2. MAJCOM Specific Policy. Per AFI 11-202V3, Flying Operations, MAJCOMs will
   develop guidance on the use of fatigue countermeasure medications, specifically situations,
   exercises and contingencies where the use of Go Pills” could be authorized. This policy will
   list situations were Go Pills” could be authorized for use, but will still need local approval.
   7.4.3. Local Approval. If AF and MAJCOM policy allow the use of Go Pills” for a given
   situation, then the local Wing/CC or equivalent can make an Operational Risk Management
   decision about whether to authorize their use. The local authority should consult with the
   SGP to ensure other risk mitigation strategies have been considered.
   7.4.4. Flight Medicine establishes a program to ground test, dispense, and control
   pharmacological agents for fatigue management IAW AFI 48-123, AFI 11-202V3, and
   current AF policy. (T-2) Note: For ARC: Written plans must address the security, storage
   and distribution of controlled substances IAW AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support. (T-2)
   7.4.5. The SGP counsels, with the Go Pill approval authority (wing or deployed
   commander), the medical utility of using Go Pills for a particular mission or mission set. The
   SGP will ensure appropriate non-pharmacological fatigue prevention strategies and
   operational countermeasures are utilized prior to concurring with operational Go-Pill use. (T-
   2)
   7.4.6. Go/No-Go pill ground testing and operational use is voluntary. The FS offers ground
   testing for Go/No-Go pills to select eligible aircrew prior to use in an operational setting.
   Documentation of successful ground testing or deferral is entered in the medical record of
   eligible aircrew. All aircrew are “Duties not to include flying” (DNIF) while ground testing
   both Go and No-Go pills.
   7.4.7. Operational use of stimulants (Go Pills) and sedatives (No-Go Pills) are IAW
   MAJCOM supplements to this instruction: (ACC for Combat Air Forces (CAF), AMC for
   Mobility Air Forces (MAF), and AFSOC/CV policy letter for Battlefield Airmen), and the
   Official AF Aerospace Medicine Approved Aircrew Medications list. The designated
   MAJCOMs will coordinate supplement development/revisions with AF/SG3P. Caution:
   There is potential for Airmen using Go/No-Go Pills to become dependent on their use to
   the exclusion of all other non-pharmacological interventions. FSs must clinically
   supervise the use of any Go/No-Go medications and exercise careful judgment before
   dispensing. They are not intended to be a solution to manning shortages or to support a
   lifestyle of poor sleep habits or inappropriate prioritization of work and play activities.
   7.4.8. FSs provide eligible aircrew counseling regarding off label use of Go Pills as an
   operational countermeasure, and obtain informed consent as required prior to prescribing
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  23


   them IAW 10 USC 1107(f), Notice of Use of an Investigational New Drug or a Drug
   Unapproved for Its Applied Use. Informed consent is required only once for each Go Pill
   medication and dosage and must be documented in the Airman’s medical record. (T-2)
   Note: References and tools to provide this counseling can be found at the “Go Pills” link on
   the KX under Operational & Flight Medicine.
   7.4.9. FSs report operational use of Go Pills including adverse reactions during operational
   use to MAJCOM/SGP. A sample format to accomplish this can be found on the “Go Pills”
   link at the KX. The MAJCOM/SGP will maintain record of Go Pill use and provide annual
   summary to AFMSA/SG3PF.
   7.4.10. Eligibility for the operational use of pharmacologic sedatives (No-Go) requires
   appropriate ground testing and approval of the local FS. Aircrew will declare themselves
   DNIF after use of sedative for the specified time as annotated in the Official AF Aerospace
   Medicine Approved Medications list and as instructed by the FS. (T-1)
7.5. Custom Hearing Protection. Standard Ear Impression Technique (SEIT) for Attenuating
Custom Communication Earpiece System (ACCES) and similar devices.            Note: All logistic
support, ordering/receipt, routine maintenance and associated costs for training and materials
remain the responsibility of the requesting flying squadron / group / wing.
   7.5.1. Flight & Operational Medicine is the OPR for oversight of SEIT procedures for the
   ACCES and similar programs and will appoint a program manager to oversee SEIT if the
   wing supports such a program. The program manager will either be a flight surgeon or
   audiologist. (T-3)
   7.5.2. Only individuals who have completed appropriate SEIT training may create SEIT
   impressions and assess fit/comfort of ACCES or similar devices provided by the
   manufacturer. In order of preference, the following individuals should perform these duties:
   Audiologist, FS, IDMT (4N0X1C) or 4N0X1F, Nurse, or AOP personnel (43A3 or 4M0X1).
   All personnel except audiologists must complete the manufacturer's SEIT training before
   performing these duties. (T-3)

      EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS

8.1. Organization and Functions. The MTF (RMU/GMU) Medical Contingency Response
Plan (MCRP) supports an Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP 10-2) IAW AFI 10-
2501, and AFMAN 10-2502. FOMC personnel must be familiar with the MCRP and their roles
within the plan. (T-2)
Note: For ARC, refer to Installation Emergency Management Plan (10-2) and AFI 10-2605,
AF Incident Management System, and the Mass Casualty Response Plan (MCRP).

Note: Not all ARC units will have their own MCRP, but must be familiar with their role to
support their host MCRP.
8.2. Essential Functions. Note: This is not applicable to the ARC.
   8.2.1. First Responders: The FOMC will maintain emergency responder capability
   supporting installation flying operations and coordinate with other available first response
   capabilities.
   8.2.2. First responders provide initial on-scene command. The first medical responder to an
   incident must co-locate with senior Fire and Police/Security commanders and/or Incident
   Commander (IC) as the Medical Advisor (MA) and be clearly recognizable. Further medical
   personnel arriving on scene must report to the MA for instructions if not previously
   communicated. The MA should be the most senior/experienced medical person on-scene.
   The role of the MA should be transferred upon the arrival of a more experienced medical
   responder depending on the circumstances of the incident and the expertise required. The
   MA is typically the most senior/experienced FS.
   8.2.3. Transport: FOMCs support airfield operations responding to a variety of in-flight
   emergencies and airfield incidents. The type of vehicles required and the ability to respond
   adequately depends on the type of aircraft assigned and the spectrum of aircraft that visit the
   airfield. Installation location, mutual-aid response capability, and proximity to definitive
   care are factors that must be considered. These parameters form the basis of a risk
   assessment conducted by the SGP to determine level and adequacy of emergency medical
   response. Emergency Transport response time must meet the requirements in DoDI 6055.06
   , DoD Fire Emergency Service Program, Table E3. T1, minimum level of service objectives-
   operations section under Emergency Medical. (T-0)
   8.2.4. A transport vehicle must be able to transport a minimum of two first responders, one
   FS, and medical equipment/supply packs to any crash site within a 10 mile radius of the
   airfield over rough terrain. (T-2)
   8.2.5. Medical vehicle drivers responding to in-flight emergencies and airfield incidents
   must have a valid flight line drivers permit and be proficient with flight line driving during
   both day and night operations.
   8.2.6. First Receivers: Some locations require the FOMC to have first receiver capability.
   This must be staffed with medical personnel with ATLS or pre hospital trauma life support
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    25


   (PHTLS) qualifications and knowledge of the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS).
   (T-2)
8.3. Specialized Response. Note: There are no full-time providers at most ARC RMU/GMUs.
Injured ARC members are transported to facilities as clinically appropriate. In no circumstance
should an injured member bypass a civilian Emergency Room/Trauma Center in favor of an AD
MTF unless the member is clinically stable and the delay is not expected to impact patient
outcome.
   8.3.1. FSs provide medical oversight and emergency response to physiological and/or
   medical incidents resulting from hypoxia (i.e. altitude chamber or Reduced Oxygen
   Breathing Device (ROBD)), and/or centrifuge training as applicable for units with this
   training mission. During all scheduled training events, a designated flight surgeon must be
   able to continuously respond by telephone and get to the training facility in the timeliest
   manner possible. (T-1)
   8.3.2. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive (CBRNE) / HAZMAT
   Response:       FOMC personnel must have correctly fitting personal protective
   equipment/individual protective equipment (PPE/IPE) appropriate for their specific team
   responsibility and have exercised using the equipment while performing their duties prior to
   responding. (T-2)
   8.3.3. Disaster Response. FOMCs must develop relationships and demonstrate familiarity
   with plans that include coordination with local emergency services and an understanding of
   integration with these agencies to support their missions under the IEMP/MCRP. (T-2)
   8.3.4. Aircraft Mishap Response: FOMCs must review AFI 91-204, Safety Investigation
   and Reports, and the Aircraft Mishap portion of the MCRP and ensure they are able to
   execute their responsibilities per IEMP/MCRP. Critical elements include:
       8.3.4.1. Initial Response: site safety, treatment of injured, initial collection and
       preservation of evidence. Note: Strong consideration should be given to sending any
       aircrew member that has undergone an ejection seat sequence to local Emergency
       Room/Trauma Center even if they report no or only minor injuries.
       8.3.4.2. Evidence preservation/collection as directed by the interim Safety Board (ISB)
       President, usually a member of Wing Safety (SE).
       8.3.4.3. Identify a local FS for the ISB, per base plan. The FS’s primary duty is based on
       ISB requirements until released.
       8.3.4.4. Sequester associated healthcare records (medical, dental, MH) until requested by
       the ISB or follow on Safety Investigation Board (SIB).
       8.3.4.5. Obtain 72-hour and 14-day histories.
       8.3.4.6. Obtain required toxicology and other relevant tests IAW AFI 91-204, section
       2.7.4. Extent of testing depends on the nature of the mishap. Consult SGPs, Armed
       Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES), and the AF Safety Center FSs as needed.
       8.3.4.7. The FOMC ensures proper aeromedical dispositions are accomplished for
       mishap personnel on flying/SOD.
 26                                                          AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


      8.3.4.8. Notification   of   medical    leadership    (SGP,    SQ/CC,     MDG/CC)       and
      MAJCOM/SGP.
      8.3.4.9. Mishap kits must be developed, maintained, and appropriately resourced. FOMC
      personnel must train and be familiar with the kit. FOMC personnel must review mishap
      response plans and inventory the mishap kit every six months at a minimum. (T-2)
      8.3.4.10. FOMCs will ensure and be familiar with written agreements with local
      coroner/medical examiner which governs possession of remains after aircraft mishap.
      This agreement should include authority to have a FS present at autopsies, and detail
      requirements for collection of AF mishap related specimens. (T-2)   Note: OCONUS
      sites will coordinate with MAJCOM ensuring this requirement is met under applicable
      Status of Forces Agreement.
   8.3.5. In-Flight Emergencies (IFEs): FSs must be familiar with the management of routine
   in-flight emergencies, especially physiologic incidents. FSs must meet aircraft after in-flight
   emergencies with a physiologic incident to identify causes of symptoms and assess and
   document the need for aircrew examination and/or treatment.     Note: This does not apply to
   ARC while in-garrison.
      8.3.5.1. A FS must be available (On-Call) for in-flight emergency coverage during
      scheduled flying hours. Note: This is not applicable for ARC.
      8.3.5.2. FSs must respond to IFEs when requested by Fire Chief/Wing Safety/Supervisor
      of Flying (SOF) and where there is a risk for physiologic incident including G induced
      loss of consciousness (G-LOC), hypoxia, aircrew disorientation, altered mental status,
      loss of cabin pressure at >20,000 ft., rapid decompression, smoke and fumes, or other
      physical symptoms or injuries reported by the aircrew. ARC units without local full time
      flight surgeon support may need to send the patient for civilian evaluation if there is no
      flight surgeon available to evaluate the member.
8.4. Training: First responders must be trained and equipped for immediate response to
expected hazards and environmental conditions. (T-2)
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  27

                                           Chapter 10

                        LINE EMBEDDED MEDICAL CARE UNITS

10.1. Purpose: This instruction provides guidance for the establishment and function of in-
garrison operational Ambulatory Care Units (ACUs) associated with Special Operations Forces
(SOF) and other embedded health providers. ACUs are associated with Operational Support
Medical (OSM)/Special Operations Forces Medical Element (SOFME) and Special Tactics
Squadrons (STS). OSM/SOFME support Special Operations Squadrons (SOS) flying squadrons,
while the STS are the supported ground forces. ACUs are medical assets embedded within
AFSOC line units. This guidance is intended to define the relationship and interactions between
Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and line unit medical elements with regard to in-garrison
embedded medical operations.
Note: This chapter is specifically applicable to AFSOC Ambulatory Care Units, but the concepts
and requirements are applicable to other health care providers embedded with line units.
10.2. Background: For several years, Special Operations Forces (SOF) have utilized embedded
medical assets to work in close proximity to the warriors. These embedded medical assets have
historically included flight surgeons, physician assistants, IDMTs, physical therapists and
operational psychologists. Due to high operations tempo and unique physical and emotional
stressors, Special Operations Command (SOCOM) established an initiative called Preservation
of the Force and Family (POTFF). The POTFF initiative is an attempt to overcome SOF
reluctance to seek medical care and an even greater reluctance to seek mental health care by
these warriors. The course of action guided by the POTFF initiative is an expansion of the
embedded medical assets as well as the creation of several new non-privileged, non-medical
positions to assist the SOF in managing the stressors particular to their profession. These actions
can be applied to other operational communities that have similar stresses and needs.
10.3. Concepts: While any type of privileged or non-privileged provider could be embedded
with a line unit, there are some restrictions for POTFF providers. All POTFF assets are contract
personnel. Privileged POTFF providers may include: licensed clinical social worker; clinical
psychologist; operational psychologist; sports dietician; and physical therapist. Non-privileged
POTFF may include: psychiatric technician; nurse case manager family life assistant; family
support coordinator; athletic trainer; human performance advisor; strength & conditioning
specialist and sports psychologist (unless they possess the credentials to be privileged as clinical
psychologists IAW 44-119) (T-2); and data analyst. All or some of these may further be
incorporated into other embedded healthcare units (OSM/SOFME, SME, OME) making the
ACU/embedded unit a combination of DHP-funded active component, and Line-funded
personnel. All privileged providers must be appropriately privileged through their host MTF
prior to performing any medical duties. All non-privileged providers must meet credentialing,
education, and training requirements commensurate with their specialty standard of care prior to
performing their function. (T-2) The advantages of this care model include improved access to
care, enhanced understanding by the providers for the unique nature of SOF/operational mission
and operations tempo, and increased trust resulting in an improved patient-provider therapeutic
relationship. The fundamental concept is that services by these medical and non-medical assets
are provided in-garrison but outside the MTF. These units are designated areas within Line unit
 32                                                         AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


spaces where care is provided to active component personnel ONLY. Although ACUs are not
considered a component of the MTF, they rely on support from the local MTF.
   10.3.1. This instruction is not intended to preclude embedded medical assets from caring for
   patients in the MTF. This policy is intended to establish the framework under which care
   may be provided outside of the MTF. All reference to the ACUs refer to care provided
   outside of the MTF. Care inside the MTF, and MTF operated locations, will be managed
   under guidance in place for the MTF.
   10.3.2. Each base should review assigned medical assets and work between the Line and
   medical organizations to determine utilization of Defense Health Program (DHP)-funded and
   line-funded medical assets.
   10.3.3. ACU policy at sister-services locations: Some AFSOC assets are located on non-AF
   installations. At these locations, the SOW/SG or GROUP /SG will work with the facility
   medical installation to establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU). This MOU will
   establish the working relationship and clinical oversight responsibilities for the ACU and the
   MTF.
   10.3.4. POTFF privileged providers will typically provide care in ACUs but may
   occasionally provide care in the MTF. Any care, counseling, or interaction provided to
   dependents by POTFF providers will take place in the MTF only, in which case they will
   adhere to all AF MTF oversight, privileging and standard of care guidance. (T-2)
   10.3.5. Accreditation: In accordance with DoDI 6025.13, Medical Quality Assurance
   (MQA) and Clinical Quality Management in the Military Health System (MHS), all fixed
   MTFs shall meet or exceed the standards of appropriate external accrediting bodies.
   However, Operational Healthcare Units (not a component of an accredited MTF and treating
   active component personnel only), such as line-embedded medical assets described here, are
   exempt from the accreditation requirement. This guidance establishes a template for
   comparable quality-of-care oversight mechanisms for AFSOC ACUs. At a minimum, the
   functions of credentialing, risk management, patient safety and clinical performance
   improvement shall be included in the quality-of-care oversight mechanisms. ACUs will be
   inspected concurrently with compliance inspections for the MTF, and may be a separate
   graded area on the MTF report. (T-0)
10.4. Structure of SOF Embedded Medical Assets:
   10.4.1. Ambulatory Care Unit (ACU): ACUs are located in (SOSs) and Special Tactics
   Squadrons (STSs). The types of providers assigned to each ACU vary based on need. The
   intent of the ACU is to provide resiliency resources in the form of medical and mental
   healthcare to SOF where the operators are located. POTFF medical assets will primarily be
   assigned to STS. However some POTFF assets will be placed at SOS units, as well as the
   Special Operations Wing (SOW) and Special Tactics Group (STG).
   10.4.2. Special Operations Forces Medical Element (SOFME): SOFME is an element of the
   Operational Support Medical (OSM) and functions in a Special Operations Squadron (SOS).
   The SOFME typically refers to the flight surgeon and other members, that might include a
   physician assistant (PA), operational mental health provider, physical therapist and an IDMT.
   The primary responsibility of SOFME personnel is to provide aerospace medicine, primary
   care, and preventive medicine for AFSOC aircrew and special duty personnel in deployed
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  33


   and in-garrison environments. SOFME medics may also provide care in ACUs while in-
   garrison. The SOS ACUs may be made up of OSM assets and POTFF assets. POTFF assets
   in this situation are part of the ACUs and are members of the SOS but are not part of the
   OSM. Therefore the OSM providers, functioning in the SOS ACU, will have operational
   control over the POTFF ACU providers but not administrative control.
   10.4.3. Special Tactics Ambulatory Care Units (ST ACU): ST ACUs are designed to
   provide embedded medical care to SOF ST units. ST ACU assets are funded from DHP
   sources (for a minority of the active component assets) and non-DHP sources (through
   POTFF/MPF-11). The STS has administrative and operational control for all ST ACU
   providers. (T-2)
   10.4.4. Clinical leadership in the STS and the SOS is provided by the senior physician
   overseeing the STS ACUs or SOS ACUs. In ST ACUs, the senior physician is the SOW/SG
   or the GROUP /SG. For SOS ACUs, the physicians are assigned to the SOSS and their
   senior physician is the OSM flight commander (OSMFC). If the ST ACU is located at a base
   with a collocated SOW, the senior physician is assigned to the Wing, identified as the
   SOW/SG. If there is no SOW collocated with the ST ACU, the senior physician for that
   ACU is the GROUP/SG. The senior clinician for an ST ACU in this document will be
   referred to as the SOW/STG SG. The SOW/STG SG and the OSM FC have the same
   responsibility for clinical oversight for the ACU assigned under their purview. ST ACU
   providers will provide clinical oversight of the POTFF ACU providers and fall
   administratively under the STS as noted above. (T-2)
10.5. Funding: Embedded ACU POTFF providers are funded through Special Operations Line
sources as part of the Preservation of the Force and Family (POTFF) initiative. Funding needed
for embedded active component medical staff will be provided primarily through Major Force
Program-11 (MFP-11) sources. Non-disposable ACU medical supplies and equipment are
funded using Line sources, and day-to-day disposable medical supplies are funded through DHP
sources. The MTF should assist with ordering and procuring of medical equipment/supplies as
needed so they can retain visibility on orders and determine capability of Biomedical Equipment
Technicians (BMTS) to provide maintenance. ACUs are required to maintain both property and
supply custodians appointed in writing for tracking of supplies & equipment and are responsible
for pickup of equipment/supplies ordered for their ACU from the MTF. (T-3) Funding for ACU
staff for TDY, to include any Continuing Medical Education (CME), will be line funded. AFIT
funding for CME TDYs may be available for active component providers. The local MTFs’
Education and Training Flight will assist ACU providers with processing AFIT funding requests
if slots come available.
10.6. MAJCOM-level Guidance: AFSOC/SG develops policy guidance in support of AFSOC-
specific embedded medical assets with the coordination of AF/SG3.
   10.6.1. Contract Oversight: All contracts for embedded ACU POTFF assets will be
   managed by Line contracting office representatives (COR). Local MTFs will not be
   responsible for any aspect of non-medical ACU contracts.
   10.6.2. The local AFSOC Line Commander will supply space suitable for ACU patient care.
10.7. MTF Responsibilities:
34                                                          AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


  10.7.1. Clinical Oversight: The Medical Group Commander (MDG/CC) or equivalent
  ultimately has responsibility for, and authority over, professional supervision of medical care
  provided by all medical providers for that base as well as all embedded medical providers
  including but not limited to the 48Xs, 46Xs, 42Xs, 4Xs, and 2Xs. The work provided by the
  non-medical POTFF ACU consultants is overseen by the line squadron chain of command
  and detailed in AFSOC policy guidance. The MTF/CC, SGH, SGP, or other MTF personnel
  have neither oversight authority nor responsibility for the actions or results of these non-
  medical consultants. Day-to-day SOF ACU clinical oversight is delegated to the SOW/STG
  SG, OSM FC, or the senior active component, line-owned, flight surgeon in the chain of
  command, in coordination with the local MTF SGH and SGP. If no local, line, active
  component, group-level or OSM flight surgeon is available, the squadron level line flight
  surgeon will assume oversight responsibilities in coordination with the MTF. (T-3)
  10.7.2. Credentialing and Privileging: The local Military Treatment Facility Commander
  (MTF/CC) will assume all credentialing and privileging responsibilities for ACU privileged
  providers. Eligible ACU providers will be privileged as affiliate staff members. Medical
  care will only be accomplished by appropriately credentialed and privileged providers. (T-3)
  ACU contract positions should include review through the Credentials Office early in the
  hiring process to avoid delays.
     10.7.2.1. Education and Training (E&T): ACU providers will be tracked by the MTF
     Education & Training function in the same manner as similar providers assigned to the
     MTF. Education & Training will assist ACU providers with training requirements, but it
     is ultimately the responsibility of the provider to maintain currency with required
     training. Failure of any embedded provider to remain current in all required training
     activities and to provide E&T with proof of training currency will result in E&T making
     contact with the MTF SGH, SGP and the owning line commander who will assist with
     obtaining compliance. (T-3) MTF coding experts, if available, should provide guidance
     as requested by embedded providers or should reach out to embedded providers when
     coding education is deemed necessary.
     10.7.2.2. Readiness Training: Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP) is
     described in AFI 41-106. ACU providers’ RSV tasks will be monitored by their line unit.
     Each ACU provider is responsible for ensuring their own RSV currency. The responsible
     G-series commander is ultimately responsible to ensure readiness requirements are
     completed.
     10.7.2.3. Electronic Health Record/Medical Information Systems (AHLTA, CHCS,
     ASIMS, etc.) Support: MTFs will support ACUs in obtaining access to appropriate
     medical information systems, to include working with base communications. This
     includes assistance with obtaining access at line unit ACUs remote to the MTF. The
     MTF Medical Information Systems Flight will act on letters of request from line units for
     access to medical information systems.
     10.7.2.4. Medical Equipment Maintenance: Maintenance of ACU medical equipment
     will be accomplished by MTF Biomedical Equipment Technicians (BMETs). BMETs
     will prioritize line medical equipment as they would similar MTF equipment.
  10.7.3. Chief of Medical Staff (SGH):
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    35


     10.7.3.1. Has oversight of the professional staff management program, professional
     practice review, patient safety, health risk management and performance improvement
     activities that occur at the ACU. (T-3)
     10.7.3.2. Clinical Performance Improvement: Clinical Performance Improvement
     activities are via peer review and clinical oversight by the SGH (or SGH designee) and
     SOG/STG SG or OSM FC, and Line group or squadron senior flight surgeon. Other
     clinical Performance Improvement initiatives may be directed by the MTF or senior ACU
     flight surgeon. These will be tracked to completion by the senior ACU flight surgeon and
     reported to the MTF Quality Office.
     10.7.3.3. Peer Review:
        10.7.3.3.1. MTF/SGH and SOW/STG SG or OSM FC are jointly responsible to
        ensure peer review activities are being completed on ACU providers. (T-3) Failure
        of the ACUs to ensure completion of quality assurance activities, such as peer review,
        is elevated to the SOW/STG SG, OSM FC or above. The SOW/STG SG or OSM FC
        (senior active component line flight surgeon or PA for locations without a collocated
        SOW/STG SG or OSM FC), will forward monthly peer review results to the local
        MTF/SGH or SGH designee. If there is no local AF SGH at an ACU location, the
        SOW/STG SG or OSM FC will forward the peer reviews to the person most closely
        filling the role at that location.
        10.7.3.3.2. Mental Health Peer Review. Peer reviews will be accomplished IAW the
        AF Primary Behavioral Health Care Services practice manual (for providers seeing
        patients in ACUs) and established MTF policy. (T-3)
     10.7.3.4. Self-Assessments: ACUs will undertake self-inspections as directed by AF
     Inspection Agency (AFIA) guidance and instructions and enter their findings into the
     approved AFMS Self-Assessment Tool (i.e. MICT). Entries will be reviewed and
     approved by the SOW/STG SG or OSM FC as applicable. Line medical element, (and
     above), leaders will perform a self-inspection within 60 days of assuming the leadership
     role. This self-inspection will consist of all applicable self-assessment checklist elements
     as well as any other associated self-inspection items. (T-3)
     10.7.3.5. The SGH ensures Patient Safety Reporting (PSR) is available to providers in
     each ACU. MTF Patient Safety assists with PSR training, reporting, and tracking, and
     may also assist with other Patient Safety initiatives in the ACUs.
     10.7.3.6. SGH works with the MTF Medical Information Systems staff, in coordination
     with MTF Quality staff, to provide data to ACU clinical leadership, SOW/STG SG or
     OSM FC, regarding unsigned orders, incomplete encounters, results pending review, and
     other quality items consistent with similar reports on MTF providers.
     10.7.3.7. Risk Management: The local Healthcare Risk Manager (RM), with oversight
     from the SGH, provides a review of clinical activities of ACUs and submits a report of
     findings to the senior ACU flight surgeon and the MTF/SGH. The RM reviews take
     place within three months of the initiation of provision of care at the ACU and annually
     thereafter. RM reviews and ACU senior flight surgeon responses to findings are
     forwarded to the SGH, the SOW/STG SG or OSM FC, and the AFSOC/SGP. (T-3)

   10.7.4. Chief of Aerospace Medicine (SGP):
      10.7.4.1. Acts as liaison between ACUs and the local MTF.
      10.7.4.2. Provides expert advice and training as needed to ACU providers on all aspects
      of aerospace medicine, and consults on quality control for all aspects of care provided to
      aircrew and special duty personnel.
      10.7.4.3. Facilitates coordination between the MTF PHA Cell and ACU to ensure that
      ACU providers have the information necessary to complete PHA activities IAW AFI 44-
      170.
10.8. SOW/STG SG or OSM Flight Commander:
   10.8.1. Develops ACU supplemental policy for day-to-day management of ACU clinical
   staff. Policy will be implemented by SOW/STG SG and OSM FC. At locations where the
   SOW/STG SG or OSM FC is not collocated with the ACU, policy will be implemented by
   the senior SO physician or PA under the guidance of the SOW/STG SG or OSM FC.
   10.8.2. Determines optimal process for utilization of ACU clinical resources.
   10.8.3. Monitors clinical performance of ACU clinical staff and coordinates with local
   MTF/SGH to enhance quality of care and ensures appropriate remediation if there is concern
   regarding quality of care (as per AFI44-119).
   10.8.4. Monitors and addresses privileged providers’ response to applicable MTF directives
   and medical staff bylaws. The local MTF will work with the senior line flight surgeon to
   ensure compliance with the intent for ACU providers to attend Prostaff and other assigned
   MTF functions. The MTF will maintain an active list of ACU providers and ensure they are
   invited to MTF activities. (T-3)
   10.8.5. Ensures AHLTA/CHCS/ASIMS access for ACU providers. The SOW/STG SG or
   OSM FC, or the senior line flight surgeon, when the SOW/STG SG or OSM FC is not
   located at the same installation, will work with ACUs to determine a list of computers and
   the primary users of these computers, which will require AHLTA/CHCS/ASIMS. The intent
   is to balance access for users against the expense and risk inherent with excessive installation
   of AHLTA/CHCS/ASIMS. The SOW/STG SG or OSM FC, or senior flight surgeon will
   forward the request to the person designated by the local MTF for action regarding
   AHLTA/CHCS/ASIMS access requests.
   10.8.6. Ensures ACU representation at the MTF grounding management activities.
   10.8.7. Coordinates with the MTF PHA Cell to ensure ACU providers have the information
   necessary to complete PHA activities IAW AFI 44-170.
10.9. ACU Providers:
   10.9.1. ACU privileged providers are designated as affiliate staff, but should attend Prostaff,
   AF Form 1041 log review meetings, and other MTF Aerospace Medicine meetings to the
   maximum extent practical. Although ACU providers’ line taskings are separate from MTF
   taskings, ACU providers are still responsible for all applicable Prostaff content. (T-3)
   10.9.2. ACU providers will adhere to all guidance applicable to AF providers to include
   local Medical Staff Bylaws.
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     37


10.10. Staffing and Empanelment:
   10.10.1. Empanelment: ACU patients will remain empanelled to MTF providers and will
   not be empanelled to ACU providers. The ACU providers will, whenever possible, perform
   most functions of the PCM, to include Preventive Health Assessments (PHA), profiles,
   Medical Evaluation Boards (MEBs), Deployment Health Assessments (DHA), aircrew
   waivers, aircrew grounding management, and other tasks typically performed by the PCM.
   10.10.2. Staffing: Staffing for ACUs is requested by AFSOC/SG and line leadership with
   input from the host MTF Commander. Exact composition of the AFSOC ACUs will vary
   based on unit and mission.
       10.10.2.1. Physical Therapists (PTs): Patient treatment modalities may include: ice,
       heat, ultrasound, myofascial manipulation, range of motion and weight training. Other
       clinical activities may be provided as per the individual PT’s privilege list. PTs may
       function within an ACU and/or within an MTF. Location of care provided will be
       determined by the provider’s unit medical leadership, and with the consent of the MTF
       leadership when MTF facilities are used.
       10.10.2.2. Mental Health Professionals: ACU mental health providers may include:
       Clinical Psychologists, Operational Psychologists, and Licensed Clinical Social Workers
       (LCSWs).
           10.10.2.2.1. Clinical Psychologists: Clinical psychologists providing services in the
           ACU will receive Behavior Health Optimization Program (BHOP) training and
           function IAW the Primary Behavioral Health Care Services Practice Manual. When
           providing services within an MTF specialty clinic, clinical psychologists may provide
           full-spectrum mental health care IAW AFI44-119, AFI44-172, and other applicable
           policies.
           10.10.2.2.2. Operational Psychologists:       Although much of what Operational
           Psychologists do falls outside of medical channels, they may also provide traditional
           mental health care. In addition to functions as an operational psychologist,
           operational psychologists are privileged to practice IAW requirements for licensed
           clinical psychologists (outlined in AFI44-119). Other activities of an operational
           psychologist are not within the scope of clinical psychology and will consequently
           not require privileging or medical documentation. These activities may include
           assessment and selection, performance enhancement, SERE training/interventions,
           aircraft mishap investigation, and Military Information Support Operations (MISO).
           10.10.2.2.3. Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW): LCSWs providing services
           in the ACU will receive BHOP training and function IAW the Primary Behavioral
           Health Care Services Practice Manual. When providing services within an MTF
           specialty clinic, LCSWs may provide full-spectrum mental health care IAW AFI44-
           119, AFI44-172, and other applicable AF policies. Other functions which can be
           accomplished by the LCSW include (but are not limited to) case management and
           family program development, as well as consultations with medical personnel, legal
           authorities, military commanders, and school districts as required.
10.11. Scope of Care: ACUs provide office-based, medical and limited scope mental health
care, as well as spiritual and life skills support within designated squadrons, groups, and wings.
 38                                                         AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


   10.11.1. Medical care provided at the ACU (outside of an MTF) will be provided to active
   component members ONLY. Any care, counseling, or interaction provided by ACU
   providers to dependents will not occur at the ACU. Care of the active component member
   may in some circumstances include input by an active component member’s dependent(s),
   but dependents will not be seen at the ACU. (T-0) POTFF contract healthcare providers that
   are properly credentialed and privileged by the local MTF Commander may provide limited
   short-term care to dependents within the MTF on a space-available basis when local MTF
   providers are not reasonably available.
   10.11.2. ACU providers shall provide care consistent with privileges awarded by the local
   MTF. Minimally invasive procedures may be performed in the ACU (e.g. dry needling,
   acupuncture, immunizations, etc.). More invasive procedures will not be performed in the
   ACU. This includes (but is not limited to) suturing, local anesthetics, lesion removal or
   destruction, pap smears, closed reduction of fractures and nail removal.
   10.11.3. Immunizations: May be performed at ACUs but must be in compliance with all
   policies including local guidance regarding training, storage, quality assurance,
   documentation, and emergency procedures related to providing immunizations.
   10.11.4. Procedures: ACU providers should, to the maximum extent possible, perform
   procedures, for which they are being trained and supervised or for which they are privileged,
   as part of care provided to patients in their unit. ACU providers must hold privileges for
   procedures they perform. These privileges will be exercised within the MTF. The MTF will
   support the providers performing these procedures.
   10.11.5. Mental Health:
      10.11.5.1. Mental health-related interventions provided in the ACU, or by ACU
      providers within the MTF, will be in accordance with the AF Primary Behavioral Health
      Care Services practice manual. Mental health providers delivering BHOP services will
      be appropriately trained in that particular modality. POTFF assets must be privileged by
      the local MTF to be able to provide mental health care within the MTF Mental Health
      Clinic and will be in accordance with applicable local MTF, AF and DoD guidance.
      10.11.5.2. Any care provided will be provided to active component members only; no
      care, counseling, or interaction with dependents will occur at the ACU. Clinical and non-
      clinical interventions by privileged POTFF contractors in the MTF Mental Health Clinic
      will be provided to dependents in accordance with DoD policy and as detailed in
      SOCOM memo “Preservation of the Force and Families – Family Readiness
      Resources”, dated 19 Dec 2012.
      10.11.5.3. The following services are excluded at the ACU, but may be provided by
      properly trained and privileged POTFF mental health assets when working in an MTF
      mental health specialty clinic: forensic evaluations; command directed evaluations; sanity
      boards; Medical Evaluation Boards (MEBs); and independent treatment of patients who
      should be referred to mandated DoD/AF programs (e.g., ADAPT, Family Advocacy). (T-
      3)
10.12. Provision of Care:
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   39


  10.12.1. Guidance. All guidance applicable to the provision of care as noted in AFI44-119,
  Medical Quality Operations and AFI44-102, Medical Care Management, as well as patient
  privacy rules will be adhered to by all ACU providers, regardless of the site at which care is
  provided. All embedded providers will adhere to local Medical Staff Bylaws.
  10.12.2. Pharmacy: ACU providers will preferentially use the local MTF pharmacy when
  open or an AF-approved medication dispensing device (MDD), when available.
     10.12.2.1. Only when these sources cannot reasonably meet the needs for an individual
     prescription will a prescription be written and filled at a civilian pharmacy. These off-
     base prescriptions will not include refills. Ensure any prescriptions written to be filled
     off base are appropriately documented in AHLTA. This does not preclude the use of the
     Tricare Mail Order Pharmacy.
     10.12.2.2. MDD use: AF-approved MDDs are acceptable for use in the ACUs. MDDs
     would preferentially be able to communicate with CHCS/AHLTA if/when the MDDs
     have this capability. Medication dispensed from the MDD must be ordered in the A/P
     section of AHLTA then dispensed. Any medication dispensed from the MDD will be
     accompanied by complete documentation in AHLTA and a current patient education
     monograph for the medication being dispensed will be provided to the patient. No
     controlled substances will be dispensed from, or placed in, any of the ACU MDDs. (T-2)
     10.12.2.3. Operational use of stimulants, sedatives, and nutritional supplements are to be
     IAW MAJCOM supplements to Air Force Instruction (ACC for CAF, AMC for MAF,
     and AFSOC/CV policy letter for Battlefield Airmen) and the Official Air Force
     Aerospace Medicine Approved Medications list document on the Kx under Flight
     Medicine. The designated MAJCOMs will coordinate supplement development/revisions
     with AF/SG3P. Guidance on Kx remains the primary program resource until MAJCOM
     supplements are approved.
  10.12.3. Ancillary services: All lab and radiology services needed, as a result of care
  provided in the ACUs, will be provided at the local MTF.
  10.12.4. Clinical Documentation:    All clinical care provided will be documented
  electronically to include AF Form 1042, AF Form 469, medical quarters reporting, and
  ASIMS requirements.
     10.12.4.1. Prescription of any medication, to include Over-the-Counter medicine (OTCs)
     and supplements, will be performed in the Assessment/Plan module in AHLTA.
     Medication reconciliation must be accomplished at every encounter. ACUs will follow
     local MTF procedures for medication reconciliation.
     10.12.4.2. Administering treatment modalities to include (but not limited to) physical
     therapy, psychotherapy, diet prescription, or care which results in a medical diagnosis,
     requires documentation in AHLTA. (T-3)
         10.12.4.2.1. Medical documentation (IAW AFI 44-172, Mental Health) is required
         when POTFF MHPs conduct any of the following:
             10.12.4.2.1.1. Screening for mental disorders.
             10.12.4.2.1.2. Assessments in which Protected Health Information (PHI) is used
             to guide interventions or referral recommendations.
40                                                          AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014


             10.12.4.2.1.3. Individualized treatment.
     10.12.4.3. Medical management activities, to include care coordination, require
     documentation in AHLTA.
     10.12.4.4. Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS) and Defense
     Medical Information System (DMIS):
         10.12.4.4.1. A new DMIS will be created for each base on which an ACU is located.
         This single DMIS will be used for all ACUs on a given base. At locations where the
         AF is not the lead for the base, the ACU should work with the local MTF to have a
         new DMIS generated. As it may take 2 or more months to have a new DMIS
         generated, each location should use the DMIS for the host MTF until the new DMIS
         is generated.
         10.12.4.4.2. ACU MEPRS codes for care will be:
             10.12.4.4.2.1. BJAA for primary care (any care performed by a physician or a
             physician assistant)
             10.12.4.4.2.2. BJAA for mental health care. (This code is used as all mental
             health care in the ACU will be performed using the BHOP (see below) model.
             BHOP care is coded the same as primary care for the clinic in which the care is
             performed.)
             10.12.4.4.2.3. BLAA for physical therapy care.
  10.12.5. Infection Control: Infection Control activities will meet or exceed the Centers for
  Disease Control (CDC) guidance in Guide to Infection Prevention for Outpatient Settings:
  Minimum Expectations for Safe Care, available on the CDC website: search “Minimum
  Expectations for Safe Care” on the CDC website.
  10.12.6. Emergencies:
     10.12.6.1. ACU privileged providers will be trained to the Basic Life Support (BLS)
     level. ACU facilities will provide BLS (or higher level care when available) for patient
     emergencies, while seeking patient transport as needed through the 9-1-1 system. All
     buildings in which an ACU is located will have an Automated External Defibrillator
     (AED) present. This AED will be part of the base Public Access Defibrillation (PAD)
     Program. This level of response may be different than the level of response typically at
     the local MTF.
     10.12.6.2. Suicidal/Homicidal Patients. As per the AF Primary Behavioral Health Care
     Services practice manual, POTFF providers can manage patients within the ACU who are
     determined to be at low risk for suicide. Patients at a higher risk level will be referred to
     Mental Health Clinics and managed IAW high interest procedures.
     10.12.6.3. Management of Patients in Crisis (during duty and after-duty hours). Per AFI
     44-172, if emergency evaluations cannot be delivered by close of business, arrangements
     should be made for the patient to be seen at an emergency medical facility. In an
     outpatient setting, MH assessments should be performed during regular duty hours, when
     both security and privileged medical support is available. The MTF emergency
     department is the safest and most appropriate venue for conducting after-hours
AFI48-149 12 NOVEMBER 2014                                                         41


     emergency mental health assessments, including suicide risk assessments. In MTFs
     without an Emergency Department, these emergencies should be handled in a similar
     fashion to other acute medical emergencies, using community medical resources.
