1. Executive Summary:
   1.1. General. This document provides the strategic plan for the implementation and
   sustainment of ORM throughout the 944 FW. The ORM initiative includes training, tools
   and information, application to mission activity, integration and oversight. These initiatives
   will be refined, enhanced and updated as ORM integration matures, experience is gained and
   mission needs change the sustainment focus.

      1.2. Resources. All resources required to implement and sustain ORM for units within the
      944 FW will be provided by the unit.
      1.3. Financial Requirements. Current operation and maintenance funding is expected to be
      sufficient to support implementation and integration of ORM into 944 FW activities. The
      only significant future expense is funding to train replacement ORM advisors in the event of
      reassignments.
      1.4. Manpower Requirements:
         1.4.1. The wing commander has designated the Safety Office (944 FW/SE) as the 944
         FW ORM Monitor.
         1.4.2. Group commanders will appoint group or unit ORM advisors to oversee the
         implementation and sustainment of ORM for all units within their respective group.
         1.4.3. Commanders are required to create a sustainment plan letter directing the
         implementation of ORM into all operational decision making processes for their
         group/squadron/flight.
         1.4.4. Unit commanders will appoint a unit ORM advisor to assist them with
         implementing a unit ORM program. Additionally, unit shops with 50 or more personnel
         will appoint a shop ORM advisor to work with the unit ORM advisor.
         1.4.5. Commanders will ensure that appointed ORM advisors attend the ORM
         Application and Integration Course as soon as possible after appointment. The ORM
         Application and Integration Course will be unit funded.
         1.4.6. Supervisors will ensure their personnel employ ORM to all mission-related
         activities.
2. Introduction:
      2.1. Vision. Ensure an organization in which all personnel manage risk so that operations
      are successfully completed in the most mission effective manner possible. Further, to ensure
      all wing personnel are trained and use ORM in their daily duties and personal life.
      2.2. Mission. Enhance mission effectiveness while minimizing risk.
      2.3. Goals. The hierarchy of goals, illustrated in Figure 1, is the crucial framework for
      defining operational risk management.

            personnel as a part of commander’s calls. These briefings may be presented as
            Air Force or higher headquarters video presentations or as briefings by the
            group/unit ORM advisor, wing or squadron safety representatives.
            3.2.2.1.3. Personnel at every level will work with their supervisors and the
            group/unit ORM advisor to learn wing and unit procedures for applying ORM to
            mission-related activities.
            3.2.2.1.4. Project managers and team members, with the assistance of the
            group/unit ORM advisor, will employ the wing process for managing risk
            associated with mission-related activities for all projects.
            3.2.2.1.5. ORM material can be downloaded from the ORM tab on the AFRC
            Safety website (https://wwwmil.se.afrc.af.mil)

           3.2.2.2. The advisor level training includes participation in all basic level activities
           and attendance of the Air Force ORM Applications and Integration Course. Wing,
           group and unit ORM advisors are required to maintain an ORM continuity book.
           (See Attachment 2 for required items).
    3.3. Objective 2. Provide tools and information to enable ORM use.
       3.3.1. Introduction. Providing the tools and information necessary for all personnel to
       apply ORM to mission activities is essential to successful implementation of ORM
       throughout the wing. The tools and information required will be provided through Web-
       based products and personal contact.
           3.3.1.1. Information in support of ORM is available on the AFRC Safety site.
           3.3.1.2. Despite the best of training and web-based products, personal contact
           remains a staple of doing business. All personnel are encouraged to discuss any
           ORM related topic with the group/unit ORM advisor or safety representatives.
       3.3.2. Implementation and Responsibilities:
           3.3.2.1. 944 FW/SE will provide ORM products . Group/unit ORM advisors will
           also develop procedures for providing ORM material to units within their respective
           groups.
           3.3.2.2. Contact information (name, duty phone, location, etc.) of the appointed
           ORM advisors will be provided on unit additional duty rosters. The wing/group/unit
           ORM advisors will make themselves available to discuss, assist, train, and guide
           personnel with their ORM activities.
               3.3.2.2.1. Unit ORM advisors will perform periodic ORM review of all shop
               areas. Ensure ORM training is being documented and shops are integrating ORM
               into all mission activities.
               3.3.2.2.2. Group ORM advisors will submit quarterly reports to their
               commanders and wing ORM advisor outlining the number of personnel trained in
               each phase of ORM.
    3.4. Objective 3. Integrate ORM wing-wide into all mission-related activities.
       3.4.1. Introduction. Employing ORM in the conduct of mission-related activities is the
       key focus of ORM policy and guidance.

           3.4.2.1. During planning, project managers and team members will routinely
           integrate ORM into their planning activities by using the wing process for integration.
           Identified hazards and controls will be identified and integrated into the plan so they
           become a part of the planned activity. In addition, the risk analysis will be reviewed
           by unit and or group commanders before being briefed to the appropriate commander
           as a part of the planned briefing. Review of the risk analysis will be included in such
           briefings. Risks that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level will be identified to
           commanders to enable an informed decision regarding the level of risk.
               3.4.2.1.1. All shops deploying on large force temporary duty will submit to the
944FWI90-901 23 MARCH 2010                                                                    5
