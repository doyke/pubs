1. Purpose. This publication sets forth policy and procedures to be followed by JBER units
requesting JBER Public Affairs (PA) communication activities.

 2                                                                 673ABWI35-101 18 July 2012


require a Communication Tasking Order (JBER 833). Support of Priority III requests will be
determined based on PA manning and operations tempo.
     2.1. Priority I, Emergency Response and Crisis Communication. Incidents requiring
     immediate response. A crisis is a rapidly developing situation ranging from natural disasters
     to hostile activities posing a threat to US interests. A crisis becomes relevant when it is of a
     nature that commitment of US military forces and resources is contemplated to respond to the
     situation, or where the situation directly affects military assets. PA must be ready to
     implement courses of action to provide target audiences with accurate, timely and essential
     information. PA professionals are required to have the skills to engage the media and to keep
     a wide range of public venues informed during crises. The interpretation of an emergency is
     the occurrence of an event or disaster involving serious injury or fatality or an incident
     resulting in a legal claim against the US Government. Examples include, but are not limited
     to: contingency operations; humanitarian missions, aircraft accident; automobile accident
     involving serious injury or fatality of DoD personnel; accident involving DoD real estate,
     property, or equipment; legal documentation to be used as legal exhibits; homicide, spouse
     abuse, suicide, child abuse, and so forth.
     2.2. Priority II, Wartime and Operational Readiness. Mission essential or urgent
     conditions requiring one or two days response time. Examples include, but are not limited
     to: flying/ground operations, intelligence, force protection, humanitarian operations, unit
     readiness, immediate releases to news media, and serious incidents involving injury or
     impairment of operational capability.
     2.3. Priority III, PA Functions. Examples include, but are not limited to: base events;
     training; recruiting; historical documentation; command or mission videos (Wing/Brigade or
     higher); change of command/retirement ceremonies (Wing/Brigade, Group, Headquarters
     level); documentation of distinguished visitors; and documentation of significant mission
     events; award and morale programs. Normal turnaround for video or photos is three to 10
     days depending on the extent of the product. If further edits are needed after product is
     reviewed, an additional three to 10 days for product delivery will be required.
