  This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-403,
  Deployment Planning and Execution, 13 January 2008. This supplement provides the basic
  AFSPC command unique guidance to support contingency operations at all levels of command.
  It applies to all AFSPC active duty units, Numbered Air Force (NAF) and assigned wings.
  (Note: AFSPC-gained Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members will follow
  AFRC guidance unless otherwise annotated as applicable within this supplement. (NOTE:
  AFSPC-gained Air National Guard (ANG) units and members will follow guidance as outlined
  in ANG published supplemental guidance to AFI 10-403.) Refer recommended changes and
  questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT

1.6.1.12.2. (Added) UDMs will not be assigned additional duties which will remove them from
their primary responsibility as UDMs.

year. Out of cycle updates are required only when authorization changes to UTC Availability
“DW_” coded UTCs exceed ten percent of the wing’s current number of “DW_” coded UTCs.
AFRC requirements will be computed by AFRC Plans office and reported through AFRC
channels, with info copies to host Logistics Readiness Squadron as outlined by AFI 10-403, para
2.26.1.
2.26.1.3. (Added) Wings will coordinate with HQ AFSPC/A4RMS, Supply Management,

Out of cycle updates are required only when authorization changes to UTC Availability “DW_”
coded UTCs exceed ten percent of the wing’s current number of “DW_” coded UTCs. The

using AFCAT 21-209, Ground Munitions, Volume 1. Individual unit or central base munitions

Readiness Squadron as outlined by AFI 10-403, para 2.26.1.
2.27.1.2. (Added) Wings will coordinate with HQ AFSPC/A4RME, Supply Management,
