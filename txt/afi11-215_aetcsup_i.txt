                                             Chapter 2

                  FLIGHT MANUAL PROGRAM (FMP) PUBLICATIONS

2.1. General. The following manuals are governed by this instruction: Basic Flight Manuals (-1
series), Air Refueling Procedures (1-1C-1 series), Basic Weight Checklist and Loading Data (-5
series), Functional Check Flight (-6CF series), Cargo Aircraft Loading Manuals (-9 series),
Cargo Aircraft Nuclear Weapon Loading (-16 series), Nuclear Weapon Delivery (-25 through -
31 series), Non-nuclear Munitions Delivery (-34 series) and Mission Operation (-43 series).
2.1. (AETC)Only USAF flight manual publications will be used to operate AETC
aircraft. AETC aircrew and international students will adhere to policies and procedures as
defined in this publication, TOs 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System, and 00-5-3, Technical
Manual Acquisition Procedures. Policies and procedures defined in TO 00-5-19, Security
Assistance Technical Order Program, do not apply to operations in USAF aircraft at AETC
Formal Training Unit (FTU) locations. Country Standard Technical Orders (CSTOs) developed
as part of the (USAF) Security Assistance Technical Order Program (SATOP) will not be used to
operate AETC aircraft, nor are they required as part of ground or flight training conducted at
AETC units. Disclosure of USAF flight manuals to international students (if granted by Foreign
Disclosure Office) is only permitted in controlled areas. A controlled area is defined as any area
or space for which the unit has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided
are sufficient and that uncontrolled movement will not result in the compromise of STINFO.
Flight Manuals will not be copied for or by the students and will not be allowed to leave the
controlled area.
NOTE: TO 00-5-19 procedures apply if operating non-US aircraft procured as part of the
Security Assistance Program (SAP), regardless of training location.
     2.1.1. NATO Allied Tactical Publication, ATP-56(B), Air-To-Air Refueling, has become the
     primary source to provide aircrew with internationally standardized definitions, abbreviations
     and procedures to enable successful and safe Air-to-Air Refueling AAR operations. For
     aircraft with an in-flight refueling capability, the relevant TO-1 series provides supplemental
     MDS specific information on AAR orbit and rendezvous and procedures concerning
     tanker/receiver       formations.            ATP        56(B)     can       be     found     at
     http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/airtoair56b.cfm.
     2.1.2. ATP-56(B) offers information pertinent to refueling with boom, probe and drogue
     equipped HC/MC-130, KC-135, KC-10 and KC-45 aircraft. The appropriate tanker National
     Annex provides information crucial to successful AAR from allied tankers.
2.2. Responsibilities.
     2.2.1. PMs/SPDs of military aircraft acquisition programs will:
        2.2.1.1. Establish a FMP when setting up a TO Management Agency (see TO 00-5-1).
        This responsibility extends for the life of the system and includes complete flight manual
        coordination responsibility across the AF system.
        2.2.1.2. Appoint a qualified (see paragraph 5.1.1). FMM to manage the FMP for the life
        of the aircraft program. This includes initial acquisition and verification, maintenance and
        periodic reviews.
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                             9


      2.2.1.3. Establish procedures to ensure FMP records are maintained for the life of the
      program. Records include: applicable source data, certification documents, verification
      records, waiver documents, change requests, FMRC minutes and Deficiency Reports that
      affect the flight manuals. When two qualified FMMs are assigned, one at the Product
      Center (PC) during acquisition and one at the Air Logistics Center (ALC) for life cycle
      management under the Capabilities-Based delivery and sustainment concept, establish
      procedures to ensure FMP direction is coordinated and FMP records are maintained.
      2.2.1.4. Ensure flight manuals for which the PM is responsible are addressed in the
      MDS/weapon system-specific Comprehensive Air Force Technical Order Plan
      (CAFTOP) annex. Use CAFTOP data to report flight manual currency metric on a
      quarterly basis.
      2.2.1.5. Ensure flight test programs contain adequate instructions to gather data for flight
      manuals. See MIL-DTL-7700G, Detail Specification, Flight Manuals, Air Refueling
      Procedures, and Abbreviated Checklists for requirements.
      2.2.1.6. Ensure all program elements (engineering, logistics, funding, etc.) support the
      FMP and its schedule (Attachment 4)
      2.2.1.7. Ensure that all technical order management and support activities adhere strictly
      to the 00-5 series technical orders and the AF Technical Order System. Ensure that all
      FMP acquisitions are verified and certified in accordance with TO 00-5-3 and AFI 63-
      104, The SEEK EAGLE Program, for acquisitions involving aircraft-store compatibility.
2.3. FMP Publications.
   2.3.1. The minimum print quality for all FMP publications is Level III (Good Quality), as
   described in GPO Publication 310.1, Quality Assurance Through Attributes Program For
   Printing and Binding. These products require above average materials, printing,
   workmanship, quality control and commensurate production time. Products of this level
   require clean, sharp printing of single or multi-color work (general process color work) and
   halftone reproductions up to 150-line screen. Above average quality of the original copy,
   films, composition, reproduction proofs and typography standards are required to ensure the
   accuracy, durability and appearance of the finished printed product.
   2.3.2. Only the FMM (ALC or PC assigned) may change, add, delete, and rearrange
   procedures or information in assigned FMP publications, preliminary FMP publications,
   operational and safety supplements, TO/Preliminary TO change(s) and revisions as specified
   in TOs 00-5-1 and 00-5-3. This authority cannot be delegated to the MAJCOM level or the
   MDS engineer. The MDS FMM and MDS primary engineer will ensure an established
   process is in place which verifies accuracy of FMP publication engineering content to
   support weapon system/lead MAJCOM requirements. This process will include a quality
   review of FM content by the lead MAJCOM or its delegate. The MDS FMM must approve
   all MDS FM changes. Flight Crew Information Files (FCIF) are not an authorized means of
   directing changes to flight manual guidance.
      2.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) When a performance conflict is observed (between data
      produced by computer software program and manually extracted), the FM remains the
      source authority.
10                                              AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011


  2.3.3. A change or revision is the preferred method for updating flight manual publications.
  However, if a formal supplement is the most expeditious and logical way to provide critical
  information to the field, FMMs may issue the formal supplement(s) with the concurrence of
  the lead and using commands. Hold supplemental write-in changes to an absolute minimum.
  Incorporate, supersede or rescind supplements as soon as practical, but not later than one year
  from date of issue. If the lead MAJCOM and FMM deem that a supplement should remain
  past the one-year time limit, notify HQ AFMC/A3V and USAF/A4MM 30 days prior to
  expiration.
  2.3.4. Only use a supplement to update the basic publication. Do not use supplements to
  update information or procedures in a previous supplement.
  2.3.5. Formal supplements affecting procedural checklists will contain temporary checklist
  pages.
  2.3.6. Interim supplements affecting flight crew checklists will authorize write-in changes to
  the affected checklist. If practical, temporary checklists pages (cut out) may be provided as
  an attachment to the interim supplement.
  2.3.7. The FMM will coordinate with lead MAJCOM before deciding whether to formalize
  an interim supplement. Replace interim supplements affecting flight crew checklists with
  formal supplements containing temporary checklist pages. Publish a formal supplement or
  change and complete initial distribution (ID) within 40 calendar days after dispatch of the
  interim supplement. That decision may depend on whether a formal change is near the
  publishing stage of development.
  2.3.8. For supplements affecting scroll checklists, maintenance or aircrew will make write-in
  changes on scroll checklists prior to use as directed by the supplement.
  2.3.9. All FMP interim or formal supplements will include a status page or a paragraph
  listing all current supplements outstanding against affected manual and checklist.
  2.3.10. If crews use the flight manual as their primary procedural source (instead of
  abbreviated checklist) while the aircraft is in flight, the Emergency Procedures (EP) section
  will only be updated using a formal change, unless the interim or formal supplement provides
  replacement pages (i.e., no write-in changes for the EP section under these circumstances).
  Temporary replacement pages are permissible. The time to publish the change will be the
  same as a formal supplement.
  2.3.11. Unless authorized by the MAJCOM with approval from the FMM or in MDS-
  specific AFI, do not integrate/combine checklists derived from different flight manuals to
  form single checklists.
  2.3.11. (AETC) Unit requests to integrate and/or combine checklists are coordinated
  through 19 AF/DO to HQ AETC/A3FV for approval.
     2.3.11.1. Unit developed checklists (e.g., fanfold, local checklists, etc.), to include
     performance data inserts, will not be used in lieu of flight crew checklists unless
     authorized in the AFI 11-2 MDS-specific volumes and approved by MAJCOM Stan/Eval
     and MDS FMM. When approved, as a minimum, these checklists will contain all items
     (verbatim and in order, unless specifically addressed in the basic flight manual) listed in
     the applicable checklists. These checklists will reflect the same change number, change
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                            11


       date and applicable supplement numbers as the flight crew checklist for configuration
       control.
       2.3.11.2. MAJCOMs may authorize crewmembers not to carry specific sections of
       aircraft, weapons or refueling manuals and flight crew checklists that do not apply to unit
       MDS weapons systems or equipment. Crewmembers will maintain these sections as
       directed by MAJCOM Stan/Eval.
       2.3.11.2. (AETC) OG/CCs may withhold sections/checklists that do not apply to unit
       MDS weapon systems or equipment. Withheld sections/checklists will be annotated on
       the List of Effective Pages (LEP).
       2.3.11.3. MAJCOMs may add more restrictive items to flight crew checklists to enhance
       training, tactical operations or for special operations with the concurrence of the FMM.
       Send copies of these items to the FMM and review at the next Flight Manual Review
       Conference (FMRC) for inclusion in FM.
   2.3.12. MAJCOMs may authorize units to withhold supplements that do not apply to the
   aircraft they operate. If MAJCOMs use this authorization it will be identified in MAJCOM
   supplement to this instruction.
   2.3.12. (AETC) OG/CCs may withhold supplements that do not apply to unit MDS weapon
   systems or equipment. Withheld supplements will be annotated on the LEP.
   2.3.13. (Added-AETC) Locally prepared publications/checklists/In Flight Guides (IFG)
   must also include a title page with the number, title and date of the TO/pub/checklists
   affected, the issue date of the local document, and LEP, locally generated pages and posting
   instructions.
2.4. Scroll Checklists. FMMs may develop and issue paper scroll checklists using official TO
revisions or supplements to help complement the basic and functional check flight manuals.
2.5. Supplemental Flight Manuals:
   2.5.1. FMMs will develop classified flight manuals and checklists according to MIL-DTL-
   7700G.
   2.5.2. FMMs will develop supplemental flight manuals and checklists for aircraft
   modifications intended to be permanent according to MIL-DTL-7700G. These manuals and
   checklists complement the basic flight manual and are incomplete without it. The source data
   and preliminary technical data (PTO) for these manuals will be verified in accordance with
   TO 00-5-3 and where appropriate will be certified in accordance with AFI 63-104 for
   acquisitions involving aircraft-store compatibility.
   2.5.3. As part of the formal flight test plan, MAJCOMs may develop interim modification
   flight manuals (MFMs) and checklists outside the formal TO development system.
       2.5.3.1. These manuals and checklists provide operating instructions and information for
       a small number of aircraft modified for engineering and flight testing.
       2.5.3.2. Only information and procedures resulting from the modification need to be
       included in the MFM since a standard flight manual is required for the aircraft. Data from
       the standard flight manual will be included in the MFM only to the extent required for
       clarity and understanding.

       2.5.3.3. MAJCOMs that conduct formal flight testing will establish procedures for
       developing these manuals.
       2.5.3.4. The information, data, and procedures in these manuals and checklists will be
       verified by the flight test crews in accordance with TO 00-5-3.
2.6. Commercial Aircraft Flight Manuals. Commercial aircraft (which have been certified by
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)) and are procured (to included leased or bailed
aircraft) by the USAF may utilize manufacturer provided flight manuals, including checklists,
provided the provisions of Department of Defense (DOD) MIL-PRF-32216, Evaluation of
Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Manuals and Preparation of Supplemental Data, have been
met. The provisions of this instruction apply to COTS operated aircraft.
2.7. Joint Flight Manuals.
   2.7.1. AFJI 21-301, Inter-servicing of Technical Manuals and Related Technology,
   prescribes the polices, agreements, and procedures for exchanging Technical Manuals and
   associated information on common-use equipment by military services and the Defense
   Logistics Agencies, (components). In development of new weapons systems, the PM will
   coordinate with the Lead MAJCOM/CC to determine if the provisions of a Joint Flight
   Manual meet the mission requirements for his aircrew (see paragraph 6.4.1.12 for lead
   MAJCOM responsibilities for Joint Flight Manual coordination).

   establish procedures to ensure the FMM is notified of all TO updates that could affect FMP
   publications. Procedures will also ensure notification of the responsible maintenance agency
   within the PM/SPD for inclusion into maintenance manuals, if applicable. The office with
   administration management responsibility for FMP publications will:
      5.1.6.1. Establish printing priorities for FMP publications by coordination with the FMM
      and the base information management directorate. Give special attention to priorities and
      time limits for safety and operational supplements.
      5.1.6.2. Track the production of all FMP publications through the entire publication
      cycle.
      5.1.6.3. Establish procedures so crewmembers do not operate new or modified
      equipment or aircraft, without proper companion technical data according to AFPD 21-3,
      Technical Orders, AFI 21-303, Technical Orders, and TO 00-5-series TOs. Technical
      data must be at least to the level of verified Preliminary Tech Orders and will be in a
      format usable by aircrews. Red-line or mark-up data will not be used. Ensure draft
      technical data is available a minimum of 30 days prior to delivery of new or modified
      equipment/aircraft.

      5.1.6.4. Establish and support an online electronic format that meets STINFO
      requirements (e.g., CoP) in order to provide FMMs an ability to effectively communicate
      and manage FM changes in coordination with the MAJCOMs representatives.
      5.1.6.5. Coordinate with designated Lead MAJCOMs on any flight manual change
      affecting both operations and logistics.
5.2. FMM Responsibilities:
   5.2.1. Manage the technical content, format and accuracy of assigned FMP publications as
   defined below and specified in AFPD 21-3, AFI, 21-302, Technical Data Requirements For
   Logistic Support, AFI 21-303, AFI 20-101, Logistics Strategic Planning Procedures, AFI 63-
   101, Operations of Capabilities Based Acquisition System, TOâ€™s 00-5-Series Technical
   Orders, MIL-DTL-7700G and successive standards that may apply. This includes initial
   acquisition and verification, sustainment and periodic reviews.
   5.2.1. (AETC) With concurrence of 664 AESS/D, HQ AETC/A3FV assumes responsibility
   of T-6A FM manager.
   5.2.2. Coordinate with the TO manager for FMP contracting, funding, numbering, printing,
   distribution and indexing.
   5.2.3. Ensure overall compliance with policies and procedures established by HQ
   USAF/A4M; HQ AFMC/A4; HQ AFMC/A3; the Director, Nuclear Weapons Product
   Support Center, AF Air Armament Center (AAC/WNE, Eglin AFB FL, 32542); AF Air
   Armament Center (AAC/XR, Eglin AFB FL, 32542) (for non-nuclear weapons); and the Life
   Support System Program Director (77 AESG/TAL 311 HSW/YA, Brooks AFB TX, 78235).
   5.2.4. Participate in the TO Planning and Requirements Conference, Guidance Conference,
   In Process Reviews (IPRs), preliminary and critical design reviews, pre- and post-publication
   reviews, Flight TO Review Boards (FTORBs) and other acquisition functions to develop and
   maintain quality control in assigned FMP and technical competence on their military system.
   5.2.5. Determine requirements for new and updated FMP publications through coordination
   with using commands. Provide using commands a FM copy (online posting considered
   appropriate) that allows track changes electronically for a pre-publication review and
   comment NLT 7 days after editing process is complete (Production Phase) and prior to print
   package preparation. Maintain a permanent record of proposed MAJCOM changes and
   disposition of recommended changes.
   5.2.6. Comply with schedules in Attachment 4. Support aircraft test and delivery schedules.
   5.2.7. Send requests for deviation or waiver of FMP TO specification requirements to lead
   command for coordination and AFMC/A4YE for approval (information copy to AFMC/A3V
   and HQ USAF/A4MM).
   5.2.8. Maintain permanent records of all approved waivers and deviations to FMP TO
   specifications for the life cycle of the MDS.
   5.2.9. When lead command approves the use of commercial manuals, maintain a permanent
   copy of the approval letter or document for the life cycle of the MDS (see paragraph 2.6).

  5.2.10. Monitor FMP publications and other program TOâ€™s affecting the FMP for
  compatibility. Advise the USAF FMPM of all potential conflicts in FMP policy or
  specification.
  5.2.11. Postpone minor correction/updates to FMP not affecting operations or safety until a
  major change or revision.
  5.2.12. Submit FMP publications and updates for publishing and distribution (see
  Attachment 4). Notify using commands and the USAF FMPM of delays citing the reason
  for delay and include new schedule dates.
  5.2.13. Issue an updated supplement concurrently with a change or revision when the change
  or revision contains part of that existing supplement. This will ensure that the revised
  supplement matches the revised data that was changed by the change or revision. Issuance of
  an updated supplement is not required for obsolete instructions that are not incorporated in
  the change or revision. For example, completion of a TCTO by the time the change is
  published may void the need for certain instructions in a supplement, while remaining
  instructions may be permanent guidance.
  5.2.14. Ensure concurrent distribution of changes and revisions affecting flight manuals,
  associated checklists and any associated manuals.
  5.2.15. Process safety and operational supplements as follows:
     5.2.15.1. Issue an interim safety or operational supplement (if required) within 48 hours
     after receiving lead/using command and ALC/PC engineering (if required) validation and
     approval. The 48 hour clock begins when the MAJCOM approves the supplement. If no
     reply is received by using commands within 48 hours, then lead command and the FMM
     will consider the supplement approved.
     5.2.15.1. (AETC) HQ AETC/A3FV and the appropriate 19 AF/DO branch chief must
     approve all AETC-lead command interim safety and operational supplements before the
     FM manager (FMM) transmits them. HQ AETC/A3FV forwards proposed MDS
     supplements to 19 AF/DO that are received from other major commands (MAJCOM) for
     which AETC is not the lead. If no response within 48 hours is received, HQ AETC/A3FV
     assumes concurrence and sends AETC position to the lead MAJCOM.
     5.2.15.2. Ensure initial distribution (ID) of formal safety or operational supplements not
     preceded by interim supplements within 48 hours for an emergency supplement and
     within 40 days for an urgent supplement. NOTE: Initial Distribution is "complete" on the
     date material is placed in Enhanced Technical Information Management System
     (ETIMS), (formerly Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition Logistics Support), the mail, or
     transmitted, whichever occurs first.
     5.2.15.3. Request issuance of formal supplements, changes or revisions to replace
     interim supplements affecting checklists after validating the contents of the interim
     supplement.
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                              19


   5.2.16. Every effort will be made to ensure FMP publication changes or supplements
   associated with Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) are distributed before the
   TCTO publication, not later than 30 days prior to delivery or modification of the first aircraft
   affected. The FMM will coordinate with the TO manager to ensure concurrent delivery of
   manuals and associated checklists, supplements and TCTOs. The following options must be
   considered:
      5.2.16.1. Obtain guarantee of concurrent delivery from the print contractor through
      Defense Auto Printing Service (DAPS). If DAPS cannot guarantee, obtain guarantee and
      printing support from off-base printing facilities.
      5.2.16.2. Use Document Automation & Production Service (DAPS) on-demand printing
      services when available and the quality of print specifications can be met.
      5.2.16.3. If neither is feasible, request a direct-deal printing contract with a vendor.
   5.2.17. Establish a Quality Assurance (QA) program to inspect and approve reproduction
   media and printed or electronic copies of publications before distribution (e.g., inspection of
   the first article of a publication print run). NOTE: The QA program usually operates through
   Memoranda of Agreement or Understanding between the FMMs organization and the
   inspecting agency.
   5.2.18. Determine the need for, schedule and chair a FMRC for each assigned publication.
   5.2.19. Ensure funding is available for administrative requirements (reproducible copies of
   FMP publications) before convening an FMRC.
   5.2.20. Coordinate all aerial refueling changes affecting flight manuals for HC/MC-130, KC
   -135, KC-10, and KC-45 through the normal AF Form 847 change process to FMMs.
   5.2.21. Coordinate changes that affect international standard definitions, abbreviations and
   procedures for refueling IAW ATP56 change procedures. Also coordinate AF wide aerial
   refueling configuration changes that affect international refueling procedures IAW ATP-
   56(B) change process. It is essential that FMMs provide comments, corrections, and queries
   regarding ATP-56(B) in order to keep the international standard up-to-date. Submit changes
   on an AF Form 847 through channels established by major commands, to HQ AMC/A3VK
   at ATP-56@scott.af.mil.
   5.2.22. Coordinate all MDS-specific non-nuclear weapons manual (-34 series) changes that
   impact specific weapons with the FMM for the parent TO 1-1M-34 (AAC/AQY). To ensure
   standardization of all weapons issues, accomplish coordination prior to finalizing any
   changes.
5.3. Flight Manual Review Conference (FMRC):
   5.3.1. The FMM for a weapons system will act as the chairperson for the FMRC for that
   weapon system and will conduct an FMRC at least annually unless using commands agree to
   delay. The FMM will notify the USAF FMPM and MFMPM of all scheduled FMRC dates
   and any proposed rescheduled dates.

   5.3.2. FMRC Agenda:
        5.3.2.1. Develop an agenda to include a review of all recommended changes (AF Forms
        847 or electronic change process request), service bulletins, Operations Manual Bulletins,
        FAA Airworthiness Directives, and Temporary Revisions and like data (ref. TO 00-5-
        Series) that apply to the FMRC directed weapon system.
        5.3.2.2. Notify FMRC participants, including AFMC/A3V and using commands of the
        proposed FMRC date 90 days prior to the scheduled FMRC.
        5.3.2.3. Make copies of all proposed agenda items, including AF Form 847s available
        electronically no later than 30 days prior to the scheduled FMRC start date using the CoP
        or AF approved secure web page. Notify additional (supporting) FMRC participants, as
        necessary, to include aircraft manufacturer, engineering support, publishing contractor,
        and Air Force Safety Center.
        5.3.2.4. Agenda items from the field are due to the FMM no later than 45 days prior to
        the scheduled FMRC. Routine items received after this time will be addressed at the end
        of the FMRC as â€• additional items.â€– Additional items may or may not be included in the
        subsequent change depending on completion of engineering analysis or other required
        actions.
        5.3.2.4. (AETC) Forty-five days are required for HQ staff coordination and using
        command review. Routine AF Forms 847 received by HQ AETC/A3FV later than 45
        days prior to an FMRC will not be considered as part of an FMRC agenda.

                              MAJCOM RESPONSIBILITIES

6.1. General Responsibilities. Using commands (including FOAs/DRUs) will ensure personnel
comply with this instruction, AFPD 21-3, AFI 21-302 and 21-303, and TO 00-5-Series
publications.
6.2. MAJCOM Flight Manual Program Manager (MFMPM): Each command A3 and
FOA/DRU (as required) will assign a primary and alternate Flight Manual Program Manager for
the command. Forward the names of these individuals to AFMC/A3V for inclusion on the
USAF Flight Manuals CoP whenever personnel change. The MFMPM will:
   6.2.1. Be the single point for flight manual issues for that command. For each weapon
   system in which the MAJCOM is lead, that individual (and alternate) will also serve as
   primary and alternate voting member of the FMESG (reference Chapter 3) and in addition
   the MAF and CAF MFMPMs will be voting members on the AF CTOM Committee.
   6.2.2. Assist in development of the MAJCOM TO digitization strategy for each weapons
   system for which the MAJCOM is responsible for, including new acquisition programs. All
   FMs are required to meet the guidelines established in the AF TO CONOPS. Provide USAF
   Flight Manual Manager with a copy of the TO digitization strategy for each weapon system
   for which the MAJCOM is lead at the beginning of each FY. Assist the SM/SPD and FMM
   in determining the scope of technical material to be included in FMs and the overall needs of
   the user. Update SM/SPD and FMM on new military specification, military standard, print
   and or paper requirements for budget inclusion in CAFTOP process.
   6.2.3. Ensure verification is complete for FMs of assigned military weapon systems and
   IAW approved verification plans. The TO Manager, in coordination with the Lead/Using
   Commands, may designate or delegate this responsibility to a separate organization.
6.3. ALL MAJCOMs:
   6.3.1. Publish a listing containing the MAJCOM FM POC for each MDS that the command
   operates (PACAF and USAFE responsibilities for this will reside with the MDS lead
   Command). Forward this listing to HQ AFMC/A3V for inclusion on the USAF Flight
   Manuals CoP, include the name, e-mail and DSN. Additionally, each MAJCOM (and
   subordinate level) will establish a Workflow email account address for receiving FMP
   information.
   6.3.1. (AETC) Each unit stan/eval office will submit a POC for each MDS, by crew
   position, under its supervision to HQ AETC/A3FV no later than 15 December annually, and
   as changes occur. Include all pertinent defense switched network (DSN) telephone numbers
   for voice and facsimile, as well as e-mail addresses so that important information on
   operations, standardization, and safety can be quickly disseminated to aircrews. Each OG/CC
   (or equivalent) will establish an organizational email account capable of sending and
   receiving encrypted email. This account will be the primary method used by AETC to
   transmit time critical flight safety information, such as Flight Crew Information Files (FCIF),
   AF Form 847s, flight manual interim safety or operational supplements (ISS/IOS), and field
   guidance memorandums (FGM).

  6.3.2. Establish procedures for processing and coordinating all recommended changes (AF
  Form 847 or electronic change process) according to Attachment 2 and the following
  instructions:
     6.3.2.1. Ensure procedures prevent forwarding of duplicate of recommended changes.
     Use only one AF Form 847 (or electronic change process request) when the identical
     change proposal effects both the basic flight manual and its abbreviated checklist.
     6.3.2.2. Establish an electronic means to inform lead and using commands of the
     coordination requirements and disposition of recommended TO changes (CoP or AF
     approved secure web site). Ensure the originator is informed of the disposition of each
     recommended change at each level of the approval process; this may be accomplished
     using an online data base accessible by the originator.
     6.3.2.3. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate with respective MDS Lead Commands an
     appropriate process to ensure recommended change coordination and responsibilities are
     met.
  6.3.3. Ensure FMP publications are maintained in the highest state of currency and accuracy
  including the evaluation of assigned publications according to AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew
  Standardization/Evaluation Program.
     6.3.3.1. (Added-AETC) OG and squadron FCIF libraries (FM publication portion only)
     are subject to guidance specified in TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System, because they
     are classified as Operational Libraries types (TO 00-5-1). Annually, units will inventory
     FCIF libraries to ensure the contents are complete and current (current basic and all
     increments posted). Compare the contents to either a current â€•   Master TO Report by
     Accountâ€– listing provided by the servicing TODO/TODA, or against the TO Catalog.
     Ensure each paragraph of the basic FMP publication affected by supplements is annotated
     to show the supplement number.
     6.3.3.2. (Added-AETC) To ensure currency of individual flight crewmembersâ€™ FMP
     publications, each unit will:
         6.3.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) Maintain a list of publications required for each aircrew
         positions.
         6.3.3.2.2. (Added-AETC) Periodically review publication requirements to ensure
         there are adequate supplies.
         6.3.3.2.3. (Added-AETC) Conduct an initial review; thereafter, conduct a periodic
         review (frequency determined by OG/CC) to ensure individuals post changes and
         supplements. Note: For units that entered initial issue and periodic flight publications
         review into the Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS), the date of entry in
         ARMS certifies initial issue and review of required publications for currency and
         posting.

  6.3.4. Ensure FMP publications are readily available to meet all aircrew and mission
  requirements. MAJCOMs will comply with the following instructions:
     6.3.4.1. Establish procedures for the accounting and issuance of personal copies of
     needed FMP publications in electronic or paper format to flight crewmembers on active
     flying status. Any flight crew member who requests a personal copy will have it
     provided. Do not issue new FMP publications until in receipt of all associated basic and
     abbreviated checklist changes. MAJCOM Stan/Eval functions may only withhold the
     immediate release of updates, excluding interim or formal supplements, until the updates
     are available to all crewmembers on weapons system within their command. Interim and
     formal supplements will be released immediately, unless supplement or notification
     instructions state otherwise or they contain errors that would jeopardize safety or
     operational posture, in such cases the safety or operational concern must be resolved
     within 30 days. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with respective MDS Lead
     Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and responsibilities are met.
     6.3.4.1. (AETC) At the discretion of the unit commander, units may forego issuing
     FMPs to individual crewmembers (unless requested by the individual) and elect to
     maintain publications for each assigned MDS aircraft.
        6.3.4.1.1. (Added-AETC) If FMs and checklists are not issued to individual
        crewmembers, squadrons must maintain sufficient copies of applicable FMs and
        checklists for study and mission planning and, if required, issue before flight.
        6.3.4.1.2. (Added-AETC) Accounting and issuing procedures are delegated to the
        OG/CC. Note: FMP publications do not have to be â€•numberedâ€– as part of a unitâ€™s
        accounting procedures.
        6.3.4.1.3. (Added-AETC) FMP publications â€• storageâ€– that have not yet been
                                                      in
        issued to crewmembers or used as part of a reference library are not required to be
        posted or current. Once issued, crewmembers must post them before they are used.
        6.3.4.1.4. (Added-AETC) OG/CCs may withhold basic FM supplements until
        associated flight crew checklists are received. Notify 19 AF/DO and HQ
        AETC/A3FV if there is an extended delay in receipt of products.
     6.3.4.2. Establish internal distribution procedures for electronic or paper FMP
     publications, including interim safety and operational supplements, so that flight
     crewmembers have all changes and revisions affecting required flight manuals, checklists
     and any associated manuals before participating in flight operations. PACAF and USAFE
     will coordinate, with respective MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure
     procedures and responsibilities are met.
     6.3.4.2. (AETC) See paragraph 6.3.4.2.4 for AETC internal distribution procedures.
        6.3.4.2.1. As paper FMs continue to be the emergency backup for use inflight for the
        majority of the AF weapon system inventory, MAJCOMs may withhold release of
        digital media until paper is distributed (NOTE: FM printing costs are accounted for
        in the publication process (CAFTOP) and remain the responsibility of the PM/SPD
        office).

     6.3.4.2.2. Establish procedures to ensure concurrent use of scroll, electronic
     checklists and paper FMP products. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with
     respective MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and
     responsibilities are met.
     6.3.4.2.3. To ensure a redundant system is in place to view FCIF Library anytime,
     establish policy to backup any electronically viewed publications kept in the FCIF
     library.
     6.3.4.2.4. (Added-AETC) AETC internal distribution procedures include:
        6.3.4.2.4.1. (Added-AETC) Unit commanders will ensure crewmembers are
        aware of all information published in current FMP publications before
        participating in flight operations. Squadron commanders will ensure individuals
        review new changes and supplements before their next flight. This process is
        documented in Part B of the squadron flight crew information file (FCIF).
        6.3.4.2.4.2. (Added-AETC) Unit commanders will appoint, by memorandum,
        an officer or noncommissioned officer at each operations staff level (down to and
        including squadron or detachment) as the FMs control officer to carry out the
        requirements of AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures; AFI 11-215; TO 00-
        5-1, AF Technical Order System; and AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment
        Life Cycle Management. When a group consists of more than one collocated unit,
        the OG/CC may consolidate the FMs control responsibility at the group level and
        manage existing group resources from within.
        6.3.4.2.4.3. (Added-AETC) OG/CCs will publish written procedures to ensure
        FMs, checklists, changes, and safety or operational supplements are distributed in
        a timely manner. These procedures will ensure that aircrews have the latest
        publication changes that affect their aircraft or mission before operating or
        maintaining aircraft or equipment.
        6.3.4.2.4.4. (Added-AETC) AETC does not â€•        releaseâ€– FM publication revisions,
        changes, or supplements. Units are cleared to implement upon receipt. Post all
        FMs within 5 workdays from date received by the library custodian. Aircrew
        members will post all FMs prior to flight. If implementing a FM publication
        revision or change will create â€•
                                       safety of flightâ€– issues with another MAJCOM due
        to interfly requirements, OG/OGVs will contact 19 AF/DO and HQ AETC/A3FV
        for resolution. NOTE: If a unit desires to withhold revisions and changes until
        lead MAJCOM has â€•     releasedâ€–, this practice must be identified on a Memo for
        Record (MFR) signed by the OG and approved by AETC/A3FV. IOS/ISSs will be
        released upon receipt and not withheld.
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                         25


             6.3.4.2.4.5. (Added-AETC) Every effort should be made to ensure concurrent
             distribution of changes and revisions affecting USAF flight manuals, redacted
             checklists (to include fanfold) for international students, and any associated
             manuals. If implementing a USAF FM change will create â€•   safety of flightâ€– issues
             due to delay of the redacted checklists, OG/OGVs will contact 19 AF/DO and HQ
             AETC/A3FV for resolution. It is recognized that there may be delays in updates
             to the corresponding CSTOs, but this is acceptable due their â€• referenceâ€– nature
             vs. operational use.
             6.3.4.2.4.6. (Added-AETC) OG/CCs will establish procedures to determine the
             applicability of safety and operational supplements on assigned MDS aircraft. The
             applicable information from these supplements will be expeditiously extracted,
             reproduced, and distributed to all affected aircraft flight crews.
     6.3.4.3. Electronic and paper checklists should be maintained concurrently. However,
     MAJCOMs may establish procedures to allow use of one medium with the other medium
     non-current provided operators are notified and aware of the difference. MAJCOMS will
     establish which checklist will be used as primary reference.
         6.3.4.3.1. MAJCOMs are responsible for coordinating through appropriate
         maintenance channels to ensure update of the onboard integrated electronic checklists
         (when aircraft systems contain this material) to the most current version as soon as
         practical. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with respective MDS Lead
         Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and responsibilities are met.
         6.3.4.3.2. Crewmembers that use onboard integrated electronic checklists (Flight
         Management Systems, not a removable laptop system) as their primary reference in-
         flight will use the most current publication for review before and during flight.
     6.3.4.4. Establish procedures for periodic reviews to ensure currency of flight
     crewmembers' FMP publications.
  6.3.5. DELETED
  6.3.6. Provide representative(s) and identify who has the authority to act for the command at
  FMESG conferences and FMRCs for command operated aircraft.
  6.3.6. (AETC) HQ AETC/A3FV will represent AETC at FMP conferences and FMs review
  conferences (FMRC). If HQ AETC/A3FV is unable to attend an FMRC, a representative
  from HQ AETC/A3F or 19 AF/DO will be designated as the MAJCOM representative.
  6.3.7. Conduct a command analysis of applicable FMP publications, including nuclear
  weapon and non-nuclear munitions delivery manuals, for each FMRC. Send change
  recommendations to the FMM a minimum of 30 calendar days before scheduled FMRCs, or
  when the FMM requests. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with respective MDS Lead
  Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and responsibilities are met.
  NOTE: Non-MAJCOM reviewed recommended changes (i.e., walk-ins) will be considered
  at the FMRC after all agenda items are covered.
  6.3.7. (AETC) Units, using AF Forms 847, must coordinate their recommendations with 19
  AF/ADO and HQ AETC/A3FV before submitting consideration at FMRCs.
26                                             AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011


  6.3.8. Identify to the FMM any unique requirements needed for the flight manual or
  checklist, (e.g., use of synthetic paper stock IPDF, new checklist style, etc.) at least 60
  calendar days before the FMRC. If funding differs from FY submitted CAFTOP, then
  coordinate for appropriate funding. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with respective
  MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and responsibilities are
  met.
  6.3.9. Establish procedures in the command supplement to this instruction to identify
  publication problems that are not reported by an AF Form 847 (or electronic change process
  request), such as word omissions, typographical, printing or quality errors. If MAJCOMs
  conduct formal flight test include interim modification flight manuals (MFMs) and checklists
  development guidance in the MAJCOM formal supplement, include in it the review and
  approval levels of responsibility.
  6.3.9. (AETC) E-mail minor FMP publication errors through normal command channels to
  HQ AETC/A3FV. HQ AETC/A3FV forwards the errors to the appropriate FMM.
  6.3.10. Establish an internal process through MAJCOM Stan/Eval offices whereby a pre-
  publication review of flight manual changes or revisions can be accomplished for the FMM.
  The MAJCOMs will be provided 7 days between FMMâ€™s editing process and the 10â€“day
  prepublication review process to review any changes in the FM. PACAF and USAFE will
  coordinate, with respective MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure
  procedures and responsibilities are met.
  6.3.10. (AETC) HQ AETC/A3FV will consolidate all AETC FMP pre-publication review
  inputs and provide MAJCOM position to lead command or FMM, as appropriate.
6.4. Lead MAJCOMs:
  6.4.1. Are advocates for their assigned flight manuals and must respond to issues addressing
  status and use. Advocacy includes planning, programming, and budgeting for designated
  flight manuals and assisting in development of digitization strategy for FMs. Lead commands
  will:
     6.4.1.1. Fund flight manuals needed by all using commands.
     6.4.1.2. Ensure all assigned flight manuals for which the PM is responsible are addressed
     in the MDS/weapon system-specific CAFTOP annex and associated TO Information
     Spreadsheet (TOIS).
     6.4.1.3. Prioritize identified flight manual requirements with using commands in the
     yearly Technical Order Requirements Plan (TORP). The TORP translates the PMs/SPD
     CAFTOP Annex and TOIS into a year-by-year summary of requirements through the
     Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). This prioritization will take into account both the
     availability of funding and how the allocation of funding impacts lead and using
     command war-fighting capabilities.
     6.4.1.4. Determine the relative priority of out-of-cycle requirements submitted outside of
     the TORP process with using commands and whether or not each will be funded.
     6.4.1.5. Coordinate with all affected MAJCOMs prior to approving changes to aerial
     refueling procedures for publication.
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                           27


     6.4.1.6. Verify that all using MAJCOM routine and emergency recommended changes
     concur/non-concur responses have been forwarded to the FMM and affected
     MAJCOM(s) and ensure the respective FMM has all the submitted recommended
     changes prior to the FMRC (electronic posting and notification will suffice in both cases).
     6.4.1.7. Support the FMP acquisition process in accordance with the requirements of TO
     00-5-Series.
     6.4.1.8. Coordinate with all using commands prior to approving changes and
     supplements.
     6.4.1.9. Coordinate with AAC/AQY on all recommended changes to MDS-specific -34
     series tech orders that impact specific weapons.
     6.4.1.10. Determine MDS specific distribution requirements and procedures IAW 00-5-
     Series TOs and fully coordinate these procedures with the SPO, FMM and using
     MAJCOMs. Flight Manual products may be disseminated either electronically i.e.
     ETIMS or through approved conventional means. In extenuating circumstances electronic
     distribution may include the use of encrypted e-mail or posting and download from an AF
     approved secure web site or CoP in accordance with AFI 33-Series publications, however
     this is not the normal AF distribution method. At no time can unclassified/unencrypted e-
     mail be used for restricted distribution or classified data. DOD Public Key Infrastructure
     (PKI) encryption, as implemented in the Air Force Common Access Card (CAC), may be
     used to disseminate unclassified restricted distribution and proprietary data.
     6.4.1.11. Host a CoP that provides a single source for management of its AF Form 847
     FM change request for all other MAJCOMâ€™s coordination.
     6.4.1.12. Coordinate with the other component services Lead organizations and FMMs to
     establish Joint use FMs (e.g. NATOPS) when required. MAJCOMs must balance
     component requirements with the AF requirements stated here in AFI 11-215 and other
     service component guidance. Include in the coordination and process development:
        6.4.1.12.1. Flight manual engineering authority, publication, review (quality
        assurance), distribution and change processes as outlined in this AFI and AFJI 21-
        301.
        6.4.1.12.2. Flight manual funding line of authority if it differs from AFJI 21-301.
        6.4.1.12.3. Modification flight manual publication, review, distribution and change
        process as applicable to test aircraft.

                        FLIGHT CREWMEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES

7.1. Flight crewmembers will:
   7.1.1. Follow FMP publications, authorized supplements, and associated checklists during
   aircraft operations.
   7.1.1. (AETC) When conducting flight operations, aircrew members will have on board the
   aircraft copies of USAF FMs as directed by AFI 11-2MDS specific Volumes 3. International
   aircrew will use USAF checklists, redacted based on applicable foreign disclosure
   restrictions and coordinated with the Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO). USAF crewmembers
   will use the â€•  un-redactedâ€– checklists. USAF (un-redacted) paper checklists will be the
   primary document used in the event of an emergency. Prior to each sortie, the Operations
   Supervisor (Ops Sup) will ensure the USAF aircrews are briefed on the differences between
   the USAF and redacted flight manuals, as well as pertinent foreign disclosure issues. Letter
   of Xâ€™s are not required.
   7.1.2. Flight crewmembers will make write-in references to each affected paragraph in flight
   manuals to direct attention to current supplements. Make write-in changes to checklists as
   specified in the interim supplement in full, if practical. Pencil write-ins or typed stickers are
   authorized to accomplish write-in changes to pages. Write in changes can also be performed
   by using software programs that allow text edit/over write functions.
   7.1.2. (AETC) Write-in changes for corrections to title pages, list of effective pages (LEP),
   and references throughout the FMs are authorized. Ensure the appropriate FMM is aware of
   discrepancies.
   7.1.3. Flight crewmembers may make notes in their individually assigned flight manuals and
   checklists. Highlighting of important information in personally issued paper flight manuals is
   permissible.
   7.1.3. (AETC) Only use information and procedures derived from current FM, MAJCOM-
   approved publications, or guidance to operate AETC aircraft. When conducting flight
   operations, aircrew members must have the FMs, checklists, and publications required
   according to current guidance. Insert only current, approved checklists and information
   guides in aircrew abbreviated checklist binders.
      7.1.4. Keep personal flight manuals and checklists current.
   7.1.4. (AETC) FM currency will be determined by referring to the most current list of
   effected pages, listing provided by the supplement status page attached to safety or
   operational supplements or the supplement status or flyleaf page incorporated in the FM.
   Make write-in entries to latest status and flyleaf page reflecting current listing of
   publications, including interim supplements. Determine currency of checklist by referencing
   the status or flyleaf page attached to supplements or the list of effective pages within the FM.
   Crewmembers will complete a LEP check of all technical orders and checklists annually and
   according to TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System, and paragraph 8.1.2 of the basic. To
   replace missing FM pages or checklists, units are authorized to use photocopies until
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                         29


  replacement pages are obtained. This includes printed copies from other digital files and may
  include write-in changes.
  7.1.5. Recommend FMP publication changes on AF Form 847 (or electronic change process
  request) as required.
  7.1.5. (AETC) For updates, revisions, and suggestions, send a copy of the AF Form 847
  through command channels to the AF Form 847 program manager at 19 AF/DO, who will
  review and forward it to HQ AETC/A3FV.

 ELECTRONIC FLIGHT MANUALS, LIST OF EFFECTIVE PAGES (LEP) CHECKS,
                       AND DIGITAL DATA

8.1. General. Approval of electronic in-flight viewing of flight manual data will be delegated to
MAJCOM/A3 through the Stan/Eval function. Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
is the minimum acceptable level of digitization, for primary crew positions (i.e., pilot, navigator,
weapon systems operator, flight engineer, loadmaster, boom operator, etc.). Apply this minimum
standard when using digital data as the primary source for accessing and using flight manuals (to
include electronic checklists) for flight through an e-tool (electronic kneeboard, COTS computer,
electronic flight bag, etc.). The SGML standard is set to provide an enterprise level model to be
used with ETIMS Common Viewer/Transformer. PACAF and USAFE will coordinate, with
respective MDS Lead Commands, an appropriate process to ensure procedures and
responsibilities are met.
   8.1.1. Approval for in-flight use of any type of personal electronic device (e-kneeboard or
   COTS computer) for viewing flight manuals (including checklists) in flight will be obtained
   prior to use. These devices must be certified and approved in accordance with AFI 11-
   202V3, General Flight Rules.
   8.1.1. (AETC) AETC aircrews are authorized to use electronic in-flight viewing of FM data
   (E-Pubs) according to provisions allowed in AFI 11-2, MDS-specific Volume 3s. Coordinate
   with HQ AETC/A3FV to ensure a single source is used for digital FMs for all like MDS
   units. Specify the equipment in local guidance with a reference to the applicable approving
   authority. Note: The E-Pubs consists of FMs, AFIs and their AETC supplements,
   addendums, checklists, concept of operations (CONOPS), and other publications deemed
   necessary for flight operations.
   8.1.2. LEP checks are a comparison of the page and change numbers on each page of a FM
   with the data on the LEP.
       8.1.2.1. LEP checks are mandatory when changes and revisions to paper FMs are posted.
       When changes are posted, only the changed pages must be checked. When a revision is
       posted, all pages in the FM must be checked. If a digital TO file is used to print a FM
       then the FM will have an LEP posted.
       8.1.2.1. (AETC) This requirement also applies to checklists because they are classified
       as abbreviated TO FMs. LEP checks are mandatory during initial and/or annual FCIF
       library inventory checks. LEP checks performed during posting of a FM revision (not a
       change or supplement) satisfy the requirement for an annual LEP check. Checks
       performed during posting of a change or ISS/IOS do not satisfy the requirement for an
       annual LEP check.
       8.1.2.2. When FMs are distributed in both paper and digital format (e.g. IPDF/PDF) the
       LEP check will be entered in the Remarks window of the corresponding ETIMS
       (formerly ATOMS) record for the TO for the digital file and must be recorded on the
       paper copy. LEP discrepancies found in paper or digital will be reported to the FMM
       immediately. Discrepancies on PTOs will be reported to the FMM indicated on the title
       page of the PTO.
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                            31


      8.1.2.3. LEP checks on digital FM files are only required when the TODO/TODA
      electronically posts (merges) a digital FM change file into the baseline FM file, to verify
      that the two files were properly merged (no pages omitted, duplicated, inserted in the
      wrong place, or deleted pages left in the file). The LEP check must be performed using
      the FM intended viewing software application as prescribed by the FMM (do not print a
      copy of the FM file to perform the LEP check).
      8.1.2.4. Annotate the title page or LEP with the date, type â€•(annual/revision or change),
      and reviewer initials, as well as any discrepancies (missing pages, improper printing,
      etc.). For digital FM files, enter this data in the Remarks window of the corresponding
      ETIMS (formerly ATOMS) record for the FM or in the FM Notes of the corresponding
      FM in the ETIMS (formerly ATOMS) database. Discrepancies found on the LEP page
      will be reported to the FM Manager by the AF Form 847. LEP checks are required for
      commercial manuals with LEPs. Page checks are required for brief manuals or COTS
      manuals without LEPs.
8.2. MAJCOM Responsibilities.
   8.2.1. MAJCOMs will establish policy and standardized programs to manage the distribution
   and verify currency of electronic flight publications issued to aircrew members.
   8.2.2. MAJCOMs will establish policy to ensure printing complete flight manuals from the
   digital file is limited to a case-by-case basis to prevent configuration control problems and
   minimize excessive printing cost (NOTE: print cost for flight manuals are accounted for in
   the publication budgeting (CAFTOP) process). Printing small quantities of replacement
   pages is encouraged in lieu of requisitioning the entire flight manual. Any local printing will
   be accomplished using print qualities as outlined in paragraph 2.3.1. In addition, in the
   future some flight manuals may be sent digitally and printed on demand via the Distribute
   and Print Gateway through the Document Automation and Product Service (DAPS) Centers
   in coordination with the FMMs or print specialist working for the FMMs.
   8.2.2. (AETC) OG/CCs are delegated oversight responsibility for the printing of complete
   FMs.
   8.2.3. The primary source for digital FMs is the TO Account subscription on ETIMS
   (formerly JCALS/Web ATOMs) and in the future GCSS. Alternate sources of distribution
   are the Communities of Practice (CoP) Web Pages as long as all FM data is updated and
   verified with the ETIMS source data.
      8.2.3.1. This method may be used with all unclassified, restricted distribution data,
      whether technical or not, including preliminary, interim and formal TOs, TCTOs,
      engineering data and competition sensitive data.
      8.2.3.2. Data to be uploaded or downloaded is sent through a secure â€•
                                                                          tunnelâ€– between
      the CoP server and individual PCs. Refer to 00-5-series of TOs for additional CoP
      distribution requirements.
   8.2.4. Unit commanders will determine the proper mix of paper and digital flight manual
   copies. Sufficient flight manual copies must be available for mission planning
   (commensurate with available computer viewing resources), in-flight operations and personal
   study.
32                                              AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011


  8.2.5. Personal copies of flight manuals may either be paper or digital copies as long as
  compliance with this chapter is met. Units that issue digital copies on portable storage
  devices (i.e. PDA, memory sticks, laptops, etc.) are required to establish a system of control
  to ensure distribution statements and data at rest requirements are met.
  8.2.6. Identify procedures and policy for marking and storage of digital TO/media on all
  devices (i.e. portable storage devices, including laptops, PDAs, thumb drives, etc.) IAW 00-
  5-series TOs.
  8.2.6. (AETC) Mark portable storage devices with the highest distribution statement of the
  data stored and encrypt when at rest due to high theft potential.
  8.2.7. MAJCOMs who elect to permit the use of an e-tool for displaying flight manual
  information will establish policy and procedure for use and include it in the MAJCOM
  supplement. Specifically address the following topics in the MAJCOM supplement:
     8.2.7.1. Approved flight manual (or checklists) format for the e-tool display and crew
     position, who will use the device and the eTool FM update management process.
     8.2.7.1. (AETC) AETC units will forward a listing of the material accessed via E-Pubs
     through 19AF/DO to HQ AETC/A3FV.
     8.2.7.2. Approved flight certified model and type of the e-tool to be used by
     crewmembers.
     8.2.7.2. (AETC) AETC units will forward a listing of hardware used for E-Pubs through
     19 AF/DO to HQ AETC/A3FV.
     8.2.7.3. If an e-tool is authorized for displaying flight manual information by the
     MAJCOM, applicable paper flight manuals will be available on the aircraft to ensure data
     redundancy (in case of viewing device failure). If a certified weapon system IETM is
     approved by Air Force weapon system PM/FMM and is acquired for use, MAJCOMs
     will establish a backup system (either e-tool or paper copy) for viewing FMs in flight. In
     the case where paper is used as a backup, MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure
     paper copies are properly maintained and posted concurrently with electronic version.
     This does not apply to aircraft which do not produce or use paper products, although they
     will ensure redundancy of an e-tool in case of viewing device failure.
     8.2.7.4. All available formats of a TO or TO update (paper, digital medium, electronic
     file) must be released concurrently to maintain TO configuration control. When dual
     paper and digital flight manual media exist, these media will be distributed concurrently
     by the FMM to all users to avoid data mismatch or obsolescence. If the FMM is unable to
     release both types of media concurrently, then using commands will be notified.
     8.2.7.5. Electronic and paper checklists should be maintained concurrently. However,
     MAJCOMs may establish procedures to allow use of one medium with the other medium
     non-current provided operators are notified and aware of the difference. MAJCOMS will
     establish which checklist will be used as primary reference.
         8.2.7.5.1. Some MDS may employ integrated electronic checklists uploaded into
         aircraft computers and viewed on aircraft displays (FMS) as the primary reference in-
         flight (in contrast to removable viewing devices such as a laptop, electronic
         kneeboard, PDA, etc.).
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                             33


          8.2.7.5.2. There may be cases where the paper copy of the integrated electronic
          checklist (Flight Management System, FMS) update is not available for reference
          before flight. If a new software push to the aircraft was accomplished and the paper
          copies do not arrive at the same time, MAJCOM Stan/Eval offices will coordinate
          with the FMM to obtain and print an updated paper copy of changes from a FMM
          source site and distribute accordingly (this responsibility may be delegated).
   8.2.8. When approving digital data for in-flight use, MAJCOMs must consider whether
   human factors/human effectiveness issues have been addressed in the electronic display for a
   specific data format and limit use where appropriate.
8.3. (Added-AETC) Unit Responsibilities. Units electing to participate in the aircrew E-Pubs
initiative will ensure:
   8.3.1. (Added-AETC) The program is managed by the unit OG/OGV.
   8.3.2. (Added-AETC) A dedicated computer is in a convenient location to allow aircrew
   members to expeditiously update the media used. The file to update from will not reside on a
   shared network to allow access during system crashes. Units will ensure the file is scanned
   daily for viruses.
   8.3.3. (Added-AETC) All aircrew members carry and use the appropriate paper checklists.
   Paper checklists will be the primary document used in the event of an emergency. The use of
   electronic FMs in- flight will be for reference purposes only. Exception: aircraft with a
   certified weapon system IETM approved by Air Force weapon system PM/FMM.
   8.3.4. (Added-AETC) Any publications review conducted as part of an evaluation by
   aircrew members includes:
       8.3.4.1. (Added-AETC) A check for currency.
       8.3.4.2. (Added-AETC) Evaluatees demonstrate ability to navigate through and locate
       information in the electronic media.

               RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO FMP PUBLICATIONS

9.1. General. Configuration control of a weapon system is managed by the weapon system PM
or SPD. The PM/SPD has ultimate approval authority for changing flight manual content.
Submit recommended changes to FMP publications on AF Form 847 (use approved forms
available on the AF Publishing Website, http://www.e-publishing.af.mil or utilizing electronic
change process requests through the Enhanced Technical Information Management System
(ETIMS)), when available, according to the procedures below. When the ETIMS electronic
change process is available and implemented throughout a MAJCOM, it will be the only method
authorized for changing flight manuals.
   9.1.1. Submit emergency recommended changes for conditions that require immediate
   correction to prevent fatality, serious injury to personnel, extensive damage or destruction of
   equipment or property or inability to achieve or maintain operational posture. Submit routine
   reports for conditions that are potentially hazardous from prolonged use, have negative
   effects on operational efficiency; reduce operational life or general service use of equipment.
   9.1.2. Do not use the AF Form 847 (or electronic change process request) to call attention to
   line/word omissions, typographical, printing or quality errors usually corrected during
   scheduled reviews unless they cause misinterpretation or affect comprehension.
   9.1.3. The PM/SPD will ensure that all data having potential impact on the FMP that are
   generated from Quality Deficiency Reports (QDR), Engineering Assignments, Mishap
   Investigations, TCTO(s), modifications are routed through the FMM for proper evaluation.
   9.1.4. Use only one AF Form 847 (or ETIMS, electronic change process) when the identical
   change proposal affects both the basic flight manual and its abbreviated checklist. Units will
   submit AF Form 847s electronically. Every effort should be made to ensure the originator is
   informed of the disposition of each recommended change at each level of the approval
   process. If the recommended change is too large to fit onto one AF Form 847, note this on
   the submitted form and provide an attached word document or an edited version (using text
   editing/over-writing software) of an electronic copy of the FM or checklist.
   9.1.4. (AETC) When a recommendation applies equally to other aircraft FMs or TOs,
   indicate the other publications affected in AF Form 847, block 17.
9.2. Processing Routine Recommended Changes.
   9.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 (or ETIMS electronic change process request)
   through MAJCOM channels as outlined in their supplement (if applicable) to this instruction,
   in accordance with routing as outlined in Attachment 2 and in compliance with the
   instructions in Attachment 3. NOTE: Except for those weapon systems for which the NGB
   is lead command, all NGB units must send recommended changes to their gaining MAJCOM
   Stan/Eval office through the numbered Air Force (NAF) (or its equivalent), as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement. Information copies should be sent electronically to
   NGB/A3O@ang.af.mil. When electronic transmission is not possible, mail them to:
   NGB/A3, 1411 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, 22202.
36                                            AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011


     9.2.1.1. (Added-AETC) The stan/eval function at the group (OG/OGV) will ensure AF
     Forms 847 are submitted when required information is missing, incorrect, or not available
     in current guidance. Program success is based on education, advertisement, and proper
     routing. The number of submissions is not a consideration.
     9.2.1.2. (Added-AETC) Any person may submit a routine AF Form 847. Submit AF
     Form 847 from squadron level and below, to the squadron stan/eval for coordination and
     to the OGV for action. Units outside of the squadron or without a stan/eval function will
     submit directly to the OGV. If required, attach documentation that clarifies the
     recommendation, concurrence, or non-concurrence.
     9.2.1.3. (Added-AETC) The OGV, NAF, and MAJCOM will maintain a control log of
     AF Forms 847 processed using the OGV-assigned unit number in block 2 (Attachment 3,
     basic publication). Control logs are optional elsewhere. OGVs are encouraged to use the
     following method to assign unit numbers: OG identifier-year-sequential # regardless of
     MDS. Example: Two AF Forms 847 are submitted from Randolph AFB TX, one for a T-
     6 FM and one for aT-38C AFI. The sequence numbers would be 12-11-01 and 12-11-02.
     Do not include squadron or MDS identifiers in the control number assigned by the OGV.
     Forward all AF Form 847s (regardless of concurrence or nonconcurrence) to the AF
     Form 847 program manager at 19 AF/DO within 15 calendar days. Do not forward to
     AETC/A3FV, 19 AF/DO will do that after review. Exception: AF Forms 847 concerning
     unit-level publications do not require higher headquarters action.
     9.2.1.4. (Added-AETC) The 19 AF/DO AF Form 847 program manager will log in the
     form, coordinate with the appropriate subject matter expert for action, submit it to 19
     AF/DO for final NAF action, and then forward it to HQ AETC/A3FV (regardless of
     concurrence or nonconcurrence). HQ AETC/A3FV will log in the form, coordinate with
     the appropriate subject matter expert for action, and submit it to the HQ AETC/A3FV
     branch chief for final AETC action. HQ AETC/A3FV will review the form and
     coordinate it (as appropriate) with the FMM, lead and using MAJCOMs, or OPR. HQ
     AETC/A3FV will send information copies reflecting the AETC position on the form to
     the AF Form 847 program manager at 19 AF/DO and the submitting OGV.
     9.2.1.5. (Added-AETC) The        HQ      AETC/A3FV       Web      site   https://www-
     r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/A3FV.asp lists the status of AF Forms 847. Final closing action on
     AF Forms 847 to FMP publications is either nonconcurrence by HQ AETC/A3FV, the
     FMM, or the FMRC, or approval by the FMM or the FMRC. Final closing action on AF
     Forms 847 to other publications is nonconcurrence by HQ AETC/A3FV or the OPR, or
     approval by the OPR. Receipt of the formal change to the affected document or written
     authority from the responsible headquarters is the only authority for implementing
     changes or revisions.
     9.2.1.6. (Added-AETC) AFRC units, under AETC oversight, will submit AF Forms
     847 to the applicable AFRC NAF/DOV for review and then forward to HQ
     AFRC/DOVS.
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                        37


  9.2.2. There are instances where AF Form 847 change request could affect adjustment,
  configuration, modification, repair, servicing, and operational checkout of aircraft weapons
  systems and related equipment thus affecting corresponding maintenance TOs. In these
  cases forward a copy of the change request to the MAJCOM/A4 functional OPRs for their
  review.
  9.2.3. Authority for disapproving a unit-submitted recommended change rests with the
  parent MAJCOM. All disapproved recommendations will be posted on MAJCOM CoP for
  AF Form 847 coordination or returned to the unit, in either case they must include
  justification annotated on the AF Form 847 (or CoP) stating the reason for the disapproval.
  Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs, but may be
  forwarded for additional considerations if desired. Disapproved recommendations may be
  resubmitted with additional justification under a new control number.
  9.2.4. Using MAJCOMs have 30 days to comment on recommended change suggestions.
  Comments on the AF Form 847 suggestions will be forwarded to the lead MAJCOM or
  posted on the lead MAJCOM CoP for AF Form 847 coordination. Lead commands will
  ensure all submitted recommended changes are forwarded to (or posted for review/action
  with notification) the FMM prior to the FMRC. Any MAJCOM disagreements will be
  resolved at the next FMRC.
  9.2.5. When the recommended change reaches the FMM, the FMM will forward it to the
  MDS ALC/PC engineering function for review (if required). If the lead and all using
  MAJCOMs have approved the change, the FMM may either publish the recommended
  change or hold the recommended change for the next FMRC, based on its urgency and
  MAJCOM requirements. If the FMM disapproves the recommendation either before or at the
  FMRC or it is disapproved by an engineering review conducted by an ALC/PC MDS
  engineering function, the FMM will annotate the justification for disapproval and return the
  form to the submitting MAJCOM (by posting on FMMs CoP) and address the disposition in
  the FMRC minutes.
  9.2.6. The FMM will notify the submitting MAJCOM of the disposition of all recommended
  changes by posting on the FMM CoP, in the minutes of the FMRC, and if required by e-mail
  within 30 days of receipt.
  9.2.7. Individuals should not submit an AF Form 1000, IDEA Innovative Development
  through Employee Awareness Application, in conjunction with changes to flight manuals.
  Submitting this form to change flight manuals may delay processing of valid recommended
  changes. This action may result in potentially hazardous condition, inefficient operational
  practices, or reduced equipment life. Individuals desiring recognition through the Air Force
  IDEA Program may submit a confirmatory suggestion (after-the-fact) in accordance with
  AFI 38-401, paragraph 3.9.1.
  9.2.8. The recommended change and routing process for ATP-56 flows differently than the
  normal AF Form 847 process and can be found in the ATP-56 manual. All previous
  paragraphs within this section (9.2) apply to recommending changes for flight manuals and
  include the FMM as the final approval authority. However the final approval authority for
  the ATP 56 is HQ AMC/A3VK. HQ AMC/A3VK will notify the MC/HC-130, KC-135,
  KC-10 and KC-45 FMMs of the approval/rejection of recommended changes that affect these
  FMs prior to ATP-56 publication/changes.

9.3. Emergency Generated Recommended Changes.
     9.3.1. Submit an emergency recommended change in the same manner as with routine
     submission. Mark the â€• under block 5 of the AF Form 847. Route emergency AF Forms
                            yesâ€–
     847 as in Table 9.1. Forward information copies as with routine AF Forms 847.
        9.3.1.1. Emergency recommended changes will be sent to the parent MAJCOM (or
        FOA), with an information copy to the MDS FMM.
        9.3.1.1. (AETC) AETC units will submit an emergency AF Form 847 to HQ
        AETC/A3FV and 19 AF/DO with an information copy to the appropriate FMM, and then
        verify that HQ AETC/A3FV received the message.
        9.3.1.2. Originating MAJCOM/FOAs/DRUs or MAJCOMs/FOAs receiving emergency
        recommended changes from subordinate units, must send approved emergency
        recommended changes to the weapon system FMM, AFSC/SEF and all using
        MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs operating the same aircraft within 48 hours after receiving the
        original submission. Other affected MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs must send their concurrence
        or comments to the FMM (with information copies to the submitting MAJCOM and
        AFSC/SEF) within 48 hours after receipt.
        9.3.1.3. The originating MAJCOM/FOA/DRU must send disapproved or downgraded (to
        routine)   emergency      recommended      changes     (including justification for
        disapproval/downgrading) to the initiating unit, the FMM, AFSC/SEF and other using
        MAJCOMs. The originating MAJCOM/FOA/DRU must process downgraded
        recommended changes as routine.
        9.3.1.4. The FMM must inform all MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs and government agencies
        using affected TOs of intended action on emergency recommended change within 60
        hours after receipt. If a recommended change is disapproved or downgraded, the FMM
        must include justification for this action.
        9.3.1.5. If any command has not received notification of the FMMs intended actions
        within 60 hours after its original approval message, they will take follow-up action within
        12 hours.

9.4. Safety Investigation Generated Recommended Changes. Safety investigation generated
recommended changes must originate from a formal safety investigation. This includes mishaps
defined as Class A, Class B, Class C or Class E and events such as High Accident Potential
(HAP) and Hazardous Air Traffic Reports (HATR).
   9.4.1. Recommended changes generated as a result of an aircraft mishap will be written by
   the Safety Investigation Board (SIB) and submitted electronically to the parent MAJCOM
   Stan/Eval function of the mishap aircraft. IAW 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports,
   and when requested the MAJCOM Stan Eval office will provide a tracking number to the
   SIB. The parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval function will make a determination if the
   recommendation requires immediate (emergency) action.
   9.4.2. Annotate the AFSAS ID number in the unit identification portion of the AF Form 847
   for all safety investigation generated AF Forms 847 and check â€•  yesâ€– under block 5. The
   AFSAS number will be the primary means of identifying safety investigation generated AF
   Forms 847. If the safety investigation generated AF Form 847 is also an emergency
   submission, annotate "EMERGENCY RECOMMENDATION" as the first entry in Block 17.
   9.4.3. Forward all emergency generated recommended changes submitted as a result of a
   mishap investigation in accordance with Attachment 2 and paragraph 9.3. Forward
   information copies to MAJCOM/SE and AFSC/SEF, 9700 G Ave SE, Kirkland AFB, NM

TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
Automated TO Management System (ATOMS)â€”ATOMS is a web/PC-based relational
database application designed to assist with maintaining TO Distribution Office (TODO) TO
requirements and distribution records.
CAUTIONâ€”Is an operating procedure, technique, etc., which could result in damage to
equipment if not carefully followed.
CoP (Air Force Knowledge Now)â€”Is a web-based, collaborative workspace where members
use communication tools to conduct business, manage a project, keep abreast of important group
issues and solve group problems. Because CoP data transfers through a secure "tunnel" between
the server and the user's PC, they have proven a very useful way to post and distribute data.
Many TO managers now use CoPs to augment the distribution of unclassified, restricted
distribution data, whether technical or not, including preliminary, interim and formal TOs,
TCTOs, engineering data and competition sensitive data.
Distribution Statementâ€”A statement used in marking a technical document, regardless of
publication media or form, to denote the extent of its availability for distribution, release, and
disclosure without additional approvals and authorizations from the controlling DoD office (see
AFI 61-204).
((Added-AETC) E-Pubsâ€”An electronic publications library consisting of FMs, Air Force
Instructions (AFI) and their AETC supplements, addendums, checklists, concept of operations
(CONOPS), and other publications deemed necessary for flight operations.
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                           47


Electronic Flight Bagâ€”is an electronic information management device that helps flight crews
perform flight management tasks more easily and efficiently with less paper. It is a general
purpose computing platform intended to reduce, or replace, paper-based reference material often
found in the aircrew's carry-on Flight Bag, including the Flight Manual, AFIs, and Navigational
Charts (including moving map for air and ground operations). In addition, the EFB can host
purpose-built software applications to automate other functions normally conducted by hand,
such as performance take-off calculations.
Electronic Technical Manual (ETM) (Type 1)â€”A manual containing technical data authored
in a linear fashion for the purpose of page or in-line presentation (Type 1). ETMs may have a
wide range of functionality ranging from indexed raster, hypertext linking, multimedia,
interactivity between the data and the user, procedural guidance, navigational directions, and
supplemental information. ETMs may also contain operational-support functions supplemental
to procedures and are displayed according to TMSS specifications.
Enhanced Technical Information Management System, (ETIMS)â€”Enhanced Technical
Information Management System (ETIMS) is intended to become the Air Force (AF) primary
tool to support warfighters by providing focused, timely, accurate, and complete technical
information in digital form at the point of use. When complete, ETIMS will allow personnel
involved in all of the major business process areas of the Technical Order (TO) system
(managing, acquiring, sustaining, distributing, storing, and using TOs) to carry out their
responsibilities and access their required data using current Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)
technology.
Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM): (Type 2)â€”An "information oriented",
digital technical manual whose format and style are optimized for computer presentation. IETM
organization facilitates easy user access to technical information while the display device
provides interactive procedural guidance, navigational directions, and supplemental information.
It is technical data authored in a non-linear fashion for the purpose of non-linear presentation.
IETMS have the following characteristics: allow a high level of interactivity between the data
and the user providing procedural guidance, navigational directions, and supplemental
information; may provide assistance in carrying out operational-support functions supplemental
to procedures. It is displayed in non-linear data form according to MIL-DTL-87268C.
IPDF/PDFâ€”Indexed Portable Document Format (Adobeâ„¢).
Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS) Systemâ€”The JCALS
System is a joint service, distributed technical management information system.
Lead Commandâ€”The Air Force assigns responsibility for overall management of each system
to a â€•lead commandâ€– to ensure that all requirements associated with every system receive
comprehensive and equitable consideration. The lead command provides a primary input into the
process of developing and maintaining a force structure with a balance of complementary
capabilities, and it establishes a basis for rational allocation of scarce resources among
competing requirements. When only one command uses a weapon or equipment system, it is
automatically assigned Lead Command. See AFPD 10-9 for aircraft systems and AFI 10-901 for
communication and information systems assignments. NOTE: Is an operating procedure,
technique, etc., which is considered essential to emphasize.
 48                                               AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011


Program Manager (PM)â€”As used in this instruction applies collectively to System Program
Director, Product Group Manager, Supply Chain Manager or acquisition program manager.
Formerly Single Manager (SM). The designated individual with responsibility for and authority
to accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the
user's operational needs. The PM shall be accountable for credible cost, schedule, and
performance reporting to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) in accordance with DoD
5000.1, The Defense Acquisition System.
Shall, Will, Shouldâ€”In TOs the word â€•  shallâ€– is used to express a provision that is binding. The
words â€• shouldâ€– and â€•  mayâ€– are used when it is necessary to express non-mandatory provisions.
â€•Willâ€– may be used to express a mandatory declaration of purpose or when it is necessary to
express a future event.
STINFOâ€”Scientific and Technological Information.            Information relating to research,
development, engineering, testing, evaluation, production, operation, use, and maintenance for
military products, services, and equipment for military systems. This includes production,
engineering, and logistics information.
System Program Director (SPD)â€”The individual in a SPO who is ultimately responsible and
accountable for decisions and resources in overall program execution. SPD is the designated title
for the program manager of a program that reports to a Program Executive Officer
(PEO)/Product Center Commander during the acquisition phase, or an ALC/CC during system
sustainment, and who presents the single face to the user while overseeing the seamless life-
cycle processes.
Technical Content Manager (TCM)â€”The individual, usually an Equipment Specialist (see
definition) or Engineer, responsible for maintaining the accuracy, adequacy, modification,
classification, review and currency of the technical content of TOs and TCTOs supporting
assigned systems, commodities or processes. TCMs are not generally responsible for style and
format or other non-technical aspects of manuals.
Technical Dataâ€”Recorded information, regardless of form or method of recording, of a
scientific or technical nature. Information that can be used, or adapted for use, to design,
develop, assemble, engineer, produce, manufacture, modify, operate, repair, test, overhaul,
maintain, or reproduce equipment and related technology.
Technical Manual (TM)â€”A document that contains operational or maintenance instructions,
parts lists or parts breakdown, or other related technical information or procedures (exclusive of
administrative procedures) for a weapon system, weapon system component, support equipment
or other item procured by DoD. This data can be presented in any form (for example hard copy,
audio and visual displays, magnetic tape, disks, or other electronic devices).
Technical Order (TO)â€”TMs developed to MIL SPECs or commercial manuals reviewed and
approved in accordance with MIL-PRF-32216 "Evaluation of Commercial Off-The-Shelf
(COTS) Manuals and Preparation of Supplemental Data, managed in the Air Force TO System,
and meeting the criteria for TMs listed above. The term Technical Order is equivalent to the
DoD term Technical Manual.
TO Managerâ€”The TO Manager is responsible for managing some or all of the TOs for a
specific military system or commodity program. Management responsibilities include
acquisition, sustainment, format, publishing, storage and distribution of TOs and related
AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011                                                        49


technical data IAW AFPD 21-3, AFI 21-303, and 00-5-series TOs. When acquisition is being
performed at a product center, and sustainment will be managed at an ALC, the PM will ensure
TO logistics supportability issues are coordinated with the candidate ALC TO Manager to assure
compliance with applicable technical data guidance. During system sustainment, many of the
below functions are performed by TCMs, Distribution Managers, and other support functions as
delegated.

 52                                             AFI 11-215_AETCSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2011


Section 1:    The first level is the submitting organization group/wing (or detachment)
              Stan/Eval function. Indicate whom the form will be forwarded to (i.e.NAF or
              MAJCOM). Annotate the appropriate level of concurrence. If you agree with the
              intent, but not the wording, then mark â€•  CONCUR WITH INTENTâ€– and annotate
              the recommended wording in the remarks section.
Section 2:    The second level of review is reserved for NAF. They comply with the same
              instruction as outlined above. If there is no NAF function then the second section
              is left blank.
Section 3:    The third level of review is reserved for MAJCOM use. MAJCOMs will assign
              their control number (i.e., AETC 01-130) in block 3 on the front side of the form.
              If the submitting MAJCOM is lead command, then they annotate their command
              in the â€• LEAD MAJCOMâ€– block and forward copies to using commands of that
              MDS. If the submitting MAJCOM is not lead, they annotate who is lead and
              forward the original and information copies to the lead and using commands. Any
              AF Form 847 submitted by a using command and disapproved by the lead
              command will automatically be forwarded to the FMRC for final resolution. Lead
              MAJCOM forwards all coordinated AF Forms 847 to the FMM
Section 4:    The final level of review is reserved for the FMM or if the recommendation is for
              an instruction, the action officer responsible for the instruction. For flight
              manuals, if the using commands have concurred with the recommendation, the
              FMM will indicate â€•    CONCURâ€– and hold the recommendation for incorporation
              into the next change (or revision). If the FMM determines the recommendation
              cannot be accepted in its present form but still has merit the FMM will indicate
              â€•CONCUR WITH INTENTâ€– or â€•           FORWARD TO _____________________FOR
              REVIEW AND/OR ACTIONâ€– (Lead MAJCOM with recommended review
              and/or action) or hold the recommendation for the next FMRC. The FMRC will
              be the final resolution authority for disputed recommendations. If the
              recommendation requires additional review (i.e., engineering), the FMM will
              forward the form to the appropriate office and mark that block. The FMM (or
              final approval authority) must notify the submitting MAJCOM as to the final
              status and disposition of the recommendation within 30 days of receipt.
NOTES:
1. If an AF Form 847 is initiated at or above the wing/group level review and coordination
documentation will begin in Section for the next approving level. Blocks in unused lower levels
will be left blank. An AF Form 847 originating from an intermediate level of review (i.e., the
NAF level) will complete Section 2 and forward to the next level.
2. Recommendations submitted as emergency or as a result of a safety investigation will follow
the procedures outlined in Chapter 9.
