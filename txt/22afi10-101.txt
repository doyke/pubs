                                                                                            Pages: 9

This instruction implements Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Mission Directive 1118, Headquarters
Fourth, Tenth, and Twenty-Second Air Forces, Air Force Reserve Command Instruction (AFRCI) 10-601,
Mission Needs and Operational Requirements, and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-202V1, Aircrew Train-
ing. It establishes the 22 AF Combat Planning Council (CPC) membership, working groups, meeting
dates, procedures, duties and responsibilities. The CPC advises the 22 AF/CC on training and equipment
issues. The CPC will be a tool for the commander to ensure command assigned AFRC units are trained
and equipped to maintain operational readiness according to the applicable gaining command standards,
as directed by the above mission directive. This instruction applies to all unit equipped and associate 22
AF units.


1. Organization/Tasks. The CPC will be organized to address training and equipment requirement
issues across all weapons systems/missions and by individual mission area. The permanent working
groups listed below are the minimum specified. The 22 AF/A2A3 may establish temporary working
groups to address specific issues.
   1.1. Broad Area Working Groups. To address issues across all weapons systems/missions, the CPC
   will have three standing Broad Area Working Groups:
       1.1.1. Training Working Group. This working group will be composed of operations officers and
       training officers (or their equivalent) from all units, intelligence officers/Non Commissioned
       Officers (NCO) with training responsibilities and members of the 22 AF Operations Training staff.
       Members of the AFRC Operations Training staff will be invited as advisers. A member of the 22
       AF Operations Training staff will be the Training Working Group Chairman. The working group
       will consider the following:
           1.1.1.1. Unit issues, open tasks from previous CPCs;
           1.1.1.2. Issues generated by the ACC Realistic Training Review Board (RTRB).
2                                                                         22AFI10-101 28 MARCH 2007


           1.1.1.3. After Action Reviews from current contingency or Air Expeditionary Force (AEF)
           operations. NOTE: The working group is not limited to these issues and may also consider
           issues affecting all units, training inputs to the Status of Resources and Training System
           (SORTS) and use of the Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS). The output of the
           working group will be to share common problems and solutions across all mission areas.
           When solutions cannot be found, the working group will generate tasks for the mission area
           working groups or the 22 AF Operations Training staff.
       1.1.2. Weapons and Tactics Working Group. This working group will be composed of weapons
       and tactics officers (or their equivalent) from all units, intelligence officers/NCOs from units with
       a weapons and tactics function and members of the 22 AF Weapons and Tactics staff. Members of
       the AFRC Operations Training staff with weapons and tactics responsibilities and AFRC repre-
       sentatives from the Air Force Reserve/Air National Guard Test Center (AATC) and the Advanced
       Airlift Tactics and Training Center (AATTC) will be invited as advisers. A member of the 22 AF
       Weapons and Tactics staff will be the Weapons and Tactics Working Group Chairman. The work-
       ing group will consider the following: unit issues:
           1.1.2.1. Open tasks from previous CPCs;
           1.1.2.2. Issues generated by the ANG/AFRC Weapons and Tactics Conference;
           1.1.2.3. After Action Reviews from current contingency AEF operations, munitions forecast-
           ing/expenditure and airspace/ranges. NOTE: The working group is not limited to these issues
           and may also consider Tactics Improvement Proposals (TIP) if required as part of the Num-
           bered Air Force (NAF) Tactics Review Board (TRB) process. The output of the working group
           will be to share common problems and solutions across all mission areas. When solutions can-
           not be found, the working group will generate tasks for the mission area working groups or the
           22 AF Weapons and Tactics staff.
       1.1.3. 22 AF/A2A3 Requirements Consolidation Working Group. This working group will be
       composed of 22 AF unit operations group commanders or their designated representatives. The 22
       AF/A2A3 is the chairman. Members of the 22 AF/A2A3, HQ AFRC/A3T, USAF/REOR, AFRC/
       A5R, AATC, and AATTC staffs will be invited as briefers and advisers. The output of this work-
       ing group is:
           1.1.3.1. A consolidated, prioritized list of the top equipment requirements from the mission
           area working group lists.
NOTE: The working group will consider the previous year’s CPC Top Requirements List and the status
of current AFRC requirement projects. At a minimum, the group will consider the top five items from
each mission area list, but is not limited to the top five items. The group will give priority to items appro-
priate for funding with 0350 or National Guard/Reserve Equipment Account (NGREA) funding but may
place other items on the list to emphasize their relative merit to senior AFRC leadership. The group may
use the current AFRC Reserve Requirements Oversight Council (RROC) ranking spreadsheet from the
mission area groups as a tool, but the final list should be a subjective ranking based on combat capability.
    1.2. Mission Area Working Groups. To address specific mission area issues, the CPC will have nine
    standing mission area working groups:
       1.2.1. C-5 Working Group. This working group will be composed of officers from all 22 AF C-5
       units and members of the 22 AF Operations Training and Weapons and Tactics staffs. Members of

4. Meeting Schedule. CPC meetings will be held annually in the summer. The 22 AF/A2A3 will set the
meeting date. Factors to be considered will be the date of the ANG/AFRC Weapons and Tactics Confer-
ence, MAJCOM TRBs and the AFRC requirements planning timeline in AFRCI 10-601. Normally, the
CPC will be scheduled after the Weapons and Tactics Conference to allow information from that confer-
ence to be used at the CPC. The CPC should be scheduled early enough in the year to allow for require-
ment information to be input into the AFRC process prior to the first of the year. This timing may force an
earlier TIP/TRB process. To facilitate travel, the CPC should be scheduled for a Tuesday through Thurs-
day with the following breakdown:
    4.1. The CPC will begin on Tuesday morning with opening remarks from the 22AF/A2A3. The morn-
    ing session will consist of informational and administrative briefings to include: conference agenda,
    unit capabilities, Rules of Engagement (ROE), local area security, COMSEC/OPSEC, and any other
    briefings or issues determined by the 22AF/A2A3 Staff to be beneficial to the conferees.
    4.2. Training and Weapons and Tactics personnel will meet on Tuesday afternoon in preparation for
    the following days breakout meetings. The training and weapons groups should hold separate meet-
    ings during the same time frame for half of the day.
    4.3. A CPC general session will be held Wednesday morning prior to the start of the Mission Area
    Working Groups. Members of the USAF/REOR, AFRC/A5R, AATC, and AATTC staffs will be
    invited as briefers and advisers. They will brief the members of all working groups on the status of all
    studies and analysis, engineering, and acquisition programs by mission area. The members will be
    briefed on the most current three-year’s Reserve Acquisition Priority List (RAPL). The briefings
    should be scheduled prior to breaking up for the individual working groups. The members will take
22AFI10-101 28 MARCH 2007                                                                               9


   this information to their respective working groups so they may make informed project validation and
   priority decisions. The agenda will protect a minimum of a four-hour block for the working groups.
   4.4. Thursday will be dedicated to finishing working group agendas and a formal outbrief by each
   working group chairman. The outbrief will be scheduled as a general session and may be attended by
   the 22 AF/CC. This session should be scheduled to end by noon to facilitate travel. The 22 AF/A2A3
   Requirement Consolidation Working Group will meet after the general session is adjourned.

5. Planning Cycle. The planning cycle is intended to be a general checklist for CPC execution and is not
all-inclusive. The planning cycle for each new CPC begins at the end of the previous with a review of cri-
tiques. That means the CPC and this instruction will evolve and change.
   5.1. Last Day of CPC: Collect critique forms and compile suggestions for changes.
   5.2. Within 30 days: Prepare and distribute minutes, tasking list, and executive outbrief.
   5.3. Quarterly: Review CPC Tasking List for progress and update suspense's.
   5.4. 15 Jan (six months prior): Select CPC project officer and begin date selection process.
   5.5. 15 May (60 days prior): Set and announce CPC dates; begin coordination for facilities and billet-
   ing; begin draft agenda.
   5.6. 15 Jun (30 days prior): Confirm working group chairmen; begin work group agendas.
