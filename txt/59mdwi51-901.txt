This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 51-9, Civil Law for Individuals. This
instruction provides procedures for Airmen and civilians assigned to the 59th Medical Wing
(59 MDW) concerning off-duty employment. This instruction applies to all personnel assigned
or attached to 59 MDW. This instruction does not apply to the Air National Guard, Air Force
Reserve, or contract personnel. Refer recommended changes and questions about this

1. Overview. The United States Air Force has first call upon the talent and time of all military
personnel 24 hours a day. Airmen assigned to the 59 MDW must understand their first
responsibility is to their duties within the Air Force Medical Service. Off-duty employment must
be approved and must not interfere with Airmen’s duties and responsibilities. Off-duty
employment that might generate a responsibility for continuing medical care of patients will not
be approved. Individual healthcare providers on off-duty employment must comply with local
licensing requirements and Drug Enforcement Agency requirements, and must provide their own
personal liability coverage. The Air Force is not responsible for the actions of individuals
working in off-duty employment. Air Force personnel will not engage in outside employment,
or other outside medical services, without prior approval.
2. Requirements.
