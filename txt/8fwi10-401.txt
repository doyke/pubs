1. General. This instruction provides a system to expeditiously pass critical information to
personnel assigned to Kunsan Air Base. The primary method of recalling personnel is through
the PRS, backed up by the base Giant Voice system, a wing-wide e-mail, At Hoc alerts and info
posted to the Commander’s Access Channel. It is the responsibility of each organization to
develop and keep a current Pyramid Recall Roster (PRR) that will facilitate the immediate recall
of their assigned personnel. Notifications via the PRS will include only essential, unclassified
information. All information related to a recall is privileged and releasable only on a need-to-
know basis. Notifications will be accomplished rapidly to limit information available to a
potential enemy.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Commander, 8th Fighter Wing (8 FW/CC) will:
        2.1.1. Determine the type and method of recall and will direct the 8th Fighter Wing
        Command Post (8 FW/CP) to activate the PRS.
        2.1.2. Ensure a copy of the 8 FW Staff PRR and communication outage (Comm-Out)
        map is sent (via the 8 FW/CCK) to the 8 FW/CP via encrypted e-mail or FAX (782-7255)
        by the first Friday of every month or whenever they are updated.
        2.1.3. The 8 FW CPTS UCC will serve as the recall focal point for the 8 FW Staff
        agencies and CPTS.
     2.2. Each Group Commander will:
        2.2.1. Ensure subordinate organizations develop, maintain and update PRRs and Comm-
        Out recall procedures and maps, as personnel changes require.
        2.2.2. Designate primary and alternate group recall monitors.
        2.2.3. Maintain current copies of PRRs for subordinate organizations.
        2.2.4. Ensure organizations in their chain of command are notified in the event of a
        recall.
8FWI10-401 10 JUNE 2013                                                                         3


   2.3. Each Organization will:
       2.3.1. Update and maintain a current PRR and Comm-Out roster with maps for off-base
       addresses of all military assigned personnel.
       2.3.2. Develop procedures to ensure all unit personnel are notified as quickly as possible.
       The goal is to have all notifications occur within 40 minutes of recall start time and have
       all personnel arrive at duty locations within 1 hour.
       2.3.3. Assign recall monitor(s) to update the PRRs as personnel changes happen. Unit
       recall monitors will also maintain and update their unit’s PRR in Unit Level/Unit
       Command and Control (UL/UC2).
           2.3.3.1. All organizations (Unit recall monitors) assigned to Kunsan AB will send
           copies of their updated PRR to their group commander’s office (if applicable) by the
           first and third Friday of each month or whenever they are updated.
           2.3.3.2. All PRRs should use Attachment 3 as an example; organization name, date,
           and all pertinent information regarding unit personnel should be updated and a
           privacy act statement IAW the Privacy Act of 1974 should be included on the PRR.
           2.3.3.3. Information should be established to ensure all personnel are notified and the
           names of any individuals not contacted should be upchanneled through the
           responsible UCCs. It is the organization’s responsibility to continue to try and
           contact anyone not contacted in the initial notification and to give strength reports
           until they have 100% accountability of all personnel in their organization.
           2.3.3.4. When recall notifications are made, special instructions should be given
           immediately after the notification. Notifications will include only essential,
           unclassified information. All information related to a recall is privileged and
           releasable only on a need-to-know basis. Accomplish the notifications rapidly to
           limit information available to a potential enemy.
2.3.4. Responsible UCCs will provide hourly strength reports using UL/UC2 based on the recall
start time. Refer to 8 FWI 36-2101 para 2.8.3 and Attachment 3 for reporting personnel in Other
Category to Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR).
       2.3.5. UCC representatives are trained on recall and strength reporting procedures using
       UL/UC2. Contact the UL/UC2 office at 782-5222 to schedule any required training.
       2.3.6. Each organization performing a stand-by or on-call commitment will also send a
       letter (using Attachment 4 as an example) to the 8 FW/CP via e-mail or FAX (782-7255)
       whenever information is required to be updated.
       2.3.7. Develop procedures to ensure all tenant organizations assigned, as identified in
       Attachment 5, are notified in a timely manner.
       2.3.8. Ensure personnel shred obsolete versions of unit PRRs to protect the privacy of
       unit members and practice good operations security (OPSEC).
   2.4. The 8 FW/CP will:
       2.4.1. Maintain procedures to initiate the appropriate PRS type and method as directed
       by the 8 FW/CC or designated representative.
 4                                                                 8FWI10-401 10 JUNE 2013


        2.4.2. Initiate or conduct tests of the PRS as directed by the 8 FW/CC or designated
        representative.

        designated representative to obtain 8 SFS assistance in notifying key personnel.
        2.4.4. Serve as the focal point for initiating wing-wide recalls and reporting using
        UL/UC2.

        2.5.1. Ensure BDOC assists in notifying key wing personnel in the event of a Comm-Out
        recall.
     2.6. Personnel Assigned to will:
        2.6.1. Members will provide the organization recall monitor with pertinent recall
        information as determined by the unit commander (such as residence address, residence
        telephone number, work telephone number, pager number (if applicable), and cell phone
        number (if applicable)).
        2.6.2. All military and emergency/contingency essential civilian personnel will inform
        the organization orderly room of address and/or telephone number changes as changes
        occur.

        personal contact only. Strength reporting will be accomplished by the organization’s
        recall monitor physically going to the UCC. The UCC will then send a messenger to the
        ICC with a strength report.
