                                                  AFSC 1A0X1
PART I
Preface
1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document
   that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task
   requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor
   in all aspects of career field training.
2. The CFETP consists of two parts; both of which are used by management to plan, manage, and control training
   within the career field.
   2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains how
   everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career progression information, duties and responsibilities,
   training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications
   (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds,
   manpower, equipment, and facilities. Note: The Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI
   36-2101 Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) contain the specialty descriptions.
   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes
   duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted
   training, and correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the course objective list and training
   standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfy training requirements. Section C identifies
   available training support materials. Section D identifies a training course index that is used to determine
   resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses. Sections E and F
   identify MAJCOM unique training requirements.
   2.3. Attachment 3 to the electronic version of the CFETP is a career path chart. This chart provides a visual
   depiction of the In-flight Refueling AFSC, Career Enlisted Flyers Incentive Pay gates and years of aviation
   service, and key information to education, training and qualification. It also contains promotion information
   specific to the In-flight Refueling AFSC, such as average time in grade, time in service, as well as Air Force
   averages. This chart provides a timeline for achieving additional qualifications such as instructor, evaluator,
   FTU assignment, and leadership opportunities within the squadron, Group, Wing and MAJCOM and HQ/USAF.
3. This CFETP is designed to ensure individuals in AFSC 1A0X1 receive comprehensive and effective training at
   the appropriate phases of their career. At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and
   conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Section A - General Information
1. Purpose.
This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM
functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage,
and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the training that individuals
must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. For the purpose of this plan, training is
divided into four areas: initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training
(CT). Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air
Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory
courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 5-, 7-, and
9-skill levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a
specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is
designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job. Continuation training is
additional training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to
personnel to maintain their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required. The CFETP has several purposes,
some are:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialty and recommends
training and education throughout each phase of an individual's career.
1.3. Lists courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired specialty training program.
2. Uses.
The CFETP will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training
programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty.
2.1. AETC training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, and exportable training based
on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP. The lead command MFM will
work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified
training.
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills
requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable
courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must
not duplicate available training resources.
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of courses in
Part II will be used as a reference to support training.
2.4. Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623).
All training is certified via AF Form 8 by trained flight examiners. Certification on the AF Form 8 eliminates the
requirement to document STS items in this CFETP.
3. Coordination and Approval.
The AFCFM is approval authority. MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify and
coordinate on the career field training requirements. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document
and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they
will eliminate duplicate training. Send applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM Functional
Managers to HQ USAF/A3O-AM, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1480 or the following
organizational email address: afa3oam.workflow@pentagon.af.mil

5. Skill/Career Progression.
Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an extremely
important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission. Therefore, it is essential that everyone involved
in training do their part to plan, develop, manage, conduct, and evaluate an effective and efficient training program.
The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure individuals receive viable training at the appropriate
points in their career. The following narrative and the AFSC 1A0X1 career field flow charts identify the training
career path. They define the training required in an individual’s career.
5.1. Apprentice 3-Level. Completion of the Aircrew Fundamentals Course and Boom Operator Basic Initial
Qualification Course at Lackland AFB, TX is mandatory for pipeline and non-aviation service cross training
students. Initial skills training in this specialty consists of the tasks and knowledge training provided in the resident
apprentice course located at either the KC-135 Boom Operator Initial Qualification Course at Altus AFB, OK or the
KC-10 Boom Operator Initial Qualification Course at Travis AFB, CA or McGuire AFB, NJ. Task and knowledge
training requirements are identified in the Specialty Training Standard. After weapon systems qualification training
is complete, the trainee will work with the trainer to enhance their knowledge and skill.
5.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Non-prior service trainees must meet all requirements prescribed in the applicable
MAJCOM aircrew training directives and a minimum of 12 months upgrade training beginning on the first day of
Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Completion of IQT is required. Individuals in retraining status are subject to
the same training requirements and a minimum of nine months in upgrade training.
5.3. Craftsman (7) Level. Upgrade training to the 7-skill level in this specialty consists of holding at least the grade
of SSgt and 12 months of upgrade training. Individuals in retraining status are subject to the same training
requirements and a minimum six months in upgrade training.

                                                                                                  CFETP 1A0X1
                                                                                               31 December 2012
5.4. Superintendent (9) Level. Upgrade training to the 9-skill level in this specialty consists of holding the rank of
SMSgt, meeting mandatory requirements listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI
36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) and having supervisor’s recommendation.
5.5. Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM). CEM code is awarded when selected for promotion to Chief Master
Sergeant.
6. Training Decisions.
The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training
requirements for the Boom Operator career field. This CFETP was developed to include life-cycle (day one through
retirement) training requirements for this specialty. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to
meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and
eliminate a disjointed approach to training.
6.1. Initial Skills Training. Initial physiological training will be conducted at the Aircrew Fundamentals Course.
Only minor changes were made to the specialty training standard to align common core training across all 1AXXX
AFSCs.
6.2. Five Level Upgrade Training. Completion of 12 months of upgrade training starting on the first day of IQT.
Individuals in retraining require completion of nine months of upgrade training starting on the first day of IQT.
Completion of CDCs is no longer required for 5-skill level upgrade.
6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training. No formal training. The CSAF has approved a variance, eliminating the
requirement for in-residence 7-level training for all Career Enlisted Aviator personnel.
7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs.
CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Sciences (AAS) Degree. Enrollment in CCAF
occurs upon completion of basic military training. Off-duty education is a personal choice but is highly encouraged.
See the CCAF web site for program details regarding the AAS degree at: http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf .
Additionally, see the Air Force Virtual Education Center website regarding AAS degree progress at:
https://my.af.mil/afvecprod/. In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following:
7.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. The CCAF offers the Occupational Instructor Certification to
instructors teaching full time in a CCAF affiliated school. To qualify, instructors must complete an instructor course,
a Teaching Practicum, have two years teaching experience, hold an associate or higher degree, and be recommended
by their commander/commandant.
7.2. Instructor of Technology & Military Science Degree. This program is offered to enlisted members who are
assigned to CCAF affiliated schools teaching CCAF degree-applicable courses. Applicants must complete three
semester hours of CCAF-approved instructor methodology coursework and hold their career-field related CCAF
degree or equivalent civilian college degree before registration.
7.3. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification is awarded for
the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a competency based assessment process for trade skill
certification at one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman/Supervisor, or Master
Craftsman/Manager. All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.
7.4. Degree Requirements. All Airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program. The current associate’s
degree program available from the CCAF for AFSC 1A0XX is the Aviation Operations (4VCB) degree. Prior to
completing an associate degree, the 5-skill level must be awarded and the following requirements in Table 1 must be
met.

1. Implementation.
This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning January 2013.
2. Purpose.
As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, this STS:
2.1. Lists in column 1 of attachment 2, the tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to
perform in the 3- and 5-skill level AFSC in the In-Flight Refueling Specialist ladder of the Aircrew Operations
Career Field. These are based on an analysis of the duties listed in Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory
(formally known as AFMAN 36-2108).
2.2. Column 2 (3-Skill Level) shows formal training and correspondence course requirements as described in the
Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) web site at: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ and the career
knowledge provided by the correspondence course. There are no CDCs listed for this AFSC.
2.3. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of
training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.
2.4. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training and used according to AFI 36-2201, Air
Force Training Program. For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means
the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and
correct use of procedures.
2.5. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airmen Promotion System (WAPS).
Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields develop the Specialty Knowledge Tests
(SKTs) at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter
areas judged by test development team members to be most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Individual
responsibilities are in AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force.
3. Recommendations.
Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to 37 TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Street, Suite 1,

Section B - Course Objective List
4. Measurement.
Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written
test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W
indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance
progress check.
5. Standard.
The standard is 85 percent on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the
objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the
progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is
attained.
6. Proficiency Level.
Most task performance is taught to the “1a” proficiency level which means the students can do simple parts of the
task, but needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task (extremely limited) or to a “2b” proficiency level
which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task
(partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.

 ** A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
    (Examples: b and 1b)

*** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject
    common to several tasks.

  -    This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course.

 x     This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.
