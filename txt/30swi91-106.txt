Supersedes 30SWI91-106, 30 December 1998                                                    Pages: 19

This publication establishes the criteria, procedures, and responsibilities for development, usage, and con-
trol of Toxic Hazard Zones (THZ). This publication applies to all operations that involve toxic propellants
or toxic combustion byproducts, and to facilities that store, handle or transfer unconventional propellants.
THZ procedures and controls used to support the release of other hazardous materials will be consistent
with the policies described in 30th Space Wing (30 SW) Plan 32-4002, Hazardous Materials Emergency
Response Plan, Appendix 2, Section B, Toxic Hazard Corridor Plan. The procedures described herein,
when implemented, will provide the appropriate safety clear areas for storing, handling and transferring of
unconventional propellants, and will provide for protecting workers and the general public during vehicle
processing and launch operations. Refer recommended changes and questions about this supplement to 30
SW/SE, 806 13th Street VAFB 93437-5230 using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publica-
tions. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained
in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and dis-
posed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Throughout the publication, changes to office symbols were made and specific acronyms were updated
(e.g, EOC for DCG and SLCC for SCMDR). Table 1., Exposure Criteria on which Toxic Hazard Zones
are based, has been updated. Cold and Hot Spill roles have been clarified (paragraph 4.1.). All references
to vapor protected shelters or VPS have been deleted – determined by discussion amongst 30 MDOS/
SGOAB and 30 SW/SE. A bar (|) indicates changes since last revision.


1. Responsibilities. Responsibilities detailed in this instruction vary depending upon the type of opera-
tion and the resulting toxic hazard zone. Those responsibilities are described in detail in the appropriate
sections. Responsibilities for implementing this instruction are:

    1.1. 30 SW Safety Office (30 SW/SE). Ensures procedures described herein meet safety standards for
    all applicable operations.
    1.2. Base Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) (30 MDOS/SGOAB). Provides guidance on the expo-
    sure criteria and protective measures described herein.
    1.3. Users (e.g., 4th Space Launch Squadron (4 SLS), commercial launch contractors, etc.). Incorpo-
    rates the user requirements described herein into governing operating procedures and provides fund-
    ing for unique requirements.
    1.4. Other Agencies (e.g., Command Post, 30th Security Forces Squadron (30 SFS), 30th Weather
    Squadron (30 WS), 30th Civil Engineer Squadron (30 CES), 2d Range Operations Squadron (2
    ROPS)). Ensures resources are available and procedures are in place to meet their requirements
    described herein.

2. Sheltering Requirements. The following defines acceptable mission essential personnel sheltering
for each zone for Cold Spill and Hot Spill Potential Hazard Zones (PHZ). These definitions apply across
all propellant types.
    2.1. Zone 1. Sheltering is recommended only for individuals especially sensitive to low levels of
    industrial odors.
       2.1.1. Immediately enter any vehicle or structure if breathing discomfort is noticed.
       2.1.2. Close all windows.
       2.1.3. Close all air intake vents.
       2.1.4. Await “all clear” from On-Scene Commander or his/her representative before leaving the
       site unless an emergency situation requires immediate evacuation.
    2.2. Zone 2. If an individual notices breathing discomfort or skin irritation, they will be directed to
    take shelter or evacuate by the LST Chief pre-launch, and by the Emergency Operations Center
    (EOC) Director post-disaster. Protective actions would include taking shelter indoors or moving out
    of the zone.
       2.2.1. Shelter must be fully enclosed with no open areas. Motor vehicles with engines off and
       windows and vents closed do qualify as adequate sheltering.
       2.2.2. Close all windows.
       2.2.3. Turn off all air recirculation devices.
       2.2.4. Close all air intake vents.
       2.2.5. If exiting a Zone 2 in a vehicle, emergency egress Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE)
       (i.e., Emergency Life Support Apparatus (ELSA)) should be worn only if safe to do so while driv-
       ing since PPE can obscure vision and limit motor skills. Also, their limited air supply may neces-
       sitate the removal of the hood while in motion. For these reasons, while driving, PPE should only
       be worn to escape an immediate threat to life (Zone 3) that requires a traverse through noticeable
       toxic clouds.
       2.2.6. If in a vehicle and not in an emergency situation, the vehicle is to be kept stationary to pre-
       vent inadvertent transit of a Zone 3.
30SWI91-106 3 JULY 2007                                                                               3


      2.2.7. Await "all clear" from EOC Director or designated representative before leaving the site
      unless an emergency situation requires immediate evacuation.
   2.3. Zone 3. Wearing approved PPE, or having approved PPE readily available is mandatory for per-
   sons in Zone 3 PHZ. During a launch countdown, it is recommended that personnel be evacuated from
   a Zone 3 PHZ. Personnel may be allowed to remain in a Zone 3 PHZ only if they have approved PPE,
   their risks are acceptable, and their evacuation would impact the mission (e.g., LST has no back-up
   position to support the launch). Wearing of approved PPE is mandatory for persons in an Operational
   Hazard Zone (OHZ).
      2.3.1. Personnel must wear approved PPE or have approved PPE readily available as specified in
      the governing operation procedure.
      2.3.2. Await “all clear” from the EOC Director or designated representative before leaving the
      site unless in an emergency situation.

3. Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) Development Criteria.
   3.1. Exposure Limits. Table 1. lists the exposure limit criteria to be used in computing all forms of
   THZs. These values have been derived from the expert elicitation study conducted in FY99 and FY00.
   The expert elicitation study was performed by a panel of nationally recognized toxicologists, includ-
   ing Air Force representatives, wherein upper and lower bound exposure thresholds were recom-
   mended for HCl, NO2 and HNO3. Any variances to these limits must have the prior approval of 30
   MDOS/SGOAB and 30 SW/SE before their use in an operational THZ. Where two exposure criteria
   are listed for one of the tiers, the one producing the longer THZ will be used.
   3.2. Potential Hazard Zone (PHZ) Valid Times. The valid time for cold spill PHZs must not exceed
   two hours.
   3.3. Updates. Cold spill Emission Hazard Zone (EHZ), OHZ, and PHZs must be updated as source
   strengths or meteorological conditions change, at intervals not to exceed 45 minutes for EHZs and 90
   minutes for PHZs. OHZs must be updated at intervals not to exceed 15 minutes, or until emergency
   conditions are terminated by the EOC Director or Launch Support Team (LST) for OHZs.
   3.4. Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) Computation Timelines. As a baseline, operation decisions based
   upon THZs are to be made with cold spill PHZs computed and given to the requester at T-150 min-
   utes; and hot spill PHZ and OHZs at T-105 minutes, and T-45 minutes for launch operations. Compu-
   tations based on T-0 weather data will be made and used as an OHZ if an accidental release occurs.
   These timelines are specified in the Range Safety Operation Requirements (RSOR) and can change
   based upon operation requirements.

       HOS personnel at directed checkpoints during propellant operations.
    4.2. Operations Requiring Cold Spill PHZs. The following operations require cold spill PHZs to be
    determined (other operations may require PHZs if deemed necessary after analyzing planned opera-
    tion):
       4.2.1. Transferring propellants, where more than 5 gallons may be released, from one storage,
       missile or spacecraft vessel to another, at tank farms, launch complexes, or servicing or mainte-
       nance facilities.
       4.2.2. Initial pressurization of propellant systems that contain more than 5 gallons.
       4.2.3. Transporting or mechanical handling (e.g., lifting) propellants in quantities exceeding 5
       gallons.
       4.2.4. Propellant system maintenance (unless engineering analysis confirms PHZ will not exceed
       local control area or system is leak free).
NOTE: For paragraphs 4.2.3. and 4.2.4., the following requirements do not apply: sheltering require-
ments in paragraph 2.; notification requirements in paragraph 4.1.; responsibility requirements in para-
graph 4.4.
    4.3. Cold Spill PHZ Input Data Requirements. 30 WS requires the following data to compute the
    PHZ:
       4.3.1. Time, location and altitude above ground level of potential release location.
       4.3.2. Propellant type.
       4.3.3. Source strength, in gaseous emissions of pounds per minute, wetted area in square feet, or
       total pounds or gallons of liquid released if the wetted area is unknown.
           4.3.3.1. Source strengths must be determined for all modes of use, storage, transportation and
           venting of propellants on Vandenberg AFB. They must be based on the worst-case credible
           cold spill release scenarios or worst-case emission rates for venting.
           4.3.3.2. Source strength determinations, assumptions, calculations, and test data must be doc-
           umented in the Missile System Prelaunch Safety Package (MSPSP), Launch Complex or
           Facility Safety Plan, or Ground Operations Plan. Each facility will provide worst-case credible
           release strength information to the 30 WS for planning purposes. This information is subject to
           30 SW/SE review and approval.
           4.3.3.3. For minor releases, source strengths may be used to determine set evacuation dis-
           tances in lieu of calculating EHZs if approved by 30 SW/SE and coordinated with 30 MDOS/
           SGOAB. Supporting rationale and determined evacuation distance must be documented in the
           MSPSP, Launch Complex or Facility Safety Plan, or Ground Operations Plan. Any limitations
30SWI91-106 3 JULY 2007                                                                                 7


         (wind speed, wind direction, etc.) which invalidate the determined evacuation distance must
         be documented in the procedure governing the release operation.
  4.4. Actions Required for Cold Spill PHZs. The requester of the cold spill PHZ has the following
  responsibilities:
     4.4.1. Maintain positive control of personnel within Zone 3 during an operation. These personnel
     must either wear PPE, have emergency egress PPE readily available and be able to safely evacuate
     outside the Zone 3. They must be briefed on the operation in progress and on evacuation routes.
     The governing operation procedures will specify how the above conditions will be satisfied.
     4.4.2. Ensure personnel within Zone 2 have:
         4.4.2.1. An emergency evacuation route. If the evacuation route passes through Zone 3 or
         approaches the source location, PPE must be readily available.
         4.4.2.2. The means to be immediately notified of an unplanned propellant release.
     4.4.3. Ensure adequate communication is available to all personnel in Zones 2 and 3. Planners
     may use telephone notification, public address, HOS, etc., to comply.
     4.4.4. Inform 30 SW/CP if Zone 2 crosses the airfield flight path, railroad right-of-way, or off-
     shore oil platforms, and if Zone 2 extends beyond base land boundary.
     4.4.5. Hold the operation if Zone 2 extends, or is predicted to extend, over the base cantonment
     area, outside the base land boundary or over offshore oil platforms until risk assessment and
     acceptance (RA) can be performed. If the operation is in progress and updated PHZ extends over
     these areas, secure the operation at a safe point or perform a RA (see paragraph 4.6.) and obtain 30
     SW/CC’s or designated representative’s acceptance of risk. Notify the Command Post if the oper-
     ation is in progress and the updated PHZ extends over these areas.
     4.4.6. Pre-position HOS (Hazardous Operations Support) in the most advantageous location to
     control access to Zone 3 and evacuate personnel, if necessary. HOS will possess emergency egress
     PPE and will have the ability to be contacted directly by the task supervisor.
     4.4.7. Once the operation begins, allow only essential personnel to enter Zone 3. These personnel
     must be briefed on the operation in progress and evacuation routes. They must have emergency
     egress PPE readily available.
     4.4.8. Hold the operation if Zone 3 extends over the Union Pacific railroad tracks until risk assess-
     ment and acceptance (RA) can be performed.
     4.4.9. Controls on personnel transiting Zone 1 are not necessary.
     4.4.10. Personnel transiting Zone 2 must be informed that they are in a PHZ. This may be accom-
     plished via roadblocks, signs, or other notification procedure as approved by 30 SW/SE.
  4.5. Cold Spill EHZ Requirements. The EHZ will be based on the applicable EHZ criteria in Table 1.
  Tiered exposure criteria are not applicable. The requester of the EHZ is responsible for doing the fol-
  lowing:
     4.5.1. Hold the operation if the EHZ extends, or is predicted to extend, over the base cantonment
     area, outside the base land boundary or over offshore oil platforms. If the EHZ encompasses
     Union Pacific railroad tracks, the user will request 30 SW/CP to contact the trainmaster in Guada-
8                                                                             30SWI91-106 3 JULY 2007


       lupe to determine current train schedules. If railroad traffic inside the EHZ is expected during the
       operation, the operation will be held until the train has cleared the area.
       4.5.2. Only essential personnel may remain within the EHZ. These personnel will be protected as
       follows:
           4.5.2.1. Required to wear 30 SW/SE and 30 MDOS/SGOAB approved PPE.
       4.5.3. Notify 30 SW/CP and 30 WS at least 30 minutes prior to beginning the operation and at the
       conclusion of the operation.
       4.5.4. Inform 30 SW/CP if the EHZ crosses the airfield flight path.
       4.5.5. Do not allow personnel to enter or exit the EHZ once the operation begins unless they are
       in 30 SW/SE and 30 MDOS/SGOAB approved SCAPE or other PPE.
    4.6. Facility Cold Spill Engineering Controls and Risk Acceptance for PHZs.
       4.6.1. If the worst-case credible source strength Zone 2 for a facility extends beyond the base land
       boundary, over the base cantonment, or over offshore oil platforms, then one of the following must
       be done:
           4.6.1.1. Implement engineering controls (foam suppression system, covered release contain-
           ment system, etc.) to eliminate or reduce the size of Zone 2.
           4.6.1.2. Limit operation to weather conditions which will keep Zone 2 within the base land
           boundary away from the base cantonment, and away from offshore oil platforms.
           4.6.1.3. If mission need dictates and paragraphs 4.6.1.1. and 4.6.1.2. cannot be followed, per-
           form a RA. If Zone 2 goes over the base cantonment or off-base and over a populated area (see
           Figure 1. for general locations), 30 SW/CC or his/her designated representative will make a
           risk assessment and decide whether or not to proceed with the operation. If Zone 2 goes off
           base but does not overlay a populated area, this RA may be delegated by 30 SW/CC.

NOTES:
The requester must have a database of nearby off-base population areas (houses, ranches, commercial
facilities, etc.). 30 SW/SE can provide geographic coordinates of populated areas upon request.
If the user requests delegation of authority to act upon the risk assessment, he or she should request it in
writing from 30 SW/CC prior to starting the operation.
       4.6.2. Procedures to request RA must be defined in the Launch Complex or Facility Safety Plan,
       or Ground Operations Plan.
       4.6.3. The user must brief all commanders required to make risk acceptance decisions, or their
       designated representatives, on the following minimum information:
           4.6.3.1. Propellant operation requiring THZ.
           4.6.3.2. Engineering and operating controls.
           4.6.3.3. THZ forecasts.
           4.6.3.4. Populated areas at risk. If the Union Pacific railroad tracks are at risk, the latest train
           schedule must be briefed.
30SWI91-106 3 JULY 2007                                                                                 9


          4.6.3.5. Disaster response procedures.
          4.6.3.6. Mission impact if the operation is held.
          4.6.3.7. Extended meteorological forecast.
      4.6.4. New facilities at which unconventional propellants will be stored, processed or used will be
      designed to meet AFSPCMAN 91-710 requirements. Worst-case credible releases will be evalu-
      ated and containment systems will be designed to reduce the source strength values where possi-
      ble and to prevent Zone 2 from exceeding the base land boundary for specific weather conditions.
      These values will be updated as project design changes or modifications occur.
      4.6.5. Modifications to facilities at which unconventional propellants will be stored, processed or
      used will be designed to meet AFSPCMAN 91-710 requirements in addition to the normal
      approval process. Worst-case credible releases will be evaluated and containment systems will be
      designed so the original facility design source strength values are reduced where possible, and/or
      not exceeded by the modification. These values will be updated as project design changes or mod-
      ifications occur.

Figure 1. Offbase Population Centers




      4.6.6. All facilities where unconventional propellants are processed or stored will develop a THZ
      Plan (may be contained in the Launch Complex Plan, Facility Safety Plan, or Ground Operations
      Plan) which will address all applicable portions of this instruction. 30 SW/SE must approve this
      plan.
   4.7. Actions to Take After Accidental Release. If an accidental release were to occur, personnel super-
   vising the operation are responsible for stabilizing the situation as follows:
10                                                                              30SWI91-106 3 JULY 2007


        4.7.1. Initiate evacuation procedures. Acceptable sheltering requirements for each Zone are given
        in paragraph 2.
            4.7.1.1. The PHZs will become the OHZs until more timely information is available on the
            source strength of the actual release or on meteorological conditions. If there is a release when
            a propellant operation is not taking place, the facility worst-case credible source strength will
            be used to calculate the OHZ until more specific information is available.
            4.7.1.2. Task supervisors will direct security forces evacuation.
        4.7.2. Obtain OHZs from 30 WS. 30 WS will disseminate key parameters on the New Tactical
        Forecast System (NTFS).
        4.7.3. Notify Security Forces/Fire Department (call 911 or 734-4117 if calling by cell phone,
        606-3911 when calling from base extension) using the “Reporting Upon Release Discovery” pro-
        cedure outlined in 30 SW Plan 32-4002, Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Emergency Response
        Plan, Chapter 4, Section A, Paragraph 2.
        4.7.4. Notify 30 SW/CP of the OHZ Zone 2 and 3 dimensions and specify if either crosses the air-
        field flight path, offshore oil platforms or railroad tracks.
        4.7.5. If the OHZs Zones 2 or 3 extend off base, 30 SW/CP will notify civilian authorities of the
        release and provide information on the potential public exposure effects and sheltering recommen-
        dations.
        4.7.6. EOC response will be per 30 SW OPLAN 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management
        Plan.

Figure A1.1. Base Cantonment




Hot Spill—Release of toxic propellants through propellant combustion, such as a launch operation.
Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH)—The current National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) definition for IDLH is “a condition that poses a threat of exposure to airborne
contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or delayed permanent adverse
health effects or prevent escape from such an environment.” The level of exposure for the IDLH “is to
ensure the worker can escape from a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of the
respiratory protection equipment.” The effects at these levels are based on an exposure time of 30 minutes
16                                                                           30SWI91-106 3 JULY 2007


to add a safety margin. However, this does not mean workers should stay in that environment any longer
than necessary. Evacuation should take place immediately.
Launch Support Team (LST)—Formed to support launch operations. In the event of a launch mishap or
anomaly, the LST assists the On-Scene Commander (OSC) as 30 SW Safety, Security, and Health
Representatives by providing real time consultation to the OSC per 30 SW OPLAN 10-2.
Hazardous Operations Support (HOS)—Contractor or government personnel charged with providing
hazardous propellant operations security support as directed by the Operations Directive (OD).
Operation-Essential Personnel—The minimum number of personnel required to accomplish a specific
operation.
Operations Directive (OD)—The single formal document designed to consolidate host-base support for
missile and space operations. The OD serves as a combination of support and notification checklist.
Operational Hazard Zone (OHZ)—The toxic hazard zone established following an accidental cold
spill, unplanned liquid or gaseous release, or normal launch or catastrophic launch abort, based upon
actual or worst-case credible source strength. Zones 1, 2, and 3 are established for an OHZ, as appropriate.
Permissable Exposure Level (PEL)—Defined by NIOSH as the time weighted average concentration
that must not be exceeded during any 8-hour work shift of a 40-hour workweek.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)—Breathing apparatus such as Emergency Life Support
Apparatus (ELSA) or Self-Contained Atmospheric Protective Ensemble (SCAPE) designed to protect
individuals from exposure to hazardous chemicals or provide supplemental sources of oxygen. 30 MDOS/
SGOAB and 30 SW/SE will approve all PPE and determine when it is required.
Potential Hazard Zone (PHZ)—Planning zone established prior to a specific operation to assess risk
should an accidental cold spill or unplanned release, or a hot spill catastrophic abort occur. The zones are
based upon the worst-case credible emission rate or source strength for a specific operation. A PHZ may
have a Zone 1, 2 or 3 for nitrogen tetroxide/nitrogen dioxide vapor (N2O4/N02) and hydrochloric gas
(HCl). A PHZ may have a Zone 2 or 3 for hydrazine-family propellants.
Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL)—A short term exposure limit averaged over a 15-minute period
(unless another time limit is specified in a parenthetical notation below the limit).
Short-Term Public Emergency Guidance Level (SPEGL)—The exposure limit expressed in parts per
million (ppm) related to an unplanned single exposure normally lasting 60 minutes or less and never more
than 24 hours, and whose occurrence is expected to be rare.
Threshold Limit Value (TLV)—Refers to airborne concentrations of substances and represents
conditions under which the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)
believes nearly all workers may be occupationally exposed day after day without adverse effect. TLVs are
published by the ACGIH. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) publishes similar
values called Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). The most conservative of the OSHA or ACGIH values
must be used.
Tier 1—An airborne exposure level (maximum concentration) which poses no hazard to the general
population but which may affect certain sensitive individuals (e.g., asthmatics, individuals with
emphysema, and certain other lung diseased people). Tier 1 separates Zone 1 from the area where no
controls are required. See Table 1. for Tier 1 exposure level values.
30SWI91-106 3 JULY 2007                                                                                    17


Tier 2—An airborne exposure level (maximum concentration) which may cause short term symptoms but
which most individuals could endure without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious
health effects or symptoms which could impair their ability to take protective action. Tier 2 separates
Zone 2 from Zone 1. See Table 1. for Tier 2 exposure level values.
Tier 3—An airborne exposure level (maximum concentration) based on the NIOSH IDLH values. Tier 3
separates Zone 3 from Zone 2. See Table 1. for Tier 3 exposure level values.
Time Weighted Average (TWA)—A worker’s average airborne exposure in any 8-hour work shift of a
40-hour work week which shall not be exceeded.
Toxic Combustion Byproducts—During a planned burn of a rocket engine or an unplanned combustion
of propellants, toxic byproducts can be created and/or released which pose a hazard to downwind areas.
The significant toxic byproduct of solid propellant combustion is hydrogen chloride (HCl). Unplanned
combustion, such as an explosion of a vehicle burning hypergolic propellants during flight, can release
toxic vapors. These vapors include hydrazine (N2H4), unsymmetrical dimethyl-hydrazine (UDMH),
monomethylhydrazine (MMH), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The combustion byproducts of aerozine-50
(A-50) released from an explosion of a vehicle fueled by this propellant are N2H4 and UDMH.
Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ)—A generic term which describes an area in which predicted concentration
of propellant or toxic byproduct vapors or aerosols may exceed acceptable tier levels. Predictions are
based on analyzing potential source strength, applicable exposure limit, and prevailing meteorological
conditions. THZs are plotted for potential, planned and unplanned propellant releases, and launch
operations. OHZs, PHZs, and EHZs are types of THZs.
Unconventional Propellants—A propellant fuel based upon chemical reactions, unlike combustion of
fossil or hydrocarbon materials. Typical unconventional propellants at Vandenberg AFB are an oxidizer
(e.g., nitrogen tetroxide) and a fuel (e.g., Aerozine-50) which spontaneously ignite when mixed together,
which is known as a hypergolic reaction.
User—30 SW clients, such as Department of Defense (DoD), National Aeronautical and Space
Administration (NASA), civilian commercial companies, etc., that use 30 SW facilities and test
equipment, or conduct prelaunch and launch operations on the Western Range.
Vandenberg's Integrated Communication Telephone Evacuation Routes (VICTER)—A n
emergency telephone notification system the Command Post manages. The system is primarily designed
to protect personnel on Vandenberg AFB from unplanned propellant releases. Vandenberg AFB is divided
into seven zones based upon building occupancy, proximity to hazardous facilities, prevailing winds, etc.
VICTER is a preset tele-conference net (similar to a Secondary Crash Net) that includes certain buildings
on Vandenberg AFB. Additions to this list only occur when the owner/user of a facility contacts the
Command Post and the 30th Communications Squadron and requests to be added. In case of an
emergency, the Command Post will plot THZ information on maps containing numbered buildings,
facilities, etc. The net is activated and personnel at risk are directed to a specified evacuation route and a
rendezvous location for a Security Forces head count.
Worst-Case Credible Release Strength—Used to facilitate prediction of a cold spill THZ. The
responsible engineer (user) should determine the worst-case credible failure mode, then determine the
associated liquid or vapor release rate (in pounds per minute), or the wetted area (in square feet).
Zone 1—An area where the airborne concentrations of any toxic product are equal to or exceed Tier 1
levels, but are less than Tier 2 levels. This zone can result from either a hot or cold spill. Within Zone 1,
18                                                                           30SWI91-106 3 JULY 2007


sheltering is recommended only for sensitive mission essential individuals and no controls are required to
monitor or prevent personnel from transiting the zone. See Figure A1.2. below.
Zone 2—An area where the airborne concentrations of any toxic product are equal to or exceed Tier 2
levels, but are less than Tier 3 levels. This zone can result from either a hot or cold spill. Within Zone 2,
sheltering is required if an individual notices breathing discomfort or skin irritation. (Note: exposure to
some chemicals (e.g. nitrogen dioxide) at Zone 2 concentration levels may not be immediately irritating
but can have delayed adverse health effects. For these chemicals, depending on the circumstance, a delay
in the operation or evacuation will be required). To protect the general public, an operation is required to
be delayed or ceased at a safe point in the procedure if a Zone 2 region extends beyond base boundaries,
extends over designated public areas on base, or extends over off-shore oil platforms. Certain exemptions
may be permitted under proper authorization if an off-base Zone 2 lies within an uninhabited area. See
Figure A1.2. below.
Zone 3—An area where the airborne concentrations of any toxic product range from a low defined by
Tier 3, to an unknown high. This zone can result from either a hot or cold spill. Within Zone 3 personnel
must either evacuate or wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) or have such equipment
close at hand. In the event of an actual release it is mandatory that personnel wear PPE. Operations are
subject to hold for Zone 3 in the same manner as Zone 2 with the additional requirement that if a Zone 3
region infringes on the Union Pacific railroad tracks the operation is required to hold until a risk analysis
indicates it is safe to proceed or winds shift to move the Zone 3 away from the tracks. See Figure A1.2.
below.
