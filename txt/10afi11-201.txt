primary tool for administering and documenting TP program management.
   1.1. Report any problems associated with the AFRC Automated TP Program, in writing, to 10 AF
   Operations Resource Management (10 AF/A3VF) via email to: 10afdov@carswell.af.mil. 10 AF/

    the purpose of this instruction.

2. Unit Instruction. In addition to AFMAN 36-8001, paragraph 4.11.1.11, commanders will establish
written local guidance for management of AFTPs and AGTPs to include the following:
    2.1. Designate personnel who may authorize AFTPs/AGTPs and procedures for documenting such
    authorization.
    2.2. Specify procedures to validate the AFTP duty period with takeoff and landing data. For single,
    consecutive and dual AFTPs, ensure the recorded AFTP duty period encompasses the takeoff/landing
    times and the pre-flight and post-flight duty times.
    2.3. Specify the process and required documents for verification/certification of AFTPs/AGTPs, Air
    Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document; AF IMT

       Timekeeper Report is forwarded to the appropriate timekeeper.
       2.4.2. Specify procedures to ensure AFTP/AGTP Finance Pay Rosters (AFRC Forms 82) are sub-
       mitted to finance in a timely manner.
    2.5. Specify procedures that verify the AGTP duty period and approved ground events listed on the 10
    AF AGTP Authorization forms (as prescribed in paragraph 6.) match those entered in the AFRC Auto-
    mated TP Program. Ensure:
       2.5.1. The 10 AF AGTP Authorization includes: name, office symbol, date, approval authority
       and ensure time of duty and the period are appropriately documented.
       2.5.2. The recorded AGTP time of duty encompasses authorized duty period permitted.

    accomplishing AFTP/AGTP, including Reserve Pay Office, if appropriate.

3. In-flight Duty Status Conversions. All in-flight duty status conversions must be approved, in
advance, by the Operations Group Commander or designated representative and annotated on the
approved flight authorization order. No more than one duty status conversion may be made in one crew
duty day for aircrew personnel.
    3.1. At home station, there are no further restrictions to in-flight duty status conversions. For attached
    flyers, unit of flying attachment is considered home station for this purpose.
    3.2. Away from home station (i.e., when temporary duty (TDY)), all periods of military duty will be
    scheduled in advance, meet normal Reserve participation requirements and be annotated on official
    orders.

   AFTP/AGTP indicated on the signed document.

5. Training Period Guidelines. Training Period (TP) for Flying Training is a training period for pay,
authorized for an individual in an authorized flying position. The types of TPs for flying-related training
are AFTP and AGTP.
   5.1. Additional Flying Training Period. AFTPs involving airborne duties in an aircraft Mission
   Design Series (MDS) in which the member is authorized to perform flight duties IAW AFMAN
   36-8001, AFRC SUP 1, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Stan-
   dardization/Evaluation Program. With the exception of dual AFTPs and change of duty status
   inflight, all preflight, flight and postflight duties will be included in the duration of the AFTP period.
       5.1.1. Preflight duties begin no later than (NLT) when aircrew “step” to begin aircraft preflight,
       but may be expanded to include the administrative, equipment and briefing activities required for
       the specific flight to be flown. These preflight duties need not include extended mission planning
       activities that occur prior to the flight briefing. The period of training must be a minimum of four
       (4.0) hours in duration with at least one-tenth (0.1) of an hour of flying time logged.
       5.1.2. Postflight duties end not earlier than (NET) 15 minutes after actual landing, completion of
       all post flight duties or four hours after the start of the training period, whichever is later. Post
       flight duties need not include extended mission debriefings that occur after the flight.
   5.2. Single AFTP. A period of training that includes flying for at least one-tenth of an hour and a min-
   imum of four hours continuous duty. Duty begins NLT the required “step” time to begin aircraft pre-
   flight (as per unit supplement applicable MDS, Volume 3) and ends NET 15 minutes after actual
   landing, completion of all post flight duties or four hours after the start of the training period, which-
   ever is later. Post flight duties need not include extended mission debriefings that occur after the
   flight.
   5.3. Consecutive AFTP. Two separate, single AFTPs performed in a single calendar day. Identify each
   sortie on separate line entries on a single AFTO Form 781 if the same aircraft is flown.
   5.4. Dual AFTP. Two continuous flying training periods recorded as a single event. Must be a mini-
   mum of eight (8.0) hours in duration, which includes all preflight, flight and post flight duties.
4                                                                          10AFI11-201 21 JULY 2008


       5.4.1. Dual AFTPs must include no less than three (3.0) hours of scheduled flying time (2.5 hours
       of scheduled flying time for Air Education & Training Command (AETC)/AFRC Associate Pro-
       gram T-1 training sorties). EXCEPTION: To meet unique mission requirements, the OG/CC or
       equivalent may authorize a dual AFTP with less than 3.0 hours scheduled flight time. Examples
       include, but are not limited to, single mission/sortie that credits two Ready Aircrew Program
       (RAP) sorties (e.g. fight-tank-tight), Hurricane evacuation or Rapid Infil/Exfil training missions.
       5.4.2. Dual AFTPs may be accomplished on a single mission/sortie or on several missions/sorties
       within the same flight duty period. Must include two four (4.0) hour training periods in which a
       minimum of one tenth (0.1) hour of flying time is logged in each. Duty beginning and end times
       are IAW paragraph 5.1.
    5.5. Additional Ground Training Period. An event involving approved aircrew related ground training
    activities as documented on the appropriate 10 AF AGTP Authorization forms, IAW paragraph 2.5.
    The period of training will be a minimum of four (4.0) hours of continuous duty.
    5.6. AGTP Authorized Events. Aircrew will document ground training events accomplished during
    the performance of an AGTP on 10 AF AGTP Authorization forms as prescribed in paragraph 6.
    Changes to the event lists are accomplished by the following process:
       5.6.1. Submit requests for changes to 10 AF/A3VF NLT 1 August of each calendar year for inclu-
       sion in the list for the following year.
       5.6.2. Requested changes shall comply with ground training requirements outlined in MDS-spe-
       cific training programs or with the ground training mission elements required by either AETC
       Associate or Formal Training Unit (FTU) syllabi.
       5.6.3. A 10 AF AGTP Review Board consisting of appropriate staff aircrew members will verify
       requirements to perform ground training events using applicable MDS-specific training programs
       or AETC Associate/FTU syllabi. Final approval authority will be the 10 AF Commander (10 AF/
       CC). Approved events will be formatted as 10 AF AGTP Authorization forms, which will be pub-
       lished on the AF e-Publishing website.
       5.6.4. All 10 AF AGTP Authorization forms will be updated or revalidated by the 10 AF/CC,
       annually. Off cycle updates may be made in response to MDS-specific training programs or AETC
       Associate/FTU syllabi changes which affect ground training or mission element requirements.
       5.6.5. The 10 AF Director of Operations (10 AF/A2A3) will provide updated 10 AF AGTP
       Authorization forms to 10 AF units annually, at a minimum.
    5.7. General AGTP Guidelines. An AGTP in lieu of an AFTP may be authorized when a flight cancels
    after the member reports for duty. Preflight duties qualify as approved ground training activities and
    time taken to perform preflight duties count as part of the required four (4.0) hours of an AGTP. Other
    approved training must be accomplished during the remainder of the period. Document training IAW
    paragraph 2.5.
       5.7.1. AGTPs are authorized off station.
       5.7.2. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) attached aircrew approval authority is the immediate supervi-
       sor (or higher) or the attached flying squadron Commander (CC), Director of Operations (DO),
       Assistant Director of Operations (ADO) or Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
