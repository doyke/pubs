            accessibility as the actual spaces from which rescue would be required.
     6.2.5. This training will be conducted initially for each team member and once every 12 months
     thereafter as long as the individual remains on the rescue team.
     6.2.6. Confined Space Tester/Monitor:
12                                                                 911AWI91-301 6 SEPTEMBER 2006


           6.2.6.1. The person designated to conduct tests of confined space atmospheric conditions
           must be trained in the operation, calibration, and care of the specific testing equipment to be

        and either the initials or signature of the trainer and (or) instructor.
        6.3.3. Training will be documented on the workers AF IMT 55 and or Electronic data base.
        6.3.4. Training records will be available for review by the CSPT during annual program evalua-
        tions or spot checks.

7. Entry into Confined Spaces:
     7.1. General:
        7.1.1. The entry supervisor will ensure workers enter a PERMIT-REQUIRED confined space
        only after an AF IMT 1024, Confined Space Entry Permit, has been initiated.
        7.1.2. An entry permit for a specific task in a permit-required confined space must be approved by
        SEG, CEF, and SGPB personnel.
        7.1.3. Where the contaminations are caused by materials or conditions within the space, the entry
        supervisor will identify the cause or source of the contamination and remove it to the maximum
        degree possible by cleaning, ventilating, or other such treatments.
        7.1.4. Where the operations to be conducted within the space introduce (or have the potential to
        introduce) additional hazards within the space, the entry supervisor will ensure these hazardous
        conditions and operations are covered by the permit and take action consistent with the nature of
        the operations to control the hazards and maintain safe conditions within the space.
        7.1.5. The entry supervisor will ensure an attendant is provided for all permit-required confined
        space entry and work.
        7.1.6. The attendant will know the procedure and have the capability to contact the rescue team or
        summon emergency assistance if the rescue team is not stationed immediately outside the con-
        fined space.
        7.1.7. The entry supervisor will authorize entry into the confined space by his or her signature on
        the entry permit and will ensure the following conditions are met:
           7.1.7.1. There is no known potential for an IDLH atmosphere or an engulfment.
           7.1.7.2. The entrants are trained in routine recurring operations practices and procedures
           required for such entries.
911AWI91-301 6 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                        13


        7.1.7.3. The work operations are governed by Technical Order (TO), Operating Instruction
        (OI), or similar directive.
        7.1.7.4. The space is tested for atmospheric hazards.
        7.1.7.5. The permit is revoked whenever any testing required shows conditions in the space
        are more hazardous than contemplated under the permit.
        7.1.7.6. The entry supervisor will stop operations and ensure a new permit is used.
        7.1.7.7. Retain the revoked permit for 1 year.
        7.1.7.8. The permit is revoked when any conditions of the permit are not followed or
        enforced.
            7.1.7.8.1. The entry supervisor may reclassify a permit-required confined space to a
            non-permit confined space at the time of a specific entry.
            7.1.7.8.2. The entry supervisor will not permit entry into and work in known IDLH spaces
            under normal operations.
  7.2. Permits:
     7.2.1. The permit is an authorization and approval in writing that specifies the location and type
     of work to be done.
     7.2.2. The permit certifies that an evaluation of all existing hazards and the necessary protective
     measures have been taken to ensure the safety and health of each worker.
     7.2.3. Entrants will sign the permit indicating an understanding of confined space entry and res-
     cue requirements, and the entry supervisor will sign as the person responsible for the entry. CAU-
     TION: The permit is not valid unless the entry supervisor has signed it.
     7.2.4. If necessary, maintain signatures of workers on a separate document and attach them to the
     entry permit.
     7.2.5. Any problems encountered during an entry shall be noted on The Confined Space Entry
     Permit or attachment –noting what went right with the entry and what went wrong so necessary
     revisions can be made to the confined space program.
     7.2.6. Log in each permit issued for confined space entry on Confined Space Entry Log.
     7.2.7. Each completed entry permit, including those that are canceled or revoked, shall be retained
     for 1 year by the organization responsible for the entry and available for review.
     7.2.8. Entry permits do not have to be posted.
  7.3. Welding, Cutting, and Brazing (Hot Work):
     7.3.1. Whenever workers will perform hot riveting, welding, cutting or burning, or heating oper-
     ations within a confined space, an AF IMT 592, USAF Welding, Cutting and Brazing Permit,
     from CEF must be obtained with appropriate signatures.
     7.3.2. If hazards may be introduced into the confined space due to the “hot work”, the SGPB
     should be contacted to evaluate the potential hazards and recommend ventilation procedures. In
     addition the workers will:
14                                                                911AWI91-301 6 SEPTEMBER 2006


           7.3.2.1. Inspect, test, operate, and maintain welding and cutting equipment such as hoses, con-
           nections, torches, etc., according to the provisions of AFOSH Standard 91-5, Welding, Cut-
           ting, and Brazing, and applicable to TOs.
           7.3.2.2. Not take compressed gas cylinders or gas manifolds used for welding and cutting
           operations into the confined space.
           7.3.2.3. Turn off gas supplies at the cylinder or manifold outside the space when equipment is
           unattended or unused for substantial periods of time, such as at breaks or lunch periods.
           7.3.2.4. At shift changes (30 minutes or more) or overnight, turn off gas supplies and remove
           torches and hoses from the space.
           7.3.2.5. Immediately remove open-ended hoses from the space when torches or other devices
           are removed from the hose.
           7.3.2.6. DO NOT take electric arc units or machines into a confined space. Place such units
           outside the space.
     7.4. Non-Permit Required Confined Space:
        7.4.1. Reclassification to a non-permit required confined space would allow entry without a per-
        mit, without personnel being suited with a harness and (or) a lifeline, and without an attendant,
        provided:
           7.4.1.1. Testing is accomplished prior to entry with the results showing the space to be free of
           all hazards. NOTE: If entry is required to eliminate the hazards in the permit space, the entry
           must be made with an entry permit. Once the hazards have been eliminated, the space may be
           reclassified as non-permit as long as the hazards remain eliminated.
           7.4.1.2. The actual or potential atmospheric hazards are eliminated, and continuous monitor-
           ing is used to ensure that the atmosphere remains free of hazards.
           7.4.1.3. That all hazards within the space are eliminated without entering the space at the time
           of testing, and any non-atmospheric hazards remain eliminated.
           7.4.1.4. That during routine work, the entrant does not take tools or introduce material into the
           space that could themselves cause a hazard.
           7.4.1.5. The entrant does not perform any work that would cause a hazardous condition.
           7.4.1.6. The entry permit is revoked whenever any test, monitoring instrument, or observation
           shows hazardous conditions are developing in the confined space more hazardous than
           allowed under the permit. When this occurs, the entry supervisor will secure the area and pre-
           vent entry until an approved entry permit is issued.
           7.4.1.7. The entry supervisor documents the basis for the reclassification on a separate sheet,
           attaches it to the entry permit and signs or initials next to the statement.
           7.4.1.8. These confined spaces are not considered hazardous and have no reasonable probabil-
           ities to become hazardous.
           7.4.1.9. These spaces are defined as confined because of design, may have limited openings
           for entry and exit, and may have limited space (lateral fuel pits under 5 feet deep, dikes less
911AWI91-301 6 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                           15


         than 6 feet in height around fuel storage tanks areas defined as non-permit required in aircraft
         T.O. est.).
         7.4.1.10. Entry into a non-permit required confined space does not require a permit unless
         conditions within or around the space have changed since classification (example: fuel that has
         settled in diking around bulk storage). At that time the entry supervisor, SEG, CEF, and SGPB
         personnel will reevaluate the confined space to determine if a permit is required.
         7.4.1.11. Hazards such as slippery surfaces, or deteriorated pipe ladders may make self-rescue
         difficult for the entrant.
         7.4.1.12. Also, fuel pits less than 5 feet deep with jet fuel accumulation due to line leak may
         present a hazard to repair crews. In cases where no entry permit is required, it may be appro-
         priate for entrants to use a body harness to facilitate rescue operations in case of problems, for
         an attendant to be assigned to monitor the entry process, or other special procedures developed
         to protect entrants.
         7.4.1.13. Non-permit required confined spaces shall be reviewed, at least annually, to ensure
         that conditions have not changed which could result in a potential for hazards and a change in
         confined space classification.
         7.4.1.14. A non-permit required confined space will be reevaluated any time a known change
         in mission occurs or new construction is planned which may affect the space or the area imme-
         diately adjacent to the space.
  7.5. Ventilation:
     7.5.1. When initial testing indicates ventilation is required to remove detected contaminants and
     (or) provide adequate oxygen levels, the entry supervisor will ensure ventilation is provided dur-
     ing entry and occupancy of the space.
     7.5.2. NEVER use pure oxygen to ventilate a confined space.
     7.5.3. Ventilate with ambient air.
  7.6. PPE/Equipment:
     7.6.1. The entry supervisor will:
         7.6.1.1. Contact the local SGPB staff for assistance in selecting the appropriate respiratory
         protective equipment and other PPE as determined necessary to protect the entrant.
         7.6.1.2. Ensure only explosion proof or intrinsically safe equipment is used where flammable
         or explosive atmospheres are present.
         7.6.1.3. Ensure personnel entering a permit-required confined space are suited with a harness
         and lifeline of a type suitable to permit extraction of the person (does not become a hindrance
         to the extraction) from the space.
         7.6.1.4. Ensure the lifeline is securely attached to the harness and adequate attachment points
         outside the confined space are available and used. When the space is so configured that the
         use of a lifeline would present additional hazards, a harness and lifeline will not be used.
     7.6.2. Provide personnel within the space with NIOSH-approved respiratory protective equip-
     ment suitable for the exposure, where toxic materials are or may be introduced into the space.
16                                                                 911AWI91-301 6 SEPTEMBER 2006


        7.6.3. Any atmosphere with less than 19.5% oxygen should not be entered without self-contained
        breathing apparatus (SCBA).
     7.7. Communications:
        7.7.1. The entrants and attendant outside the space will establish and maintain communications.
        7.7.2. If it is not possible for one attendant to maintain communications with each entrant because
        of the entrant’s work station in the space, the supervisor will make other arrangements to ensure
        the attendant is continuously aware of the location and condition of any entrant who is out of
        direct communication range.
     7.8. Master Entry Plan (MEP):
        7.8.1. A Master Entry Plan shall be developed when requested by the functional manager or com-
        mander.
        7.8.2. The MEP, a part of the overall written confined space program, will serve as approval for
        recurring entries having the same conditions and entry requirements when signed by representa-
        tives of Ground Safety (SEG), Fire Protection (CEF), and Bioenvironmental Engineering (SGPB).
        The MEP allows functional managers and commanders to designate entry supervisors to issue
        entry permits.
        7.8.3. Using the MEP as a guide, the entry supervisor will prepare an entry permit.
        7.8.4. Permits, issued by an entry supervisor under MEP, will permit entry into a specific con-
        fined space, for a specific purpose, by a specific work crew, for a period not to exceed a single
        shift or as determined jointly by the CSPT. All applicable areas of the permit must be filled out
        correctly and completely. NOTE: Rescue entry is exempted from this requirement.
        7.8.5. For routinely recurring work in permit-required confined spaces (i.e., sewers, lateral fuel
        pits, dikes, aircraft spaces,) where the space may be entered on a regular basis, a MEP may be
        developed and approved by SEG, CEF, and SGPB personnel.
        7.8.6. Permits will not be issued when unexpected conditions exist that have not been anticipated
        or allowed for in the MEP, unless the condition can be eliminated or controlled. If hazardous con-
        ditions develop after entry that cannot be eliminated or controlled, the entry will be terminated, the
        permit revoked and retained for 1 year, and SEG, CEF, and SGPB will be contacted before pro-
        ceeding.
        7.8.7. All Master entry plans shall be reviewed by SEG, CEF, and SGPB and the organizational
        representative at least annually, to ensure conditions have not changed.
        7.8.8. The MEP will:
           7.8.8.1. Describe the acceptable entry conditions, including acceptable atmospheric condi-
           tions, under which permits may be issued.
           7.8.8.2. Designate as many entry supervisors as needed for the organization.
           Identify the types and locations of spaces to be entered, and the types of tasks or operations to
           be performed.

         7.8.8.22. Will, when possible, periodically monitor permit-required space entry operations.

8. Emergency and Rescue Procdeures:
   8.1. General:
      8.1.1. The MEP will include emergency and rescue procedures consistent with the nature of each
      known operation which requires entry into a permit-required confined space.
      8.1.2. The entry supervisor will coordinate with the installation CEF, SEG, and SGPB when
      required to enter non-routine permit-required confined spaces not included in the MEP and estab-
      lish emergency rescue procedures prior to entry.

     and the Organizational Rescue Team.
        8.2.1. Self-Rescue - Employees are trained to exit from the confined space when required.
        8.2.2. “ACAAFD Rescue Team”:
           8.2.2.1. The ACAAFD will provide rescue services for personnel working in confined spaces
           on 911 AW. The entry supervisor will contact ACAAFD prior to entering a PER-
           MIT-REQUIRED confined space, to coordinate rescue assistance and ensure its availability
           within a reasonable period of time.
           8.2.2.2. When deemed appropriate by the fire chief, the rescue team should stand by at the
           scene.
        8.2.3. Organization Rescue Team:
           8.2.3.1. When a confined space entry is to be performed in an area in which the ACAAFD
           cannot provide rescue assistance, the entry supervisor will ensure an organizational rescue
           team is available prior to entering the confined space.
           8.2.3.2. An organizational rescue team will consist of trained personnel equipped with the
           PPE necessary for entry into confined spaces and with rescue and retrieval equipment suitable
           for the type of confined spaces involved.

           by the permit system.
           8.2.3.5. Providing an equivalent method for rescue when retrieval lines may constitute an
           entanglement hazard or otherwise cannot be used.
           8.2.3.6. Determining the availability of a rescue team. Verify the availability of an organiza-
           tional rescue team or other emergency rescue team. The operation will be halted if for some
           reason the primary rescue team becomes unavailable.
           8.2.3.7. Ensuring the means (i.e., telephone, radio, etc.) for summoning the rescue team are
           operable, on hand or easily accessible.
