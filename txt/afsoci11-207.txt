                                              Chapter 1

                                        GENERAL POLICY

1.1. General. HQ AFSOC is designated as lead command for developing, documenting, and
disseminating tactics for Air Force Special Operation Forces (AFSOF), AFSOC-gained Air
National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Component (AFRC) forces. This instruction
describes the AFSOC tactics program to fulfill this responsibility.
1.2. Tactics Program Goal and Objectives. The goal of the tactics program is to support unit
commanders in their responsibility to provide combat-ready aircrews and tactical ground
personnel to the combatant commander. This instruction provides a framework for the AFSOC
tactics program. Succinctly stated, a unit tactics program should focus significant effort on
instructing unit personnel on proper planning, employment, and assessment of published tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTP), and equipment. In those situations where published TTP and
equipment are lacking, it is the responsibility of the unit tactician to identify how tactical realities
have changed, what the proposed solutions are, and then to share that information both vertically
and laterally. A properly administered tactics program will:
    1.2.1. Ensure unit training supports combat employment tasks.
    1.2.2. Provide a reliable source for planning, employment decision-making, and a realistic
    assessment of combat capability at all levels.
    1.2.3. Validate existing tactics.
    1.2.4. Provide for active participation in the development of TTP.
    1.2.5. Manage and disseminate cross flow of relevant tactics information among AFSOC
    units and appropriate outside organizations.
    1.2.6. Serve as the operations focal point for weapons and munitions issues.
    1.2.7. Serve as the focal point for external tactical training support.
    1.2.8. Ensure program development, implementation, and sustainment.
1.3. Commander Responsibilities. Commanders will ensure:
    1.3.1. Ensure all AFSOC-assigned and AFSOC-gained personnel take an active role in the
    development of peacetime, contingency, and wartime tactics.
    1.3.2. Tactics offices and functions are staffed with trained and experienced personnel, in
    accordance with (IAW) Chapter 3 of this instruction.
    1.3.3. Tactics offices are provided adequate resources to comply with the requirements of
    this instruction.
1.4. Recommendations for Change. Recommendations for improvement to this instruction are
highly encouraged. Submit change recommendations to HQ AFSOC/A3VT using AF Form 847.
1.5. Supplements. Each wing/group may supplement this instruction as necessary but may not
be less restrictive. Forward a copy of the draft supplement to HQ AFSOC/A3VT for final
review prior to implementation.

1.6. Waivers. Waivers should be in letter format and contain: Paragraph number and name
defining requirement; reason for inability to comply with requirement; if waiver is a renewal to a
previous waiver, explain why another waiver is required; description of the plan to achieve
compliance; and approximate date of expected compliance (see Attachment 2 for format).
HQ AFSOC/A3VT is the point of contact for tracking and notification within the command.
Approved waiver requests will be returned, through channels, to the requesting unit. Waivers
will remain valid until the expected compliance date or one year from their approval date,
whichever occurs first. Unit tacticians will review waivers quarterly to assess progress toward
compliance with this instruction.
     1.6.1. Waiver Approval Process. HQ AFSOC/A3 is the approval authority for all waivers to
     this instruction for all AFSOC active duty, ANG, and AFRC units. Waivers must be
     reviewed and approved through each level in operations channels. HQ AFSOC will notify
     HQ NGB/A3 and/or HQ AFRC/A3 of waiver status disposition for ANG or AFRC units.
     Waiver requests for administrative or manning issues originating from ANG and AFRC units
     will be staffed through HQ NGB/A3 or HQ AFRC/A3 with information copies sent to HQ
     AFSOC/A3. All other waiver requests originating from ANG and AFRC units must be
     staffed through the HQ NGB/A3 or HQ AFRC/A3 prior to final approval/disapproval by HQ
     AFSOC/A3.

                                           Chapter 2

                         HEADQUARTERS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. General. In order to fulfill the USSOCOM-directed tasks and meet any other tasking as
directed by the Secretary of Defense, AFSOC forces are organized, trained, and equipped to
support the ten core missions defined in AFDD 3-05, Special Operations. A detailed discussion
of these core area missions is not necessary here; what is required is the understanding that
tactics programs are central toward effective support of the ten core missions. The following
paragraphs prescribe responsibilities to headquarter organizations as they pertain to supporting
effective tactics programs.
2.2. HQ AFSOC/A3:
   2.2.1. As the AFSOC Director of Operations, the A3 is primarily responsible for the
   direction and control of forces. Consequently, it is the A3’s responsibility to ensure the
   command’s operators are capable of accomplishing their assigned mission from a ―home
   station‖ perspective. When forces must be deployed to or redeployed from overseas
   contingency operations (OCO), the A3 transitions into the Numbered Air Force (NAF)/CC
   role. As OCO operations are ongoing, this back and forth shift occurs constantly. The
   transition between the A3 and NAF/CC roles is therefore important to ―feed the fight‖ with
   mission-ready forces and equipment. This document focuses largely on the A3’s role in
   preparing those forces and only briefly touches on the role of 23 AF and the 623 AOC to
   present those assets to the fight.
       2.2.1.1. Approves the AFSOC Tactics Program outlined in this instruction.
       2.2.1.2. Validates tactical requirements and recommends actions to correct identified
       deficiencies in tactical employment capability.
       2.2.1.3. Appoints the Special Operations Forces Tactics Analysis Team (SOFTAT)
       operations co-chair. This co-chair will coordinate conferences, reports, and other key
       procedures with the intelligence co-chair. The operations co-chair will work with the
       intelligence co-chair, and the Special Operations Forces Tactics and Adversaries Studies
       Element (SOFTASE) to ensure all AFSOC units receive the latest SOFTAT products.
       Information on SOFTAT and the duties of the SOFTASE can be found at
       http://afsofnet.afsoc.af.smil.mil/sites/a2/a2o/A2OA/default.aspx.
   2.2.2. HQ AFSOC/A3V:
       2.2.2.1. HQ AFSOC/A3VT is the focal point for weapons and tactics program policy and
       guidance and the office of primary responsibility (OPR) and program manager for the
       AFSOC tactics program and this instruction. HQ AFSOC/A3VT responsibilities include:
       2.2.2.2. Review current threat assessments and recommended tactics applications and
       changes.
       2.2.2.3. Evaluate current employment tactics, mission planning routines, and analysis of
       current and emerging threats with applicable agencies.
       2.2.2.4. Identify evolving technologies with tactical application.

      2.2.2.5. Provide tactical expertise and advice to exercise and mission planners.
      2.2.2.6. Review, coordinate, and manage Tactics Working Group (TWG) requirements.
      2.2.2.7. Support field unit tactical requirements.
      2.2.2.8. Define tactics requirements.
      2.2.2.9. Provide guidance and oversight for the tactics aircrew testing program.

                         FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Tactics Programs General.
   3.1.1. Tactics Organization Purpose. The purpose of tactics offices at all echelons is to
   ensure aircrew members and tactical ground personnel are well-versed in Tactics Techniques
   and Procedures (TTP) relating to their mission area and have a thorough understanding of the
   best tactics to employ in a given tactical scenario; deficiencies with aircraft or tactical
   hardware or software are properly identified; tactics are safely developed and functionally-
   defined by mission; and information and tactics are exchanged among common mission
   areas. Squadrons and groups unable to meet the requirements of this paragraph must submit
   justification and a request for waiver IAW Paragraph 1.6. AFRC/A3, NGB/A3, wings, and
   groups may supplement this regulation to identify specific responsibilities for their tactics
   functions. Send supplements to AFSOC/A3VT for final review prior to publication.
   3.1.2. Weapons Officers. Refer to AFI 11-415, Weapons and Tactics Program, for guidance
   on Weapons Officer selection, management, and leadership responsibilities.
   3.1.3. Tactician Qualifications. AFSOC's wartime role and preparedness will suffer unless
   commanders give priority consideration to filling the positions as described below.
      3.1.3.1. Select the most highly qualified people based upon capability, planning ability,
      instructional ability, and tactical experience. Squadron tacticians will ideally be
      instructors; if manning constraints preclude assigning instructors as tacticians, select
      competent individuals to serve in the shop until more qualified individuals can be
      appointed. A unit commander must gauge the individual’s ability to accomplish tactics
      office duties based on formal training, experience, maturity, and energy.
      3.1.3.2. Group and squadron aircrew tacticians are required to be current and remain
      fully mission qualified to the greatest extent possible.
      3.1.3.3. Complete AFSOC TMT within 30 days of being assigned to a tactics office
      (N/A to USAFWS graduates). TMT should be instructed by a weapons officer, or by the
      chief of Ops Group/OSS weapons and tactics if a suitable weapons officer is not available
      on station. If neither the group chief of tactics or an USAFWS graduate is available,
      TMT may be instructed by any individual who has previously received the training,
      preferably a group tactician. Classes should have at least four new tacticians,
      representing as diverse an MDS background from within the group as possible, to allow
      for cross flow of lesson discussion. It is recommended that classes be held at least
      semiannually.
      3.1.3.4. Space officers must be familiar with AFSOC mission employment. They should
      attend the United States Air Force Special Operations School’s Introduction to Special
      Operations Course as soon as practical after assignment to group tactics.
      3.1.3.5. When possible, tacticians should have a TS clearance to afford access to
      operationally-relevant material at elevated classification levels and to maintain awareness
      of information vital for effective mission planning and tactical employment.
 14                                                               AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012


3.2. Group Weapons and Tactics. The overall function of Operations Group/OSS Weapons
and Tactics is to facilitate the tactics training and improvement efforts of the operational
squadrons and serve as a focal point to the OG/CC for the tactical employment of his combat
resources. To meet this requirement, the group tactics office will comply with the following:
   3.2.1. Ensure office manning meets or exceeds the desired/minimum quotas outlined in
   Table 3.1 for all group-assigned MDS/Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Priority should be
   given to filling line unit tactics offices first.
Note: These manned requirements are not manpower requirements. Manpower requirements
are identified via manpower standard application.
        3.2.1.1. Ensure personnel assigned to the Operations Group/OSS Weapons and Tactics
        office have at least 6 months experience in a squadron tactics shop before being assigned
        as a group tactician.
        3.2.1.2. Ensure all group tacticians maintain Mission Ready/Combat Mission Ready
        (MR/CMR) status.
        3.2.1.3. The chief of Operations Group/OSS weapons and tactics should be a USAFWS
        graduate (not applicable if the Group has no USAFWS graduates or if all graduates have
        fulfilled their Tier 2 commitment IAW AFI 11-415).

NOTES:
  1) Quotas listed (for both crew positions and number of people) may and should be exceeded as
     available manning allows.
  2) At least one (1) USAFWS graduate must be assigned to OGK, regardless of airframe.
  3) At least one (1) electronic warfare officer must be assigned to OGK, regardless of airframe.
  4) ANG/AFRC tactician slots may be filled by either traditional or full-time Guardsmen/Reservists
     and will be assigned to the Tactics office as their primary duty position.
  5) Additional MC-130 crew member only required at overseas groups.
  6) Group-level ST manning quotas refer to 720 STG; ST manning is not required at operations
     group tactics offices
  7) TSO requirement only applicable to units with TSOs assigned, and authorized by parent chain
     of command.
  3.2.2. Tactical Employment/Threat Open Book Test. Group tactics offices are responsible
  for developing and implementing testing procedures for tactical employment open book
  exams. All aircrew members will satisfactorily complete a 40 question test at least once
  every 17 months (ARMS Task ID: G063). Tactical employment/threat open book exams
  may be aligned with an aircrew members’ periodic flight evaluation, however there is no
  need to do so. Test questions will be taken from the secure question bank and be relevant to
  the member’s crew position (see paragraph 3.2.2.3 for additional information regarding
  secure question banks). Minimum passing score is 85 percent.
      3.2.2.1. Test Administration. The group tactics office retains overall responsibility for
      tactics testing, but may delegate responsibility for tactics test creation and administration
      to squadron tactics shops. If a crew member fails the test, notify the crew member's
      operations officer who will direct additional training prior to a retest. Retest versions will
      include no more than 70 percent of the questions included in the initial test.
      3.2.2.2. Test Failure and Re-examination. All retests will be accomplished no sooner
      than 24 hours after the failed test to afford adequate time to review applicable
      publications and accomplish directed training; additional disciplinary action will be at the
      discretion of the flying squadron operations officer/commander. The aircrew member
      will be re-evaluated using an alternate exam IAW paragraph 3.2.2.1.
      3.2.2.3. Secure Question Banks (SQB). Secure question banks will be maintained and
      updated at the test administration site (e.g., squadron tactics office, if delegated by the
      group). The group tactics offices are responsible for ensuring secure question banks for
      each MDS within the group are updated and maintained. Individual tests are to be
      relevant to the member’s crew position; thus, question banks must be expansive enough
      to support primary and alternate test versions for each crew position of a given MDS.
      Derive questions from the following publications: AFTTP 3-1.General Planning and
      Employment Considerations, AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide, the respective AFTTP 3-1(MDS)
      volume, pertinent defensive system handbooks, squadron CONOPS (if any), and
      classified aircraft technical orders (if applicable). A common SQB may be used by all
16                                                        AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012


     units that share a given AFTTP publication, provided the question bank is reviewed by
     each group at least annually. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and safeguard it
     in the same manner as any other required, controlled examination.
         3.2.2.3.1. Change a minimum of 30 percent of the questions on examinations each
         calendar year. Once removed from the SQB, previous questions may be reused after
         a 1-year absence as long as they remain consistent with current publications/tactics.
         3.2.2.3.2. Examination Question Review. Squadron and group tacticians will review
         each SQB at least annually. Due to AFFTP rewrites, changes to CONOPS, and/or
         other significant operational changes, tactics tests may require out-of-cycle reviews.

3.3. Squadron Weapons and Tactics.
   3.3.1. Manning. The weapons and tactics offices of operational flying squadrons are the
   heart and soul of the AFSOC Tactics Program. As such, unit commanders should place
   emphasis on manning these offices with highly competent, experienced individuals.
   Instructors are preferred; however, if manning constraints dictate, motivated, respected
   individuals may be assigned as squadron tacticians. Ensure tacticians are properly trained
   and resourced to effectively implement squadron tactics program initiatives and achieve
   desired goals. In addition to meeting or exceeding the desired and minimum manning quotas
   listed in Table 3.2, squadron tactics office manning will comply with the following:
Note: These manned requirements are not manpower requirements. Manpower requirements in
flying operations squadrons are earned by Air Force manpower standards (overhead) and crew
ratio (flight crew).
       3.3.1.1. The chief of squadron weapons and tactics should be a USAFWS graduate
       unless the squadron has no USAFWS graduates or if all graduates have fulfilled their Tier
       1 and 2 commitments IAW AFI 11-415.
       3.3.1.2. Squadron tacticians must possess exemplary tactical knowledge and expertise
       and be capable of instructing crew members in sound tactical employment, proper use of
       defensive systems and threat countertactics, means of integrating with other air assets,
       and support of users.

        TACTICS DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (TDIP)

4.1. General. AFSOC's Tactics Development and Improvement Program (TDIP) develops,
documents, and disseminates tactics to increase AFSOC's combat capability. The TDIP provides
two means to improve command tactics: Tactics Improvement Proposals (TIP) and submissions
of Tactics After Action Reports (TAAR). The TIP is used to identify tactics deficiencies and
develop new or improved tactics. AFI 11-260, Tactics Development Program, describes the TIP
and Tactics Review Board (TRB) processes used by AFSOF, to include associated Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve Command units. The TAAR is used to provide relevant tactics
information for dissemination throughout the AFSOF. Paragraph 4.5 and Attachment 3 provide
additional guidance concerning TAARs.
   4.1.1. Active unit commander participation and support is the cornerstone of a successful
   tactics improvement program.
   4.1.2. Tactics development is a process that starts early in the weapon system’s acquisition
   cycle and continues through weapon system retirement. The TDIP ensures that lessons
   learned are captured, disseminated, and promulgated for future generations. Additional
   AFSOC TDIP associated processes and programs are identified in Attachment 5.
4.2. Tactics Improvement Proposal (AF IMT 4326).
   4.2.1. Use AF Form 4326 IAW AFI 11-260 to address a tactical deficiency or to address new
   or previously undocumented tactics found to be effective.
   4.2.2. TIPs should be used to suggest improvements to current tactics, not as means to
   accomplish the following: propose aircraft modifications, acquire hardware or software, or
   propose training changes. Attachment 5 outlines the processes to accomplish hardware,
   software, and training changes and modifications.
   4.2.3. If the TIP is of immediate concern and will affect current operations or testing, the
   TIP should follow the established routing but at an accelerated pace. This accelerated
   routing cannot be readily defined and will be dictated by the circumstances requiring tactics
   development, but each level of authority should be notified concurrent with headquarters
   routing.
   4.2.4. TIPs should be staffed through local channels and submitted using the TIP
   Application      on      the     HQ     AFSOC      SOFnet     SharePoint     Portal    at
   http://afsofnet.afsoc.af.smil.mil/default.aspx. From the main SOFnet portal page, expand
   the Application list and select ―TIPS.‖
       4.2.4.1. TIPs submitted by ANG/AFRC units should, after group level approval, be
       submitted to appropriate ANG/AFRC tactics agencies in addition to AFSOC HQ/A3VT.
4.3. Tactics Review Board (TRB). AFSOF, to include associated ANG/AFRC units, will use
the guidelines contained in AFI 11-260 to conduct TRBs.
   4.3.1. Squadron weapons and tactics offices will convene a TRB NLT 15 September each
   year. Forward results to the operations group weapons and tactics office.
AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                      25


   4.3.2. Group weapons and tactics offices will convene a TRB NLT 1 October each year.
   Forward results to HQ AFSOC/A3VT in advance of the annual tactics conference.
4.4. Lessons Learned. Lessons Learned (L2) submitted into the Joint Lessons Learned
Information System (JLLIS, located at http://www.jllis.smil.mil/ussocom) serve as action items
for the HQ AFSOC staff to address. Each month, representatives from every headquarters
directorate convene a Lessons Learned Working Group (LLWG). The LLWG reviews,
prioritizes, and assigns OPRs to action each L2. Tacticians should work closely with unit
leadership and the USSOCOM L2 personnel at their group to staff submissions that warrant
MAJCOM-level attention and prompt action, especially those with Command-wide impact.
4.5. Tactics After Action Reports (TAAR).
   4.5.1. The TAAR supports the warfighter by providing timely, tactically-significant
   information to the AFSOC tactics database for command-wide dissemination. TAARs are
   used to share significant tactics/lessons learned for cross-tell purposes. TAARs can benefit
   units of the same or similar MDS or be of command-wide interest. Units should use TAARs
   on a routine basis to report relevant tactical information resulting from: exercises (e.g., ORIs,
   joint exercises, flag exercises, and AATTC), contingency operations, tactics intra-fly sorties,
   combat mission training sorties, TD&E missions, and other events involving tactical
   operations. TAARs should be submitted as soon as possible following event completion
   using the format in Attachment 3 (which is aligned with the USSOCOM format).
   4.5.2. HQ AFSOC/A3VT coordinates with the appropriate HQ AFSOC offices to identify
   TD&E requirements and/or information for dissemination and provides feedback to the
   originator. TAARs do not replace TIPs as a means of proposing tactics improvements. If a
   potential tactics improvement is identified, the TAAR originator may be notified and
   requested to submit a TIP for the next TRB.
       4.5.2.1. Squadron level weapons and tactics offices are the key to success. Each
       squadron weapons and tactics office should continually coordinate with mission crews,
       maintenance and support personnel, and supported units to identify potential tactics
       impacts.
       4.5.2.2. When appropriate, a TAAR may be included as part of an event's after action
       report (e.g. mission commander’s report) and does not need to be sent under separate
       cover. In this case, ensure that HQ AFSOC/A3VT is a recipient of the after action report.
   4.5.3. Some TAARs may require expedited AFSOC attention. These TAARs should be
   identified with ///IMMEDIATE/// at the top of the TAAR submission. The immediacy of
   information dissemination is the driving factor of whether to submit a TAAR marked
   ///IMMEDIATE///. They are used to rapidly disseminate tactically significant information to
   the warfighter and report significant tactics information that is of immediate concern. A
   TAAR of this nature can be submitted from any organizational level. HQ AFSOC/A3VT
   will review all TAARs and recommend the appropriate action to AFSOC/A3. If wider
   dissemination is required, a flash bulletin can be published through the 561st Joint Tactics
   Squadron.
       4.5.3.1. An Immediate TAAR (marked ―I-TAAR‖) does not replace or alter established
       post-mission reports or procedures. An I-TAAR may provide amplifying information on
       an event identified in a post mission report, which can itself be used as a supporting
26                                                      AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012


     document for the I-TAAR. An I-TAAR is provided for information purposes only and
     does not authorize deviations from established TTP, flight manuals, or other published
     guidance.
     4.5.3.2. The mission commander, with the recommendation of deployed tacticians,
     determines whether or not an event meets the I-TAAR criteria (identified in 9.6.4.1 and
     Attachment 3, paragraph A3.2) and is responsible for reporting the information
     accordingly. Extensive review and coordination must be avoided to prevent the delay of
     disseminating critical employment information.
     4.5.3.3. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the I-TAAR, this report is less formal than
     the TAAR and should answer basic questions IAW the format provided in Attachment 3.
     I-TAARs are posted on the AFSOC Tactics Information Management System website.

                                    TACTICS TRAINING

5.1. General. Squadron tacticians are responsible for ensuring all aircrew members possess
strong tactical knowledge for the sound employment of their MDS. Additionally, they are
responsible for planning and coordinating tactical employment training for aircrew members.
Currency requirements for CMT, VPE, and CMS are the primary methods of receiving combat
training defined in AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1, and this chapter. VPEs may be dual-logged as
CMT if all of the following are fulfilled: the applicable items listed in AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1
are covered; the mission is flown in a weapon system trainer or aircraft; and all items in
Paragraph 5.3. are accomplished.
5.2. Ground-based Training. The training items described below are intended to provide the
knowledge required for aircrews to prepare for and execute their unit’s missions. Mandatory in-
unit tactics training consists of:
   5.2.1. Threat System Recognition Training. Conduct IAW AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1.
   Review relevant threat systems using any means available including weapon system training
   devices, and HQ AFSOC-approved training software (e.g. Threat Signal Recognition
   Training System (TSRTS), Global Air Tactics Employment Review (GATER) II/III and/or
   Real World Air Combat Environment (RW ACE)) (N/A for units with aircraft without
   defensive systems).
   5.2.2. Combat Mission Training (CMT). CMT programs require the active involvement and
   support of unit commanders, operations officers, tactics officers, intelligence officers, and all
   aircrew members. CMT is required as initial and recurring training.
Note: For 6 SOS, both initial and recurring CMT specific to Combat Aviation Advisory is
conducted via the supervised predeployment program.
       5.2.2.1. Initial CMT is an academic training requirement and provides crew members
       with the academic knowledge required to plan and execute missions in various hostile
       environments. This training provides the groundwork for conducting the follow-on VPEs
       and CMSs. Initial CMT may be accomplished at the formal school in conjunction with a
       mission qualification course or as part of a local mission qualification course. As a
       minimum, initial CMT will cover the required topics defined in Table 5.1.
       5.2.2.2. Recurring CMT is a refresher for the knowledge taught in initial CMT.
       Recurring CMT will be provided at annual in-unit refresher training or block training. It
       must contain unit mission, Area of Operations (AO) and theater-specific threat
       information, command and control structures, general threats and weapon system-specific
       countertactics/evasive maneuvers. The material should focus heavily on areas not
       routinely exercised. USAFWS graduates, unit intelligence, or tacticians will instruct
       CMT refresher. Unit tactics and training personnel will determine training requirements
       based on unit and theater-specific mission requirements, DOC statements, JMETLs, and
       items contained in Table 5.1.
       5.2.2.3. All topics in Table 5.1. are not necessary to complete refresher CMT. USAFWS
       instructors may log recurring CMT while teaching USAFWS classes.

       5.2.2.4. Accreditation. Completion of initial/refresher CMT is documented in the
       Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS).
   5.2.3. Aircrew Intelligence Training. Unit tacticians will coordinate for intelligence
   personnel to provide initial CMT and CMT refresher for aircrew members in threats,
   intelligence-related areas, and country study briefings. Unit tacticians must coordinate with
   the intelligence office to support this training requirement.
Note: Intelligence personnel assigned to the 6 SOS will provide threat, intelligence, and country
study briefings to all teams deploying. Intelligence briefings include, but are not limited to, host
nation AOB, tactical threats, force protection issues, and cultural information. These briefings
meet the criteria for the annual intelligence briefing and are tailored to individual operations and
geographic areas.

   5.2.4. Quarterly Tactics Training. Squadron tacticians will provide, or coordinate with
   appropriate organizations to develop and support, quarterly tactics briefings on subjects
   important to the squadron’s mission, tactics, and tactical employment. Chiefs of unit tactics
   are encouraged to use this opportunity to administer at least a ten question tactics-related test
   to assess and elevate the level of tactics knowledge among unit aircrew members. These
   tests may focus on the material presented during tactics lectures. Break-out tactics
   discussions by crew position are also encouraged.
5.3. Verification Planning Exercises (VPE). VPEs provide the opportunity for aircrews to
apply their combat knowledge and skills in a training environment. VPEs reinforce knowledge
gained during in-unit academic training, CMS, aircrew intelligence training, mission
qualification open/closed book examinations, and refresh crews with real-world mission
planning procedures. VPEs also provide crews the opportunity to exercise local mission
planning support processes such as intelligence, weather, rules of engagement, and legal (judge
advocate) mission considerations. VPEs should be conducted in conjunction with the unit initial
assessment (IA) in support of their OPLAN/CONPLAN or rotational tasking. Participation in
the planning and Verification Review Board (VRB) briefing of an operational, contingency, or
exercise mission may be substituted for a VPE. Unit commanders will determine which
missions qualify to satisfy this requirement. Wing/group plans will provide access to unit
OPLAN/CONPLAN taskings for group and squadron tacticians review.
Note: For 6 SOS, the preparation for an OAD deployment meets the VPE requirements of this
section.
   5.3.1. Specific training events that must be accomplished by each MDS are contained within
   their respective AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 1. In the absence of specific Volume 1 guidance, see
   Attachment 6, Verification Planning Exercise Planning Elements, for essential elements for
   the accomplishment of VPEs.
AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                     31


   5.3.2. VPE crews should construct a Special Operations Mission Planning Folder (SOMPF)
   IAW Attachment 4 and JP 3-05.1.
   5.3.3. Verification Review Board (VRB). The VRB serves as a ―dry run‖ briefing. The
   board should consist of the squadron commander, squadron operations officer, and chiefs of
   tactics and standardization/evaluation. Additional board members will be designated by the
   Sq/CC with inputs from the squadron tactics office. The purpose of the board is to provide
   unit leadership with an opportunity to review the plan and make a determination of its current
   validity.
5.4. Combat Mission Sortie (CMS).
   5.4.1. Challenge aircrew members with essential tactical mission sets required to execute the
   unit’s mission and serve as a tool for unit leadership to evaluate tactics training within their
   unit. CMSs should provide the opportunity to practice/simulate all requirements associated
   with planning, flying, and debriefing a combat mission within a given theater’s AOR. Plan
   and execute the CMS in the same sequence, using the same planning and briefing formats as
   a combat or contingency mission. A tactics observer should be on board in order to log a
   CMS. The tactics observer will complete a TAAR any time they observe events worthy of
   crosstell to other units/aircraft. Squadron tactics shops will maintain these reports for a
   minimum of 2 years and forward a copy to HQ AFSOC/A3VT. If a tactics observer is not
   available, an experienced crewmember may be assigned this responsibility at the discretion
   of the unit operations officer/commander.
   5.4.2. Newly qualified crew members should acquire exposure to unit and theater-specific
   procedures and complete a CMS within 90 days of their first flight in their new unit and/or
   prior to deploying for real-world contingencies.
Note: 6 SOS will use their Integrated Skills Training (IST) to meet the preceding CMS
requirement.
   5.4.3. Every attempt should be made to prevent changes to CMS crew composition from the
   beginning of mission planning to the conclusion of the debriefing.
   5.4.4. Every attempt should be made to make all mission crew members available the day
   prior to complete all required mission planning, allowing normal show times the day of
   execution.
   5.4.5. In addition to local flying training profiles, a CMS may be logged, at unit
   commander’s discretion, following flying operations as part of a real-world mission,
   contingency operation, or any mission in an actual threat environment. Additionally, at unit
   commander’s discretion, flying participation in courses and exercises that enhance learning,
   tactical employment, and joint or combined operations may credit a CMS. Attachment 7
   contains a CMS observation checklist that may be used as a starting point for unit tacticians
   to observe aircrew tactics, identify deficiencies, and initiate improvements.
   5.4.6. Group and squadron tacticians should fly with aircrews to assess the unit’s skill in a
   tactical, unit-developed scenario. Any significant observations, trend items, or techniques
   that warrant squadron-level assessment will be brought to the attention of squadron and/or
   group tactics offices. These missions require close coordination between tacticians and the
   unit scheduling section.
 32                                                          AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012


5.5. AFSOC Tactics Intra-fly Program (TIFP).
   5.5.1. Provides the opportunity for tacticians to observe operations while on aircraft from
   other AFSOC units, to exchange information and ideas, view missions and mission
   requirements from a different perspective, and assess their own unit’s capabilities and
   limitations based on their observations. In particular, tacticians will pursue opportunities to
   fly with other AFSOC units that have relationships of customer-provider and mission co-
   participant. Aircrew assigned to HQ AFSOC/A3VT may fly as a tactics observer on any
   AFSOC aircraft, primary assigned or other. Individuals participating in TIFP are responsible
   for providing the flying unit with all required flight eligibility documents IAW AFI 11-401,
   Flight Management, and will log ―other‖ flight time.
   5.5.2. Group tacticians should fly as observers on every aircraft MDS within their group
   each year. As a goal, each aircrew member assigned to group tactics should strive to
   accomplish an intra-fly sortie at least once each semiannual period and at least one intra-fly
   sortie should be flown on every MDS within the group. Maintain a record of Group Intra-fly
   participation for 2 years. Document noteworthy observations on a TAAR and submit to HQ
   AFSOC/A3VT.
       5.5.2.1. Squadron tacticians are encouraged to fly as observers on each aircraft MDS
       within their group annually, and should strive to fly aboard those aircraft whose missions
       relate to their own unit’s mission areas. Schedule these events on appropriate mission
       training flights, CMS missions, or during exercises. Document noteworthy observations
       on a TAAR and forward to HQ AFSOC/A3VT.
Note: 6 SOS aircrews are not included in this requirement, but are highly encouraged to
participate.
       5.5.2.2. For all observation flights, use appropriate portions of the CMS Observation
       checklist provided in Attachment 7.
       5.5.2.3. On invitation by unit commanders, 14 WPS instructors may fly as observers on
       unit aircraft to assist in the development of TTP when no USAFWS graduates are
       assigned to that unit. These personnel will not occupy a seat with flight controls unless
       they are current and qualified in that aircraft type or are accompanied by a qualified flight
       instructor in the other seat.
5.6. Off-Station Courses and Exercises. Group and squadron tacticians should promote unit
aircrew participation in courses and exercises that enhance tactical knowledge, emphasize sound
tactical employment, and joint/combined operations. These courses and exercises may meet
individual crew member VPE/CMS mission requirements. They include but are not limited to:
   5.6.1. Mission Employment phase of WIC, Nellis AFB NV.
   5.6.2. Formal flying exercises with an established threat scenario, such as SOFEX (14
   WPS), RED FLAG, JADED THUNDER, EMERALD WARRIOR, COPE THUNDER,
   FOAL EAGLE, COLD RESPONSE, etc.
   5.6.3. USSOCOM-sponsored Multi-Lateral training exercises.
   5.6.4. AATTC Course, St. Joseph MO.
   5.6.5. The semiannual Joint Capabilities (JCAP) conference hosted by the 561 JTS.

  5.6.6. Air Ground Operations School (AGOS) Joint Firepower Control Course, Nellis AFB
  NV.
  5.6.7. Combat Aircrew Tactics Studies and Mobility Electronic Combat Officer Course
  (CATS-MECOC)
  5.6.8. Other courses or exercises approved by the unit commander at the recommendation of
  unit tactics offices. Attachment 8 provides descriptions for recommended courses for
  AFSOC tacticians.

6.1. General. The tactics assessment program validates that the tactics program is effectively
meeting program goals and objectives and that program elements are being implemented.
Commanders and tacticians at all levels must ensure that the tactics assessment process
objectively addresses the tactics program and mission capability.
6.2. Tactics Process/Management Assessment. Tactics process/management assessment
provides a method to ensure the processes are being implemented properly and that the processes
meet the requirement. Tacticians must continuously assess the unit’s flight and ground training
programs as well as support equipment availability and suitability to meet tactics requirements.
Deficiencies identified as a result of these assessments must be resolved internally or forwarded
up tactics channels for assistance (e.g., training range deficiencies).
   6.2.1. Self-Inspection Checklist. Self-Inspection Checklists are available from the MICT
   website (https://www.my.af.mil/reservenetprod2/mic/mict/MyMICTView.aspx) and are
   developed to allow tacticians at each level to assess each element of their program against the
   requirements of this instruction. Tacticians are encouraged to supplement the provided
   checklists with additional steps related to local processes. Completion of the self-inspection
   checklists are required semiannually, but may be conducted more frequently at unit
   discretion. Tactics offices should maintain copies of completed checklists for one year after
   the completion of the next comparable inspection IAW AFRIMS Table 33-46 Rule 31. HQ
   AFSOC/A3VT personnel will use selected checklist items when conducting assistance and
   assessment visits.
   6.2.2. Staff Assistance Visits. SAVs are intended to provide assistance to units when
   requested and in advance of formal assessments. SAVs provide an informal (nonattribution)
   view of the strengths, weaknesses, and overall health of the unit tactics program, providing a
   starting point for any necessary improvements. Squadrons and groups should request SAVs
   to address specific requirements, (e.g., solving a problem, preparing for a formal visit, or
   provide periodic program review and inputs). Units should request SAVs through their chain
   of command with sufficient lead-time to accommodate planning, scheduling, and unit
   requirements.
   6.2.3. HQ AFSOC Combined Unit Inspections (CUI). HQ AFSOC/A3VT will inspect
   group and squadron tactics programs as part of CUIs led by the AFSOC Inspector General.
   These inspections will focus on process management, compliance with the requirements and
   intent of this instruction, and assessing whether the tactics programs enhance the combat
   readiness and capability of their unit.
6.3. Capabilities/Mission Assessment. Tacticians must ensure that tactics and tactical
employment capabilities meet unit mission requirements. The unit tactician can use combat and
contingencies, VPEs, CMPs, CUIs, Joint Readiness Exercises, Flag Exercises, and other joint
exercises to evaluate and validate unit tactics, equipment, and training. If deficiencies are
identified they should be forwarded up the chain of command using a TIP, TAAR, or other
appropriate method/process. Processes described in the following paragraphs help to satisfy this
requirement.
AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012                                                               35


6.4. Designed Operational Capabilities (DOC) Statements and Mission Essential Task
Listings (METL). Tacticians at all organizational levels must monitor their tactical
environments and operational requirements to ensure DOC Statements/METLs correctly express
capabilities, or offer resolutions to disconnects between requirements and capabilities. As a
minimum, review the unit’s DOC Statement/METL upon assuming duty as a unit tactician and
once annually. Although HQ AFSOC/A3VT is responsible for coordinating and managing the
tactics/tactical employment portions of these processes, subordinate units must provide their
insight to effectively influence DOC Statements/METLs. Units should submit proposed changes
to DOC Statements and/or METLs through operational command channels.

                             INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

7.1. General. The efficient flow and availability of tactics and information related to tactical
employment is essential to an effective tactics program. Tacticians must implement processes
that enable aircrews to access information when needed, and ensure that the information is
available during hours of flight operations at all levels to ensure successful combat readiness.
Tactics information management is divided into four categories: AFSOC Tactics websites,
cross-tell, publications, and tactics program event results.
7.2. Tactics On-line. Unclassified and classified websites are available for use in management
of tactics programs. Suggestions for improvements to any of the on-line resources should be sent
electronically to HQ AFSOC/A3VT (afsoc.a3tw.dl@hurlburt.af.mil).
   7.2.1. Static AFSOC/A3VT webpages containing staff contacts and other useful info may be
   found        on      the       AF     Portal     at:            https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channel          PageId=s6925EC134F450FB5E044080020E329A9.
   The NIPR ATIMS web page provides document sharing/management and discussion forums
   for use at the unclassified level. ATIMS is a sub site under the HQ AFSOC/A3TW page on
   the AFSOC Enterprise Information System (EIS) and is located at:
   https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TW/ATIMS/default.aspx.           ATIMS access is
   restricted to ―.mil‖ and ―.gov‖ domains; users must register for an external user account in
   order to access any AFSOC EIS page from an official government computer not located at
   either Hurlburt Field FL, or Cannon AFB NM (https://registration.afsoc.af.mil/
   layouts/EPAS/Registration/Request.aspx).
   7.2.2. A classified ATIMS page is available on the HQ AFSOC SOFnet SharePoint Portal as
   a sub site under the HQ AFSOC/A3TW page. This page provides similar capabilities to
   tacticians and aircrew for classified use (up to Secret) via the Secret Internet Protocol Router
   Network       (SIPRNET).             Locate      the     classified     ATIMS        page    at:
   http://afsofnet.afsoc.af.smil.mil/sites/a3/a3t/
   tacticians/ATIMS.
7.3. Cross-tell. Sharing of information among units benefits the larger tactician community by
increasing aircrew situational awareness and reducing duplicated effort. Information can be
disseminated through unit briefings, electronic messages, TIFP participation, and via tactics
publications and newsletters.
7.4. Publications.
   7.4.1. Tactics Library. Each tactics office must maintain a library of publications essential
   to the operation of the unit tactics program and effective mission planning, along with those
   related to the defensive systems installed on their aircraft, and, if desired, any other basic EW
   publications. As a minimum, units must maintain the publications listed in Table 7.1 (either
   printed or electronic, as specified). Group and squadron tactics offices must also maintain an
   appropriate deployable library to satisfy UTC requirements, as well as allow access to critical
   information during periods of network inaccessibility.

   7.4.2. AFTTP 3-1 and 3-3. HQ AFSOC/A3VT is responsible for coordinating updates to
   Tactics Handbooks and AFTTP volumes for AFSOC MDS aircraft. AFSOC group and
   squadron tacticians must identify potential changes to the publications. Unit tactician
   representatives are required to participate in volume updates to ensure theater-relevant
   information is incorporated. The 561 JTS or HQ AFSOC/A3 will publish Interim Changes
   or page changes to update publication information between revisions. All crew members will
   be issued a printed copy of their respective unclassified AFTTP.

   7.4.3. AFSOCI 11-207. HQ AFSOC publishes AFSOCI 11-207 to define the tactics
   program, responsibilities, and processes. This document must meet group and squadron
   tactics requirements to maintain combat ready aircrews and provide the appropriate expertise
   to unit leadership. To ensure unit requirements are met, group and squadron tacticians must
   take an active part in providing inputs to AFSOCI 11-207.
   7.4.4. Other Publications. AFSOC participation in multi-command, joint, and combined
   operations across the entire spectrum of conflict provides the opportunity to make
   meaningful contributions to the improvement of many publications that influence AFSOC
   operations. AFSOC units should provide recommended changes to these publications to HQ
   AFSOC/A3VT. HQ AFSOC/A3VT will consider these inputs when coordinating on the
   publications.
   7.4.5. Special Operations Mission Planning Folder (SOMPF). Unit tacticians must be
   familiar with all known unit employment taskings (i.e., specified in standing OPLANs or
   CONPLANs) to ensure unit crew members are prepared to meet such requirements.
   Tacticians (both group and squadron) are required to review all OPLANs that contain
   specific missions to their unit’s MDS annually. Dividing this plan up throughout the year
   facilitates incorporating the annual review with use of a plan in a group/unit VPE. These
   reviews then enable unit tacticians to verify accuracy of plan contents and update its
   materials. In compliance with Joint Publication 3-05.1, Joint Special Operations Task Force
   Operations theater and unified commands’ OPLANs and CONPLANs, SOMPFs consolidate
   essential preplanned operational and intelligence data required for mission execution. The
   SOMPF contains preplanning data and necessary intelligence information required to support
   specific CONPLANs and OPLANs. SOMPFs are only required for tasked missions taken
   from Level 4 OPLANs that contain sufficient detail to plan the mission. SOMPFs may be
   stored in approved storage containers in unit tactics, plans, or intel, but must be readily
   accessible to unit tacticians. A record of all SOMPFs will be maintained listing currency of
   annual reviews. Upon mobilization, the SOMPF becomes the nucleus of information
   required to plan these missions. The SOMPF will assist mission planners in building the
   aircrew’s mission folders. The SOMPF will be constructed IAW Joint Publication 3-05.1.
Note: For 6 SOS, theater representatives in 6 SOS maintain SOMPFs for downrange missions.
The 6 SOS standard operating procedures direct format and content for SOMPFs, which meet all
of the requirements of AFSOCI 11-207.
   7.4.6. HQ AFSOC/A3VT is responsible for collecting and distributing tactics information in
   the form of Tactics Bulletins. Unit inputs are essential to the success of this process. Tactics
   Bulletins announce HQ AFSOC/A3VT policies, advertise job and school openings, and
   provide a forum for discussing the latest issues and developments affecting tactics. Submit
   articles and feedback for the bulletins directly to HQ AFSOC/A3VT via written
   correspondence                                                                               to:
   HQ AFSOC/A3VT, 100 Bartley St, Suite 141W, Hurlburt Field FL, 32544, or electronically
   at: afsoc.a3tw.dl@hurlburt.af.mil.
   7.4.7. Final/Interim Test Reports. Test reports are prepared and made available by the 18
   FLTS. These reports are available from the 18 FLTS page on the classified AFSOFnet
   portal, accessible at http://afsofnet.afsoc.af.smil.mil/sites/18flts/default.aspx as well as the
AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012                                                               39


   Defense Technical Information Center page at https://webs.dtic.smil.mil. Tacticians should
   check these pages periodically for test reports and updates.
7.5. Major Program Events.
   7.5.1. The annual Tactics Conference and Tactics Working Groups (TWG) produce
   important information and require appropriate participation. Tactics conferences and TWGs
   encourage information cross flow among crew members and provide potential
   solutions/approaches to tactical problems. TWGs should be held at the group level and
   conducted on an annual basis or when issues dictate with results forwarded to HQ
   AFSOC/A3VT, not later than end of September, each year.

                              SPECIAL TACTICS PROGRAM

9.1. General. HQ AFSOC is designated as the lead command for developing, documenting, and
disseminating tactics for Air Force Special Operations Forces (AFSOF), AFSOC-gained Air
National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Component (AFRC) forces. Tactics incorporate
all facets involved with accomplishing assigned combat missions and are not limited to airborne
weapon systems/assets. Any personnel with duties that may involve engagement of the enemy
while executing the mission on the ground, or in the air, must be involved in the tactics process.
This includes mission planning, rehearsal, employment, ground movement, communications,
actions on objectives, weapons employment, infiltration, exfiltration, and any support required
for mission success.
9.2. Tactics Program Goal and Objectives. The Tactics Program is designed to facilitate

9.6. Tactics Development and Improvement Program. Tactics development is a process that
starts early in the weapons system acquisition cycle and continues through weapon system
retirement. The responsibility to develop proposals for tactics, tasking, and procedural changes
rests with all AFSCs that comprise the system or support its employment. The TDIP ensures that
lessons learned are properly collected, documented, and disseminated throughout the weapon
system. Active participation of all unit personnel, along with unit commander emphasis, is the
key to success in this critical process. (Chapter 4 of this instruction provides additional TDIP
guidance.)
   9.6.1. Guardian Angel Consolidated Mission Report.
       9.6.1.1. A Guardian Angel Consolidated Mission Report will be accomplished after any
       operational mission employment of Combat Rescue Officer or Pararescue and submitted
       to 720/724 STG.
   9.6.2. AF Form 4326, Tactics Improvement Proposal (TIP).
       9.6.2.1. Use AF Form 4326, IAW AFI 11-260, to address a tactical deficiency or to
       capture new or previously undocumented tactics found to be effective.
       9.6.2.2. All missions will be reviewed at the unit level for tactical deficiencies, new or
       previously undocumented tactics found to be effective, recommended TTP to improve the
       use of current equipment, and any other items of tactical concern to the command. TIPs
       should be staffed from the squadron tactics office to the 720/724 STG tactics office. 720
       STG will staff to HQ AFSOC A3/TW.
   9.6.3. 720 STG After Action Report (AAR).
       9.6.3.1. 720 STG AARs support the warfighter by providing timely, tactically significant
       information and are used to provide significant lessons learned and cross-tell throughout
       the Special Tactics community.
   9.6.4. Immediate Tactics After Action Report (I-TAAR).
       9.6.4.1. An I-TAAR is used to disseminate tactically significant, time-sensitive
       information of immediate concern to the warfighter.
   9.6.5. AFSOC Form 93, Test Request.
       9.6.5.1. The AFSOC Form 93 is used to identify information required to validate and
       plan an Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). In some instances, some of the
       identified information is not known or available to the requestor. However, the requestor
       should obtain as much data as possible and is encouraged to submit a complete form.
       Use AFSOC HOI 71-5 to complete the form. Submit completed AFSOC 93s to 720/724
       STG tactics office for review and forwarding to HQ AFSOC/A3.
9.7. Tactics Review Board. Units will conduct annual TRBs NLT 15 September each year to
review current tactics and suggest changes to correct deficiencies in those tactics. Squadron
 44                                                         AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012


TRBs should formulate and forward TIPs in the areas identified in Paragraph 1.4 of AFI 11-260.
AFI 11-260 also provides group and headquarters TRB responsibilities. Forward TRB results to
the 720/724 STG.
9.8. Tactics Training. Special Tactics Officer/Combat Control tactics training guidance is
governed by CFETP 1C2X1, AFI 13-112V1, and AFSOCI 36-2204. CRO/Pararescue personnel
training guidance is governed by CFETP 1T2X1and AFI 10-3502, Volumes 1 and 2.
   9.8.1. Combat operations can include complex tasks executed within limited time
   constraints, coupled with enemy threat and adverse environmental conditions. To enable
   mission success under these difficult conditions, commanders and tacticians must maintain a
   realistic combat focus to tactical training. This focus must guide planning, execution, and
   assessment of the training program to ensure operators realistically train as they are going to
   fight.
   9.8.2. Squadron tacticians will provide, or coordinate with appropriate organizations to
   provide quarterly tactics briefings on subjects relevant to the squadron’s mission, tactics, and
   tactical employment capabilities.
9.9. Tactics Assessment Program. Comply with Chapter 6 of this instruction.
9.10. Information Management. The efficient flow and availability of information is essential
to an effective tactics program. (Refer to Chapter 7 of this instruction.)
   9.10.1. Squadron tacticians must have SIPRNET access in the unit and adequate classified
   storage space to properly manage tactics information.
   9.10.2. Tactics Library Publications. As a minimum, units must maintain the following
   publications. See Table 9.1 Special Tactics Required Tactics Publications.

                                      (CLASSIFICATION)
A3.1. Tactics After Action Report (TAAR). A TAAR is used to highlight something of
tactical significance that should be elevated through coordination to HQ AFSOC/A3VT for
either wider dissemination or consideration for inclusion into next MDS TTP rewrite. The
TAAR may also be added to the Lessons Learned database for further resourcing. TAARs
should provide sufficient background to ―stand alone‖ without need to contact originator for
additional information. Refer to Figure A3.2 and both the classified and unclassified ATIMS
websites for additional information regarding TAARs.
A3.2. Immediate-Tactics After Action Report (I-TAAR). An I-TAAR is used to rapidly alert
HQ AFSOC/A3VT to a recent situation which, if not staffed quickly enough, could result in a
 60                                                         AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012


potentially severe follow-on recurrence. Although impossible to define every possible situation
warranting an I-TAAR, events such as SAFIRES, critical TTP employment errors in new
situations/tactics, etc., should be captured in an I-TAAR by unit tactics personnel with unit Chief
of Tactics concurrence. Forward dual-channel to the group weapons and tactics office and
concurrently to HQ AFSOC/A3VT to ensure quickest action and dissemination as appropriate.
I-TAARs should provide only the essence of the event (i.e., what happened, tactic employed,
success of tactics, result of employment/engagement, originator’s unit and contact information –
phone, SIPR and NIPR e-mail address).
A3.3. TAARs and I-TAARs are written by a unit tactics representative with information
provided by either the individual involved with the TAAR and I-TAAR situation, or as extracted
from a mission commander’s report.
A3.4. All TAARs and I-TAARs are validated by the unit chief of weapons and tactics either
electronically or on paper. Note: By their very nature, I-TAARs should not be delayed until put
on paper, but should be sent electronically as soon as practical/possible.

                SPECIAL OPERATIONS MISSION PLANNING FOLDER

A4.1. Special Operations Mission Planning Folder (SOMPF). A package that contains the
materials required to execute a given special operations mission. All feasibility assessment/
initial assessment taskings transmitted through the appropriate component prompt the creation of
a SOMPF.
   A4.1.1. Mission Tasking Package (MTP). MTP provides documentation and guidance
   provided by the Commander, Joint Special Operations Task Force (CDRJSOTF) to the
   Mission Planning Agent (MPA) that provides basic guidance for target planning. It contains
   the tasking and administrative framework within which a given mission is planned. See
   below for the SOMPF format for contingency planning that is used by the Theater Special
   Operations Command (TSOC).

Table A4.1. Mission Tasking Package.
                         MISSION TASKING PACKAGE

  A4.1.2. Feasibility Assessment (FA). An FA is an initial determination of the viability of a
  proposed mission/target for SOF employment. It essentially answers the SOF operational
  mission criteria questions: Is it an appropriate SOF mission? Does it support the JFC’s
  OPLAN(s)? Is it operationally feasible? Are required resources available? Does the
  expected outcome justify the risk? The method used to answer the above questions is an
  abbreviated version of mission analysis and COA development, analysis, and selection. The
  process steps are as described below:
  A4.1.3. Target Intelligence Package (TIP). As part of the SOMPF, the J-2 is responsible for
  preparing TIPs with the support of the theater JIOC to support the targeting and mission
  planning process. TIPs provide information on target identification, environment, threat,
  demographics, LOCs, infiltration and exfiltration routes, survival data, and other intelligence
  information required for study by the SOF unit assigned the mission.
  A4.1.4. Concept Of Operations (CONOP). Summarizes what the JSOTF wants the mission
  to accomplish without specifying how to do it. Provides the JSOTF commander’s intent and
  the desired effects. Avoids excessive detail that may limit the mission planning agent’s
  planning. Does not make assumptions regarding techniques.
  A4.1.5. Mission Support Plans. Mission support plans complement the CONOP. The
  mission support plan is written by the supporting agency that will be tasked to conduct the
  insertion or exfiltration should the mission be tasked.

               TACTICS ASSOCIATED PROCESSES AND PROGRAMS

A5.1. Tactics Associated Processes and Programs.
   A5.1.1. Test Request. (HQ AFSOC/A3F) Use AFSOC Form 93, Test Request, to request a
   test. The AFSOC Form 93 identifies information needed to validate and plan an Operational
   Test and Evaluation (OT&E). OT&Es are an integral part of a system’s life cycle to ensure
   the Air Force acquires and maintains operationally effective and suitable systems that meet
   user requirements. A Force Development Evaluation (FDE) is a subset of OT&E that is
   focused on the MAJCOM’s requirements after initial acquisition process and testing. A
   Tactics Development and Evaluation (TD&E) is a subset of FDE specifically designed to
   further exploit system capabilities and tactics during the sustainment portion of the system’s
   life cycle. It includes research, demonstration, exercise, analysis, and evaluation of specific
   employment tactics.
      A5.1.1.1. Quick Look Project/Immediate War Requirement. Quick Look Projects and
      Immediate War Requirements are processes for HQ AFSOC/A3 to request and receive
      immediate test support for requirements or deficiencies that could result in injury,
      damage or loss of AFSOC personnel or resources. Refer to AFSOC HOI 71-5 for
      guidance.
   A5.1.2. Aircraft Modification. (HQ AFSOC/A4MX) Use AF Form 1067, Modification
   Proposal, to request a modification to an AFSOC aircraft. The AF Form 1067 must be used
   to document all modifications that change the form, fit, function, or interface per AFI 63-
   1101, of a configured item (aircraft) as determined by the responsible System Program
   Director (SPD). Modification proposals require specific funding and approval procedures
   based on dollar cost. AFI 10-601, Capabilities-Based Requirements Development, AFSOCI
   10-601, AFI & AFSOCSI 63-1101, Modification Management, outline the dollar limits and
   procedures for submitting the AF Form 1067. Submit the AF Form 1067 to HQ
   AFSOC/A4MX. HQ AFSOC/A4MX will assign an AFSOC control number and pass to the
   appropriate Weapons System Integrated Product Team (WSIPT) for disposition/action. HQ
   AFSOC/A5 provides the WSIPT leader who reviews all modifications to their respective
   aircraft. The WSIPT leader recommends to the AFSOC Configuration Review Board (CRB)
   either the proposal be validated as a command requirement or disapproved. CRB validated
   modification proposals are forwarded to the respective aircraft SPD for engineering
   evaluation and Single Manager (SM) CCB approval. SM/CCB approval is required prior to
   all configuration changes.
      A5.1.2.1. High-Cost Capabilities Development.      Issues that involve significant
      commitment of command resources will require development of capability documents as
      described in AFI 10-601 and/or USSOCOM D 71-4. What constitutes a significant
      commitment of command resources will be determined by the AFSOC Corporate
      Structure.
   A5.1.3. T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution. (HQ
   AFSOC/A4M) Request for software changes and occurrences of equipment failing to
   operate to specifications should be submitted using the USAF DR using the Deficiency
   Reporting Entry and Mail System (DREAMS) or via INFOCEN/JDRS. HQ AFSOC/A4M is
AFSOCI11-207 16 AUGUST 2012                                                                    65


   responsible for these reports and Maintenance Quality Assurance is responsible for the
   process. When a software deficiency affects tactics or tactical employment capability,
   tacticians should submit an Operational Change Request (OCR) with the USAF DR using the
   DREAMS format and coordinate with maintenance Quality Assurance. Tacticians should
   follow the progress of the DR to resolve the deficiency.
   A5.1.4. Change of Flight Manual. (HQ AFSOC/A3V) Use AF Form 847, Recommendation
   for Change of Publication, when requesting a change to a flight manual. Submit and process
   all request for changes to flight manuals electronically on an AF Form 847 through
   MAJCOM channels IAW AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program, to HQ AFSOC/A3V.
   A5.1.5. Initial Capabilities Documents (ICD), formerly Mission Needs Statements (MNS),
   Urgent Operational Need (UON), Capability Production Document (CPD), Combat
   Capability Documents (CCD), for Air Force capabilities, and Combat Mission Need
   Statements (CMNS) for SOF capabilities (HQ AFSOC/A5KR). Capability documents are a
   basis for material solutions and seek to establish a new operational capability, exploit an
   opportunity to reduce costs, or enhance mission performance. AFSOC organizations shall
   first try to satisfy mission needs through non-material solutions, such as changes in doctrine,
   TTP, or training. AFSOC Directors sponsor new proposals for an ICD. AFSOCI 10-601 and
   AFI 10-601 describe the processes. Coordinate with HQ AFSOC/A5KR for format, content,
   and procedure. AFSOC organizations shall first try to satisfy capability gaps/shortfalls
   through non-materiel resolutions such as changes in doctrine, organization, training,
   leadership and education, personnel, and facilities. If the capability cannot be achieved
   through a non-materiel resolution, then the new capability requires a materiel solution.
A5.2. Additional Assessment Requirements. HQ AFSOC/A3VT, with support from
subordinate units, must integrate with other processes to identify and implement opportunities
for improvement. The 18 FLTS and other test agencies, through HQ AFSOC/A3F, often request
a unit/weapon system representative appropriate for each project/test. The unit/weapon system
representative should be an experienced crew member and tactician. The unit representative is
invited to all test plan working groups, has a significant impact in shaping the assessment
process, assists in coordinating squadron assets to support test requirements, and is vital for
timely feedback to AFSOC units.
