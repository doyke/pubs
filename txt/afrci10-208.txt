       captured L2 will be validated through a corporate process and assigned an action OPR for resolu-
       tion. Once resolved, the L2 will be closed through the same corporate process and disseminated
       as appropriate.
   6.2. HQ AFRC/A3O will:
       6.2.1. Coordinate CAT hours of operation/manning based on the current manning level as deter-

7. AFRC CAT Duty Positions. The AFRC CAT consists of a director, executive officers, Functional
Area Representatives (FAR) and information managers (Figure 1.). The total number of personnel
required to run the AFRC CAT is situation dependent. For example, steady-state operations will not nor-
mally require 24/7 operations while a surge operation will. Directorates/Divisions will determine the
additional personnel needed to sustain surge operations for an indefinite period of time. Manning levels
are defined in paragraph 8.
   7.1. CAT Director (CD).
       7.1.1. Duties: The HQ AFRC/A2A3 is responsible for the overall performance and execution of
       the AFRC CAT and has designated the HQ AFRC/A3O Division chief as the Senior CD (SCD).
           7.1.1.1. The SCD is AFRC/A2A3 executive agent to oversee CAT operations to include pol-
           icy, staffing, facilities and training. The SCD is the advocate to obtain funding for CAT oper-
           ations and infrastructure. The SCD coordinates CD scheduling and training.
           7.1.1.2. The CD is AFRC/CV’s representative for command tasking and information during
           ongoing crises or contingencies and is responsible for directing all CAT actions in response to
           crisis or higher headquarters taskings. The CD, in concert with the senior staff, will approve
           all issues, changes to procedures, concepts, execution-planning considerations, or taskings to
           outside agencies. The CD, as AFRC/CV’s direct representative, has tasking authority over all
           personnel (CXO, IM, or FAR) detailed to the CAT for operations regardless of where they are
           assigned.
       7.1.2. CD training requirements are listed in paragraph 9.
   7.2. CAT Executive Officer (CXO).
6                                                                          AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008


       7.2.1. Primary CXO Duties.
           7.2.1.1. The CXO is directly responsible to the CD. The CXO serves as the senior on-duty
           officer/supervisor in the absence of the CD. The CXO is the focal point for all activities and
           has the responsibility and authority to ensure procedures are followed and required tasks are
           accomplished.
           7.2.1.2. Prepare, coordinate and staff packages IAW guidance in the AFRC AO Information
           Page (located on the NIPRnet at https://wwwmil.cv.afrc.af.mil/AO%20Page.html.) and
           applicable CAT work guides and checklists.
           7.2.1.3. AFRC utilizes teams organized from A2A3 with augmentation from other Director-
           ates to provide CXOs that ensure the smooth flow of information through the CAT and provide
           guidance to CAT FARs and CAT IM.
           7.2.1.4. During steady state operations, two standby CXOs are designated to allow the CAT to
           quickly ramp up to 24/7 operations.
           7.2.1.5. During surge operations, the A2A3 teams of CXOs will be augmented by other Direc-
           torates to sustain 24/7 coverage.
           7.2.1.6. CXO training requirements are listed in paragraph 9.
       7.2.2. Standby CXO Duties.
           7.2.2.1. During steady state operations, two standby CXOs are designated by their team lead-
           ers. After normal duty hours the standby CXOs should be available to report for duty within 2
           hours of notification.
           7.2.2.2. In the absence of the assigned CXO (illness, TDY, leave, etc.) the standby CXOs will
           fill in during normal duty hours. This will be by prior coordination with the team leader who
           has responsibility for that day(s) if at all possible.
    7.3. CAT Information Management (IM).
       7.3.1. Duties. CAT IM performs staff support duties. Basic IM duties include:
           7.3.1.1. AMHS message traffic handling and preparation.
           7.3.1.2. General administrative duties.
           7.3.1.3. Website updates.
           7.3.1.4. Client Support Administrator (CSA).
           7.3.1.5. Other tasks as assigned by the CAT Director or Executive Officer.
       7.3.2. CAT IM training requirements are listed in paragraph 9.
    7.4. Communications Support Team. The Directorate of Communications (A6) will provide dedi-
    cated communications support to the AFRC CAT/Operations center when activated. The AFRC CAT/
    Operations Center is formed in a virtual workspace rather than collocated physical workspace. This
    results in heavy dependency on communications for internal as well as external processes. The criti-
    cal need for immediate response to communications issues to include NIPRNET, SIPRNET and tele-
    communications drives a requirement for on-site support.
    7.5. CAT Functional Area Representatives (FARs).
AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008                                                                               7


      7.5.1. Duties. FARs are those individuals designated by a Directorate to represent their Func-
      tional Area(s) on each shift during CAT operations. Each FAR reports directly to the CD when
      they are assigned by their Directorate to support CAT operations. The CD will task FARs as nec-
      essary to accomplish any or all of the CAT duties listed in para 4.1.1. through 4.1.6. Due to the
      time-sensitive nature of CAT operations the FAR is required to function as an authoritative subject
      matter expert for his/her functional area. This requires FARs to be knowledgeable, experienced,
      and empowered to represent, and make decisions, on behalf of their Director and functional com-
      munity. Basic FAR duties are:
          7.5.1.1. Identify, recommend sourcing and track all deployed AFRC resources in support of

      instruction for other CAT personnel or those tasks assigned by the CAT Director or Executive
      Officer. They can be Traditional Reservists assigned to HQ AFRC or personnel from NAFs, units
      or IMAs. Length of assignment will vary based on the specific mission the augmentee was
      brought into the CAT to perform.
      7.6.2. CAT augmentee training requirements are the same as for the position they are filling
      (listed in paragraph 9.). CAT Exec and IM augmentees work directly for the CD.

8. CAT Operations:
   8.1. Manning Requirements. The AFRC CAT will respond and be manned according to five levels of
   activity. At all levels, the CAT DIR may adjust manning requirements as needed. Figure 1. depicts
   standard CAT operations at all five levels of activity. The letters “A” and “B” in the columns repre-
   sent 12 hour “A” and “B” shifts. Shifts that are shaded must be manned. Unshaded shifts are on-call.

     8.1.1. Shifts will normally be twelve hours with sufficient overlap for the departing shift to brief
     oncoming personnel. The CAT Director may alter the length of shifts at any level of CAT opera-
     tions. Each Directorate may alter the length of shifts for their personnel in coordination with the
     CAT Director, provided the established shift is covered (ex., Two 6 hour shifts rather than one
     twelve hour shift).
     8.1.2. Level 1. The CAT will be fully manned, all personnel in-place, for 24/7 operations. The
     CAT DIR may adjust manning requirements depending on current circumstances. Each position
     will provide continuous manning for work shifts. Changeover briefs during 24-hour operations
     will normally be at 1300Z and 0001Z. Changeover times may vary depending on the contingency
     and will be defined and approved by the CAT Director.
     8.1.3. Level 2. The primary CAT positions will be manned 24/7. The GO and FAR positions will
     be manned during an extended duty day and on-call during non-duty hours. The actual hours of
     operation are dependent upon the contingency and will be defined and approved by the CAT
     Director.
     8.1.4. Level 3. The CAT Executive Officer and Administrative Support Team will be manned 24/
     7. The Director, primary FARs, CST and IST will be manned during duty hours and on-call dur-
     ing non-duty hours. The GO and all other FARS will be on-call. The actual hours of operation are
     dependent upon the contingency and will be defined and approved by the CAT Director. At all
     times there will be a designated CAT Director available.
     8.1.5. Level 4 (Steady State). The CAT Director, Executive Officer and AST will be manned dur-
     ing duty hours and on-call during non-duty hours through the AFRC Command Center. All other
     positions are on-call. At all times there will be a designated CAT Director available. The Execu-
     tive Officer will ensure the CAT is secured during non-duty hours and forward the CAT phone
     lines to the AFRC Command Center. The AFRC Command Center will contact the on-call CD/
     CXO on any CAT issue after duty hours.
     8.1.6. Level 5 (Steady State). The CAT Executive Officer and AST are manned during normal
     duty hours and on-call during non-duty hours. All other positions are on-call. At all times there
     will be a designated CAT Director available. The Executive Officer will ensure the CAT is
     secured during non-duty hours and forward the CAT phone lines to the AFRC Command Center.
     The AFRC Command Center will contact the on-call CD/CXO on any CAT issue after duty hours.
AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008                                                                                9


  8.2. Steady-State Operations.
     8.2.1. Levels 4 and 5 are used for steady-state operations. The AFRC CAT operates as the AFRC
     Operations Center during steady state and is responsible for routine or on-going contingency oper-
     ations that are handled during normal duty hours. Functional areas must keep their FARs
     informed on the current situation and taskings to allow for smooth transitions.
     8.2.2. Most members can accomplish their CAT duties from their offices. CAT members must
     check their CAT SIPRNET and NIPRNET at least once each workday (NLT 1200L) and more as
     ops tempo increases in order to process taskers.
     8.2.3. CAT members will ensure their functional area CAT recall roster is current and provided to
     the CAT IM no later than 1400L each Thursday.
     8.2.4. CAT members will maintain a log of the issues and events of the shift activities.
     8.2.5. The out-going CAT member will conduct a changeover briefing with the on-coming CAT
     member and ensure they are aware of open/upcoming taskers.
  8.3. Surge Operations.
     8.3.1. Levels 1 – 3 are used for surge operations. The CAT will be manned for the duration of the
     incident at the discretion of the CAT Director. Normally two CAT Executive Officers are sched-
     uled per shift during surge operations.
     8.3.2. CAT members will report to the CAT and remain on duty until released by the CAT DIR or
     shift change.
     8.3.3. CAT members will ensure their functional area CAT recall roster is current and provided to
     CAT IM no later than 1400L each Thursday or as changes occur.
     8.3.4. CAT members will maintain a log of the issues and events of the shift activities.
     8.3.5. The out-going CAT members will conduct a changeover briefing with their on-coming CAT
     members to ensure they are aware of open/upcoming taskers.
  8.4. Scheduling.
     8.4.1. CAT General Officer (GO) scheduling is coordinated by AFRC/ACV.
     8.4.2. CAT Director (CD) scheduling is accomplished by the Senior CAT Director (AFRC/A3O).
     The DA2A3 will accomplish this duty in the absence of the A3O. This duty may be further dele-
     gated by the DA2A3 to another O-6 or Civilian Division Chief.
         8.4.2.1. A CAT Director is always designated regardless of CAT activity level.
         8.4.2.2. If the CAT Director is not required to be on duty he/she will be available on an on-call
         basis.
     8.4.3. CAT Executive Officer(s) (CXO) are normally scheduled one per shift during steady state
     operations and two per shift during surge operations. AFRC/A3OC is the executive agent for
     CXO scheduling and training.
         8.4.3.1. Steady State requirements. The A2A3 Directorate will fill steady state requirements.
         Daily operations are covered by A3OC staff. Two additional CXOs will be scheduled on
10                                                                       AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008


            stand-by in case the CAT is activated or by prior arrangement to cover duty hours in the
            absence of A3OC CXO (TDY, Leave, etc.)
            8.4.3.2. Surge Requirements. During surge operations the A2A3 Directorate will continue to
            fill one CXO position and the other HQ Directorates will be tasked to fill a second CXO posi-
            tion.
            8.4.3.3. A3OC will build the schedule to meet requirements and task the Directorates for qual-
            ified personnel.
            8.4.3.4. Each Directorate will establish POC(s) to provide personnel to meet tasking.
        8.4.4. Information Management (CAT IM). Normally one IM specialist is scheduled per shift
        during steady state operations and at least two during surge operations. AFRC/A3OC is the exec-
        utive agent for CAT IM scheduling and training.
            8.4.4.1. Steady State requirements. The A2A3 Directorate will normally fill steady state
            requirements. Daily operations are covered by A3OC staff. A stand-by CAT IM is designated
            in case the CAT is activated or by prior arrangement to cover duty hours in the absence of
            A3OC CAT IM (TDY, Leave, etc.)
            8.4.4.2. Surge requirements. A3O will designate a CAT IM scheduler. The scheduler will
            assign IM personnel from all Directorates to meet CAT requirements in coordination with the
            supervising Branch Chief. The limited number of IM personnel available in the HQ makes
            support by all Directorates critical and may require augmentation to support long term opera-
            tions.
        8.4.5. Communications Support Team. The Directorate of Communications (A6) will provide
        dedicated communications support to the AFRC CAT/Operations center when activated.
            8.4.5.1. Steady State Operations. During steady state operations (Levels 4 and 5) AFRC/A6
            will provide support to the CAT/Operations Center through normal staff functions and on-call
            personnel. The AFRC CAT/Operations Center Exec will work with AFRC/A6N to establish
            priorities if required.
            8.4.5.2. Surge Operations. During surge operations (Levels 1 - 3) AFRC/A6 will plan to pro-
            vide a dedicated on-site CST to support the CAT/Operations Center for the first 72 hours pro-
            viding on site coverage within the CAT duty hours and on call coverage outside of CAT duty
            hours. The AFRC CAT/Operations Center Director and AFRC/A6N will determine further
            requirements or approve changes to team composition if required. The team will consist of
            two personnel with NIPRNET and SIPRNET Administrator privileges.
        8.4.6. Functional Area Representatives (FAR). Each Director/Division Chief is responsible for
        scheduling their FARs for duty and on-call requirements as defined by CAT Activity Level and
        CAT Director requirements. Directors/Division Chiefs will ensure their functional area CAT
        recall roster is current and provided to CAT IM no later than 1400L each Thursday.
     8.5. Notification/Recall Procedures.
        8.5.1. CAT recalls will be conducted at the discretion of AFRC/CC, AFRC/CV, AFRC/A2A3 or
        the Senior CAT DIR. At a minimum, the CAT notification procedures will be exercised via a
        quarterly CAT recall. If a CAT recall occurs outside duty hours, the AFRC Command Center will
        recall the primary CAT members and Commander’s Support Staff as directed. The CXO will
AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008                                                                               11


      recall applicable CAT FARs. When recalled, personnel are to report to duty in uniform. If a FAR
      cannot be contacted, the applicable Director/Division chief will be contacted for an immediate
      replacement. The CAT will be capable of full operations within 2 hours of activation.
      8.5.2. Notification/Recall Options.
          8.5.2.1. Full CAT Recall. All members are required to report to the CAT to be briefed on an
          incident or contingency operation. A full CAT recall can also be used to periodically exercise
          the recall system.
          8.5.2.2. Selected CAT Recall (as determined by the on-duty CD). Selected members are
          recalled to the CAT based on the expertise needed for the situation.
          8.5.2.3. During off duty hours (holidays and weekends) taskers may come in that require
          immediate action. The CXO will make the initial assessment on who will be recalled.
   8.6. Battle Rhythm. The battle rhythm detailed in Table 1. is the standard battle rhythm for the HQ
   AFRC CAT. The CAT Director in coordination with Senior Leadership has the authority to adjust
   times and events to suit the current situation. Additionally the CAT Director may excuse FARs from
   participation in an event or eliminate an event altogether when not required.

     8.7. Continuity of Operations (COOP).
         8.7.1. HQ AFRC Plans and Readiness Division (HQ AFRC/A3X) Responsibilities. HQ AFRC/
         A3X is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for HQ AFRC Continuity of Operations and, as
         such, functions as the single point of contact for the CAT COOP. The Operations Plans Branch
         (HQ AFRC/A3XX) is the COOP executive agent and is responsible for planning and exercising
         COOP. The AFRC Vice Commander serves as the Primary ECG Team Director.
         8.7.2. HQ AFRC Current Operations Division (HQ AFRC/A3O) Responsibilities. HQ AFRC/
         A3O will oversee the maintenance of an alternate on-base location for CAT operations in the event
         the AFRC/CV or CAT Director determines the primary location is untenable. The HQ AFRC/
         A3OC as CAT executive agent will ensure successor organizations listed in the COOP are pro-

         8.7.3. Relocation Actions. The AFRC/A3O will maintain an on-base alternate CAT location with
         a minimum capability of SIPRNET and NIPRNET access, secure and non-secure voice and data
         telephones, and emergency power. If the AFRC CAT is forced to relocate, the CD/CXO will lead
         a relocation team to the alternate CAT location and establish temporary CAT operations until they
         are able to return safely to the primary CAT location or relieved. The relocation team will accom-
         plish the following tasks:
            8.7.3.1. Re-establish connectivity from the temporary location (SIPRNET, NIPRNET, tele-
            phone) and continue AFRC CAT Operations to the maximum extent possible while reconsti-
            tuting the CAT.
            8.7.3.2. Review the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) and pre-identify each functional
            area relocation team member.

         8.7.3.3. Determine manning levels needed to sustain full operations from the alternate loca-
         tion. Use the recommended manning levels listed in paragraph 8.1. as a starting point. Each
         contingency is different and the actual manning is situational dependent.
         8.7.3.4. Prepare/maintain log of open issues/taskers worked from the temporary location.
  8.8. Lessons Learned (L2). HQ AFRC/A9 is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the AFRC
  Lessons Learned (L2) program and, as such, functions as the single point of contact for L2 issues.
     8.8.1. Each Director is responsible for ensuring L2 are captured as close to real-time as possible
     and will appoint an OPR to ensure collection and submission into the Advanced Lessons Manage-
     ment System (ALMS) via the NIPRNet or SIPRNet as dictated by the classification of the infor-
     mation.
     8.8.2. The captured L2 will be validated through a corporate process and assigned an action OPR
     for resolution. Once resolved, the L2 will be closed through the same corporate process and dis-
     seminated as appropriate.
  8.9. Situation Brief (SITBRIEF).
     8.9.1. The Senior CAT Director (SCD) conducts the CAT Activation Briefing and the on duty
     CAT Director (CD) conducts subsequent briefings.
     8.9.2. A1, A2A3, A4, A5A8, A6 and A7 will submit their briefing inputs one hour prior to the
     scheduled SITBRIEF. All slide inputs will be submitted to the GCCS shared drive (wrbdm2) at
     X:\CAT BRIEFS-REPORTS\ Current Situation Briefing Folder. Specific requirements for each
     Directorate are outlined in Table 1. SITBRIEF Format.
     8.9.3. Other AFRC 2-digits will submit briefing inputs as required by the CD or at the discretion
     of the Director of the function (HC, JA, etc.). If a Director of a function elects to submit a briefing
     input it must be coordinated with the CAT Exec (CXO) and submitted to the shared drive folder at
     least one hour prior to the scheduled SITBRIEF.
     8.9.4. All briefing inputs will be in the template format specified by the SCD and submitted using
     the file name specified in Table 1. A slide template for each Directorate will be maintained on the
     GCCS shared drive (wrbdm2) at X:\CAT BRIEFS-REPORTS\Current Situation Briefing tem-
     plates. Templates will be named by functional area of the briefing (A2 template.ppt, A3 tem-
     plate.ppt, A4 template.ppt, etc.).
     8.9.5. Briefing requirements are established in Table 1. A Directorate, Division or Functional can
     be specified as the OPR and additional Directorates, Divisions or Functional may be named as
     OCRs for each briefing area. The OPR is responsible for timely submission and coordinating
     requirements and suspenses with the OCRs. Each OPR will provide the minimum requirements
     specified and may add additional elements at the discretion of the responsible Director. Directors
     will make every effort to format their briefing areas not to exceed a maximum of 10 minutes to
     include questions and answers.

their functional areas before they are assigned to CAT duty. AFRC/A3O is responsible for CAT familiar-
ization and continuation training.
     9.1. Training Concept: Personnel selected for CAT duty will go through a three-stage qualification
     training program. After initial training is complete, personnel must attend quarterly continuation
     training sessions.
        9.1.1. Initial screening. Each Director must select members for CAT duty based on the minimum
        qualifications listed in Table 3. The Senior CAT Director in coordination with the responsible
        Directorate may wave grade and experience requirements.
        9.1.2. Directorate training. An individual must complete the specific Directorate training respon-
        sibilities listed in the Table 4.
        9.1.3. A3O familiarization training. AFRC/A3O will provide familiarization briefings and tours
        on the specific equipment operations and force provision concepts and procedures. Specific train-
        ing events are listed in Table 5.
        9.1.4. A3O continuation training. All CAT personnel are required to complete continuation train-
        ing. Primary method of completion is by exercise participation. Alternate method of completion
        is listed in Table 6. and provided by AFRC/A3OC quarterly. The Senior CAT Director may
        exempt any CAT personnel or group from any or all CAT continuation training.
        9.1.5. AFRC/A3OC will maintain lists detailing CAT training and attendance.

10. Security Procedures. CAT/Ops Center members must possess at least a SECRET clearance, be on
the appropriate EAL and possess a badge coded with access to A2A3 and CAT/Ops Center areas. Direc-
AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008                                                                                    21


tors are responsible for processing required paperwork to ensure access is available for applicable person-
nel. Directors must make arrangements to escort personnel not on the EAL or without a properly coded
entry badge.
   10.1. CAT/Ops Center personnel must follow strict OPSEC and COMSEC procedures. No cellular
   phones, Personal Data Assistants (PDAs), pagers or Blackberry devices are allowed in the CAT/Ops
   Center. If you must bring these devices to the CAT, turn them off and leave them in the cabinet, in the
   CAT/Ops Center main entryway. CAT/Ops Center members will forward or place telephones on hold
   prior to briefings. Do not allow open lines during classified briefings.
   10.2. The CAT/Ops Center Director is responsible for the overall control of classified information;
   however, each CAT/Ops Center member has the responsibility to exercise control over his/her area.
   Personnel must take great care with discarded classified material. To keep classified material from
   inadvertent compromise, all documents including unclassified working papers will be shredded by
   FARs when no longer required. Shredders are located in the CAT/Ops Center admin and FAR areas.
   No paperwork of any kind will be mixed with the garbage/trash. Trash cans are not allowed in CAT/
   Ops Center working areas.
   10.3. CAT/Ops Center personnel will not leave classified papers unattended on their desks. The
   papers will be in binders or folders with proper classification markings on the outside. These binders
   or folders will be positioned so that personnel passing by are prevented from viewing their contents.
   When the CAT/Ops Center is not operating 24/7, all CAT/Ops Center personnel will properly secure
   or destroy all classified information in their work area prior to departing.

Section C—AFRC CAT/Operations Center Processes

11. Personnel Accountability in conjunction with National Emergencies or Natural Disasters.
   11.1. HQ AFRC CAT/Ops Center will be the command focal point for interfacing and coordinating
   personnel accountability requirements with AFRC Wings, NAFs and RMG. The AFRC CAT/Ops
   Center will assign tasker tracking numbers to each task in the accountability process to monitor and
   report status in coordination with AFRC/A1 to HHQ and HQ AFRC agencies.
   11.2. The AFRC Director of Manpower and Personnel (HQ AFRC/A1) as the office of primary
   responsibility (OPR) for AFRC personnel accountability establishes procedures to provide for the
   timely accountability of the categories of personnel.
   11.3. The Plans and Integration Division (HQ AFRC/A1X) is the executive agent for accountability
   and will monitor accountability data reported to higher headquarters and upon request provide the
   baseline totals for each personnel category.
   11.4. See AFRCI 10-218, Personnel Accountability in Conjunction with Natural Disasters or
   National Emergencies for detailed procedures.

12. DSCA Volunteer Capability Process. Ensures rapid identification and presentation of volunteer
forces and capabilities available to meet immediate requirements for Direct Support of Civilian Authori-
ties (DSCA) resulting from natural disaster or hostile actions within the United States and its territories, or
other reason approved by competent authority.
   12.1. General Procedures. There is a requirement for procedures to identify, verify, package and
   present volunteer forces from the Unit and Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) programs for
22                                                                         AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008


     DSCA. These procedures are designed to rapidly present AFRC volunteer capabilities to Service and
     Joint Commanders. Aircraft capability will be identified, sourced and tasked through AFRC/A3OO.
        12.1.1. The AFRC CAT/Ops Center will initiate the requirement to poll the command for volun-
        teer capability to meet DSCA requirements. This does not preclude subordinate commanders
        from initiating calls for volunteers within their organizations to meet local DSCA requirements.
        12.1.2. The AFRC AEF Cell (AFRC/A3M) is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for
        identifying and presenting AFRC volunteer capability.
        12.1.3. The AFRC War and Mobilization Branch (AFRC/A5XW) is the OPR for DSCA require-
        ments requiring mobilization. AFRC/A3M will continue to manage the volunteer process to assist
        in meeting these requirements.
        12.1.4. Numbered Air Forces (NAF), the Readiness Management Group (RMG) and HQ Func-
        tional Area Managers (FAM) are Offices of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) to identify, verify and
        package forces for presentation within their respective commands or functional areas as appropri-
        ate. Directorates may elect to centralize FAM coordination in their Plans (3-digit “X”) Division.
        12.1.5. The process to identify volunteers will flow from AFRC/A3M to the NAF/A5 and RMG/
        CAT. See Attachment 4.
            12.1.5.1. The NAF/A5 will forward to the Wing IDRC who in-turn will forward to assigned
            Squadrons and Geographically Separated Units.
            12.1.5.2. The RMG/CAT will forward to Program Managers who in-turn will forward to
            assigned IMAs and their active duty supervisors.
            12.1.5.3. HQ FARs will not process volunteers through functional channels. Volunteers will
            be processed through wing IDRC and Program Manager offices.
            12.1.5.4. The process to report results will follow the same channels. Organizations at all lev-
            els will keep their CAT/Operations Center/Command Post informed of progress and obtain
            any required commander approvals prior to initiating the call for volunteers or reporting
            results.
            12.1.5.5. In order to facilitate this process the primary communication system will be the
            unclassified network. If units are unable to present forces without disclosing classified infor-
            mation those forces will be presented using the classified network.
            12.1.5.6. The primary system to identify AFRC volunteer forces is the AFRC Volunteer Data-
            base. Should the Volunteer Database be inoperative units/Program Managers (PM) will report
            using the templates provided at Attachment 4, Volunteer Capabilities.
        12.1.6. Report Timing. This is a continuous process and all levels of command will report daily
        on known volunteers until relieved by the AFRC/ CAT/Ops Center. Geographically Separated
        Units (GSU) will report volunteers to the AFRC wing with their servicing Military Personnel
        Flight (MPF) as directed by that wing commander.
            12.1.6.1. Wings will report to the NAF and PMs to the RMG, by close of business on the day
            tasked to begin reporting. If 24/7 operations are directed, units/PMs will report by 1300Z.
            12.1.6.2. NAFs/RMG will verify, compile and report to AFRC/A3M by 1500Z.
AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008                                                                             23


         12.1.6.3. AFRC/A3M will compile and send updated volunteer data to AFRC FAMs by
         1600Z.
         12.1.6.4. AFRC FAMs will review and compile UTCs or changes to AFRC/A3M by 1800Z.
         Directorates may elect to centralize FAM coordination in their Plans (3-digit “X”) Division.
         12.1.6.5. AFRC/A3M will publish updated planning PID to AFRC CAT/Ops Center by
         2000Z.

Section D—NAF, RMG, WING CAT Procedures

13. NAF, RMG and Wing Contingency Operations:
   13.1. All AFRC NAFs, RMG and wings will maintain a CAT capability. CAT composition will
   ensure timely and appropriate response to all taskings in support of contingencies and exercise scenar-
   ios.
      13.1.1. Tenant AFRC wings/organizations provide a representative to the host base CAT when
      activated.
      13.1.2. Associate AFRC wings provide a representative to the associated wing CAT when acti-
      vated.
      13.1.3. Geographically Separated Units (GSU) should provide a representative to the host base
      CAT when activated.
   13.2. The commander will designate an OPR for CAT training and operations.
   13.3. NAF Command Centers, Wing Command Posts and designated RMG OPR will maintain a
   24-hour capability to recall the CAT and personnel in a timely manner either directly or by MOA with
   host wing command posts.
   13.4. When a full CAT response is determined to be inappropriate, the commander may use a tailored
   CAT, consisting of only those functional areas appropriate to the current situation.
   13.5. AFRC units / organizations will develop and maintain written guidance for CAT operations. In
   host/tenant situations, an addendum to host wing guidance may satisfy this requirement. As a mini-
   mum, guidance will consist of unit-specific checklists to effectively conduct contingency operations.
   Also consider including the following:
      13.5.1. CAT composition and functional responsibilities of members.
      13.5.2. Training procedures.
      13.5.3. Location of operations and physical configuration.
      13.5.4. Communications procedures and requirements, including alternates.
      13.5.5. Security procedures, including OPSEC and COMSEC requirements.
      13.5.6. Message traffic handling and logistic support procedures.
      13.5.7. Recall procedures for unit personnel.
   13.6. NAF Command Centers, Wing Command Posts and designated RMG OPR must immediately
   notify the AFRC Command Center (Wings also notify NAF Command center) when their CAT is acti-
   vated for a real-world situation. The AFRC Command Center duty controller will immediately notify
   the AFRC/A3O or DA2A3 who in-turn will brief AFRC/A2A3 to determine if HQ AFRC CAT/Ops
   Center activation is necessary.
26                                                                       AFRCI10-208 27 JUNE 2008


     13.7. NAF Command Centers, Wing Command Posts and designated RMG OPR will notify the
     AFRC Command Center (wings also notify NAF Command center) when CAT operations are termi-
     nated.

14. Exercises:
     14.1. Higher Headquarters Directed. Comply with paragraph 13. for Joint Chiefs of Staff or MAJ-
     COM directed exercises requiring Wing CAT activation.
     14.2. Unit Directed. Wings should exercise the CAT during unit-generated activity where a CAT
     would be appropriate.

15. Lessons Learned (L2): HQ AFRC/A9 is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the AFRC
L2 program and, as such, functions as the single point of contact for L2 issues. Commanders will appoint
an OPR for L2 collection and submission into the Advanced Lessons Management System (ALMS).
     15.1. Each Commander is responsible for ensuring L2 are captured as close to real-time as possible.
     L2 are to be submitted into the Advanced Lessons Management System (ALMS) via the NIPRNet or
     SIPRNet as dictated by the classification of the information.
     15.2. The captured L2 will be validated through a corporate process and assigned an action OPR for
     resolution. Once resolved, the L2 will be closed through the same corporate process and disseminated
     as appropriate.
