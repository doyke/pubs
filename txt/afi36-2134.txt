Strength accounting duty status program reporting assists commanders in supporting peace and
wartime mission requirements. The availability of strength accounting duty status information
allows commanders and functional managers to make informed force management decisions by
providing quick and accurate determination of names, numbers, and types of unit personnel
available for mission taskings. Strength accounting duty status reporting is event-oriented and
serves as a personnel accounting function. Strength accounting duty status conditions are
reported when an individual is projected to be or is in a strength accounting duty status condition
other than Present For Duty (PFD), as well as when he/she is subsequently returned to PFD per
Air Force Computer System Manual (AFCSM) 36-699, Military Personnel Data System
(MilPDS) User Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 13 or AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized
Absence.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: change title from duty status to strength accounting duty status; realigned roles and
responsibilities to reflect the organizational structure (Chapter 2); updated office symbols,
adopted forms and incorporated IC changes; removed all transactional “step by step” updates
which are now located in the Duty Status PSD Guide (Chapter 3); added information on the
Total Force Service Center and Case Management System; updated AFI, AFPD, and DoDI
references to their current title and publication date; updated the acronym listing and definitions;
and removed ARC strength accounting duty status codes 60, 70 and 71. In addition, the AFI
identifies tier waiver authority levels (T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3--Tier Waiver Authority definitions are
available in attachment 1, GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING
INFORMATION) for all compliance items for each wing, FOA, or DRU level task as specified
by Table 1.1 of AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

                                            Chapter 1

          STRENGTH ACCOUNTING DUTY STATUS PROGRAM REPORTING

1.1. Purpose. The Air Force Strength Accounting Duty Status Program (SADSP) exists to
enhance total force accountability and improve crisis responsiveness. The SADSP allows all
levels of command to access and maintain a centralized database depicting the current status of
the force and is designed to provide commanders, planners, and managers with strength-affecting
information. It encompasses all events causing a person to not be PFD. This data can be used in
making force management decisions. The SADSP is also a primary conduit for data impacting
Air Force personnel tempo (PERSTEMPO) and the payment of high-deployment pay
(Burdensome Tempo). Note: Effective 8 October 2001, the Deputy Secretary Defense
suspended the accumulation of deployment days for the purpose of determining eligibility for
high deployment per diem until further notice.
1.2. Objective. The objective of the SADSP is to capture and report all changes in a member’s
strength accounting duty status to ensure these changes, regardless of length are reported
immediately. Specifically, the SADSP provides a mechanism for Commanders and Military
Personnel Section (MPS) personnel to update data through Military Personnel Data System
(MilPDS).
1.3. Uses. Strength accounting duty status is much more than a process to identify the
availability or non-availability of personnel for duty. Commanders and agencies throughout the
Air Force and the Department of Defense (DoD) rely on information derived from strength
accounting duty status reporting to fulfill mission needs. The importance of accurate and timely
reporting must not be downplayed. Strength accounting duty status information is used:
     1.3.1. To document the utilization of Guard and Reserve personnel. This information affects
     man-day funding.
     1.3.2. To prevent the selection for assignment of deployed personnel who are non-volunteers
     for assignment.
     1.3.3. To create the transaction that causes the Overseas Duty Selection Date (ODSD) and
     Short Tour Return Date (STRD) to be adjusted for each day spent on Temporary Duty (TDY)
     in an overseas area.
     1.3.4. To manage PERSTEMPO and to determine the Operation Tempo (OPSTEMPO) of
     wings, units, weapons systems, and Air Force Specialty’s (AFSs). Strength accounting duty
     status updates trigger the transaction that creates a record within the TDY history. This
     transaction is used in the management of PERSTEMPO and has a direct impact on unit and
     individual credit for deployment. Senior leaders use the SADSP data to help gauge the
     effects continual TDYs have on unit readiness and individual quality of life.
     1.3.5. To change service dates, pay dates, military pay, lost time, retirement and separation
     dates, dates of rank, ODSDs, STRDs, promotion eligibility, and reenlistment eligibility when
     a member is placed into a unfavorable code: confinement, absence without leave (AWOL),
     deserter, etc.

  1.3.6. To comply with DoD requirements to provide the Defense Manpower Data Center
  (DMDC) information on all TDYs performed. DMDC uses Service-supplied data to report
  PERSTEMPO to the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. This data
  informs the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) which Services are the busiest in terms
  of time away from home station.
  1.3.7. To calculate unit personnel Category levels, or C-levels in Status of Resources and
  Training Systems (SORTS).
  1.3.8. To identify the availability of personnel to meet combatant commander requirements.
  1.3.9. To identify personnel who are projected to deploy or already deployed to support
  combatant commander requirements.

                                            Chapter 3

    REPORTING CHANGES IN STRENGTH ACCOUNTING DUTY STATUS FOR
    CONFINEMENT, ABSENCE WITHOUT LEAVE (AWOL), DESERTION, AND
                     APPELLATE REVIEW LEAVE

3.1. Purpose. Changes in strength accounting duty status must be updated as they occur. The
DD Form 2707, Confinement Order, is the source document to initiate the strength accounting
duty status via CMS, to change the member’s strength accounting duty status to a military
confinement strength accounting duty status. See Personnel Service Delivery Duty Status
Procedures for CMS Updates Training Tool Guide located on AFPC website.
3.2. Background. This chapter provides information on Confinement, AWOL, and Deserter
Status. Confinement, AWOL, and deserter strength accounting duty status conditions may result
in lost time. It details procedures for the capture and reporting of these strength accounting duty
status conditions. NOTE: Air Force Missing Persons Branch (AFPC/DPWCM) will update
strength accounting duty status in MilPDS for AWOL, Deserter and civilian/military
confinement as a result of AWOL/Deserter strength accounting duty status.
3.3. Confinement, AWOL, and Deserter strength accounting duty status Procedures.
   3.3.1. Confinement. Confinement strength accounting duty status is reported IAW AFI 31-
   205, the Air Force Corrections System, and DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume
   7A.
       3.3.1.1. Notify appropriate agency of strength accounting duty status Codes 04, 05, 16,
       17, 56, or 59, as applicable, when a member has been confined for 24 hours or more.
       3.3.1.2. When a member is confined by civil authorities or under arrest, pending trial,
       awaiting sentencing, or out of jail on bond and restricted to the state while on approved
       leave, the member may continue on leave until the original expiration date of leave unless
       recalled to duty by the commander IAW AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. If still
       confined after expiration of leave, the member’s strength accounting duty status must be
       updated to a civilian confinement code of 04, 05, or 56 effective the day after the leave
       expiration date. (NOTE: If a member is placed into pre-trial confinement while under
       civilian control either under arrest, pending trial, awaiting sentencing, or out of jail on
       bond while restricted to the state and is then sentenced to confinement, a new AF Form
       2098 and/or CMS case must be completed to change the member’s strength accounting
       duty status from 04 to 05 or 56. When a member is sentenced to civil confinement, the
       length of confinement determines if the member will be dropped from unit manning. If
       the sentence is for 6 months or more, whether by foreign or U.S. civil court, member
       should drop from unit manning. If the sentence is less than 6 months, member will
       remain on the unit manning roster.) (See Attachment 7).
       3.3.1.3. When a member is placed into military confinement, either pre-trial or as the
       result of a court-martial sentence (strength accounting duty status Codes 16, 17, or 59),
       the unit commander must sign a DD Form 2707, provided by the local confinement
       officer. The confinement order is the source document used to initiate the AF Form 2098
       and/or CMS case. (NOTE: If a member is put into pre-trial confinement and is then
       sentenced by court-martial to confinement, a new confinement order will be published
14                                                           AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014


     and a new AF Form 2098 and/or CMS must be completed to change the strength
     accounting duty status from 16 to 17 or 59).
     3.3.1.4. If the accused was in continuous pre-trial confinement from the confinement
     date until the adjudgment date, an AF Form 1359, Report of Result of Trial, can serve in
     lieu of the confinement order.
     3.3.1.5. Court-Martial Sentences With Less Than 12 Months of Confinement Time IAW
     AFI 31-205:
        3.3.1.5.1. For court-martial sentences with less than 12 months of confinement time,
        the member may serve all or part of his/her confinement locally. Any reduction in
        grade due to the court-martial requires coordination with the appropriate AFPC,
        ARPC and NGB promotions office. An AF IMT 1359, Report of Result of Trial, will
        be published, listing all the charges and findings of each charge, to include the
        sentence. If a sentence includes a punitive discharge, the MPS Personnel Relocations
        Element will update a request for separation in MilPDS. The requested separation
        date will be “08-Aug-3888” and the RET-SEP-ID will be “S” with the appropriate
        Separation Designator (SPD) Code.
        3.3.1.5.2. When a member’s sentence is less than 12 months and the local
        confinement facility cannot accommodate the member or the Convening Authority
        (CA) has not acted on the case, the member may be transferred by Permanent Change
        of Station (PCS) without Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) to a regional
        corrections facility managed by the HQ Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ
        AFSFC), Lackland AFB, Texas (DSN 945-5608/5616). If the CA has acted on the
        case, the member will then be PCSd with PCA, and HQ AFSFC/SFC will force gain
        the member and assume administrative control. When an officer is court-martialed,
        the confinement will be served at the United States Disciplinary Barracks, Fort
        Leavenworth, Kansas, unless dictated otherwise.
     3.3.1.6. Court-Martial Sentences With 12 Months or More Confinement Time IAW AFI
     31-205, The Air Force Corrections System. HQ AFSFC will normally assign the
     member PCS with PCA to a DoD regional correctional facility once the CA acts on the
     case. The member will be physically transferred and administratively assigned to HQ
     AFSFC. The local confinement officer will send a message to HQ AFSFC requesting
     transfer of the member. HQ AFSFC will respond by message with further transfer
     instructions and assignment procedures to the local MPS and the gaining correctional
     facility. Prior to a member being transferred to a DoD regional correctional facility,
     ensure his/her strength accounting duty status is updated to 17 (Sentenced Military
     Prisoner). NOTE: Any reduction in grade due to the court-martial requires coordination
     with the appropriate AFPC, ARPC and NGB promotions office.
     3.3.1.7. When updating strength accounting duty status Code 05 (Civilian Confinement,
     Sentenced Prisoner) or 17 (Military Confinement, Sentenced Prisoner), ensure the
     expiration date is correct. If a member receives a sentence of 5 years confinement, the
     strength accounting duty status expiration date should reflect a date 5 years from the
     adjudgment date--the expiration date may change based upon the member’s ultimate
     release date.
AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                     15


     3.3.1.8. For strength accounting duty status Codes 04 (Civilian, Pre-Trial Confinement)
     and 16 (Military, Pre-Trial Confinement), the system automatically suspenses strength
     accounting duty status expiration for 30 days from the effective date. A Transaction
     Register (TR) notice will be produced prior to the expiration date. This can be extended
     in 15-day increments. If the strength accounting duty status code remains expired for
     more than 15 days, the system will not allow further updates. The member will have to
     be brought back to strength accounting duty status Code 00 and a lost time update of zero
     days must be entered. Update the member again into the appropriate strength accounting
     duty status code with the original effective date and a future expiration date 15 days from
     the date of this latest update.
     3.3.1.9. When going from one unfavorable strength accounting duty status code to
     another, for example strength accounting duty status Code 16 (Pre-Trial Confinement) to
     strength accounting duty status Code 17 (Military Confinement, Sentenced Prisoner), do
     not bring the member back to strength accounting duty status Code 00 (PFD). If brought
     back to strength accounting duty status Code 00, a lost time update will have to be done.
  3.3.2. Absent without Leave (AWOL). AWOL strength accounting duty status is reported
  IAW AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence.
     3.3.2.1. For a member to be placed into an AWOL strength accounting duty status, the
     member must be in an unauthorized absence status for more than 24 hours. An
     unauthorized absence begins when a member is absent from where they are ordered or
     otherwise required to be present. For an unauthorized absence of more than 24 hours and
     less than 30 days, classify as AWOL or Deserter (See paragraph 3.3.3 for the Deserter
     process).
     3.3.2.2. When updating AWOL or deserter strength accounting duty status Code 07, the
     strength accounting duty status expiration date is automatically projected to 30 days from
     the effective date.
     3.3.2.3. On the 31st day of AWOL, a TR remark will be generated stating the member
     has been AWOL for 30 days or more, verifying the status and updating the appropriate
     strength accounting duty status code. A new AF Form 2098 and/or CMS must be
     accomplished when going from strength accounting duty status Code 07 (AWOL) to
     strength accounting duty status Code 06 (Deserter).
  3.3.3. Deserter. Deserter strength accounting duty status is reported IAW AFI 36-2911,
  Desertion and Unauthorized Absence. A member does not have to be placed in AWOL
  status prior to being declared a deserter. Commanders should place members in deserter
  status if the member is AWOL for any amount of time and meets any of the following
  criteria:
     3.3.3.1. Is under duty or travel restrictions imposed by DoDI 5200.02/AFI 31-501,
     Personnel Security Program Management.
     3.3.3.2. Has had access within the past 12 months to Top Secret information or other
     classified information that requires special access authority (see AFI 36-2911, table 1,
     paragraph 1.5.2.2.). DO NOT classify a person who appears to be more a casualty than a
     deserter solely because the person has had access to classified material described herein.
 16                                                              AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014


      3.3.3.3. Has gone to or stayed in a foreign country and, while there, has asked for or
      taken any type of asylum or resident permit from that country or its governmental
      agencies.
      3.3.3.4. Has a previous unauthorized absence pending that has not been completed.
      3.3.3.5. Is an escaped prisoner.
      3.3.3.6. Is under investigation for violating articles of the Uniformed Code of Military
      Justice (UCMJ) as specified in AFI 36-2911, attachment 4, or against whom charges for
      any offense have been referred to a General Court-Martial.
      3.3.3.7. Is determined by HQ AFPC/DPWCM to be in a deserter status.
      3.3.3.8. Goes or remains absent from his/her unit, organization, or place of duty with the
      intent to remain away permanently.
      3.3.3.9. When updating deserter strength accounting duty status Code 06, the strength
      accounting duty status expiration date is automatically projected to 179 days from the
      effective date.
      3.3.3.10. An unauthorized absence ends when the absentee or deserter returns to military
      control. AFPC/DPWCM will update MilPDS with a strength accounting duty status code
      returning the member to military control IAW AFI 36-2911.
      3.3.3.11. Correctional custody is non-judicial punishment commanders can impose for
      minor offenses. Correctional custody is not confinement and time served in correctional
      custody is not lost time. The strength accounting duty status code for a member placed in
      correctional custody will be 00 (PFD). For those installations that do not have a
      correctional custody facility and member will be placed into one at another installation,
      place the member in strength accounting duty status Code 14 (Not PFD - Other).
3.4. Lost Time.
   3.4.1. Definition. Any time a member (enlisted or officer) spends in AWOL status,
   desertion, or any confinement whether it is pre or post-trial confinement status is considered
   non-creditable service--also referred to as lost time or “bad" time. When lost time is charged,
   a member’s service dates are adjusted forward by the number of days of lost time charged.
   3.4.1.1. Time spent in confinement is considered to be non-creditable service and must be
   charged as lost time (DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A, table 1.1. and 10
   USC § 972). EXCEPTION: If the member is released without trial, acquitted, or the
   conviction is set aside on legal grounds, please contact the Total Force Service Center
   (AFPC/DPTSO) at DSN 665-5000.
      3.4.1.2. Do not return a member to strength accounting duty status Code 00 when going
      from one unfavorable strength accounting duty status to another (e.g., Pretrial
      Confinement to Sentenced Prisoner).
      3.4.1.3. Enlisted members can only be charged lost time for the period of their
      enlistment. (e.g., if a member has 2 years left on a 4-year enlistment when they go
      AWOL and are apprehended 4 years later, they can only be charged lost time for the 2
      years they had remaining on their enlistment).
AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                    17


     3.4.1.4. When calculating lost time, the day a member enters into a unfavorable strength
     accounting duty status, regardless of the hour, is considered unfavorable. The day a
     member is returned to a “good” strength accounting duty status, regardless of the hour, is
     considered “good.”
  3.4.2. Updating Lost Time:
     3.4.2.1. MilPDS will automatically generate a lost time update to the lost time
     application, only when the member is returned to a present for strength accounting duty
     status. The completion of an AF IMT 2098 and/or a CMS case with the appropriate
     signatures is required for members returning from a unfavorable strength accounting duty
     status (see Attachment 5). The number of days lost time is determined by the from and
     thru dates. MilPDS will not count the day an individual is returned to duty or military
     control as lost time.
         3.4.2.1.1. The same day lost time has been updated in MilPDS, TR notices will be
         generated and a Service Date Adjustment Report Individual Person (RIP) will be
         produced, showing the member’s old service dates as well as the new adjusted ones.
         This RIP must be filed in the member’s Automated Records Management System
         (ARMS) along with applicable AF Form 2098 and/or CMS file. The RIP will serve
         as the source document for the new service dates as it will be needed if any
         corrections to the lost time update need to be made. The service dates listed below
         are automatically adjusted with a lost time update and reported to Defense Finance
         and Accounting Service (DFAS) and MilPDS:
            3.4.2.1.1.1. Pay Date.
            3.4.2.1.1.2. Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD).
            3.4.2.1.1.3. Total Enlisted Military Service Date (TEMSD).
            3.4.2.1.1.4. Date of Separation (DOS).
            3.4.2.1.1.5. Expiration Term of Service (ETS).
            3.4.2.1.1.6. Grade Current Date of Rank (DOR).
            3.4.2.1.1.7. Overseas Duty Selection Date (ODSD).
            3.4.2.1.1.8. Short Tour Return Date (STRD).
            3.4.2.1.1.9. Lost Days Current Enlistment.
            3.4.2.1.1.10. Absent Days After ETS.
            3.4.2.1.1.11. Active Duty Service Commitment Date (ADSCD).
            3.4.2.1.1.12. Since MilPDS automatically adjusts lost time once a member is
            returned PFD, for any unauthorized absence (AWOL or Desertion), if the unit
            commander has not made a determination once he/she has investigated the
            circumstances involving the member’s absence and determines the cause, a lost
            time determination must be made. If the commander decides to not charge the
            member lost time, delete the lost time from the lost time application in MilPDS.

3.5. Officer Strength Accounting Duty Status Procedures:
   3.5.1. Officer lost time procedures apply to all RegAF officers, Reserve and ANG officers
   on extended active duty tours (Title 10). The 1996 Defense Authorization Act amendments
   changed the law concerning lost time for officers. United States Code, Title 10, Section 972
   states: “An officer who after February 10, 1996, deserts, is absent from his organization,
   station or place of duty for more than one day without proper authority, is confined by
   military or civilian authorities for more than one day, or in connection with a trial, whether
   before, during, or after the trial or is unable to perform duties because of intemperate use of
   drugs or alcohol because of disease or injury resulting from misconduct as determined by
   competent authority, will not receive service credit for lost time. However, the lost time will
   not affect the officer’s basic pay for years of service under Section 205 of Title 37.”
   3.5.2. Generally, documentation of lost time is done electronically. Currently MilPDS does
   not allow for a lost time update to be made on an officer. Therefore, compliance with the
   guidance is mandatory.
   3.5.3. Placing an Officer into Military/Civilian Confinement, Deserter, AWOL, strength
   accounting duty status (04, 05, 06, 07, 16, 17, 52, 56, 59):
      3.5.3.1. For RegAF Members: The original AF Form 2098 and/or CMS case will be
      loaded into ARMS upon completion of CMS case.
      3.5.3.2. For Unit Reserve, Unit AGR, and ANG Members: The original AF Form 2098
      and/or CMS will be processed by the Reserve/ANG MPS and forwarded with proper
      coordination as outlined in attachment 5 to ARPC Contact Center through the Virtual
      Personnel Center-Guard Reserve (vPC-GR Online) (for Air National Guard of the United
      States (ANGUS) members) and the Personnel Employment Branch, AFRC/DPMF, 155
      Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 (for USAFR members).
      3.5.3.3. For IMA and HQ AGR Members: The original AF Form 2098 and/or CMS will
      be processed by the active duty unit SADSP manager or MPS as outlined in attachment 5
      and forwarded with proper coordination to ARPC Contact Center through the Virtual
      Personnel Center-Guard Reserve (vPC-GR Online) (for Air National Guard of the United
      States (ANGUS) members) and the Personnel Employment Branch, AFRC/DPMF, 155
      Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 (for USAFR members).
      3.5.3.4. For USAFA Cadets: The original AF Form 2098 and/or CMS will be processed
      by the active duty unit SADSP manager or MPS and forwarded to AFPC/DPWCM or
      DPTSO as appropriate.
   3.5.4. To Return an Officer to Present for strength accounting duty status (Code 00):
      3.5.4.1. A second original AF Form 2098 and/or CMS will be accomplished. This new
      form will be processed by the MPS with proper coordination and must contain a lost time
      determination made by the unit commander, as outlined in attachment 5. Forward the
      completed form to AFPC/DPSIPV. AFPC/DPSIPV will update the TAFSMD, Total
      Active Federal Commissioned Service Date (TAFCSD), and adjust ADSC (if necessary)
      to reflect the number of lost days and will adjust 10 USC § 1405 Service Date. For lost
      time purposes, the 1405 service date will only be computed if the individual is at the 18-
AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                       19


      year mark. HQ AFPC/DPSIPV will also forward the AF Form 2098 to AFPC/DPAPP1
      for adjustment of ODSD and STRD.
      3.5.4.2. Once adjustments have been made, AFPC/DPSIPV will forward the original AF
      Form 2098 and/or CMS to AFPC/DPSIR.
      3.5.4.3. For Unit Reserve, Unit AGR, and ANG Members: The Reserve MPS must
      complete the AF Form 2098 and/or CMS as outlined in attachment 5, and forward it to
      ARPC Contact Center through the vPC-GR Online (for ANGUS members) and the
      Personnel Employment Branch, Air Force Reserve Command, HQ AFRC/DPMF, 155
      Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 (for USAFR members).
      3.5.4.4. For IMA and HQ AGR Reserve members serviced by an active duty unit or
      MPS, the AF Form 2098 and/or CMS must be completed as outlined in attachment 5, and
      forwarded to Military Personnel Division, Air National Guard, NGB/A1PR, 3500 Fetchet
      Avenue, Joint Base Andrews MD20762 (for ANGUS members) and the Personnel
      Employment Branch, Air Force Reserve Command, HQ AFRC/DPMF, 155 Richard Ray
      Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 (for USAFR members).
3.6. Return to Military Control:
   3.6.1. Every effort should be made to update strength accounting duty status changes when
   they occur. When a member’s strength accounting duty status changes to other than PFD to
   military or civilian confinement and returns back to PFD before any updates have been
   accomplished, do not update the system with the past strength accounting duty status, DO
   update the lost time application to reflect the applicable amount of days lost, the application
   will not automatically update because a strength accounting duty status update was not
   completed. If the strength accounting duty status change should be AWOL or Desertion,
   please contact AFPC/DPWCM for instructions. Ensure all applicable AF IMT 2098 and/or
   CMS cases are accomplished, coordinated on and properly distributed in accordance with
   this AFI.
   3.6.2. Return of a Member from AWOL, Desertion, or Confinement Status After ETS (IAW
   DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A):
      3.6.2.1. A member who is in an AWOL or deserter status and surrenders or is
      apprehended after the ETS has expired is NOT entitled to pay and allowances until
      restored to full strength accounting duty status (PFD) for the purpose of making good the
      lost time.
      3.6.2.2. The following applies if a situation warrants a member’s expired ETS to be
      made current:
          3.6.2.2.1. When a member is returned to duty from AWOL, deserter or confinement
          status, the ETS/DOS has expired, and court-martial actions are pending, the
          ETS/DOS can be involuntarily extended in 3-month increments.
          3.6.2.2.2. When a member is returned to duty from AWOL, deserter or confinement
          status, the ETS/DOS has expired and no court-martial actions are pending, there are
          two ways the ETS/DOS can be extended depending on the situation.
              3.6.2.2.2.1. If the amount of lost time to be updated would extend the member’s
              current ETS/DOS into the future, update the lost time in MilPDS.
 20                                                              AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014


              3.6.2.2.2.2. If the amount of lost time to be updated would not extend the
              member’s ETS/DOS into the future, the ETS/DOS can be extended from the date
              the member is returned to duty by the amount of lost time incurred to date. For
              example, a member enlists for 4 years on 1 Jan 90. On 1 Jan 92, the member goes
              AWOL and is apprehended by military authorities on 1 Jan 97, and placed into
              pre-trial confinement. Update MilPDS to adjust the member’s ETS/DOS and
              other service dates by the amount of time left on the member’s enlistment prior to
              going AWOL. In this case, 2 years forward from 1 Jan 97; the member’s new
              ETS/DOS would be 31 Dec 99. Ensure all applicable AF Forms 2098 and/or
              CMS are accomplished and filed. NOTE: When the ETS/DOS is extended this
              way, do not update the lost time in MilPDS. Ensure the member’s DD Form 214,
              Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty, is annotated with correct
              lost time and service dates.
3.7. Appellate Review Leave:
   3.7.1. After a member’s court-martial or confinement has been completed, and if part of the
   sentence included a dismissal or punitive discharge and the legal reviews on the case have
   not yet been finalized, the member will then be put on appellate review leave to await legal
   review results. Appellate review leave is directed by the convening authority (CA) in writing
   and will be included in the initial court-martial order. While on appellate review leave, a
   member will use up accrued leave before entering into an excess leave status, at which time
   the member is still considered to be in the Air Force, but in a no-pay status. An excess leave
   status will begin the day after accrued leave ends.
   3.7.2. If a member was transferred to a DoD regional correctional facility and was assigned
   PCS with PCA, HQ AFSFC will accomplish all appellate review actions.
   3.7.3. If a member’s confinement has been completed and the initial court-martial order
   directing appellate review has not been published, the member will be returned to his/her
   original unit or a transition flight until the court-martial order directing appellate review
   leave is received. The member’s strength accounting duty status Code will be 00.
   3.7.4. Until the member departs the base on appellate review leave, the strength accounting
   duty status Code will be 00 to include any time spent out-processing. The strength
   accounting duty status code update for appellate review is a programmatic update from
   DFAS. For this update to process, the member must be in strength accounting duty status
   Code 00.
   3.7.5. Appellate Review Leave Processing Procedures (Member Assigned Within the
   Continental United States [CONUS]):
      3.7.5.1. Losing MPS: Upon completion of a court-martial, AF IMT 1359 will be filled
      out listing all the charges and the findings of each charge to include the sentence. If the
      sentence includes a punitive discharge, the Separations Office will update a request for
      separation in MilPDS. The requested separation will be “08-Aug-3888” and the RET-
      SEP-ID will be “S” with appropriate Separation Designator (SPD) Code.
      3.7.5.2. Once the court-martial order has been published by Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)
      directing a member on appellate review leave, the member must out-process through all
      applicable base agencies. All separation actions IAW AFI 36-2102, Base Level
AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                     21


     Relocation Procedures, will be completed. DD Form 214, and AF Form 100, Request
     and Authorization for Separation, will not be completed until the final court-martial order
     is received.
        3.7.5.2.1. Losing Unit: The member’s unit will accomplish an AF Form 988, Leave
        Request/Authorization Form, with an expiration date of 300 days from the effective
        date. An AF Form 988 used for appellate review leave will be processed differently
        from a normal leave form; contact the local finance office for specific procedures, as
        a member being placed on appellate review leave has several options concerning
        leave and pay. Ensure the local finance office counsels the member concerning these
        options.
        3.7.5.2.2. Losing Comptroller Office: The losing Comptroller office will process the
        AF Form 988, in turn flowing a transaction to the base-level MilPDS updating the
        member’s strength accounting duty status Code to 52 (Appellate Review).
     3.7.5.3. Losing MPS: When the member’s strength accounting duty status Code changes
     to 52, the member’s record status will change from 10 to 82. Close coordination with the
     local Comptroller office is crucial at this point. The Comptroller office records the exact
     day a member will enter into excess leave (strength accounting duty status Code 52);
     therefore, confirm this date with Comptroller office. If more than 5 days elapse from the
     date given by the Comptroller Office, and the member’s strength accounting duty status
     Code has not changed to 52 and the current strength accounting duty status Code is 00,
     update the member’s strength accounting duty status Code manually in MilPDS to 52
     with an expiration date of 300 days from the start date.
        3.7.5.3.1. The Losing MPS will maintain a file copy of any supporting documents
        until the final court-martial order is received from the CA stating disposition of the
        member’s case. NOTE: Legal review can take from 1 – 3 years to complete.
        Member’s case should be reviewed with Legal every 300 days to see if the member’s
        case has been completed. IF NOT, the member’s expiration date in MilPDS will need
        to be extended out another 300 days; a new AF IMT 988 will be needed as a source
        document to extend member’s appellate review leave out for an additional 300 days.
        The member’s home base remains administratively responsible regardless of the
        member’s leave address. DO NOT assign the member PCS to the base closest to the
        leave address. Upon receipt of the final court-martial order approving the members
        discharge, the Separations Office will confirm the member’s separation in MilPDS
        and DFAS files. Dispose of the case file in accordance with Air Force Manual
        (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records
        Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information
        Management System (AFRIMS) and AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records
        System, table A6.4.
  3.7.6. Appellate Review Leave Processing Procedures (Member Assigned Overseas):
     3.7.6.1. Losing MPS: Upon completion of a court-martial, an AF IMT 1359 will be
     published. Use the AF IMT 1359 as the source document, and if the sentence includes a
     punitive discharge, the Separations Office will update a request for separation in MilPDS.
     The requested separation date will be “08-Aug-3888” and the RET-SEP-ID will be “S”
     with appropriate Separation Designator (SPD) Code. On receipt of the published court-
22                                                            AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014


     martial order directing a member to be placed on appellate review leave, the MPS sends a
     message requesting assignment instructions: For enlisted assignment instructions, the
     message will be sent to AFPC/DPAA; For officer assignment instructions, the message
     will be sent to AFPC/DPAPP2. Information addressees will include the losing
     MAJCOM and AFLOA/JAJM, JB Andrews, MD. In the message, include the member’s
     full name, grade, SSN, Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC), Primary Air Force
     Specialty Code (PAFSC), Date Eligible to Return from Overseas (DEROS), Assigned
     Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Code, complete leave address, home of record
     (HOR), type of discharge, court-martial order number including the date, and the date the
     member’s confinement will be completed. AFPC/DPAA will respond by return message
     only (you will not receive an in-system assignment notification). The member will be
     assigned to the MPS closest to the member’s leave address. Upon receipt of instructions
     from AFPC, schedule member for out-processing as soon as possible. Any member
     placed on appellate review leave does not report to gaining unit. Mail the military
     member’s records to the gaining unit along with AF IMT 988 completed by the member’s
     losing unit, including leave number and showing a period of 300 days. Upon arrival at
     the appellate review leave address, the member will mail a completed travel voucher, DD
     Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, to the gaining Comptroller office. The
     record remains on the overseas location file until the member is placed into excess leave
     status by the losing Comptroller office.
     3.7.6.2. Losing Comptroller office: Accomplish notification of required excess leave
     and endorsements before the member departs the overseas base, but not until after the
     member enters into an excess leave status IAW DFAS-DEM 7073-2, Unit Leave
     Procedures, paragraph C7.11.2.5. The losing Comptroller office processes the AF Form
     988, in turn flowing a transaction to MilPDS updating the member’s strength accounting
     duty status to “52” (Appellate Review Leave).
     3.7.6.3. Losing MPS: After processing AF IMT 988, close coordination with your local
     Comptroller office is crucial. Finance records the exact day a member will enter into
     excess leave status; confirm this date with the Comptroller office. If more than 5 days
     elapse from the date given by the Comptroller office, and the member’s strength
     accounting duty status Code has not changed to “52,” and the current strength accounting
     duty status Code is “00,” update the member’s strength accounting duty status Code
     manually in MilPDS to “52” with an expiration date of 300 days from the start date.
     3.7.6.4. Gaining MPS: The gaining Separations Office only maintains the case file until
     legal review is completed. The gaining MPS does not force gain the person to file. The
     member’s record remains in MilPDS until notification the appellate review case is
     complete. NOTE: Legal review can take from 1-3 years to complete. Member’s case
     should have been completed. IF NOT, then the member’s expiration date in MilPDS will
     need to be extended out another 300 days, and a new AF IMT 988 will be needed as a
     source document to extend member’s appellate review out for an additional 300 days.
     After the appellate review is completed, the MPS should receive the general court martial
     order affirming the separation. The MPS will then complete the DD Form 214,
     Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. The separation date will be the
     same date the DD Form 214 is completed; only then will the Separations Office complete
     the separation action and member’s record in MilPDS be removed.
AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                  23


     3.7.6.5. Every 120 days, the local finance office will verify the member is still on
     appellate review leave and will re-update the finance system accordingly. Upon receipt
     of a RIP (generated every 90 days), Personnel Relocations/Employment will verify the
     member’s status with the unit, or base legal office. If the member is still on appellate
     review leave and the strength accounting duty status expiration date on the RIP has
     expired, extend the expiration date by 300 days.

                                           Chapter 4

      NON-CONTINGENCY TDY STRENGTH ACCOUNTING DUTY STATUS
   REPORTING PROCEDURES, MISCELLANEOUS UPDATES, AND PERSTEMPO
                   TRACKING AND MANAGEMENT

4.1. Purpose. The SADSP is the unit commander’s responsibility; it is event-oriented which
encompasses numerous and varied types of strength accounting duty status conditions.
Information in this chapter is provided to assist in the management and update of non-
contingency TDY strength accounting duty status conditions and conditions not clearly reflected
in attachment 2.
4.2. Background. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2000 requires all Services to
track, manage, and report high-deployment events. Service secretaries are directed to pay
service members high-deployment per diem of $100 a day for each day a member is deployed in
excess of 401 days out of the previous 730-day period. In addition, the Office of the Secretary of
Defense (OSD) requires commanders to report and track activities that do not count for high-
deployment per diem, but still keep members away from their homes for 24 hours or more (e.g.,
individual training, hospitalization, confinement, etc.). The primary means to track high
PERSTEMPO events is through accurate and timely strength accounting duty status reporting.
Attachment 3 provides a list of strength accounting duty status codes or events that qualify a
member for high-deployment pay; Attachment 4 provides a list of non-pay events that do not
qualify a member for high-deployment pay. Event tracking began on 1 October 2000. Note:
Effective 8 October 2001, the Deputy Secretary Defense suspended the accumulation of
deployment days for the purpose of determining eligibility for high deployment per diem until
further notice.
4.3. Non-Contingency strength accounting duty status procedures:
   4.3.1. Strength accounting duty status conditions are reported when an individual is or will
   be projected to be in a strength accounting duty status other than PFD for more than 24
   hours. Most TDY strength accounting duty status conditions are updated prior to the event
   via MilPDS. Contingency TDYs (strength accounting duty status Codes 20 or 21) are
   updated by the MPS Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) only.
   4.3.2. Members will out-process through their unit SADSP manager the duty day prior to
   departure for their temporary duty (TDY) location. An AF IMT 4334, Individual TDY
   Processing Checklist (Attachment 10) will be initiated for the member; this will not apply to
   the member processing through the IPR. The top portion of AF IMT 4334 will be kept in a
   suspense file until the member returns and completes in-processing procedures. The bottom
   portion of the form will be given to the member as a hand receipt for processing through the
   unit and it is recommended to keep with their orders. The duty day after the member returns
   to home station from the TDY location, the member must in-process though their unit to
   complete previously initiated AF IMT 4334. Please see attachment 11 and attachment 12 as
   examples of AF IMT 4334 and proper instructions on how to complete the IMT.
   4.3.3. Sick in Quarters, strength accounting duty status Code 08, will be used when a
   member has been placed in quarters by the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). If the
   expiration date is unknown, use the best estimate based on the facts available. When future
AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                      25


   hospitalization or sick in quarters information is known, project the strength accounting duty
   status by using future dates. REMINDER: The MTF updates strength accounting duty status
   Code 13, for members assigned to the hospital in patient status.
4.4. After-the-Fact strength accounting duty status updates.
   4.4.1. TDY history data is extremely important to the member and to the Air Force for
   tracking PERSTEMPO; it’s also used to determine entitlements for high-deployment pay.
   TDY history and the data used to measure PERSTEMPO are derived from strength
   accounting duty status. If, for some reason, a TDY strength accounting duty status was not
   updated via strength accounting duty status reporting and the member has subsequently
   returned from TDY, the data in his/her TDY history record must still be updated. For
   contingency TDY history updates, one of the following source documents must accompany a
   completed travel voucher to verify the validity of the deployment and a deployment in
   support of a named operation:
       4.4.1.1. Certified CED order
       4.4.1.2. Certified non-CED order (i.e., Defense Travel System (DTS) travel order, DD
       Form 1610, NATO Travel Order)
       4.4.1.3. Approved decoration
       4.4.1.4. Performance report
       4.4.1.5. Finalized letter of evaluation
       4.4.1.6. Unit commander/deployed commander (squadron level or higher) letter
       providing justification. NOTE: All source documents must identify the individual and
       state the named operation supported for the duration of the TDY. Source documents
       must also include the total inclusive period for the supported deployment, i.e., TDY
       departure date from home station, TDY arrival date in theater AOR, TDY departure date
       from the final deployed location, and TDY return date to home station. EXAMPLE: “In
       support of Operation ENDURING/IRAQI FREEDOM.” After-the-fact TDY History
       inquiries and requests should be coordinated through the member’s MPS first. For
       requests not meeting the above criteria, the IPR obtains approval from the Force Support
       Squadron (FSS) Operations Officer (FSS/OPSO) to update the TDY History. The
       FSS/OPSO has approval authority; however, AFPC/DPA or ARPC/DPA (for ARC) are
       the final disapproval authority.
4.5. Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO) and Tempo Management Tracking System
(TMTS):
   4.5.1. TMTS was developed to track all Air Force PERSTEMPO events. It is a total force
   web-based application that displays all events reported through strength accounting duty
   status updates and travel vouchers sent by finance offices. This tracking system has the
   capability to pinpoint individuals who accumulate high-deployment management/pay
   thresholds. TMTS also allows MPSs and units to add, update, and delete events that were or
   weren’t captured by a strength accounting duty status update. Strength accounting duty
   status updates are imperative to the success of tracking events through TMTS and key to
   helping commanders comply with Burdensome Tempo management policies. Without the
   initial update from the personnel community, commanders at all levels have no way to
 26                                                              AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014


   monitor the availability of their personnel. In addition, without these updates, TMTS
   becomes an historical database instead of a real-time monitoring tool. TMTS displays all
   TDY related events to include contingency deployment TDYs, (strength accounting duty
   status Codes 20 and 21); only non-contingency deployment TDYs can be updated, corrected,
   or deleted by using TMTS. Contingency deployment TDYs can only be updated by FSS/IPR
   personnel through DCAPES and MilPDS. Every person of every component of the USAF
   can view their own TDY history in TMTS by visiting the AFPC secure web-site at
   https://w20.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFPCSecureNet20/PKI/MainMenu1.aspx
   4.5.2. Special TMTS access can be granted to commanders, strength accounting duty status
   managers, MAJCOMs, etc., on a case-by-case basis by e-mailing the AFPC/DPWORS inbox
   at afpc.perstempo@randolph.af.mil. Special access is usually reserved for personnel,
   whose duties include verifying, tracking, updating, correcting, and deleting TDY events in
   TMTS that don’t have access to MilPDS. Three different types of special access are
   available. They are: Unit level access (View and Update) capability; MPS level access
   (View and Update) capability; and Command level access (View/Inquiry Only) capability.
   When submitting requests for special access users must supply their: full name, SSAN,
   access level required, unit(s) PASCODE(s) required or MPS/MAJCOM ID, and a brief
   explanation/justification of duties required for TMTS access support.
4.6. Leave in Conjuction with Another Strength Accounting Duty Status:
   4.6.1. Leave in Conjunction with a Routine TDY. Adjust the start date and/or number of
   days if a member was projected for a TDY of which the leave will be taken outside the local
   area at the beginning or end of the TDY. If leave is to be taken within the local area, follow
   procedures outlined in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program.
   4.6.2. Leave in Conjunction with a Contingency TDY. IPR will follow appropriate
   combatant commander guidance for processing leave in conjunction with a contingency
   TDY. If leave will be taken within the local area prior to deployment, follow procedures
   outlined in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. If leave is taken within the local area
   upon completion of the deployment, follow procedures outlined by individual MAJCOMs in
   Post Deployment Stand-down Policy.
   4.6.3. Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) and In-Place COT (IPCOT) leave. Personnel who
   do not use COT leave during their permanent change of station must use this leave within 1
   year. A DD Form 1610, Administrative Order, is used to facilitate this process. Unlike
   ordinary leave, when an AF Form 988 is processed by the local financial service office
   (FSO), COT leave is not processed by the local FSO until after the leave has been taken.
   This creates a situation where the member is in strength accounting duty status Code 00,
   PFD, when they are, in fact, on leave. Commanders’ support staffs will update strength
   accounting duty status Code 14, Not PFD -Other, on personnel taking COT/IPCOT leave not
   in conjunction with their PCS move. Upon return from COT/IPCOT leave and subsequent
   filing of the travel voucher, the member’s leave will be charged.
   4.6.4. Convalescent Leave. Authorized personnel going on convalescent leave for
   prescribed recuperation are not in a chargeable leave status. When an AF Form 988 is
   accomplished, units will update the member’s strength accounting duty status Code to 14.
AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                    27


  4.6.5. Emergency Leave from Overseas. Use AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for
  Emergency Leave Travel, IAW AFI 36-3003, and DFAS DEM 7073-2, Unit Leave
  Procedures, Chapter 7, for members authorized funded emergency travel. Emergency leave
  is travel-generated leave processed after the fact on an AF Form 985, Report of Travel
  Time/Leave, and accomplished by the local FSO travel section. In addition, units or MPS
  will update strength accounting duty status Code 14 in these instances to maintain
  accountability.
  4.6.6. Not PFD at Home Station (strength accounting duty status Code 14). For personnel
  attending professional military education (PME), performing resource augmentation
  (READY) or correctional custody duty, on a contingency pass (days off as a result of a
  deployment), or another event which makes a person not PFD within their assigned unit at
  their home station, update strength accounting duty status Code 14. Strength accounting duty
  status Code 14 does not impact the TDY history or accumulator files and is not counted
  towards high-deployment pay. NOTE: Strength accounting duty status Code 14 should only
  be updated as a current change in the person’s strength accounting duty status and not
  projected. If strength accounting duty status Code 14 is projected, it will not consummate on
  the effective date.
 28                                                              AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014


                                           Chapter 5

                  DUTY STATUS EFFECTIVENESS REPORT (DSERT)

5.1. Purpose. The DSERT was created as a report card for wing commanders to show the
effectiveness of their individual TDY SADSP, derived from information contained within the
TDY Assignments area, TDY History File. The DSERT file serves as a tool to assist
commanders in assessing the effectiveness of their TDY strength accounting duty status
reporting procedures.
5.2. Background. The DSERT file provides overall MAJCOM and wing (MPS ID)
commander’s statistics on how well strength accounting duty status changes are being reported
for their organizations. The report will show the total number of records in the TDY
Assignments area, TDY History application in MilPDS for the reporting period, total number of
records received via a strength accounting duty status update and a strength accounting duty
status percentage.
5.3. Production and Distribution. The DSERT is produced on a monthly basis from
DISCOVERER by the base-level Personnel Systems Manager (PSM) and forwarded to unit
commanders and unit strength accounting duty status managers. Information used to create the
DSERT is broken down into a detailed report containing name, individual unit percentages and
TDY Types by unit. This will be sent to the MPS flight chief who is required to break out and
distribute this information to appropriate units.
   5.3.1. Data Capture. The TDY Assignments, TDY History File receives its information
   from DFAS interface as a result of a completed travel voucher or a strength accounting duty
   status projection/update through MilPDS. The DSERT is based on the assumption people
   will file a travel voucher at the completion of their TDY. With this assumption, statistics are
   developed to indicate the effectiveness of TDY strength accounting duty status reporting.
   5.3.2. Statistics. Statistical analysis is possible because we receive records in TDY History
   via our DFAS interface, thus providing a baseline to determine if corresponding strength
   accounting duty status updates were made. Statistics are developed based on the total
   number of TDY records compared to those records that do not contain a strength accounting
   duty status update.

Terms
Duty Status— As defined in U.S.C. Title 10 as: (1) The term "active duty" means full-time duty
in the active military service of the United States. Such term includes full-time training duty,
annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service, at a school designated
as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military department concerned. Such term
does not include full-time National Guard duty. (2) The term "active duty for a period of more
than 30 days" means active duty under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or
less. (3) The term "active service" means service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty.
AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                       33


(4) The term "active status" means the status of a member of a reserve component who is
not in the inactive Army National Guard or inactive Air National Guard, on an inactive
status list, or in the Retired Reserve. (5) The term "full—time National Guard duty" means
training or other duty, other than inactive duty, performed by a member of the Army National
Guard of the United States or the Air National Guard of the United States in the member's status
as a member of the National Guard of a State or territory, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or
the District of Columbia under section 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of title 32 for which the
member is entitled to pay from the United States or for which the member has waived pay from
the United States.
(6)(A) The term "active Guard and Reserve duty" means active duty performed by a
member of a reserve component of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, or full—
time National Guard duty performed by a member of the National Guard pursuant to an order to
full-time National Guard duty, for a period of 180 consecutive days or more for the purpose of
organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the reserve components.
Contingency— Joint Pub 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military Terms, defines a contingency as an
emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or
required military operations. This includes any duty in a declared war, hostile fire or imminent
danger zone, a peacekeeping or humanitarian operation, or rotational TDY operations.
Exercise— A military maneuver or simulated wartime operation involving planning, preparation
and execution; it is accomplished for the purpose of training and evaluation. It maybe a
multinational, Joint, Other Government Agencies (OGA) support, or a single-Service exercise;
depending on participating organizations.
Deployment— For personnel accountability and individual deployment credit any
contingency/deployment TDY away from the home station that fills a validated combatant,
component commander or supported major command (MAJCOM) requirement for forces in
support of a named operation or exercise. AFI 36-2134, Attachment 2, lists strength accounting
duty status Code 20 as a “TDY Contingency, Rotational, Exercise,” and is used to show the
deployment of an individual in support of a Plan Identification (PID) named operation. This
strength accounting duty status is updated by a daily system interface between DCAPES and
MilPDS.
Strength Accounting Duty Status— Term used to replace duty status as it applies to when an
individual is projected to be or is in a strength accounting duty status condition other than PFD,
as well as when he/she is subsequently returned to PFD.

                   PREPARATION OF AF IMT 2098, DUTY STATUS CHANGE

Table A5.1. Preparation of AF IMT 2098, Duty Status Change.
Rule   If preparing         Then

1      Address Element      “TO” The servicing MPS. “FROM” The organization reporting the strength accounting duty status
                            change

2      Section I            Enter member’s last name, first name, middle initial, Sr., etc., grade, SSN

3      Section II           Enter the member’s strength accounting duty status change code (see Attachment 2) “From” & “To”.

                            Enter the “Effective date” and “Hour” of when the event took place.

                            For example: (Date) 13 Feb 2003, (Hour) 13:59.

                            NOTE: The day a member enters into a unfavorable strength accounting duty status is considered a
                            bad day and is the first day of chargeable lost time. The day a member is released or returns from a
                            unfavorable strength accounting duty status regardless of the time is considered a good day and is not
                            counted as lost time (note 1).

                            The “Location” block will reflect the location of the member when the member is entered into the new
                            strength accounting duty status code. For example: A member goes from PFD to AWOL while they
                            are assigned to Randolph AFB TX, the location of the AWOL would reflect Randolph AFB TX. If the
                            member goes from AWOL to civil confinement in the Bexar County Jail, San Antonio TX, the
                            location would reflect Bexar County Jail, San Antonio TX. Once the member is released from civil
                            confinement and returned to PFD, the location block would reflect Randolph AFB TX.

                            AUTHORITY BLOCK: AFI 36-2134

                            Indicate the “Method of Return to Military Control” when a member returns from a unfavorable
                            strength accounting duty status – Whether it was voluntary or involuntary.
                            “Determination of Lost Time by Unit Commander” – When a member returns from an unauthorized
                            absence (i.e., AWOL, Deserter, Confinement), you will need to annotate their “Period of Absence.”
                            All periods of confinement are considered lost time by US Code, Title 10, Section 972.

                            1. Enter the date (DD/MMM/YYYY) of when the unfavorable strength accounting duty status started
                            and the last day of lost time charged. For example, Amn Jones was placed into confinement on 13 Mar
                            02 and was released on 25 Mar 02. His period of absence would be 13 Mar 02 thru 24 Mar 02, his
                            effective date for PFD would be 25 Mar 02.

                                      NOTE: The day a member enters into a unfavorable strength accounting duty status is
                            considered a bad day and is the first day of chargeable lost time. The day a member is released or
                            returns from a unfavorable strength accounting duty status is considered a good day and is not counted
                            as lost time.

                            Once you enter the period of absence you will need to mark whether the period of absence “Is” or “Is
                            Not” determined as lost time, per AFI 36-2134.

                            2. If a “Determination of Absence” cannot be made, annotate the dates of the period of absence and
                            state a brief reason why the determination could not be made.

                            3A. If the period of absence was determined as lost time, enter the consecutive amount of days in
                            “Total Lost Days This Enlistment”.

                                     NOTE: This will not always be the same as the total lost days to this incident. If the member
                            had another lost time incident while in his current enlistment you will need to add the amount of days
                            to this incident and then annotate the total in this block.

                            “Remarks”- Enter a statement relating to the circumstances reflected on the AF IMT 2098 (e.g., for a
                            member going into military confinement, state the member was court-martialed and sentenced to 8
                            months of military confinement with a bad conduct discharge).

4      Section III          The unit commander, squadron section commander, or authorized representative, as designated in
                            writing, will sign the “Squadron Commander or Designated Representative” block. (See Note 2)

                            The unit SADSP manager or designated representative will sign the “Unit SADSP Manager” block
                            and also input the date the system (MilPDS) was updated to the new strength accounting duty status
44                                                                             AFI36-2134 4 AUGUST 2014

                      code.

                              NOTE: If the unit was unable to make the update in MilPDS, the Personnel Employment
                      Office will complete the systems update block.

5      Section IV     The Personnel Employment Office will sign the “Approval By MPS SADSP Manager” block ensuring

                      distribution of the IMT. They will annotate the date, name, grade, title and signature.

                              NOTE: They will also annotate the “System Update Completed On” block if the unit was not
                      able to make the update.

                      ASSIGNMENTS: The assignments manager will coordinate in this block ensuring all assignment
