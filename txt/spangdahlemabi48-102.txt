This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 48-1, Aerospace Program. This
instruction establishes procedures for the control of pets on Spangdahlem Air Base (AB) and all
government-leased housing (GLH) areas. This instruction applies to all personnel assigned or
attached to the 52d Fighter Wing (52 FW). Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363_USAFESUP, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility using the AF 847, Recommendation for

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The Spangdahlem Veterinary Treatment Facility (VTF) has moved to a new building and does
not have the capability to confine stray animals; the VTF will now be available during business
hours to assist in the identification of stray animals; punitive fees or fees for confinement of stray
animals will be assessed and collected through the 52d Security Forces Squadron (52 SFS); fees
for veterinary services rendered by the VTF to a pet impounded as stray will be collected by the
VTF; all dogs and cats receiving services at the VTF, whether residing on or off base, will be
permanently identified with an implanted microchip; for animals involved in bite incidents, the
responsible Veterinary Corp Officer (VCO) will make a recommendation on banishment from
housing based on the animal’s temperament and history; 52 SFS will notify the installation VCO,
housing, and the Base Command of any animal that has been banished from base; the VCO may
be called upon to perform a sanitation inspection of base housing related to pet ownership; host

nation laws apply to the importation and ownership of specific breeds of dogs; pet owners will
remain in compliance with these laws; apprehension and impoundment of stray or wild animals
will be the responsibility of 52 Civil Engineering Squadron/Pest Management (52 CES/CEOIE).
1. General:
     1.1. Definitions:
        1.1.1. Pets - Typical pets include domestic dogs or cats, ferrets, aquarium fish, small
        birds, hamsters, gerbils or rabbits in cages. Any other naturally wild or barnyard animals
        are not included. Specific exceptions must be coordinated through the 52d Mission
        Support Group Commander (52 MSG/CC).
        1.1.2. On base - The term “on base” applies to Spangdahlem AB, Bitburg AB Annex,
        and all GLH areas.
     1.2. Policy:
        1.2.1. Pet ownership is a privilege and each pet owner residing on base is responsible for
        compliance with this directive. The keeping of wild animals or exotic species is
        prohibited.
        1.2.2. This instruction will be enforced by 52 SFS.
        1.2.3. Pets may not roam unrestricted on the base. Animals found running loose will be
        apprehended and impounded by 52 CES/CEOIE. In accordance with Air Force
        Instruction 48-131, Veterinary Health Services, the installation commander will
        determine the protocol for impoundment, disposal, or other physical control of privately-
        owned or stray animals on the installation. Chains or similar devices used to secure pets
        are discouraged. German policies identify immobilizing chains to be inhumane. If a lead
        or leash is used, it should be a length that will not allow the pet to have access to common
        areas (including sidewalks) and preferably will not be fixed to one stationary point. Pet
        owners who maintain their pets in a fenced area must ensure the pet cannot jump over or
        dig under the fence.
        1.2.4. Pet owners will control pet noises that annoy or offend neighbors. Two or more
        documented noise complaints against a pet may result in the pet’s banishment from base.
        Failure to comply with this provision of this instruction may result in the pet owner’s
        removal from government quarters.
        1.2.5. Pet owners will clean up their pet’s feces or vomitus in all areas.
        1.2.6. Vicious pets or trained attack dogs will not be kept on base. Pet owners will
        comply with host nation laws on importation or ownership of specific breeds or species
        of pets (e.g. dangerous dogs).
        1.2.7. Animals involved in an unprovoked bite incident may be banned from base on the
        first offense. Repeat unprovoked bite incidents will result in mandatory banishment.
        Provocation will be determined by 52 MSG/CC with input from the installation VCO.
        Banishment from base will be upon the direction of the 52 MSG/CC as delegated to 52
        SFS/CC through coordination with the installation VCO. The responsible VCO will
        make recommendations based on an animal’s temperament and history.
SPANGDAHLEMABI48-102 30 JUNE 2010                                                                 3


       1.2.8. Pet owners will not leave animals unattended in vehicles if environmental
       conditions are not suitable for the pet's wellbeing. If pets left unattended in vehicles are
       found to be in distress, an attempt will be made to locate the pet’s owner to alleviate the
       animal’s distress. If the owner is not located, 52 SFS may enter the vehicle at their
       discretion. Neither the US Air Force nor 52 SFS will be liable for any damages resulting
       to a vehicle as a result of actions taken to alleviate the pet’s distress. When 52 SFS enters
       a vehicle to release a pet, a 52 SFS Management Information System report, with
       required paperwork, will be generated.
       1.2.9. Upon the notification of a complaint or recognition of supposed inhumane
       conditions by 52 SFS or 52 CES/CEOIE, the installation VCO will be notified and upon
       review of circumstances and conditions, advise the 52 MSG/CC on disposition of the
       animal. 52 SFS may assist 52 CES/CEOIE in locating the animal for impoundment.
       1.2.10. Commercial breeding or raising of pets on government property is prohibited.
       1.2.11. Pets are not permitted in public buildings except for facilities designated for their
       use. An exception will be made for service animals trained in the assistance of people
       with a disability, pets utilized in approved pet-facilitated therapy programs, and pets kept
       in Department of Defense Dependent School (DoDDS) classrooms and Child
       Development Centers (CDC). The school or CDC will inform the installation VCO of
       any pets maintained in the vicinity of children. Service animals are not considered to be
       a pet.
       1.2.12. German law imposes absolute liability on animal owners, including damage to
       property or injury to persons caused by a pet, whether the pet is in the owner’s
       possession, lost or abandoned. Liability insurance is recommended for all pet owners.
       1.2.13. Pet abandonment is a crime in Germany and a violation of this regulation.
       Personnel responsible for pet abandonment are subject to disciplinary actions by civil or
       military authorities.

       testing. At no time will an animal be shot by a firearm unless it is a life-threatening
       situation. If such action is deemed necessary, care will be taken not to destroy or injure
       the head, and the carcass will be immediately delivered to the VCO for laboratory testing.
3. Procedures:
   3.1. Registration:
       3.1.1. Pet owners must register their pets with the Spangdahlem VTF within 14 days
       upon arrival for duty at the 52 FW or when an animal reaches 14 weeks of age.
Personnel who own pets are required to out-process through the Spangdahlem VTF prior to final
departure from the installation. The owner will sign out the necessary health certificates and
records regarding the animal at that time.
       3.1.2. If pet ownership is transferred, it is the responsibility of the original owner to
       report the change of ownership to the Spangdahlem VTF.
   3.2. Immunizations. Animals will be immunized in accordance with the following
   requirements:
       3.2.1. All dogs, cats and ferrets over 14 weeks of age will be immunized against rabies
       initially and subsequently in accordance with applicable laws and policies established by
       the VCO.
       3.2.2. Dogs: Other canine immunizations (e.g. canine distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus,
       parainfluenza virus and leptospirosis) will be given in accordance with applicable laws (if
       any) and policies established by the VCO.
       3.2.3. Cats: Other feline immunizations (e.g. feline rhinotracheitis, calicivirus and
       panleukopenia virus) will be given in accordance with applicable laws (if any) and
       policies established by the VCO. Proof of a negative Feline Leukemia Virus/Feline
       Immunodeficiency Virus test is strongly recommended.
       3.2.4. Ferrets: Other ferret vaccines (e.g. distemper virus vaccine) will be administered
       as recommended by the veterinarian. Ferret-approved vaccines are not always available
       at the Spangdahlem VTF, but the Spangdahlem VTF wil provide a list of off base
       veterinarians on request.
       3.2.5. All animals arriving to Spangdahlem AB will be considered unimmunized unless a
       written certificate of current immunization, issued by a licensed veterinarian, can be
       shown as documentation.

    3.3. Animal Control:
       3.3.1. Pet owners will ensure their pet is accompanied by a responsible person capable of
       controlling the animal.
       3.3.2. Cats and dogs will wear a collar or harness with the rabies immunization tag
       attached when they are outdoors. Additionally, dogs with aggressive tendencies will be
       further restricted by a muzzle or short leash. This applies to all dogs of breeds
       recognized as dangerous according to applicable host nation laws.
       3.3.3. 52 CES/CEOIE will be responsible for stray animal control and impoundment. In
       accordance with AFI 48-131, the installation commander will determine the protocol for
       impoundment, disposal, or other physical control of privately-owned and stray animals
       on the installation. The Spangdahlem VTF will be available during weekly business
       hours to assist in identification of stray pets and their registered owners.
       3.3.4. Fees may be levied against owners of impounded pets to defray the costs of
       impoundment. Fees will be assessed in an amount sufficient to defray costs of
       confinement, necessary medical treatment and immunizations, if required. No pet will be
       released without being registered and meeting the VCO's requirements for
       immunizations. Emergency veterinary care and consultation services for stray animals
       will be provided in accordance with AFI 48-131. Off-base pet owners can obtain
       information about stray animals picked up on base by contacting 52 CES/CEOIE.
    3.4. Rabies Suspects:
       3.4.1. Military personnel involved in an animal bite or scratch incidents will seek
       documented medical consultation or treatment within one duty day. Dependents involved
       in an animal bite or scratch incident are strongly encouraged to seek prompt medical
       treatment.
       3.4.2. Personnel who observe an animal on base showing unusual or threatening
       behavior will notify 52 CES/CEOIE, who will take immediate steps to capture the
       animal. Off-base personnel should contact appropriate local national agencies.
       3.4.3. If a pet bites or scratches, the injured person (or guardian, if the individual is a
       juvenile) should obtain as much information about the biting animal as possible (while
       avoiding further injury). Ownership, location, type of animal, color, and vaccination
       history are all vital facts that must be obtained. If the animal is wild or appears to be a
       stray animal, 52 CES/CEOIE should be notified to attempt to apprehend the animal.
       Medical personnel treating a bite or scratch incident should reference Medical Group
       Instruction 48-103, Management and Treatment of Animal Related Incidents.
       3.4.4. Pets which have bitten or scratched a person which are owned by military
       personnel will be examined by Spangdahlem VTF personnel and then quarantined at
       home or at a civilian veterinary clinic at the owner’s expense. After the 10-day
       quarantine period, if deemed healthy under examination by a veterinarian, and after all
       requirements of relevant instructions are met, the pet will be released to the owner. Off
       base veterinarians must provide documentation to the installation VCO when they
       perform a post-quarantine examination of an animal.
    3.5. Disposition of Dead Animals:
SPANGDAHLEMABI48-102 30 JUNE 2010                                                             7


      3.5.1. Owners are responsible for disposal of dead pets. Pets that die at home may be
      delivered to the Spangdahlem VTF for disposal by the VTF. Pet owners will comply
      with local national laws regarding the disposition of deceased pets. Cremation service
      information is available through the Spangdahlem VTF. Fees will be collected to defray
      the costs of disposal services.
      3.5.2. Animals which die on Spangdahlem AB are subject to necropsy examinations by
      the VCO when the VCO deems it necessary. Dead animals will be reported to the
      Spangdahlem VTF by SFS, or the 52d Civil Engineer Squadron (52 CES).
      3.5.3. Dead stray or wild animals will be removed from base areas by 52 CES personnel.
   3.6. Veterinary Services:
      3.6.1. Veterinary service provided to pets owned by military personnel and their
      dependents is subject to availability of veterinary personnel and other resources. Hours
      of operation will be established by the installation veterinarian. Veterinary care for
      privately owned pets will be provided only during regular clinic hours. Emergency care
      is not offered at the Spangdahlem VTF. Personnel may use any of the civilian
      veterinarians in the area. A list of off base veterinarians will be available at the
      Spangdahlem VTF.
      3.6.2. The VTF is operated as an outpatient clinic for the purpose of administering
      required immunizations, diagnostic services, and treatment of those diseases which are
      real or potential threats to the health of the community or its animal population. Limited
      in-patient care is provided as unit staffing permits. Proof of ownership will be required,
      as veterinary care is limited to bona fide pets of military members authorized military
      medical privileges.
      3.6.3. All biologicals and medications used for disease control of privately-owned pets
      will be furnished at the owner’s expense.
      3.6.4. A $2.00 surcharge will be assessed per cash register transaction when services or
      supplies are received at the VTF.
      3.6.5. All dogs and cats registered with and receiving services from the VTF, whether
      residing on or off base, will be permanently identified with an internationally
      recognizable microchip.
