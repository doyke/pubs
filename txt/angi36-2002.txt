any question on the NGB Form 3621, ANG Eligibility Checklist for Enlistment, Reenlistment, or
Extension of Enlistment, review Table 1.3. to determine enlistment eligibility.
   1.2.1. Recruiters are the only authorized personnel able to conduct pre-enlistment interviews
   of all applicants in order to determine their qualifications for enlistment. Recruiters will not
   process an individual believed to be mentally, morally, or physically unacceptable for the
   service as outlined in this instruction. If an individual insists on being processed, and the
   recruiter believes that refusal may embarrass the ANG, he or she will suspend all preliminary
   screening and seek guidance from his or her supervisor.
       1.2.1.1. Applicants who will require a waiver or Exception to Policy (ETP) as identified
       in Tables 1.3. or 1.4., will not be scheduled for a physical until final approval is received
       from the appropriate approval/disapproval authority. This policy does not apply to rules
       22, 29 and 38 in Table 1.3.
   1.2.2. Under no circumstances will job interviews be conducted at unit level. The Adjutant
   General (TAG) will authorize in writing whether unit orientation briefings for new applicants
   will be conducted. If authorized, these briefings will consist of informing the applicant of
   squadron/flight unique requirements. If during the briefing, the briefer discovers information
   they feel may be disqualifying for enlistment, or the applicant declines to accept
   requirements of the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), the FSS Officer should be notified
   immediately to verify whether or not such information is in fact disqualifying. If the state
   AG chooses to utilize unit orientation briefings, it is incumbent upon the state to ensure that
   the briefings are accomplished for all applicants, information covered in the briefings are not
   discriminatory, and the orientation is presented in a fair and equitable manner.
   1.2.3. The military records of a Prior Service (PS) applicant must be closely examined to
   determine the manner in which the service was performed and progression within their
   previous skill. When considering a PS applicant for enlistment, all service documents will be
   obtained and reviewed to determine the reason for discharge or separation from each
   previous military service. An applicant’s enlistment eligibility will be determined only after
   an overall view of previous military service (see paragraph 1.17).
       1.2.3.1. Each of the following criteria will be considered on each document issued by the
       previous branch of military service; Type of Separation, Character of Service, Separation
       Program Designator (SPD), Reenlistment Eligibility (RE) code, and Narrative Reason for
       Separation.
       1.2.3.2. To obtain prior military service records, use SF Form 180, Request Pertaining to
       Military Records (see paragraph 2.1.8.). An obvious need for further training or the
       necessity to train in an entirely new career field should be carefully weighed along with
       any other factors that have a bearing on the individual's potential value to the unit in light
       of the criteria specified in this and other governing directives.
   1.2.4. The Air National Guard (ANG) policy for Pre-service Drug Abuse, including Pre-
   service marijuana usage and self-admission to drug involvement is outlined in Attachment 4.
   1.2.5. Applicants will not be processed at any United States Military Entrance Processing
   Command (USMEPCOM) Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) (this applies to the
   physical portion only) or ANG Medical Group whose last admitted Pre-Service Marijuana
 8                                                              ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012


     use is within 45 days of application. Processing may continue after 46 days or more have
     elapsed and the requirements of paragraph 2.7.6. have been met.
     1.2.6. After the initial screening process, applicants testing positive for any illegal substance
     at MEPS or ANG Medical Group will be permanently barred from enlistment into the ANG.
     NO WAIVER OR ETP WILL BE GRANTED.
1.3. ANG Enlistment Authority. The Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) under Title 10 USC §
12102(b) may approve or deny the enlistment of qualified, effective, and able-bodied persons
into the ANG.
1.4. Enlistment/Reenlistment Waiver Authority. The Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB)
may waive disqualifying factors not set by statute, Department of Defense (DoD) policy, or
otherwise stated in this instruction. The CNGB has delegated the enlistment/reenlistment waiver
authorities for the ANG as indicated in Chapters 1, 2, and 4 of this instruction.
     1.4.1. The ANG Surgeon General may waive physical standards for enlistment In
     Accordance With (IAW) Air Force Instruction (AFI) 48-123, Medical Examination and

retested, the resulting scores become the score of record.
4. If there is a break in service, all PS applicants with AFQT scores of 30 or below must retest
prior to being enlisted. If they attain a higher score, they may be enlisted. The retest becomes
the score of record. A waiver of the minimum AFQT score will not be permitted.
5. The AFQT requirement does not apply to immediate reenlistment or extension of enlistment
for PALACE CHASE applicants, PALACE FRONT applicants, United States Air Force Reserve
(USAFR) transfers, current ANG members or ANG members transferring from one state to
another IAW paragraph 1.2 and 2.1.8.1.
6. PS or NPS applicants enlisting for the sole purpose of being commissioned are not required to
take an ASVAB, unless they fail to obtain a commission.
7. PS ANG/ USAFR/ USAF personnel enlisting into a previously held AFSC will not be
required to retest as long as they qualify with a 3-skill level or higher. Appropriate skill level
will be determined IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officers and Airmen).

1.9. Applicants with Dependents. Service in the ANG and the United States Air Force
(USAF) entails potential sacrifice in the form of frequent training periods, duty away from
family members in the event of mobilization, the demands of shift work, and 24-hour availability
to accomplish the mission. For applicants (PS or NPS) use Table 1.4., to determine eligibility.
PS personnel enlisting from another service component with no break in service, do not require a

1.11. Applicants Ineligible to Enlist. The criteria for determining ineligibility of applicants, or
conditions that require specific authority for enlistment are contained in Table 1.3 and Table
1.9. All telephone or e-mail inquires/questions concerning ineligibility criteria for enlistment
will be addressed to the State or Territory Recruiting and Retention Superintendent (RRS). The
RRS in turn may call NGB, Chief, Force Management Division (NGB/A1P) for further
information or clarification.
1.12. Personnel Security Investigations. Security clearance investigations will be submitted
IAW AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management. The processing of all security

Wing Security Managers.
   1.12.1. Security Clearance Requirements. Recruiters are responsible for providing enlistees
   with Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).
       1.12.1.1. A National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit Check (NACLC),
       or Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) will need to be initiated on all NPS
       members. The type of security clearance will be based on individual career field
       classification. All first time NPS military accessions require a NACLC, and the NACLC
       will be used to access secret information. An SSBI will be initiated if the member is
       going to require access to Top Secret information (A NACLC will not be initiated if Top
       Secret access is required). The projected Unit Security Manager will ensure the
       completed e-QIP is submitted to the Wing Security Manager, with notification of the
       submission to the FSS, no later than 2 Unit Training Assemblies (UTA) after enlistment.
       The member should not report to BMT without a completed e-QIP, which has been
       validated and submitted by the Wing Security Manager. Check with the Wing Security

       1.12.1.2. A NACLC, a SSBI or a Periodic Re-investigation will be initiated on all PS
       members. PS applicants, who previously held a security clearance, will need to have the
       security clearance verified by Wing Security Manager prior to initiating the paperwork.
       If the PS applicant has not had a break in service longer than 24 months, Wing Security
       Manager will research and determine if the clearance can be reinstated. If the break is
       longer than 24 months, the member must initiate the appropriate paperwork. The
       projected Unit Security Manager will ensure the completed paperwork is submitted to
       Wing Security Manager, with notification of the submission to the FSS no later than 3
       working days after enlistment. Check with the Wing Security Manager on the status on
       prior clearance and e-QIP status.
   1.12.2. Security clearance processing. FSS enlistment representatives are responsible for
   ensuring members initiate their e-QIP, with the projected Unit Security Manager as part of
   their in processing. The projected Unit Security Manager must ensure the completed forms
   are forwarded to the Wing Security Manager no later than 3 workdays after enlistment. The
   Wing Security Manager will track progression of submitted forms until the investigation has

   ANG and as a Reserve of the Air Force up to the grade of E-5; lower grade is at the
   discretion of the commander.
   1.15.2. Former commissioned officers with prior enlisted service may be enlisted in the
   highest permanent enlisted grade held or E-5, whichever is higher, lower grade is at the
   discretion of the commander. (See Table 1.7., Note 6).
1.16. Date of Rank (DOR). For determining the appropriate DOR for enlistment into the ANG
use Table 1.8.
1.17. Enlistment of Applicants with PS:
   1.17.1. Normally, applicants who can substantiate satisfactory PS may be enlisted. Refer to
   Table 1.3, to determine enlistment eligibility based on PS and Table 1.9., to determine the
   qualifying or disqualifying RE code. The purposes of both tables are to allow the possible
   enlistment of members who have previously served satisfactorily as a member of the United
   States Armed Forces. Enlistment waivers should not be processed unless specifically
   authorized by the table or in case of extenuating circumstances (e.g., RE codes obviously
   issued in error). When considering an applicant for a waiver, you must consider his or her
   overall service record and the manner in which all service was performed. For waivers or
   exceptions to policy previously approved for enlistment in any branch of the United States
   Armed Forces see paragraphs 2.6.1.1 and 2.6.1.2.
ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                       15


   1.17.2. An applicant who’s NGB 22, Report of Separation and Record of Service, shows no
   positive statement indicating eligibility for reenlistment, will not be enlisted until the reason
   for discharge/separation is verified. If the reason for discharge was for cause, the applicant
   will not be enlisted unless a waiver is authorized under Table 1.3. If a waiver is not
   authorized, applicants should be encouraged to submit requests for correction of military
   records as indicated in Table 1.9., Note 2 in order to qualify for enlistment.
   1.17.3. Applicants who do not have 84 days of Active Duty (AD)/IADT and who have
   completed a recognized BMT course may be enlisted and immediately placed on AD/IADT
   for the balance of the 84 day period when approved by the Director of Staff (DS). A two
   week military orientation course will not be considered as a recognized BMT. All applicants
   who have not completed a recognized BMT course will be required to attend USAF BMT.
   UTAs will not be considered as qualifying duty time.
   1.17.4. PS Navy Reserve or United States Coast Guard applicants who attended an
   orientation course and have completed 5 or more consecutive years of satisfactory service,
   are eligible for enlistment up to the grade of E-5. Enlistment in a lower grade is at the
   discretion of the commander.
1.18. Key Employee Certificate of Availability:
   1.18.1. There is no requirement to obtain a Certificate of Availability from all members who
   are federal employees. A key position is a government or statutory civilian position, which
   requires at least 90 days of specialized training or experience in a federal, state, or local
   government agency or defense-supporting industry. There is a requirement to obtain a
   Certificate of Availability of Key Employees (Figure 1.1) on those applicants who have been
   designated in a category as a key federal employee. A key employee is a civilian employee
   of a federal, state, or local government agency or defense-supporting industry who is in a key
   position for which no qualified replacement is immediately available, and whose duties
   cannot be reassigned to other employees. A Certificate of Availability is required to verify
   that recall to military duty would not seriously impair the functioning and continuity of the
   employing agency or industry.
   1.18.2. Key employee status is determined by the employer. If an employer notifies a unit
   that a member is a key employee, the member must be reassigned to the appropriate section
   at the Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) IAW AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement
   Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members, within 90 days unless
   the employer rescinds the designation or an appeal is approved.
   1.18.3. If designated a key employee (Figure 1.2) by their employer, a member who wants
   to stay in the unit may:
      1.18.3.1. Ask the unit commander for help in resolving the matter with the employer.
      1.18.3.2. Ask the unit commander to file an appeal based on military needs. The appeal
      will be processed only if the commander can be assured that the member will be a usable
      resource at mobilization. This appeal must be filed within 30 days after the receipt of the
      employer’s notification that the individual is a key employee, and sent to the TAG for
      approval/disapproval.

     1.18.4. The unit commander's endorsement to the appeal must verify the information that has
     been provided by the member. The appeal must go through the member’s chain of command
     before TAG’s review. Each endorser should either:
        1.18.4.1. Recommend approval based on overriding military need and forward the appeal
        to the next higher headquarters, or:
        1.18.4.2. Disapprove the appeal and send it back through channels to the unit
        commander who must then inform the member.
     1.18.5. An appeal is filed by the member within 30 days after receipt of the employer's
     notification. The member must recognize that an appeal is to maintain membership in the
     ANG and not to challenge an employer's decision that a position is key. The member's
     civilian employment must not be placed in jeopardy. An appeal must include but is not
     limited to:
        1.18.5.1. A statement of the member's desire to remain in the ANG.
        1.18.5.2. A statement that the matter could not be resolved with the employer.
        1.18.5.3. A summary of the actions which have been taken to resolve the matter with the
        employer. If the member prefers that the agency not be contacted, the member should so
        state.
        1.18.5.4. The member's primary and secondary AFSC, and the authorized grade and
        AFSC of the position to which assigned.
        1.18.5.5. A summary of the member's participation, to include the number of satisfactory
        years of service for retirement.
        1.18.5.6. An appropriate statement of the essentiality and of the military necessity of
        remaining a member of the unit. This area should be jointly worked with the military
        supervisor or commander.
        1.18.5.7. A statement on assignment in a mobility position, and if the assignment has
        appropriate back up with member not currently filling a mobility position number.
     1.18.6. The Federal Emergency Management Agency determines which business firms are
     defense supporting and surveys members of the Ready Reserve who are in key positions.
     1.18.7. Key employees of the Federal Aviation Administration will not be approved for
     continued membership. Members with a MSO will be processed IAW AFI 36-3209.

     11. There are no provisions to allow an applicant with disqualifying body markings to
     process and proceed to BMT on the condition that the markings will be removed once on

     12. Recruiters must question applicants about tattoos/brands/markings, piercings, and/or
     body modifications during their interview/job counseling and prior to departure for BMT.

     tattoos/brands/markings in an ―undergarment area‖, you must request that a female recruiter
     or service member view the tattoos/brands/markings and then describe them to you.
     13. All applicants should be briefed by their recruiter that once they are qualified,
     additional tattoos/brands/markings or body modifications may render them unqualified for
     service.
     14. Any member obtaining unauthorized tattoos will be required to remove them at his/her

                               PROCESSING PROCEDURES

2.1. Pre-qualifying Applicants:
   2.1.1. A recruiter will interview applicants to determine their qualifications for enlistment.
   Thoroughly investigate any facts that may disqualify the applicant before continuing
   processing. All PS claims must be verified from separation documents, such as DD Form
   214 or NGB 22, before enlistment (see paragraph 2.1.8, Table 1.3, and Table 1.9).
      2.1.1.1. It is mandatory for the applicant to complete the NGB Form 3621 prior to any
      enlistment actions. If the applicant answers ―Yes‖ to any questions, they may be
      ineligible for enlistment. Therefore, it is beneficial, not mandatory, to have the applicant
      complete this form during the recruiter’s initial interview. If this option is used, the
      applicant will recertify his/her answers prior to completing enlistment actions. Use Table
      1.3.., to determine eligibility. More information may be requested from the member to
      make a final determination. File a copy in ARMS as an attachment to the DD Form 4.
   2.1.2. Verification of age. (The burden of proof is on the applicant.) The only acceptable
   documents for verification of age are:
      2.1.2.1. Birth certificate including hospital or delayed birth/court certificate.
      2.1.2.2. Statement by State Registrar of Vital Statistics or similar State official.
      2.1.2.3. DD Form 214, NGB 22, or other separation document for PS applicants. Accept
      date of birth recorded thereon as a verified date (cannot be used for proof of citizenship).
      2.1.2.4. DD Form 372, Request for Verification of Birth.
      2.1.2.5. Official US Passport identifying the holder as a US citizen.
   2.1.3. Identity. Ensure that the applicant is the same person whose name is recorded on the
   document substantiating his/her age; verify name with social security card, driver's license,
   etc.
   2.1.4. Parental consent. Do not process for enlistment any unmarried applicant, who has not
   reached his/her 18th birthday, until the consent of the parents or legal guardian is obtained on
   DD Form 1966.
   2.1.5. Mental testing. (See Table 1.1., for aptitude requirements). Applicants will be
   administered the ASVAB IAW DoD Directive 1304.12, Armed Services Vocational Aptitude
   Battery (ASVAB), and AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System, at a MEPS
   or a Mobile Examining Test (MET) site with the following exceptions:
      2.1.5.1. When a unit is more than 50 miles or a one hour drive from a MEPS or MET
      site, units may consider, with DS approval, sending applicants to a different MEPS or
      MET. Justification must include record of efforts to resolve the problem through the
      local interservice recruitment committee.
      2.1.5.2. The Enlistment Screening Test (EST) should be used to screen applicants to
      determine those most qualified and consequently those who should be scheduled for the
48                                                          ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012


     ASVAB. Test control officers can obtain the EST by ordering AFPT 900/901, Test
     Booklet; Air Force Proficiency Test (AFPT) 902, Answer Sheet; and AFPT 903, Answer
     Key.
  2.1.6. Vacancy. Enlist only to fill valid UMD position vacancies or against a projected
  vacancy, IAW ANGI 36-2101. Ensure applicant is qualified for entry into career field IAW
  the AFECD.
  2.1.7. Medical examination. Applicants will be given, or must possess, a current qualifying
  medical examination IAW procedures and standards outlined in DoDI 6130.03. Physical
  examination may be obtained from any military medical facility or authorized contract
  physician.
     2.1.7.1. All "working copy" MEPS physicals used for enlistment require the completion
     of both the front and backsides of DD Form 2807 and DD Form 2808. Upon receipt of a
     MEPS "working copy" physical by the ANG Recruiting Activity, the applicant may be
     accessed on a "conditional enlistment" pending the results of all lab tests including HIV.
     Final approval of the MEPS medical examination will be determined by the MEPS
     Facility upon receipt of all lab tests. Original DD Form 2807, DD Form 2808, and all
     supporting documentation will then be retrieved by the ANG Recruiting Activity. ANG
     recruiters are responsible for providing the MEPS approved DD Form 2807, DD Form
     2808, and all supporting documentation to the ANG Medical Facility for classification
     purposes verifying the profile. Those members undergoing enlistment physicals at the
     ANG medical clinic may be accessed on a "conditional enlistment" pending the results of
     all lab tests including HIV if the physical is otherwise complete and qualified. Final
     approval of the ANG clinic medical examination will be determined by the ANG medical
     clinic upon receipt of all lab tests. Individuals enlisted under this "conditional
     enlistment" provision will not attend training, to include UTAs, annual field training, or
     formal training, until final approval of the medical examination has been received from
     the MEPS Facility or ANG medical clinic. The following statement will be included in
     bold print on the DD Form 4 - Armed Forces of the United States, in the remarks section
     for all ANG applicants enlisting under a "conditional enlistment": "I FULLY
     UNDERSTAND THAT MY ENLISTMENT INTO THE AIR NATIONAL GUARD IS
     CONTINGENT UPON FINAL APPROVAL OF MY PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.
     ANY MEDICAL FINDINGS OF AN EXISTING PRIOR TO SERVICE (EPTS)
     CONDITION OR ANY OTHER DISQUALIFYING MEDICAL CONDITION UNLESS
     WAIVED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 1.3., OF ANGI 36-2002, RENDERS THIS
     ENLISTMENT CONTRACT NULL AND VOID AND WILL RESULT IN MY
     INELIGIBILITY TO COMPLETE ENLISTMENT INTO THE ANG." Recruiters will
     ensure that this statement is specifically briefed and the consequences explained to the
     applicant and both the applicant and recruiter initial and date the statement.
  2.1.8. PS personnel. It is the responsibility of the enlisting activity to verify all PS claims
  made by prospective enlistees. The applicant must complete and sign SF 180, Request
  Pertaining to Military Records. Verification of PS for individuals separated since calendar
  year 1973 may be obtained by writing the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC),
  Monterey, CA 93940, or by phoning the DMDC 1-800-538-5916 for units outside California
  or 1-800-682-4825 for units in California or Defense Switch Network (DSN) 878-2111 from
  0700-1600 hours daily (Pacific Standard Time). Verification for individuals separated before
ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     49


  calendar year 1973 may be obtained from official documents in possession of the individual,
  or written verification requested from the appropriate service agency as listed on the reverse
  side of the SF 180. The enlisting activity will use DD Form 214, NGB 22, or other
  separation documents to determine applicant's enlistment eligibility. Individuals with RE
  codes listed as acceptable in Table 1.9., may be enlisted, provided they are otherwise eligible.
  All others require NGB/A1P approval.
     2.1.8.1. Classification. See AFI 36-2101.
     2.1.8.2. Grade/skill relationship. See AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel, and
     the AFECD.
  2.1.9. Enlistment of applicants with current military status:
     2.1.9.1. Members of other reserve components may be enlisted in the ANG if a
     conditional release is obtained before enlistment. These applicants must meet all
     eligibility requirements of this instruction for enlistment in the ANG. Other criteria and
     processing procedures are contained in AFI 36-2115, and AFI 36-2004, Interservice

  according to Figure 2.1. The FDS will process, monitor and send all FTETP requests to
  NGB/A1DC for approval/disapproval. The FDS will establish a tracking method to ensure
  all approved FTETP members are scheduled for TTS within 365 days from the member’s
  BMT graduation date.
  2.5.10. Applicants for enlistment will be made aware of the following:
     2.5.10.1. TTSs can be booked up to one year in advance pending release of FY quotas;

   year IAW ANGI 36-2001.
      2.5.14.1. During UTAs, supervisors should conduct training on apprentice (3-Skill
      Level) tasks as outlined in the appropriate Career Field Education and Training Plan.
      2.5.14.2. This training may not be used as justification for a waiver of entry-level
      technical training requirements.
   2.5.15. When preparing orders due to a FTETP, prepare the BMT order for only the BMT
   portion of the IADT. For the TTS prepare another BMT order for only the TTS portion. In
   the school portion of the order replace the default BMT information with the TTS
   information. In the remarks section, add the following statement: ―Individual is NPS,
   member is in Phase II of IADT due to Formal Training Exception to Policy (FTETP). BMT
   completed on [insert date]‖.
   2.5.16. Reporting Procedures:
      2.5.16.1. All airmen with a FTETP will report the Monday, prior to the week of the
      Course Start Date (CSD) (7-12 days prior). This is due to Air Education and Training

      mandatory briefings.
      2.5.16.2. All airmen with a FTETP must travel and report to their training squadrons (not

2.6. Waiver or ETP Processing for Enlistment:
   2.6.1. Reporting: It is mandatory for the RRS to report waiver data quarterly to NGB/RS
   using the format provided in Attachment 6 no later than the 15th of the month. NGB/RS will
   combine all reports and submit to OUSD(P&R)/MPP.
       2.6.1.1. Waivers or ETPs previously approved for enlistment (except as indicated in
       paragraph 2.6.1.1.1) in any branch of the US Armed Services do not require a
       subsequent waiver for ANG enlistment, provided they were approved at the same/similar
       or higher level as required by this instruction. A copy of the previous waiver will be filed
       in ARMS as an attachment to the DD 4 after the enlistment process is complete. If a
       copy of the previous waiver cannot be located, a waiver request must be forwarded to
       NGB/A1P as outlined in Chapter 5.
          2.6.1.1.1. If a PS applicant has received an approved waiver or ETP for enlistment
          into another branch of the US Armed Services and the reason was due to Unfitness,
          Inaptitude, Fraud, Misconduct (i.e. Drug Abuse), Unsatisfactory Performance or
          Unsuitability, a review is required by NGB/A1.
       2.6.1.2. If the waiver or ETP is for physical/medical reasons, every request will be
       forwarded through medical channels to NGB/SGPA for approval.
   2.6.2. Waiver or ETP requests will be in letter format as shown in Figure 5.1., with routing
   as explained in Chapter 5. Attach a copy of the completed SF 180 signed by both the
   applicant and a recruiter or FSS representative authorizing the ANG access to PS records,
   when appropriate.

   2.6.3. Applicants under restraint, under sentence of a court, or who have been found guilty
   of a felony under federal, local or state laws, or where confinement exceeded one year (not
   necessarily imposed), are not eligible for waiver or ETP.
   2.6.4. In evaluating an arrest record, information indicating acquittal, dropped charges,
   expunged record, case dismissal, or that the individual was the subject of a "nolle prosequi,"
   does not negate the significance of the underlying conduct. Therefore, to protect the interests
   of the ANG, base eligibility determinations on available information concerning a person's
   conduct and actions rather than the legal outcome of a criminal proceeding:
      2.6.4.1. These factors may mitigate disqualifying information. Consider them in the
      waiver process:
          2.6.4.1.1. Immaturity attributable to the age of the individual at the time of the
          offense.
          2.6.4.1.2. Circumstances surrounding the offense.
          2.6.4.1.3. Isolated nature of the conduct.
          2.6.4.1.4. Incident occurred in one's youth with no subsequent criminal conduct.
          2.6.4.1.5. Temporary conditions contributed to the conduct, (such as parents' divorce,
          serious illness, or death in immediate family, etc.) with no subsequent criminal
          conduct.
   2.6.5. When reviewing waivers of juvenile delinquency, DS should request the following:
      2.6.5.1. Nature of offenses and dates committed.
      2.6.5.2. Number of offenses and age of applicant at time of offenses.
      2.6.5.3. Copy of the report of investigation completed by juvenile authorities, juvenile
      courts, police authorities, detention homes, reformatories, or any other appropriate source
      of information as to the applicant's character and rehabilitation, the actual offenses
      committed, circumstances in the case, disposition by the courts, actual confinement
      served, and whether any form of civil restraint still exists.
      2.6.5.4. Present reputation in community in which residing, as evidenced by three letters
      of recommendation from reputable citizens other than relatives.

                                (Non-Prior Service Applicants)


Statues of Law (38 USC 2021-2027) provides a reemployment rights program for men and
women who leave jobs with private employers, the Federal Government, or a State or local
government to enter into the US Armed Forces. To be entitled to reemployment rights, a veteran
may serve for not more than 4 years (plus a one year extension for the convenience of the
Government), satisfactorily complete the period of AD, be qualified to perform the duties of the
former position, and make timely application for reemployment after completion of service. The
Department of Labor, through its office of Veteran's Reemployment Rights, is responsible for
providing information about the rights you have and any assistance you need in connection with
exercising them. We are cooperating to bring this important matter to your attention, but there
are certain conditions you must meet. If you are found not qualified for enlistment, your
reemployment rights may be impaired if you have not requested a leave of absence from your

                                            Chapter 4

                 REENLISTMENT AND EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT

4.1. No individual will reenlist or extend their enlistment without the concurrence of the
unit commander. A commander may approve or deny reenlistments and extension of
enlistments to any member of his or her command. Continued retention in the ANG is a
command prerogative and is not an inherent right of any individual unless the member has
between 18 and 20 years of satisfactory service towards a reserve retirement. In those cases,
only the SAF may deny retention. Reenlistments and extension may not exceed a member’s
HYT except as explain in Paragraph 4.5.
   4.1.1. Individuals rendered ineligible for reenlistment or extension of enlistment IAW Table
   4.1, will be separated on their ETS.
4.2. Complete the following forms before each reenlistment or extension of enlistment
action:
   4.2.1. NGB Form 3621, ANG Eligibility Checklist for Enlistment, Reenlistment, or Extension
   of Enlistment. The member will complete this mandatory questionnaire prior to any
   reenlistment or extension actions. If the member answers ―Yes‖ to any questions, they may
   be ineligible for reenlistment or extension of enlistment. Therefore, it is beneficial, not
   mandatory, to have the member complete this form prior to the supervisor initiating the AF
   Form 418, Selective Reenlistment Program (SRP) Consideration for Airmen in the Regular
   Air Force/Air Force Reserve. If this option is used, the member will recertify his/her
   answers prior to completing reenlistment/extension actions. Use Table 4.1., to determine
   eligibility. More information may be requested from the member to make a final
   determination. File a copy in ARMS as an attachment to the DD Form 4 or AF IMT 1411, as
   applicable.
   4.2.2. AF 2030, USAF Drug and Alcohol Abuse Certificate. The member will complete this
   form prior to any reenlistment or extension of enlistment actions. Self-admission to any
   illegal drugs, after enlistment in the ANG, will result in immediate discharge IAW AFI 36-
   3209. If the member answers yes to any questions, they may be ineligible for reenlistment or
   extension of enlistment. Use Table 4.1., to determine eligibility. File a copy in ARMS.
   4.2.3. AF Form 418, Selective Reenlistment Program (SRP) Consideration for Airmen in the
   Regular Air Force/Air Force Reserve. The member’s supervisor and commander will
   complete this form prior to any reenlistment actions. File a copy in ARMS.
       4.2.3.1. Supervisors may initiate AF Form 418 (optional) and make recommendations by
       initialing or placing an "X", in the appropriate item of Section II, sign and date the forms,
       and forward to the unit commanders.
       4.2.3.2. Unit commanders document their decision by placing an "X" or initials in the
       appropriate item of Section III, and entering their rationale if not selecting for
       reenlistment (mandatory). Commanders sign and date the forms and attach any
       supporting documentation to substantiate non-selection decisions. If not selecting an
       individual for reenlistment, but, wants to authorize an extension of enlistment IAW Table
       4.2, the commander will indicate as such in the Remarks section and include the rule
ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   65


      number and reason. (NOTE: When airmen are TDY and won't return within 30 days of
      the decision date, commanders include the following statement in the upper margin of the
      AF Form 418: "Airman is TDY until (expected return date)".) Commanders send all
      copies of the form to the orderly rooms for return to the FSS. Commanders will schedule
      airmen for personal interviews and accomplish the following:
          4.2.3.2.1. Ensure selected airmen complete Section IV and keep the second copy of
          the forms. Commanders keep the first copy and send the originals to the orderly
          rooms for return to the FSS.
          4.2.3.2.2. Discuss the following items with non-selected airmen: specific reasons for
          non-selection, areas needing improvement, appeal opportunity, and the possibility of
          future reconsideration and selection.
          4.2.3.2.3. Ensure non-selected airmen complete Section IV, and render their appeal
          intent in Section V by the next scheduled Unit Training Assembly (UTA). When
          airmen intend to appeal, commanders send all copies of the completed AF Forms 418
          to the CSS. When airmen don’t intend to appeal, commanders keep the first copy,
          give airmen the second copy, and send the originals to the orderly rooms for return to
          the FSS.
   4.2.4. DD Form 4. Use this form if member is reenlisting. Type this form for each applicant
   who reenlists IAW Attachment 9. Ensure that each entry is accurate and verified by the
   applicant or by substantiating documents. File a copy in ARMS.
   4.2.5. AF Form 1411, Extension or Cancellation of Extensions of Enlistment in the
   REGAF/AFRES/ANG. Use this form to document extensions of enlistments. Instructions for
   completing the form are included at Attachment 8.
4.3. Reenlistment in the ANG.
   4.3.1. Terms of reenlistment within the ANG may be for any unspecified term, not less than
   one year, not more than 6 years, and meet the requirements in Table 4.3.
   4.3.2. Individuals not selected for reenlistment and not eligible for an extension of
   enlistment IAW Table 4.2 will be separated on their ETS.
   4.3.3. Commanders may complete a second AF Form 418 changing the member’s selection
   or non-selection status at any time prior to the ETS.
   4.3.4. Individuals who reenlist in the ANG must concurrently reenlist as a Reserve of the AF
   in the same grade for a period equal to their ANG reenlistment.
4.4. Voluntary Extension of Enlistment in the ANG.
   4.4.1. To determine the authorized terms for extension of enlistments, refer to Table 4.2.
   More than one extension is authorized on a current enlistment contract; however, the total of
   all such extensions on the current enlistment contract will not exceed four years IAW 10
   USC § 509. No exceptions can be considered to extend a member’s enlistment beyond four
   years.
   4.4.2. Extensions of enlistment become effective the day following current ETS.
 66                                                           ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012


   4.4.3. ETPs will not be granted for extensions in order to qualify for the ANG Incentive
   Program.
   4.4.4. Unit commanders and members have the authority to cancel extensions to enlistment
   when the original reason for extension no longer exists provided the member has not entered
   the extension period. Cancelled extensions will result in the ETS reverting to the previous
   date as if the extension never occurred.
4.5. Extension of Enlistment Beyond Eligibility for Retired Pay. The ANG establishes its
HYT for all enlisted members at age 60. The HYT is commensurate with members’ eligibility to
receive retired pay IAW Chapter 67, Title 10, United States Code (USC).
   4.5.1. 10 USC § 12308 restricts members from participating for pay and points beyond their
   sixtieth birthday without the approval of the SAF. However, NGB/A1 may approve
   participation beyond age 60, but no later than age 62, in the following situations:
       4.5.1.1. Extension to qualify for a Reserve Retirement. Enlisted members with 18 but
       less than 20 years of satisfactory service may request retention beyond age 60 to qualify
       for a Reserve Retirement provided the member did not waive retirement eligibility upon
       enlistment and extenuating circumstances precluded eligibility before the member
       reached his or her sixtieth birthday.
       4.5.1.2. Extension to qualify for an Active Duty Retirement. Enlisted members with 18
       but less than 20 years of Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) may request
       retention beyond age 60 to qualify for an Active Duty Retirement provided the member
       did not waive retirement eligibility upon enlistment and extenuating circumstances
       precluded eligibility before the member reached his or her sixtieth birthday.
       4.5.1.3. Extension to qualify for a Civil Service Annuity. Enlisted members serving as
       dual status technicians may request retention beyond age 60 to qualify for a civil service
       annuity. Requests for extension must include verification of civil service annuity
       eligibility date from the state HRO. Members applying for extension under this provision
       must understand that they will only receive pay, not points, for service beyond age 60.
       4.5.1.4. Extension due to Medical Hold. Enlisted members who are approved for a
       medical hold IAW AFI 41-210, Patient Administration Functions, may request retention
       beyond age 60 until the expiration of the medical hold. The approved medical hold must
       be included with the request. Members applying for extension under this provision must
       understand that they will only receive pay, not points, for service beyond age 60.
4.6. Administrative Extension of Enlistment. Enlisted members can be administratively
extended for the purpose of allowing sufficient time for conclusion of a trial or investigation for
a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or the State Military Code, or to
allow sufficient time for a member who is hospitalized, or when affected by the provisions of
―Stop-Loss.‖
   4.6.1. Members may be extended, at the discretion of TAG, when a member has been denied
   reenlistment and has a pending complaint or grievance in their behalf that will not be
   adjudicated prior to their ETS. In this instance, the member will be extended for six months
   or until adjudication is received.
ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  67


   4.6.2. Do not involuntarily retain a member beyond ETS for the processing of an
   administrative discharge action as outlined in AFI 36-3209.

than 10 calendar days from the day they complete AF Form 418, Section V.
   4.7.1. Airmen will appeal to their respective group commanders. (EXCEPTIONS: Airmen
   appeal to their Wing/GSU Commander when their group commanders made the reenlistment
   nonselection decision or to DS-Air when their Wing/GSU Commander made the reenlistment
   nonselection decision.)
   4.7.2. When airman submit their written appeal:
      4.7.2.1. The CSS will construct case file containing (as a minimum) all copies of the AF
      Form 418, documentation submitted by the airman and commander, the airman's last 5
      EPRs (if applicable), and any other pertinent information. (NOTE: Give airman 3
      workdays to rebut any new information added to the case file after they submit their
      appeal.) Within 5 workdays, CSS send the case files to the base legal office for review.

      authority, the group commander may approve the appeal and complete AF Form 418,
      Section VII, or recommend disapproval. Refer to Paragraph 4.7.3 when group
      commanders approve appeals.
      4.7.2.3. When group commanders recommend disapproval, the CSS sends the case file to

      Refer to Paragraph 4.7.3 when Wing/GSU Commander approves appeal. When the
      Wing/GSU Commander recommends disapproval, the CSS forwards the case file to the
      FSS. The FSS will review the case file for administrative accuracy and verify the airman
      was eligible for reenlistment consideration; send the case file to the Military Personnel
      Management Office (MPMO) who will staff to the state legal office for review; and
      include legal advisory in the case file; send the case file to DS-Air through established
      headquarters procedures.
      4.7.2.5. DS-Air approves or disapproves the appeal and completes AF Form 418, Section
      VII. The MPMO returns appeal cases to the servicing FSS for processing according to

   reenlistment ineligibility. The FSS sends all copies of the AF Forms 418 to the unit
   commander, who ensures the airman complete AF Form 418, Section VIII within 5
   workdays. Unit commanders return the originals to the FSS, retain the first copy, and give

Description of Incident(s):
ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                       79


(If two or more incidents are being explained, they will be in chronological order with the
specific dates)


I was at a party with some friends of mine on July 4, 2003. Some individuals at the party asked
me if I wanted to go out to their car and try some marijuana. Unfortunately, I said yes. I was in
their car. There was one person in the driver's seat and two in the back seat. The two people in
the back asked me if I wanted to buy some marijuana, which they passed to me. At this point the
police flashed a light in the car. I dropped what I had on the floor under the back seat. All of us
were arrested. We were all fined $200.00 and placed on probation for six months.



Individual’s role/involvement and the outcome of the incident(s):
I was, in what I feel was an experimental stage of drug use. I had tried marijuana approximately
four or five times prior to my arrest.



Events from arrest to current date:
I don't associate with anyone that I think might possibly be involved with drugs. I am presently
enrolled in night classes at Prince Charles Community College and have completed an
Associate’s Degree in Business Administration. I have been employed with the Calverton Board
of Education since November 5, 2003.


Final Mandatory Statement
(This statement will included)


"I understand my omission of any information required for a thorough evaluation of this waiver
request could result in the disapproval of my application for enlistment into the Air National
Guard. Also, I understand that the omission of any information that is later discovered after
enlistment could result in a discharge from the Air National Guard."

This letter comes in behalf of Jane Public, a senior at Glenn Park High School. I have known
Jane since her freshman year, when I was assigned as her counselor and she was also in my
geometry class. She was a very conscientious student.


Since then, I've known her as a friend throughout her high school years. Jane has found time to
do volunteer work with the Salvation Army and Southern Hospital Center.


With all her involvements, Jane is a friendly and healthy young person and would be a fine
candidate for the Air National Guard.

Re: (Applicant’s Name)


TO: (ANG Recruiter)


This letter is to attest to the fact that Mr. John Doe entered the Alcohol Abuse Services Program,
Brandon Clinic, Brandon, Maryland, on January 22, 2008, as a self-referral. He had experienced
some difficulty in the past year or two while in the military service and was seeking help to
enable him to live an alcohol-free life. After initial screening and evaluation, Mr. Doe was seen
for additional counseling. Mr. Doe has made excellent progress and the prognosis is very
favorable. He now has an extended period of at least fifteen (15) months of sobriety.


                                                    Sincerely,

SUBJECT: Example - Drug Abuse Evaluation (Could be used for Alcohol Abuse or
Rehabilitation)


1. I talked with John Smith on 1 March about his use of marijuana. He explained that his
involvement with the drug mainly was experimental and he was under pressure in college. He
understands very well the implications it has in the military.
2. I have interviewed his ANG coworkers, supervisors, and commander. None of these
individuals have noticed personal or professional deviances that would contraindicate
experimental use by John Smith.
3. I have interviewed his civilian coworkers and supervisors. None of these individuals have
noticed personal or professional deviances that would contraindicate experimental use by John
Smith.
4. It is my opinion that this young man has learned from his mistakes. Further, I see no reason
why Mr. Smith should not be enlisted in the Air National Guard.

               APPLICANT BRIEFING ITEM ON SEPARATION POLICY

Figure A2.1. Applicant Briefing Item on Separation Policy.
As military members, you occupy a unique position in society. You represent the military
establishment. This special status brings with it the responsibility to uphold and maintain the
dignity and high standards of the United States Armed Forces at all times and in all places. The
Armed Forces must also be ready at all times for worldwide deployment. The fact carries with it
the requirement for military units and their members to possess high standards of morale, good
order and discipline, and cohesion. As a result, military laws, rules, customs and traditions
include restrictions on your personal behavior that may be different from civilian life. Members
of the Armed Forces may be involuntarily separated before their enlistment or term of service
ends for various reasons established by law and military regulations. Some acceptable conduct
may be grounds for involuntary separation, such as:


Failure to participate satisfactorily, i.e., attends a minimum of 48 UTA periods, and 15 annual
training days per year, as directed by your commander.


You establish a pattern of disciplinary infractions, or discreditable involvement with civil or
military authorities, or you cause dissent, or disrupt or degrade the mission of your unit. This
may include conduct of any nature that would bring discredit on the Armed Forces in the view of
the civilian community.


Because of parental responsibilities, you are unable to perform your duties satisfactorily or you
are unavailable for worldwide assignment of deployment.


You fail to meet Air Force Fitness Standards.


The illegal or improper use of drugs by Air National Guard members is a serious breach of
discipline and is not compatible with service in the Air National Guard. Individuals confirmed to

            ANG POLICY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF DOMESTIC
      VIOLENCEMISDEMEANOR AMENDMENT TO THE GUN CONTROL ACT
                     (LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT)

A3.1. Part I. References:
   A3.1.1. 18 USC § 922
   A3.1.2. Memoranda dated 27 Nov 02 - DoD Policy for Implementation of Domestic
   Violence Misdemeanor Amendment to the Gun Control Act for Military Personnel
A3.2. Part II. Policy:
   A3.2.1. This attachment, together with the 27 Nov 02 DoD policy memoranda, outlines AF
   policy for implementing the domestic violence amendment (hereinafter the Lautenberg
   Amendment) to the Gun Control Act of 1968 (18 USC § 922) for all military personnel
   (active duty, guard, and reserve). This policy supersedes all previous guidance provided.
   Commanders and supervisors shall take all reasonable and necessary steps to implement this
   policy with regard to their personnel.
   A3.2.2. The Lautenberg Amendment makes it a felony for anyone who has been convicted
   of a ―misdemeanor crime of domestic violence‖ to ship, transport, possess or receive firearms
   or ammunition, and prohibits sales or other dispositions of firearms and ammunition to such
   individuals. Violations may result in a maximum punishment of ten years of imprisonment
   and $250,000 fine. It is incumbent upon commanders and supervisors to ensure compliance
   with the law.
   A3.2.3. The statute concerns convictions for misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence in
   civilian courts. However, DoD policy has extended the prohibition to convictions for crimes
   of domestic violence tried by general or special court-martial, as well as civilian criminal
   felony convictions adjudged on or after 27 November 2002. The restrictions do not apply to
   the actions as a result of summary courts-martial, nonjudicial punishment pursuant to Article
   15, UCMJ, or deferred prosecutions or similar alternative dispositions in civilian courts.
   A3.2.4. Commanders will ensure annual unit training is conducted in order to inform
   personnel of the Lautenberg Amendment, its consequences, and this policy. Training will be
   incorporated into appropriate ANG curriculum. Each installation will provide notice about
   the Lautenberg Amendment by posting information in all facilities in which government
   firearms or ammunition are stored, issued, disposed of, or transported.
   A3.2.5. Military personnel who have qualifying convictions will have no more than 120
   calendar days to obtain an expungement or pardon of the qualifying conviction. Despite this
   period, all Government owned firearms and ammunition shall be retrieved and the member’s
   authority to access firearms and ammunition will we suspended until an expungement or
   pardon is obtained.
A3.3. Part III. Military Procedures:
   A3.3.1. Upon becoming aware of a domestic violence misdemeanor conviction,
   commanders will immediately retrieve and deny the military member access to government-
ANGI36-2002 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  99


  owned firearms and ammunition. Commanders should also contact the local Staff Judge
  Advocate for further guidance regarding this policy, including determinations of whether a
  conviction meets the criterion set forth in the Act. Military members who have a qualifying
  conviction are ineligible for weapons training.
  A3.3.2. Commanders will use the DD Form 2760. This form states that any statement made
  on the form will not be used in a prosecution for violating the Gun Control Act.
  Commanders will direct all military personnel who work with or are required to qualify on a
  firearm, destructive device, or ammunition to complete the DD Form 2760. The DD Form
  2760 must be reaccomplished every time a military member is assigned to duties requiring
  the use of a firearm, destructive device, or ammunition. Commanders will maintain the
  completed DD Form 2760 in the member’s Personal Information File (PIF).
  A3.3.3. The ANG’s procedures to discover whether an applicant for military service has a
  qualifying conviction for a crime of domestic violence shall continue in effect. Therefore,
  members with qualifying convictions, as defined in this memorandum, are ineligible for
  initial enlistment, direct commission, or entry into a program leading to a commission. No
  waivers are authorized.
  A3.3.4. Members possessing a ―misdemeanor crime of domestic violence‖ may not be
  administratively discharged solely on the basis of this policy. However, this does not
  preclude a commander from considering the underlying acts of domestic violence, or a
  civilian conviction, as an appropriate basis for administrative discharge IAW existing
  directives and instructions. All members with a qualifying conviction who are retained will
  be reassigned/ reclassified into duties that do not include either access to or possession of
  firearms or ammunition.
  A3.3.5. Members with qualifying convictions who possess an AFSC that requires them to be
  qualified to bear a firearm will have their AFSC withdrawn IAW AFI 36-2101. If an AFSC
  is withdrawn, and unless administratively discharged, the member will be cross-
  flowed/retrained or reassigned into an AFSC that doesn’t have a requirement to ship,
  transport, possess, or receive firearms or ammunition. There is no waiver to this provision.
  A3.3.6. Members with qualifying convictions will be awarded a ―T‖ assignment limitation
  code (ALC). Assignment limitation code ―T‖ description: member not qualified to ship,
  transport, possess or receive firearms or ammunition. Effective date/duration of the code:
  date of domestic violence conviction/indefinite. Commanders will ensure that a copy of the
  completed DD Form 2760 for anyone who has a qualifying conviction is immediately
  forwarded to the FSS for update in the PDS. The DD Form 2760 will serve as the source
  document and will be filed in ARMS. If a member with an ALC of ―T‖ is transferred to
  another ANG unit, the losing FSS will query the gaining commander for authority to process
  the ANG-to-ANG transfers.
  A3.3.7. DAC ―28‖ has been created to identify members who have a qualifying conviction.
  The DAC 28 should automatically reflect in the system once the ALC ―T‖ is updated but
  commanders will direct the servicing FSS to ensure this code is updated in PDS. Members
  deployed to hazardous duty locations in support of national defense strategy and filling
  mobility positions subject to deployment may require small arms equipment and training.
  Members with qualifying convictions may not fill such requirements.

  A3.3.8. Separation of military personnel shall comply with existing statutory military
  retirement sanctuaries (see 10 USC § 1176(a) (regular and reserve members); 10 USC §
  637(a)(5)(regular officers); 10 USC § 12646(e)(1)(reserve commissioned); 10 USC § 12686
  (reserves on active duty). A military member in any of these sanctuaries who has a
  ―qualifying conviction‖ and would otherwise be separated under this policy shall be given
  meaningful duties that do not entail access to firearms or ammunition until they are retired
  upon first attaining eligibility.
  A3.3.9. Members who have a qualifying conviction who are residing in military-provided
  housing on a military installation will lawfully dispose of all privately owned fire arms and
  ammunition immediately. Military members not residing on a military installation are
  legally required to do the same.
  A3.3.10. FSSs and MWR functions will not permit anyone (including employees and
  customers) access to firearms, destructive devices, and/or ammunition (as defined in the
  attached list of key terms) unless the person has completed a DD Form 2760 certifying they
  have not been convicted of a qualifying crime of domestic violence.
  A3.3.11. If a completed security clearance investigation reveals that a military member has a
  qualifying conviction; the investigation shall be referred to the individual’s commander for
  action consistent with this policy.
  A3.3.12. This policy, and related policies referencing this memorandum, apply outside the
  territory of the US as a matter of policy. The DoD has construed the Lautenberg Amendment
  as inapplicable to major military weapon systems or ―crew served‖ military weapons and
  ammunition (tanks, missiles, aircraft, etc.).

   exceptional cases for otherwise highly qualified applicants whose pre-service drug use was
   limited in frequency and scope, experimental in nature, and unlikely to recur.
A4.2. Part II - Pre-Service Drug Use.
   A4.2.1. Pre-service marijuana use is a bar to enlistment (a waiver is not permitted) when an

      any component of the armed forces) does not require a waiver. The Director of Personnel
      will review all available information concerning prior marijuana use and may determine
      that selection of an individual for enlistment or appointment into a specific skill is not in
      the best interest of the ANG. When considering enlistment of an applicant into a specific

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND PREPARATION OF DD FORM 4, ENLISTMENT OR
        REENLISTMENT DOCUMENT ARMED FORCES OF THE US

A9.1. Use of DD Form 4. For initial enlistments or reenlistments in the ANG.
A9.2. Preparation of DD Form 4:
   A9.2.1. The DD Form 4 is prepared electronically or by typewriter. All signatures required
   will be made with ballpoint pen in dark ink. For electronically generated forms (AFRISS,
   Form flow, etc.), original signatures are mandatory on the first/original DD Form 4. Copies
   may be made; however, FSS personnel must certify every page of each copy as an original
   copy.
   A9.2.2. As the basic document establishing a legal relationship between the US Government
   and the enlisted member, special care will be taken to ensure that all items are completed
   correctly without typewriter strikeovers.
       A9.2.2.1. Any erasures or corrections will be initialed by the enlistee and the service
       representative. Erasures are not permitted in the DOE, term of service, or confirmation
       of enlistment sections.       Errors in these sections will necessitate complete
       reaccomplishment of the agreement.
       A9.2.2.2. Errors discovered after the member's enlistment will be corrected as follows:
          A9.2.2.2.1. There are two types of erroneous reenlistment documents. The first
          consists of contractual errors made in violation of this publication, such as the
          reenlistment of ineligible airmen. Only NGB/A1P authorizes correction of
          contractual errors. The second is administrative, involving typographical errors,
          strikeovers, misspellings, etc.
              A9.2.2.2.1.1. Contractual Errors. The FSS processes a case file to NGB/A1P.
              Include a signed memorandum from the airman outlining the facts of the situation
              and the airman's desires, and the unit commander's and FSS Superintendent’s (or
              designated representative's) comments and recommendations. NGB/A1P resolves
              each case in the ANG's best interest and will either declare the contract valid or
              erroneous and without effect. Airmen may petition the AFBCMR if they don't
              agree with the final decision.
              A9.2.2.2.1.2. Administrative Errors. The FSS may correct administrative errors
              discovered in any block of the DD Forms 4 if the airman and commander agree.
              The FSS will process case files according to Paragraph A9.2.2.2.1.1 when there
              is disagreement. If the airman and commander agree, the FSS make corrections
              on all copies of the forms before distribution, or on the ARMS copies after
              distribution. Only remove those pages from ARMS requiring correction, not the
              entire set. Don't reaccomplish the DD Forms 4. The airman and FSS
              representatives must initial each correction. If the corrections were made on the
              ARMS copy of the forms, type Corrected Copy in the upper margin of the
              corrected pages, make a photo copy of the corrected forms and file the photo copy
              in ARMS. The FSS corrects PDS and if applicable.

          A9.2.2.3. If an enlistment/reenlistment waiver was required, attach to the DD Form 4,
          and add in the remarks section that there is a waiver attached.

                                        waivers shall be documented there regardless of when
                                        they were approved.
                                        (i.) Conduct Waivers. Report only the most severe
                                        waiver. For example, if an applicant has a conviction
                                        for a major misconduct offense and three misconduct
                                        offenses, report these only as a ―major misconduct‖
                                        waiver; however, all offenses should be considered

                                   same as those married to a civilian; however, the
                                   Services may be more restrictive in their requirements
                                   concerning this issue and may require a Service
                                   review.

                                   individuals with a positive DAT result.
                                   (iv.) Medical Waivers. Multiple waivers are allowed
                                   for different medical conditions. Attachment 11 lists
                                   the appropriate codes for medical conditions requiring
                                   a waiver. If the waiver codes are identified by two
                                   different codes, report the two as two waivers; if they
                                   are not, report them as one. For example, if an
                                   applicant receives a waiver for hearing (HCA) and for
                                   height (HAA), both codes should be entered. If an
                                   applicant receives a waiver for hearing (HCA) and a
                                   heart murmur (HCA), only one code should be
