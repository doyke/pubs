Inspector General (IG) Complaint System and Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Program
1. The Inspector General Complaint Program is described in AF1 90-301. This instruction tells you how to make a complaint
and who you should talk to. You may go to an inspector or IG at any level, but experience has shown that complaints are best
solved at the lowest level by supervisors and commanders. For this reason, although not required you are encouraged to discuss
you problem with your supervisor or your commander before coming to the IG.

2. The Air Force has a good complaint program. You can get help quickly and fairly when you ask a question. You can make
your complaint at any level in the IG system and you do not have to worry about being intimidated when you ask for help. You
can seek counsel with the Inspector without fear of harassment or repercussions from your unit. No one may take a wrong
action against you just because you complained. If you think a wrong action was taken against you just because you
complained, tell an inspector or an IG.

3. Some matters are not taken care of in the IG Complaints Program. These are matters where there is a way to get help under
other directives. The table below shows, by subject, the procedure you must use. When one of these procedures fits your
problem, you may not use the IG Complaint Program. This table does not list all the types of complaints that are handled by
other appeal channels.

4. If a policy, directive or instruction provides a specific means of problem resolution or appeal, you should exhaust those
avenues first. You must be able to allege that a process was mishandled or handled prejudicially before the IG office will
process your complaint. Mere dissatisfaction with the solution to a specific problem or the outcome of an appeal is not
sufficient justification for an IG investigation.
