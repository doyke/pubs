Section C—ALSE MAINTENANCE AND CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS

3. Aircraft-Installed ALSE Procedures. ALSE must be handled with care to avoid damage to
this life sustaining equipment. Prepositioning equipment IAW this publication allows flexibility
while the aircraft is away from home-station and standardizes ALSE configurations Air Force-
wide. The applicable MDS configuration tables within this publication establish minimum
equipment requirements. In AETC flying units where AMC is the lead command, units are
authorized to load aircraft with only the ALSE required to meet mission requirements.
Additionally, AETC Operations Group Commanders (or equivalent) will ensure an operational
risk management assessment is accomplished regarding utilization of ALSE to safely support
mission requirements. In the event installed ALSE comes due while the aircraft is on alert status
or away from home-station, place these items on a red dash until the aircraft goes off alert or
returns to home-station. When aircraft is removed from alert status or returns to home-station,
upgrade to a red X, keeping within the provisions of T.O. 00-20-1.
     3.1. C-5 ALSE:
        3.1.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-5 Operations
        Configuration and Mission Planning and T.O. 1C-5A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-
        5A and C-5B Airplanes. Aircraft commanders (AC) may request additional equipment be
        positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required.
        However, units will ensure they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per
        applicable allowance standards (AS).

NOTE:
   1. Part number (P/N) 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred
   smoke and fume protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke masks may be used
   until 358-series oxygen masks and goggles are available.
   2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
   each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for increased
   scheduled PAX loads.
   3. Add parachutes as required by other configuration publications.
   4. The A/C is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one
   LPU for each passenger.

     5. The LPU-10/P LPU is required to integrate with ALSE and is designed for use by aircrew
     personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must
     not be used as a substitute for this LPU.
     6. Survival Vests are required when parachutes are prepositioned aboard aircraft. Survival
     vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or return to
     duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.
     7. Aircraft flying overwater to Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) will load one 25-
     person life raft, five LPU-10/Ps, and five anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as
     required.
     8. For all aircraft transfers, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW permanent transfer
     configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, to include PDM aircraft, will contact the
     losing organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE
     and inspection records. Gaining ALS organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance
     inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their
     respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the required
     equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from on-hand
     assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment installed.
     9. Units are authorized to use the Multifab Survival Limited (MSL) quick-don anti-exposure
     suit as a substitute for the CWU-16/P.

NOTE:
   1. P/N 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and fume
   protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke masks may be used until 358-series
   oxygen masks and goggles are available. Smoke masks will not be placed on the flight deck.
   2. Four PBEs will be placed on the flight deck and two in the cargo compartment.
   3. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum,
   each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned flight altitude.
   Preposition additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads. POKs may be used as a

  substitute until EPOS is available; however, mixing of EPOS and POKs on the same aircraft
  is not authorized. If POKs are used, provide one POK for each occupant IAW AFI 11-202,
  Volume 3, General Flight Rules. EPOS or POKs are not required when flying local training
  missions and passengers are not aboard aircraft.
  4. Parachutes, ML-4 survival kits, and survival vests are required on all missions.
  Exception: Refer to note 7 for ML-4 survival kits. A minimum of one parachute, survival
  kit and vest, and anti-exposure suit per crewmember will be prepositioned aboard the aircraft
  during increased scheduled crew loads. Place additional parachutes for airdrop missions, as
  required.
  5. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU. Preposition additional LPUs to meet increased
  scheduled PAX loads. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each passenger.
  LPU-10/P LPUs are a suitable substitute for the A/C LPU for passenger use until A/C LPUs
  are available. If LPU-10/P LPUs are used, AC or designated aircrew representative will
  ensure these LPUs are pre-fitted to passengers prior to take off.
  6. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
  personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must
  not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.
  7. Only required on designated overwater flights. Quantities will match quantities of
  parachutes aboard aircraft.
  8. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue
  or return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.
  9. Only required on designated overwater flights.
  10. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, five LPU-10/P LPUs,
  and five anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.
  11. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW
  permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM aircraft,
  will contact the losing organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-
  installed ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organization will conduct an
  aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment
  shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less
  than the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages
  from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
  12. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the
  CWU-16/P.
  3.5. C-141 ALSE:
     3.5.1. Configure aircraft and position PAX masks for each aircraft configuration IAW
     AFI 11-2C-141, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-141 Operations Configuration/Mission
     Planning, and T.O. 1C-141B-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-141 Aircraft. Configure
     each C-141 with an applicable number of PAX masks as missions dictate. ACs may
     request additional equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and

   substitute for these LPUs.
   6. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue
   or return to duty.
   7. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW
   permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM aircraft,
   will contact the losing organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-
   installed ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organization will conduct an
   aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment
   shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less
   than the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages
   from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
   8. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the
   CWU-16/P.
   3.7. C/KC-135 ALSE:
       3.7.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 3, Addenda A, C/KC-135
       Aircraft Configuration, T.O. 1C-135(K)R-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-135R
       Aircraft, and T.O. 1C-135(K)E(II)-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-135E Aircraft.
       3.7.2. Attach survival kits to parachute buckles and hang in the rear of the aircraft. ACs
       may direct repositioning of ALSE based on mission requirements; however, ALSE must
       be readily accessible for bailout. Crewmembers should return parachutes, kits, and ALSE
       to their primary position after mission completion. ACs may request additional
       equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger
       increases, as required. However, units will ensure they do not exceed their total
       equipment authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).
       3.7.3. Live-Aboard Accommodations.
AFI11-301V2_439AWSUP_I 3 JANUARY 2012                                                            19


           3.7.3.1. Units will establish aircraft live-aboard capability consisting of live-aboard
           kits (LAK), 3 cases of cold weather (CW) or 4 cases of meal-ready-to-eat rations and
           1,800 ounces of water as a minimum IAW AMCI 10-450, Volume 3, Aircraft
           Performance Factors (classified). This will allow aircrew to reside on the aircraft for
           a minimum of three days at forward operating locations in support of OPLAN 8044.
           LAK components are listed in this publication (see ). Not applicable to AETC and
           AFMC.
           3.7.3.2. Each organization (supporting OPLAN 8044) will have sufficient LAKs
           (plus spares) for all PAI aircraft. ALS will build LAKs using A-3 bags, A-21 canvas
           containers, or equivalent. Inner containers should be assembled with rigid reinforced
           fiberboard boxes or equivalent. Inspect kits and contents annually. Document AFTO
           Form 338, Survival Kit Record, as required. Attach a DD Form 1574 to the A-3
           bags or A-21 canvas containers, annotating date inspected and date due next
           inspection.
           3.7.3.3. Requirements for subsistence items are shared responsibilities among ALS
           (delivery, uploading, and downloading), Operations and Plans (quantify as per
           mission needs), and Services (commissary liaison, approval agency, and
           memorandum of understanding [MOU]). Representatives from these organizations
           will establish a MOU. The MOU will specify and define responsibilities for
           forecasting, funding, requisitioning, storing, and issuing rations to best meet the
           wing’s mission. Responsibilities for subsistence rations and water are contained in
           AFI 25-101, War Reserve Material (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. Due
           to the lack of proper refrigerated storage facilities within ALS facilities, some rations
           will require courtesy storage at appropriate facilities.
           3.7.3.4. During live-aboard conditions, carbon monoxide detectors are required for
           all models of KC-135 aircraft.

NOTES:
        1.   P/N 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and
             fume protection for aircrew personnel. However, firefighters smoke mask will be
             used until 358-series oxygen masks and goggles and PBEs are updated in T.O. 1C-
             135A-6, Aircraft Scheduled Inspections and Maintenance Requirements.
        2.   EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a
             minimum, each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned
AFI11-301V2_439AWSUP_I 3 JANUARY 2012                                                      21


           flight altitude. Preposition additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads.
           POKs may be used as a substitute until EPOS is available; however, mixing of
           EPOS and POKs on the same aircraft is not authorized. If POKs are used, provide
           one POK for each occupant IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Preposition one EPOS or
           POK per maintenance personnel during PDM input.
      3.   MIL-G-635 goggles will be uploaded as sets, and placed above the NAV table, to
           back-fill for missing or defective sets of EEU-series goggles.
      4.   The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft
           will have one LPU for each passenger.
      5.   LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by
           aircrew personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and
           survival vests and must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs. Altus AFB is
           only required to preposition LPU-10/P LPUs during routine trainer missions.
      6.   DELETE
      7.   Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items on the ground
           while waiting for rescue or return to duty.
      8.   LAKs are not required to be uploaded on aircraft when OPLAN 8044 crews are
           issued “A” and “B” mobility bags during processing.
      9.   For live-aboard accommodations, refer to paragraph 3.7.3.
      10. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, and four LPU-
          10/P. IAW Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 135 Section 135.98, Operation
          in the Polar Area and FAR Part 121, Appendix P, Requirements for ETOPS and
          Polar Operations, place at least two anti-exposure suits onboard aircraft for
          missions operating above 78 degrees North latitude and below 60 degrees South
          latitude.
      11. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft
          IAW permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferring aircraft, including
          PDM aircraft, will contact the losing organization ALS section and initiate transfer
          of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS
          organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of
          discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM in
          accordance with T.O. 00-20-1, section V. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the
          required equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages
          from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
      12. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for
          the CWU-16/P.

      kits at each unit will be maintained ready at all times. If the AECM support kit capability
      goes below the 75% level, the unit will immediately notify HQ AMC/DOT in writing.
      The notification must include a detailed analysis of the problem and a projected get-well
      date.
      3.10.3. Once built, MAJCOMs may authorize ALS sections maintaining AECM support
      kits to seal and place the kits in serviceable storage inspection status and inspect on an
      annual basis if time-change items’ expiration dates permit. Upon notification of the need
      to deploy the AECM support kits, the ALS section will inspect the kit and place each
      item on a normal inspection cycle and deliver the kits to the designated organization
      within 24 hours.

MAINTENANCE AND CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS FOR AIRCREW AND
AIRCRAFT-INSTALLED LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (LSE)

30 SEPTEMBER 2003

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change converts AFI 11-302, Volume 1 to AFI 11-301, Volume 2, re-titles the publication,
and transfers the OPR from HQ USAF/XOOP to HQ USAF/XOOT. It rescinds paragraph 3.10.1
through 3.10.6, and provides improved policy for equipping aeromedical evacuation (AE)
crewmembers (AECM) during deployment operations. It establishes a new basis of issue (BOI)
for AE crewmembers (Table 11), joins AE LSE with AE kits (UTC FFQDM) (paragraph
3.10.1), identifies units to maintain AECM support kits (paragraph 3.10.2), establishes Civil
Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) support kits (paragraph 3.10.4), and identifies medical logistics
contact information (paragraph 3.10.5 and Table 13). This change also deletes the requirement
for MB-1 casualty life preserver units to be prepositioned aboard aircraft to accommodate
patients, C-141 units to maintain 250 passenger (PAX) masks, and C-130 units to maintain 5
passenger oxygen kits (POK) for AE kits. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2003-1,
for the complete IC. A star (H) indicates revision from the previous edition.

Supercedes: AFI 11-302, Vol 1, 1 October 1999
Certified By: HQ USAF/XOO (Brig Gen Teresa M. Peterson)
3.10.1. ALS units, when supporting AE missions and aircrew, will build and maintain the
equipment listed in Table 11. The equipment will be placed in kits assigned to, and deployed
with, an AE in-flight kit (UTC FFQDM). Each ALS unit supporting an AE squadron will
maintain a minimum of 2 AE ALS kits (Table 11) for WRM. Exception: PACAF and USAFE
ALS squadrons supporting AE operations will build and maintain eight (8) kits. Individual
MAJCOMs will direct what units will maintain for local training and operational missions.
3.10.2. Travis, McGuire and Charleston AFBs will maintain the number of AECM support kits
listed in Table 12. Seventy five percent (75%) of the total number of AECM support kits at each
unit will be maintained ready at all times. If the AECM support kit capability goes below the
75% level, the unit will immediately notify HQ AMC/DOT in writing. The notification must
include a detailed analysis of the problem and a projected get-well date.
3.10.3. Once built, MAJCOMs may authorize ALS sections maintaining AECM support kits to
seal and place the kits in serviceable storage inspection status and inspect on an annual basis if
time-change items’ expiration dates permit. Upon notification of the need to deploy the AECM
support kits, the ALS section will inspect the kit and place each item on a normal inspection
cycle and deliver the kits to the designated organization within 24 hours.

NOTE:
1. Cabin/Cargo Area Aircrews will use the EPOS already prepositioned on the aircraft for
emergency oxygen requirements for preplanned flights up to flight level 350 (FL350). For
preplanned flights above FL350, all AE aircrew must have a quick-don mask with goggles
attached (paragraph 3.11.1. ) to a walk-around bottle available for use.
2. Medical crew director (MCD) and charge medical technician (CMT) must have
communication capability in their quick-don mask.
3. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or
return to duty. The Air Ace™/Ace Advantage™ [Air Advantage™] (paragraph 4.) is the
primary integrated survival vest and aircrew body armor for AE Squadron personnel. The SRU-
21/P is also authorized (paragraph 4.3). AE Squadron personnel are authorized to request
assigned equipment for unit training events.
4. Required for preplanned overwater flights only.
5. CWU-16/P or MAJCOM approved equivalent IAW T.O. 1-1-641.

3.10.4. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Missions. All AE aircrews flying on CRAF aircraft are
exempt from having to use the ALS equipment in Table 11, except for the 358-series quick-don
mask. These masks are required for protection from smoke and fumes and emergency
decompressions. Travis and Charleston AFBs will maintain twelve (12) and thirteen (13) kits
respectively, containing seven (7) each LPU-6/P infant cot life preservers and eleven (11) each
EPOS to support AE CRAF missions. These CRAF support kits will only be mobilized to
support CRAF AE operations.
3.10.5. Table 13 lists contact information for each hub location’s medical logistics area
controlling the medical portion of the FFQDM kit. Each ALS section at AE hub locations will
contact and establish a local notification and delivery plan of the ALS portion of the kits to the
medical logistics office (paragraph 3.10.3). Once coordinated, forward the local plan to HQ
AMC/DOTL and send an info copy to HQ USAF/XOOT. Include these plans in the next review
or revision of the unit’s operating instructions or local directives.

1.1. Supplements. Major Commands (MAJCOM) with these or similar types of MDS aircraft
will supplement this publication to meet their specific mission requirements and identify
equipment inspection and maintenance frequencies, as required IAW AFI 33-360, Volume 1.
Due to Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC),
and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) mission, HQ AETC/DOYL, HQ
AFMC/A3V, and HQ AFSOC/A3TL will establish requirements to meet mission needs and is
authorized to determine unique requirements for assigned aircraft.

2.1. Commanders. Ensure all crewmembers and passengers wear or have access to the
appropriate ALSE for the route of flight and duration of the mission. Commercially procured
items are not authorized for use without prior approval or safe-to-fly recommendation by the
respective ALSE Single Manager and MAJCOM ALS office of primary responsibility IAW AFI
11-301, Volume 1.

2.2.2. Store, handle, service, and account for items part of the 412A aircrew life support system.

2.2.3. Ensure all ALSE inspections remain current throughout the scheduled mission duration.
Ensure aircraft ALSE will have a minimum of 60 days remaining on its current repack and
inspection when departing home-station for tanker task force operations, integrated tanker unit
deployments (ITUD), and 30 days for channel missions, business efforts, aircraft transfers, etc.
Transfer aircraft IAW T.O. 00-20-1, Preventive Maintenance Program General Policy
Requirements and Procedures.

2.2.7. Maintain applicable flight simulator ALSE. MAJCOMs will specify frequency and
procurement procedures as agreed upon.

2.2.8. Permanently preposition ALSE to the maximum extent possible at all times to provide
mission flexibility, especially when aircraft is away from home-station. This will reduce
excessive handling and damage of ALSE. Prepare AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support
Equipment in duplicate. Maintain a file of the original and completed AFTO Forms 46 by
aircraft tail number for all assigned aircraft for historical purposes.

2.2.9. ALS personnel are not responsible for storing, handling, servicing, or accountability of the
following items: thermos jugs, fire extinguishers, aircraft portable O2 cylinders, pre-breather O2

2.2.11. MAJCOMs authorizing use of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) items unrelated to the
412A aircrew life support system, will ensure technical order guidance or commercial manuals
are provided to units to assure COTS items are properly maintained IAW AFI 63-1201.

Section C—ALSE MAINTENANCE AND CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS

3. Aircraft-Installed ALSE Procedures. ALSE must be handled with care to avoid damage to
this life sustaining equipment. Prepositioning equipment IAW this publication allows flexibility
while the aircraft is away from home-station and standardizes ALSE configurations Air Force-
wide. The applicable MDS configuration tables within this publication establish minimum
equipment requirements. In AETC flying units where AMC is the lead command, units are
authorized to load aircraft with only the ALSE required to meet mission requirements.
Additionally, AETC Operations Group Commanders (or equivalent) will ensure an operational
risk management assessment is accomplished regarding utilization of ALSE to safely support
mission requirements. In the event installed ALSE comes due while the aircraft is on alert status
or away from home-station, place these items on a red dash until the aircraft goes off alert or
returns to home-station. When aircraft is removed from alert status or returns to home-station,
upgrade to a red X, keeping within the provisions of T.O. 00-20-1.

3.1. C-5 ALSE:

3.1.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-5 Operations
Configuration and Mission Planning and T.O. 1C-5A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-5A and
C-5B Airplanes. Aircraft commanders (AC) may request additional equipment be positioned
aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. However, units
will ensure they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable allowance
standards (AS).

7. Aircraft flying overwater to Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) will load one 25-person
life raft, five LPU-10/Ps, and five anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.


8. For all aircraft transfers, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW permanent transfer
configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, to include PDM aircraft, will contact the losing
organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and
inspection records. Gaining ALS organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and
forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective
MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the required equipment.
The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from on-hand assets to ensure
transferring aircraft has required equipment installed.


9. Units are authorized to use the Multifab Survival Limited (MSL) quick-don anti-exposure suit
as a substitute for the CWU-16/P.


3.2. C-17 ALSE:

3.2.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-17 Configuration and
Mission Planning and T.O. 1C-17A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-17A Aircraft. Store ALSE
not being used in the survival equipment locker located forward and left of the crew entrance
door. Suspend parachutes from bar with ML-4 survival kits attached to parachute buckles. ALSE
is the only equipment authorized for storage in the C-17 equipment locker. Store personnel
restraint harnesses in the right side drawer under the forward loadmaster station. Crewmembers
should return all ALSE to storage positions after mission completion. Place EPOS in the under-
the-seat pouches per mission directives. ACs may request additional equipment be positioned
aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. However, units

3 EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum, each
aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. Preposition
additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads. POKs may be used as a substitute until
EPOS is available; however, mixing of EPOS and POKs on the same aircraft is not authorized. If
POKs are used, provide one POK for each occupant IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight
Rules. EPOS or POKs are not required when flying local training missions and passengers are
not aboard aircraft.


5. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU. Preposition additional LPUs to meet increased scheduled
PAX loads. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each passenger. LPU-10/P LPUs
are a suitable substitute for the A/C LPU for passenger use until A/C LPUs are available. If LPU-
10/P LPUs are used, AC or designated aircrew representative will ensure these LPUs are pre-
fitted to passengers prior to take off.


6. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must not
be used as a substitute for these LPUs.


8. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or
return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.


10. Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, five LPU-10/P LPUs, and
five anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.
11. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW
permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM aircraft, will
contact the losing organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed
ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance
inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their
respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the required
equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from on-hand assets to
ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
12. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the
CWU-16/P.


3.5. C-141 ALSE:

3.5.1. Configure aircraft and position PAX masks for each aircraft configuration IAW AFI 11-
2C-141, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-141 Operations Configuration/Mission Planning, and T.O.
1C-141B-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-141 Aircraft. Configure each C-141 with an
applicable number of PAX masks as missions dictate. ACs may request additional equipment be
positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required.
AFI11-301V2_439AWSUP_I 3 JANUARY 2012                                                         63

NOTES:

1. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum, each
aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for individual
accommodation kit (IAK) configurations, as required. Preposition one EPOS per maintenance
personnel during PDM input.


3. Preposition additional LPUs for IAKs configurations, as required. As a minimum, each
aircraft will have one LPU for each crewmember and passenger. For IAK configuration,
preposition 80 LPUs.


4. Maintain 4 ea. per IAK or the capability to configure 50% of PAI, whichever is greater.


5. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with survival vests and must not be used as a
substitute for these LPUs.


7. For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW
permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, including PDM aircraft, will
contact the losing organization’s ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed
ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance
inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their
respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the required
equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from on-hand assets to
ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.


8. Units are authorized to use the MSL quick-don anti-exposure suit as a substitute for the CWU-
16/P.

3.7. C/KC-135 ALSE:

3.7.1. Configure aircraft IAW AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 3, Addenda A, C/KC-135 Aircraft
Configuration, T.O. 1C-135(K)R-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-135R Aircraft, and T.O.
1C-135(K)E(II)-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, KC-135E Aircraft.


3.7.2. Attach survival kits to parachute buckles and hang in the rear of the aircraft. ACs may
direct repositioning of ALSE based on mission requirements; however, ALSE must be readily
accessible for bailout. Crewmembers should return parachutes, kits, and ALSE to their primary
position after mission completion. ACs may request additional equipment be positioned aboard
AFI11-301V2_439AWSUP_I 3 JANUARY 2012                                                               67


aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. However, units will ensure
they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per applicable allowance standards (AS).


3.7.3.1. Units will establish aircraft live-aboard capability consisting of live-aboard kits (LAK), 3
cases of cold weather (CW) or 4 cases of meal-ready-to-eat rations and 1,800 ounces of water as
a minimum IAW AMCI 10-450, Volume 3, Aircraft Performance Factors (classified). This will
allow aircrew to reside on the aircraft for a minimum of three days at forward operating locations
in support of OPLAN 8044. LAK components are listed in this publication (see Attachment 4).
Not applicable to AETC and AFMC.

3.7.3.2. Each organization (supporting OPLAN 8044) will have sufficient LAKs (plus spares) for
all PAI aircraft. ALS will build LAKs using A-3 bags, A-21 canvas containers, or equivalent.
Inner containers should be assembled with rigid reinforced fiberboard boxes or equivalent.
Inspect kits and contents annually. Document AFTO Form 338, Survival Kit Record, as
required. Attach a DD Form 1574 to the A-3 bags or A-21 canvas containers, annotating date
inspected and date due next inspection.


3.7.3.3. Requirements for subsistence items are shared responsibilities among ALS (delivery,
uploading, and downloading), Operations and Plans (quantify as per mission needs), and
Services (commissary liaison, approval agency, and memorandum of understanding [MOU]).
Representatives from these organizations will establish a MOU. The MOU will specify and
define responsibilities for forecasting, funding, requisitioning, storing, and issuing rations to best
meet the wing’s mission. Responsibilities for subsistence rations and water are contained in AFI
25-101, War Reserve Material (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. Due to the lack of
proper refrigerated storage facilities within ALS facilities, some rations will require courtesy
storage at appropriate facilities.

1. P/N 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and fume
protection for aircrew personnel. However, firefighters smoke mask will be used until 358-series
oxygen masks and goggles and PBEs are updated in T.O. 1C-135A-6, Aircraft Scheduled
Inspections and Maintenance Requirements.


2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. As a minimum, each
aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. Preposition
additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads. POKs may be used as a substitute until
EPOS is available; however, mixing of EPOS and POKs on the same aircraft is not authorized. If
POKs are used, provide one POK for each occupant IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Preposition
one EPOS or POK per maintenance personnel during PDM input.


3. MIL-G-635 goggles will be uploaded as sets, and placed above the NAV table, to back-fill for
missing or defective sets of EEU-series goggles.


4. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one
LPU for each passenger.


5. LPU-10/P LPUs are required to integrate with ALSE and are designed for use by aircrew
personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must not
be used as a substitute for these LPUs. Altus AFB is only required to preposition LPU-10/P
LPUs during routine trainer missions.


6. The restraint harness is only required for aircraft hatch inspections when parachutes are not
onboard.


7. Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items on the ground while waiting
for rescue or return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.


8. LAKs are not required to be uploaded on aircraft when OPLAN 8044 crews are issued “A”
and “B” mobility bags during processing.


10.Aircraft flying overwater to PDM will load one 20-person life raft, four LPU-10/P LPUs, and
four anti-exposure suits to support crewmembers, as required.


11.For inter- and intra-command transfer of aircraft, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW
permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferring aircraft, including PDM aircraft,
will contact the losing organization ALS section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed
ALSE and inspection records. The gaining ALS organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance

contact and establish a local notification and delivery plan of the ALS portion of the kits to the
medical logistics office (paragraph 3.10.3). Once coordinated, forward the local plan to HQ
AMC/DOTL and send an info copy to HQ USAF/A3OT. Include these plans in the next review
or revision of the unit’s operating instructions or local directives.

3.11.6. Conduct routine inspections of aircraft-installed aircrew oxygen masks (i.e., 358-series,
359-series, AWACS, etc.) on 30-day intervals. Complete disassembly and cleaning inspections
are accomplished every 90-days. MAJCOMs should continue to emphasize oxygen mask
cleanliness and serviceability during postflight, mission termination and routine 30-day mask
inspections. EXCEPTION: Firefighter smoke masks are inspected at intervals IAW T.O. 15X5-
5-3-1, Operation and Maintenance Instructions With Illustrated Parts Breakdown Fire Fighters
and Oxygen Smoke Mask Assemblies.

3.12. Life Rafts:

3.12.1. Position sufficient types of life rafts aboard each aircraft on overwater flights to
accommodate all aircrew and passengers IAW T.O. 14S3-1-3, Type and Number of Individual
Survival Kit Containers and Life Rafts To Be Used In Various Type Aircraft, and applicable
MDS configuration tables. Place additional life rafts aboard aircraft when required. Ensure a DD
Form 1574 is attached to each aircraft life raft and aircraft actuation handles for life rafts
installed in wing well, silos, etc. Ensure the time-change information is annotated on the reverse
side of tag IAW T.O. 14S-1-102. C-141 units will maintain additional life rafts IAW the
allowance standard (AS 016) for contingencies.

3.12.2. The Air Cruisers Company AC-9 (9-person) life raft received a safe-to-fly
recommendation from the ALSE Single Manager. Units are authorized to use the AC-9 as a
substitute for the T-9AF or LRU-14-series life rafts.

3.13.1. The A/C LPU is the preferred LPU for aircrew and passengers during normal ditching
situations. Units should pursue replacement of LPU-10/P LPUs for passenger use. The A/C LPU
does not require pre-fitting prior to flight and is easier to don during emergency situations. As a
minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each passenger during overwater flights. C-141
units will maintain additional LPUs IAW AS 016 for contingencies.

3.13.2. The LPU-10/P LPUs are required and are designed to integrate with ALSE.
Crewmembers wearing parachutes, survival vests, anti-exposure suits, and aircrew chemical
defense equipment must use these LPUs during bailout or ditching. A/C LPUs are not
compatible for use with ALSE and must not be used as a substitute for these LPUs.

3.14. Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE). Units will utilize PBEs, P/N 802300-14, with
the fire retardant polyethylene (green) storage container, P/N 803753-01, and neoprene neck
seal. PBE P/N 802300-14 is considered the primary device. Units may still utilize Emergency
Escape Breathing Devices (EEBD), P/N 802300-11, until item’s service-life expires. Units will
not substitute above items with PBE, P/N 802300-01, with the polyethylene (daglo orange)
container and urethane neck seal. ALS personnel should limit how often the PBEs or EEBDs are
removed from or installed into the container to reduce wear-and-tear on the vacuum-sealed bag.
AFI11-301V2_439AWSUP_I 3 JANUARY 2012                                                               75


PBEs or EEBDs will remain in their original "hard" carrying case to provide fire and puncture-
proof protection.

3.14.1. PBEs are the primary devices used to locate and extinguish an in-flight fire, and afford
aircrew the required protection IAW Federal Aviation Regulation Section 121.337, Protective
Breathing Equipment, and technical standard orders (TSO) C99, Protective Breathing
Equipment, and TSO-C116, Crewmember Protective Breathing Equipment.

3.15.1. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. POKs may be
used, as suitable substitutes for EPOS until EPOS is available. For C-130s and C/KC-135s,
preposition POKs at passenger positions. Secure the POK on the upper seat support tube using a
tie-down strap (NSN 5975-00-984-6582 or equivalent) and a quick release snap (i.e., FASTTEX
buckle, P/N SR1, or equivalent). Position the POK bags to the forward side of the passenger and
between the seat back webbing to ensure rapid access. Ensure caution tag and retainer pin is
removed when POKs are prepositioned on aircraft. For KC-135 aircraft, position three EPOS or
POKs aboard aircraft: one in the latrine, one in the cockpit, and one at the galley. AETC students
are allowed to preposition POKs, as required.

3.15.2. EPOS is the preferred passenger oxygen, smoke, and fume protection. POKs may be
used, as suitable substitutes for EPOS until EPOS is available. For C-130s and C/KC-135s,
preposition POKs at passenger positions.

4. Survival Vest and Aircrew Body Armor:
4.1. During contingency missions, permanently prepositioned the integrated Air Ace™/Ace
Advantage™ [Air Advantage™] survival vest and aircrew body armor (on all aircraft as
indicated in the applicable MDS configuration tables. A trademark of Survival Incorporated. C-
17, C-130, KC-10, and KC-135 aircraft will have survival vests prepositioned aboard aircraft at
all times.

4.4.2. Stencil each container with at least 1-inch letters (all caps) on ends to read as follows:

6.3. The Multifab Survival Limited (MSL) quick-don anti-exposure suit received a safe-to-fly
recommendation from the ALSE Single Manager. Units are authorized to use the MSL as a
substitute for the CWU-16/P.

8.1. PCKs contain protective clothing for use by aircrew during emergencies aboard aircraft
carrying hazardous cargo IAW Air Force Joint Manual (AFJMAN) 24-204, Preparing
Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. Each PCK will contain the components listed
in this publication (see Attachment 9). Units may build kits IAW AFJMAN 24-204 or purchase
commercial kits meeting or exceeding AFJMAN 24-204 requirements. Units should contact base
environmental or fire protection personnel to determine adequacy of commercial kits being
considered.

10.2. Personnel parachutes will be equipped with emergency locator beacons, automatic releases,
emergency bailout oxygen cylinders, hook-blade knives, oxygen connector brackets, AFP 64-15,
Survival and Emergency Uses of the Parachute (will convert to Air Force Pamphlet [AFPAM]
36-2242), Survival Kit (SRU-16/P), and personnel lowering devices (PLD). The installation of
PLDs is at the discretion of each MAJCOM.

10.2.1. DELETED.

10.3. Flying helmets are required for bailout and aircrew performing air defense system
missions. Helmets will be carried on all missions requiring parachutes or anytime personnel
parachutes are prepositioned aboard aircraft (not applicable when carrying passengers). Flying
helmets must be used in conjunction with the parachute to avoid head injuries. Unless otherwise
directed in the AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3 series publications for mission requirements. In
addition, flight helmets are required whenever the aircrew requires night vision devices (NVD)
and flash-blindness devices (MIL-G-635 or EEU-series goggles). Additionally, helmets will be
retained for aircrew wearing aircrew chemical defense equipment that require NVDs plus flash-
blindness devices to perform their mission in a contaminated environment.

12.1. The AC or a designated aircrew representative is responsible for briefing passengers on
emergency equipment before each flight IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, T.O. 14D1-2-1, Personnel
Parachutes, and T.O. 14S-1-102. Passenger-carrying aircraft will have a set of demonstration
ALSE mirroring all onboard individually issued passenger equipment (i.e., LPUs, EPOS, oxygen
masks, etc.). Do not include LPU-6/P LPUs as part of the demonstration kit.

12.2. To keep this equipment segregated from operational assets, store demonstration equipment
in a “red” locally manufactured storage container. Stencil both the storage container and each
piece of ALSE "FOR DEMONSTRATION ONLY" in 1/2-inch black (or contrasting color)
lettering.
