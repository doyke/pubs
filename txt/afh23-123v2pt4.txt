                         SUPPLY MODERNIZATION SUMMARY

Section 1A—- Purpose Of Supply Modernization.

1.1. Chapter Summary. This chapter provides basic information concerning the supply
modernization component of Integrated Logistics System – Supply (ILS-S). It describes the
specific features, access and control.
   1.1.1. Publication supplements. This publication may be supplemented at the MAJCOM
   level or higher, but all supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for
   coordination prior to certification and approval.
Note: In some cases because of system protocols, terminology has not been updated within this
part of AFH 23-123, Vol 2. For example, while the term Defense Logistics Agency Distribution
Service (DLADS) has replaced the term Defense Reutilization & Marketing Office (DRMO), the
older term is still used for operational reference when showing system output. The term has
intentionally not been updated because system users will encounter the older terminology in their
interaction with SBSS.
1.2. Overview.
   1.2.1. Section Summary. This section describes the Air Force Supply Central Database
   (AFSCDB) component and outlines the features and capabilities within the environment.
   The AFSCDB is designed to replicate the SBSS processes without changing its business
   practices.
   1.2.2. Purpose of modernization. The modernization project enhances the SBSS legacy
   system by leveraging available technologies, tools, and methodologies. It provides access to
   SBSS data at an enterprise level for supply users while reducing costs.
   1.2.3. Automated Data Systems. The AFSCDB is hosted on a UNIX server with an Oracle
   relational database. All supply accounts within a single database schema providing enhanced
   asset visibility with reduced user accounts. Main supply transaction processing continues to
   use the SBSS legacy system however the ad-hoc feature of the AFSCDB is the preferred
   report generation method. The modernized database and the SBSS secondary are derived
   from the same source data produced during end of day crossover.
1.3. ILS-S Features and Capabilities.
   1.3.1. The AFSCDB successfully combines all SBSS databases into a single relational
   database contained within a single schema, providing Air Force-wide data access and
   visibility. The Oracle relational database operates concurrently with the SBSS secondary
   reports database. In essence the supply community has three databases supporting the
   workload, the Legacy primary (on-line transaction processing), Legacy secondary
   (mandatory reports), and modernized AFSCDB for ad-hoc and as-required reports.
   1.3.2. Oracle Discoverer is the ad-hoc reports generation tool that provides user-defined
   query capability. This tool features an End-User Layer, developed and maintained by Supply
 24                                                  AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


   functional experts, which provides a user-friendly environment. Discoverer takes full
   advantage of the Oracle relational database and permits users to create queries combining
   multiple accounts and record types into a single view using point and click technologies.

Section 1B—- ILS-S Controls.

1.4. Controls.
   1.4.1. Physical Security. Personal computers must follow normal physical security
   requirements and property protection policies IAW Air Force Systems Security Instructions
   (AFSSI)                8502,               Computer          Security            reference
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/users/request.asp?Filter=OO-SC-CA-11 to access this
   issuance. ILS-S does not address this requirement and defers users to their communications
   security specialist for specific guidance.
   1.4.2. Access Control.      Access to the AFSCDB requires a database account and
   administration of the account is handled using a tiered admin approach. Specifics about
   access can be found in 1.4.3. Access Security. ILS-S utilizes existing security of SBSS IAW
   the System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA). ILS-S hardware security resources
   will operate in accordance with approved Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
   security requirements, and evolve to the C2 level security requirements IAW DoDD
   8500.01E, Information Assurance .

                                           Chapter 2

                                 ACCESS AND SECURITY

Section 2A—- Purpose and Overview.

2.1. Chapter Summary. This Chapter focuses on the how to access the new AFSCDB
environment and the security measures in place to secure supply data from unauthorized users. It
is important to note that the methods, policy, and procedures described in this section are
independent of the SBSS environment. This chapter describes how to sign on, the security
methods in place, and the role of the User Administrator.
2.2. Overview.
   2.2.1. Section 2A. Overview, provides an overview of the chapter and outlines the
   remaining chapters describing the different methods of access and the controls, security in
   place within the AFSCDB environment, and the new role of the User Administrator.
   2.2.2. Section 2B. Sign On and Access, concentrates on the different environments the user
   must successfully access and what level of data visibility individual users may be granted.
   2.2.3. Section 2C. Security, outlines the Air Force policy on password administration and
   the methods in place by AFSCDB to protect supply data.
   2.2.4. Section 2D. User Administrator, defines the role and responsibilities of a new
   position created within the supply community to manage and account for new users to
   AFSCDB.

Section 2B—- Sign On And Access.

2.3. . This section outlines the need for two separate sign on environments and the various
levels of data access that may be granted individual users. This section also defines the user
identification structure that must be followed when assigning new users to AFSCDB.
   2.3.1. Two Accounts, One System. Because of the complexity of the AFSCDB system and
   the various applications used in its configuration, a web graphical user interface screen was
   designed to serve as a front-end navigator. When a customer signs onto to AFSCDB they
   will actually sign into their web account. If they are an authorized user they will have access
   and visibility to their Oracle account menu options based on their access permissions.
   2.3.2. Seamless Sign-On. Although the user must sign on to two systems, only one user
   identification name and password will be used. Your web account and Oracle account user
   identification will be identical and only the Oracle account will be password-protected.
2.4. Web Access.
   2.4.1. A user must have a web account established to view the AFSCDB graphical user
   interface sign in screen. Without an established web account a user is considered an
   unauthorized user and will not proceed beyond the sign-on screen
   2.4.2. Once a user successfully signs on the user is presented a menu page. This menu page
   provides links to the various applications and features available to AFSCDB users. This
 26                                                      AFH23-123V2PT4           8 AUGUST 2013


   front-end module will grow as more features are added but the basic format will remain the
   same.
   2.4.3. The options that appear on the menu screen may only be activated and called upon if
   the user has permissions to use the application / feature. If the user has not been granted
   permissions to use the area by the User Administrator then the menu option will not open the
   application.
2.5. Oracle Access.
   2.5.1. In addition to the web account a user must be established in Oracle. This user account
   is different from the web account in that it actually resides on the AFSCDB. Without this
   Oracle account the web account is useless.
   2.5.2. The Oracle account is what actually permits the user to access the supply data and
   grants permissions to other applications and features within the AFSCDB environment. As
   more capabilities are added or as users’ requirements change, the User Administrator will
   adjust individual user Oracle account to Add, Delete, or Change as required.
   2.5.3. Oracle takes advantage of approved Air Force password security policy (outlined in
   section 2C). In the event you are locked out of the system due to password violations you
   will not be granted access until your User Administrator unlocks your account. Contact your
   User Administrator for more details.
2.6. Access Levels and Permissions.
   2.6.1. The design of the AFSCDB permits a user to access some or all accounts.
   Accessibility to these accounts is based on the permissions granted to a user by the User
   Administrator at the time of user creation.
   2.6.2. The decision of account access should be based on the type of work a user performs
   and if there is a genuine need to view multiple accounts. The number of people granted full
   Air Force level views should be limited to those that need it in the performance of their
   duties.
   2.6.3. All accounts are controlled and accessed by the Stock Record Account Number
   (SRAN). A user may be limited to a single SRAN or given access to multiple SRANS. The
   distinct advantage of this is that the user may now retrieve data from multiple SRANS with a
   single integration request.
   2.6.4. In addition to accessing different accounts it is also possible to limit what applications
   may be used by an individual. The User Administrator will activate and deactivate which
   applications a user needs in the performance of their duties. Based on this selection the
   application may be accessed from the web account main menu.
2.7. User Identification Structure.
   2.7.1. To assist in user profiling, user analysis, report authoring, user base reconciliation, and
   user account information, there is a standard format to follow when creating new users to
   AFSCDB. All User Administrators will follow the guidance outlined below when creating a
   new user identification name to AFSCDB.
   2.7.2. User Identification Naming Conventions:
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                    27


       2.7.2.1. Position 1-2 Site Identification Code
       2.7.2.2. Position 3-4 Major Command Code
       2.7.2.3. Position 5-8 Unique identifier determined by responsible User Administrator
       (see User Administrator for detailed information)

Section 2C—- Security.

2.8. Overview. AFSCDB operates under the security direction of DoDD 8500.01E. AFSCDB
hardware security resources will operate in accordance with approved DISA security
requirements, and evolve to the C2 level security requirements. AFSCDB has a SSAA on file
and has met the security requirements outlined by the AF Communication community. This
section outlines specific security features that may be of interest to the supply community.
2.9. Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
   2.9.1. All supply traffic passed from the database via AFSCDB will process through a SSL.
   As data is passed through the SSL it becomes 128 bit encrypted providing secure supply data.
   This encrypted data is then passed via the Internet to your Base Network Control Center
   (firewall) where it is then transferred in a readable format to your PC.
   2.9.2. All supply traffic passed from your PC via AFSCDB will process through your BNCC
   where it will receive 128 Bit Encryption and relay through the Internet to the SSL where it is
   captured and passed to the Database.
   2.9.3. This SSL dedicated to the database is located at DISA Oklahoma City and is the
   responsibility of the Database Administrators.
2.10. Password Assignment.
   2.10.1. Each user that receives an Oracle Account must protect their access by means of an
   approved password. The Oracle Password policy differs from the SBSS password policies
   and is more restrictive in its structure. When the User Administrator creates your account
   you will be granted a generic password. Upon your initial sign-on you will be directed to
   change your password. Failure to do so will result in a password failure and lock out of the
   system.
   2.10.2. Physical Security. You are responsible for the physical protection of your password.
   You are prohibited from sharing your password with anyone. You should also memorize
   your password to avoid having it written down. You should always be conscience of those
   around you when you type your password on the keyboard and take other precautions as
   necessary to protect access into our system. It is a violation to leave your terminal open
   (signed on to an active AFSCDB session and you are physically away from your PC). If you
   suspect your password has been compromised, change it with the “Change Oracle Password”
   function and contact your User Administrator.
   2.10.3. AFSCDB passwords take full advantage of the Identification and Authentication
   Procedures outlined in AFSSI 8520. Some of the features employed are:
   2.10.4. Password composition. Use passwords with at least eight alphanumeric characters
   (upper and lower case) with at least one special character (! % # etc.). Never make a
   password related to one’s own personal identity, history, or environment.
   2.10.5. Expiration. Your password will expire at the 90-day point from its creation. You
   will receive a notice from the system at the 80-day point warning you that your password will
   expire in 10 days. You will continue to receive this warning each time you sign on informing

   password in the allotted time frame will result in your account being locked and inaccessible.
   Once a lock out occurs you must contact your User Administrator for assistance.
   2.10.6. Password Library. You are encouraged to create a unique password each and every
   time you establish your password for AFSCDB. A record of your last ten passwords will be
   maintained to prevent you from using the same series of passwords within a six-month
   window. If you attempt to reuse a password that is stored as one of your last ten passwords
   used within the last six months you will be prompted to select another.
   2.10.7. Limited Sign-On Attempts. You must pay diligent attention to the mechanics and
   details of your sign-on routine. You will be permitted 3 attempts to successfully input the
   correct password. When the third attempt to sign-on fails your account will be locked and
   inaccessible. You must contact your User Administrator for assistance.
2.11. Password Administration.
   2.11.1. The AFSCDB User Administrator has the responsibility to manage and administer
   the AFSCDB password program IAW AFSSI 8520 and other security guides as applicable.
   2.11.2. User Lockouts. The AFSCDB system has several security features that will cause a
   user to be locked out and render the account inaccessible. It is the responsibility of the User
   Administrator to validate and authenticate the user before unlocking their account.
   2.11.3. Password Compromise. The User Administrator has the responsibility to change or
   delete a suspected or confirmed compromised password immediately.
   2.11.4. Deleted Accounts. User Administrators must delete active password and password
   history from accounts where the user has transferred to another account or otherwise been
   terminated from the AFSCDB system.
   2.11.5. Suspended System Access. User Administrator must delete active password and
   lock down accounts where the user’s access to the system has been terminated or suspended.

Section 2D—- User Administrator.

2.12. Overview. The AFSCDB is a controlled environment that requires users be granted
access and receive limited privileges within the environment. The role of the User Administrator
was created to serve as trusted agents to grant access rights and permission levels to individual
users. This section outlines the User Administrator appointment process, their duties and
responsibilities, guidelines on creating new users, and general information on audit requirements.
2.13. Appointment.
   2.13.1. MAJCOM Staff. Through coordination with AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations
   Activity each MAJCOM determines at what level they desire to place the responsibility of
   User Administrator within their accounts.
   2.13.2. MAJCOM Level-1 Administrator. Each MAJCOM should appoint a primary and an
   alternate individual to serve as the command level-1 administrators. The command
   representatives must submit an appointment letter, administrator agreement letter and DD
   Form 2875, System Authorization Access Request (SAAR), to AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity level-1 administrator. The appointment and agreement letters must be
   updated annually. A new DD Form 2875 is required for new level-1 administrators. The
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                           39


   necessary appointment and agreement letters can be obtained from the AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity website.
   2.13.3. Level-2 Administrator Appointment. MAJCOM level-1 administrators may mandate
   specific documentation required for their level-2 administrators. At a minimum a DD 2875
   is required for the individual. MAJCOM level-1 administrators may dictate the frequency of
   documentation updates or reviews for level-2 administrators within their command.
2.14. Duties and Responsibilities.
   2.14.1. The primary duty of the User Administrator is the creation of new user accounts
   within the AFSCDB. User Administrators are also charged with updating the user accounts
   when permissions change and deleting accounts when no longer needed.
   2.14.2. It is vital that the User Administrator validate that the new user is, in fact, an
   authorized user of the system and that a record of the account assignment is maintained.
   When a new user requests permission to access the AFSCDB, a DD Form 2875 is used to
   generate the request. The User Administrator must maintain a DD Form 2875 on file for all
   new users and active AFSCDB accounts. This is a mandatory requirement and is vital to
   passing a System Security Audit by DISA.
   2.14.3. User Administrators must follow the approved User Identification format. The last
   four positions are assigned by the individual User Administrators and may be reused as
   determined locally.
   2.14.4. When creating new accounts it will be necessary to identify the level of access the
   new user requires.     The User Administrator must exercise and enforce discipline when
   granting this permission. If the user’s duties do not require access to multiple accounts then
   only grant single SRAN access. This diligence will enhance the performance of the database
   and ensure that those with a valid need have unhindered access to data.
   2.14.5. Each new account must have permissions assigned to it. This means that the User
   Administrator must identify which tools and applications the new user is entitled to access
   and use. Once again care must be taken to ensure those with a need are not encumbered by
   those with a desire. If a person’s job requires them to use reports as a work product then they
   may be content to use Discoverer Viewer or Oracle Reports. However, if the user’s job is to
   troubleshoot and analyze data they may need the full capabilities of Discoverer. It is up to
   the User Administrator to help define the user’s needs and grant privileges to the tools
   needed by the user.
   2.14.6. Reset Passwords As Required. This routine task should be done with extreme
   caution. Keep in mind that it may be possible for an unauthorized user to use a valid user’s
   account to gain access and deliberately lock the account so that he may reset it to one of his
   choosing. A method of validating the user must be accomplished before resetting the
   member’s password.
   2.14.7. Conduct routine internal evaluations and self-inspections on user account
   management to include DD Form 2875 user file. The recommended minimum is annually.
   MAJCOMs may mandate the frequency and requirements of the validation. Administrators
   should validate changes to user information and permissions, inactive accounts for possible
 40                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


   deletion, and non-admin users with more than one account assigned. Administrators should
   utilize a Discoverer query to manage the validation.
2.15. User Creation Policy and Procedures.
   2.15.1. All new user requests must begin with the creation of a DD Form 2875 Enter
   AFSCDB in block 16 for the system to access and identify access privileges SRAN(s) access,
   Database Privilege(s), and Menu Access) in block 19. Also include permissions required by
   the users.
   2.15.2. Only one Oracle account may be granted to a single user.            Multiple account
   assignment is not needed and is not authorized
   2.15.3. It is the individual user’s responsibility to inform the User Administrator when there
   is a valid change in the user account status. Once informed of such a change, the User
   Administrator must adjust as required to fit the needs of the user.
2.16. Access/Authorized User Audits.
   2.16.1. The Supply community has the responsibility to administer its own system access
   and security program. Specific responsibilities include DD Form 2875’s maintained by the
   User Administrators and the compliance of the Identification and Authentication procedures
   outlined in this publication and AFSSI 8520.
   2.16.2. MAJCOM Level-1 administrators must be capable of producing the DD Form 2875
   of all members designated as Level-2 Administrators within their command. Each DD Form
   2875 must accurately reflect the level of permission the User Administrator is capable of
   granting to the user base. They are also responsible for authoring and administering the
   SSAA between AFSCDB and the Communication Security Agency.
   2.16.3. User Administrators must be capable of producing DD Form 2875’s for each
   member granted access to the AFSCDB within their span of control. Each DD Form 2875
   must accurately reflect the access privileges granted and the various permissions accessible
   by the individual user. They are also responsible for complying with the user account
   configuration and password administration.
   2.16.4. DISA may randomly perform a no notice sample audit on accounts. Documentation
   compliance is mandatory. Failure to pass a DISA audit will result in a re-audit within 90
   days and may result in removal as a User Administrator.

Section 2E—- User Management User’s Manual.

2.17. Overview. The User Management is broken down into two main logical sections: New
User Creation and Existing User Management.
   2.17.1. New User Creation. Used to create a new user in the AFSCDB. Actions that occur
   during new user creation include simple functions like inputting initial identification
   information and formally establishing the user on the system. Actions also include more
   advanced functions like assigning initial user data, database, and application access
   privileges.
   2.17.2. Existing User Management. The day-to-day management of AFSCDB users
   previously created. Actions include non-Supply specific actions, like locking/unlocking
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                             41


   accounts, resetting passwords, and killing user sessions. Actions also include Supply specific
   actions, like updating contact information, changing user access privileges, and deleting
   users.
   2.17.3. Each of the above sections, along with associated screens will be discussed in detail
   in the following pages.
2.18. New User Creation.
   2.18.1. New User Creation spans 4 screens:
      2.18.1.1. Screen 1 – Search/Select User
      2.18.1.2. Screen 2 – Initial User Data
      2.18.1.3. Screen 3 – Create User
      2.18.1.4. Screen 4 – Add/Remove User Access Privileges
   2.18.2. Screen 1, Search/Select User.

Figure 2.1. Form Layout.




   2.18.3. The Search/Select User Screen is the first screen a User Administrator encounters.
      2.18.3.1. There are 6 objects on the User Search Screen.
          2.18.3.1.1. Object 1: Input field, “SearchString,” for entering a search string used to
          select user records. The search string can be part or all of any of the following:

First Name                First Name of the User
Note: If the mouse cursor is moved over the label, help text about data entry into the
“SearchString” field is provided.
             2.18.3.1.2. Object 2: Action button, “SearchUserTable,” for initiating a user search
             based on the input.
             2.18.3.1.3. Object 3: Dual purpose, output/input combo box, “Users.”
                2.18.3.1.3.1. In the output mode, it displays 2 types of records. First type is the
                default New User record and will be discussed in detail later. Second type is
                records which result from a user search. Order in which records are displayed is
                as follows:
                    2.18.3.1.3.1.1. By SiteID
                    2.18.3.1.3.1.2. Then By MAJCOM Code
                    2.18.3.1.3.1.3. Then By LastName
                    2.18.3.1.3.1.4. Then By FirstName
                2.18.3.1.3.2. In the input mode, a particular record is selected for further action.
             2.18.3.1.4. Object 4: Main menu Icon, used to return to the AFSCDB main menu
             screen.
             2.18.3.1.5. Object 5: Action button, “SelectUser,” displays information about a
             specific user on Screen 2, or for a new user when the “NewUserAccount” line is
             selected in object 3.
             2.18.3.1.6. Object 6: Output field, “Message:” is for displaying pertinent messages,
             like welcome messages and/or number of records returned from a user search.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                        43

   2.18.4. Steps For Creating a New User.
      2.18.4.1. The first step in creating a new user is to ensure the proposed User Account
      Name has not been previously assigned. This is done by entering the full User Account
      Name in SearchString field. Then click the SearchUserTable Button. For user-id format
      conventions see paragraph above entitled, “User Identification Naming Conventions.”
          2.18.4.1.1. No records should return in the Users combo box (object 3), as well as a
          matching message in Message: field. This is because duplicate account names are not
          allowed. If the account you selected is unassigned you’ll receive the message
          displayed in the Message field on the screen below.
 44                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 2.3. Form Usage.




      2.18.4.2. The next step is to accept the selection of the default NewUserAccount line in
      the Users list Object by clicking on the SelectUser button. This will take you to the
      Initial User Data Screen (Screen 2).

Figure 2.4. Screen 2 – Initial User Data Form Layout.




          2.18.4.2.1. Layout of the Initial User Data Screen is fairly straightforward. There are
          13 objects on the Initial User Data Screen. Objects 1-10 are basic identification data
          fields for a new user and include the following:
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                           45

    10         Confirmed Password                  2
Notes:
1. On-Screen help is provided when the cursor is moved over the label.
2. On-Screen help is provided when the cursor is moved over the label.
3. AFSCDB requires a special character in the password. However, the following special
characters are invalid and will not be accepted by the Oracle Database: Space or Blank, @, $, ^,
&, `, =, +, \, |, :, ', ", /, >, <.
           2.18.4.2.2. Remaining objects are Create User action button, Cancel action button,
           and Message output field.
           2.18.4.2.3. Create User action button - displays the “Create User” screen (Screen 3)
           after entry of the user information entered in Fields 1-10.
           2.18.4.2.4. Cancel action button - returns to the “Search/Select User” screen, (Screen
           1). When Screen 1 comes up from a Cancel on this screen, no prior search criteria is
           displayed because there’s no search criterion for a new user. This behavior is
           different, because cancel on other screens preserves the prior input user search
           criteria.
           2.18.4.2.5. Message output field displays pertinent messages.
 46                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 2.5. Form Usage.




      2.18.4.3. The next step in creating a user is to fill in required fields. Required fields are
      those fields with a dark blue outline. The only optional field is the Middle Initial.
         2.18.4.3.1. Ensure the UserAccountName field (User-Id) is properly formatted.
         2.18.4.3.2. Password and ConfirmPassword fields must be filled in with a string that
         will pass DISA password check rules. These are matched fields so be careful to enter
         the same information, or you will receive a reject on the next screen.
         2.18.4.3.3. The next step in creating a user is to click on the CreateUser action
         button. This takes you to the Confirm Create User screen (Screen 3).

Figure 2.6. Screen 3 – Confirm Create User Form Layout.




             2.18.4.3.3.1. The layout of the Create User Screen is brief, since most data was
             entered previously.
             2.18.4.3.3.2. There are 7 items on the Create User Screen.
             2.18.4.3.3.3. Items 1-4 just display data from the previous screen about the user
             account to be created.
                 2.18.4.3.3.3.1. User Account Name
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                            47


                 2.18.4.3.3.3.2. Last Name
                 2.18.4.3.3.3.3. First Name
                 2.18.4.3.3.3.4. Middle Initial
             2.18.4.3.3.4. The ConfirmCreate action button confirms the data is correct and
             attempts to create an actual user account.
             2.18.4.3.3.5. The Cancel action button allows you to cancel creation of a new
             user account and displays Screen 2. When Screen 2 is displayed from a Cancel on
             this screen, no prior input information is retained because it is assumed you wish
             to create another user. If you need to modify erroneous data input about the
             current user, then you should hit the browser back button at this time. This
             reloads Screen 2 with the previously entered information for modification.
             2.18.4.3.3.6. The Message output field - displays error or completion messages.
             Messages displayed may be the result of initial checks, like passwords not
             matching, or the results from the actual user creation attempt after you click on
             the ConfirmCreate action button. The text in this field will vary, indicating that
             the user was created successfully, or that the user was unable to be created and
             why.

Figure 2.7. Form Usage.




      2.18.4.4. The next step in creating a user account is to confirm creation by clicking on
      Confirm Create. This will refresh the screen and display the result in the Message field.
         2.18.4.4.1. The Message field will attempt to provide the user a reason for failure if
         user account creation fails. Screen 3 will no longer display the ConfirmCreate button.
         This is done to prevent repeated failed attempts to create a user without correcting the
         invalid information. At this point, a user must click either the Cancel button on this
         screen or the Back button for their browser to correct the data that caused the user
         account creation to fail.
         2.18.4.4.2. When user creation is successful, then the Message field will display a
         message stating so. The Add/Remove User Access Privileges screen, (Screen 4) will
         be displayed after a short period to allow assignment of access privileges to complete
         the user account creation.

Figure 2.8. Screen 4 – Add/Remove User Access Privileges Form Layout.




           2.18.4.4.3. Add/Remove User Access Privileges Screen contains 18 items and is
           divided into three sections. The left side of each section lists the privileges assigned
           to the person who is creating the user account. The right side is the privileges
           assigned to the new user. The heading contains a few fields (User Account Name,
           Lastname etc.) about the new user.
               2.18.4.4.3.1. The Data Visibility section of the screen refers to SRAN(s)/Air
               Force Base(s) a user is allowed access to in the database.
                   2.18.4.4.3.1.1. Fields are divided into 2 groups:
                     2.18.4.4.3.1.1.1. Administrator Group:    Admin SRAN List drop down
                     menu               lists            (Left             Side)            .
                     SRANs the administrator has access to and can assign to a user. AddSRAN

                     2.18.4.4.3.1.1.2. User Group: User SRAN List drop down menu(Right
                     Side)                             lists                               those
                     SRANs the user has been previously assigned. RemoveSRAN action button
                     - removes the selected SRAN from the list the user is allowed access.
               2.18.4.4.3.2. Database Privileges (DB) section of the screen refers to those
               internal privileges and setups a user needs to access the database objects correctly.
Fields are divided into 2 groups:
                   2.18.4.4.3.2.1. Administrator Group: Admin DB Privilege List drop down
                   menu (Left Side) lists DB Privileges that the Administrator has assigned and

             can assign to a user. AddDBPrivilege action button - adds the selected DB
             Privilege to the user.
             2.18.4.4.3.2.2. User Group: ser DB Privilege List drop down menu (Right
             Side) lists the DB Privileges that the user has assigned. RemoveDBPrivilege
             action button - removes a selected DB Privilege from the user.
          2.18.4.4.3.3. The Program Visibility section of the screen refers to those
          programs the user has access to in the normal login menu list.
             2.18.4.4.3.3.1. Fields are divided into 2 groups:
                 2.18.4.4.3.3.1.1. Administrator Group: Admin App List drop down menu
                 (Left Side) lists applications that the Administrator has assigned and can

             screen. The Add and Remove buttons actually apply the changes to the
             database as soon as they are selected.
             2.18.4.4.3.3.3. Cancel action button returns to the Managing an Existing User
             version of Screen 2 (to be discussed in a future section). This is done because
             a user account has been created and has only the default assigned
             (DiscViewer) because the Cancel button was clicked. If the Cancel button on
             Screen 2 is selected, Screen 1 is displayed without any prior search criteria.
             2.18.4.4.3.3.4. The Message output field is for displaying pertinent messages

           2.18.4.4.4. The last step in creating a user is to assign access privileges. There are
           three categories//types of access privileges:
              2.18.4.4.4.1. Data Visibility
              2.18.4.4.4.2. Database Privileges
              2.18.4.4.4.3. Program Visibility/Menu Groups
              2.18.4.4.4.4. Special instructions.
For Administrative users the following features apply:
                  2.18.4.4.4.4.1. Level 1 User Administrator (UserAdmLvl1 Database
                  Privilege) accounts can create, modify, or delete level 1, 2, or 3 user accounts.
                  In addition, User Administrators are automatically granted access to all
                  SRANs.
                  2.18.4.4.4.4.2. Level 2 User Administrator (UserAdmLvl2 Database
                  Privilege) accounts can create, modify, or delete level 3 user accounts only.
                  In addition, User Administrators are automatically granted access to all
                  SRANs.
                  2.18.4.4.4.4.3. Level 3 User will have no administrator privileges assigned.
              2.18.4.4.4.5. To setup Data Visibility select the proper SRAN(s) from the, Admin
              SRAN List, and click the, AddSRAN, button to add to the users SRAN list. A
              user may be granted access to one, some, or all SRANs. The preferred method for
              adding SRANs to a users account is groups (MAJCOMs). It is advantageous for
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                        51


             performance purposes to add an entire MAJCOM or ALL AF MAJCOMs and
             remove (an) individual SRAN(s), if necessary. For example: A user requires
             access to all AMC accounts, except Travis and Dover. The best method for
             granting Data Visibility would be 1L MAJCOM (All AMC), click “Add SRAN”.
             The next step would be to select 4427 Travis CA and 4497 Dover DE from the
             “User SRAN List”. Click the “RemoveSRAN” button. This user now has access
             to all AMC accounts, except 4427 and 4497. This is the preferred method for
             creating the user in the above scenario for optimum Discoverer performance.

                to remove privileges.
                2.18.4.4.4.6.4. DiscViewer choice is the minimum access level a user can
                have and therefore, cannot be removed. If a user no longer requires access
                simply delete the account.
                2.18.4.4.4.6.5. Special Instructions.
                  2.18.4.4.4.6.5.1. If you select UserAdmLvl1 from the left side and add, you
                  will also be adding UserAdmLvl2 -because level 1 includes all level 2
                  functions.
                  2.18.4.4.4.6.5.2. When the drop down list on the right side contains
                  UserAdmLvl1 & 2 they must be removed in the following order:
                  UserAdmLvl1 then UserAdmLvl2
                  2.18.4.4.4.6.5.3. StdRptExec is required for Quick Run and Batch        Run
                  Apps to work properly when program visibility is assigned to a users    App
                  list.   Selecting StdRptExec from the left side and clicking             the
                  AddDBPrivilege button will create the following items on the right      side
                  drop down list:
                  2.18.4.4.4.6.5.4. DiscPlus and StdRptExec. When the drop down list on the
                  right side contains StdRptExec and DiscPlus they must be removed in the
                  following order: StdRptExec then DiscPlus
                  2.18.4.4.4.6.5.5. DiscPlus is required for the Create Queries App to work
                  properly when program visibility is assigned to a users App list.
             2.18.4.4.4.7. To setup Program Visibility, you select the proper App from the
             Admin App List on the left and click the AddApp button. This controls the menu
             items a user sees on left side of the main menu screen after they have logged in.

                   Applications
                  2.18.4.4.4.7.3. Adding all but one of the Menu Groups can be accomplished
                  by adding the All Menu Groups from the left side and then removing the
                  single item you don’t want the user to have access to on the right side.
                  2.18.4.4.4.7.4. Special Instructions.
Extreme caution must be taken when assigning Apps from the Migration Menu Group to a user.
Users with Upload or Restart Upload program visibility will be able to start migrations. No
special database privilege is required to start or restart migrations.
If assigning Delete Reports App from the Reports Menu Group you must ensure it is assigned in
conjunction with View Outputs App. This is because it’s only accessible through the View
Outputs App.
When removing database privileges you should also remove the applicable applications as well.
                  2.18.4.4.4.7.5. The Done action button returns you to the Search/Select User
                  screen when you’re finished assigning privileges to the user. Add and
                  Remove buttons actually applied the changes to the database as soon as they
                  were selected.

     2.19.1.5.9. Display User Tablespace Info, includes the 2 fields in the second section.
     Displays two important internal database tabelspaces (Default Tablespace and
     Temporary Tablespace) assigned to the user. These values are important to
     Administrative personnel because they may be the reason a user’s account doesn’t
     work properly. No update capability is provided for this information since they
     seldom change for a user. It may be necessary to delete and reload a user account if
     they’re in error.
     2.19.1.5.10. Display User Account Status and Lock/Unlock User Account, includes
     the fields on the left side of the third section of the form. As the name suggests, it
     displays the current status of a user account. Account Status fields are color coded as
     follows:
        2.19.1.5.10.1. Green: Account is Open and available for use
        2.19.1.5.10.2. Red: Account is Locked unavailable for use
     2.19.1.5.11. Accounts can be in locked status for a variety of reasons, such as an
     expired password, too many failed login attempts, or manually locked by an
     administrator. If an account is locked the LockDate field will show the date and time
     when locked status was assigned. Lock/Open action button is for locking or
     unlocking the user account. The result of such lock/open attempt will be reflected in
     the account status field, lock date and displayed in the Message field at the bottom of
     the form.
     2.19.1.5.12. Display User Password Expiration Date and Reset User Password
     includes 3 fields on the right of the third section. First is to display the current user
     account password expiration date assigned to the user. The date assigned is
     calculated by using the following:
        2.19.1.5.12.1. The date the user was created or the last date the user changed the
        password. Plus the expiration timeframe assigned by DISA to the standard user
        profile.
        2.19.1.5.12.2. The NewPassword and ConfirmPassword fields allow an
        administrator to reset a user’s password. Administrator has to enter the data into
        these fields. Inputs into these fields must match, thus eliminating the possibility
        of incorrect entry. If the mouse cursor is placed over either label, it will provide
        help on formatting a password that will be accepted by DISA. ResetPassword
        button is for initiating a call back to this screen which will attempt to do a
        password change based on the input fields. It will also set a flag in a table so that
        when the user logs in next, he/she will receive a message stating that they need to
        change their password (to prevent the administrator from knowing a user’s
        password too long). Result of such reset password attempt will be reflected in the
        Message field.
     2.19.1.5.13. The ChangeAccess action button displays the Add/Remove User Access
     Privileges Screen, (Screen 3).
     2.19.1.5.14. The KillSession action button displays the Kill User Sessions Screen,
     (Screen 4).

         2.19.1.5.15. The DeleteUser action button displays the Confirm Delete Screen,
         (Screen 5).
         2.19.1.5.16. The Cancel action button returns to the search screen. Search screen
         displays the prior search criteria.
         2.19.1.5.17. The Message field at the bottom is for displaying pertinent messages, for
         example, results of updating user info, locking/opening accounts and resetting
         passwords.

      2.19.2.1. To make a change, update those fields (in this example CommPhone and
      DSNPhone were changed) and click the UpdateUserInfo action button. After this the
      screen will refresh, database update will be attempted, fields will be reread from the
      database, and a message displayed. If the change was successful then the screen will
      display the updated results. If it wasn’t, then the changed fields revert back to the
      original value. In the above example, the change attempt was successful.
      2.19.2.2. The Display User Tablespace Information is for display only. They show if the
      user is assigned to MAJCOM specific tablespaces, or if the user is assigned to the overall
      default tablespaces. In the below example, the user is assigned to MAJCOM 1L
      tablespaces.

      2.19.2.4. Display User Password Info and Reset User Password Account combines both
      display only info and a simple update capability. The ExpirationDate field on this form
      should never display “NONE” because this means expiration date feature of passwords is
      not being enforced. Update of a user’s password may be needed for a variety of reasons,
      such as forgotten passwords, expired passwords, etc. To update a user’s password, fill
      the required fields (NewPasssword and ConfirmPassword) and click the ResetPassword
      action button. If the password change was successful a message is displayed and the
      ExpirationDate field will be updated. If unsuccessful, the ExpirationDate is not updated
      and an error message is displayed.

                               MIGRATION PROCEDURES

Section 3A—- Overview And Summary.

3.1. Chapter Summary. Chapter 3 describes the three key components supply users need to
migrate legacy Standard Base Supply System data to the AFSCDB and Air Force Data Services
(AFDS): NGV301V, NGV301M and the Supply Web Migration Browser. These programs
have unique functions:
   3.1.1. NGV301V identifies erroneous legacy supply data.
   3.1.2. NGV301M builds UNISYS flat files for each legacy record type and then transfers the
   files to the AFSCDB. Once a successful migration occurs within AFSCDB, 57 of the 107
   files are then sent to AFDS. If AFDS does not receive data for a specific date, see Para. 3.5
   for recovery instructions.
   3.1.3. The Supply Web Migration Browser provides a web-based graphical user interface
   that allows materiel management personnel to access the AFSCDB to monitor data
   migrations.

Section 3B—- Data Migration Validation Program (NGV301V).

3.2. . This section provides processing procedures for the NGV301V Supply Data Migration
Program.
   3.2.1. Purpose. NGV301V validates Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) legacy data prior
   to migrating legacy data to the AFSCDB.
   3.2.2. Program Logic. NGV301V compares selected SBSS legacy records to AFMC SCM-
   R Information Technology Activity-developed data validation rules. Supply records that for
   some reason do not meet NGV301V validation rules will not migrate to the AFSCDB. Para.
   3.8, NGV301V Validation Rules contain a list of legacy records validated by NGV301V and
   the validation rules for each legacy record.
   3.2.3. Special Instructions. NGV301V can be processed against either the primary or
   secondary system but corrections to erroneous records should be applied to the primary
   system. NGV301V is not a mandatory report but can be processed as often as needed (as-
   required). NGV301V is processed as follows:

Table 3.1. NGV301V Processing.
@START 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301V,,,,<gang>GV0
Note: <gang> is the appropriate gang number
   3.2.4. Database Errors. NGV301V produces a report that should be reviewed by Computer
   Operations personnel. Errors are written to file #GV0<aln>*GV301VUD001 where # is the
   gang number and <aln> is the base Access Location Number. NGV301V errors should be
   corrected as soon as possible to ensure only accurate supply data is migrated to the AFSCDB.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                        71


   3.2.5. Additional NGV301V Documentation. Para. 3.9, NGV301V Error Messages
   provides a list of error messages produced by NGV301V. Para. 3.10, AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity Corrective Actions for NGV301V Errors provides
   procedures for correcting NGV301V errors.

Section 3C—- Supply Records Download And Transfer (NGV301M).

3.3. . This section provides processing procedures for NGV301M Supply Records Download
and Transfer Program.
   3.3.1. Purpose. NGV301M transfers SBSS legacy records to the UNIX server at Defense
   Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) Oklahoma City that hosts the AFSCDB. Para. 3.11,
   NGV301M Downloaded Record Codes provides a list of records downloaded and transferred
   by NGV301M to the AFSCDB UNIX server.
   3.3.2. Program Logic. NGV301M builds UNISYS flat files containing supply legacy data
   for selected SBSS legacy records. NGV301M then transfers the flat files using File Transfer
   Protocol (FTP) to the AFSCDB server at DECC Oklahoma City. NGV301M uses the same
   data validation rules used by NGV301V to ensure only accurate legacy supply data is
   migrated to the AFSCDB.
   3.3.3. Special Instructions. With the exception of transaction history records, NGV301M-
   DR downloads selected supply records from the secondary database. Processing NGV301M-
   DR against the primary database (e.g., 1GV0) will download all 704 Consolidated
   Transaction History (CTH) records plus selected supply records from the secondary database.
   Processing NGV301M-DR against the secondary database (e.g., 5GV0) will download the
   current day’s 704 records only plus selected supply records from the secondary database.
   NGV301M-DR must be processed daily after crossover has completed and the D37 has come
   to a good end of job. NGV301M-DR is processed as follows:

Table 3.2. Gang number.
@START 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301M-DR,,,,<gang>GV0
Note: <gang> is the appropriate gang number
   3.3.4. NGV301M Setup. Prior to processing NGV301M-DR, a new element in file
   0GV00000*NGV301M must be created for each ALN. To create the element, open
   0GV00000*NGV301M.SGS-TXFR and make changes to the following entries:

Table 3.3. NGV301M Setup.
HOST ‘’###-###-###-###’’                   Note 1, 5, 6, 7
PATH /h/gv/<release>/migr/                 Note 2, 5, 6, 7
USER xxxxxx                                Note 3, 5, 6, 7
PASS xxxxxx                                Note 4, 5, 6, 7
 72                                                   AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


Notes:
1. HOST ’’###-###-###-###’’ is the IP address of the UNIX server
where the UNISYS flat files created by NGV301M-DR will be sent via
FTP.
2. PATH is the directory where files created by NGV301M-DR
processing will be transferred on the UNIX server for upload into the
AFSCDB.
3. USER is the login id for the FTP transfer on the UNIX server.
4. PASS is the password for the login id of the FTP transfer on the
UNIX server.
5. HOST, PATH, USER, and PASS are constants.
6. PATH, USER, and PASS are case sensitive. FTP transfers will fail
if case does not match the settings on the UNIX server.
7. Settings for HOST, PATH, USER, and PASS should be requested
from the UNIX server administrator at DECC Oklahoma City.
       3.3.4.1. Save the changes as 0GV00000*NGV301M.SGS-TXFR/<aln><Primarygang>.
       For example, “0GV00000*NGV301M.SGS-TXR/9800G1”. Bases must create this
       element for their ALN prior to starting NGV301M-DR.
       3.3.4.2. An update to each 0GV00000*NGV301M.SGS-TXFR/<aln><Primary gang>
       previously created will be required with any change to HOST, PATH, and/or PASS on
       the UNIX server. If this change is not reflected in EACH 0GV00000*NGV301M.SGS-
       TXFR/<aln><Primary gang> file, bases will experience FTP failures during NGV301M-
       DR processing.
   3.3.5. Database Errors. NGV301M-DR produces a Download and Transfer Log File that
   provides record counts for downloaded records. The file also shows the file transfer of each
   record. Computer Operations personnel should review the log file to ensure legacy records
   are downloaded and successfully transferred to the AFSCDB.               The log file is
   #GV0<aln>*GV301MUD802 where # is the gang number and <aln> is the base Access
   Location Number.
   3.3.6. Special Options. There are several special options of NGV301M. These options are
   described below:
       3.3.6.1. NGV301M-MD (Partial Flat File Download and Transfer). NGV301M-MD’s
       primary purpose is to manually download and transfer to the AFSCDB a previous day’s
       704-CT-HISTORY data. NGV301M-MD provides the capability to download and
       transfer one or more UNISYS flat files that did not download as a result of database
       problems during NGV301M-DR processing. Before using NGV301M-MD to download
       and transfer 704-CT-HISTORY from any previous day’s business, bases should follow
       the process below:
          3.3.6.1.1. Execute NGV301M-DR.
          3.3.6.1.2. Allow the normal daily data migration upload to finish completely.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                        73


          3.3.6.1.3. Change the 002-ORDINAL-DATE on the secondary (gang 5) to the date
          that will be recovered.
          3.3.6.1.4. NGV301M-MD will read this date and download ONLY those 704 records
          that meet that 002-ORDINAL-DATE.
          3.3.6.1.5. Contact ILS-S field assistance branch if you have questions about this
          recovery process or NGV301M. To process NGV301M-MD, complete the following
          actions:

Table 3.4. NGV301M-MD Processing.
>@QUAL <Secondary gang>GV0<aln>
Example: @QUAL 5GV09012
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301M-MD
After receiving back a SOE sign enter the record numbers to be
downloaded and transferred. For example, the command below
will download and transfer record types 001, 002 and 003.
>RCD 001,002,003 <xmit>
>@ <xmit>
Note: The @ command will start the manual download and
transfer process. The run-id should be:
<Secondary gang>GV<first record number entered>
       3.3.6.2. NGV301M-TO (Manual Flat File Transfer without Download). NGV301M-TO
       provides the capability to manually transfer one or more UNISYS flat files that did not
       transfer to the UNIX database server (e.g., server problems, FTP failures, etc.) during
       NGV301M-DR or NGV301M-MD processing. Do not process NGV301M-TO unless
       UNISYS flat file transfer errors were encountered during a NGV301M-DR or
       NGV301M-MD processing. To process NGV301M-TO, complete the following actions:

Table 3.5. NGV301M-TO Processing.
@QUAL <Primary/Secondary gang>GV0<aln>
Example: @QUAL 5GV09012
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301M-TO
After receiving back a SOE sign enter the record number, applicable
group (1-4), or all records to be transferred. The following example
will transfer
001 record:
>REC 001 <xmit>
>@ <xmit>
Note: The @ command will start the manual transfer process.
The following example will transfer 001, 002, 003 records: >@QUAL
<Primary/Secondary gang>GV0<aln> <xmit>
 74                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4   8 AUGUST 2013


>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301M-TO <xmit>
>REC 001 <xmit>
>REC 002 <xmit>
>REC 003 <xmit>
>@ <xmit>
The following example will transfer initial group 1 related records:
>@QUAL <Primary/Secondary gang>GV0<aln> <xmit>
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301M-TO <xmit>
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.SGS-GRP1-I <xmit>
>@ <xmit>
Note: The @ command will start the manual transfer process.
The following example will transfer daily group 2 related records:
>@QUAL <Primary/Secondary gang>GV0<aln> <xmit>
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301M-TO <xmit>
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.SGS-GRP2-D <xmit>
>@ <xmit>
Note: The @ command will start the manual transfer process.
The following example will transfer all records:
>@QUAL <Primary/Secondary gang>GV0<aln> <xmit>
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301M-TO <xmit>
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.SGS-GRP-ALL <xmit>
>@ <xmit>
Note: The @ command will start the manual transfer process.
       3.3.6.3. NGV301M-LT (Manual 701 Count File Transfer). NGV301M-LT provides
       capability to manually transfer the #GV0<aln>*GV301MUD701 count file to the UNIX
       database server in the event the transfer of this file failed during NGV301M-DR,
       NGV301M-MD or NGV301M-TO processing. Do not process NGV301M-LT unless the
       GV301MUD701 count file did not transfer to the UNIX database server successfully
       during an NGV301M-DR, NGV301M-MD, or NGV301M-TO processing. To process
       NGV301M-LT, complete the following actions:

Table 3.6. NGV301M-LT Processing.
>@QUAL </Primary/Secondary Gang>GV0
Example: @QUAL 5GV09012
>@ADD 0GV00000*NGV301M.NGV301M-LT
3.4. Upload to AFSCDB (Phase II of Daily Legacy Data Migration). The upload of data into
the AFSCDB consists of several processes.
   3.4.1. First, before new data is uploaded into the AFSCDB, existing data is deleted
   (truncated). All normal supply records are deleted/truncated with the exception of 704
   records. 704 records are truncated only if NGV301M-DR was processed on the primary.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                         75


   Recall all 704 records are downloaded and transferred to the AFSCDB server when
   processing NGV301M-DR against the primary. Only current day 704 records are
   downloaded and transferred when processing NGV301M-DR against the secondary.
   Therefore, if NGV301M-DR is processed against the secondary, then the 704 records are not
   truncated in the AFSCDB – instead, the new records are “appended” to the existing 704 data.
   3.4.2. Second, a program (UNIX CRON) residing on the AFSCDB UNIX server
   automatically uploads new files from ALN/gangs as a result of NGV301M-DR processing
   into the AFSCDB. Currently, the CRON at DECC Oklahoma City is setup to “look” for files
   from 0100 to 2330 hours in 45 minute increments. In other words, beginning at 0100 hours,
   the CRON will scan the UNIX server for new files for every ALN/gang. The scan is
   performed every 45 minutes. Once new files are found, the files are then “uploaded”
   (migrated) into the AFSCDB.            Bases should contact the AFSCDB UNIX server
   Administrator to change the scheduled CRON processing times (i.e. from 45 minutes to 30
   minutes, etc.) if a change is necessary.
   3.4.3. The Supply Web Migration Browser can be used to monitor the progress of legacy
   data migrations to the AFSCDB. The web browser provides the capability to “connect” to
   the AFSCDB to check download and transfer logs, check migration status, analyze migration
   reports, extract data error information from error logs, manually restart an upload, or
   manually upload a 704-CT-HISTORY flat file.
3.5. Air Force Data Services Missing Transactions – Recovery Instructions
   3.5.1. There are necessary steps that should be taken if a date is reported as missing within
   AFDS. It is imperative that these steps are completed to ensure data integrity exists in both
   AFSCDB and AFDS. The steps to recover a specific date that is missing with AFDS is as
   follows:
       3.5.1.1. If date that is missing reflects current secondary date, just reprocess NGV301M-
       DR.
       3.5.1.2. If the base did crossover, then a recovery of the secondary is necessary.
Note: Recovery is necessary because AFDS receives 101, 202, 203, 205, 901, etc. data from
AFSCDB. If you just process a 704 recovery, then AFDS receives the same 101, 202, 203, etc.
data as they did in the previous NGV301M run.
       3.5.1.3. Before executing any recovery, process RPTEON on secondary database.
       3.5.1.4. Determine secondary tape number for the missing date.
       3.5.1.5. Process Reload or ACOPY to recover the secondary dump using tape number
       from Para. 3.5.1.4.
       3.5.1.6. Once recovery completes, process NGV301M-DR
       3.5.1.7. After all NGV301M jobs have finished, log into AFSCDB Reports/Migration
       Web Page and ensure migration is started/completed. Once a successful migration is
       completed, files are then forwarded to AFDS.
       3.5.1.8. Repeat these steps for each day that needs to be recovered then crossover as
       normal, which will delete any secondary database that you recovered.

3.7. Web Migration Menu Options. The Supply Web Migration has eight main menu
suboptions as displayed in Figure 3.2

Figure 3.2. Web Migration Options.




   3.7.1. Download Stat displays the Download Status Report File. The status report file is
   generated whenever a download is initiated by processing NGV301M. An example of the
   Download Stat screen is displayed in Figure 3.3.

Figure 3.3. Download Status Report.




      3.7.1.1. The Download Stat Screen displays information such as Time of Last Migration
      for ALN/Gang, Time of Next Migration for ALN/Gang and the current status of
      ALN/Gang.
      3.7.1.2. The download status report file is a text file and can be lengthy. Bases can either
      view the report or download the report by choosing the appropriate ALN/Gang and then
      the appropriate report option. Figure 3.4. displays an example of View Report.

Figure 3.4. Download Stat - View All of Report




   3.7.2. The second option, Upload Stat, displays the Upload Status Report File. The status
   report file is generated whenever an Oracle migration upload is initiated to upload supply
   data to the AFSCDB. Figure 3.5. displays an example of the Upload Status Report.

Figure 3.5. Upload Status Report




      3.7.2.1. The Upload Status Report provides information about individual ALN/Gang
      migrations. For example, the time of Last Migration for ALN/Gang, time of Next
      migration for ALN/Gang and status of ALN/Gang.
      3.7.2.2. The upload status report file is also a text file and can be lengthy. Bases can
      either view a summary (the last part of the report) or all of the report. Figure 3.6.
      displays an example of All of Report.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                           79

Figure 3.7. displays an example of the screen when Last Part of the Report is chosen.

Figure 3.7. Upload Stat – Last Part of the Report.




       3.7.2.4. This report may be viewed even while an Oracle migration upload is processing.
       The report is a good progress indicator of the migration itself. Color-coded steps indicate
       how far the migration has progressed. To obtain the most recent status, bring the report
       up as normal and click the Refresh button.
   3.7.3. The third option Upload 704 Stat displays the 704/Consolidated Transaction History
   Upload Status Report File. The status report file is generated whenever migration of just the
   704 history transactions is initiated to the AFSCDB. Figure 3.8 displays an example of the
   704 Upload Status Report.
 80                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 3.8. Upload 704 Status Report.




      3.7.3.1. This report also allows users to view All of Report or just a summary. Figure
      3.9 provides an example of All of Report.

Figure 3.9. Upload 704 Status Report – All of Report.




      3.7.3.2. Note in Figure 3.9 the upload truncates (deletes) all data in the 704 table before
      uploading new 704 data. Figure 3.10 provides an example of the Last Part of Report.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                           81


Figure 3.10. Upload Status Report – Last Part of Report.




      3.7.3.3. This report may be viewed while an 704/consolidated history migration upload
      is processing. Color-coded steps again indicate how far the 704/consolidated history
      migration has progressed. To refresh, bring the report up as normal and click the Refresh
      button.
   3.7.4. The fourth option, Detailed Errors, displays the migration Error/OK Files. The
   detailed error/ok log files are generated whenever an Oracle migration is initiated. These
   detailed error/ok log files are for each table in the AFSCDB. Figure 3.11 provides an
   example of the Detailed Error/OK files screen.

Figure 3.11. Detailed Error/OK Files.




      3.7.4.1. A detailed error "Error" log file is generated when a table is loaded with errors.
      A detailed error "OK" log file is generated when a table is loaded without errors.
      Additional information is displayed such as the Time of Last Migration for ALN/Gang,
      Time of Next migration for ALN/Gang and Status of ALN/Gang. Selecting a particular
      ALN/Gang will display a list of Error/OK files. Figure 3.12 provides an example.
 82                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 3.12. Detailed Error/OK Files.




      3.7.4.2. To display a specific Error/OK file, select a file from the list box. The
      appropriate Error/OK log file is displayed in the Content Frame. Figure 3.13 provides an
      example.

Figure 3.13. Example Error/OK File.




      3.7.4.3. Three types of error files are available: AllFiles, AllErrorFiles or AllOKFiles.
   3.7.5. The fifth option, Restart Upload, will start the upload migration for a particular ALN
   and Gang. Restarting an upload initiates the upload for ALL record types downloaded as
   part of NGV301M-DR processing regardless of whether or not data in the flat files residing
   on the UNIX server have changed since the last upload. Figure 3.14 provides an example of
   the Restart Upload screen.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                          83


Figure 3.14. Restart Upload.




      3.7.5.1. The screen displays information such as the Time of Last Migration for
      ALN/Gang, the Time of Next Migration for ALN/Gang and the Status of ALN/Gang.
      3.7.5.2. The restart of an upload includes any full or daily 704-CT-HISTORY data last
      transferred to the UNIX database server. This option should only be executed if a
      previous migration upload has abnormally ended or the data in the secondary database for
      the ALN/Gang has changed with the intent to reflect those changes in the AFSCDB.
      3.7.5.3. Once ALN/Gang is chosen, a migration restart will commence and a short
      confirmation message will be displayed in the Content Frame stating that progress of the
      migration can be seen via selecting the Upload Stat menu option or the View All Status
      menu option. Figure 3.15 provides an example.

Figure 3.15. Restart Upload – Confirmation Message.




   3.7.6. The sixth option, Restart 704 Upload, starts the upload migration for the
   704/Consolidated Transaction History for a particular ALN and Gang. Restarting a 704
   upload initiates the upload of data for only the 704-CT-HISTORY record type downloaded
   by NGV301M-DR or NGV301M-MD processing. Restart 704 Upload processing will not
   upload data for any other record type.
      3.7.6.1. This option is primarily intended for an independent, manually controlled upload
      of a day of missed “daily” history data. It can be used, however, to completely replace
 84                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4           8 AUGUST 2013


      accumulated history data in the modern Reports database with a current, “full” history
      downloaded from the legacy database represented by the ALN/Gang.
      3.7.6.2. The 704 Upload program automatically differentiates receipt of a “daily” history
      flat file vs. a “full” history flat file and will execute regardless of whether or not data in
      the 704 flat file residing on the UNIX database server at that time has changed since.
      3.7.6.3. This option should be executed only if one or more days of 704-CT-HISTORY
      could not be uploaded into the modern Reports database due to data migration problems
      AND there is no need to upload data from any other record type. Figure 3.16 provides
      an example of the Restart 704 Upload screen.

Figure 3.16. Restart 704 Upload.




      3.7.6.4. This screen displays information such as the Time of Last Migration for
      ALN/Gang, the Time of Next migration for ALN/Gang and the Status of ALN/Gang.
      3.7.6.5. Once ALN/Gang is chosen, 704/Consolidated Transaction History migration
      restart will commence and a short confirmation message will be displayed in the Content
      Frame stating that progress of the migration can be seen via selecting the Upload 704 Stat
      menu option (discussed earlier). Figure 3.17 provides an example.

Figure 3.17. Restart 704 Upload – Confirmation Message.




   3.7.7. The seventh option, View All Stats, displays the View All Active Migration Stats
   screen. Figure 3.18 provides an example.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                          85


Figure 3.18. View All Active Migration Stats.




      3.7.7.1. This screen provides status information for more than one ALN/Gang. The
      screen will also display a combined status report in the Content Frame of all the active
      migration uploads currently in progress. Refresh the screen to obtain the latest combined
      active migration status.
   3.7.8. The eighth and final option, Overall View, displays the Overall View of Migrations
   screen. Figure 3.19 provides an example.

Figure 3.19. Overall View of Migrations.




      3.7.8.1. This screen provides graphical status information for more than one ALN/Gang.
      This screen is used to display a combined, graphical overall report in the full browser
      window of all the non-active and active Oracle migration uploads currently in progress.
      For each marked AF installation, the name of the AF Installation can be viewed by
      simply moving the mouse over the mark. Selecting the mark will display the Migration
      Upload Stat Report - Last Part of Report screen. Figure 3.20 provides another example.

             DISCOVERER USERS MANUAL AND PROGRAM RESUMES

Section 4A—- Chapter Summary And Discoverer Plus Basic Concepts.

4.1. Chapter Summary. This chapter explains basic concepts and provides some step-by-step
instructions for using Oracle Discoverer Plus. This chapter also provides basic information
regarding reports built using Oracle Discoverer Plus.
Note: Permission has been obtained from Oracle Corporation to use copyrighted material.
4.2. Overview.
   4.2.1. Section Summary. This chapter provides users with information to successfully
   generate and/or process ad hoc queries.
   4.2.2. Scope. This chapter provides detailed information on all aspects of the Discoverer ad
   hoc query tool.
   4.2.3. Audience. Primary audience for this chapter is all RPS operators and any SBSS user
   requiring data from the reports database.
   4.2.4. Prerequisites. Users of Discoverer should have a basic understanding of table
   relationships within the SBSS.
4.3. How Discover Works.
   4.3.1. How Discoverer Works. Discoverer provides the supply technician/analyst with a
   user-friendly ad hoc data retrieval tool. It gives the user capability of retrieving, organizing,
   and displaying data; when they want it, in the way they want it. In addition to giving the user
   an option of creating their own query from scratch, a number of standard ad hoc queries have
   been provided. Although standard ad hoc queries contain a predefined set of data, they allow
   the flexibility of applying conditions, changing sort sequence, and modifying the display.
   This tool will also prove invaluable to the supply manager as it helps them make sound
   decisions with the embedded analytical functions.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                            131


Figure 4.1. Oracle Discoverer.




Discoverer solves many of the problems normally associated with databases. Now you can
easily:
       4.3.1.1. Find data you know is in the database.
       4.3.1.2. See data displayed quickly without waiting for the computer to spend time
       searching through the entire database.
       4.3.1.3. View data in a familiar format that is easy to read and understand.
       4.3.1.4. Analyze data using a wide array of techniques; including drilling up and down
       through the data's details, finding data that meets certain conditions or falls within ranges
       you specify, sorting data, comparing results from "what if" scenarios, and so on.
       4.3.1.5. Prepare reports of your analytical results and findings.
       4.3.1.6. Share data with others, and in other applications (such as Excel, Hyper-Text
       Markup Language (HTML), etc.)
   4.3.2. Discoverer uses a new, unique way of accessing data. Comparing Discoverer with
   previous data access methods can help you understand new concepts used with Discoverer
   Plus.
       4.3.2.1. What is an End User Layer (EUL)? A layer of information used by Oracle
       Discoverer to hide the complexities and details of underlying database. The EUL
       provides a user-friendly view into the data, making it easier and faster to create queries
 132                                                       AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


       because it organizes the data to reflect particular business areas. The same data can also
       be used for more than one situation.
       4.3.2.2. What is a Business Area? A business area is a logical grouping of database
       tables or views that apply to your specific data requirements. For example, Stock Control
       wants data about due-outs and due-ins, while Storage & Issue is interested in warehouse
       information. Although some of the required data may be the same, the exact combination
       of tables and views for each element or section is usually unique. Using the
       Administration Edition, the Discoverer Administrator tailors the grouping of data to
       provide you with the proper access to the precise data needed for analysis, decision
       support, and presentation of results. Business areas are further divided into folders.
       4.3.2.3. The EUL for the supply reports database has been organized into eight different
       business areas:
           4.3.2.3.1. Inventory: Contains all inventory related tables; such as inventory
           adjustment information, details frozen for inventory, inventory control, etc.
           4.3.2.3.2. Item Detail: Contains all detail tables; such as adjusted level detail, supply
           point detail, part number detail, etc.
           4.3.2.3.3. Management: Contains all management tables used for analysis; such as
           excess stratification, requisition summary, weapon support effectiveness, etc.
           4.3.2.3.4. Organization: Contains all organizational information; such as delivery
           destination, organization cost center, reporting organizational file identity, etc.
           4.3.2.3.5. SRD/RID/I&SG: Contains all SRD, routing identifier, and interchangeable
           and substitute group data; such as interchangeable & substitute group stock number
           relationship, order & ship time by routing identifier, standard reporting designator
           (SRD) consumption, etc.
           4.3.2.3.6. Support: Contains all support type tables; such as system designator,
           exception phrases, cumulative reject suspense, etc.
           4.3.2.3.7. System: Contains system type tables; such as base constants, special
           control, supply table counts, etc.
           4.3.2.3.8. Transaction history: Contains all daily and consolidated transaction history
           information; such as daily transaction history, transaction summary, consolidated
           transaction history, etc.
       4.3.2.4. What is a Folder? A folder is a collection of related items (data elements) within
       a business area. Folders are very similar to records in today’s SBSS. They are created
       and defined in the EUL using the Administration Edition.
       4.3.2.5. Understanding Joins. Before a user can select data from different folders, a
       relationship must exist between those different data elements. These relationships are
       created in Discoverer with “Joins.” A “Join” serves several purposes: 1) Brings or links
       different tables (Folders) together; 2) Provides relationship between different tables; 3)
       Logical pairing of tables in a database on matching data in specific columns.
Note: Order of table selection when creating a “Join” determines the “Master Table” and
“Detail Table.” The first table selected is the Master; the second table selected is the detail. It is
AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013                                                           133


very important to select the proper table as the Master and Detail to achieve desired results. For
example, if you want to choose due-outs with due-ins, you would select the due-out table first to
make it the “Master” and the due-in table second to make it the “Detail” table. If this is selected
in the other order it would provide invalid records.
           4.3.2.5.1. Discoverer uses two types of “Joins”: 1) Inner (Natural) and 2) Outer.
               4.3.2.5.1.1. An Inner-Join is based on a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.
               It retrieves all rows from one table and any matching rows from another table.
               When values in two tables match, they are combined and displayed as one row.
               For example: Inner-Join between the requisition number on the due-out detail and
               the requisition number on the due-in detail will only return due-outs that have
               requisition numbers. For example: Inner-Join between the stock number on the
               item record and the stock number on the supply point detail will return only those
               stock numbers that have a supply point detail assigned.
               4.3.2.5.1.2. Outer-Join is based on a one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-none
               relationship. It retrieves all rows from one table and any matching rows from
               another table. When values in two tables match, they are combined and displayed
               as one row. It also displays all rows from one table even if the joined table does
               not have a matching value. For example: Outer-Join between the requisition
               number on the due-out detail and the requisition number on the due-in detail will
               return due-outs that have requisition numbers and due-outs without requisition
               numbers. For example: Outer-Join between the stock number on the item record
               and the stock number on the supply point detail will return all stock numbers,
               with or without a supply point detail assigned.
       4.3.2.6. Understanding Workbooks and Worksheets. Think of a workbook as a three-
       ring-binder filled with specific data for reports. The workbook has pages, or worksheets,
       that contain data for different options of the report. For example, if the workbook is for
       Exception Phrases, different worksheets are the types of exception codes: Excess, Issue,
       Requisition, and Shipment.
4.4. Starting Discoverer.

4.5. What You See on the Screen. The following information explains how to use the various
items on the screen while working with Discoverer Plus.
   4.5.1. Workbook Window. The workbook window is where you will do most of your work
   with Discoverer Plus. It shows the data in the workbook.

       4.5.1.1. Menu and tool bar. Discoverer provides a standard menu and tool bar. The
       Menu bar includes selections for common tasks such as printing, saving files, and getting
       “Help.” The Tool bar includes shortcuts for your most common tasks. Much of
       Discoverer’s power is accessible from the menu bar. Each menu selection provides a
       dialog or Wizard to help you perform a task. Clicking a button on either bar executes that
       button's function. Functions controlled by these buttons are also available from the
       menus.Also, notice that when you put the cursor on a button, it enlarges and displays a
       small tool tip that tells you what the button is for. Text on the status bar shows a slightly
       expanded version of the explanation.

(Totals in this example).
       4.5.1.2. Axis Items. Page axis, top axis, and left axis on the workbook window represent
       data that have a relatively few, discrete values associated with them.
           4.5.1.2.1. Typical axis items are System Designator, SRAN, activity code, type
           account code, exception code, ERRCD, etc. For example, usually type account code
           has only a few values associated with it: B (Supplies), E (Equipment), P (Fuels), and
           K (Munitions).
           4.5.1.2.2. Axis items represent data that you can pivot on a cross tab worksheet or
           that can be column headings on a table. Another way of thinking about axis items is
           that they are the items that would appear on the axes of a graph. When creating a
           new worksheet, identify the data that become axis items.
       4.5.1.3. Data Points. Data points of a table or cross tab are the data in the "body" of the
       worksheet. Data points are the data that you want to use for analysis purposes or to see
       listed on a table. On a cross tab worksheet, the data is usually numerical, such as number
       of inventory discrepancies or extended value of requisitions by budget code.
       4.5.1.4. Worksheet tabs. Click to open or view the various worksheets in the workbook.
       If you previously opened the worksheet in the current session, it appears right away. If
       you haven't opened the worksheet yet, Discoverer queries the database and then displays
       it. These tabs can be renamed.
       4.5.1.5. Page scroll buttons.    Click to scroll through the worksheet pages in the
       workbook.
       4.5.1.6. Page scroll bars. If the worksheet is larger than the screen, it extends off the
       edges of the screen. Click the scroll bars to see the rest of the worksheet.
   4.5.2. Four Types of Display. Data can be displayed four different ways on the workbook
   window.
       4.5.2.1. Table layout. The most familiar layout for data is a table, which lists data in
       rows and columns. Typical data for tables includes such layouts as a stock number list
       with all of its indicative data sorted by warehouse location or budget code, lists of DIFM
       details from various organizations, lists of due-outs with their corresponding due-in, and
       so on.
Here is a sample of a table layout on the workbook window. As you can see, it is essentially a
listing of data.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                            141


Figure 4.7. Figure 2-3 Discoverer Table Layout.




      4.5.2.2. Table Layout with page details. A table layout with page details is a table with
      multiple pages of data, where each page shows various portions of the data in detail. You
      set the criteria for displaying portions of data in order to see exactly what you want on
      each page. Usually this type of layout is used to study data details in a specific, recurring
      way. For example, in the example in the figure above, you may want to see the stock
      numbers by budget code. In this scenario, each page would show one budget code with
      all the corresponding stock numbers.
 142                                                      AFH23-123V2PT4           8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.8. Discoverer Table Layout With Page Items.




       4.5.2.3. Cross tab layout. A cross tab, short for "cross-tabulation," relates two different
       sets of data and summarizes their interrelationship in terms of a third set of data. For
       example, a typical cross tab might show the total number of a specific rejects by function
       number. In other words, there are three sets of original data: reject number, function
       number, and count of each type reject for each function number. The reject number and
       function number are axes of the cross tab as rows and columns. Each row and column
       intersection shows the data points, in this case the total of a particular reject for a function
       number.
Every cross tab has at least three dimensions of data: rows, columns, and data points. However,
in Discoverer, cross tabs can show the interrelationships between many dimensions of data on
the various axes. A cross tab layout has three axes: side axis, top axis, and page axis. Because
each axis can hold several data items, a cross tab can display many dimensions of data.
For example, the following figure is a sample cross tab that shows five dimensions of data:
system designator, count of a type of reject, TRIC, function number, and reject number. In this
example, the data points (that is, the intersections, or cells on the cross tab) are the count of a
particular type reject. The next page of data would show the same type of data, except for the
next system designator.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                           143


Figure 4.9. Cross Tab Layout With Page Items.




Note:   Key to Figure
   a.   Page axis. In this sample, it contains a single data item: SRAN.
   b.   Top axis. This top axis contains two data items: Reject # Count and TRIC.
   c.   Side axis. This side axis also contains two data items: Function Number and Reject
        Number.
        4.5.2.4. Page detail cross tab layout. A page detail cross tab layout is a cross tab with
        multiple pages of data, so you can group the data on separate pages. You set the criteria
        for displaying portions of data in order to see exactly what you want on each page.
        4.5.2.5. One of the most powerful features of cross tabs is that they can uncover
        subtleties in the data that are not readily apparent from a table of data or from the raw
        data itself.
Note: A word of caution: Used incorrectly, cross tabs can show relationships between two sets
of numbers when, in fact, there is no meaningful correlation between them at all. Therefore, you
must understand the correlation of the data before the cross tab relationships make sense.
   4.5.3. Seeing Next Page of Data. When the page axis contains data, the table or cross tab
   displays one page of data at a time. A page displays all of the data for a particular data item,
   such as the rejects for SRAN 5000. To see another page of data on a table or cross tab:
        4.5.3.1. Click the down arrow next to the data you want to see. See Figure 4.10.
 144                                                   AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.10. Drop-Down List on Page Axis Items.




Note: Key to Figure
Click the down arrow to select the next page of data for the particular data item. A drop-down
list appears showing the pages available for that data item. A dot indicates the current page
being displayed on the table or cross tab.
       4.5.3.2. Select the page that you want to see next from the drop-down menu. In the
       following figure, the page axis has two data items: SRAN and excess exception code
       (EEX). The SRANS are 2823, 3300, and 5000; the EEXs are 1, 3, 5, and A. Therefore,
       in combination, the Table has 9 pages of data:
SRAN – 2823, EEX – 1
SRAN – 2823, EEX - 3
SRAN – 2823, EEX – 5
SRAN – 2823, EEX – A
SRAN – 3300, EEX – A
SRAN – 5000, EEX – 1
SRAN – 5000, EEX – 3
SRAN – 5000, EEX – 5
SRAN – 5000, EEX – A

Looking at the page labels, you can see that this table shows data for SRAN 2823 and EEX 5.
To see data for other SRANs, click the down arrow in the SRAN item.
A drop-down list shows other items available, in this case the different SRANS. The dot next to
2823 indicates that the table currently displays the page for SRAN 2823 data. To view data for
3300 and 5000, select them from the list.
To see data for other excess exception codes, click the down arrow in the EEX item. Then
choose an EEX from the list.
   4.5.4. Formatting a Worksheet. Part of a Discoverer Administrator's responsibility when
   designing pre-defined workbooks is to format each worksheet. Text fonts, background
   colors, column names, and so forth are all part of the default format set up by the Discoverer
   Administrator. However, you can reformat a worksheet. The following sections describe
   how to do this.
       4.5.4.1. Workbook Wizard. Workbook Wizard provides the Format Panel to help you
       customize the way text, numbers, and dates appear in your worksheets. You can change
       font size, color, and alignment one column at a time or one row at a time. You can even
       select multiple items to format simultaneously. The formats you create using the Format
       Panel apply to one worksheet at a time.
           4.5.4.1.1. Edit worksheet Data Format. To change the format of worksheet data:

4.6. Getting the Data You Want.
   4.6.1. Getting specific data--the data that you want to see--from report’s database involves
   five basic steps:
       4.6.1.1. Open the workbook that contains the data you want. If several workbooks exist,
       you open the one that contains the specific data you want.
       4.6.1.2. As part of the process to open a workbook, select from choices, called
       parameters, which define the precise data you want to see in the workbook. One
       parameter might be the SRAN of the base you want to query.
       4.6.1.3. Reduce the amount of data by using Conditions. Conditions filter data and
       display only the data that meets the conditions.
       4.6.1.4. Create a new workbook, if necessary. If none of the workbooks meet your
       requirements, you can create a new one, customized for displaying exactly the right
       combination of data. To create a new workbook, you must have the appropriate database
       privileges.
       4.6.1.5. Edit a workbook/worksheet, if necessary. Existing workbooks/worksheets may
       require modification in order to meet your needs.
   4.6.2. Opening an Existing Workbook. Your Database Administrator usually supplies the
   various passwords and server access instructions to log on to Oracle Discoverer Plus and
   open a workbook. The following steps explain the basic process.
       4.6.2.1. Connecting to the Oracle Reports Database. To connect to the reports database:
          4.6.2.1.1. Launch your Web browser.

         4.6.2.1.2. Go to the Discoverer Web site address.
         4.6.2.1.3. You may also see a dialog about security. This security dialog appears
         because Discoverer requests extra permissions so it can access the Discoverer server
         or local devices, such as a printer. Note: If you don't want to see this dialog every
         time you connect, click the option "Always trust content from Oracle
         Corporation."Click Yes (or OK or Grant depending on the type of dialog) to continue
         launching Discoverer.
         4.6.2.1.4. Welcome page appears.

      existing workbooks.
         4.6.2.2.1. Opening a Workbook. To open a workbook:
         4.6.2.2.2. Click Open an existing workbook. The dialog then shows options for
         opening a workbook from the database or a scheduled workbook.

Figure 4.27. Open Workbook Dialog Box.




         4.6.2.2.3. Choose one of the following:
            4.6.2.2.3.1. Database: Opens a dialog box for selecting a workbook stored as part
            of a specific database. The workbook can be shared easily with others who have
            access to the database.
            4.6.2.2.3.2. Scheduled: Displays a list of workbooks previously scheduled to run
            at a certain times (usually overnight, on a weekend, or at some periodic interval).
            Scheduled workbooks run automatically and are available when you need to open
            them.

Figure 4.28. Select a Workbook to Open.




         4.6.2.2.4. Depending on your selection, either a list of stored workbooks or a list of
         scheduled workbooks appears. Select a workbook that contains the data you want to
         see, and click Open. The workbook opens. Discoverer evaluates the query to
         determine how much time it will take to open the first worksheet. Depending on the
         default options you've selected for opening worksheets, a progress dialog shows you
         the time estimate for loading the first sheet.
         4.6.2.2.5. A dialog box asks if you want to run the query for the worksheet.

Figure 4.29. Run Query Confirmation.




             4.6.2.2.5.1. A query causes Discoverer to find the most recent data to fill in the
             worksheet. Normally you click “Yes” because you want to see the most recent
             data associated with the sheet. Click No if you don't want to see the data in the
             worksheet. For example, click No if you want to create a new worksheet and
             don't need to see the data on the existing worksheet.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                        161


             4.6.2.2.5.2. Discoverer now evaluates the query to determine how much time it
             will take to open the workbook and shows you an estimate. Click Yes to see the
             data.

Figure 4.30. Time Estimate.




             4.6.2.2.5.3. This dialog box is mainly for your convenience because, if the query
             time is more than a few minutes, you can be doing other work while Discoverer
             gets the data for the worksheet.
                 4.6.2.2.5.3.1. If you can't wait the estimated time, click No. Discoverer will
                 remain open, but the worksheet will be empty.
                 4.6.2.2.5.3.2. If you click Yes, a dialog box shows you the progress and
                 elapsed time while Discoverer is finding the data.

       4.6.2.3. Opening Another Workbook. To open another workbook:
          4.6.2.3.1. From the menu, choose File, and then Close to close the current workbook.
          4.6.2.3.2. Choose File, and then Open. The Open Workbook dialog appears.

Figure 4.33. Open Workbook Dialog Box.




Note: Only one workbook at a time can be open. If you choose File, and then Open while a
workbook is already open, the current workbook closes automatically.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                         163


     4.6.2.4. Viewing Scheduled Workbooks. Scheduled workbooks run at a specified time.
     For example, you might want to automatically run the Stock Number Directory (M14) at
     the end of each month, or run a workbook every week based on the number of special
     inventories. Often, workbooks that you want to schedule are designed specifically for that
     purpose, rather than for your day-to-day analysis. For example, the workbook might
     include special calculations or conditions that produce the results you want on a periodic
     basis only.
        4.6.2.4.1. Discoverer Administrator must provide appropriate privileges to schedule a
        workbook. Typically you schedule workbooks if:
            4.6.2.4.1.1. The workbook will take a long time to run; scheduling a workbook to
            run at night or on the weekend avoids overburdening the server during business
            hours.
            4.6.2.4.1.2. You want to run a workbook at regular intervals, such as a monthly
            M14. Because a scheduled report runs on the server, you do not need to leave
            your computer on overnight (or whenever you schedule the report to run). The
            results of the scheduled report are saved on the server and are available when you
            connect to the database and start Discoverer.
        4.6.2.4.2. A scheduled workbook produces a worksheet or set of worksheets with the
        results derived from running the workbook. You can open a scheduled workbook
        when you start Discoverer, or while working in a workbook. If you run a scheduled
        workbook overnight (or over the weekend) and want to see the results first thing the
        next morning, open the workbook as you connect to Discoverer. To open a scheduled
        workbook:
            4.6.2.4.2.1. Connect to the database and launch Discoverer as described in
            section, “Open an Existing Workbook.”
            4.6.2.4.2.2. Or if you are already connected to the database, from the menus
            choose File, and then Open. The Open Workbook dialog appears.
            4.6.2.4.2.3. Click Scheduled, and then Open. The dialog lists the scheduled
            workbooks.
 164                                                   AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.34. Open Scheduled Workbook Dialog Box.




              4.6.2.4.2.4. Select the scheduled workbook you want to see and click Open.
Note: The worksheets produced by running the scheduled workbook contain data derived
specifically for that report and you can work with the worksheet in the normal manner.
However, if you change any of the data, a message reminds you that the new data on the
worksheet is not the same as that derived from the scheduled workbook.
   4.6.3. Parameters. Databases often contain enormous amounts of information, and one key
   task necessary to work with a database efficiently is to find the specific information you want
   to see or analyze. Discoverer has a number of ways to filter out the data that you don't need
   to see and to find the specific data you want. Discoverer has filtering techniques both when
   you open a workbook initially and as you are working with the data. One way to filter out
   unnecessary data and find the specific information you want when opening a workbook is to
   select and apply parameters.
       4.6.3.1. Parameters offer predefined choices of data when you open a workbook. For
       example, suppose you are located at AFMC with access to data from several accounts.
       You are opening the Stock Number Directory (M14) workbook, but you only want to see
       data from Barksdale AFB. If one of the parameters is "SRAN," you choose the SRAN
       for Barksdale as data values for that parameter. When the workbook opens it shows data
       from only that base--exactly what you want to see. Without the parameter, the workbook
       opens with data from all the bases which you have access.
       4.6.3.2. Parameters actually use “condition” statements to find specific data. However,
       unlike regular conditions that find the same data each time they're applied, parameters
       offer choices at the time the worksheet opens. For example, if the two parameters for a
       worksheet are SRAN and Type Account Code, the underlying condition statement is
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                         165


       "Find all the data about <SRAN> for a <Type Account Code>". The two parameters are
       essentially placeholders in the condition statement until the person opening the worksheet
       picks a data value for each one. Then, Discoverer finds all the data based on the selected
       values. Users are required to make an entry for each parameter prior to running the
       query.
       4.6.3.3. Although similar, parameters and conditions are designed for different purposes.
       Parameters offer you a choice and help you open a workbook quickly to see just the data
       that you want to see. conditions are specific, fixed statements. Conditions are designed
       more for analysis so you can apply condition statements while you are involved with data
       analysis to find very specific sets of data. However, conditions and parameters can also
       be used with each other for more sophisticated filtering procedures. The main benefits of
       using Parameters are:
           4.6.3.3.1. Specific data to see on a worksheet can be chosen.
           4.6.3.3.2. Worksheets open more quickly, because amount of data on a worksheet is
           limited by the choices offered by the parameter.
           4.6.3.3.3. If several people are using a worksheet, each person can open the
           worksheet and get just the data of interest to themselves.
       4.6.3.4. Discoverer users often create parameters when creating the initial workbook.
       However, anyone with the proper access rights (granted by the Discoverer Administrator)
       can create parameters too. The term data values refer to the choices offered when
       creating or choosing parameters. For example, if the parameter is for choosing base(s)
       for which you want to see data, the SRAN(s) are the data values, that is, 3300, 4800,
       5000, etc.
           4.6.3.4.1. Choosing data values for a parameter when a workbook opens. When
           opening a worksheet with predefined parameters, a dialog lists the parameters so you
           can select the ones you want on the worksheet.
Note: Although choosing a data value for a parameter limits the data initially displayed on the
worksheet--for example, you limit the data to “XB3” items only--parameters do not limit the data
available for the worksheet as you are working with it. You can always add any additional data
as you are working on the worksheet. In addition, you can change parameter values every time
the query is refreshed, and you can edit parameter values from the menu.
Depending on the design of the parameters, you can choose:
           4.6.3.4.2. Data value for a single parameter.
           4.6.3.4.3. Multiple data values for a single parameter.
           4.6.3.4.4. Data values for multiple parameters.
       4.6.3.5. To choose a data value for a parameter:
           4.6.3.5.1. Open a worksheet. If parameters are defined for the worksheet, a dialog
           lists the available parameters.
           4.6.3.5.2. Choose a data value for the parameter by doing one of the following:
 166                                                  AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


The worksheet appears and contains data only for the values you chose. In the example below,
the parameter value of SRAN =“2823” is selected. The resulting worksheet contains data only
for Eglin.

         4.6.3.5.3. If the parameter is set up to allow for multiple data values, you can select
         several data values when opening the worksheet. This type of parameter selection
         offers complete flexibility to choose the exact combination of data to see. From the
         Edit Parameter Values dialog, click the drop down arrow and choose Select Multiple
         Values. The Values dialog appears.

          4.6.3.5.4. In the Select Values list, select the check box(es) next to the items that you
          want to see in your Worksheet. To see all Items, click Select All.
          4.6.3.5.5. Click OK on the Values dialog and then click OK on the Parameters
          dialog. The worksheet is refreshed to display only data from the items selected.

         4.6.3.5.6. If the workbook has multiple parameters defined, click the drop down
         arrow next to each parameter and select a data value for each one. The following
         example shows two Parameters--one for bases and the other for type due out--so you
         can select a combination of data to see.

Figure 4.39. Edit Parameter Values Dialog Box with Two Parameters.




       4.6.3.6. Create and edit parameters. Because parameters use condition statements to find
       specific data, creating a parameter is similar to creating a simple condition statement.
       You specify the data item to use for the parameter (for example, the list of SRANs in the
       database) and then specify the choices available for that parameter. In addition to creating
       parameters, you can edit them to change their default values, descriptions, or headings.
       For example, if you find the majority of your work is with a particular base, you may
       want to edit the parameter so that SRAN XXXX is the default value for the SRAN
       parameter.
          4.6.3.6.1. You can create parameters at two levels:
              4.6.3.6.1.1. Workbook level. Here, the parameter applies to all worksheets in
              your workbook. Changes to the parameter in any worksheet cascade to all
              worksheets in the workbook.
              4.6.3.6.1.2. Worksheet level.      Here, the parameter applies to the current
              worksheet only.
          4.6.3.6.2. Create a parameter. To create a new parameter:
              4.6.3.6.2.1. Display the worksheet to which you want to apply the parameter.
              4.6.3.6.2.2. From the menu, choose Tools | Parameters. The Edit Worksheet
              dialog opens with the Parameters tab highlighted.

             4.6.3.6.2.4. Type in or select the features of the parameter.
                4.6.3.6.2.4.1. What do you want to name this parameter? Type the name that
                you want to appear in the Parameters dialog. If you don't type a name,
                Discoverer inserts a default parameter name.
                4.6.3.6.2.4.2. Which item do you want to base your parameter on? Select the
                data item for the Parameter from the drop down list. For example, to create a
                Parameter for selecting a UJC, select the data item that contains the UJCs.
                The list shows the data items currently used in the worksheet. It also shows
                all items related to the items selected in the worksheet and all calculations.
                4.6.3.6.2.4.3. What prompt do you want to show to other users? This text
                appears in the dialog that appears prior to opening the worksheet; type text
                that prompts the user to make a selection.
                4.6.3.6.2.4.4. What description do you want to show to other users? This text
                also appears in the dialog; it explains the Parameter.
                4.6.3.6.2.4.5. What default value do you want to give this Parameter? This is
                the preselected data value for the Parameter. Click the drop down arrow and
                select a data value from the list, or type the default value directly into the box.

                   want the person using the worksheet to be able to select multiple data values
                   for the Parameter when opening the worksheet. If this option is not selected,
                   the person can choose only one value for the Parameter.
                   4.6.3.6.2.4.7. What is the value of this parameter if it is used in more than one
                   sheet? Allows you to create the Parameter either at Workbook level or
                   Worksheet level. Click 'Allow only one value for all Sheets' to make the
                   parameter value cascade across all worksheets in the workbook. Click 'Allow
                   a different value in each Sheet' to make the parameter value apply to the
                   current worksheet only.
                   4.6.3.6.2.4.8. Parameterized Conditions refer to condition statements that use
                   a Parameter in their formulas. For example, if the condition statement uses
                   UJC in its formula, and you select ‘BQ’ as the data value for the Parameter,
                   the condition statement uses BQ as the UJC in the formula.
                   4.6.3.6.2.4.9. Create Condition/Use Operator. Creates a condition with an
                   operator. You can select the operator from the dropdown list. For example,
                   select equals (=) to create a condition with the formula "For Item" =
                   "Parameter's Name." A typical use of this feature is to find data values greater
                   then (>) or less than (<) a data value. For example, to find all the data after
                   the year 1997 the condition formula is "Year" > 1997. The worksheet then
                   appears with data from 1998 on.
Note: If you are creating a parameter as part of a condition, the portion of the dialog for creating
parameterized conditions is not available because you are already defining a condition.
               4.6.3.6.2.5. Click OK. The new Parameter now appears in the Parameters dialog
               box.
Moving the Parameters up and down in the Parameters dialog changes their position in the dialog
that appears when opening a worksheet.
               4.6.3.6.2.6. Click OK in the Edit Worksheet Parameters dialog box.
                   4.6.3.6.2.6.1. The Edit Parameter Values dialog appears, and you can specify
                   the data value. The worksheet now displays the specific result for the data
                   specified in the Edit Parameters dialog.
                   4.6.3.6.2.6.2. Parameters that are part of an active condition are automatically
                   activated as well. If you select the option Create Condition/Use Operator in
                   the New Parameter dialog, a new Condition is created and activated;
                   therefore, the Parameter is also activated.
                   4.6.3.6.2.6.3. To deactivate a parameter, deactivate the condition. Deleting
                   the condition deletes the Parameter and vice versa.
           4.6.3.6.3. Edit a parameter. To edit an existing parameter:

               4.6.3.6.3.2. From the menu, choose Tools, then Parameters. The Edit Worksheet
               dialog opens with the Parameters tab highlighted.

               4.6.3.6.3.4. Type in or select the features of the parameter that you want to
               change.
               4.6.3.6.3.5. Click OK. You return to the Parameters tab.
               4.6.3.6.3.6. Click OK in the Parameters tab to apply your changes.
To select different parameter values:
               4.6.3.6.3.7. From the menu, choose Sheet, then Edit Parameter Values. Edit
               Parameters dialog appears.
Note: You can click the Refresh icon to display the Edit Parameters dialog, (or choose Sheet,
then Refresh Sheet).
               4.6.3.6.3.8. Select a new data value, and click OK. You'll see the results
               corresponding to the data value you have chosen.
   4.6.4. Conditions. Another way to filter out unnecessary data and find the specific
   information you want when opening a workbook is to apply conditions.
 176                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


       4.6.4.1. Conditions also filter the data to display only the exact information you want.
       For example, suppose a workbook contains all “due-outs,” but you only want to see data
       for the Munitions Maintenance Squadron. By applying the condition statement of ORG
       Code=123, the workbook opens and displays data only for that organization. Condition
       statements tell Discoverer to find and display only the data that meets the condition.
       4.6.4.2. Although similar, parameters and conditions are designed for different purposes.
       Parameters offer you a choice and help you open a workbook quickly to see just the data
       that you want to see. Conditions are specific, fixed statements. Conditions are designed
       more for analysis so you can apply condition statements while you are involved with data
       analysis to find very specific sets of data. However, conditions and parameters can also
       be used with each other for more sophisticated filtering procedures.
       4.6.4.3. A typical data analysis task is to filter the data to find only that data that meets
       certain conditions. For example, you might want to limit the display of historical data of
       a stock number to the last two months. Alternatively, you want to see the data for only
       two types of Exception Codes. Each of these tasks involves filtering the data to find the
       specific data that meets the conditions.
          4.6.4.3.1. Some sample conditions are:
Year = 1998 or 1999--The displayed data applies to 1998 and 1999 only. The workbook may
contain data from other years, but it will not be displayed.
          4.6.4.3.2. Extended Price > 3000--The worksheet displays items with an extended
          price greater than $3,000.00.
          4.6.4.3.3. Warehouse Location <> 01%--The worksheet displays data for all items,
          except ones stored in Warehouse 01. Text values in conditional expressions must be
          in single quotes. Normally, Discoverer assigns the single quotes automatically.
          4.6.4.3.4. Several features for creating conditions involve advanced analysis
          techniques. For example, instead of creating a condition for a defined data element,
          you can specify a condition based on a calculated value that computes which data can
          meet the condition.
   4.6.5. Using conditions. Conditions previously defined for a worksheet are listed on the
   Conditions dialog. You can turn these conditions on and off to find the data you want to see.
   Turning a condition on, displays only the data the condition meets. Turning a condition off
   restores the other data to the display. Turning on a condition filters out the data you don't
   want to see. If you want to see all the data again, turn the condition off.
       4.6.5.1. View available conditions. To view available conditions:
          4.6.5.1.1. Choose Tools, then Conditions or click the Condition icon on the Toolbar
          to see the Conditions dialog. The Conditions dialog appears.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                             177

       4.6.5.2. Activate/deactivate conditions. To turn conditions on and off:
           4.6.5.2.1. Choose Tools, and then Conditions or click the Condition tool on the
           Toolbar to see the Conditions dialog. The Conditions dialog lists the conditions
           already defined for your workbook, and shows which are turned on or off.
           4.6.5.2.2. To turn on a condition, click the box next to it so a checkmark appears.
           You can turn on more than one condition at a time. To turn off a condition, click a
           check-marked box to remove the checkmark.
           4.6.5.2.3. Click OK.    Discoverer finds the data that meets the condition(s), and
           displays it.
Note: Do not click the Delete button to turn off a condition. The Delete button permanently
removes the condition from your workbook. If you select two (or more) conditions that conflict,
a warning appears. For example, the two conditions "Demand Level = 2" and "Demand Level =
5" conflict because the first condition removes data for all stock numbers except ones with a
demand level of “2”; the second condition tries to display only stock numbers with a demand
level of “5” at the same time.

Complex conflicts may not be detected. In that case the worksheet appears with no rows of data.
       4.6.5.3. Creating new conditions. If none of the existing conditions filter the data to find
       the specific information that you want to see, you can create your own condition
       statements. This section explains how to create relatively simple condition statements.
       The section, “Grouping Multiple Conditions,” explains how to create more complex
       condition statements. To create a new condition:
           4.6.5.3.1. Choose Tools, and then Conditions, or click the Conditions tool on the
           Toolbar to see the Conditions dialog box.
           4.6.5.3.2. Click the New button to see the New Condition dialog box.

Figure 4.47. New Condition Dialog Box.




         4.6.5.3.3. Type text for the following:
             4.6.5.3.3.1. What would you like to name your condition? Type a name in the
             text box. To automatically generate a name for the condition based on the data
             item, the condition, and the values that you select for it, check the box Generate
             name automatically.
             4.6.5.3.3.2. What description would you like to give your condition? For simple,
             straightforward conditions, the name and description are usually sufficient to
             explain how the condition will filter the data. However, advanced conditions
             might need more detailed descriptions for clarity. Descriptions typed here appear
             in the Conditions dialog when the condition is selected. If you don't enter a
             description, the condition formula automatically appears as the description.
         4.6.5.3.4. Create the formula for the condition statement using the Formula section of
         the dialog. You build or edit a formula by first choosing an item and condition and
         then choosing or entering the appropriate values in the Value(s) text box.
         4.6.5.3.5. Click the drop down button for Item and choose the data item for the first
         part of the Condition formula.

Figure 4.48. Data Items Drop Down List.




             4.6.5.3.5.1. Other options on the drop-down list include Create Calculation and
             Select Condition, which use calculations or other conditions to create the first part
             of the condition. If you are editing an existing condition, the option, Copy
             Condition, appears on the drop-down list. It is for quickly replacing an existing
             condition on the Edit Condition dialog. A list of defined condition appears and
             you can select the one you want. It replaces the currently selected condition in the
             Edit Condition dialog.
             4.6.5.3.5.2. If you select an existing condition as the item, the boxes for the
             condition operator and value are removed because the condition you select is
             already complete. You can then use the condition to create a more advanced
             condition.
          4.6.5.3.6. Click the drop down button for Operator and choose the condition operator
          you want.

          4.6.5.3.7. To complete the definition of the condition click in the Value(s) box and
          enter a data value. The drop-down list of values is a shortcut so you don't have to
          manually type the data value for an item. However, data values for various items
          might or might not appear in the list, depending on whether your Discoverer
          Administrator set up the data element to show a list of values. If clicking the
          Value(s) drop list button shows a list of data values you can then select the value you
          want for the item instead of manually typing it. For example, if the four values for the
          data item named Activity Code are “B,” “D,” “E” and “F,” selecting "Activity Code
          is equal to," and then clicking the drop list button displays B, D, E, and F as the
          choices. See the example below.

               4.6.5.3.7.1. To use the results of a calculation as the value, select Create
               Calculation. A dialog for creating a new calculation appears.
               4.6.5.3.7.2. To use another item as the condition's value, choose Select Item. A
               list of the items in the worksheet appears and you can select an item from the list.
               4.6.5.3.7.3. If the selected item for the condition has parameters defined for it,
               you can choose the option Select parameter from the drop-down list to select an
               existing parameter for the item.
               4.6.5.3.7.4. If the condition requires more than one value, you can choose Select
               Multiple Values from the drop-down list. A list of data values appears and you
               can select the ones you want.
               4.6.5.3.7.5. You can also create new parameters for the item by selecting New
               Parameter from the drop-down list. The dialog for creating new parameters
               appears.
Note: If you use parameters in a condition, the parameter appears in the formula with a colon in
front of it, such as ": my Parameter." If you are using calculations, the calculation appears with
an equals sign in front of it so Discoverer knows it is a calculation. The condition will then
substitute the results of the calculation for the item or value where you specified a calculation.
Using the equals sign you can also type a calculation directly into the Item box or Value box,
such as "=Item Table.Demand Level. = Item Table.Serviceable Balance."
           4.6.5.3.8. If you are dealing with text and want the condition to match the uppercase
           and lowercase characters in the text, click the box for Match Case. For example, if
           you want the condition to filter the data to find all "Widgets" but not "widgets," click
           the Match Case box.
           4.6.5.3.9. Click OK. The new condition appears in the Conditions dialog and is
           turned on ready to be applied to the data. Click OK in the Conditions dialog to see
           the data that meets the condition.
           4.6.5.3.10. Click OK in the Conditions dialog to see the data that meets the
           condition.

                                  to create a complex conditional value, Discoverer can
                                  recognize it regardless of which expression you use in
                                  the program.
       4.6.5.5. Grouping multiple conditions. You can group multiple condition statements.
       Conditions consisting of multiple statements are connected using the AND/OR operators.
       You can also nest statements; so one statement is contained within the definition of
       another statement.
There is no “NOT” operator, but you can create negated conditions by using complementary
operators. Some examples:
             4.6.5.5.1. Find stock numbers with Warner Robins AFB as the source of supply and
             serviceable balance greater than 10. The condition statement is: Serviceable Balance
             >10 AND Routing Identifier= ‘FLZ’. Stock numbers from other RIDs and with a
             serviceable balance less than 10 are not displayed.
             4.6.5.5.2. Find stock numbers with Tinker AFB as the source of supply, and all stock
             numbers with a budget code equal to ‘8’ regardless of the source of supply. The
             condition statement is: Budget Code = 8 OR Routing Identifier= ‘FHZ’. The data
             display shows stock numbers with budget code of ‘8’ regardless of RID, and all those
             with a RID of ‘FHZ’.
       4.6.5.6. Group multiple conditions. To group multiple conditions:
             4.6.5.6.1. In the New Condition dialog, click the Advanced button. The Advanced
             Conditions dialog appears.

         4.6.5.6.2. Discoverer adds Insert buttons for New Item, And and Or. You use these
         buttons to create the advanced condition.
         4.6.5.6.3. Create the first line of the condition. In the example above it is Budget
         Code = ‘S’.
         4.6.5.6.4. Click the New Item button to add another line to the condition statement.
AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013                                                           185


Figure 4.52. Example of Advanced Condition Statement.




           4.6.5.6.5. Notice the new Group column added at the left side of the dialog. The
           Group column indicates how the statements are grouped by the operator. By default,
           when you first write multiple statements they are grouped with the logical AND
           operator. To change the group operator to OR, NOT AND, or NOT OR, click the
           drop-down menu next to it.
               4.6.5.6.5.1. Create the second line of the condition. Discoverer displays the
               formula at the bottom of the dialog so you can verify that the statement's logical
               construction is correct.
               4.6.5.6.5.2. Click OK to save the multi-statement condition.
Note: You can drag conditions and items on the dialog. Dragging Condition A onto Condition
B replaces Condition B with Condition A. You can also select Copy Condition from the Item
drop-down list. In that case, the values of the copied condition replace the values of the selected
condition.
           4.6.5.6.6. The operators can also be "nested" to several levels to group multiple
           conditions. For example, the condition to find stock numbers with demand levels
           greater than 5 and ERRCD XD2 or ones with demand levels greater than 5 with
 186                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4            8 AUGUST 2013


           budget code 8 for any ERRCD is: Demand Level>5 AND (ERRCD='XD2' OR
           Budget Code=8). To nest multiple conditions:
               4.6.5.6.6.1. Click the column handle next to the group operator.
               4.6.5.6.6.2. Click the And or Or button to add another group to the condition.

Figure 4.53. Example of Condition Nesting.




               4.6.5.6.6.3. The formula at the bottom of the dialog shows the new statement
               construction.
Notes:
1. Using the AND/OR operators can be tricky, especially when grouping statements. Check the
data carefully to see if the condition produces the desired result.
2. If you delete a condition, the Undo button becomes active, so you can restore it if you need to.
Undo only works after a deletion.
               4.6.5.6.6.4. Click OK to save the multi-statement condition.
       4.6.5.7. Applying conditions to worksheets. To apply an existing condition:
           4.6.5.7.1. When you finish creating a condition, Discoverer checkmarks it to indicate
           it is ready to be applied to the data.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                         187


Figure 4.54. Apply Existing Condition.




           4.6.5.7.2. Click OK to apply the condition to the data and see the results.
       4.6.5.8. Editing and deleting conditions. If a condition statement does not find the exact
       data you want, you can edit the statement. For example, if the statement finds data for
       budget code 8, but your query now requires data for budget codes 8 & 9, you can edit the
       condition to find the newer data. Deleting a condition removes it permanently from the
       workbook. However, because you can turn conditions on and off, you may not want to
       delete a condition in case you'll need it in the future.
           4.6.5.8.1. Edit a condition. To edit a condition:
              4.6.5.8.1.1. Choose Tools, and then Conditions, or click the Conditions tool on
              the Toolbar. The Conditions dialog appears.
              4.6.5.8.1.2. Select the condition in the Conditions dialog.
              4.6.5.8.1.3. Click the Edit button. The Edit Condition dialog appears.
Note: You cannot edit conditions created by the Discoverer Administrator. If you select one of
these conditions, the Edit button changes to Show. You can click the Show button to review the
condition and see its formula, but you cannot make changes. In addition, advanced conditions
containing sub queries created in Discoverer 4.1., cannot be reviewed or edited. A message tells
you that the condition cannot be reviewed or edited. You can still turn these conditions on and
off, however, to analyze your data in the way you want.

              4.6.5.8.1.4. Make the changes you want to the condition.
              4.6.5.8.1.5. Click OK. The condition is now edited.
              4.6.5.8.1.6. To apply that edited condition to the data, make sure it is checked on
              and click OK.
           4.6.5.8.2. Delete a condition. To delete a condition:
              4.6.5.8.2.1. Choose Tools, and then Conditions, or click the Conditions tool on
              the Toolbar. The Conditions dialog appears.
              4.6.5.8.2.2. Select the condition you want to delete.
              4.6.5.8.2.3. Click the Delete button. Discoverer removes the condition from the
              list.
   4.6.6. Create a New Workbook. Discoverer Administrator at AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity creates worksheets and workbooks for use by all Air Force Supply
   personnel. However, while working with Discoverer, you may want to create additional
   workbooks and worksheets. For example, you may want to create a special worksheet as a
   scheduled report that gets printed each week as part of your local inventory management. On
   the other hand, you may want to consolidate Requisition Analysis information in a separate
   workbook that you share with all bases in a MAJCOM. If you have the appropriate access
   rights (usually granted by the database administrator), you can use the steps explained in this
   chapter to create workbooks and worksheets.
Note: The same process is used to create workbooks and worksheets. In fact, to create a new
workbook, you create the initial worksheet for the new workbook. Thus, the steps described in
this section are for both processes--building a new workbook and building a new worksheet.
       4.6.6.1. Table Joins. Before a user can select data from different folders, a relationship
       must exist between those different data elements. These relationships are created in
       Discoverer with “Joins.” A “Join” serves several purposes: 1) Links different tables
       (Folders) together; 2) Provides a relationship between different tables; 3) Provides logical
       pairing of tables in a database on matching data in specific columns. When a user selects
       an item or folder to create a worksheet, only those folders with a Join (relationship) with
       the selected folder are available. Every other folder is inaccessible (grayed-out).
       4.6.6.2. Discoverer uses two types of “Joins”: 1) Inner (Natural) and 2) Outer.
           4.6.6.2.1. Inner-Join is based on a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship. It will
           retrieve all rows from one table and any matching rows from another table. When
           values in two tables match, they are combined and displayed as one row.
              4.6.6.2.1.1. For example: An Inner-Join between the requisition number on the
              due-out detail and the requisition number on the due-in detail will only return
              due-outs that have requisition numbers.
              4.6.6.2.1.2. For example: An Inner-Join between the stock number on the item
              record and the stock number on the supply point detail will return only those stock
              numbers that have a supply point detail assigned.
AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013                                                           189


           4.6.6.2.2. An Outer-Join is based on a one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-none
           relationship. It will retrieve all rows from one table and any matching rows from
           another table. When values in two tables match, they are combined and displayed as
           one row. It will also display all rows from one table even if the joined table does not
           have a matching value.
               4.6.6.2.2.1. For example: An Outer-Join between the requisition number on the
               due-out detail and the requisition number on the due-in detail will return due-outs
               that have requisition numbers and due-outs without requisition numbers.
               4.6.6.2.2.2. For example: An Outer-Join between the stock number on the item
               record and the stock number on the supply point detail will return all stock
               numbers, with or without a supply point detail assigned.
       4.6.6.3. Create a new workbook. Basic steps to create a new workbook or worksheet are
       as follows:
           4.6.6.3.1. Required Steps:
               4.6.6.3.1.1. Select the type of display for the new worksheet or workbook.
               4.6.6.3.1.2. Select the data that belongs on the worksheet or in the workbook.
           4.6.6.3.2. Optional Steps:
               4.6.6.3.2.1. Arrange the data on a table or cross tab layout.
               4.6.6.3.2.2. Sort the data.
               4.6.6.3.2.3. Select conditions to apply to the data.
               4.6.6.3.2.4. Select calculations to apply to the data.
           4.6.6.3.3. To create a new workbook or worksheet:
               4.6.6.3.3.1. Choose either of the following:
                  4.6.6.3.3.1.1. Choose Sheet, and then New Sheet to build a new worksheet.
                  4.6.6.3.3.1.2. Choose File, and then New to create a new workbook.
Note: The sample dialogs in this section are for creating a new worksheet. The dialogs for
creating a new workbook are the same, except the dialog titles are "Create Workbook" instead of
"Create Worksheet." Worksheet Wizard Create/Open Workbook dialog appears. This dialog is
where you select the layout--table or cross tab--which you want to use to display the data on the
new worksheet.
               4.6.6.3.3.2. Click the radio button for the type of display for the new worksheet.
               As you select each type, the corresponding description is displayed as well.

            4.6.6.3.3.3. Click Next. The Workbook Wizard: Select Items dialog appears. It
            is used for selecting the data that you want on the new worksheet.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                          191

Figure 4.57. See Available Items.




             4.6.6.3.3.4. Select the business area from the drop-down menu at the top of the
             Available list.
             4.6.6.3.3.5. Click the plus (+) sign next to a folder to see all of the items in it.
             Folders containing items available for the current worksheet are active. Others
             are grayed out. If a relationship does not exist between the two folders, they are
             displayed as inactive. Items may have plus signs next to them as well, indicating
             you can select values for those items as well. For example, freeze code item
             contains the names of the various freeze codes in the database. You can select a
             specific freeze code to add to the worksheet. By doing this, you are implicitly
             creating and activating the condition `Freeze Code' = <name>.
             4.6.6.3.3.6. From the list of available data items, select the specific data items to
             add to your worksheet. ‘Shift-click’ on items to select multiple items. ‘Ctrl-click’
             to select items not adjacent to one another. The Right Arrow (Add) button in the
             middle of the dialog becomes active.
             4.6.6.3.3.7. Click Right Arrow (Add) button to move the available items to the
             Selected list. Those items are then the data items for the new worksheet. You can
             also drag the selected items from the Available list to the Selected list. The
             following example shows several items moved to the Selected list.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                            193


Figure 4.58. Example of Selected Items.




                 4.6.6.3.3.7.1. You can select data at various levels in the Available list.
                  4.6.6.3.3.7.1.1. For example: selecting a folder and moving it to the selected
                  list, moves all the data within the folder to the list. Similarly, moving an
                  item to the Selected list moves all values in it to the list and, ultimately, to
                  the worksheet.
                  4.6.6.3.3.7.1.2. For example, moving the Budget Code item to the Selected
                  list, results in all budget code values appearing on the worksheet. Moving a
                  numeric item to the Selected list automatically includes its default
                  aggregation functions. All values are automatically included as well.
                  Selecting and moving an axis item, however, does not automatically include
                  aggregate functions. To remove an item from the Selected list, click it and
                  drag it back to the Available list, or click the Left Arrow (Remove) button.
             4.6.6.3.3.8. Depending on the items you select from multiple folders, you may
             see a dialog that asks you to identify the manner in which the folders are joined.
             This means there are multiple ways of combining the items they contain and you
             select which method is used.

Figure 4.59. Join Folders Dialog Box.




              4.6.6.3.3.9. At this point, you can click Finish to create a new worksheet.
              Clicking Next, shows the next (optional) page for adding other features to the new
              worksheet.
   4.6.7. Editing a Worksheet. To edit a worksheet:
       4.6.7.1. Open the worksheet you want to edit.
       4.6.7.2. Click the Edit Sheet icon on the toolbar, or choose Sheet, and then Edit Sheet.
       Edit Sheet dialog appears.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                             195


Figure 4.60. Edit Worksheet Dialog Box.




           4.6.7.2.1. The Figure above is for editing a tabular worksheet. A similar dialog
           appears for cross tab worksheets, except Table Layout tab becomes Cross tab Layout
           and the dialog does not include the Sort tab. To sort cross tab data, choose Tools, and
           then Sort.
       4.6.7.3. Adding and deleting items on a worksheet. First tab on the Edit Sheet dialog is
       for adding or deleting items on a worksheet. For example, if the original worksheet did
       not contain the item “Demand Level,” you can add an item for the demand level.
Adding a new item to a worksheet inserts a column to the table or a row or column to a cross tab.
           4.6.7.3.1. Add an item to current worksheet.            To add an item to the current
           worksheet:
              4.6.7.3.1.1. Click the plus (+) sign next to folders and items to see their contents.
              4.6.7.3.1.2. Select the item in the Available list.
              4.6.7.3.1.3. Click the Right Arrow button or drag the item to the Selected list.
              4.6.7.3.1.4. Delete an Item from Current Worksheet.
           4.6.7.3.2. To delete an item from the current worksheet:
              4.6.7.3.2.1. Select the item in the selected list.
              4.6.7.3.2.2. Click the Left Arrow button.

You can also delete items from a worksheet using the Table Layout tab or the Cross tab Layout
tab. Click on the item, depress the Delete key.
       4.6.7.4. Changing a worksheet’s layout. You can rearrange and pivot the page items,
       axis items, and columns on a worksheet by editing the layout. To change a Worksheet’s
       Layout:
          4.6.7.4.1. Open the worksheet that you want to edit.
          4.6.7.4.2. Click the Edit Sheet icon on the toolbar, or choose Sheet, and then Edit
          Sheet.
          4.6.7.4.3. Click the Table Layout tab or Cross tab Layout tab. The layout shows the
          current arrangement of the items on the worksheet.

          4.6.7.4.4. Select one of the items on the layout.
          4.6.7.4.5. Drag the item to its new position on the layout. A black line on the
          top/bottom/side of an adjacent item shows where the items will be located when you
          release the mouse button.
          4.6.7.4.6. Release the mouse button when the item is in its new position.
          4.6.7.4.7. To delete an item from the layout, select it and click the Delete key on the
          keyboard.
Following examples on the Table layout show:
              4.6.7.4.7.1. Moving the Exception Code column to the right to become the

              to open the worksheet.
       4.6.7.6. Saving a Workbook. Saving a workbook saves all of its changes. It is important
       to note the author of a workbook is the only one who can “Save” changes to the
       workbook using its current name. Anyone other than the author can only “Save” changes
       made to the workbook using a different workbook name (“Save As”).
          4.6.7.6.1. To save a workbook:
Choose one of the following:
              4.6.7.6.1.1. Choose File, and then Save. The changes are saved and the workbook
              remains open (author of the workbook only).
              4.6.7.6.1.2. To close and save a workbook at the same time, choose File, and then
              Close. If you haven't made changes to any worksheet in the workbook, it closes.
              If the workbook contains any unsaved changes on any worksheet, a dialog
              reminds you to save the changes (author of the workbook only).

       4.6.7.7. Refreshing Data in a Workbook. Data in a workbook appears as the result of
       querying the database at a particular time. To refresh the data, you re-query the database.
       Refreshing often applies to databases receiving data from online transactions or other
       dynamic sources. Refreshing the data ensures that the information you are viewing is up-
       to-date.
           4.6.7.7.1. To refresh data in a worksheet:
 202                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


Choose Sheet, and then Refresh Sheet. Discoverer displays the worksheet results based on the
updated data.
       4.6.7.8. Deleting a Workbook. Deleting a workbook permanently removes it. You
       should not delete a workbook unless you are certain you won't need it in the future. To
       delete a workbook:
           4.6.7.8.1. Choose File | Manage Workbooks | Delete. Delete Workbook from
           Database dialog box appears and lists the workbooks currently in the database.

Figure 4.67. Delete Workbooks from Database Dialog Box.




           4.6.7.8.2. Click the name of the workbook you want to delete, and then click Delete.
4.7. Presenting Data on a Graph. A graph is a pictorial presentation of numeric data. A graph
is also an analysis tool used to visually highlight relationships or trends. Types of graphs include
area, bar, line, pie, scatter graphs, and others. Values from worksheets, or data points, are
displayed as bars, lines, pie slices, etc.
Discoverer provides the Graph Wizard to help you create and edit graphs. A series of dialogs
takes you through the processes of choosing the data you want to graph, what kind of graph you
want, and how the graph should look.
   4.7.1. About Worksheets and Graphs. Each Discoverer worksheet can have one graph. If
   you already have a graph in a worksheet and want create a completely new graph, you can
   either:
       4.7.1.1. First delete the existing graph, and then create a new graph.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                             203


       4.7.1.2. Duplicate the worksheet to create a new worksheet, and then create a graph for
       the new worksheet, (using the options Sheet, and then Duplicate as Table and Sheet, and
       then Duplicate as Cross tab).
   4.7.2. Graphing Terminology. Terminology below appears in the Graph Wizard:
       4.7.2.1. Group. In a graph, a group is a subset of the displayed data, generally Markers
       that are connected to each other or are aligned with each other. For example, in a stacked
       bar graph, each stack of bars is a group.
       4.7.2.2. Marker. A Marker is a graphical object that represents data values. Data
       Markers can be bars (in bar graphs), lines (in line graphs), slices (in pie graphs), areas (in
       area graphs), or data points (in scatter graphs). Markers of the same shape and color are
       referred to as a data series.
       4.7.2.3. Label. Labels are text attached to graph Markers. For example, if your bar
       graph shows count of stock numbers for a particular budget code, labels at the top of each
       bar would show the total count for each budget code. Both the X-axis and the Y-axis can
       have labels. Even the individual slices of a pie chart can have labels.
   4.7.3. Choosing Best Type of Graph for Your Data. To present your worksheet data visually
   in Discoverer, you can choose from 12 graph types: For example, Bar Graph, Line Graph,
   and Pie Graph. Each graph type has one or more variations, or sub-types. For example, the
   Area Graph has three sub-types: Area, Percent Area, and Stacked Area.
Most graph subtypes have a three-dimensional effect that you can switch on and off as required
(using the 3D-Effect check box).
Note: The 3D-Effect should not be confused with three-dimensional graphs, such as 3D-Cube
and Surface, which are used to represent multi-dimensional data.
Some graphs also have dual-Y subtypes, which have two Y-axes. Dual-Y graphs are useful for
showing data of different measures (such as Sales on the Y1-axis and Profit on the Y2-axis) or
data of different scales (such as Region Sales on the Y1-axis and Percent of Total Sales on the
Y2-axis).
   4.7.4. Graph Types Described.
       4.7.4.1. Bar graph: A graph that compares values using vertical bars. A single bar
       represents each value. A bar graph shows variation over a period or illustrates
       comparisons between values. The stacked subtype shows each value's relationship to a
       whole.
       4.7.4.2. Horizontal Bar graph: Identical to a bar graph except that the bars lie
       horizontally, rather than standing vertically. Horizontal bars place more emphasis on
       comparisons and less emphasis on time. The stacked subtype shows each value's
       relationship to a whole.
       4.7.4.3. Line graph: A graph that shows trends or changes in data at even intervals.
       Data is represented as a line that connects a series of data points. Although similar to an
       area graph, a line graph emphasizes trends.
204                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


      4.7.4.4. Point graph: Similar to a line graph in that data is represented by points,
      however the data points are not connected by a line.
      4.7.4.5. Area graph: A type of graph in which data is represented as a filled-in area.
      4.7.4.6. Pie graph: A graph in which data is represented as sections of a circle, making
      the circle look like a sliced pie. A pie graph shows the proportion of parts to a whole. It
      is useful for emphasizing a significant element, such as the highest value. Note that a pie
      graph always displays only one data series, that is, one row or one column of data at a
      time.
      4.7.4.7. Polar graph: A circular scatter graph. The circular shape allows you to present
      cyclical data and is especially useful for showing directional data.
      4.7.4.8. Scatter graph: A graph with points scattered over the plot area. Each point is a
      value whose coordinates are specified by two numeric measures. A scatter graph shows
      relationships between two measures, for example Sales and Cost. A scatter graph is
      useful for comparing two measures that both have many values. All points are the same
      size, regardless of their value.
      4.7.4.9. Bubble graph: Bubble graphs add another measure to the points of a scatter
      graph because the size of the bubble is significant. Each bubble is a value whose
      coordinates are specified by three numeric measures. A bubble graph shows
      relationships between three measures, for example Quarter, Sales, and Profit. The third
      measure determines the size of the bubble. A bubble graph is useful for comparing three
      measures that have many values.
      4.7.4.10. Stock graph: A graph in which each data Marker typically shows three values,
      such as the high, low, and closing stock price. Stock graphs are useful for comparing the
      prices of different stocks or the stock price of an individual stock over time.
      4.7.4.11. 3D graph: A true three-dimensional graph, where you can see an X edge, a Y
      edge, and a Z edge. 3D graphs have a floor, a wall, and a background. There are four 3D
      graph subtypes: 3D Bar, 3D Cube, 3D Area, and 3D Surface. These types of 3D graphs
      are useful for showing trends or to compare values. Note, this graph type is not the same
      as one created using the 3D Effect checkbox. The 3D Effect checkbox allows you to add
      depth to any graph type.
      4.7.4.12. Notes on creating graphs. To create meaningful graphs in Discoverer, you need
      to have the correct Worksheet configuration for the style of graph that you wish to use.
      This section contains advice on getting the best results when using graphs in Discoverer.
      4.7.4.13. Creating bubble graphs.      When you create bubble graphs, follow these
      guidelines:
         4.7.4.13.1. You need at least three Items.
         4.7.4.13.2. X Item- the bubble’s location on the X-axis.
         4.7.4.13.3. Y Item- the bubble’s location on the Y-axis.
         4.7.4.13.4. Z Item - the size of the bubbles, (which should be positive numbers).
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                       205


Figure 4.68. Example Data Configuration for a Bubble Graph.




      4.7.4.14. Creating stock charts. When you create high-low-close stock graphs, follow
      these guidelines:
      4.7.4.14.1.   You need at least three items in the following order:
             4.7.4.14.1.1. High price
             4.7.4.14.1.2. Low price
             4.7.4.14.1.3. Closing price
             4.7.4.14.1.4. Stock values for High, Low, and Closing prices must appear on the
             same row or column series as groups of three.
         4.7.4.14.2. To display data for more than one period, the data must be in multiples of
         three, such as three columns for period 1, three columns for period 2, and so on.
             4.7.4.14.2.1. High-low-close stock graphs usually have only one series of data.
             The series should be the name of the stock whose prices you show in the graph.
             4.7.4.14.2.2. If a high-low stock graph contains more than one series of data, and
             prices overlap, some stock markers will obscure other stock markers.
             4.7.4.14.2.3. For example, Figure 4.69 shows a worksheet configuration for
             charting a stock price over time, (January, February and March). Worksheet data
             arranged 'Series by row.'
 206                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.69. Example Data Configuration for a High-Low Stock Chart.




       4.7.4.15. Creating dual-Y charts. When you create graphs with dual-Y series, follow
       these guidelines. The dual-Y facility can be used with bar, line, or area graph types. Dual-
       Y graphs require at least two series of data. By default, the series are displayed in the
       following way:
           4.7.4.15.1. Series 1 is displayed on the Y1 axis.
           4.7.4.15.2. Series 2 is displayed on the Y2 axis.
           4.7.4.15.3. All subsequent series are displayed on the Y1 axis.
           4.7.4.15.4. In Figure 4.68, the Y1 axis represents Sales on the scale 0 to 1 million.
           The Y2 axis represents Costs on the scale 0 to 50,000. The Plot Area tab of the
           Graph Wizard can be used to change, which Y-axis is used for each series.

          label should appear on top of a marker or inside a marker (for example, on top of a
          bar or inside a bar), click the Options button next to this selection.
          4.7.5.18.3. Insert a checkmark to add text that pops-up whenever you hover the
          mouse over a data marker. Click the Options button next to this selection to decide
          what text to display in the pop-up. Select options, such as color, for series (rows or
          columns from your worksheet) that are displayed in your graph. For a dual-Y graph,
          select which axis to use for each series.

   automatically when you save the worksheet.
   4.7.10. Deleting Your Graph.
       4.7.10.1. To delete your graph
           4.7.10.1.1. From the Graph menu, choose Delete Graph.             A warning message
           appears.
           4.7.10.1.2. Click Yes to delete the graph.
4.8. Analyzing Data. This chapter explains how to find and arrange the data that you want to
analyze.
   4.8.1. Pivoting Data. Pivoting organizes data by moving items from the main body of a
   table worksheet to the page axis. On a cross tab worksheet, you have even more control over
   the elements you can pivot. For example, you can move data items from the main body of
   the cross tab worksheet to the page axis, side axis, or top axis.
Laying out data on a table or cross tab organizes it so you can easily compare results side by side,
spot trends when you see progressions, track progress over weeks, months and years, and so on.
In other words, how the data is arranged is an important aid to analysis because it reveals data
relationships that may not be apparent.
One way to think about pivoting data is to visualize the data plotted on a graph, and then
switching data from the X-axis to the Y-axis.
       4.8.1.1. Pivoting data on a table.
To pivot an item on a table:
           4.8.1.1.1. Open the table with the data you want to pivot.
 216                                                 AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


          4.8.1.1.2. From the menu, choose Sheet, and then Table Layout, or click the Layout
          icon on the toolbar. The Edit Sheet dialog appears with the Table Layout tab
          selected. The layout shows the items on the table and their current positions on the
          table.
          4.8.1.1.3. Drag the column to its new location, represented by a black bar, and
          release the mouse button. The following example shows how to pivot the Unit of
          Issue column to the Page Axis.

Figure 4.79. Pivoting Items on a Table.




          4.8.1.1.4. The Unit of Issue column moves to the Page Axis on the Worksheet. The
          following example (Figure 4.79) shows what the worksheet looks like before and
          after pivoting the Unit of Issue item to the page axis.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                         217


Figure 4.80. Worksheets after Pivoting Data on a Table.




      4.8.1.2. As you can see, putting the Unit of Issue on the Page axis means that only one
      Unit of Issue at a time appears on each page of the worksheet. To see the data from other
      Unit of Issues, select a new one from the Unit of Issue drop-down list, as shown in the
      following figure.
 218                                                   AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.81. Page Item Drop-Down List.




          4.8.1.2.1. Pivoting Data on a Cross-Tab. Because the data relationships on a cross
          tab depend on the intersection of the axis items, pivoting data from one axis to
          another creates a new set of data relationships. In addition, the new arrangement can
          add levels of data to an axis. For example, if the data on the side axis is for Function
          Number, pivoting the Reject Number data item to the side axis adds another level of
          data to that axis.
          4.8.1.2.2. Use the same drag-and-drop process to move a data item from one axis to
          another on a cross tab, just as you do to move the columns on a table as shown above.
       4.8.1.3. To pivot an item on a cross tab:
          4.8.1.3.1. Open the cross tab with the data you want to rearrange.
          4.8.1.3.2. From the menu, choose Sheet, and then Cross tab Layout. The Edit Sheet
          dialog appears with the Cross tab Layout tab selected. The example (Figure 4.81)
          below shows a Cross-tab Worksheet and its Cross tab Layout arrangement.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                        219


Figure 4.82. Example Cross Tab Worksheet & Layout.




         4.8.1.3.3. Select the item to pivot. You can pivot among the page axis, top axis, and
         side axis.
         4.8.1.3.4. Drag the item to its new location, represented by a black bar, and release
         the mouse button. Click OK.
         4.8.1.3.5. In the example below (Figure 4.83), the Reject Number Item has been
         pivoted to the left-hand axis. You can then make more direct comparisons between
         types of Rejects for each Function as they appear on the same axis.

       4.8.1.4. Duplicating Tables and Cross Tabs. Duplicating tables and cross tabs provides a
       quick, easy way to present still more perspectives on the data. You might, for example,
       want to duplicate an existing table so that you can use the analytical properties offered by
       pivoting on a cross tab layout or vice versa.
          4.8.1.4.1. To duplicate a cross tab as a table, or vice versa:
              4.8.1.4.1.1. Open the worksheet that you want to duplicate.
              4.8.1.4.1.2. From the menu choose Sheet, and then Duplicate a Table or Sheet,
              and then Duplicate as Cross tab. The dialog box for duplicating the table or cross
              tab appears. The dialog box appears with the Table Layout tab or Cross Tab
              Layout tab selected depending on the duplication you're doing.
              4.8.1.4.1.3. Indicate which items you want to display in the new table or cross
              tab.
              4.8.1.4.1.4. Show Page Items--show/hide the page items box on the table or cross
AFH23-123V2PT4           8 AUGUST 2013                                                          221


               tab. If page items already exist for the worksheet, Discoverer disables this option
               and shows the page items portion of the worksheet.
               4.8.1.4.1.5. Arrange the columns and page items so the duplicated table or cross
               tab appears as you want it. Click OK.
   4.8.2. Drilling Into and Out of Data.
Drilling helps, you easily locate related information in a worksheet. For example, suppose you're
analyzing data showing activity at a quarterly (3 months) level. To see the data at a higher level,
such as yearly, you can drill out of that information. Similarly, if you want to analyze the data at
a monthly level, you can drill into that level.
Drilling out of data consolidates the data for a broader overview.
Drilling into data shows more details about the data. So, drill into data to analyze it at a finer
level of detail, and drill out to get the larger picture.
Discoverer provides drill icons to quickly and easily drill up or down in a table or cross tab. You
can use drill icons to drill through data in several ways.
Any data item that permits drilling has a drill icon on the worksheet. You can use the drill icon
to drill up or down through the data structure. The drill icons are the small arrowheads next to
the column headings.
       4.8.2.1. To drill into or out of data.
To drill into or out of data from the table or cross tab:
           4.8.2.1.1. Click the drill icon in the column or row with the data that you want to
           drill.
A drop-down menu appears for the item. For example, if you click the drill icon for City, the
drop-down menu shows that you can drill down to the Store Names within the city or up to the
Region in which the city is located.
           4.8.2.1.2. From the drop-down menu, choose the level of data to which you want to
           drill up or down.
               4.8.2.1.2.1. To drill down, select one of the levels below the current level. In the
               example you would select Store Name.
               4.8.2.1.2.2. To drill back up, select one of the levels above the current level. In
               the example, you would select Region.
               4.8.2.1.2.3. If you're drilling down, Discoverer finds the more detailed data
               specified by the drill and displays it on the worksheet.
               4.8.2.1.2.4. If you're drilling up, Discoverer consolidates the data into a more
               concise worksheet.
       4.8.2.2. Collapsing drilled items. If you select a data item to which you have already
       drilled down, you can collapse the levels back to their previous state.
           4.8.2.2.1. To collapse drilled data:
 222                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


               4.8.2.2.1.1. Select a value above the current value from the drop-down menu.
Note: Data on a worksheet is often organized in the hierarchical sequence. Typically, you
would drill, for example, from Region to City and then from City to Store Name. However, in
some instances, you might want to drill to data out of that sequence. That is, you might want
drill into the data from Region directly to Store Name while skipping the drill to City. This can
also be thought of as skipping a hierarchical level. To drill to another level out of sequence,
simply select the level you want from the drop-down menu.
   4.8.3. Sorting Data. Sorting arranges text data in alphabetical order and numeric data in
   numerical order. Creating an ordered list of stock numbers, exception coded items, or
   product part numbers are typical uses of sorting. However, sorting is also helpful for
   analyzing data. For example, sorting inventory data from most accurate to least accurate
   shows potential problem areas within an account. In either case, you can sort the data from
   Low to High--which is A to Z or 1 to 10, or High to Low--Z to A or 10 to 1.
       4.8.3.1. Simple table sorting. Use the Sort dialog to select the data to sort and the sort
       order.
In the following example, the primary sorted data is Urgency of Justification Code (UJC), which
is sorted alphabetically. UJC is sorted Lo to Hi, which for text data is alphabetical from A to Z.
AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013                                                     223


Figure 4.84. Example of Simple Table Sort.




To sort a single column of data on a table:
           4.8.3.1.1. Open the table with the data you want to sort.
           4.8.3.1.2. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Sort or click the sort icon on the
           tool bar. Sort Table dialog box appears. It shows the sorting options currently
           selected for the table.

Figure 4.85. Sort Dialog Box.




          4.8.3.1.3. Click the Add button and choose the data item from the drop-down list that
          you want to use for sorting the data. The item is added to the column.
          4.8.3.1.4. Click the Directions drop-down list and select the sort order.
              4.8.3.1.4.1. Lo to Hi--A to Z for text; increasing for numbers (e.g., 1 to 10).
              4.8.3.1.4.2. Hi to Lo--Z to A for text; decreasing for numbers (e.g., 10 to 1).
          4.8.3.1.5. Click the Group drop-down list and select an option for group sorting. See
          the section, “Group Sorting” for details.
          4.8.3.1.6. Click the Hidden box to hide the data item being used for sorting. For
          example, you could designate a sort order by UJC, but not show the UJC column.
          4.8.3.1.7. Click OK. The data is sorted on the table.
       4.8.3.2. Group Sorting. Group sorting displays each data value at the top row of a group.
       In the following figure, the table on the top is group sorted by budget code (BC) so the
       BC only appears at the first stock number where the BC changes. The table on the
       bottom is also sorted by BC, but is not group sorted. In this case, the BC appears next to
       each row of data.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                         225


Figure 4.86. Example of Group Sorting.




One key reason to sort data by groups is to find subtotals for groups of numerical data. See
section “Creating a New Total” for steps to add subtotals and totals to data sorted by groups.
Group sorting is also pertinent when finding percentages. When you specify percentages for
numbers (for example, the percentage of stock numbers in each account with a particular
ERRCD), the data is automatically group sorted for that section of data (e.g., the ERRCDs) so
the percentages can be displayed properly. See the section “Creating a New Percentage” for
more information.
Note: Data can be group sorted on table worksheets, but not on cross tab worksheets. You can
also sort data within the groups.
           4.8.3.2.1. To sort data by groups:
              4.8.3.2.1.1. Open the table with the data you want to sort.
              4.8.3.2.1.2. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Sort or click the sort icon on
              the tool bar. Sort Table dialog box appears. It shows the sorting options currently
              selected for the table. If you do not want to sort by that data item, click its
              column handle and click Delete.
              4.8.3.2.1.3. Click the Add button and choose the data item from the drop-down
 226                                                   AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


             list that you want to use for sorting the data. The item is added to the column.
             4.8.3.2.1.4. To add a data item to be sorted within the Group, click the Add
             button again and add another data item. In the following example, the budget
             code (BC) is the group, and the routing identifier is the data item to be sorted with
             each BC.

Figure 4.87. Sort Dialog Box.




             4.8.3.2.1.5. Columns with Group Sort selected always precede those with no
             group sorting (Group="None") to assure that the sorting is done correctly on the
             table. If you move a column without group sorting above a column with group
             sorting, the column you're moving is automatically set to group sort. Similarly, if
             you move a column with group sorting below a column without group sorting, the
             column on top is automatically set to group sort.
             4.8.3.2.1.6. Select the Direction options for each column. The sort direction does
             not have to be the same for each column.
             4.8.3.2.1.7. From the drop-down list in the Group column select a group sorting
             option.
                 4.8.3.2.1.7.1. None--data in the column is not grouped and is all sorted as a
                 unit. Usually the last data item in a group sorting has the None option
                 selected.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                          227


                  4.8.3.2.1.7.2. Group Sort--data is sorted within each group. The group name
                  appears once at the beginning of the grouped data.
                  4.8.3.2.1.7.3. Page Break--data is sorted within each group. The group name
                  appears once at the beginning of each new page.
               4.8.3.2.1.8. Click OK. The data is sorted on the table.
       4.8.3.3. About the sort order. Order of the columns on the Sort dialog is important
       because it affects how you can compare the data quickly based on the sorting. The order
       of the columns determines which data is sorted first, second, third, and so on. You can
       move the columns up and down to put them in the order that you want on the dialog box.
       To move a column up or down on the list, click the column's Handle (just to the right of
       the column number) to select it. The pointer becomes an up/down arrow indicating you
       can move the selected column up or down in the order.
       4.8.3.4. Sorting Data on Cross Tabs. Because the location of data on a cross tab
       determines the relationship of one data item to another, sorting cross tab data is
       somewhat different from sorting tabular data. In particular, you normally want to
       maintain those data relationships while rearranging the data.
The way to maintain the data relationships is to sort data on the left axis relative to a specific
column on the top axis. Or, sort data on the top axis relative to a specific row on the left axis.
The Sort Cross tab dialog automatically sorts the data in that manner and maintains the data
relationships.
Note: Data on a cross tab layout is already sorted by default. Text items are automatically sorted
alphabetically from A-Z and numbers are sorted from lowest to highest, but you can reverse the
sort order.

       Number (Z-A order) within TRIC Code (A-Z order). Sorting cross tabs on the Sort Cross
       Tab dialog box. The Sort Cross Tab dialog offers a full range of options for sorting Cross
       Tab worksheets. To sort data on a cross tab:
          4.8.3.5.1. Open the cross tab with the data you want to sort.
          4.8.3.5.2. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Sort. The Sort Cross tab dialog
          appears.

          4.8.3.5.3. Select the location on the cross tab of the items you want to use to sort the
          data.
             4.8.3.5.3.1. Above the data--shows the data items on the top axis.
             4.8.3.5.3.2. Along left side of data--shows the data items on the left axis.
          4.8.3.5.4. Click the drop-down list of Item to sort and select the data item. The list
          includes the items for either the top axis or side axis depending on the selected sort
          location (above the data or along the left side).
          4.8.3.5.5. Click the Column/Row drop-down list and select the specific column or
          row in the cross tab to use for sorting.
             4.8.3.5.5.1. Column drop-down list identifies the column that contains the data
             for sorting when sorting is based on data from the left side of the cross tab.
             4.8.3.5.5.2. The Row drop-down list identifies the row that contains the data for
             sorting when sorting is based on data from the top of the cross tab.
          4.8.3.5.6. Click the Direction drop-down list and select the sort direction.
          4.8.3.5.7. If you want to change the sort order, select one of the data items and click
          Move Up or Move Down.

           4.8.3.5.8. Click OK. The data is sorted on the cross tab.
           4.8.3.5.9. Repeat the process to add other sorting to the data.
Note: After sorting a cross tab, the data on the top axis or left axis is reordered relative to the
column or row you used for sorting.
       4.8.3.6. Adding a data point. Adding a data point to a cross tab sorting enables you to
       sort the data in some other arrangement. Added data points must always be the first item
       for sorting. This is because sorting items by data points makes logical sense, but sorting
       data points by items does not.
       4.8.3.7. To illustrate this concept, it makes sense to sort the City item by the Profit data
       point because each City has a Profit amount associated with it. However, it does not
       make sense to sort Profit by City because each profit value has only one city associated
       with it. It would be like trying to sort the profit amounts by "New York" or "Phoenix,"
       which doesn't make logical sense.
You can add the data point two or more times. This is useful with duplicate data points. In the
example, if two cities had exactly the same amount of profit, you could specify how to sort those
two duplicated pieces of data (low to high or high to low). This type of "sorting within sorting"
on a cross tab is helpful for text or other data likely to have duplicate values. For financial data
or other variable numeric items, however, sorting within sorting is usually not necessary.
   4.8.4. Calculating Data. Calculations can play an important part when analyzing data.
   Discoverer has a full range of common mathematical functions and operators to calculate
   results on your worksheets. Discoverer displays the results of calculations as new columns
   on a worksheet, or the calculations can be part of other calculations.
Below is an example of a simple calculation.
       4.8.4.1. Example: Calculate the extended price of a requisition. This example uses the
       Item Table Unit Price item and multiplies it by the Due-In Table. Quantity Due-In to
       produce the Extended Price. The answer appears in a new column with a name you type
       on the New Calculation dialog. In this example, it is Extended Price.

      4.8.4.2. Figure 4.91. shows the results of applying the calculation. Not all calculations
      need to use Items or Functions as part of the calculation formula. You can type a formula
      directly into the Calculation box.

             created for the worksheet. Check marked calculations are active and apply to the
             worksheet.
             4.8.4.3.1.3. Click New or Edit. The New or Edit Calculation dialog appears.
             4.8.4.3.1.4. Type a name for the calculation in the box at the top of the dialog.
             This name appears on the worksheet as the column header of the calculation
             results column.
             4.8.4.3.1.5. Click the Show drop-down list to see the different expressions.
                4.8.4.3.1.5.1. Functions--Lists a wide range of mathematical functions that
                you can apply to the formula.
                4.8.4.3.1.5.2. Selected Items--Lists the items in the worksheet; this is helpful
                because you don't have to remember the name of an item in order to include it
                in a formula.
                4.8.4.3.1.5.3. Available Items--Lists all the items available for the worksheet
                even if the items are not currently used on the worksheet.
                4.8.4.3.1.5.4. Calculations--Lists the calculations defined for the worksheet in
                case you want to use an existing calculation as part of your new calculation.

              4.8.4.3.1.6. Click each part of the expression that you want to add to the
              calculation and click Paste. The item or function moves to the Calculation text
              box. You can also drag from the box on the left to the Calculation text box.
              4.8.4.3.1.7. Click the operator (for example, + or -) button to add mathematical
              operations to the Calculation text box.
              4.8.4.3.1.8. Continue to add items, functions, operators, and so forth until you
              complete your calculation expression.
              4.8.4.3.1.9. Click OK to save the expression. The Edit Worksheet dialog appears
              and displays the name of the calculation you just created or edited.
              4.8.4.3.1.10. To apply the calculation to your worksheet, make sure it has a
              checkmark in the box next to its name.
              4.8.4.3.1.11. Click OK.
   4.8.5. Totaling Numeric Data. When working with numeric information, you often need to
   see various summations of the data. Totals can sum rows and columns of numbers, find
   averages and standard deviation, compute subtotals and grand totals, and so on. When you
   add a Total to a worksheet, Discoverer automatically adds a column or row to the worksheet
   for the totals data.
In the example below, the Worksheet contains a sub-total for each DIFM Status Code and a
grand total for all DIFM items.

Figure 4.93. Example of Totaled Data.




       4.8.5.1. Displaying existing totals. You can define totals for a worksheet and then
       display them on the worksheet or not. To display totals or sub-totals on a table or cross
       tab:
          4.8.5.1.1. Open the worksheet to which you want to add a total.
AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013                                                             235


           4.8.5.1.2. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Totals. The Edit Worksheet dialog
           appears with the Totals tab selected. The list of totals shows all currently defined
           totals.

Figure 4.94. Edit Worksheet, Totals Tab.




           4.8.5.1.3. Click the box in front of the Total definition so that a checkmark appears.
           4.8.5.1.4. Click OK. Discoverer now computes the totals and displays them in the
           table or cross tab.
To remove totals from the data:
           4.8.5.1.5. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Totals. The Totals dialog appears.
           4.8.5.1.6. Click the checkmark box (es) to remove the checkmark.
           4.8.5.1.7. Click OK. Discoverer removes the totals from the table or cross tab.
       4.8.5.2. Creating a New Total. Creating a new totals definition has three steps:
           4.8.5.2.1. Select the totals to calculate.
           4.8.5.2.2. Select the type of total and where to place it in the table or cross tab.
           4.8.5.2.3. Create a label for the totals column or row.
           4.8.5.2.4. To create a new totals definition:
 236                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


               4.8.5.2.4.1. Open the worksheet to which you want to add a total definition.
               4.8.5.2.4.2. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Totals.          The Edit Sheet
               dialog appears with the Totals tab selected.
               4.8.5.2.4.3. Click the New button. The New Total dialog appears.

Figure 4.95. New Total Dialog Box.




               4.8.5.2.4.4. Click the data point drop-down list and select the data point to use for
               totaling data, for example, Due In From Maintenance Location.
You can also create totals for all the data points on the worksheet by selecting All Data Points
from the drop-down list.
               4.8.5.2.4.5. Click the drop-down list for the kind of total you want and select the
               calculation to use for totaling data. The options are:
                   4.8.5.2.4.5.1. Sum--Adds all the values.
                   4.8.5.2.4.5.2. Average--Adds all the values and divides by the number of
                   values.
                   4.8.5.2.4.5.3. Average Distinct--Adds all the unique values and divides by
                   that number of values. Duplicated values are not included. For example, if a
                   set of values includes 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, and 7, the calculation of the distinct
                   average is 3+4+5+6+7 divided by 5. The duplicate values of 3 and 5 are not
                   included.
                   4.8.5.2.4.5.4. Count--Counts the total number of values.
                   4.8.5.2.4.5.5. Count Distinct--Counts the number of unique values.
AFH23-123V2PT4    8 AUGUST 2013                                                           237


             4.8.5.2.4.5.6. Minimum--Finds the lowest value.
             4.8.5.2.4.5.7. Maximum--Finds the highest value.
             4.8.5.2.4.5.8. Standard Deviation--Calculates the standard             deviation.
             Standard deviation is the square root of the variance of the values.
             4.8.5.2.4.5.9. Standard Deviation Distinct--Calculates the standard deviation,
             but only using unique, unduplicated values.
             4.8.5.2.4.5.10. Sum Distinct--Adds the values, but only using unique,
             unduplicated values. For example, the sum distinct of 3, 3, 4, 5 is 3+4+5=12.
             The duplicate value of 3 is not included.
             4.8.5.2.4.5.11. Variance--Calculates the variance. Variance is the sum of the
             squares of the differences between each value and the arithmetic mean, all
             divided by the number of values.
             4.8.5.2.4.5.12. Variance Distinct--Calculates the variance, but only using
             unique, unduplicated values.
             4.8.5.2.4.5.13. Percentage of Grand--Calculates the Grand Total of the row or
             column, and then finds the percentage of the current column or row of the
             Grand Total.
             4.8.5.2.4.5.14. Percentage of Grand Distinct--Calculates the percentage of the
             Grand Total of the row or column, but only using unique, unduplicated values.
          4.8.5.2.4.6. Select where you want the total to be shown.
             4.8.5.2.4.6.1. Grand total at bottom--Calculates the Grand Total for a column
             and places it after the last row of the table or cross tab.
             4.8.5.2.4.6.2. Grand total on right (cross tab only)--Calculates the Grand
             Total for a row and displays it in a column on the right side of the cross tab.
             4.8.5.2.4.6.3. Subtotal at each change in--click the drop-down arrow to select
             the data item to use for the totals. For example, if you sort the data by DIFM
             Status Code, and want to see number of details by DIFM Status Code, select
             DIFM Status Code as the data item. Then, Discoverer automatically displays
             the total count for each status code on a separate line.
             4.8.5.2.4.6.4. All Group Sorted Items--displays totals for items set to be
             group sorted. For example, if the table contains two columns of numeric data
             set to be group sorted, subtotals are displayed for both columns. Inappropriate
             data points for the type of total are not displayed.
             4.8.5.2.4.6.5. For example, Region is a set of data points but summing Region
             by its data points doesn't make sense--it would be like trying to add "Central"
             to "East". In this case, Regions are not summed even if it is a group-sorted
             item.
             4.8.5.2.4.6.6. A specific numeric data point (such as Price, in the example)--
             displays totals for the selected set of data points.
 238                                                      AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


                  4.8.5.2.4.6.7. A non-numeric data point (such as DIFM Status Code, in the
                  example)--when you select a non-numeric set of data points, the options for
                  the totals in the first drop-down list are limited to only those options that apply
                  to non-numeric data points. For example, if you select DIFM Status Code,
                  sum of a status code does not make sense. The only totals that make sense for
                  non-numeric data points are Count, Count Distinct, Maximum, and Minimum.
                  4.8.5.2.4.6.8. Don't display subtotal for a single row--If the group of data
                  consists of a single row, do not display a subtotal for it (the row's data value
                  and subtotal are the same).
              4.8.5.2.4.7. Click one of the options for the current page or all the pages of the
              worksheet.
              4.8.5.2.4.8. Click the option to generate the label automatically if you want
              Discoverer to generate a label based on the data items being totaled.
              4.8.5.2.4.9. You can click the drop-down list for labels and choose additional
              options for the title from it. The options from the drop-down list produce labels
              that can change as the data changes by adding text codes (such as "&Item" and
              "&Value") to the label. In the actual labels in the table or cross tab, the
              ampersand (&) will not appear, and appropriate names from the table or cross tab
              will be inserted in place of the words "Item" or "Value."
              4.8.5.2.4.10. This table shows some examples.

Table 4.4. Examples.
                 Option               Example                  Sample Label

                  4.8.5.2.4.10.1. If the total calculates for all data points (as selected at the top
                  of the dialog), the labels can appear for each appropriate name. For example,
                  when totaling two items, and you select Insert Item Name (&Name), labels for
                  both item names appear in the data or cross tab.

   4.8.6. Finding Percentages. Calculating percentages of numbers is a typical data analysis
   task. Using the Percentages feature, you specify the data to use to calculate a percentage as
   well as the value to use to represent the percentage (Grand Total, Subtotal, and so on).
Notes:
1. Due to rounding of data, percentages might not add exactly to 100.
2. In the following example, Line Item Percent shows the percentage of line items at each base
(SRAN) for each SRAN as a percentage of total line items in the Air Force inventory.

4.9. Sharing Results With Others. You can share results with others by printing your
worksheets and graphs, exporting data to another format (such as an Excel spreadsheet), or
specifically sharing workbooks with other people who also have access to Oracle Reports
database.
   4.9.1. Printing Worksheets and Graphs. Discoverer provides the Print Wizard to help you
   print your worksheets and graphs. With the help of the Print Wizard, what you see on screen
   prints out the same way on paper, including worksheet titles, graph titles and legends, and
   page items. You can print a single worksheet, all worksheets in a workbook, and all graphs
   associated with any worksheet. Worksheets and their graphs print sequentially so that each
   graph prints in order immediately after its worksheet.
       4.9.1.1. If your worksheet contains Page Items, note that you can print exactly what you
       see on screen. To print other combinations of Page Items, first pivot the Page Items; then
       print your modified worksheet. Also note that pivoting Page Items changes the content
       of your graph. Before printing, verify that your graph contains the data that you want to
       print.
Graphs always print on a single sheet of paper. However, within the boundaries of that sheet of
paper you can choose to print the graph at different sizes. You can print the graph the same size
that you see on screen or scale the graph to fill the entire sheet of paper or any smaller size. If
what you see on screen is too large to fit onto a single sheet of paper, the Print Wizard
automatically scales the graph to the correct size.

       4.9.1.2. To print worksheets and their graphs:
          4.9.1.2.1. Open the worksheet that you want to print. Make sure it contains the
          combination of Page Items that you want. Open the worksheet that you want to print.
          Make sure it contains the combination of Page Items that you want.

       4.9.1.2.4. Select whether you want to print the graph and its worksheet, only the
       worksheet, or only the graph. Click Next. If you choose to print only the worksheet,
       without any graphs, the Print Wizard takes you to the final dialog. Otherwise, the second
       Print Wizard dialog appears.

      4.9.1.2.5. Select the size that you want to print your graph:
          4.9.1.2.5.1. Preserve the ratio of height and width--If what you see on screen is larger
          than a piece of paper, this checkbox scales the graph smaller without distorting the
          graph.
          4.9.1.2.5.2. Preserve the actual font size--If the graph must be scaled to fit a piece of
          paper, this checkbox prevents the fonts from also becoming smaller.
          4.9.1.2.5.3. Select the other graph elements that you want to print:
          4.9.1.2.5.4. Print worksheet title with the graph--A graph and its worksheet can have
          different titles. This checkbox prints the worksheet's title onto the paper.
          4.9.1.2.5.5. Print page item values with the graph--If your worksheet contains Page
          Items, this checkbox prints the Page Item values onto the paper; for example, "SRAN
          = 2823."
      4.9.1.2.6. Click Next.
      4.9.1.2.7. If you have defined parameters for the worksheet, the optional Print Parameter
      Page allows you to restrict your printout to certain Items. For example, if a parameter is
      created on SRAN, this page may ask you to enter a SRAN or choose from a list of
      SRANs, e.g. 2804, 2823, or 3300. If you do not want to restrict your printout, close the
      Print Wizard, choose Tools\Parameters, and turn off any parameters by de-selecting the
      Parameter check boxes.

4.10. Using Lists of Values (LOVs). This section describes how to improve productivity using
Lists of Values (LOVs) in Discoverer.
   4.10.1. What are LOVs? LOVs contain a list of valid values for an item. For example, a
   LOV for a type account code item might contain the values, B and E (see figure below).
 256                                                   AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.112. Example of LOV.




       4.10.1.1. LOVs are used in Parameters, Conditions, Discoverer Item Navigator, and
       Export Wizard.
       4.10.1.2. LOVs are used in the following way:
          4.10.1.2.1. When used in parameters, conditions, and export, LOVs enable you to
          select predefined values rather than enter arbitrary values in a text field.
          4.10.1.2.2. When used in the Discoverer item navigator, LOVs enable you to apply
          conditions to worksheets without defining conditions criteria. For example, choosing
          type account code “B” from a LOV in the Discoverer Item Navigator filters a
          worksheet to display only data for Type Account Code “B.”
          4.10.1.2.3. LOVs work differently with parameters and conditions:
              4.10.1.2.3.1. With parameters, creator of the Discoverer workbook specifies
              whether single or multiple values are allowed. For example, when setting a
              parameter, a user might choose 1999 and 2000 from a LOV.
              4.10.1.2.3.2. With conditions, the condition type determines whether you can
              select single or multiple values.
   4.10.2. LOV Examples. This sub-section contains examples of using LOVs.
       4.10.2.1. A LOV used to specify worksheet parameters. In the figure below, a LOV has
       been created on the Air Force Recoverable Assembly Management Process System
       Report Code (AFRAMPS) item, containing the AFRAMPS Codes ‘blank, 5, 6, & 7. If a
       LOV was not defined on AFRAMPS Code, you might enter '8' here, which would result
       in an empty worksheet because the database does not contain this AFRAMPS Code. The
       figure below shows the value ‘5’ being selected from a LOV in a parameter dialog.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                      257


Figure 4.113. Edit Parameters Values Dialog Box.




      4.10.2.2. A LOV used in a condition. LOVs are also used when you create conditions.
      For example, in the figure below, the LOV containing months is used to choose values
      against which to match worksheet data. The figure below shows the value Feb (i.e.
      February) being selected from a LOV in a condition dialog

Figure 4.114. Using LOVs in a Condition Statement.




      4.10.2.3. A LOV used in the Discoverer Item Navigator. LOVs are also used in the
      Discoverer item navigator. For example, in the figure below, the LOV values for EEX of
      2 & 5 are selected for display on a worksheet. In other words, the LOV values are used
      to filter the worksheet. The figure below shows the values 2 & 5 being selected in the
      Discoverer item navigator.

Figure 4.115. Using LOVs in Item Navigator.




   4.10.3. About using long LOVs. When LOVs contain a large number of values, Discoverer
   displays a dialog that enables you to search LOV values and select the values that you want.
   For example, if a LOV contains hundreds of values, you can select only values that begin
   with the letter 'A', or select only values that contain 'CPM'.
       4.10.3.1. When using long LOVs, the following rules apply:
          4.10.3.1.1. When LOVs are used with parameters, you can use the Select Multiple
          Values option to display a dialog that enables you to search and select LOV values.
          4.10.3.1.2. When LOVs are used with conditions, you can use the Select values
          option to display a dialog that enables you to search and select LOV values.
   4.10.4. How to select single values from long LOVs. When LOVs contain a large number of
   values, you select single LOV values using the “Select Value” dialog
       4.10.4.1. To select single values from long LOVs, display the “Select Value” dialog.
          4.10.4.1.1. From the “Edit Parameter” dialog or “New Parameter” dialog, click the
          down arrow next to the What default value do you want to give this parameter? field,
          then choose Select values.
          4.10.4.1.2. From the “Edit Condition” dialog, or “New Condition” dialog choose
          Select values from the Values drop down list.

           value from the Displayed values list.
           4.10.4.1.4. If you cannot see the value that you want in the Displayed values list, do
           one of the following:
                4.10.4.1.4.1. Use the scroll bar to navigate up and down the values in the current
                group.
                4.10.4.1.4.2. Use the Next and Previous buttons to display the next or previous
                group of values in the LOV (more than 100).
           4.10.4.1.5. Limit the values in the Displayed values list using the Search by and
           Search for fields, as follows:
                4.10.4.1.5.1. Use the Search by drop down list to specify how you want to match
                LOV values.
For example, Starts with or Equals.
                4.10.4.1.5.2. Enter a search term in the Search for field.
                4.10.4.1.5.3. For example, if you choose 'Starts with', type A to find LOV values
                that begins with A.

4.11. Changing Default Settings. Discoverer's default Graphical User Interface settings
determine how Discoverer works, looks, and feels. Using the Discoverer Options dialog, you
can change the default options to suit your preferences and requirements.
Default options apply when you start working with Discoverer. Changes to defaults do not affect
previous work. For example, if you use the Options dialog to change the formats for new
worksheets, the formatting on previous worksheets is not affected.
Note: In addition to opening the Options dialog from the menus, you can also open it by clicking
the Options button if available in other dialogs. In that case, the options may apply only to the
features offered in that dialog.
   4.11.1. To change default settings:
       4.11.1.1. Choose Tools, and then Options. The Options dialog appears. The tabs across
       the top of the dialog list the different option categories.
       4.11.1.2. Click a tab to see its options.
   4.11.2. Setting General Options. General options are for opening workbooks and displaying
   wizard graphics.
       4.11.2.1. To set general options:
           4.11.2.1.1. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Options. The Options dialog
           appears. The tabs across the top of the dialog list the different option categories.

          4.11.2.1.3. Select the defaults for opening a workbook and running a query to load
          the data.
             4.11.2.1.3.1. Run query automatically. Discoverer automatically retrieves the
             data specified by the worksheet in the workbook. Select this option to retrieve
             data for the worksheet as soon as you open a workbook or click on the tab of a
             worksheet.
             4.11.2.1.3.2. Don't run query (leave sheet empty). Opens the workbook and
             worksheet, but does not retrieve any data from the database. That is, the
             worksheet opens but does not contain any data. A typical reason for selecting this
             option is to see a different worksheet than the one that opens by default without
             waiting for the query results.
             4.11.2.1.3.3. Ask for confirmation. This is the default selection. After the
             workbook opens, a dialog asks if you want to run the query for the first
             worksheet.
             4.11.2.1.3.4. Show wizard graphics. Several Discoverer dialogs include artistic
             graphics (bitmaps). Deselect this option if you don't want to see the graphics in
             the dialogs.

   4.11.3. Setting Query Governor Options. Query Governor options help reduce the amount
   of time it takes to display data. You can set defaults for Summary Data and for Queries.
Using Summary Data loads data more quickly for the work, you do most often. When you
request data for a worksheet, Discoverer first checks Summary Tables set up by the Discoverer
Administrator to see if their saved data satisfies your request and, if it does, loads the appropriate
data quickly. If the Summary Tables' data does not satisfy your request, Discoverer then
redirects the request to the detail data.
Notes:
1. Do not use Summary Tables if you normally work with the most current data in the database.
The saved data in the Summary Tables remains constant until updated with new data. Summary
Tables should be updated periodically to incorporate new data.
Query Governor options help you set limits on the amount of time a query should take to
complete. Use these options to limit the time you wait for Discoverer to run a query. The
options set time and size limits on data as it is being retrieved from the database.
2. Discoverer Administrator at AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity determines the
upper limits for the Query Governor options. For example, AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity may determine that queries cannot run longer than 30 minutes. If you set
the limit for 60 minutes, the numbers will change back to 30 automatically.
       4.11.3.1. To set query governor options:
           4.11.3.1.1. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Options. The Options dialog
           appears. The tabs across the top of the dialog list the different option categories.

             4.11.3.1.3.1. Always, when available. Select this option if time-sensitive data is
             not important to data analysis. Discoverer retrieves and displays saved data from
             the Summary Tables regardless of whether the data is current.
             4.11.3.1.3.2. When summary data is more recent than. Select this option when
             time-sensitive data is necessary for worksheets. Click the up and down arrows to
             specify the number of days from the last data update. For example, if you're
             analyzing monthly data using Summary Tables, you want to make sure the data is
             less than thirty days old. If the Summary Tables' data has not been updated
             within the specified time, Discoverer does not use the Summary Tables to fulfill
             your query request. Instead Discoverer redirects your query request to the detail
             data and uses the latest data for the worksheet.
         4.11.3.1.4. Select the options for Query Governor Data.
             4.11.3.1.4.1. Warn me if predicted query time exceeds. When requesting data for
             a worksheet, Discoverer estimates the time required to complete the query. Select
             this option if you want a message to warn that the query will take a long time to
             complete. The message appears only if the estimated completion time exceeds
             the period you specify, in MM:SS format, for this option.

               4.11.3.1.4.2. Prevent queries from running longer than. Select this option to limit
               the time a query runs before it is cancelled. A warning message informs you if
               the query exceeds the set time, then Discoverer cancels the query. Normally, this
               option is selected if server performance is an issue because long running queries
               might affect server performance.
               4.11.3.1.4.3. Limit retrieved query data to. This option sets the maximum
               number of rows to retrieve for a query. If the query returns more rows than the
               value you set here, a message informs you that not all data is retrieved and,
               consequently, the displayed data might not be complete.
               4.11.3.1.4.4. Retrieve data incrementally in groups. Set this option when the
               database contains large tables with many rows that might take a long time to
               retrieve. With this option selected, Discoverer retrieves rows of data in
               increments rather than all at the same time. The initial retrieval is faster if the
               number of rows to retrieve is smaller. The default size of the data group is 250
               rows, which equates to the first 10 pages of data at 25 rows per page. You can set
               the number of rows per page using the Rows per Page option on the Sheet Format
               tab.
               4.11.3.1.4.5. Cancel list-of-values retrieval after.       Some dialogs have a
               convenient drop-down list from which you can select a value for an option instead
               of manually typing the value. This is called a list of values. For example, when
               creating a condition for analyzing inventories data by budget code (BC), you
               could either choose the value “8” from a list of budget codes or manually type the
               BC "8" as part of the condition statement. However, some large lists of values
               take a long time to retrieve from the database, such as a list of 20,000 part
               numbers. If you don't want to wait for Discoverer to retrieve these larger lists of
               values, click the up and down arrows to set the maximum amount of time you
               would wait for this list to appear. This option does not cancel Discoverer's
               retrieval of the actual data for a query. In the case of the part numbers, for
               example, all the data about the parts in stock, price per part, demand data and so
               on, is displayed in the appropriate tables. Only the drop-down list of part
               numbers in various dialogs would not be available.
           4.11.3.1.5. Click OK.
   4.11.4. Setting Sheet Format Options. This tab in the Options dialog is for setting the
   display format of the table or cross tab.
Note: Changes to these settings affect the current sheet as well as any new sheets created later.
       4.11.4.1. To set sheet format options:
           4.11.4.1.1. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Options. The Options dialog
           appears.

           4.11.4.1.3. Select the options for the table or cross tab.
           4.11.4.1.4. Title. Displays a title if one was created earlier.
               4.11.4.1.4.1. Horizontal and Vertical Gridlines. Lines that separate rows and
               columns. The display example on the dialog shows a representation of your
               choices.
               4.11.4.1.4.2. Null values as. A cell that contains a null value does not contain
               any data. Select the text to use to designate a null value from the drop-down list
               or type a value in the box.
Note: If you select the 0 (zero) symbol as the null value, it may appear to the person looking at
the table or cross tab that zero is the actual data. For example, in a cell specifying requisition
exception code (REX), zero means REX code is ‘0,’ whereas a null value in the same cell means
the item table does not contain a REX code. Therefore, using the zero symbol to indicate null
values might be misleading to others unless you explicitly state that 0 is equivalent to no data.
               4.11.4.1.4.3. Values that cannot be aggregated as. Numbers that cannot be
               aggregated are formatted as one of the values in the pull down list.
               4.11.4.1.4.4. Row Numbers (Table only). Sequential numbers of each row in the
               table, shown on the left side of the table.

              4.11.4.1.4.5. Inline/Outline (Cross tabs only). Arrangement of the side-axis data
              items. As you select one of the options, the example icon represents the
              arrangement.
              4.11.4.1.4.6. Rows per screen page. The number of data rows on each page of
              the worksheet. Click the up and down arrow buttons to select the number. Click
              OK.
   4.11.5. Setting Default Format Options. Default Format options are for setting the font style,
   text color, and background color of a worksheet's data, column headings, and totals. To set
   format options:
       4.11.5.1. From the menu, choose Tools, and then Options. The Options dialog appears.

      4.11.5.2. Resetting default formats. Sometimes, after changing several aspects of a
      format you want to change it back to the original Discoverer default settings. Instead of
      changing each format setting individually, you can click the Reset button.
          4.11.5.2.1. In the Format Options dialog, select the default format to reset. Resetting
          applies only to the selected format. Thus, you can reset one format but keep your
          changes made to the others. Click OK.
   4.11.6. Setting Advanced Options. Advanced options are for turning on/off automatic
   querying and for catching join errors that relate to database relationships.

Figure 4.123. Options Dialog Box, Advanced Tab.




          4.11.6.1.3. Select the options.
              4.11.6.1.3.1. Automatic Querying. When you make a change to a worksheet that
              affects the data results (as opposed to formatting changes), Discoverer
              automatically re-queries the database to display the appropriate results based on
              your changes. However, you can use this option to disable the automatic query
              feature in case you want to make changes to the worksheet but not have
              Discoverer update the data.
              4.11.6.1.3.2. Fan-Trap Detection. When this check box is NOT selected,
              Discoverer automatically detects and resolves fan trap and chasm trap queries into
              multiple SQL statements to obtain normal expected results. If you disable Fan
              Trap detection, this may result in these queries generating Cartesian products,
              with potentially misleading results. Select this check box if you want to prevent
              Discoverer from checking for fan traps.
              4.11.6.1.3.3. Multiple Join Detection. Check this option to turn off Discoverer's
              automatic detection and prevention of worksheet arrangements that have potential
              multiple join paths.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                          271


         4.11.6.1.4. Click OK.
      4.11.6.2. About automatic querying. While working with a worksheet, you can make
      changes that affect the data being displayed. For example, if you add a new data item or
      change a calculation that produces a data column, the displayed data may not reflect the
      change until Discoverer re-queries the database. With automatic querying, Discoverer
      automatically re-queries the database to get the updated data to display. In some cases,
      however, you may not want Discoverer to automatically re-query the database. For
      example, if you intend to make several changes that affect the data, then you don't want
      Discoverer to re-query the database until you're finished with the changes. Using the
      Advanced Options dialog, you can turn on and off the automatic re-querying feature. If it
      is turned off and you want Discoverer to re-query the database, choose Sheet, and then
      Refresh Sheet from the menu.
      4.11.6.3. About Fan Traps. A fan-trap occurs when the data items in two folders are not
      directly related (such as items in the Adjusted Level Detail folder and the Supply Point
      Detail folder), but do have a relationship based on the data items in a third folder
      (through the Item Table folder) see Figure 4.124. As you're creating a new worksheet,
      Discoverer automatically detects fan trap situations, unless the Disable fan-trap Detection
      option is deselected in the Options dialog. If the option is not selected, Discoverer will
      prevent queries from being built with a fan trap condition. An Error Notice (Figure
      4.125) will be given.

Figure 4.124. Example of Fan Trap.
 272                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.125. Fan Trap Error Notice.




Note: If the Disable Fan Trap Detection option is selected, the query could return ambiguous
results based on the relationships or non-relationships between tables.
       4.11.6.4. About Multiple Join Paths. When you create new worksheets, the data items in
       the worksheets are often stored in multiple folders in the database. Discoverer checks to
       make sure that these multiple folders have a clear, unambiguous relationship between
       them, and therefore, that the relationships among the data items is also clear and
       unambiguous. For example, suppose a database contains two folders--one for information
       about sales orders and another for information about customers. Both folders contain the
       data item "Customer ID" because each sales order is for a customer specified by the
       Customer ID, and an ID number identifies each customer in the Customer folder. In this
       case, if you run a query about sales order details and also want to see customer details,
       such as first and last name, Discoverer can clearly determine which customers are
       associated with each sale by relating the Customer ID to the sales details and customer
       details.
           4.11.6.4.1. However, some databases organize information so the relationship
           between items in different folders is ambiguous. This means that data items can be
           associated with each other in multiple ways, which is a situation known as a "multiple
           join path." As you are creating new worksheets, Discoverer can automatically detect
           and warn you if the potential for multiple join paths exist because, if it does,
           Discoverer might associate the items in a way you did not expect or intend. Thus,
           when you query the database, the results might not be what you intend either.
The warning that a multiple join path situation exists is not an error message; the warning merely
advises you that the database contains relationships among data items that you might not know
exist. If Discoverer detects and warns you of a multiple join path situation, please contact your
Discoverer Administrator who can determine if the database's organization needs to be modified.
           4.11.6.4.2. Discoverer automatically detects multiple join paths only if the Disable
           Multiple Join Path Detection option is deselected on the Options dialog. If that
           option is not selected, Discoverer builds your new worksheets without checking for or
           warning you about multiple join paths.
       4.11.6.5. Using SQL. If you are familiar with SQL, you can analyze the SQL statements
       that Discoverer executes against the database.
AFH23-123V2PT4      8 AUGUST 2013                                                      273


         4.11.6.5.1. Looking at the SQL Statements for Worksheets.

                4.11.6.5.1.1.1. Choose Sheet, and then Show SQL. The SQL Inspector dialog
                box appears. It shows the SQL statements used to create your current
                worksheet.

                4.11.6.5.1.1.2. Click Copy to copy the statements and paste them to another
                SQL program. The SQL statements Discoverer uses to open a workbook or
                worksheet involve complex programming. Therefore, you cannot simply copy
                a worksheet's SQL and use it to open another workbook or worksheet.

                  4.11.6.5.2.1.4. Using the Discoverer Execution Plan. Plan tab displays the
                  Execution Plan chosen by the Oracle Server for the query request. The
                  Execution Plan defines the sequence of operations that the Oracle Server
                  performs to execute the SQL statement. You can look at an Execution Plan to
                  see how a SQL statement is being executed. For example, when using
                  Summaries, you may wish to check that a query is using a Summary or
                  Materialized View created by your Discoverer Administrator.
4.12. BCE Due-Out Status Listing (D03/M09).
   4.12.1. Purpose. To provide a listing for base civil engineering (BCE) personnel to assist in
   the review and validation of work order requirements. This listing also allows BCE
   personnel to ensure that requisitioning and follow-up actions are done quickly, provides the
   opportunity to analyze supply status to determine if satisfactory actions are being taken by
   the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS)/Materiel Management Activity and AFMC SCM-R
   Stock Control Activity, and to begin timely cancellation actions if the materiel due-out is no
   longer required.
   4.12.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_BCE_DUE_OUT table
   and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters are
   described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was compiled
   using the following criteria:
       4.12.2.1. The primary tables used to build the enterprise table are the DUE_OUT_DTL,
       DUE_IN_DTL,                                            STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL,
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                             275


       STATUS_LOCAL_PURCHASE_DTL, STATUS_SHIP_DTL and ITEM_TABLE.
       Secondary    tables      include     the      ORG_COST_CENTER,
       ISG_STOCK_NBR_RELATIONSHIP,                 ROUTING_IDENTIFIER,
       BASE_CONSTANTS_1, SPECIAL_CONTROL, and SRAN_REF_TABLE.
       4.12.2.2. Due-out detail records must be for BCE accounts (Force Activity Designator
       (FAD) code equal to (‘J’, ‘K’, ‘L’, ‘M’, ‘N’)) and have activity code equal to (‘X’, ‘R’,
       ‘P’, ‘K’, ‘E’).
       4.12.2.3. For each due-out selected, the program looks for a corresponding due-in and
       status detail. If no due-in is found the due-out is assigned to Part ‘A’ (no due-in) and
       stock replenishment due-in/status information (if it exists) is retrieved. The heading
       ‘RDD/EDD’ on the listing will display the due-in cancellation code (if it exists).
       4.12.2.4. For due-outs with a due-in but no status detail, the program compares the
       current date against the requisition date. If the requisition date is greater than the current
       date the due-out is assigned to Part ‘C’ (satisfactory). Otherwise, the days difference is
       computed (current date – requisition date) and the due-out is assigned to Part ‘B’
       (unsatisfactory) or Part ‘C’ (satisfactory) based on priority group standards (discussed in
       more detail in Special Instructions, Para. 4.12.7.2).
       4.12.2.5. For due-outs with a due-in and status detail, the program compares the current
       date against the estimated ship date (STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL), estimated
       delivery date (STATUS_LOCAL_PURCHASE_DTL), or estimated date shipped
       (STATUS_SHIP_DTL) and the days difference is compared against established order
       and shipping time (O&ST) standard. The due-out is assigned to Part ‘B’ (unsatisfactory)
       or Part ‘C’ (satisfactory) based on still meeting the O&ST standard (discussed in more
       detail in Special Instructions, Para. 4.12.7.3).
       4.12.2.6. Additional business rules for determining what part the due-out should be
       assigned to are as follows:

       4.12.5.1. Mandatory:
           4.12.5.1.1. SRAN. The query must have at least one SRAN entry. This field will be
           edited as a four-digit alpha-numeric character string. Multiple SRANs (if used) must
           be separated by commas.

              4.12.5.2.1.1. ‘A’. Due-outs that do not have a due-in.
              4.12.5.2.1.2. ‘B’. Due-outs considered having unsatisfactory status due to
              exceeding established standards for due-ins with no status or due-ins with status
              where the estimated ship date, estimated delivery date, or estimated date shipped

             has exceeded the established O&ST standard.
             4.12.5.2.1.3. ‘C’. Due-outs considered having satisfactory status.
         4.12.5.2.2. ORG CODE(s). The user may input one or many organization codes
         (ORG). If this field is left blank it will select all. Multiple ORGs (if used) must be
         separated by commas.
         4.12.5.2.3. Urgency Of Need Designator (UNDs). The user may input one or many
         UND codes ranging from A - C. If this field is left blank it will select all.
  4.12.6. Data File Formats. None.
  4.12.7. Special Instructions.
     4.12.7.1. The tabs in this report required a non-traditional design. A "Crosstab" design
     was implemented where the groupings/headings were derived and formatted in such a
     way to render the report data similar to that of the legacy report. Crosstab data does not
     necessarily exist. A constant value of ‘1’ was used to provide the required crosstab
     value, but the report data is actually rendered in the crosstab headings. Subsequently, the
     data is not returned in table format.
     4.12.7.2. This Discoverer report uses business rules to determine if due-in detail records
     without status details meet established timelines before populating the enterprise table.
     As a result, due-outs are assigned to priority groups (PG) 1-3 based on the UND of the
     due-out and the FAD code of the organization (unless a FAD override was used on the
     due-out). PG 1 is assigned to UND ‘A’ and FAD 1-3, PG 2 is assigned to UND ‘A’ and
     FAD 4-5 or UND ‘B’ and FAD 1-3, and PG 3 is assigned to all others. The standard is 3
     days for PG ‘1’ and 9 days for PG ‘2’ and ‘3’.
     4.12.7.3. This Discoverer report uses business rules to determine if status detail records
     meet established O&ST standards before populating the enterprise table. As a result, the
     PG designation (identified in Para. 4.12.7.2) was assigned a second character based on
     the BASE_CONSTANTS_1 table identifying a unit as a CONUS (‘C’ character) or
     Overseas (‘O’ character) account. O&ST standards for the two-position designation are
     as follows:
         4.12.7.3.1. ‘1C’ = 8 days
         4.12.7.3.2. ‘2C’ = 12 days
         4.12.7.3.3. ‘3C’ = 31 days
         4.12.7.3.4. ‘1O’ = 13 days
         4.12.7.3.5. ‘2O’ = 17 days
         4.12.7.3.6. ‘3O’ = 84 days
     4.12.7.4. This Discoverer report will not provide status details for budget code ‘Z’ due-
     outs. The legacy 212 (STATUS-BCZ-INVEST-UOO-DETAIL) records did not migrate
     to the AFSCDB. Therefore, those details (as applicable) are not available in this report.
     However, this should have minimum impact to the user. During testing there was only
     one budget code ‘Z’ due-out in the entire AFSCDB that met the criteria for this report.
 278                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4           8 AUGUST 2013


       As a workaround, we substituted a generic phrase to query the SBSS for the most current
       status on these items.
       4.12.7.5. The data file download option (that is available in the legacy report) cannot be
       accomplished due to the format of the enterprise table. Data that appears in the legacy
       report as three lines (e.g. due-out, due-in, and status information) is now reflected on a
       single line. However, each tab can be downloaded to give a reasonable replacement for
       the download file. The “cleanest” download seems to come from the text file output
       versus the ‘.pdf’ format. Whether ‘.pdf’ or text, the output is tab-delimited and will need
       a clean-up routine developed.
       4.12.7.6. The legacy M09 program contained a dynamic cover letter. However, that is
       beyond the capability of Discoverer. As a workaround, a generic cover letter is included.
       If the user double-clicks in the text window, they can alter it to fit their needs before they
       export the letter.
4.13. Priority Monitor Report (D18).
   4.13.1. Purpose. To provide a listing for review of current priority due-out requirements that
   contains UND ‘A’ and ‘B’.
   4.13.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_PRIORITY_MONITOR
   table and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters
   are described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was
   compiled using the following criteria:
       4.13.2.1. The primary tables used to build the enterprise table are the DUE_OUT_DTL,
       DUE_IN_DTL,                                            STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL,
       STATUS_LOCAL_PURCHASE_DTL, STATUS_SHIP_DTL and ITEM_TABLE.
       Secondary     tables   include    the    PART_NBR_DTL,           ORG_COST_CENTER,
       ISG_STOCK_NBR_RELATIONSHIP,                                    ROUTING_IDENTIFIER,
       SPECIAL_CONTROL, and SRAN_REF_TABLE.
       4.13.2.2. Due-out detail records that are excluded from this report are:
          4.13.2.2.1. Base Civil Engineer (FAD code equal to ‘J’, ‘K’, ‘L’, ‘M’, or ‘N’).
          4.13.2.2.2. Awaiting Parts (Urgency Justification Code (UJC) equal to ‘AR’ or
          ‘BR’).
          4.13.2.2.3. Routine due-outs (UND <> ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘/’, ‘J’ or ‘1’).
          4.13.2.2.4. Due-outs with activity code equal to ‘F’.
       4.13.2.3. Unlinked due-ins will be furnished for all due-outs without due-ins, as well as
       due-outs where the due-out quantity is greater than the due-in quantity (if they exist).
       Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG) data will be fully considered for this portion,
       meaning unlinked due-ins for other stock numbers can be supplied if they are in the same
       ISG. The phrase ‘STK REPLENISH’ will appear under the heading ‘D/I MARKED
       FOR’ for all due-in records that meet these types of conditions.
       4.13.2.4. The phrase ‘NO DUE-IN’ will appear under the heading ‘REQN NBR’ when
       the due-out detail is not linked to a due-in.

   4.13.7. Special Instructions.
        4.13.7.1. The tabs in this report required a non-traditional design. A "Crosstab" design
        was implemented where the groupings/headings were derived and formatted in such a
        way to render the report data similar to that of the legacy report. Crosstab data does not
        necessarily exist. A constant value of ‘1’ was used to provide the required crosstab
        value, but the report data is actually rendered in the crosstab headings. Subsequently, the
        data is not returned in table format.
        4.13.7.2. This Discoverer report uses business rules that closely mirror the legacy
        software but there are slight differences. The legacy report uses the 108-record to
        determine serial number records for Part 5. However, that record was never migrated to
        the AFSCDB. Additionally, testing showed the legacy 108-record didn’t always contain
        the correct information. Therefore, the Discoverer Part 5 report will contain slightly
        different results than the legacy report.
        4.13.7.3. This Discoverer report will not provide status details for budget code ‘Z’ due-
        outs. The legacy 209 (STATUS-BNR-DETAIL) and 212 (STATUS-BCZ-INVEST-
        UOO-DETAIL) records did not migrate to the AFSCDB. Therefore, those details (as
        applicable) are not available in this report. However, this should have minimum impact
        to the user. During testing there were no due-outs in the entire AFSCDB that met the
        criteria for this report.
        4.13.7.4. This Discoverer report lists everything in document number sequence.
        However, the legacy report listed associated due-in/status details after the linked due-
        in/status details. Therefore, the same data exists but not in the same sequence as the
        legacy report.
        4.13.7.5. The data file download option (that is available in the legacy report) cannot be
        accomplished due to the format of the enterprise table. However, the cross-tabular report
        can be downloaded and the tabs removed to give a reasonable replacement for the
        download file. The “cleanest” download seems to come from the text file output versus
        the ‘.pdf’ format. Whether ‘.pdf’ or text, the output is tab-delimited and will need a
        clean-up routine developed to remove tabs and the crosstab value (‘1’).
        4.13.7.6. The DIT file (Tab 12) that is created needs to be verified and then processed.
        The legacy system previously sent this file automatically to the routine pseudo reader for
        processing. Therefore, this may require coordination with a computer operations
        database manager to complete the required action.
4.14. AWP Validation Listing (D19).
   4.14.1. Purpose. To provide a listing of awaiting parts (AWP) due-out detail records with
   applicable due-in and status details for AWP end items. It will also provide financial data to
   allow maintenance managers to consider the economic impact of repairing versus replacing
   the end item.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                        283


  4.14.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_AWP_VALIDATION
  table and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters
  are described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was
  compiled using the following criteria:
     4.14.2.1. The primary tables used to build the enterprise table are the DUE_OUT_DTL,
     DUE_IN_DTL,                                            STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL,
     STATUS_LOCAL_PURCHASE_DTL,                                         STATUS_SHIP_DTL,
     DUE_IN_FROM_MAINTENANCE_DTL, and ITEM_TABLE.                            Secondary tables
     include    the     COST_TABLE,          PART_NBR_DTL,            MICAP_AWP_TABLE,
     BASE_CONSTANTS_1, SPECIAL_CONTROL, and SRAN_REF_VW.
     4.14.2.2. The ENTERPRISE_AWP_VALIDATION table data is derived from 16
     separate queries and then combined. A unique sort key was built to sort the data into the
     proper order and display the records accordingly. A portion of the sort key uses a
     combination of a number and an alpha character to denote a particular “record type”. The
     record (RCD) types are defined as follows:
         4.14.2.2.1. RCD 1A – due-out data.
         4.14.2.2.2. RCD 1B – due in from maintenance (DIFM) data.
         4.14.2.2.3. RCD 1C – spacer.
         4.14.2.2.4. RCD 2A – due-in data (if it exists).
         4.14.2.2.5. RCD 3A – status FLP MILSTRIP data (if it exists).
         4.14.2.2.6. RCD 3B – status FLP MILSTRIP status phrase (if it exists).
         4.14.2.2.7. RCD 4A – local purchase (LP) status data (if it exists).
         4.14.2.2.8. RCD 4B – LP status phrase (if it exists).
         4.14.2.2.9. RCD 5A – shipment status data (if it exists).
         4.14.2.2.10. RCD 6A – part number record setup (if it exists).
         4.14.2.2.11. RCD 6B – part number data (if it exists).
         4.14.2.2.12. RCD 7A – end item financial summary setup.
         4.14.2.2.13. RCD 7B – end item financial summary data.
         4.14.2.2.14. RCD 7C – spacer.
         4.14.2.2.15. RCD 8A – org/shop financial summary setup.
         4.14.2.2.16. RCD 8B – org/shop financial summary data.
     4.14.2.3. AWP due-out detail records have an urgency justification code (UJC) of ‘AR’
     or ‘BR’.
     4.14.2.4. The due-out and DIFM information are printed on the same line. Activity code
     ‘E’ (mark-for due-out document number) and transaction exception code (TEX) ‘E’
     contain only due-out data. AWP data from the map-rec record will be printed below the
     due-out and DIFM print line if a map-rec record exists.
 284                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


       4.14.2.5. The due-in and status detail records for each due-out are printed following the
       AWP data. The part number linked to the due-out stock number will be printed after the
       due-in and status details.
       4.14.2.6. When the listing is produced in DIFM document number/due-out mark-for
       sequence, the listing will include financial information for each end item. For each end
       item, the listing will show the extended cost. This figure will be computed using the
       exchange price for budget code ‘8’ items and the standard price for all other items. Since
       there is no valid mark-for/end item for TEX code ‘E’ due-outs, the extended cost for
       these items will appear as $0.00. The listing will also show the total dollar value of all
       bits/pieces on order against the end item. In addition, the listing will reflect a percentage
       comparison of the exchange price to the total dollar value of bits and pieces (total dollar
       value of bits/pieces divided by the exchange price). This information will allow resource
       managers to decide whether it is economically feasible to repair the end item.
       4.14.2.7. The DIFM document number/due-out mark-for sequence will also provide
       financial totals for each organization/shop code. When the org/shop changes, the listing
       will print the total extended cost for all end items and the total dollar value of all
       bits/pieces for that org/shop.

   4.14.4. Computed Fields.
       4.14.4.1. AWP COST (PER DUE-OUT). This value is computed (per due-out) as the
       due-out quantity * unit price.
       4.14.4.2. DIFM EXTENDED COST. This value is the exchange cost (if it exists) for
       each end item stock number or due-out.
       4.14.4.3. REPAIR COST. This value is computed by taking the AWP cost (per due-out)
       and dividing it by the DIFM extended cost.
       4.14.4.4. END ITEM / $ VALUE AWP. Upon change of the end item document number
       in the mark for field, this is computed by adding (SUM) the AWP cost per due-out for all
       applicable document numbers. (Note: This field was created to provide totals like the
       legacy report.)
       4.14.4.5. ORG/SHOP TOTAL $ AWP. Upon change of organization/shop code, this is
       computed by adding (SUM) the AWP cost per due-out. (Note: This field was created to
       provide totals like the legacy report.)
 286                                                      AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


         4.14.4.6. END ITEM / EXTENDED COST. Upon change of the end item document
         number in the mark for field, this is computed by adding (SUM) the DIFM extended cost
         for all applicable document numbers. (Note: This field was created to provide totals like
         the legacy report.)
         4.14.4.7. ORG/SHOP TOTAL EXT COST. Upon change of organization/shop code,
         this is computed by adding (SUM) the DIFM extended cost. (Note: This field was
         created to provide totals like the legacy report.)
         4.14.4.8. END ITEM (%). Upon change of the end item document number in the mark
         for field, this is computed by adding (SUM) the AWP cost per due-out (for applicable
         document numbers) and dividing that total by the sum (SUM) of the DIFM extended cost
         (for applicable document numbers). The total value for this field is zero if the DIFM
         extended cost = 0. (Note: This field was created to provide totals like the legacy report.)
         4.14.4.9. ORG/SHOP (%). Upon change of the organization/shop code, this is computed
         by adding (SUM) the AWP cost per due-out (for applicable document numbers) and
         dividing that total by the sum (SUM) of the DIFM extended cost (for applicable
         document numbers). The total value for this field is zero if the DIFM extended cost = 0.
         (Note: This field was created to provide totals like the legacy report.)
      4.14.5. Parameters. (Note: Users can either type in their values or select from the provided
      dropdown list.)
         4.14.5.1. Mandatory:

   4.14.7. Special Instructions.
        4.14.7.1. The summary financial data cannot be put in the data files as it won’t allow
        separate totals unless it is a regular interval. However, the due-out cost, percentage, and
        DIFM cost was included for every due-out to allow programmatic sums (within software
        limitations) at the user’s discretion.
        4.14.7.2. The due-out cost and the DIFM cost had to be listed per due-out to allow totals
        by ORG/SHOP and/or MARK FOR changes. This is more information than the legacy
        report displays. Furthermore, three new columns of data (AWP cost (per due-out), DIFM
        extended cost, repair cost) were created to track the costs and percentages.
4.15. Repair Cycle Asset Management List (D23).
   4.15.1. Purpose. To provide a tool for LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel to
   monitor status and maintain visibility of issued assets controlled by maintenance activities
   within the repair cycle using the due-in from maintenance (DIFM) process. It aids
   maintenance activities in controlling reparable processing and DIFM control. Maintenance
   activities must pay close attention to the number of “ISU” and “STA” (Status) days on
   DIFM details. When a budget code 8 (DLR) asset reaches 60 “ISU” days, the organization is
   charged the carcass price for the asset. This report is also used by Maintenance to determine
   work load scheduling and setting repair priorities. It includes overall stockage and asset

  position visibility for each of the assets in the repair cycle, and provides the user with an
  option to build a data file of print images for download to a microcomputer system.
  4.15.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_RC_ASSET_MGT table
  and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters are
  described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was compiled
  using the following criteria:
      4.15.2.1. The primary tables used to build the enterprise table are the
      DUE_IN_FROM_MAINTENANCE_DTL,                    UNSERVICEABLE_DTL,
      REPAIR_CYCLE, REPAIR_CYCLE_QUARTERLY_DATA, and ITEM_TABLE.
      Secondary tables include the ADJUSTED_LEVEL_DTL, BASE_CONSTANTS_1,
      COST_TABLE,       DUE_IN_DTL,    DUE_OUT_DTL,    EXCESS_REPORT_DTL,
      ISG_STOCK_NBR_RELATIONSHIP, PART_NBR_DTL, SPECIAL_CONTROL,
      STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL,               STATUS_LOCAL_PURCHASE_DTL,
      STATUS_SHIP_DTL,          SUPPLY_POINT_DTL,     AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,
      NON_AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,                MSK_DTL,             HPMSK_DTL,
      SPECIAL_SPARES_DTL,                            WRM_IRSP_SPARES_DTL,
      WRM_WCDO_SPARES_DTL, and SRAN_REF_VW.
      4.15.2.2. The ENTERPRISE_RC_ASSET_MGT table data is derived from 27 different
      types of “records” created and then combined. These records were necessary to produce
      the report in a similar display as the legacy SBSS. The record (RCD) types are defined as
      follows:
         4.15.2.2.1. RCD 00 - report identification image (D23).
         4.15.2.2.2. RCD 01 - report sub-identification image and sort (Stock Position Listing,
         Rep Shop/NSN Seq).
         4.15.2.2.3. RCD 02 - first line of header data for base master item.
         4.15.2.2.4. RCD 03 - second line of header data for base master item.

         record data.
         4.15.2.2.9. RCD A2 - first line of data for the base master item and Interchangeable
         and Substitute Group (I&SG) data.
         4.15.2.2.10. RCD A3 - second line of data for the base master item and part number
         data.
         4.15.2.2.11. RCD A4 - spacer for those items in an I&SG, the primary data is
         displayed with the master item, and the A1-A3 data is displayed with the repair
         org/shop of the DIFM item.
         4.15.2.2.12. RCD AA - I&SG stock numbers and data (if it exists).
AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013                                                            295

           I&SG (if they exist).
           4.15.2.2.20. RCD AI - three sets of ten asterisks serving as a separator for the AJ/AK
           record data.
           4.15.2.2.21. RCD AJ - first line of I&SG records other than the base master item.

   4.15.4. Computed Fields.
       4.15.4.1. /RCQ. Commonly referred to as repair cycle time. This field is computed
       using the formula (NET REPAIR CYCLE DAYS divided by the TOTAL RTS). (Note:
       See below for definitions on computations of NET REPAIR CYCLE DAYS and TOTAL
       RTS.)
       4.15.4.2. D/I. This field is the sum of the quantity due-in for all due-in details.
       4.15.4.3. D/O. This field is the sum of the quantity due-out for all due-out details.
       4.15.4.4. DAILY DEMAND RATE (DDR). If the Date of First Demand (DOFD) = ‘0’
       this value is computed using the formula ((Cumulative recurring demands divided by
       180) plus .0005). If the DOFD <> ‘0’ this value is computed using the formula ((Ordinal
       Date minus DOFD) plus .0005).
       4.15.4.5. DIFM WKBLE. This field is the sum of all DIFM detail due-in quantities that
       do not fall under DIFM NWKBLE as explained below.
       4.15.4.6. DIFM NWKBLE. This field is the sum of all DIFM detail due-in quantities
       which meet any of the following conditions. All other DIFM details not meeting one of
       these conditions are considered DIFM WKBLE.
           4.15.4.6.1. The first position of the Current DIFM Status Code is not equal to an ‘F’,
           and the last position of the Current DIFM Status Code is equal to ‘P’.
           4.15.4.6.2. The DIFM Status Flag is equal to a ‘2’ (CREDIT).

     AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,                             NON_AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,
     SPECIAL_SPARES_DTL, and WRM_WCDO_SPARES_DTL.
     4.15.4.11. MRSP BAL. This field is the sum of all on-hand quantities for the
     AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,                           NON_AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,
     SPECIAL_SPARES_DTL, and WRM_WCDO_SPARES_DTL.
     4.15.4.12. MRSP DEPL. This field is the sum of all deployed quantities for the
     AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,                            NON_AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,
     SPECIAL_SPARES_DTL, and WRM_WCDO_SPARES_DTL.
     4.15.4.13. MSK BAL. This field is the sum of all on-hand and deployed quantities for
     the MSK_DTL and HPMSK_DTL.
     4.15.4.14. NET REPAIR CYCLE DAYS. This field is used to compute the ‘/RCQ’
     field. It is computed by taking the sum of the net repair cycle days from the
     REPAIR_CYCLE_QUARTERLY_DATA record where the age code <> ‘5PQ’. In
     simple terms this sums the first four quarters of data.
     4.15.4.15. REQUISITIONING OBJECTIVE (RO). If the SRAN = ‘3101’ then this
     value is computed using the formula (Demand Level plus MSK/HPMSK Quantities On-
     hand plus MSK/HPMSK Deployed Quantities). For all other SRANs this value is
     computed using the following formulas:
        4.15.4.15.1. ERRCD XD2 and XF3 Items:
            4.15.4.15.1.1. If a minimum adjusted stock level is loaded, it is compared to the
            computed demand level with the greater level used as the RO.
            4.15.4.15.1.2. If a maximum adjusted stock level is loaded, it is compared to the
            computed demand level with the smaller level used as the RO.
            4.15.4.15.1.3. If a “pushed” adjusted stock level (RBL/COLT) is loaded, it is
            compared to zero with the greater value used as the RO.
            4.15.4.15.1.4. If a fixed stock level is loaded, the RO is set at one less than the
            fixed level detail quantity or zero, whichever is greater.
        4.15.4.15.2. ERRCD NDx and NFx Items:
            4.15.4.15.2.1. The RO is normally zero, since equipment items are not normally
            authorized for stock. However, if a minimum adjusted stock level is loaded, it is
            compared to the computed demand level with the greater level used as the RO.
     4.15.4.16. SERV BAL. This field is the sum of the ITEM_TABLE serviceable balance.
     4.15.4.17. STA DAY. This field is computed using the formula (Ordinal Date minus
     Date of Last Change (DOLC) on the DIFM detail).
 298                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


         4.15.4.18. SUP PT. This field is the sum of on-hand quantities for the
         SUPPLY_POINT_DTL.
         4.15.4.19. TOTAL RTS. This field is used to compute the ‘/RCQ’ field. It is computed
         by taking the sum of the serviceable repairs (RTS) from the
         REPAIR_CYCLE_QUARTERLY_DATA record where the age code <> ‘5PQ’. In
         simple terms this sums the first four quarters of data.
         4.15.4.20. UJC 1*. This field is the sum of the quantity due-out for all due-outs with
         UJC 1* (where ‘*’ equals any alpha character).
         4.15.4.21. UJC J*. This field is the sum of the quantity due-out for all due-outs with
         UJC J* (where ‘*’ equals any alpha character).
         4.15.4.22. UNSUP REQN. This field is the sum of all authorized unsupportable
         quantities (where the supportability code = ‘R’) for the AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,
         NON_AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,                     SPECIAL_SPARES_DTL,          and
         WRM_WCDO_SPARES_DTL.
         4.15.4.23. UNSUP FISC. This field is the sum of all authorized unsupportable quantities
         (where the supportability code = ‘F’) for the AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,
         NON_AIRBORNE_MRSP_DTL,                     SPECIAL_SPARES_DTL,                     and
         WRM_WCDO_SPARES_DTL.

   4.15.7. Special Instructions.
        4.15.7.1. User-defined Flags/Phrases. The SBSS legacy report allows user-defined
        flags/phrases with the date parameter. Within the legacy code a user can define a flag
        and phrase that gets populated when the “ISU” or “STA” days exceed the established
        criteria. If the user identifies a phrase but forgets the flag, the legacy code populates it
        with a “<” or “<<” depending on which date parameter has been exceeded. Discoverer
        has limited capabilities to meet all of these requirements. Since this is an attempt to
        highlight user-defined, high-priority items, the user can export the data to Excel and sort
        based on their needs.
        4.15.7.2. User-defined Wings. The SBSS legacy report allows user-defined Wings. For
        example, the user can assign various ORGs to specific Wings (e.g. 100-199 to Wing 1
        and 200-299 for Wing 2) to accommodate bases that have multiple Wings. This then
        provides Wing-specific listings at the time the legacy D23 report is processed.
        Discoverer has very limited options to meet this requirement due to lack of
        standardization between the bases. Since this is an attempt to highlight base-specific
        conditions, the user can export the data to Excel and sort based on their needs.
        4.15.7.3. The legacy SBSS 238-record (Weapons Training Spares Detail) did not migrate
        to the AFSCDB. This record is used in numerous computations for the legacy D23 report
        that include total MRSP balance, total MRSP authorized, total MRSP deployed, etc.
        However, it is currently an obsolete/inactive record in the SBSS and has no impact on
        this Discoverer report. Reference Ch 5 for additional information.
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                         307


       4.15.7.4. The legacy report has a column heading of “AD” which is supposed to be
       populated from the W-ADV field name within the code (AWP Advice Code). However,
       this field never gets populated with data and is always blank. Therefore, it was left off
       the table build and has been replaced with spaces in the Discoverer report.
       4.15.7.5. Record number 9B (in the data file) is the same format as record number 9A.
       Record number 9A contains only the totals for the master stock number within an I&SG.
       Record 9B contains the totals for all other stock numbers within an I&SG or totals for a
       stock number not assigned to an I&SG.
       4.15.7.6. Each occurrence of a due-in document number listed with DIFM assets, and no
       status detail on record resulted in a estimated delivery date of ‘05024’ on the legacy
       report. This Discoverer report will reflect ‘00000’ when there is no status detail on
       record.
4.16. Vehicle Asset Listing (M06).
   4.16.1. The M06 report is no longer used by AF vehicle management activities. LIMS EV
   Vehicle View is used.
4.17. BCE Due-Out Status Listing (M09/D03).
   4.17.1. General. Within Discoverer, the M09 program/report is exactly the same as the D03
   (BCE Due-out Status Listing). For a complete breakdown of this report (including program
   logic, tabs, parameters, etc.) please refer to Para. 4.12 in this same chapter.

       code. Item Table data is displayed.
       4.18.2.3. Issue Exception Code (IEX) Options SND Sheet. Accepts parameters for
       SRAN and IEX code. Scans Item Table and selects records based on the parameters and
       retrieves selected records. The SRAN and IEX code are displayed as page items. The
       records are sorted in stock number sequence within SRAN and IEX code. Item Table
       data is displayed.
       4.18.2.4. SND by Whse Sheet.        Accepts parameters for SRAN and
       Warehouse/Stockroom. Scans the Item Table and selects records based on the
 308                                                  AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


       parameters, then retrieves the selected records. The SRAN and Warehouse/Stockroom
       are displayed as page items. The records are sorted in Stock Number sequence within
       SRAN and Warehouse/Stockroom. Item Table data is displayed.
       4.18.2.5. SND by IEX code and Warehouse Sheet. Accepts parameters for SRAN, IEX
       code, and Warehouse/Stockroom. Scans the Item Table and selects records based on the
       parameters, then retrieves the selected records.     The SRAN, IEX code and
       Warehouse/Stockroom are displayed as page items. The records are sorted in stock
       number sequence within SRAN, Warehouse/Stockroom and IEX code. Item Table data
       is displayed.

          4.21.2.1.8. LINE ITEMS/UNITS – OVER/SHORT (Inventory Analysis Summary
          tab):
Totals on the Inventory Analysis Summary tab are calculated by filtering on ADJUSTMENT
TYPE to determine Complete, Sample, or Special and TYPE TRANSACTION PHRASE CODE
to determine Over or Short. Then counting transactions to determine line items, or summing
ACTION QUANTITY to determine units. Specific filters are provided below:
COMPLETE: TYPE ADJUSTMENT CODE = 'A' or 'C'
SAMPLE: TYPE ADJUSTMENT CODE = 'B' or '9'
SPECIAL: TYPE ADJUSTMENT CODE = 'D' or 'F'
OVER: Second position of TYPE TRANSACTION PHRASE CODE = 'B', 'D', 'H', 'L', 'P', 'J', or
‘N'
SHORT: Second position of TYPE TRANSACTION PHRASE CODE does not = 'B', 'D', 'H',
'L', 'P', 'J', or 'N'
For example, SAMPLE LINE ITEMS OVER = The count of transactions where the TYPE
ADJUSTMENT CODE = 'B' or '9' and second position of TYPE TRANSACTION PHRASE
CODE = 'B', 'D', 'H', 'L', 'P', 'J', or 'N'
For example, SAMPLE LINE ITEMS UNDER = The count of transactions where the TYPE
ADJUSTMENT CODE = 'B' or '9' and second position of TYPE TRANSACTION PHRASE
CODE does not = 'B', 'D', 'H', 'L', 'P', 'J', or 'N'

         4.22.7.1. The legacy M30 program included fields for totals (Investment, Expense,
         Total) in the data file. However, that is beyond the capability of Discoverer. Those totals
         are still reflected in the report tabs though and will download if that option is taken.
AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013                                                            319


       4.22.7.2. The legacy M30 program contained a dynamic cover letter. However, that is
       beyond the capability of Discoverer. As a workaround, a generic cover letter is included.
       If the user double-clicks in the text window, they can alter it to fit their needs before they
       export the letter.
4.23. Organization Bench Stock Listing (S04).
   4.23.1. Purpose. To provide listings of items authorized on bench stock for applicable
   activities, control the assignment of bench stock document numbers, and assist shop
   personnel in the location of bench stock items.
   4.23.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_ORG_BENCH_STOCK
   table and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters
   are described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was
   compiled using the following criteria:
       4.23.2.1. The primary tables used to build the enterprise table are the
       MASTER_BENCH_STOCK_DTL and ITEM_TABLE. Secondary tables include the
       PART_NBR_DTL, ORG_COST_CENTER_100_999, SPECIAL_CONTROL, and
       SRAN_REF_TABLE.

   4.23.4. Computed Fields.
       4.23.4.1. B-C GROUP. The grouping of the budget codes as follows: budget code ‘1’ =
       ‘1’, budget code ‘9’ = ‘9’, and all other budget codes = ‘OTHER’ (Tab 5 only).
       4.23.4.2. LI. A count (COUNT) of all line items for each category defined (BC-
       GROUP, ORGSH, ORG, SRAN)… (Tab 5 only).
       4.23.4.3. B/C $ VALUE. The addition (SUM) of all extended authorized dollar values
       (authorized quantity * unit price * .01) for each category defined (BC-GROUP, ORGSH,
       ORG, SRAN)…(Tab 5 only).
       4.23.4.4. LI MRA 1, 3, AND A. A count (COUNT) of all line items for each category
       defined (BC-GROUP, ORGSH, ORG, SRAN) where the MRA_MAQ_FLAG = ‘1’, ‘3’,
       ‘A’ (Tab 5 only).
       4.23.4.5. B/C $ VALUE MRA 1, 3, AND A. The addition (SUM) of all extended
       authorized dollar values (authorized quantity * unit price) for each category defined (BC-
       GROUP, ORGSH, ORG, SRAN) where the MRA_MAQ_FLAG = ‘1’, ‘3’, ‘A’ (Tab 5
       only).
       4.23.4.6. COMP. The computed value is the daily demand rate (CUM DMD / (current
       date - DOFD)) times the day requirement (based on the MRA_MAQ_FLAG).
       MRA_MAQ_FLAG ‘1’, ‘2’ = 30 days, ‘E’, ‘3’, ‘4’ = 45 days, and ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ = 60
       days. When the MRA_MAQ_FLAG is blank or ‘D’, the bench stock stockage days will
       be used from the organization record. If the bench stock stockage days is zero, 30 days
       will be used. Within the daily demand rate formula, if the (current date – DOFD) is less
       than 90 days than 90 days will be used.
       4.23.4.7. EXTENDED AUTH $ VALUE.                The computed value is the authorized
       quantity * unit price * .01.
   4.23.5. Parameters. (Note: Users can either type in their values or select from the provided
   dropdown list.)
       4.23.5.1. Mandatory:
           4.23.5.1.1. SRAN. The query must have at least one SRAN entry. This field will be
           edited as a four-digit alpha-numeric character string. Multiple SRAN(s) (if used)
           must be separated by commas.
       4.23.5.2. Optional:
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                             321


          4.23.5.2.1. ORG CODE. The user may input one or many ORGs. If this field is left
          blank it will select all. Multiple ORGs (if used) must be separated by commas.
          4.23.5.2.2. ORGSHOP CODE. The user may input one or many organization/shop
          codes. If this field is left blank it will select all. Multiple organization/shop codes (if
          used) must be separated by commas.
          4.23.5.2.3. SHELF LIFE CODE. The user may input one or many shelf life codes.
          If this field is left blank it will select all. Multiple shelf life codes (if used) must be
          separated by commas. The shelf-life code option is not available on Tab 5.
   4.23.6. Data File Formats. None.
   4.23.7. Special Instructions.
      4.23.7.1. The legacy system stores invalid Date of First Demand (DOFD) values at
      times. Examples include dates in the future, Julian dates greater than 366 day, and leap
      days (366 day) in non-leap years. To prevent the Discoverer report from generating an
      error, the current date is used whenever those situations are encountered.
      4.23.7.2. Suspect MRA_MAQ_QTY data is also stored at times on the legacy system.
      To prevent the Discoverer report from generating an error, the value of ‘0’ is assigned
      whenever those situations are encountered.
      4.23.7.3. The legacy COBOL program and Discoverer Oracle software use different date
      difference and rounding functions for the ‘COMP’ field. In most cases Discoverer
      rounded the number up by a total of one. Therefore, if comparing this field between the
      legacy and Discoverer reports there may be a slight difference in the final value.
4.24. Priority Requirements Action List (R01).
   4.24.1. Purpose. To provide a program which provides the stock control activity a listing to
   selectively monitor priority requirements and suspect problem due-outs.
   4.24.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_PRIORITY_RQMTS
   table and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters
   are described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was
   compiled using the following criteria:
      4.24.2.1. The primary tables used to build the enterprise table are the DUE_OUT_DTL,
      DUE_IN_DTL,                                            STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL,
      STATUS_LOCAL_PURCHASE_DTL, and ITEM_TABLE. Secondary tables include
      the       ISG_STOCK_NBR_RELATIONSHIP,                  SPECIAL_CONTROL,          and
      SRAN_REF_TABLE.
      4.24.2.2. Due-out detail records selected must meet the following criteria:
          4.24.2.2.1. Transaction exception (TEX) code must be unequal to ‘H’.
          4.24.2.2.2. UND must be equal to (‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’).
          4.24.2.2.3. TAC must be equal to (‘B’, ‘E’).
          4.24.2.2.4. The alpha check field in the ITEM_TABLE must be unequal to ‘X’.
 322                                                     AFH23-123V2PT4           8 AUGUST 2013


       4.24.2.3. Due-out detail records will be excluded if both the TEX code is equal to ‘8’ and
       TAC is equal to ‘E’.
       4.24.2.4. Due-out detail records will be excluded if both the UND is equal to ‘C’ and the
       stock number (including any stock number within the Interchangeable and Substitute
       Group (ISG) if it exists) has a requirements computation flag equal to ‘R’.
       4.24.2.5. For each due-out selected, the program looks for linked due-in and status
       (STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL, STATUS_LOCAL_PURCHASE_DTL ) details;
       including unlinked ISG information. If the row of data (in the listing) contains a due-in
       that is not linked, the phrase ‘UNLINKED DUE IN’ will be populated in the
       ‘NOMENCLATURE’ column.
       4.24.2.6. For ease of printing this report, each due-out is assigned a ‘PART’ value in the
       enterprise table ranging from 1-4. After applying all of the business rules stated above,
       the following additional conditions are used to determine the specific part that the due-
       out is assigned:
           4.24.2.6.1. ‘1’. Assigned to due-outs with UND ‘A’ or ‘B’ and not linked to a valid
           due-in for the same stock number. The ISG data is provided. Due-outs linked to a
           valid due-in are excluded from this part. Due-outs with UND ‘B’ and routing
           identifier equal to (‘S9T’, ‘SMS’, ‘Gxx’) are also excluded as they are assigned to
           Part ‘4’ under the right conditions.
           4.24.2.6.2. ‘2’. Assigned to due-outs with UND ‘A’ or ‘B’ (except TAC ‘E’ due-
           outs with blank TEX code) that have a due-in over 4 days old and no supply/ship
           status, or the follow-up date is past due, or the status indicates follow-up action (99 or
           less), or the supply status is (‘BA’, ‘BH’, ‘BV’) and the estimated delivery date has
           passed.
           4.24.2.6.3. ‘3’. Assigned to due-outs with UND ‘A’ or ‘B’ (except TAC ‘E’ due-
           outs with blank TEX code), no cancellation code in the due-in field, requisition date
           exceeds the age selected in the parameter (‘PARAMETER DAYS’), and the due-out
           has an unsatisfactory status of (‘BB’, ‘BC’, ‘BD’, ‘BP’).
           4.24.2.6.4. ‘4’. Assigned to due-outs with UND ‘C’ with no due-ins for the due-out
           stock number, or due-outs with UND ‘B’ and routing identifier equal to (‘S9T’,
           ‘SMS’, ‘Gxx’) and no due-ins for the due-out stock number, or any due-out with no
           due-ins for any stock number in ISG (master and interchangeable relationships only)
           and item record (single item or group item) is not flagged for releveling, or any due-
           out that has been unlinked, or any due-out that has been cancelled.
   4.24.3. Tabs (Also known as sheets and worksheets).
       4.24.3.1. Tab 1 (Glossary).
Condition(s): None.
Sort(s): Sort by column headings.
       4.24.3.2. Tab 2 (Part 1).

       15, and 16-20. The program creates all other totals from due-out details.
       4.27.2.5. When there is no valid status for a due-in detail with a LP routing identifier
       code (positions 1-2 = 'JB', 'JG', 'JD', 'JS' and position 3 = 'B', 'C', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'K', 'L', 'S',
       'P'), the phrase ‘NO LP STATUS’ will be printed. The listing will also contain the due-
       out document number for which the requisition was submitted.

4.42. Status FLP MILSTRIP / Without Due-In (ACC102).
   4.42.1. Purpose. To provide a listing to identify all MILSTRIP follow-up status and
   shipment status details with no matching due-in.
   4.42.2. Program Logic. This program does not require an enterprise table. It scans the
   AFSCDB and builds several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and
   parameters are described in detail in various sections below. The data for this report was
   compiled using the following criteria:
       4.42.2.1. The primary tables used to build this report are the DUE_IN_DTL,
       STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL, and STATUS_SHIP_DTL. Secondary tables include
       the ITEM_TABLE, SPECIAL_CONTROL, and SRAN_REF_TABLE.
       4.42.2.2. The program compares status details (except LP) against due-in details. If a
       matching due-in does not exist (for status ship details the supplementary address must
       also not be equal to “TARREC”), a listing is produced and a delete image is written in a
       data file format to delete the “orphan” 208 (STATUS-FLP-MILSTRIP-DETAIL), 211
       (STATUS-SHIP-DETAIL), and 103 (DOCUMENT-NBR) records on the legacy system.
   4.42.3. Tabs (Also known as sheets and worksheets).
       4.42.3.1. Tab 1 (FLP List).

      4.42.4. Computed Fields. None.
      4.42.5. Parameters. (Note: Users can either type in their values or select from the provided
      dropdown list.)
         4.42.5.1. Mandatory:
             4.42.5.1.1. SRAN. The query must have at least one SRAN entry. This field will be
             edited as a four-digit alpha-numeric character string. Multiple SRANs (if used) must
             be separated by commas. (Note: It is strongly recommended that you only input a
             single SRAN or SRANs with a “Host-Satellite” relationship. Due to legacy input
             formats, multiple SRANs would be impossible to tell apart in the QLP Update files
             because the SRAN field is not part of the file).

      4.42.7. Special Instructions.
         4.42.7.1. The data files created need to be processed with QLP Update. This requires a
         computer operations database manager with QLP update access to complete the required
         action.
         4.42.7.2. The legacy SURGE program sends summary data to the console type-out along
         with display messages. Although Discoverer doesn’t have that capability, a summary
         count of these images (Tabs 1 and 4) is provided in its place.
 344                                                   AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


       4.42.7.3. Discoverer does not have the ability to use a legacy 103-document number to
       build the QLP statements because that record does not exist in the AFSCDB. As a
       workaround, the 208 (STATUS_FLP_MILSTRIP_DTL) and 211 (STATUS_SHIP_DTL)
       document numbers are used. Since there is a 103 record for every document number that
       exists in the legacy system this is a viable strategy.
4.43. Reparable Support Division (RSD) DIFM Report (ACC200).
   4.43.1. Purpose. To provide LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel, AFMC materiel
   management personnel, and MAJCOM personnel with a dollar value of budget code 8 DIFM
   items by DIFM status code, using the exchange price.
   4.43.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_RSD_DIFM_VALUE
   table and build several listings and data files based on user input parameters. The listings,
   data files, and parameters are described in detail in various sections below. The data for the
   enterprise table was compiled using the following criteria:
       4.43.2.1. The enterprise table requires data from 10 tables and one view. The primary
       table used to build the enterprise table is the DUE_IN_FROM_MAINTENANCE_DTL.
       Secondary      tables    include     the      BASE_CONSTANTS_1,        COST_TABLE,
       DUE_OUT_DTL,                       ITEM_TABLE,                  ORG_COST_CENTER,
       ORG_COST_CENTER_100_999, PROJECT_FUNDS_MGMT, REPAIR_CYCLE,
       SPECIAL_CONTROL, and SRAN_REF_VW.
           4.43.2.1.1. In general terms, the serviceable DIFM detail records for this enterprise
           table are scanned as follows:
              4.43.2.1.1.1. First two positions of the ERRCD must equal ‘XD’.
              4.43.2.1.1.2. Budget code must equal ‘8’.
              4.43.2.1.1.3. All activity code ‘C’ DIFM details meeting the above criteria are
              selected. For activity code other than ‘C’, the DIFM status flag must be in (‘0’,
              ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘4’).
       4.43.2.2. The exchange price and the markup price are multiplied by the quantity due-in
       to    obtain   the   enterprise    table   EXTENDED_EXCHANGE_PRICE                 and
       EXTENDED_MARKUP_PRICE values.
       4.43.2.3. Total dollar values are computed by DIFM status code for both ‘AWP’ and
       non-AWP assets. Year of obligation for the DIFM due-out is also broken out by current
       fiscal year (FY), previous FY, and no obligation.

   4.43.4. Computed Fields.
       4.43.4.1. AWP. Populated from the enterprise table value ‘NBR_AWP_DAYS’. If the
       last position of the current DIFM status code = ‘P’ and position one is not in (‘F’, ‘C’)
       then this value is computed using the formula (NBR_AWP_DAYS +
       NBR_NUM_DAYS). Otherwise, this value is computed using only NBR_AWP Days. If
       the value computed is less than zero a value of ‘0’ is used.
       4.43.4.2. CHRG.             Populated  from    the     enterprise      table   value
       ‘NBR_CHARG_STAT_DAYS’. If the ISU_DOR_DATE = ‘0’ the value is ‘0’. If the
       DIFM status code is in (‘CTR’, ‘PDM’, ‘TCG’,’TOC’) then this value is computed using
       the       formula         (NBR_ISSUE_DAYS       –       (NBR_AWP_DAYS              +
       DELAYED_OTHER_DAYS) – NBR_NUM_ DAYS).                     Otherwise, this value is
       computed using the formula (NBR_ISSUE_DAYS - (NBR_AWP_DAYS +
       DELAYED_OTHER_DAYS)). If the end value in either formula is less than zero a
       value of ‘0’ is assigned.
       4.43.4.3. FY OBLIGATION. If the DIFM detail with a DIFM status flag of ‘1’ doesn’t
       have a matching due-out document number, this field gets populated as ‘NO’. Otherwise,
       the standard FY obligation code applies and used to populate the applicable column of
       the report.
       4.43.4.4. ISS. Populated from the enterprise table value ‘NBR_ISSUE_DAYS’. This
       value is computed using the formula (REQUISITION_DATE – ISU_DOR_DATE
       (positions 4-7)). If any of the dates in the formula fall outside a normal Julian date range
       or the grand total is a negative number a value of ‘0’ is assigned.
       4.43.4.5. NBR OF DAYS SINCE DOLC. Populated from the enterprise table value
       ‘NBR_NUM_DAYS’.        This value is computed using the formula
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                            347


     (REQUISITION_DATE – DATE_OF_LAST_CHANGE). If any of the dates in the
     formula fall outside a normal Julian date range or the grand total is a negative number a
     value of ‘0’ is assigned.
     4.43.4.6. PBR. If the Percent Base Repair (PBR) value is null then it is converted to
     ‘NOR’. If the value is ‘111’ it is converted to ‘0’. If the value is ‘99’ it is converted to
     ‘100’. Otherwise, the standard PBR value applies and used to populate the applicable
     column of the report.
     4.43.4.7. TOT. Populated from the enterprise table value ‘NBR_STAT_DAYS’. If the
     activity code <> ‘S’ the number of status days is computed using the formula
     (REQUISITION_DATE – DUE_IN_DATE_SERIAL_NBR (positions 1-4)). If the
     activity code = ‘S’ the number of status days is computed using the formula
     (REQUISITION_DATE – ISU_DOR_DATE (positions 4-7). If any of the dates in either
     formula fall outside a normal Julian date range or the grand total is a negative number a
     value of ‘0’ is assigned.

   4.43.7. Special Instructions.
       4.43.7.1. The legacy SURGE program has a major discrepancy as it computes the
       chargeable status days. The SBSS can have uninitialized data in the 203-DELAYED-
       OTHER-DAYS and 203-AWP-DAYS which is represented as the number “16416”. This
       value should actually be zero in these circumstances. The SURGE does NOT convert the
       value, but subtracts the sum of these two fields from the Issue Days computation
       resulting in a negative number. The negative number is then converted to zero and
       displayed in the SURGE. For example:
Issue Days computes to 128 days (current date minus the 203-ISU-DOR-DATE)
203-AWP-DAYS = 0
203-DELAYED-OTHER-DAYS = 16416 (uninitialized value, should be 0)
128 – (0+16416) = -16288, which the SURGE converts to 0
The actual computation should be: 128 – (0+0) = 128. Once fielded as a duplicate to the current
SBSS program, a future enhancement will be requested by AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity to do an internal computation to change the “16416” value to zero for these
columns of data.
       4.43.7.2. The legacy SURGE output file is hard-coded to FTP to HQ ACC. However,
       this is beyond the capability of Discoverer so the end user (or designated representative)
       will now be required to process/download this file and FTP to another location (if
       needed).
       4.43.7.3. The data file format has changed. The legacy SURGE would print part of the
       record on 2 separate lines. Discoverer can only print once per line of data, so lines 1 and
       2 of the SBSS version are line one of the Discoverer version, lines 3 and 4 of the SBSS
       version are Discoverer line 2, etc. The new format will be a major change if a program
       reads the data file to parse it out for other programs.
       4.43.7.4. The legacy SURGE lists DIFM items with the phrase “ORG NOT LOADED”
       but this will not be duplicated in Discoverer. These items do not migrate to the AFSCDB
       because the DUE_IN_FROM_MAINTENANCE table requires the organization record to
       be loaded before the DIFM record will load. These DIFM details are identified in the
       error logs during the AFSCDB migration.
       4.43.7.5. The legacy SURGE populates the phrase ‘ORG NOT LOADED’ in the TITLE
       heading of the report when bad PFMRs are encountered; usually as a result of user input
       in the parameter card. This will not be duplicated in Discoverer. User can always select
       from the drop-down list of valid PFMRs which will prevent this scenario from
       happening.
       4.43.7.6. The legacy SURGE populates the phrase ‘AWP DETAILS WERE NOT
       LISTED PER PARAMETER CARD’ as a result of user input. This will not be
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                           351


       duplicated in Discoverer. User will now directly input the parameters and have full
       knowledge of what information was requested.
4.44. Repair Cycle Efficiency Report (ACC203).
   4.44.1. Purpose. To provide MAJCOM and base level personnel with repair time estimates
   for Consolidated Activity Group-Supply (CSAG-S) DIFM items. This report tracks CSAG-S
   DIFM items from the time of issue to the time of turn-in. The time will be calculated by days
   into six buckets; pre-repair delay, repair, post-repair delay, awaiting parts, contract
   maintenance, and ICBM maintenance awaiting installation.
   4.44.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_RC_EFFICIENCY table
   and build a daily listing or monthly data file based on user input parameters. The listing, data
   file, and parameters are described in detail in various sections below. The data for the
   enterprise table was compiled using the following criteria:
       4.44.2.1. The primary table used to build the enterprise table is the
       TRANSACTION_HISTORY.        Secondary tables include the COST_TABLE,
       DUE_IN_FROM_MAINTENANCE_DTL, ITEM_TABLE, REPAIR_CYCLE, and
       SRAN_REF_TABLE.
       4.44.2.2. Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) for all stock numbers must be equal to
       (‘DUO’, ‘ISU’, ‘MSI’) and TRANSACTION_PHRASE_CODE must equal ‘2P’.
          4.44.2.2.1. Active DIFM detail records are then updated when the TRIC is equal to
          DOR, Type Transaction Phrase Code (TTPC) is equal to ‘1A’, and the
          ISU_DOR_DATE is null. Any records meeting those conditions will have the
          ISU_DOR_DATE set equal to the transaction history requisition date.
          4.44.2.2.2. Active DIFM detail records continue to have the various “buckets of
          time” (i.e. CURRENT_DIFM_STATUS_CODE, PREVIOUS_DIFM_STATUS, etc.)
          updated until meeting the conditions for a closed record. The “clock” representing
          the time in each “bucket” will start on the day the part is released from the
          LRS/Materiel Management Activity, or the date of the first DFM change; whichever
          is first. The start date will always be counted as one day. Multiple changes of the
          DIFM status code on the same day will not be tracked. Only the last DIFM status
          code will be used to compute each “bucket”.
          4.44.2.2.3. Active DIFM detail records are closed when the TRIC is equal to TIN,
          the TTPC is equal to (‘2M’, ‘2O’, ‘2U’), and the TIN_DATE was null at that time.
       4.44.2.3. Since TRANSACTION_HISTORY is the primary table used for this report,
       there is an additional daily check for missing active DIFM detail records caused by failed
       or skipped migrations.

   4.44.7. Special Instructions.
       4.44.7.1. There is no primary option (like existed in the legacy SURGE) to update
       changes between long days (multiple calendar days for a single business day).
       4.44.7.2. New DIFM detail records (for a date that has already passed) may appear on
       the listing if the same report parameters are processed at a later point in time. The legacy
       SURGE report maintains historical records based on transactions. If the transaction was
       not recorded by the legacy SURGE on the day that it happened, it is not managed by the
       program.
       4.44.7.3. The legacy output file is hard-coded to FTP to various sites. However, this is
       beyond the capability of Discoverer so the end user (or designated representative) will
       now be required to process/download this file and FTP to another location (if needed).
4.45. Combat Oriented Supply Organization (COSO) Effectiveness Report (ACC214).
   4.45.1. Purpose. To provide a management tool for validating the support provided by
   COSO warehouses (i.e. Aircraft Parts Store (APS) and/or Flight Service Center (FSC)). This
   report includes a listing of items ordered by aircraft maintenance activities but currently not
   stocked in the APS or FSC. It also includes stockage/storage effectiveness rates based on
   user-defined parameters for ORGs and warehouses. The assets are stratified by both
   economic order quantity (EOQ) and reparable assets and there is both a daily and monthly
   option of this report. When managers review the listing(s) and a firm decision is made not to
   move the property to the applicable COSO warehouse, action should be taken to load
   application code ‘NO’ to the item record. MAJCOMs and LRS’s/Materiel Management
   Activities may assign additional codes. However, only application codes ‘N?’ (where ‘?’ is
   a wildcard), ‘XX’, ‘X3’, ‘X6’, and ‘Y2’ are considered COSO assets when computing
   stockage/storage rates.
   4.45.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_COSO_EFFECT table
   and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters are
   described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was compiled
   using the following criteria:
       4.45.2.1. The primary table used to build the enterprise table is the
       TRANSACTION_HISTORY.        Secondary tables include the ITEM_TABLE,
       ORG_COST_CENTER, SPECIAL_CONTROL, and SRAN_REF_TABLE.
          4.45.2.1.1. In general terms, the transaction history records for this enterprise table
          are scanned as follows:
               4.45.2.1.1.1. TRIC must be in (‘DUO’, ‘ISU’, ‘MSI’).
               4.45.2.1.1.2. System designator must be equal to ‘01’ with one additional SRAN
               (FB4817) included since it was the only satellite account running this report at the
               time of development.
               4.45.2.1.1.3. TTPCs for ISU/MSI transactions must be in (‘1A’, ’1C’, ’1E’, ’1G’,
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                            355


              ’1I’, ’1O’, ’1Q’, ’2I’, ’2K’, ’3P’, ’3Q’, ’5C’, ’5E’, ’5I’, ’6C’, ’6J’, ’6N’) and
              TTPCs for DUO transactions must be in (‘2D’, ’4W’).
              4.45.2.1.1.4. Activity codes for due-outs must be in (‘B’, ’J’, ’R’, ’S’, ’U’, ’X’).
              4.45.2.1.1.5. Transactions are bypassed when IEX is equal to ‘E’ or ’K’.
              4.45.2.1.1.6. Transactions are bypassed when Type Account Code is equal to ‘K’
              or ’P’.
              4.45.2.1.1.7. Transactions are bypassed when SRD is equal to ‘ZZZ’ unless the
              second position of the UJC is equal to ‘R’.
              4.45.2.1.1.8. Transactions are bypassed when the shop code is equal to ‘TC’ or
              ‘TO’.
           4.45.2.1.2. For the monthly option of this report, a current (defined as date of last
           migration) warehouse location and application code check is conducted and compared
           against the user-defined COSO warehouses. If the stock number is now assigned to a
           COSO warehouse or the application code indicates the stock number will not be
           moved forward the document number(s) will not be printed on the listing.

      100 + .5). (Note: This occurs within each user-defined ORG CODE. All identified
      fields must take place before the formula can be executed).
      4.45.4.22. STK-NO (For Recoverable category). The COSO stockage effectiveness rate
      (exceptions provided for application codes) is computed using the formula: IF
      ENTERPRISE_COSO_EFFECT.EOQ_RECOVERABLE_IND = ‘R’ THEN TRUNC
      ((COSO ISSUE + COSO MSI) / (COSO ISSUE + COSO MSI + COSO B/O + OTHER
      ISSUE + OTHER MSI + OTHER B/O - COUNT(CASE WHEN
      ENTERPRISE_COSO_EFFECT.APP_CD_STK_STORE_RATE_INCL_IND = ‘NO’) *
      100 + .5). (Note: This occurs within each user-defined ORG CODE. All identified
      fields must take place before the formula can be executed).
      4.45.4.23. TOTALS (For both EOQ and Recoverable categories). Within each category,
      sum the individual columns of data known as (’COSO ISSUE’,’COSO MSI’,’OTHER
      ISSUE’,’OTHER MSI’,’COSO B/O’,’OTHER B/O’,’4W B/O’) and then compute the
      individual   columns    of    data   known     as (‘COSO      STORAGE’,’COSO
      STOCKAGE’,’STOR-NO’,’STK-NO’) using their respective formulas.
      4.45.4.24. TOTAL HITS FOR STOCK NUMBER: Within each category, this is the
      number of line items (for each stock number) with TRIC ‘ISU’ or ‘MSI’ where the org
      code of the document number was equal to one of the user-defined org code(s) and the
AFH23-123V2PT4        8 AUGUST 2013                                                          359


     first two positions of the warehouse location were not equal to the user-defined COSO
     WAREHOUSE(s) or the application code was not in (’XX’,’X3’,’X6’,’Y2’) or the first
     position of the application code was not equal to ‘N’. (Note: Only applies to Tab 3
     (Monthly Report)).
     4.45.4.25. EOQ_RECOVERABLE_IND. Assigned within the enterprise table and
     determines what category the transaction will be assigned. If the first two positions of the
     ERRCD equals ‘XB’ then ‘E’ is assigned. If the first two positions of the ERRCD is in
     (‘XD’, ‘XF’) then ‘R’ is assigned.
     4.45.4.26. APP_CD_STK_STORE_RATE_INCL_IND. Assigned within the enterprise
     table and used to determine whether to include or exclude the transaction when
     computing the various stockage/storage rates.            If the application code is in
     (‘XX’,’X3’,’X6’,’Y2’) or the first position of the application code is equal to ‘N’ then the
     value ‘NO’ is assigned. Otherwise, the value ‘YES’ is assigned.
  4.45.5. Parameters. (Note: Users can either type in their values or select from the provided
  dropdown list.)
     4.45.5.1. Mandatory:
         4.45.5.1.1. SRAN. The query must have a SRAN entry. Multiple SRAN entries are
         not allowed. This field will be edited as a four-digit alpha-numeric character string.
         4.45.5.1.2. COSO WAREHOUSE. The user must input at least one COSO
         WAREHOUSE entry. Multiple COSO WAREHOUSE entries (if used) must be
         separated by a comma. This field will be edited as a two-digit numeric character
         string.
         4.45.5.1.3. ORG CODE. The user must input at least one ORG CODE entry. Each
         ORG CODE can only be assigned to one ORG MDS. Multiple ORG CODE entries
         (if used) must be separated by a comma. This field will be edited as a three-digit
         numeric character string.
         4.45.5.1.4. ORG MDS. The user must input at least one user-defined MDS entry.
         This gets linked to a specific ORG CODE. Maximum number of positions is six
         (nine counting the ORG CODE). For example, ORG 100 assigned to ‘F15’ would be
         ‘100F15’. Multiple MDS entries (per ORG CODE) are not allowed. Multiple MDS
         entries must be separated by a slash. For example, ORG 100 assigned to ‘F15’ and
         ORG 222 assigned to ‘C5’ would be ‘100F15/222C5’.
         4.45.5.1.5. TYPE WHSE. For each MDS the user must select ‘APS’ for Aircraft
         Parts Store or ‘FSC’ for Flight Service Center to indicate the type of COSO
         warehouse the MDS is supported by. The default is ‘APS’.
     4.45.5.2. Optional: None.
  4.45.6. Data File Formats. None.
  4.45.7. Special Instructions.
     4.45.7.1. The legacy SURGE has both a daily and monthly option. The option processed
     is determined based on computer date and not parameter input. The daily report is based
     on date of last migration. However, when the program recognizes the month has changed
 360                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


       the monthly option is immediately processed. For example, if you ask for the monthly
       option in the middle of June you will still get results for the month of May. Therefore,
       the enterprise table gets appended to each day instead of being overwritten. AFMC
       SCM-R Information Technology Activity will add a step to their housekeeping
       procedures and periodically delete any excess records. The expectation is that
       approximately 62 days (two months) worth of data will be maintained.
       4.45.7.2. The legacy SURGE was originally built solely for system designator 01.
       However, this SURGE was recently modified for FB4817, the A2 account on Nellis
       AFB. It is considered a special version of the same SURGE and only runs on that
       database. In order to totally eliminate the current need for the legacy SURGE we added
       SRAN FB4817 to the established criteria for this enterprise table.
       4.45.7.3. The legacy SURGE has a parameter file that allows an ORG to be assigned to
       multiple user-defined MDS names. However, the legacy SURGE only prints the data one
       time meaning all subsequent instances of the ORG will reflect zeros on the report. Since
       the Discoverer report can only use a print line one time, criteria for the parameters on the
       report include limiting an ORG to a single MDS.
       4.45.7.4. Due to Discoverer limitations, the exact format of the legacy SURGE cannot be
       duplicated. However, almost all of the same information has been provided. For
       example, rather than a legacy header of “COSO EOQ STORAGE/STOCKAGE
       EFFECTIVENESS” or an “MDS =F15”, these items are now placed in columns of data
       as in “COSO STORAGE” – “EOQ” and “MDS” – “F15”.
4.46. Budget Code 8 Cost Validation (ACC221).
   4.46.1. Purpose. To provide a listing of all budget code ‘8’ assets that have questionable
   prices loaded to the item and/or cost records.
   4.46.2. Program Logic. This program does not require an enterprise table. It scans the
   AFSCDB and builds several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and
   parameters are described in detail in various sections below. The data for this report was
   compiled using the following criteria:
       4.46.2.1. The primary tables used to build this report are the ITEM_TABLE and
       COST_TABLE.         Secondary tables include the SPECIAL_CONTROL and
       SRAN_REF_TABLE.
       4.46.2.2. The stock number must have a budget code of ‘8’ and a Date of Last
       Transaction greater than ‘0’ in order to be considered for review. From there the program
       performs several computations and produces several listings to include a 1SQ data file
       that should be processed in-line as a Stock Number Users Directory stock number
       interrogation.

   4.46.7. Special Instructions.
         4.46.7.1. Parts of the legacy SURGE program suggested that positions 171-172 of the
         HQ data file (Tab 12) should be populated with the report part and ERRCD type.
         However, testing revealed those fields were only used in the sort logic and the data file
         always returned a value of ‘FB’.
         4.46.7.2. Some parts of this report include (and are sorted by) two types of items; XD
         stock numbers and non-XD stock numbers. The non-XD stock numbers do not possess
364                                                  AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


      all the cost data that XD items possess (e.g. Exchange Price).            Therefore, these
      positions/columns are not populated for the non-XD items.
      4.46.7.3. The 1SQ data file needs to be processed in the legacy system (e.g. pseudo).
      This usually requires a computer operations database manager to complete the required
      action.
      4.46.7.4. The HQ data file was previously forwarded automatically from the legacy
      system to a specific file server. However, this is beyond the capability of Discoverer so
      the end user (or designated representative) will now be required to process/download this
      file.
4.47. HAZMART Matrix Report (ACC250).
  4.47.1. Purpose. To provide a listing of items with IEX 8, 9, or M and generate an IEX
  totals summary of various attributes.
  4.47.2. Program Logic.
      4.47.2.1. HAZMART MATRIX. Accepts parameter for a single SRAN or multiple
      SRANs. Scans item table and retrieves records assigned an IEX 8, 9, or M for selected
      SRAN(s). The SRAN and system designator are displayed as Page Items. Records are
      sorted by system designator (for multiple SRAN selections), IEX, then stock number.
      4.47.2.2. IEX Summary. Accepts parameter for a single SRAN or multiple SRANs.
      Scans item table and provides summary of records assigned an IEX 8, 9, or M for
      selected SRAN(s). The SRAN and system designator are displayed as Page Items.
      Records are sorted by IEX and SRAN/system designator if multiple SRANs are selected.
      4.47.2.3. Computed Fields.
         4.47.2.3.1. Total Number of Line            Items    =   Count    of     cases   where

         4.47.2.3.2. Total Number Serviceable Units in                Stock =         Sum of
         ITEM_TABLE.SERVICEABLE_BALANCE            for                    cases          where
         ITEM_TABLE.IEX_CODE is 8, 9, or M.
         4.47.2.3.3. Total Number with Demand Level = Count of cases where
         ITEM_TABLE.IEX_CODE is 8, 9, or M and ITEM_TABLE.DEMAND_LEVEL is
         greater than 0.
         4.47.2.3.4. Total    Dollar Value  of  Demand Level =   Sum    of
         ITEM_TABLE.DEMAND_LEVEL for cases where ITEM_TABLE.IEX_CODE is 8,
         9 or M multiplied by ITEM_TABLE.UNIT_PRICE.
         4.47.2.3.5. Total Number Assigned MAX Level = Count of cases where

   (FSC) summaries for a selected date range.
   4.48.2. Program Logic. This program does not require an enterprise table. It scans the
   AFSCDB and builds several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and
   parameters are described in detail in various sections below. The data for this report was
   compiled using the following criteria:
       4.48.2.1. The primary tables used to build this report are the ITEM_TABLE and
       CT_HISTORY table.       Secondary tables include the SPECIAL_CONTROL and
       SRAN_REF_TABLE.
       4.48.2.2. The program scans the CTH area based on user-defined FROM/TO dates
       looking for ‘TRM’ transactions that have a type transaction phrase code (TTPC) <>
       ‘CA’.
       4.48.2.3. The federal stock class (FSC) must be equal to one of the following in order to

   support to MAJCOMs. This program provides a single process to obtain data that would
   normally come from SBSS programs that include NGV934, D26, and R72. It also combines
   data from due-out details similar to the R-31 program.
       4.50.1.1. There are twelve different types of “records” built and displayed.        The
       following is a brief summary of the records:
           4.50.1.1.1. ^* - Report run image.

         4.50.1.1.12. ^Z - Record Count.
  4.50.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_SUPERSCAN table and
  build two listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters are described
  in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was compiled using the
  following criteria:
      4.50.2.1. The primary tables used to build the enterprise table are the
      ORG_COST_CENTER and TRANSACTION_HISTORY. Secondary tables include the
      BASE_CONSTANTS_1, SPECIAL_CONTROL, COST_TABLE, ITEM_TABLE,
      REPAIR_CYCLE,             DUE_IN_FROM_MAINTENANCE_DTL,                     DUE_OUT_DTL,
      PROJECT_FUNDS_MGMT,                                       ORG_COST_CENTER_100_999,
      ORG_COST_CENTER_EEIC_SUMMARY,                                                         and
      ORG_COST_CENTER_ACCT_SUMMARY. The BASE_CONSTANTS_1 table is
      used to link satellite accounts to host accounts for access to the host-unique table.
      4.50.2.2. The ENTERPRISE_SUPERSCAN table data is derived from eleven separate
      queries and then combined. A unique “RCD” field will be built with each query to aid in
      the sorting and grouping of the data. The complete process (in general terms) is defined
      as follows:
         4.50.2.2.1. Query ‘1’ - the “asterisk” record or the header record. It queries the
         BASE_CONSTANTS_1 record for the HOST_SRAN, HOST_BASE, CSB_SD,
         creates a date from the SYSDATE, creates a program name of “(ACC300) ”, and
         creates a RCD field composed of “^*”.
         4.50.2.2.2. Query ‘2’ - the “zero” record or the base identification data record. It
         queries the BASE_CONSTANTS_1 record for the HOST_SRAN, HOST_BASE,
         CSB_SD, creates a version number of “2.00”, and creates a RCD field composed of
         “^0”.
         4.50.2.2.3. Query ‘3’ - the “1A” record or the “A” set of organizational cost data. It
         queries the SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN, SRAN, and SYS_DESIG linking
         the host base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN and gathering all records by
         HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^1A”.
         4.50.2.2.4. Query ‘4’ - the “1B” record or the “B” set of organizational cost data. It
         queries the SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN, SRAN, and SYS_DESIG linking
         the host base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN and gathering all records by
         HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^1B”.
         4.50.2.2.5. Query ‘5’ - the “1C” record or the “C” set of organizational cost data. It
         queries the SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN, SRAN, and SYS_DESIG linking
         the host base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN and gathering all records by
         HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^1C”.
         4.50.2.2.6. Query ‘6’ - the “1D” record or the “D” set of organizational data. It
         queries the SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN, SRAN, and SYS_DESIG linking
         the host base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN and gathering all records by
         HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^1D”.

          4.50.2.2.7. Query ‘7’ - the “2” record or the “Materiel Support Division Summary”
          data set. It queries the SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN, SRAN, and
          SYS_DESIG linking the host base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN and
          gathering all records by HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^2”.
          The budget code must equal “8” and the first position of the document number must
          be unequal to “U”.
          4.50.2.2.8. Query ‘8’ - the “3” record or the “Consolidated Transaction History
          Register (R72)” data set. It queries the SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN,
          SRAN, and SYS_DESIG linking the host base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN
          and gathering all records by HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^3”.
          4.50.2.2.9. Query ‘9’ - the “4” record or the “Due-out” data set. It queries the
          SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN, SRAN, and SYS_DESIG linking the host
          base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN and gathering all records by
          HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^4”. The due-out detail must be
          firm or have a fiscal year of obligation assigned.
          4.50.2.2.10. Query ‘10’ - the “5” record or the “Due-in From Maintenance (DIFM)”
          data set. It queries the SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN, SRAN, and
          SYS_DESIG linking the host base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN and
          gathering all records by HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^5”.
          The budget code must equal “8” and the first two positions of the ERRCD must equal
          “XD”.
          4.50.2.2.11. Query ‘11’ - the “6” record or the “Repair Cycle NRTS > 0 Cost” data
          set. It queries the SRAN_REF_VW for the HOST_SRAN, SRAN, and SYS_DESIG
          linking the host base with its satellites by the HOST_SRAN and gathering all records
          by HOST_SRAN. It creates a RCD field composed of “^6”. The budget code must
          equal “8” and the first two positions of the ERRCD must equal “XD”.

   4.50.7. Special Instructions.
        4.50.7.1. When selecting positions 8-10 of the MARK FOR field (the SRD) of the ^2
        record , there are times only two digits are selected. The legacy SURGE will right-justify
        the text one time and left-justify the text the next time. The Discoverer script will fill the
        left side with spaces to get a 3-position field. This option provided the least amount of
        data mismatches on this column.
        4.50.7.2. There were instances where the legacy SURGE program did not print the
        MARK FOR or STOCK-NBR-REQUESTED data in the ^3 record even though it exists
        on the transaction history record. The Discoverer script will list these two fields if they
        exist. There was no special code to blank these fields on the legacy SURGE and we
        could not duplicate this “error” in the Discoverer script.
        4.50.7.3. The calculations in the ^5 records for the days difference function can possibly
        have differences when compared to the legacy report. SURGE does not calculate a leap
        year, but counts every year as 365 days. Discoverer (Oracle) calculates the leap year
        automatically, so the days difference calculations will have one more day per leap year
        crossed (Dec 31 of each year). This affects the following calculations:
           4.50.7.3.1. Days difference between the DIFM DATE_OF_LAST_CHANGE and
           requisition date (DOLC Days).
           4.50.7.3.2. Days difference between the document number date and requisition date
           (Status Days).
           4.50.7.3.3. Days difference between the DIFM ISU_DOR_DATE and requisition
           date (ISU Days).
           4.50.7.3.4. Sum of DIFM AWP_DAYS and DOLC Days (AWP Days).
           4.50.7.3.5. ISU Days minus (AWP Days plus DIFM DELAYED_OTHER_DAYS)
           (Charge Days).
        4.50.7.4. The legacy output file is hard-coded to FTP to sites at HQ ACC and
        Montgomery, AL. However, this is beyond the capability of Discoverer so the end user
        (or designated representative) will now be required to process/download this file and FTP
        to another location (if needed).
        4.50.7.5. The FIA-TRANS field is supposed to be three positions long, but at times it is
        only two in the legacy SURGE. The Discoverer version will always reflect 3 positions.
        4.50.7.6. The ISSUE-PRIORITY field is supposed to be 2 positions long, but at times it
        is only 1 in the legacy SURGE. The Discoverer version will always reflect two positions.
        4.50.7.7. The Discoverer script has a format change for the ^Z record. The sum of
        images is in positions 24-29 instead of the legacy format of positions 3-8. The sum of
        images remains the same.
   4.50.8. Sample Report/Letter. Reserved for future use.

4.51. Budget Code 9 Excess Detail Scan (ACC303).
   4.51.1. Purpose. To provide a listing of excess budget code ‘9’ assets for any host-satellite
   account relationship. The program considers all types of adjusted level details during the
   computation to determine what assets (if any) are excess.
   4.51.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_BC__9_EXCESS table
   and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters are
   described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was compiled
   using the following criteria:
       4.51.2.1. The primary table used to build the enterprise table is the ITEM_TABLE.
       Secondary      tables     include     the      ISG_STOCK_NBR_RELATIONSHIP,
       ADJUSTED_LEVEL_DTL,                               MASTER_BENCH_STOCK_DTL,
       SRAN_BASE_CONSTANTS_1_VW, and SPECIAL_CONTROL.
       4.51.2.2. The ENTERPRISE_BC_9_EXCESS table data is derived from four separate
       queries and then combined so that the excess (if it exists) can be properly computed. The
       complete process (in general terms) is defined as follows:
           4.51.2.2.1. Query ‘1’ – provides budget code ‘9’ items with a sum of the minimum
           level detail authorized quantities by SRAN and stock number.
           4.51.2.2.2. Query ‘2’ – provides budget code ‘9’ items with a sum of the maximum
           level detail authorized quantities by SRAN and stock number.
           4.51.2.2.3. Query ‘3’ – provides budget code ‘9’ items with a sum of the fixed level
           detail authorized quantities by SRAN and stock number.
           4.51.2.2.4. Query ‘4’ – provides budget code ‘9’ items with the customer oriented
           leveling technique (COLT)/readiness based level (RBL) detail authorized quantities
           by SRAN and stock number.
           4.51.2.2.5. Once the queries have been completed, the data is combined and the
           requisitioning objective is computed by SRAN and stock number. From there a
           search is made to retrieve the demand levels of all stock numbers (within an
           interchangeable and substitute group (ISG)) coded as the master stock number. The
           ISG information is used in formulas for computing excess for interchangeable stock
           numbers. (Note: The demand level of the master stock number is used as the
           demand level for all interchangeable stock numbers within the same ISG). A final
           query is then applied to gather all the additional information needed to compute the
           excess quantity (if there is any) and populate the report.
       4.51.2.3. Stock numbers that are not coded as budget code ‘9’ are excluded from this
       report.
   4.51.3. Tabs (Also known as sheets and worksheets).
       4.51.3.1. Tab 1 (ACC303).
Condition(s): Selects items based on program logic in Para. 4.48.2. (including sub-paragraphs)
and any additional user-defined parameters. Paging item is the data date taken from the
SPECIAL_CONTROL table.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                           381


Sort(s): Sort by SRAN, system designator, and stock number.
   4.51.4. Computed Fields.
       4.51.4.1. DEMAND LEVEL. This value is the demand level of the master stock number
       (if it exists, is greater than 0, and the stock number being computed for excess is the
       interchangeable) or the demand level of the stock number computed for excess.
       4.51.4.2. REQUISITIONING OBJECTIVE (RO). This value is initially the RO of the
       master stock number (if it exists, is greater than 0, and the stock number being computed
       for excess is the interchangeable) or the demand level of the stock number. It is replaced
       by the minimum level if greater than the demand level of the stock number (or if greater
       than the demand level or RO of the master stock number when the stock number
       computed for excess is the interchangeable). It is also replaced by the maximum level if
       less than the demand level of the stock number (or if less than the demand level or RO of
       the master stock number when the stock number computed for excess is the
       interchangeable, and is greater than 0). It is also replaced by the fixed level (if greater
       than 0) of the stock number (or the fixed level of the master stock number when the stock
       number computed for excess is the interchangeable). (Note: If there is a COLT/RBL
       level, that overrides all conditions listed above.            For stock numbers with a
       master/interchangeable relationship, this level is loaded to the interchangeable but applies
       to both.)
       4.51.4.3. EXCESS. This value is computed by using the formula (serviceable balance –
       RO).
       4.51.4.4. EXCESS$. This value is computed by using the formula ((serviceable balance
       – RO) * unit price * .01)
   4.51.5. Parameters. (Note: Users can either type in their values or select from the provided
   dropdown list.)
       4.51.5.1. Mandatory:

   created weapon system due-out details.
   4.52.2. Program Logic. This program does not require an enterprise table. It scans the
   AFSCDB and builds a listing based on user input parameters. The listing and parameters are
   described in detail in various sections below. The data for this report was compiled using the
   following criteria:
 382                                                  AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


       4.52.2.1. The primary tables used to build   this   report  are   the

           be separated by commas.
       4.52.5.2. Optional: None.
   4.52.6. Data File Formats. None.
   4.52.7. Special Instructions. Unlike the legacy report, the SRAN and transaction date cannot
   be printed in the header of the Discoverer report. However, as a workaround they have been
   listed as the first two data elements.
4.53. Freeze Code Listing (C25).
   4.53.1. Purpose. To provide listings of items frozen for inventory on both the item and the
   war readiness materiel (WRM) records.
   4.53.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_FREEZE_CODE table
   and build several listings based on user input parameters. The listings and parameters are
   described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise table was compiled
   using the following criteria:
       4.53.2.1. The primary tables used to build the enterprise table are the ITEM_TABLE,
       MSK_DTL,                    SPECIAL_SPARES_DTL,                          HPMSK_DTL,

   management personnel, and MAJCOM personnel with a tool to scan the item-detail record
   area looking for item records that have a COLT adjusted stock level (ASL) detail record with
   an authorized quantity of zero. Goal is to correct cases where COLT is not supporting an
   item properly between COLT runs. Additionally, this program performs a routine clean-up
   action by checking for ASLs where the base closure flag is on.
 384                                                   AFH23-123V2PT4          8 AUGUST 2013


   4.54.2. Program Logic. This program does not require an enterprise table. It scans the
   AFSCDB and builds several data files based on user input parameters. The data files and
   parameters are described in detail in various sections below. The data images for this report
   are compiled using the following criteria:
       4.54.2.1. Format XCA Delete transactions on COLT/RBL levels where the stock number
       has the base closure flag on.
       4.54.2.2. Format 1F3D transactions on non COLT/RBL levels where the stock number
       has the base closure flag on.
       4.54.2.3. Format XCA Delete transactions on RBL levels where the stock number has a
       RID of ‘SXX’ (where ‘XX’ is a wildcard).
           4.54.2.3.1. Format XCA Update transactions on COLT levels where the authorized
           quantity equals ‘0’, the item record MIN or MAX or FIX Flag equals ‘1’, the mission
           impact code (MIC) is in (‘0’, ‘1’), the number of demands current is greater than ‘0’,
           and the stockage priority code (SPC) is not in (‘5’, ‘E’, ‘N’).
           4.54.2.3.2. Format XCA Delete transactions on COLT levels where the authorized
           quantity equals ‘0’, the item record MIN or MAX or FIX Flag equals ‘1’, and (MIC
           not in (‘0’, ‘1’) or number of demands current equals ‘0’).
       4.54.2.4. The primary table used to build this report is the ADJUSTED_LEVEL_DTL.
       Secondary tables include the ITEM_TABLE and SRAN_REF_VW.
       4.54.2.5. In general terms, all ASL records meeting the parameter criteria are scanned.
       When the base closure flag is on (set to ‘1’), the program formats the necessary XCA/1F3
       delete images. Remaining ASLs are checked to see if the associated item record has a
       MIC of one or zero and that the number of demands current field is greater than zero.
       For records that meet this condition the program creates a XCA to update the COLT ASL
       authorized quantity to one and LVL input to force releveling. Records not meeting the
       previous condition will then receive an additional check. The program will check to see
       if an approved ASL (type level flag equal to A/B/C/E) with a level justification code
       unequal to zero/G/H is present for the selected stock number. The program will then
       create a XCA to delete the COLT ASL and create a LVL to force releveling.

   4.54.7. Special Instructions.
        4.54.7.1. The legacy COBOL program would automatically send the data file images to
        pseudo for processing. However, that is beyond the capability of Discoverer. Each tab
        must now be downloaded by the user and forwarded for SBSS processing via the pseudo
        to make the desired changes to the database. The sequence of processing the files does
        make a difference. Use the following sequence to ensure that all data files will be
        successfully processed:
           4.54.7.1.1. Process all 1F3D transactions to completion.
           4.54.7.1.2. Process all XCA Delete transactions to completion.
           4.54.7.1.3. Process all XCA Update transactions to completion.
           4.54.7.1.4. Process all LVL transactions to completion.
4.55. Proactive Demand Leveling (PDL).
   4.55.1. Purpose. To provide a program to compute levels for items consisting of no demand
   history or extremely low historical demands. PDL is a tool for Lead Commands and makes
   use of global demand data to proactively lay-in adjusted stock levels (ASL) (or bench stock
   levels) at one base using demand data from other bases that operate the same weapon system.
   The Lead Commands will decide which weapon systems will use PDL and set the criteria for
   determining which items to proactively stock. AFMC will administer the PDL process (run
   the PDL programs and load the PDL levels). For bases that are not supported by AFMC, the
   base’s MAJCOM will coordinate all PDL activities. Proactively setting levels based on
   global demands prevents MICAPs at a cost that is less than the sum of weapon system
   downtime and MICAP backorder costs. This report also provides the user with the
   recommended transaction images to be processed in the SBSS if the stock number is
   approved for PDL.
   4.55.2. Program Logic. This program will scan the ENTERPRISE_PDL table and build
   images for four different SBSS transactions based on user input parameters. The transactions
   and parameters are described in detail in various sections below. The data for the enterprise
   table was compiled using the following criteria:
        4.55.2.1. The primary table used to build the enterprise table is the ITEM_TABLE.
        Secondary tables include the ADJUSTED_LEVEL_DTL, SPECIAL_CONTROL, and
        SRAN_REF_VW.
        4.55.2.2. Budget code for all stock numbers must be equal to ‘9’.
        4.55.2.3. The first position of the ITEM_TABLE.RID field must be equal to ‘S’.

       4.55.2.4. The fifth position of the stock number must be numeric (e.g. no “L” or “P”
       stock numbers will be considered).
       4.55.2.5. The unit price of each stock number must be less than $1,501.
       4.55.2.6. The health hazard flag must be equal to ‘0’ or blank and the issue exception
       code must not equal ‘8’ or ‘9’. (Note: For those proficient with Oracle, NULL values are
       also excluded).
       4.55.2.7. The acquisition advice code must not equal ‘V’ or ‘Y’.
       4.55.2.8. The ASL level justification code must be equal to ‘0’ or the ASL application
       SRAN tasking must be equal to ‘TPROACTVLV%’ (where ‘%’ is a wildcard).
       4.55.2.9. The cumulative recurring demands plus the number of demands current must
       be greater than ‘0’.

         account. An ‘N’ is returned if the stock number is not loaded at the host account and a
         long FIL is then formatted.

                                    DATABASE DESIGN

Section 5A—- Database Design.

5.1. Overall Design.
   5.1.1. All Supply accounts will migrate on a daily basis to a relational AFSCDB. This
   central database consists of a single schema within a single database. The database is
   partitioned by SRAN. Each table consists of table name, column name and data type.
   5.1.2. The table name represents a record name in SBSS today. It consists of the actual
   name of the table, primary key columns, foreign key columns, unique constraint columns, not
   null constraint columns, check constraint columns and triggers.
      5.1.2.1. A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in
      a table. No column that is part of the primary key can contain a null value.
      5.1.2.2. A foreign key is a column or set of columns that establishes a relationship
      between two tables (parent and child).
      5.1.2.3. A unique constraint column requires that every value in a column or set of
      columns contain no duplicate values.
      5.1.2.4. A not null constraint column ensures that null values are not allowed in the
      column.
      5.1.2.5. A check constraint column defines a condition that each row must satisfy.
      5.1.2.6. A trigger is a PL/SQL program that is executed when a certain event such as an
      insert or an update of a column occurs on a table.
   5.1.3. Each column name represents an element name in SBSS today. It consists of the
   name of each column, parent table if applicable, and row information needed for migration
   purposes. Each row represents a record in SBSS today.
   5.1.4. The data type represents the specific type of data, just as it does in SBSS today. There
   are 4 different data types: Date, Varchar2, Char and Number.
      5.1.4.1. Date represents the system date.
      5.1.4.2. Varchar2 represents a variable length character string having a maximum length
      in size.
      5.1.4.3. Char represents a fixed-length character string of a certain amount of characters.
          5.1.4.3.1. Number represents a numeric value.
   5.1.5. The central database will contain 7 types of tables: User Management, General
   Supply Information, Standard Reports Working tables, Migration Working tables, AF level
   (universal), Host SRAN level, and SRAN level.

   5.1.6. Views are added to link SRANs to host information and to simplify SRAN queries.
   All views were mainly built for standard reports processing, not for ad hoc query use, but
   they can be used to satisfy any type of query, report or ad hoc if necessary.
   5.1.7. Partitions are added to simplify the migration process and also for import/export
   purposes in the future. Partitions are separated by Host SRAN and their linked satellites.
   5.1.8. Row level security will be utilized to control user access to information based on
   SRAN.
5.2. User Management Tables.
   5.2.1. User      management        tables      will      include  USER_TABLE and
   USER_SECURITY_TABLE. The information contained in these tables does not exist in
   legacy databases and will be used to control user access to data.
   5.2.2. User Table.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. To store user name and assigned user account information.

   5.6.1. Host SRAN Level tables include BASE CONSTANTS 1, SPECIAL CONTROL,
   LOCAL SRD TABLE, INV CONTROL, SHIPPING DESTINATION, and BASE SUPPLY
   MGMT CONTROL. Host SRAN level tables will contain information controlled by a host
   site but shared with all of its supported sites. Tables of this type will be created to contain
   data from the 001-BASE-CONSTANTS-1, 002-SPECIAL-CONTROL, 008-SRD-RECORD,
   507-INV-ADJUSTMENT-CONTROL, 519-SHIPPING-DESTINATION, and 600-BASE-
   SUPPLY-MGMT-CONTROL transitioned from all legacy databases as part of the daily data
   migration.
   5.6.2. Base Constants 1.
      5.6.2.1. Purpose. To store the constant data unique to each CSB operation. Most
      application and utility programs use these constants. Data in this record must be current
      at all times.
      5.6.2.2. LOGMARS information will be separated from the 001 record and stored in the
      LOGMARS table.
      5.6.2.3. M & S codes information for supplies and equipment will be separated from the
      001 record and stored in the M_AND_S_CODES table.
      5.6.2.4. 001-ADS-IMPLEMENTED-FLAGS                   and    001-ADS-ACTIVE-FLAGS
      information will be separated from the               001 record and stored in the
      SBSS_PROCESS_FLAGS table.

5.8. Views.
   5.8.1. A view represents logical subsets or combinations of data. It actually contains no data
   of its own but is like a window through which data from tables can be viewed or changed. In
   AFSCDB, views are added to link SRANs to host information and to simplify SRAN queries.
   All views were mainly built for standard reports processing, not for ad hoc query use, but
   they can be used to satisfy any type of query, report or ad hoc if necessary.
   5.8.2. All SRD View.
      5.8.2.1. Purpose. To store a view of LOCAL_SRD_TABLE and SRD_TABLE
      information to a host and all of the sites supported by that host.

5.9. Partitions.
   5.9.1. Deleting data from tables as part of the daily migration process takes a significant
   amount of time. As a result, truncation of HOST level and SRAN level tables was chosen as
   the preferred method for removing old data before new data is uploaded.
   5.9.2. Data from all legacy databases is received at various times rather than all at the same
   time. Subsequently, partitioning became a requirement for removing old data and uploading
   new data for each legacy database without affecting data migrations for other legacy
   databases.
   5.9.3. Partitioning by host SRAN was chosen rather than partitioning by individual SRAN.
       5.9.3.1. Partitioning by host SRAN reduces the number of files required and reflects the
       nature in which the data is received from the legacy databases -- a set of data that
       includes data for the host and all of its supported sites.
   5.9.4. Each partition name will follow the naming convention of PART<host SRAN>, where
   <host SRAN> is the SRAN of the host site.
Example: PART5000 indicates a partition for Elmendorf data and for all of the satellites
supported by Elmendorf.
5.10. Row Level Security.
   5.10.1. User access to data will be based on the user ID and SRAN(s) for which the user has
   been granted authority to access.
   5.10.2. Based on this requirement, row level security must be utilized rather than table level
   object permissions for most tables.
   5.10.3. The user security access policy will limit access to a particular user ID for the
   USER_SECURITY_TABLE.
       5.10.3.1. The user may query only those rows in the USER_SECURITY_TABLE that
       contain his or her user ID.
       5.10.3.2. In order to avoid impeding query performance, the USER_SECURITY_VW
       will be created for row level security actions intended for the
       USER_SECURITY_TABLE. This view will be queried by SBSS users vs. querying
       directly against the table itself
       5.10.3.3. The user security access row level security package will be applied to the
       USER_SECURITY_VW.
       5.10.3.4. There will be no SELECT privileges for unauthorized users against the
       USER_SECURITY_TABLE. Authorized users are considered to be those performing
       DBA, administrative, or security duties.
   5.10.4. When querying any SRAN level table, a user assigned only a single SRAN in the
   USER_SECURITY_TABLE will have SELECT access to only those rows for that SRAN.
       5.10.4.1. When querying any SRAN level table, a user assigned all SRANs in the
       USER_SECURITY_TABLE will have unlimited SELECT access to all rows in the table.
       5.10.4.2. The SRAN row level security package will be applied to all SRAN level tables.
AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013                                                           631


   5.10.5. When querying any HOST level table, a user assigned only a single SRAN in the
   USER_SECURITY_TABLE will have SELECT access to only those rows for the host
   SRAN for the assigned SRAN.
      5.10.5.1. When querying any HOST level table, a user assigned all SRANs in the
      USER_SECURITY_TABLE will have unlimited SELECT access to all rows in the table.
      5.10.5.2. The host SRAN row level security package will be applied to all HOST level
      tables.
      5.10.5.3. For users granted access to only a single SRAN, the security package will
      derive the host SRAN for the user’s assigned SRAN if the SRAN assigned to the user is
      not a host SRAN.
   5.10.6. There will be no access limitations for AF level tables; therefore, row level security
   will not be applied to these tables.
   5.10.7. Only those users given an “administrative” or “security officer” role will be given
   access to the user management tables, general administrative tables, and migration working
   tables. This will be accomplished by applying object privileges against the entire table for all
   of these tables.
   5.10.8. Only those users given a “standard reports user” role will be given access to the
   standard reports working tables. This will be accomplished by applying object privileges
   against the entire table for all of these tables.
   5.10.9. Row level security will apply to all views, with the exception of
   USER_SECURITY_VW, by virtue of placement security packages on the base tables for
   those views.
   5.10.10. USER_SECURITY_VW will be given row level security directly and its base
   tables will not be accessed directly by unauthorized users.
      5.10.10.1. No object privileges will be granted to unauthorized users on the
      USER_SECURITY_VW base tables.
      5.10.10.2. Users considered authorized for access to the USER_TABLE and
      USER_SECURITY_TABLE directly include DBAs, SBSS administrators, and security
      officers only.

Section 5B—- SBSS to AFSCDB Cross-Reference.

5.11. DMS Records to AFSCDB Tables.
   5.11.1. The following database mapping table contains DMS record names to the AFSCDB
   equivalent table name. It also contains the data level and migration method. Air Force (AF)
   level tables are maintained and released by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
   only. Host level tables are tables unique to the Host only and are not SRAN specific and are
   migrated daily. SRAN level tables are unique for each SRAN loaded and they are also
   migrated on a daily basis.

                ENTERPRISE SOLUTION- SUPPLY (ES-S) OVERVIEW

6.1. System Overview. Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S) is designed to leverage the services
of the GCSS-AF Integration Framework (IF), commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system
development tools, and custom components to achieve a seamless integration and presentation of
operational materiel management information. ES-S provides role-based security access through
the AF Portal to all (approximately 300) instances of the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS).
ES-S also provides a limited interface to the Stock Control System (SCS), Defense Logistics
Agency’s (DLA) Integrated Data Environment (IDE), Integrated Data Environment Global
Transportation Network Convergence (IGC), and the DoD Supply Discrepancy Reporting
(WebSDR) system. The ES-S user interface (UI) is designed to make over 300 SBSS, SCS, and
DLA accounts look and feel like a single system. Once the user accesses ES-S through the AF
Portal, no further login is required to access operational systems. For ES-S user’s manual:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-LG-IL-ES-
13&Filter=OO-LG-IL-ES
6.2. Functional Capabilities of ES-S. ES-S provides several supply chain management tools
needed to manage Air Force logistics resources until legacy systems are replaced. The supply
chain management tools offered within ES-S can be grouped into six major categories: Data
Visibility, Transaction Processing, Order Management, Shipment Management, Asset
Management, and Asset Redistribution. A short summary of each of these main capabilities
supported by ES-S follows. These capabilities are described in more detail in the ES-S User’s
Manual.
   6.2.1. Data Visibility. ES-S provides the ability to query authoritative systems for near real-
   time views of assets, orders, and shipments. The asset visibility features include the ability to
   query Interchangeability & Substitute Group (I&SG) data and serial number data (when
   applicable).
       6.2.1.1. Asset Visibility. ES-S provides a near real-time unified view of SBSS, SCS, and
       DLA’s Enterprise Business System (EBS) asset data. Data queries are collated into a
       single view that provides unprecedented access to information needed to determine the
       exact location and the availability of assets. The ES-S asset visibility capability also
       provides the engine for the asset sourcing capability needed to manage and fulfill high
       priority orders. See the ES-S User’s Manual Chapter 2 for more information on the asset
       visibility (Query Asset) capability.
          6.2.1.1.1. I&SG Data.       ES-S includes the capability to query and view
          interchangeable and substitute (I&SG) data from the Master Item Identification
          Control System (D043) catalog system; through the Air Force Data Services (AFDS).
          ES-S periodically receives I&SG data from the AFDS (that originated from the D043
          catalog system) and the user is able to query this data by Individual, Subgroup, or
          Master stock number. Chapter 4 of the ES-S User’s Manual contains more
          information on the Query I&SG capability.
          6.2.1.1.2. Serial Number Data. ES-S provides the ability to directly query SBSS
          serial number records that are maintained for items with Serialized Report Codes

         can query one, some, or all SBSS accounts by stock number, stock number and serial
         number, or detail document number. More information on this feature can be found
         in Chapter 6 of the ES-S User’s Manual.
     6.2.1.2. Order Visibility. ES-S provides a near real-time query capability for customer
     orders (due-outs) and requisitions (due-ins). The details and status of orders can be
     obtained directly from the SBSS, SCS, or DLA (as applicable) and retail and wholesale
     data is displayed side by side to provide a complete picture of the order. By combining
     information from base level systems with wholesale systems, managers are able to link
     the requisition to the end use customer requirement. The order visibility component also
     supports the simultaneous initiation of SBSS and SCS legacy system transactions to
     move assets to satisfy priority needs at other bases (a.k.a., the “GET IT” capability
     described in Chapter 11 of the ES-S User’s Manual). See Chapter 5 of the ES-S User’s
     Manual for more information on the Query Order capability.
     6.2.1.3. Shipment Visibility. ES-S provides the ability to directly query the IGC system
     for status of any shipment (serviceable or retrograde supplies, equipment, munitions,
     engines, etc.) by Transportation Control Number (TCN). ES-S is also programmed to
     launch automatic queries every 24 hours for all ES-S high priority orders (MICAP, AWP,
     JCS/Contingency Project Coded, and FSL Project Coded) with status of BA, BH, or
     mode of shipment. When updated shipment information is available from IGC, the
     information will be used to programmatically update ES-S and SBSS order status
     records. Chapter 7 of the ES-S User’s Manual provides more information on the Query
     Shipment (IGC) capability. Several other chapters in the ES-S User’s Manual provide
     more information on the automatic IGC queries.
  6.2.2. Transaction Processing. ES-S supports the processing of legacy transactions against
  all instances of the SBSS, the SCS, and DLA Transaction Services (DLATS). Transactions
  to DLATS can be in either legacy format or the new Defense Logistics Management System
  (DLMS) format. All transactions processed through ES-S are recorded in the Audit Trail
  Component (ATC). ES-S provides a capability to manage all rejects suspended in the SBSS
  (not just those processed through ES-S) and the capability to manage “narrative” rejects
  returned from DLATS back to the SBSS. A new exception requisition processing (A0E/5)
  capability also enables managers to electronically capture and transmit part-numbered
  requisitions.
     6.2.2.1. Processing Transactions. Almost all SBSS and a few SCS legacy transactions
     can be submitted through ES-S using simple web based GUI screens. This transaction
     processing capability allows authorized users to process transactions against one or more
     SBSS accounts without having to sign-on to each account separately (i.e., only a AF
     Portal UserID/password are required). Transaction processing into SCS is currently
     limited to a few standard MILSTRIP transactions (e.g., A0x, AMx, etc.). Transactions
     are processed into the SCS as if they came through standard channels (i.e., DLATS), but
     they are instead processed directly into the SCS instance using message queuing (MQ)
     technology. SCS will respond to ES-S through similar channels. Transactional
     processing to DLATS is limited to passing properly formatted (DLMS or legacy MILS)
     transactions directly into a DLATS queue for processing. The transaction processing
     component also offers the capability to submit transactions in batches to the SBSS(s) for
924                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


      processing or directly to DLATS for distribution. A degraded operations recovery
      feature is available to suspend transaction processing against SBSS accounts that are in a
      Degraded operations Recovery state. Only selected users will be allowed to place a
      DODAAC in/out of a Recovery state. When a DODAAC is in a Recovery state all
      transactions submitted against the DODAAC through ES-S will receive an error
      (advising the user of the situation) unless the user is specifically allowed to process
      transactions during recovery. SBSS/SCS level transactional security is controlled within
      the ES-S application, i.e., preventing users from ever attempting to submit unauthorized
      transactions. The Audit Trail Component of ES-S (ATC) maintains a record that links
      the initiator’s Portal User-ID to the transaction (including the SBSS UserID used to
      process the transaction into the SBSS). See Chapter 28 of the ES-S User’s Manual for
      more information on the Transaction Processing capability. The Batch Processing
      capability is described under Tools in Chapter 27 of the ES-S User’s Manual.
         6.2.2.1.1. DLMS. ES-S supports the conversion of selected legacy MILS (80
         position fixed length military standard) transactions to modern, commercial,
         electronic data interface (EDI) transaction sets as defined in the Defense Logistics
         Management System (DLMS). More information on this feature can be found in
         Chapter 19 of the ES-S User’s Manual.
         6.2.2.1.2. Part Number Requisitions. The Part Number Requisition capability allows
         users to submit selected (exception) part number requisitions and associated
         descriptive data to DLA in a single transaction. This capability is designed to
         eliminate the need to manually send a DD Form 1348-6, Single Line Item Requisition
         System Document, DoD (Manual – Long Form), (or equivalent) to DLA. This is
         possible due to a new modernized DLMS transaction/format that accommodates all
         the exception requisition data, including the descriptive data. DLA’s system is
         DLMS enabled and can readily receive and interpret the requisition transaction. The
         SBSS will send A0E/A05 Requisition transactions to ES-S. Users can select
         A0E/A05 requisitions to manage and enter the descriptive data via an input screen
         modeled after the DD Form 1348-6. Once the user enters the descriptive data the
         information can be sent to DLA in near real-time (via DLATS) in a single DLMS
         transaction. The plan is to apply this capability to additional receiving source
         systems, as they become DLMS enabled. More information on these features can be
         found in Chapter 20 of the ES-S User’s Manual.
      6.2.2.2. Auditing Transactions. All transactions processed through ES-S are recorded in
      the Audit Trail Component (ATC). The ATC is used to record and therefore augments
      the SBSS and SCS legacy system transaction histories. It is important to note that
      transactions are only initiated in ES-S, that is, ES-S does not actually process any
      transactions so the transaction histories on the legacy systems are needed to make up the
      entire audit trail of a transaction. ES-S records both the input (request) and the response
      from the appropriate legacy system. ATC records are periodically migrated to the Air
      Force Data Service (AFDS), however ATC queries will retrieve records from the ES-S
      ATC database and AFDS simultaneously and merge the results for presentation to the
      user. Chapter 3 of the ES-S User’s Manual provides more information on the Query
      Audit Trail capability in ES-S.
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                             925


     6.2.2.3. Managing SBSS Transaction Rejects. ES-S provides a capability to manage all
     rejects suspensed in the SBSS (not just those processed through ES-S). This capability is
     designed to replace the D818 reject management that requires users to sign-on into the
     SBSS in the Demand mode. Users do not need to have direct access to SBSS Demand to
     manage and clear rejects through ES-S, but they do need transaction processing
     privileges to reprocess transactions and the “Clear Rejects” capability assigned to process
     reject clear transactions. Reject records in ES-S are refreshed at select intervals (usually
     about every 4 hours) and or manually by ES-S administrators. See Chapter 24 of the ES-
     S User’s Manual for more information on managing rejects in ES-S.
     6.2.2.4. Managing DLATS Narrative Rejects. ES-S also provides the capability to
     manage “narrative” rejects returned from DLATS back to the SBSS. These narrative
     rejects have always been especially problematic because they are returned to the initiating
     bases in a text file, where they have very little visibility and are often ignored (thus
     delaying logistics support). ES-S receives all DLATS narrative rejects for ALL SBSS
     accounts. This allows managers/users to see all DLATS Narrative rejects in one place;
     facilitates the correction and resubmission of transactions; increases the visibility of these
     rejects so managers can evaluate the scope/impact to their accounts; and allows users to
     perform analysis on the narrative messages to help isolate the true cause (i.e., system or
     procedural problems). Chapter 23 of the ES-S User’s Manual provides more information
     on this feature.
  6.2.3. Order Management. ES-S provides order management capabilities designed to
  optimize global support and management. ES-S provides a consolidated (global) view of all
  active high priority (MICAP, AWP, JCS/Contingency project coded, and FSL project coded)
  orders in a single database. The Requisition Reconciliation capability displays the results of
  an automatic comparison (reconciliation) between base and supplier requisition data.
     6.2.3.1. High Priority Order Management. As the replacement for MASS, ES-S supports
     the near real-time management, sourcing, and monitoring of all SBSS MICAP orders.
     ES-S also extends this capability to support the same intensive management of other high
     priority (AWP, JCS/Contingency project coded, and FSL project coded) orders. Several
     “reports” are provided to assist with the management of high priority orders. For
     example, MICAP orders are categorized based on their status, e.g., new MICAPs will
     show up in a “New” status report that indicates action must be taken to satisfy the
     requirement. As a MICAP order is worked (requisitioned, shipped, etc.), it will be
     recategorized and viewable in applicable status reports. This approach allows managers
     to quickly see how many orders are in each category and what action is necessary to
     ensure needs are satisfied on a timely basis. Users can select the desired order and the
     system will display the order detail information (item record, due-out, due-in,
     events/bullets, etc.) for the order selected. Authorized users can also process selected
     transactions against the orders ( including manually sourcing orders from other SBSS
     accounts). The high priority order records within the ES-S database are periodically
     (automatically) synchronized with the SBSS. More information on this feature can be
     found in Chapter 10 of the ES-S User’s Manual.
         6.2.3.1.1. Lateral Redistribution (“GET IT”). ES-S supports both manual sourcing
         (a.k.a., “GET IT”) and automatic sourcing of high priority orders. The manual
926                                                  AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


         sourcing capability (“GET IT”) is described in Chapter 11 of the ES-S User’s
         Manual.
         6.2.3.1.2. Global Freeze. A Global Freeze feature within ES-S allows selected users
         to temporarily stop all users from using the “GET IT” feature against selected SBSS
         DODAAC(s). All users will still be able to see the asset availability of assets at
         “frozen” DODAACs but the “GET IT” function used to ship assets from accounts
         will be disabled. The Global Freeze also stops the ES-S automatic sourcing feature
         from selecting assets at the “frozen” account. More information on this feature can
         be found in Chapter 18 of the ES-S User’s Manual.
      6.2.3.2. Requisition Reconciliation. The Requisition Reconciliation capability displays
      the results of an automatic comparison (reconciliation) between base and supplier
      requisition data. The component uses daily wholesale supplier (AFMC and DLA) and
      base (SBSS) requisition data feeds from Air Force Data Services (AFDS) to identify and
      reconcile mismatched requisitions between the retail supply and wholesale supplier data
      systems. This process augments the quarterly Material Obligation Validation (MOV)
      process and replaces the similar process conducted by the AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
      Activity. See Chapter 13 of the ES-S User’s Manual for more information on Requisition
      Reconciliation.
  6.2.4. Shipment Management. ES-S provides capabilities to better track base level inbound
  and outbound shipments.      This includes serialized tracking, shipment destination
  management, and supply discrepancy reporting.
      6.2.4.1. Inbound Shipments. The Inbound Shipment Tracking capability within ES-S
      automates a large portion of the Tracer Action Required (TAR) process by
      programmatically identifying and managing late inbound serviceable shipments up to two
      weeks earlier than SBSS TAR program. ES-S creates and maintains internal shipment
      tracking records based upon existing delivery time standards. ES-S automatically queries
      the IGC system to determine if updated shipment status exists on each late inbound
      serviceable shipment identified. When updated status is obtained, ES-S generates
      shipment status (AS1) transactions to update the SBSS. Additionally, ES-S generates
      specific late inbound shipment reports that prompt the user (role-based) to select
      appropriate actions to resolve late inbound shipments. Subsequently, ES-S automatically
      produces and transmits all required transactions (TAR/AS1/AE1/SPR/1GP/REC/FFC)
      required for updating ES-S late inbound shipment and associated SBSS records. This
      capability is designed to eventually replace the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation
      (NGV597) program, however, NGV597 must still be processed until further notice.
      Chapter 16 of the ES-S User’s Manual covers the Manage Shipments – Late Inbound
      Shipments capability in more depth.
      6.2.4.2. Outbound Shipments. The Manage Outbound Shipments capability within ES-S
      allows users to track outbound shipments (from the SBSS) to ensure timely delivery to
      the destination and initiate management action to follow-up on late shipment deliveries.
      ES-S uses SBSS data from the Air Force Supply Centralized Database (AFSCDB) as the
      baseline for creating materiel management outbound shipment records and then obtains
      destination receipt data for verifying timely delivery of the base shipments. Shipments
      that exceed time standards are identified on new ES-S reports. When applicable, serial
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                          927


     numbers are also included on these reports. This capability also utilizes the IGC interface
     to automatically provide managers with current shipment information/status for
     delinquent or late shipments. See Chapter 17 of the ES-S User’s Manual for more
     information on this capability.
     6.2.4.3. Supply Discrepancy Reports. The ES-S Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR)
     capability automates the management of SDRs at the base (SBSS) level. This capability
     also automates the submission of an SDR to the DoD WebSDR system, i.e., the ES-S
     user will no longer have to directly use the DoD WebSDR application to submit SDRs.
     ES-S identifies all discrepant receipt transactions processed within the SBSS (regardless
     of the controlled item identification code (CIIC) or dollar value) and creates SDR
     records. Each SDR record will be identified as mandatory (based on CIIC or dollar
     value) or optional. The program compiles a list of these SDR records and presents them
     to the user for review and action. No SDR transactions are automatically sent to
     WebSDR, that is, the user must review and initiate the action. The SDR capability also
     receives and processes responses from the DoD WebSDR system. If a response is not
     received within established time frames the system will automatically perform the first
     follow-up and supports the management of records that require manual follow-ups.
     Chapter 14 of the ES-S User’s Manual covers the procedures for operation of the Manage
     SDR function.
     6.2.4.4. Shipment Destination Management. The Shipping Destination Management
     capability in ES-S allows users to view and manage all the Shipment Destination (519)
     records stored in the SBSS. This new capability is designed to eliminate the need for
     SBSS users to schedule and process the SHIPPING DESTINATION RECORD
     CLEANUP (NGV586) program. The SBSS screens FRDR and FRD4 are no longer
     necessary due to eliminating the need for NGV586. The FRD1/2/3 ES-S screens are still
     necessary but combined into one screen (for user interface purposes only). The new FRD
     input screen will be used to maintain Shipping Destination Records. Input to the new
     FRD screen will programmatically generate FRD1, FRD2, and FRD3 transactions (as
     applicable) to the SBSS. A new Shipment Destination Record inquiry is also available
     on the FRD screen. Chapter 15 of the ES-S User’s Manual covers the Manage Shipment
     Destination Addresses capability in more depth.
  6.2.5. Asset Management. ES-S provides a replacement for the Standard Asset Tracking
  System (SATS) and offers users the ability to manage warehouse validations, inventories,
  and print bin labels via ES-S versus the dated legacy capability in the SBSS.
     6.2.5.1. Automated Information Technology.              ES-S v3.2 (Asset Management)
     incorporates the tracking and Automated Input Technology (AIT) capabilities of the
     Standard Asset Tracking System (SATS). ES-S provides an enterprise asset tracking
     capability that replaces the base level client/server architecture of SATS. The Handheld
     Terminal (HHT) application and HHT synchronization with ES-S will be provided by the
     Enterprise Data Collection Layer (EDCL), which is a service of the GCSS-AF
     framework. The EDCL functions as the enterprise “SATS Server” that will provide an
     enterprise view of assets as they move through the warehouse to the shelf or delivery to a
     customer.
928                                                    AFH23-123V2PT4         8 AUGUST 2013


      6.2.5.2. Inventory Counts. The ES-S Inventory Management capability replaces the
      persistent green screen inventory capability that currently exists in the SBSS. Users must
      still initiate inventories through the Remote Processing Station. However, once the
      inventory parameter is established, the user will be able to use ES-S to work active
      inventories. This new Inventory capability allows the user to print the products required
      to conduct the inventory count, enter and process the counts and recounts, determine
      inventory counts requiring additional research, enter comments, process Inventory
      Adjustments, and obtain an Inventory Completion Notice. Note: This Inventory
      Management capability does not yet interact with the Hand Held Terminals (HHT). The
      requirement to enable this Automated Information Technology (AIT) interaction is still
      unfunded. Chapter 25 of the ES-S User’s Manual provides more information on the
      Manage Warehouse – Inventory Management capability.
      6.2.5.3. Warehouse Locations/Validations. The Warehouse Location and Validation
      Management capability within ES-S allows users to validate SBSS warehouse location
      records. This process is designed to eliminate the need for SBSS users to schedule and
      process the Warehouse Location Validation program (R36/NGV835). By eliminating the
      need for NGV835, the user no longer needs to use SBSS screens 1WL and 2WL to
      conduct warehouse validations. The ES-S FCS screen will be used (as needed) to
      update/delete warehouse locations. A capability to print PDF-formatted bin labels on any
      printer loaded with bin label stock or sheets is also included. See Chapter 26 of the ES-S
      User’s Manual for more information on the Manage Warehouse Locations/Validations
      (including bin labels) capability.
      6.2.5.4. Centralized Repair Facility (CRF). The ES-S capability to manage CRFs
      supports changes made by HQ AFMC to extend EXPRESS to manage repair actions at
      SBSS CRFs. This capability works with the EXPRESS Web Toolkit (EWT) to update
      applicable SBSS records to support CRF repair destinations and repair inductions. The
      Repair Destinations capability uses a daily EXPRESS data file to update SBSS reparable
      shipment destinations to indicate which forward bases are supported by which CRF, for
      what items. If these updates are not correctly reflected in the SBSS, bases will ship their
      reparable carcasses to the wrong enterprise repair locations. The Repair Induction
      capability uses a daily EXPRESS file containing the repair induction list for CRFs. ES-S
      will use this list to automatically induct unserviceable reparables (using MSI
      transactions) into the CRF for repair. See Chapter 8 of the ES-S User’s Manual for more
      information on the Manage CRF capabilities.
  6.2.6. Asset Redistribution. ES-S implements a new capability to efficiently identify and
  redistribute excess equipment consistent with competing enterprise equipment priorities.
  Also implements a capability to process Redistribution Orders (RDO) directly through ES-S
  to more effectively determine and communicate shipment or denial action.
      6.2.6.1. Excess Equipment Redistribution. The Excess Equipment Redistribution
      capability within ES-S matches excess equipment assets to requirements and allows users
      (role-based) to direct redistribution. Air Force Data Services (AFDS) provides the excess
      asset and Memo due-out data through an interface with ES-S. The Asset Distribution
      List (ADL) from Equipment Requirements System (ERS) provides the requirements data.
      ES-S matches excess assets to unfilled requirements and presents the user a view of
      recommended matches (asset linked to requisition). The user has the option not to accept
AFH23-123V2PT4       8 AUGUST 2013                                                           929


     the match and process the asset to another requisition based on operational needs at the
     time. When the user makes a decision to redistribute an asset, ES-S presents the
     appropriate transaction screens to the user in chronological order of processing. The user
     validates the data populated in the screens and submits the transactions to the applicable
     SBSS accounts for processing. ES-S automatically performs a final check to validate the
     requisition is still viable and asset is still available before allowing the transactions to
     process. Equipment Redistribution Reports are available and used to verify the
     effectiveness of the redistribution functionality. See Chapter 9 of the ES-S User’s
     Manual for more information on the Manage Excess Equipment Redistribution
     capabilities.
     6.2.6.2. Redistribution Orders. The Redistribution Order (RDO) capability within ES-S
     is designed to intercept RDO transactions (A2A/A21/BF7) that normally flow from Air
     Force Inventory Control Points (ICP) through DLATS to SBSS accounts. ES-S
     processes the A2A/A21/BF7 transactions and either acknowledges or denies them based
     on ES-S automatic sourcing asset release rules. The automatic sourcing logic within ES-
     S compares the priority of the RDO transaction to the assets available and directs
     shipment or denial appropriately. ES-S creates an Audit Trail entry for each RDO
     transaction processed through ES-S and for all the appropriate transactions that are
     created within ES-S. The capability includes several “reports” to assist with the
     management of problems associated with RDOs. For example, users can create a list of
     all RDO suspense details from any SBSS account (based on AFSCDB data), list rejects
     associated with RDOs, determine if RDO rejects were cleared without reprocessing
     (assuming the clear was processed through ES-S), and also determine if a shipment was
     reverse posted. Chapter 22 of the ES-S User’s Manual provides more information on this
     feature.
     6.2.6.3. Automatic Lateral Support. ES-S’s Automatic Sourcing feature uses complex
     sourcing rules and near-real time asset and requirements data from source systems
     (SBSS, SCS, and EBS) to automatically determine the best enterprise source for
     fulfillment of requisitions. Once the best source is determined the system will create the
     appropriate legacy system transactions to initiate the movement of the asset(s) from the
     selected source. The capability includes a direct transaction interface to the Defense
     Automatic Addressing System (DLATS) for the routing of orders for non-AFMC-
     managed items that are not automatically sourced from alternate locations. The
     automatic sourcing capability is flexible enough to suspend/start automatic sourcing as
     needed (e.g., for a specific stock number, base, etc.). Another sourcing feature of ES-S is
     an automated “reverse sourcing” feature that reacts to the introduction of assets into any
     SBSS account. Whenever assets become available, the reverse sourcing feature scans
     existing needs (backordered requisitions) to determine whether the assets should be
     redirected to satisfy higher priority needs. The reverse sourcing feature is designed to use
     Spares Priority Release (SPRS) logic to determine which enterprise backorders should be
     fulfilled in cases where there are competing requirements for available assets. Assets that
     cannot be released automatically will be written to an “Unused” Asset report for manual
     review. More information about these features and Automatic Sourcing in general is
     available in Chapter 12 of the ES-S User’s Manual.

  6.2.7. ES-S System Change Release Documents. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
  Activity announces changes to the ES-S System (including the availability of new
  functionality) using the Rapid Communication (RAPCOM) method and by posting ES-S
  System Change Release Documents to the ES-S Community of Practice (CoP) on the AF
  Knowledge Now. Users can stay abreast of system changes by monitoring RAPCOMs on
  the SBSS Operations Support CoP and the ES-S CoP.
