    2.8. Unit Commanders and First Sergeants. Unit commanders and first sergeants maintain
    good order and discipline and ensure the safety and security of the Misawa AB community.

    instruction, partner with MCAP and service agencies to develop the appropriate response for
    misconduct, and monitor completion of the required actions.
    2.9. Advisory positions. 35 FW/CV may appoint one or more individuals who have an
    interest in any case to sit as an advisory board during any hearing the CMA has directed.

35FWI51-901 24 MAY 2010                                                                        5


3. MCAP Procedures.
  3.1. The MCAP Manager reviews the daily Security Forces blotter for any acts of civilian
  misconduct and obtains appropriate incident reports. Civilian misconduct referred through
  other means may be considered by the MCAP with the concurrence of the SJA. The MCAP
  Manager will establish and maintain a case file on all alleged offenders involved in
  misconduct.
     3.1.1. If the MCAP Manager refers an incident of misconduct to the MCAP, the MCAP
     Manager will notify the alleged offender’s sponsor or the alleged offender of his or her
     options. The MCAP Manager need not personally serve the notice, but rather may
     request assistance from other agencies. Before referring an incident to the MCAP, the
     MCAP Manager will carefully consider alternate processes that are ongoing to address
     the misconduct and will coordinate, upon SJA advice, with the Civilian Personnel Office,
     35th Contracting Squadron, DoDDS, and Family Advocacy as appropriate.3.1.2.1. The
     MCAP Manager will inform the alleged offender or the alleged offender’s sponsor that
     the alleged offender may admit the allegation, contest the allegation, present documents
     and propose witnesses to clarify factual matters, present information on the mitigation of
     damages or restitution, and suggest what proposed corrective action, if any, should occur.
     The alleged offender may request an opportunity to present this information personally to
     the CMA; however, there is no right to a hearing. (Attachment 3 or Attachment 4).
         3.1.1.1. Before responding, the alleged offender may request, but will not necessarily
         be granted, relevant law enforcement or other records. Records requests will be
         processed in accordance with the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act
         (FOIA), and other applicable regulations.
            3.1.1.1.1. Copies of Security Forces’ incident reports and blotter entries may be
            requested by contacting the Misawa AB Chief of Security Forces or the Air Force
            Office of Security Forces.
            3.1.1.1.2. Copies of reports of investigation from the Air Force Office of Special
            Investigations may be requested by contacting the Chief, Freedom of
            Information/Privacy Acts Release Branch (DADF), HQ Air Force Office of
            Special Investigations, Bolling AFB, DC 20332.
            3.1.1.1.3. In order to ensure timely and fair resolution of cases, the MCAP
            Manager may release records that are relevant and necessary for a full
            development of the facts without referral to the FOIA office with SJA approval.
         3.1.1.2. If a response or proposal of appropriate disposition is submitted by a military
         member or Department of Defense civilian employee, it shall be completed in the
         official Air Force memorandum format. The reply should be provided to the MCAP
         Manager no later than three duty days after the date of the notification. The MCAP
         Manager may extend or shorten the reply time, with SJA concurrence, if special
         circumstances so warrant.
     3.1.2. The MCAP Manager may compile relevant background information to assist the
     CMA in making an informed decision on an incident of misconduct. This may include
     conducting an installation and DoDDS record check, as well as making efforts to arrange
     assistance for the alleged offender and his or her family.
6                                                                  35FWI51-901 24 MAY 2010


       3.1.3. Upon receiving a response from the alleged offender, the MCAP Manager will
       provide the CMA with a complete case file including any incident reports, witness
       statements, DoDDS disciplinary records, and any responses provided. If the CMA
       requires additional information or assistance from the MCAP Manager, the CMA will
       coordinate with the SJA.
    3.2. The CMA may direct a hearing if it would be helpful in evaluating the facts and
    assessing appropriate corrective action.
       3.2.1. The CMA may order military members to appear as witnesses.
       3.2.2. The CMA may extend an invitation for non-military individuals to appear.
       3.2.3. The alleged offender or the alleged offender’s sponsor may ask individuals to
       attend the hearing. However, the hearing is not public; attendance is at the discretion of
       the CMA and 35 FW/CV.
       3.2.4. The CMA or 35 FW/CV may invite a command representative to attend the
       hearing.
       3.2.5. If the alleged offender or the alleged offender’s sponsor is a member of a
       collective bargaining unit, that individual may request assistance IAW the collective
       bargaining agreement.
    3.3. After the CMA has reviewed all the information presented, the CMA determines
    whether the individual engaged in misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence.
       3.3.1. If the CMA concludes that the allegation is not substantiated, the MCAP case will
       be closed. The alleged offender, the alleged offender’s sponsor, and the sponsor’s unit
       will be informed of the decision.
       3.3.2. In weighing the evidence, the CMA may consider all sources of information. The
       CMA gives the evidence its due weight considering the reliability and credibility of the
       source, the probability or improbability of the evidence, and his or her understanding of
       the ways of the world.
    3.4. If the CMA determines the individual committed an act of misconduct, the CMA will
    use the corrective action matrix as a baseline from which to determine what corrective action,
    if any, shall be given (Attachment 2). The CMA may vary from the matrix upon
    consideration of factors in aggravation and mitigation and with the advice of the SJA. In
    cases involving civilian employees or contractors, the SJA will consult with the Civilian
    Personnel Office and 35th Contracting Squadron, respectively, to ensure appropriate action.
       3.4.1. Factors in mitigation include, but are not limited to, apologies and restitution.
       Factors in aggravation include, but are not limited to, the unique facts of the misconduct,
       lack of remorse, and failure to take responsibility for wrongdoing.
       3.4.2. The CMA will complete 35 FW Form 138, Misconduct Decision Notification
       (Attachment 5). The MCAP Manager will ensure delivery of the completed form to the
       sponsor and obtain a copy signed by the sponsor for inclusion in the case file. The CMA
       may wish to hold a personal meeting with the offender and the offender’s sponsor to
       convey the decision. Information provided during this meeting shall not be used for
35FWI51-901 24 MAY 2010                                                                          7


       disciplinary purposes. The CMA will determine the appropriate attire for both the
       sponsor and the offender.
       3.4.3. The MCAP Manager will inform the victim, if any, that action has been taken
       against the offender, but will not disclose the details of the action.
       3.4.4. An MCAP determination is not a judicial finding of guilt and should not be treated
       as such for other purposes.
       3.4.5. Failure to meet any specific time standard in this instruction creates no substantive
       rights.
       3.4.6. Nothing in this instruction prevents 35 FW/CC from immediately barring an
       individual IAW appropriate Air Force and DoD regulations. In such cases, barment may
       occur without prior notice to the alleged offender and without CMA review.
4. Possible Corrective Actions.
   4.1. Corrective actions available to the CMA include but are not limited to:
       4.1.1. No action.

 8                                                                 35FWI51-901 24 MAY 2010


     4.2. The actions taken under the MCAP are independent of any other administrative or
     disciplinary procedures.
     4.3. If the offender fails to comply with the corrective actions imposed, the CMA may
     reopen the case and take additional action on both the original misconduct and the failure to
     comply.
5. Barment.
     5.1. The authority to bar an individual from the installation rests solely with 35 FW/CC. If
     the CMA determines barment is the most appropriate action, the CMA will forward a
     recommendation requesting barment (Attachment 6) and a proposed barment letter
     (Attachment 7) to 35 FW/CC through the SJA. The MCAP Manager notifies the unit and
     the sponsor that barment is being considered.
        5.1.1. The CMA shall state reasons for recommending barment. Those reasons may be
        included in the 35 FW Form 138 (Attachment 5) or in any another document.
        5.1.2. The CMA may offer the sponsor the opportunity to submit an early return of
        dependent (ERD) application in lieu of the barment recommendation. If the ERD is
        approved and the offender later returns to Misawa AB during the sponsor’s current
        assignment and any extension to it, the offender will be automatically reconsidered for
        barment without referral to the MCAP.
     5.2. Generally, barment should be recommended only as a last resort. However, it may also
     be appropriate if the offender fails to comply with prior CMA-directed corrective actions.
     5.3. If the CMA has recommended barment to the 35 FW/CC, the offender may not appeal
     until 35 FW/CC makes a final decision on barment and returns the file to the CMA.
     5.4. In the event barment is the only corrective action recommended and the 35 FW/CC
     denies the recommendation, the file will be returned to the CMA for further review and
     appropriate action.
     5.5. If 35 FW/CC bars an offender, the MCAP Manager will place one copy of the barment
     letter in the case file and give one to the sponsor.
     5.6. The MCAP Manager will also ensure a copy of the completed barment package is
     delivered to 35 SFS/SFAR.
6. Community Service Program (CSP).
     6.1. The CMA is responsible for designating appropriate CSP tasks and work sites.
     6.2. Decisions regarding voluntary service should consider the skills of the offender.
     Licensure, background checks, occupational health and safety standards, and other
     considerations apply equally for offenders. The offender’s religious beliefs shall be
     reasonably accommodated.
     6.3. The offender shall complete the Volunteer Services Agreement (VSA) prior to
     performing voluntary services. If the CMA decides a parent must accompany a minor
     dependent, the parent shall also complete the VSA prior to performing voluntary services.
     6.4. The Misawa AB Red Cross Organization shall provide the offender with a volunteer
     service orientation, determine appropriate agency placement, and ensure the VSA is
35FWI51-901 24 MAY 2010                                                                           9


   completed. Completed, signed copies of the VSA will be forwarded to the MCAP Manager
   for inclusion in the case file.
   6.5. Once community service is agreed to, the MCAP Manager and the unit or activity
   receiving the services will ensure adequate supervision is available during CSP tasks.
   6.6. The MCAP Manager, through the first sergeant or unit representative, will monitor and
   ensure compliance with the CSP.
7. Appeals.
   7.1. The offender or the offender’s sponsor will be notified of appellate rights at the time of
   corrective action notification.
   7.2. The offender may appeal the CMA’s decision. Appeals may:
      7.2.1. Address a misunderstanding of the facts.
      7.2.2. Present information previously unknown or other changed circumstances.
      7.2.3. Address factors in extenuation or mitigation that may render the proposed
      disposition difficult or ineffective.
   7.3. Appeals must be filed with the MCAP Manager within five duty days of being informed
   of the decision unless the CMA or 35 FW/CV grants an extension.
   7.4. Appeals will be submitted in writing using the attached format (Attachment 8) and may
   include attachments as deemed appropriate.
   7.5. Upon receipt of the appeal, the MCAP Manager forwards the appeal to the CMA who
   may grant the appeal in full, grant in part, or deny the appeal. If the CMA grants full relief, a
   corrected decision document will be prepared (Attachment 9). If the CMA does not grant
   the appeal in full, the MCAP Manager forwards the appeal to 35 FW/CV as final appellate
   authority.
   7.6. The Appellate Authority may grant the appeal in full, grant in part, or deny the appeal
   (Attachment 9). No further appeals are permitted.
   7.7. The Appellate Authority may grant a request for a personal appearance by the offender,
   but there is no right to an appearance.
   7.8. Corrective action will not be suspended pending an appeal except as determined by the
   CMA or 35 FW/CV.
8. Request for Review.
   8.1. The offender or the offender’s sponsor may submit a request, in writing, for relief from
   any outstanding corrective action no earlier than four months from the date the corrective
   action was imposed.
   8.2. The CMA may grant a request for a personal appearance by the offender, but there is no
   right to an appearance.
   8.3. If a review is granted, consideration during the review may include, but is not limited to,
   the offender’s remorse, restitution, and rehabilitation.
