SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision contains minor changes to this policy directive adding another protected group for
civilian complaints, a one-word change with respect to the implementation of 10 U.S.C. § 1561
as it relates to Commander Directed Investigations in conjunction with civilian employee sexual
harassment complaints, and clarification to more clearly distinguish between complaints made by
civilian employees and military members.
1. It is the policy of the United States Air Force (USAF) to provide equitable treatment and
employment opportunity thereby enhancing unit cohesiveness, military readiness and mission
accomplishment. The USAF is a total force that includes active duty, guard, and reserve military
members and civilian employees.
2. The USAF is a richly diverse community consisting of Airmen with widely varied
backgrounds, beliefs, multi-cultural influences, and many unique life experiences. Airmen are
most effective when they are working in an environment that promotes teamwork, inclusion and
mutual respect. Therefore, we must train and prepare our Airmen (military and civilian) to view
human relation issues and circumstances more broadly. This will allow them to effectively
understand, engage, and defeat any potential adversary or personal situation with intelligence and
integrity.
3. The Equal Opportunity (EO) program proactively engages all Airmen in the pursuit of equal
opportunity. The USAF EO program fosters and supports equal opportunity, the USAF Core
Values, and Airman’s Creed, and must be a founded principle in the day-to-day actions of all
personnel. The USAF will not tolerate unlawful discrimination and unlawful harassment or
reprisal against individuals who engage in protected activity. Airmen must actively make
workplace professionalism a top priority and take proactive steps to prevent, correct, and
eliminate unlawful discriminatory behavior.
4. As we are committed to ensuring all Airmen are treated fairly and free of unlawful
discrimination, the EO program recognizes that military service has certain unique characteristics
and that Congress has exempted military members from numerous labor and civil rights statutes
applicable to civilian employees.Accordingly, all EO guidance will ensure the legally mandated
separate standards and requirements for civilian employment and military equal treatment of
discrimination complaints are met at each stage of adjudication.
5. Consistent with 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 Subpart G, the USAF EO Operations office (AFPC/EO)
will collect, maintain, and post, on the USAF public website, data required to be reported under
the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act (No FEAR Act)
of 2002.
6. The USAF will use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to the maximum extent
practicable and appropriate to resolve complaints and workplace issues at the lowest level and in
the most efficient and effective manner, as prescribed in AFPD 51-12, Alternative Dispute
Resolution, and AFI 51-1201, Alternative Dispute Resolution Processes in Workplace Disputes.
The USAF will continue to train its managers and supervisors in mediation, negotiation, and
other problem-solving techniques.
7. USAF EO offices will advise military and civilian complainants with sexual harassment
complaints that they have a right to an investigation in accordance with Section 591 of the
AFPD36-27 9 APRIL 2012                                                                             3


National Defense Authorization Act as codified at 10 U.S.C. § 1561. The local EO Director will
post and provide the name and contact information of the designated management official
appointed for their base to implement this requirement.
8. The USAF recognizes the essential elements of a model EEO program, as identified in the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Management Directive 715 report.The USAF
also recognizes the elements of DoDD 1350.2, and DoDI 1350.3, Affirmative Action Planning
and Assessment Process respectively in developing model MEO programs. The Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force, Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), the Air Force EEO
Director, along with the USAF EO office (AF/A1Q) will incorporate the best practices of both
programs to establish a model EO program.
9. Unlawful harassment, in any context, is a violation of USAF policy.It is the duty of each
commander, manager, and supervisor to maintain a workplace free of unlawful discrimination
and unlawful harassment, to ensure Airmen under their supervision are aware of this policy, to
ensure Airmen can report violations without fear of reprisal or retaliation, to promptly,
thoroughly and impartially investigate complaints, and to take appropriate corrective action when
a violation is found, including disciplinary action, if warranted.
10. It is against USAF policy for any Airman to unlawfully discriminate, harass, intimidate, or
threaten another military Airman on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.It is
unlawful to discriminate against a civilian Airman based on the above stated categories plus age,
disability, genetic information, reprisal, or any other non-merit factors prohibited by statute,
regulation, or Executive Order.
   10.1. Unlawful harassment includes creating an intimidating, hostile working environment
   for another person on the above stated bases.
   10.2. Unlawful sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual
   favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature particularly when submission to
   such conduct is made directly or indirectly as a term or condition of employment, and/or
   when submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for an employment
   decision affecting the person.
11. It is extremely important that unlawful discrimination or unlawful harassment be reported
immediately. Failure to report, or any undue delay in reporting, may hinder the USAF’s ability to
prevent and/or correct unlawful behavior.
   11.1. Civilian Airmen who believe they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination or
   unlawful harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability,
   genetic information, or reprisal must report it promptly to their supervisor or an EO officer.
   Reports of unlawful discrimination or unlawful harassment made by civilian Airmen will be
   processed in accordance with the DoD Civilian Equal Employment Opportunity Program.
   When requested, the USAF will protect the confidentiality of the individuals bringing
   harassment complaints to the extent possible.

    11.2. Military Airmen who believe they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination or
    unlawful harassment based on race, color, religion, sex (including sexual harassment), or
    national origin should promptly attempt resolution at the lowest possible level. If the
    supervisor is alleged to have engaged in the offending conduct, the report should be made to
    the next level supervisor or an EO officer. Reports of unlawful discrimination or unlawful
    harassment made by military Airmen will be processed in accordance with the DoD Military
    EO Program.
