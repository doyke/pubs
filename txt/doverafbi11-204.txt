SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision includes the addition of C-17 aircraft assigned to Dover AFB. This version also
removes the requirement for QA to provide and maintain sample (canned Form F) DD Form
365-4’s and to recertify the DD Form 365-3 (Chart C) every 180 days and the requirement for
QA to complete the obsolete W&B Airlift CBT. The squadron titled Equipment Maintenance
Squadron (EMS) has been updated to reflect Maintenance Squadron (MXS). This version also
clarifies the duties of AMXS for supplemental books and updates the requirements listed in
Attachment 2 for C-5 PDM input.
1. Quality Assurance (QA).
     1.1. The QA Office will manage and be responsible for the Weight and Balance Program for
     all C-5/C-17 aircraft assigned to the 436th Airlift Wing, Dover AFB, DE.
     1.2. QA will select individuals to be Weight and Balance Program Managers (to be approved
     by the MXG/CC) who will ensure the following:
        1.2.1. Sufficient personnel have completed W&B General CBT and are trained/certified
        weight and balance technicians. They must also be signed off in TBA and tracked on the
        special certification roster.
        1.2.2. Weight and balance inventories are completed prior to first flight IAW applicable
        directives upon return to home station from any ALC or contractor facility where
        extensive maintenance was performed.
        1.2.3. The primary weight and balance handbooks will be maintained in the weight and
        balance office.
        1.2.4. Coordinate all arrangements for acquiring aircraft scales and qualified (certified)
        personnel for an aircraft that requires weighing at home station.
        1.2.5. Track all accomplished aircraft TCTOs and modifications that are determined to
        affect the basic weight and moment. This will be accomplished by developing a
        spreadsheet to ensure weight and balance records are properly documented for all
        aircraft.
        1.2.6. Weight and Balance qualified personnel will post and maintain a certified copy of
        the current (last page) DD Form 365-3 (Chart C) for each assigned aircraft in the
        applicable aircraft supplemental handbook.
        1.2.7. Provide 436 OG/OGV with a certified copy of the most current DD Form 365-3
        (Chart C) for all assigned aircraft. Email Chart C to 436OGOGV@us.af.mil.
     1.3. QA TODO (Technical Order Distribution Officer) will ensure that the Weight and
     Balance Program Manager receives a copy of all TCTOs within 24 hours of receipt.
2. Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D).
     2.1. PS&D will inform and provide the QA TODO of any TCTO changes that affect weight
     and balance of assigned aircraft. This information will include, but is not limited to, a copy
     of the TCTO, the time, date, and location of the initial TCTO briefing.
DOVERAFBI11-204 4 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   3


   2.2. PS&D will inform the Weight and Balance Program Manager when any assigned
   aircraft is scheduled for: Global Reach Improvement Program (GRIP), return, Programmed
   Depot Maintenance (PDM) Input, PDM return, and aircraft transfers, in or out, of Dover
   AFB. This notification is to take place no later than five days prior to any anticipated aircraft
   movement.
3. 436/736 Aircraft Maintenance Squadrons (AMXS).
   3.1. The AMXS Debrief Element will inform QA if weight and balance discrepancies are
   discovered during the debriefing of any C-5/C-17 aircraft assigned to or transiting Dover
   AFB.
   3.2. AMXS will prepare the aircraft if weighing is required. Preparation will include, but is
   not limited to, defueling, servicing of LOX and hydraulic systems, and towing the aircraft to
   an approved hangar. AMXS will also provide at least one crew chief at the aircraft to assist
   during the C-5/C-17 weighing process.
   3.3. AMXS will coordinate aircraft configuration between APS, AMXS (AMES shop), and
   QA for the equipment that will be removed/installed for Depot input/returns.
   3.4. AMXS will immediately inform a QA Weight and Balance Technician when a PDM
   input aircraft has completed its equipment removal prior to departure. This will allow an
   accurate aircraft equipment inventory update, and weight and balance recertification.
   Aircraft configuration will be completed 24 hours prior to scheduled departure. The PDM
   input will be complied with by using the locally developed checklist (see attachment 2).
   3.5. AMXS will complete the entire equipment reconfiguration of a PDM return at least 24
   hours before the aircraft’s next flight. Immediately after the post PDM reconfiguration,
   AMXS will inform a QA Weight and Balance Technician. This will allow an accurate and
   complete aircraft inventory update and weight and balance recertification by QA prior to the
   next flight.
   3.6. Configuration/reconfiguration is considered complete when all aircraft slides, rafts,
   troop compartment seats, dash 21 equipment, and required chains, devices, and straps are
   returned/removed as required.
   3.7. The Aircraft Expediter or Production Superintendent is responsible for informing a QA
   Weight and Balance Technician of any circumstance in which the aircraft’s weight and
   balance could be affected prior to a scheduled flight. An example of this would be removal
   of the forward ramp extension for repairs, and the aircraft is required to fly prior to
   reinstallation.
   3.8. C-5 Weight and Balance supplemental handbook will be located in all assigned aircraft
   in the slot beneath the relief crew table. C-17 Weight and Balance supplemental handbook
   will be located in all assigned aircraft in the Weight and Balance book compartment aft of the
   forward emergency exit.
   3.8.1. AMXS TODO will maintain and update the technical orders and binders associated
   with the aircraft weight and balance supplemental handbook stored on each aircraft.
   3.9. AMXS will procure and install DD Forms 365-4, (Form F blanks) on all C-17 aircraft
   (maintain sufficient amount to accomplish mission).
