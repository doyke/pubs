                   LOAD PL ANNING INSPECTION

       W1

    Preparation and hookup of the vent system will be
    accomplished by qualified shipper or aircraft maintenance
    personnel.
    - ATOC will prearrange for qualified person to vent cargo.
    - RAM P personnel and aircraft loadmasters are not
    qualified to connect cargo to the aircraft exhaust venting
    system.

       N1

    Hazardous cargo that is considered jettisonable shall not
    be positioned forward of non-jettisonable cargo, except
    when its size, w eight, and location will permit jettisoning
    by hand. Hazardous cargo will never be loaded in such a
    manner that would make jettisoning impossible.

       #1

    Loading sequence will be based on aircraft limitations
    and offload sequence. Emergency jettisoning and
    passenger evacuation will be considered during load
    planning.

       #2

    Ensure all w eights, moments, and CGs are accurate.


       #3

    Determine the placement of hazardous materials for
    accessibility, visual inspection, and jettisoning

         Caution: failure to comply with ATTLA
         Certification Letter Instructions may cause
         damage to aircraft or equipment if not

     When ADS links are used, equal length links shall be used
     on each side of the ramp. Damage to the aircraft
     ramp will occur if the ADS links are not configured the
     same on both sides.

     When reconfiguring the ADS Links ensure proper
     engagement of the ADS sensor support bracket spring
     with the sensor support bracket arm. Failure to comply
     could cause improper or no signal from the sensor to the
     ADSC.



     Ensure ramp toe storage handles are engaged


       C2
     Ensure ramp toes are installed in the low position with
     pins properly installed. Ramp toes will not be used when
     loading pallets exceeding 10,355 pounds. Check all
     roller conveyors/guide rails for condition and proper
     installation. If they are not properly installed injury to
     personnel may occur.

                    PALLET PREPARATION AND LOADING
       #1

     Stabilizer Struts must be used in accordance with Table 4B-1.
     Deployment of the loading struts at weights below the charted values
     is at the discretion of the loading team supervisor. Brakes must be set
     when stab struts deployed.
       #2

     Check lock annunciator panels to ensure locks and lips are
     retracted/engaged.

     Ensure opening envelope is clear of personnel, equipment, or
     obstructions prior to operation. Damage to equipment or personnel
     injury may occur
       W2
     Aircraft Brakes must be set prior to any Loading/Off-loading operation.
     Prior to extending struts, visually clear area beneath ramp and
     stabilizer struts to prevent injury to personnel.
       W3
     Do not exceed three broken wires per strand inch or six or more broken
     wires per cable inch.
       C1

     Ensure rail sections are properly configured for mission. Check the
     area for foreign o b j e c t s a n d loose equipment that could interfere
     with rail locking mechanisms and pallet movement. Check all roller
     conveyors and ensure they are properly installed. Damage to
     restraint rails will occur if the rails are not in the full up position.
     Ensure roller tray locktabs are down. Damage to locking tab will occur
     if not in the down position.
       C2

     Gloves will be used when configuring Ramp Toes, Guide Rails, Roller
     conveyors and Rail Systems to prevent hand injury.

        C3

     Set rotary switch to the locks anticipated for use during loading. Care
     must be taken to select the correct locks if there are pallets already
     loaded in the ADS system.

                              WARNING



      When bare tine forklift loading, ramp toe rollers shall
      not be removed while a pallet is positioned over the
      toes. Ramp toe inner roller channels may only be re-
      moved prior to marshaling the forklift into position.




                              CAUTION


     • In the low position the aft end of toes must not be sup-
     ported. Upper tang of ramp toe beam will be fractured.

     • In the low position rolling stock shall not be
     on/offloaded to the ground. End of toes may be fractured.

     • In the high position the aft end of toes must be sup-
     ported. Lower tang of ramp toe beam will be fractured.

     • In the high position the required overlap between ramp
     toe contact pads and floor of loader is 11 inches.

     • In the high position the bottom of toes must not come in
     contact with the ramp step edge or floor on loader.

     • In the high position the toe must not be at an angle
     which causes the aft end of the toe to be above a
     coplanar position with the ramp floor.

                               [1] W hen using the ramp as a lifting aid the stab struts should be deployed
                               for weights above 10,355 lbs.

                               [2] Ramp shall be supported by the ADS links when connected.

                               [3] Short or long links do not increase or decrease the weight limitations.

                               [4] W heeled and tracked vehicles over 65,000 lbs must be on/offloaded within
                               8 inches of aircraft centerline.

                               [5] For two axles on the toes, total axle weights shall not exceed 10,355
                               lbs. For 18-foot type VI platforms, this may be increased to 14,500 pounds.

                               [6] W hen loading rolling stock, bridge plates shall be used to bridge the
                               gap between the ramp toes and the K-loader or flatbed truck. Shoring may be
                               required to transition the 4 3/4-inch step-up from the ramp toes to the ramp
                               during on/offloading.

                               [7] W hen loading pallets with a bare tine forklift, one set of inner roller
                               channels may be removed from the ramp toes if the pallet weight does not
                               exceed 8,500 pounds.

                               [8] The same capability exists when ramp pedestal shoring is used.
