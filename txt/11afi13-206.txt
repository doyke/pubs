procedures for requesting and using 11 AF OSA aircraft (C-12) within the Alaskan Theater and
defines terms, identifies approval authority, highlights arctic gear requirements, and establishes
transportation request guidance. This instruction is directive for all 11 AF units requesting OSA
support (and for organizations requesting airlift by other Alaska-based OSA aircraft). It’s not
intended to be a single-source document for procedures contained in other directives or
instructions, but attempts to reference other pertinent directives and instructions, where
appropriate. This publication does not apply to the US Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard
units and members. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
office of primary responsibility using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Official records created as a result of this publication will be maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Records Disposition Schedule, Table 13-8, Rule 22, or other
rules as applicable.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Added
C-12 schedulers and missions with Priority/Urgency/Justification/Category codes of 24 or higher
2                                                                 11AFI13-206 17 JULY 2003


to the operational support airlift validation and scheduling; included the 517th AS
responsibilities; redefined the in transit visibility.
1. Policies. As authorized in PACAFI 13-206, paragraph 3.7.3, the 11 AF/CC has delegated
approval authority to the 611 AOG/CC (designated representative is 611 AOS/AOO) for those
flights which are non-controversial and routine in nature. The 611 AOG/CC also acts as
approval authority for emergency airlift.
2. General Guidance.
    2.1. Passenger and Cargo Movement. All 11 AF units requesting passenger or cargo
    movement aboard OSA aircraft must submit requests to the 11 AF C-12 Airlift Validator.
    Due to varying mission and cost circumstances, Air Force members may travel aboard an
    OSA aircraft operated by the Air Force (C-12), Army (UC-35), or Army National Guard (C-
    12 and C-23). As the 11 AF Validator will make this determination, all requests must flow
    through him/her. Do not go directly to other service validators, as they will re-direct you.
    2.2. Space Required Travel. In accordance with DoD 4515.13R, Chapter 2, only
    authorized travelers with valid travel orders may submit OSA transportation requests. Travel
    requirements for these space required passengers, along with urgent cargo shipments, are the
    primary factors considered when validating and scheduling OSA aircraft.
    2.3. Space Available Travel. Personnel in permissive temporary duty (TDY) or leave
    status, as well as dependents and retirees, may travel aboard already-scheduled OSA aircraft
    on a space available basis. These categories of passengers do not receive consideration when
    validating or scheduling OSA missions. Space available passenger matters are handled
    through the local AMC passenger terminal (or base operations in its absence). NOTE: The
    passenger terminal or base operations must coordinate with the 517 AS/CXII or the aircrew
    prior to manifesting space available passengers aboard OSA missions.
    2.4. Spouse Travel. Detailed rules and procedures for space required spouse travel are
    found in AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement. Requests for spouse travel must show there is
    an unquestionably official function in which the spouse/family member is actually to
    participate in an official capacity or it is deemed in the national interest because of
    diplomatic or public relations benefit the country. Approval authority for spouse travel for
    all members assigned within the 11 AF area of responsibility, to include the 11 AF/CC, is the
    PACAF/CC (or PACAF/CV in his/her absence). Approval authority for spouse travel for all
    members assigned to Alaskan Command (ALCOM) is ALCOM/CC.
3. Submitting OSA Airlift Requests.
    3.1. The 11 AF units desiring OSA airlift support will submit requests to 611 AOS/AOO
    using the DD Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request, which can be found on the
    Air Force forms website, as well as the 611 AOS public and intranet sites. Because of
    required signatures, the form must be hand-delivered or faxed (e-mails and telephonic
    requests cannot be accepted). Refer to paragraph 7 for OSA aircraft supporting Operation
    NOBLE EAGLE exercises.
    3.2. Complete instructions for completing the DD Form 2768 can be found on the 611 AOS
    public and intranet websites. Specific questions with its completion may be referred to the
    C-12 Validator at DSN 317-552-1912.
11AFI13-206 17 JULY 2003                                                                          3


   3.3. Deliver (HQ 11 AF, Suite 222) or fax (DSN 317-552-3978) the completed DD Form
   2768, and all applicable support documents (Invitational Travel Order’s, DD Form 1381’s,
   shipper’s declarations for hazardous cargo, and so forth) to the attention of the C-12 Airlift
   Validator.
   3.4. Transportation requests should be submitted as early as possible. Timing of a request is
   directly related to the probability of support. Transportation requests should be submitted no
   later than eight calendar days prior to date of travel. Requests received within 8 days receive
   the lowest priority and are supported on a first-come, first-served basis (unless extenuating
   mission circumstances exist).
4. OSA Validation and Scheduling.
   4.1. Once a properly completed airlift request is received, the validator will staff the request
   in accordance with current DOD, PACAF, and local directives.
      4.1.1. Considerations of mission description, airlift costs, and aircrew training are made
      prior to validating.
      4.1.2. The validator assigns a Priority/Urgency/Justification/Category (PUJC) code for
      each valid travel request using the Priority/Urgency system outlined in PACAFI 13-206,
      Chapter 7, Priority, Urgency, Justification, and Category Codes.
          4.1.2.1. Once a transportation request is prioritized, only the validator can adjust its
          priority. C-12 mission schedulers do not have authority to change a priority without
          validator concurrence.
          4.1.2.2. Missions with PUJC codes of 24 or higher are considered emergency airlift
          support. These missions include, but are not limited to, support for inoperative
          radar/navaid equipment at remote sites, first response to environmental spills, and
          delivery of critical parts/personnel to repair inoperative fighter aircraft.
   4.2. If the airlift request is validated and prioritized, the request is transmitted to the 517
   AS/CXII for scheduling. They will advise the user of support or non-support (based on airlift
   availability) as early as possible, but not later than 24 duty hours prior to travel date. Status
   of airlift requests can be directed to the C-12 Scheduler by calling DSN 317-551-3095.
      4.2.1. OSA aircraft are not typically available on weekends, holidays, or scheduled unit
      training days unless required to support a request with a PUJC code of 24 or higher.
      4.2.2. Airlift missions will be scheduled only after critical training missions have been
      allocated. Published training may not be canceled to support a routine airlift requirement.
      In an urgent situation, scheduled training may be preempted to support a request with a
      PUJC of 24 or higher. The decision to preempt a scheduled unit-training day will be
      made by the 611 AOG/CC. The validator will inform PACAF/AMOCC of each training
      preemption.
      4.2.3. C-12 schedulers will make every effort to consolidate transportation requests or
      shift aircraft departure times in order to accommodate individual requests in a cost
      effective manner, considering mission requirements and priority of requests.
      4.2.4. Once an OSA transportation request is confirmed, changes to itinerary, mission
      departure times, numbers of passengers, or cargo weight can have a major impact on the
4                                                                  11AFI13-206 17 JULY 2003


       scheduled mission. Requesters must keep late changes to a minimum, as they may result
       in non-support of the mission.
    4.3. If the airlift request is not validated or supported, the user will be informed as to the
    circumstance of why C-12 airlift cannot be used or scheduled. The requester will then be
    referred to the local traffic management flight (TMF) for other travel arrangements.
       4.3.1. The alternate mode for travel to remote Alaska is via charter service. This costly
       transportation service is scheduled through Elmendorf’s TMF, but only after verification
       of C-12 non-support. Users desiring to travel via charter must first obtain a non-
       validation statement from the 11 AF C-12 Validator or a non-support statement from the
       517 AS/CXII Scheduler before Elmendorf TMF can arrange it.
5. The 517 AS Responsibilities. The 517 AS/CXII scheduler will provide the 611 AOS/AOO:
    5.1. The next business day’s flight schedule by 1400 the day prior.
    5.2. A monthly maintenance and airlift forecast one week prior to the operating month.
    Weekly updates to this schedule will be sent out no later than Wednesday of the week prior.
6. Baggage and Cargo Information.
    6.1. Baggage carried aboard OSA aircraft is limited to personal effects. Items not classified
    as personal are considered cargo and must comply with applicable regulations relating to
    packaging, documentation, and manifesting.
    6.2. Because C-12 aircraft are space and weight limited, personal baggage is limited to 30
    pounds per person. Deviations to this limit must be coordinated through the validator when
    submitting the airlift request.
       6.2.1. During winter months (1 October through 15 April), passengers are strongly
       encouraged to wear or carry appropriate arctic clothing in accordance with PACAFI 11-
       301, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program. AFI11-2C-12, Operations Procedures, Vol 3,
       Chapter 10 gives C-12 aircraft commander’s full responsibility to decide whether
       passengers without appropriate arctic gear may fly aboard a C-12 mission. The traveler
       is responsible for pre-coordinating arctic gear requirements with the 517 AS/CXII.
    6.3. For units transporting cargo or excess baggage, the following planning limits may be
    used:
       6.3.1. C-12F – 410 pounds during summer months (May through September) and 340
       pounds during winter months (October through April).
       6.3.2. C-12J – 1,000 pounds during the summer months and 900 pounds during the
       winter months. NOTE: Wintertime weight reductions are required to accommodate
       arctic gear for aircrews.
7. Operation NOBLE EAGLE Missions.
    7.1. OSA aircraft (AF C-12 only) may be scheduled to support Operation NOBLE EAGLE
    (homeland defense) exercises. Requests will originate with 611 ANF/DOZ using the DD
    Form 2768 (even though passengers or cargo may or may not be carried).
11AFI13-206 17 JULY 2003                                                                         5


   7.2. The 611 ANF/DOZ will initiate approval-to-operate through 611 AOG/CC and 3
   OG/CC interaction, along with C-12 Validator input, to ensure serious degradation of other
   missions will not occur.
8. In Transit Visibility (ITV). To assist combatant commanders with visibility of passenger
and cargo information, manifesting agencies are required to utilize an authorized manifesting
system to mechanize this information (that is, cargo movement operations system (CMOS) and
global air transportation execution system (GATES). To aid this effort, the C-12 Validator will
fax the Elmendorf and Eielson AMC Passenger Terminal’s the dedicated passenger listings for
missions transiting these sites. These listings will be faxed one duty day prior to operating date.
9. Reports.
   9.1. The 517 AS/DOXO will provide a monthly recap of mission information for the
   monthly OSA Aircraft Usage Report no later than the 4th business day of each month.
   9.2. The 611 AOS/AOO will prepare and maintain a monthly OSA Aircraft Utilization
   Report in accordance with PACAFI 13-206, Attachment 3, Sample Format, C-12/C-21/UH-
   1N Monthly Utilization Report/PAF-DOT(M)9707, and submit it to HQ PACAF/DOTT no
   later than the 7th day of the month.
10. Information. For questions concerning the 11 AF OSA scheduling, validation, or request
process, contact 611 AOS/AOO at 552-1912 or 552-7384.
