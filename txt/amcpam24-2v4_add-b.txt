This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD.

This pamphlet series enables application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation –
Part III Mobility, Appendix V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-
402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF,
AFRC, ANG and DOD agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets
contained herein, in accordance with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas). AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 4 deals specifically
with aircraft originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation. McDonnell Douglas
Corp. first formed in 1967 after the Douglas Co. (founded 1920) and McDonnell Aircraft Corp.
(originating in 1928) merged. Through the last merger into the Boeing Company in 1997, the
Boeing Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing,
Donald Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of
the date of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet
aircraft alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Addenda. Volume 4 is not separated from each
subsequent addendum, but is published as a ―cover‖ document along with and as an introduction
for each addendum. The same information for Volume 4 essentially gets republished--unchanged
with each Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Quick Reference Tables. All chapter
descriptions for various models are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick
Reference Tables. The information in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated
in the expanded chapters as they are meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum B. Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) DC-10 Series.
The DC-10 Series aircraft are wide body, three engine aircraft, designed for medium to long
range. The DC-10 was the first aircraft developed after the 1967 merger of the McDonnell and
Douglas Aircraft companies. Designed, in part, to be a long range successor to the DC-8, the
DC-10 incorporated improvements in propulsion, aerodynamics, structure, avionics, flight
control systems and environmental compatibility. In total, 446 DC-10 series aircraft were
manufactured, during its production from 1968 until 1989.

The DC-10 Series is said by Boeing to have been developed into six models. However, it is
easier to look at the series in terms of four basic models (the -10, the -15, the -30, and the -40).
These can be further sub-divided into: all-passenger (no model suffix); convertible freighter
("CF"), able to convert to all-passenger or all-cargo modes; and freighters ("F"), for all-cargo.

Series 10. The first in the series, the DC-10-10, first flew in August 1970 and was type-certified
in July 1971. The Series 10 models were designed for service on routes of up to 4,000 statute
miles. The cabin interior, with its broad ceiling, wider than average seats and aisles, debuted with
this model, and became a DC-10 signature item. Other models in this series include the DC-10-
10CF, DC-10-10F, and the MD-10-10F. (This is essentially an upgraded cockpit version, type-
certified in May 2000.) Overall, 131 Series 10 DC-10s were made originally.

Series 30. Actually coming before the Series 15, the DC-10-30 was type-certified in November
1972. The DC-10-30 featured upgraded engines and more fuel capacity than the Series 10s. This
resulted in a corresponding increase in range and weight capacities. Other Series 30 models
include the DC-10-30CF, the DC-10-30ER (for Extended Range), the DC-10-30F, the KC-10A,
and the MD-10-30F. (Like the MD-10-10F, it is an upgraded cockpit version, also type-certified
in May 2000.) This was the most popular in the DC-10 series, with 266 being manufactured.
This includes 60 U.S. Air Force KC-10A Extenders.

Series 15. The only model in the series, the DC-10-15 received type-certification on June 1981.
The DC-10-15 was a conglomeration of the smaller airframe of the DC-10-10 and a de-rated
version of the DC-10-30 engine, and was designed for high altitude, hot climate airfields. Only
seven DC-10-15 models were produced.
AMCPAM24-2V4_ADD-B 8 NOVEMBER 2011                                                         7


Series 40. The DC-10-40 had the highest gross weight capacity of any of the DC-10 Series,
although having slightly less range than the Series 30s. Originally being type-certified a month
before the DC-10-30, it was intended to be designated a Series 20, but was renamed. With only
42 DC-10-40 models produced, it is believed that none are currently flying.

Additional differences in configuration include three, two-wheeled main landing gear on the
Series 30 and 40, versus only two, two-wheeled main landing gear on the Series 10 and 15.

AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 4, Addendum B will focus primarily on the:
DC10-10
DC10-10F (also MD10-10F)
DC10-30
DC10-30F (also MD10-30F)

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An ―X‖ represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an ―X‖ by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A ―?‖ represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An ―!‖ represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 4 Addendum.
