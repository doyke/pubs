AUTHORITY: OPR for this instruction is the 366th Civil Engineer Squadron Commander (366
CES/CC), with operational control vested in their designated functional manager for
environmental issues (366 CES/CEAN) (Chief Conservation). The 366th Operations Support
Squadron Commander (366 OSS/CC), the 266th Range Squadron Commander (266 RANS/CC)
and the 726th Air Control Squadron Commander (726 ACS/CC) are offices of collateral
responsibility.
1. Protection of Natural and Cultural Resources from Vehicular Traffic:
     1.1. Vehicular traffic is restricted to established roads. Two track roads are considered
     established roads.
     1.2. For mission essential off-road travel obtain prior approval, except as provided for in the
     Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP) for MHAFB, Small Arms Range,
     SCAFR, JBR, and Mountain Home Training Range Complex Sites for 366 CES/CED
     operations.
        1.2.1. Requests for off-road travel is made through established channels to 366 CES/CC.
        1.2.2. 366 CES/CC, after consultation with 366 OSS and the Natural/Cultural Resource
        Manager (366 CES/CEAN), is the final approval for off-road travel requests. 366
        CES/CEAN will ask for a legal review from the 366th Fighter Wing Legal Office (366
        FW/JA) when appropriate.
            1.2.2.1. Vehicles considered for off-road usage must be equipped with spark
            arrestors. Vehicles with catalytic converters used for off-road (such as explosive
            ordnance disposal (EOD) vehicles or contractor vehicles) must have heat shields
            installed or the vehicle must have high clearance. Vehicles without spark arrestors
            and heat shields present a high potential for fire danger during off-road use.
            1.2.2.2. Vehicles are required to have a shovel, fire extinguisher and radio during fire
            season. (Note: At no time will any person attempt action that may jeopardize
            personal safety.)
        1.2.3. During approved off-road activities, personnel will be mindful of potential fire
        hazards (e.g., dry conditions, high foliage, etc.), or soft ground conditions (e.g., mud and
        snow, water drainage, etc.) that could cause permanent changes in surface structure.
        Vehicles are prohibited from parking in vegetation that is high enough to contact the
        exhaust system during fire season. Personnel are prohibited from operating vehicles off-
        road in muddy or soft soil conditions.
            1.2.3.1. Avoid such locations and conditions to the maximum extent.
     1.3. Prior approval for off-road vehicular traffic is not necessary in emergency situations
     (e.g., imminent threat to life, limb or the possibility of major equipment damage).
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI32-7003 10 AUGUST 2010                                                         3


      1.3.1. Driver of vehicle involved in the emergency situation will complete an incident
      report and forward to 266 RANS/MCJB (Job Control). Job Control will forward the
      report to 366 CES/CC and 366 CES/CEAN.
          1.3.1.1. At a minimum, the incident report will contain a description of the
          emergency and route taken off established roadway.
          1.3.1.2. 366 CES/CEAN will investigate the incident report and attach comments to
          the original report.
          1.3.1.3. 366 CES/CEAN will maintain a copy of the incident report IAW AFMAN
          33-363 and disposed of IAW AFRIMS RDS from date of incident.
   1.4. Personnel assigned to or attached to MHAFB observing a vehicle being operated in
   violation of this instruction, will immediately contact 266 RANS/MCJB or 366 FW/CP
   (Command Post) to report incident.
      1.4.1. Incident report will contain, at a minimum and if observable, vehicle license plate
      number and state of issue, a description of the vehicle, location of incident and any other
      observed actions (e.g., direction of travel, operator behavior, etc.).
      1.4.2. 266 RANS/MCJB or 366 FW/CP personnel will contact 366 CES/CEAN as soon
      as possible to report incident. (Note: At no time will any person attempt action that may
      jeopardize personal safety.)
2. Protection of the Environment. Protection of the environment during use of range mobile
systems:
   2.1. Permanently established sites approved for use within SCAFR, JBR, or Emitter and No-
   Drop targets by all units assigned or attached to MHAFB, are routinely monitored for
   suitability and operational usability, to include biological and environmental conditions.
   2.2. Personnel occupying permanent sites require training in hazardous material spill
   response procedures not more than 1-year prior to site occupation.
   2.3. Hazardous material spill kits will be present on site during establishment, occupation
   and completion of site.
      2.3.1. Spill kits will contain at a minimum:
          2.3.1.1. Sufficient absorbent materials rated to clean one and one-half times the
          expected quantity of petroleum products at the site.
          2.3.1.2. Four sets of 8-mil nitrile gloves.
          2.3.1.3. Two eye goggles or face shields.

          2.3.1.5. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers of sufficient
          volume to contain and transport contaminated materials to an approved hazardous
          waste facility.
      2.3.2. Spill kits will contain additional response equipment necessary to control, contain
      and remediate other hazardous material that could be released into the environment.

     2.4. Use drip pans under all vehicle engines and equipment at the site that remain stationary
     for more than 24 hours.
        2.4.1. Drip pans will be capable of containing a minimum of one and one-half times the
        quantity of liquid products within the engine.
        2.4.2. Drip pans will be of sufficient construction to prevent release of liquid products to
        the environment.
     2.5. Handle potentially hazardous material released into the environment through established
     procedures. (Note: At no time will any person attempt action that may jeopardize personal
     safety.)
        2.5.1. In the event of a hazardous material spill, personnel discovering spill will
        immediately attempt to stop the spill by shutting it off at its source. If this cannot be
        achieved, they will attempt to contain the spill (e.g., building a dike or dam around
        affected area).
        2.5.2. 266 RANS personnel discovering spill will contact 266 RANS/MCJB, who will
        forward the spill report to 366 CES/CEAN as soon as possible using appropriate radio or
        telephone procedures during normal duty hours. All other personnel will call 366
        CES/CEF (Fire Department) at 828-1117. Make after duty notifications to 366
        CES/CEOS (Customer Service), at 828-2001 or 366 CES/CEF at 828-1117. 366 CES
        will notify 366 FW/CP of spills greater than 25 gallons on any range. However, if the
        spill occurs in an environmentally sensitive area, 366 CES will notify 366 FW/CP of the
        spill regardless of spill size. Provide the following information to 366 CES in the spill
        report:
            2.5.2.1. Name
            2.5.2.2. Location of spill

            2.5.2.6. Rate of substance currently spilling
            2.5.2.7. Time substance spill occurred
            2.5.2.8. Any additional information requested
        2.5.3. Senior ranking member at spill site will assume role of incident commander (IC).
        IC will direct site personnel in clean-up procedures using appropriate on-site spill
        response equipment.
        2.5.4. IC will relinquish command to the response team supervisor upon their arrival on-
        site.
3. Environmental Awareness Training. Accomplish adequate training on the recognition of
and proper stewardship procedures for the following subject matter: cultural resources;
