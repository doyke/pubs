This instruction implements AFMCPD 51-2, Off-Duty Employment. It establishes internal agency proce-
dures for processing requests for approval of off-duty employment required to be submitted by sections
2-206a and 3-306e of DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), authorized by DoD Directive
5500.7, Standards of Conduct. This instruction also delegates to agency designees, commanders, heads of
organizations, and supervisors the authority expressly granted by sections 2-303 and 3-306e of DoD
5500.7-R to require DoD employees under their jurisdiction to report any off-duty employment prior to
engaging in such employment, and to prohibit off-duty employment that will detract from readiness or
pose a security risk. All military and civilian personnel assigned to Air Force Materiel Command
(AFMC) who seek to engage in off-duty employment are required to submit an AF IMT 3902, Applica-
tion and Approval for Off-Duty Employment. AFMC Instruction (AFMCI) 51-201 is a punitive
instruction; military and civilian personnel who fail to comply with this instruction subject themselves to
criminal liability and/or disciplinary action. This instruction does not apply to the Air National Guard or
US Air Force Reserve units and members.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision updates procedures for processing requests regarding off-duty employment.


1. Policy:
   1.1. AFMC personnel, both military and civilian, must not engage in off-duty employment that:
       1.1.1. Is prohibited by statute or regulation;
       1.1.2. Would detract from readiness; or
       1.1.3. Would pose a security risk.
   1.2. Explanation of Terms.
2                                                                AFMCI51-201 15 DECEMBER 2004


       1.2.1. The term "off-duty employment" means business activities and compensated outside
       employment, including self-employment. Examples of self-employment include the sale of insur-
       ance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, cosmetics, household supplies, vitamins, and other goods
       or services.
       1.2.2. The term "readiness" includes the ability of the Air Force to perform its mission in the man-
       ner and at the time and place required, and the ability of a military member or civilian employee to
       perform his or her government duties in the manner and at the time and place required.
    1.3. All civilian and military personnel who intend to perform off-duty employment, including
    employment while on terminal leave, shall submit an AF IMT 3902 to their first-level supervisor at
    least two weeks before beginning employment (except in cases where two-weeks notice is not possi-
    ble). Final approval must be obtained prior to starting off-duty employment. Medical service person-
    nel must comply with the requirements regarding off-duty employment in AFI 44-102, Community
    Health Management, in addition to the requirements of this instruction.
    1.4. A new AF IMT 3902 must be submitted whenever the type of employment or the employer
    changes, the individual's Air Force duties change significantly, or the number of regularly scheduled
    off-duty hours increases. Occasional increases in hours due to situations such as the availability of
    overtime work, or the need to fill in for an absent coworker, do not require resubmission of the AF
    IMT 3902. Previously denied requests may be resubmitted after a change in the individual's Air Force
    duties.
    1.5. Military personnel who fail to comply with the filing requirements of this instruction violate a
    lawful general order which may result in appropriate disciplinary action or criminal liability under
    Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Air Force civilian employees who violate this
    instruction by failing to comply with its filing requirements are subject to appropriate disciplinary
    action without regard to criminal liability.

2. Procedures for Completing AF IMT 3902:
    2.1. The employee completes Section I.
    2.2. The employee's immediate supervisor completes Section II.
    2.3. In cases where the employee is required to file a SF 278, Public Financial Disclosure Report,
    or an OGE Form 450, Confidential Financial Disclosure Report, and where the off-duty employ-
    ment will be with a "prohibited source" as defined in the JER, DoD 5500.7-R, (which includes any
    person or company that does business or seeks to do business with the DoD, regardless of the dollar
    amount of the contract or purchase), the center, wing or organization JA shall complete Section III. In
    other cases, JA review is not required unless requested by the employee's immediate supervisor. How-
    ever, installation commanders may require JA review in all cases (this may be accomplished by letter,
    as opposed to by local supplementation of this instruction).
    2.4. Section IV is completed by the first person in the employee's chain of command or supervision
    who is a commissioned military officer or a civilian GS-12 or above (who may be the same person as
    the immediate supervisor). However, if the employee requesting approval of off-duty employment is
    an officer grade O-7 or above in command, then Sections II and IV are completed by the officer's eth-
    ics counselor. The individuals specified in this paragraph who are authorized to complete Section IV
    of the AF IMT 3902 (other than unit commanders) are considered to be Delegatees of Unit Command-
    ers, for purposes of completing Section IV of the AF IMT 3902.
AFMCI51-201 15 DECEMBER 2004                                                                           3


  2.5. Filing AF IMT 3902. After a request is approved or disapproved, the original request will be
  maintained either by the individual's unit, or in one or more centralized locations (such as a Squadron
  Section Commander's office), or in such manner as the installation commander deems appropriate. In
  cases where the Legal Office coordinated on the AF IMT 3902, a copy of the completed AF IMT 3902
  will be sent to the Legal Office, which will maintain the IMT as required by the Joint Ethics Regula-
  tion, DoD 5500.7-R.
