This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-25, Military Promotion and
Demotion. It provides guidance and policy for the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER),
Senior Airman (SrA) Below-the-Zone (BTZ) promotion program and provides administrative
procedures for the central base board (CBB) and large unit board (LUB). It applies to all eligible
active duty Airman First Class who are assigned to JBER, but does not apply to Air National
Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve unit and members. Compliance with this instruction cannot
be waived. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the office of
primary responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Route the AF Form 847 through the appropriate chain of command. Ensure all

1. Program Objective. To provide exceptionally qualified Airmen First Class (A1C) with a
one-time consideration for promotion to Senior Airman (SrA), to be effective 6 months prior to
the fully-qualified point. Selection opportunity is 15 percent.
 2                                                     673ABWI36-2502 10 DECEMBER 2013


2. Authorities
     2.1. As the Installation Commander, the 673d Air Base Wing Commander (673 ABW/CC) is
     the BTZ CBB authority and is responsible for administering the BTZ program. Commanders
     of large units (seven or more eligible) have selection and promotion authority. Small unit
     commanders (six or less eligible) nominate to the CBB and have promotion authority once
     selections are approved by 673 ABW/CC.
     2.2. Commanders of large units may release the results of the LUB and notify the members
     within their units once they have approved and signed their board minutes. Board minutes
     must then be forwarded to the 673 ABW/CC for signature.
3. Identifying/Verifying Eligibles
     3.1. The 673d Force Support Squadron (673 FSS/FSMPD) will receive a roster within the
     first 10 days of the first processing month (January, April, July, October). The roster
     identifies all A1Cs who meet the time-in-grade (TIG) and time-in-service (TIS) requirements
     regardless of promotion eligibility conditions (that is, on control roster, undergoing Article
     15 punishment, referral enlisted performance report (EPR), and so forth). The Career
     Development Section will verify each individual to ensure they meet TIG and TIS
     requirements for the current quarter.
     3.2. By the third week of the first processing month (see Table 1 below), the Career
     Development Section will provide unit commanders an eligibility listing identifying all who
     meet TIG and TIS requirements for those promotion months. The Career Development
     Section will coordinate the convening date of the CBB with 673 ABW Command Chief
     Master Sergeant (673 ABW/CCC).
     3.3. Unit commanders must consider all eligible Airmen. This includes individuals who are
     on leave, temporary duty (TDY) or who may have an assignment with a report no later than
     date (RNLTD) on the first day of the first processing month or later.

Oct-Nov                        Dec                                 Jan-Mar

4. Quotas
     4.1. Quotas are established at 15 percent of eligible individuals based on TIG and TIS only.
     The Career Development Section determines quotas then distributes quotas to the units.
     Units may not aggregate at the group level. EXAMPLE: Medical Group is divided into six
     units and each unit commander has promotion authority, therefore, they will be considered as
     individual units and cannot be added together to make a large unit (refer AFI 36-2502,
     Airman Promotion/ Demotion Programs, paragraph 2.4.2).
673ABWI36-2502 10 DECEMBER 2013                                                               3


   4.2. Computation. Eligible Airman multiplied by 15 percent equals the quota. EXAMPLE:
   13 Eligible Airman X .15% = 1.95 or 2 BTZ Quotas. Fractions of .5 or more are rounded up.

Table 2. Quota computations and Distribution
 Eligible           Quota               Eligible            Quota
 07-09              01                  37-43               06
 10-16              02                  44-49               07
 17-23              03                  50-56               08
 24-29              04                  57-63               09
 30-36              05                  64-69               10

5. CBB Procedures
   5.1. Small units (squadrons with six or less eligible) can nominate any eligible A1C in their
   unit to meet the CBB. However, it’s imperative commanders nominate ONLY those
   members that are exceptionally qualified and deserving of early promotion. The CBB should
   not be asked to consider average packages. Small units are not required to submit a nominee
   if those eligible are not exceptionally qualified.
   5.2. The CBB will be a two phase board: Phase 1 will be records only; Phase 2 will be a
   face-to-face board, for those nominees whose Phase 1 merit ranking identifies them as a
   strong candidate for promotion.
   5.3. The unit will ensure eligible members verify that their assignment management system
   (AMS) single unit retrieval format (SURF) data is accurate and complete. Individuals are
   responsible for correcting any erroneous data prior to the CBB convening.
   5.4. CBB Phase 1 Nomination Format. Units will provide a maximum of 15 lines (not
   including headings), singled-spaced, on the most current version of the AF Form 1206,
   Nomination for Award. The three headings are:
         5.4.1. LEADERSHIP AND JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTY (9 Bullets).
         5.4.2. SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT (3 Bullets).
         5.4.3. BASE AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT (3 Bullets).
            5.4.3.1. The AF Form 1206, Air Force Fitness Management System (AFFMS)
            history, and AMS SURF must be e-mailed to the 673 FSS/Career Development
            organizational e-mail account.
            5.4.3.2. Each AF Form 1206 may have an acronym key spelling out uncommon
            acronyms used in the bullets.
   5.5. The fitness score will only be used as a quality check before the CBB convenes.
   5.6. Nominees whose merit ranking from Phase 1 identify them as a strong candidate for
   promotion will meet a face-to-face evaluation unless unavailable due to TDY/deployment or
   leave (scheduled prior to board announcement). All absences must be pre-excused/pre-
   approved by 673 ABW/CCC. The number meeting the board will be based on the quota of
 4                                                      673ABWI36-2502 10 DECEMBER 2013


     stripes available (See Table 2) and adding 5 to that total. Every effort should be considered
     to allow a nominee to meet the board including use of video teleconference (VTC), Skype ®,
     and Defense Connect On-line (DCO). Members unable to meet the board will not be
     penalized (that is, their merit ranking will not be lowered); however, they cannot improve
     their position if they are unable to meet the face-to-face board. If 50% or more of the
     members are unavailable, the board will be paper only.
        5.6.1. The 673 FSS/Career Development Section with support from 673 ABW/CCCE,
        will schedule a face-to-face board and ensure units are notified prior to the board
        convening.
        5.6.2. During the Phase 2 board, nominees will be scored on dress and appearance,
        military bearing, communication skills, and AF subject knowledge will be opinioned,
        thought-provoking questions by board members. This is the nominee’s opportunity to
        personally communicate their readiness for promotion to the board members. At the
        conclusion of Phase 2, board members will review the merit ranking from Phase 1 and
        make recommendations for reordering the merit ranking based on Phase 2 board
        appearances. The merit ranking for personnel who were unavailable to meet the board is
        not to be lowered.
     5.7. CBB Composition. The typical CBB will have a board president and 4-6 board
     members. The CBB will consist of the Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM), or a CCM-
     designate, and one CMSgt from 4-6 of the following units: The 673 ABW Staff Agencies,
     673 MSG, 673 MDG, 673 LRG, 673 CEG, 3 MXG, 3 OG, 381 IS, or 715 AMOG. If there is
     not a CMSgt available for a specific group, a SMSgt may act in their stead. The CCM, or
     CCM-designate, will serve as the board president. There must be a board president and at
     least four group representatives for a selection board to be valid. See Table 3 below for
     breakdown.

     5.8. Selection folder: The Career Development Section will build an electronic selection
     folder for each eligible member nominated by their unit commander and forward to the
     selected board members and 673 ABW/CCC no later than 1 week prior to the CBB. The
     nominee’s selection folder will consist of AMS SURF, AFFMS fitness history report and AF
     Form 1206. EPR/Letters Of Evaluation (LOE) will not be considered.
     5.9. Scoring. Board members will score each nominee’s selection folder using “whole-
     person concept” criteria. Board members must distinguish between nominees. No two
     nominees should receive the same score from a board member.
673ABWI36-2502 10 DECEMBER 2013                                                                5


   5.10. Rank Order. Based on computed scores, board members will rank order the nominees.
   The member with highest score is ranked #1.
   5.11. The board recorder will collect the score sheets and add the rank order numbers for
   each nominee. The nominees with the lowest totals are recommended for promotion.
   5.12. In the event of a tie or wide variance in ranking, the board president will direct a
   reevaluation of the tying packages only. If the matter cannot be resolved, the board president
   will break the tie.
   5.13. The board recorder will provide a promotion recommendation letter for 673 ABW
   CC’s approval (see Attachment 2, this instruction). The letter will rank order the nominees
   based upon the allotted quota and will include two alternates.
6. LUB Procedures
   6.1. Large units are squadrons with seven or more eligible Airmen. Large units may select
   15 percent of their eligible individuals for promotion (see Table 2, this instruction). If
   eligible members are not exceptionally qualified for early promotion, unit commanders may
   elect not to use their full quota.
   6.2. The LUB will not be held earlier than the 1st week of the selection month and not later
   than the third week of the selection month. This requirement is imposed to ensure fair,
   equitable, and timely promotion consideration across JBER.
   6.3. The LUB may be a records-only or physical board. Units should strive to hold a face-
   to-face board, unless a majority of nominees are unavailable.
   6.4. Nomination Format: Supervisors will provide a maximum of 15 lines (not including
   headings), singled-spaced, on the most current version of AF Form 1206. The three headings
   are:
      6.4.1. LEADERSHIP AND JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTY.
      6.4.2. SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT.
      6.4.3. BASE AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT.
   6.5. LUB Composition. The LUB will have a board president and 3-4 board members. The
   LUB will consist of the squadron Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) or designee, who will serve
   as board president. All other CMSgts in the unit should be given the opportunity to
   participate in the LUB. The board president may also identify SMSgts, and if necessary,
   stellar MSgts, from the unit as board members to ensure that a wide cross-section of the unit
   is represented. MSgts will only be used as board members if CMSgts or SMSgts are not
   available. CMSgts and SMSgts from other units may be used.
   6.6. BTZ Package. The package will consist of the signed AMS SURF, Air Force Fitness
   Management System (AFFMS) fitness history report and AF Form 1206. EPRs/LOEs will
   not be considered.
   6.7. Scoring, rank ordering and final promotion recommendations will be conducted in the
   same manner as the CBB. See paragraphs 5.7 – 5.11, this instruction. For LUB BTZ
   Promotion Recommendation Letter, (see Attachment 3, this instruction) and for further
   information contact 673 FSS/Career Development.

     6.8. Upon identifying the unit selectees, the unit will then provide Board minutes (see
     Attachment 3, this instruction), AF Form 1206, and signed (digital or ink signature) unit
     roster to the 673 FSS/Career Development e-mail account by the suspense date coordinated
     by the BTZ monitor.
7. Announcing Selection. Results of unit level boards will be released once their board minutes
are signed by their respective commander. Minutes are still required to be signed by 673 ABW/
CC.
8. Information Collections. No information collections are required by this publication.
