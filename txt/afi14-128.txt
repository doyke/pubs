SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been revised to include tiered waiver authorities for unit level compliance
items to depict the assessed risk of non-compliance, removes inspection requirements and
changes the certifying official. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.
1. AF SCC Role. AF SCC is the principal advisor to the AF/A2 staff for all programming,
budgeting, training, personnel, policy, doctrine, governance, and foreign relationships for USAF
cryptologic activities. The AF SCC ensures compliance by all USAF cryptologic activities with
the cryptologic policies, tasking, and technical guidance provided by DoD and the Director,
National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service (DIRNSA/CHCSS).
2. AF SCC Responsibilities. The AF SCC is the service lead for all USAF cryptologic
activities and has management oversight of those elements of the USAF performing cryptologic
functions. This applies to the cryptologic staff of the AF ISR Agency, its subordinate elements,
and cryptologic elements assigned to other AF organizations. The AF ISR Agency Commander
is the AF SCC/CC and principal AF advisor to DIRNSA/CHCSS for USAF cryptologic matters.
The AF SCC maintains an appropriate staff to organize train and equip all cryptologic resources
and activities in the USAF. This staff also provides the management oversight for all USAF
cryptologic activities regardless of program to ensure these activities are compliant with National
and Departmental guidelines, including SIGINT security, training, authorities, accountability of
resources, and oversight.
     2.1. AF SCC will remain current on all guidance and policy documents that are detailed in
     the opening paragraph to ensure USAF cryptologic activities are conducted within
     established parameters. (T-1)
        2.1.1. Execute     AF/A2     responsibilities ensuring    proper    supervision      and
        administrative/technical control of USAF cryptologic intelligence activities, to include
        leading implementation of cryptologic tasking, planning, collection, processing and
        exploitation, analysis dissemination and interoperability between existing and future
        USAF, other Military Department, NSA/CSS, and USSOCOM SIGINT systems;
        seamless connectivity between national and tactical systems; and modernization of
        cryptologic systems. (T-1)
            2.1.1.1. Ensure USAF elements engaged in cryptologic activities comply with the
            Constitution, Federal law, Executive Orders, DoD, and DIRNSA/CHCSS policies and
            guidance. (T-0)
        2.1.2. Command and manage subordinate cryptologic units.        Provide guidance,
        assistance, and management oversight to USAF and ARC elements assigned to other
        commands when engaged in cryptologic activities, to ensure proper application of
        resources, synchronization of cryptologic missions, and compliance with applicable
        guidance.

USAF cryptologic forces to DIRNSA/Chief, Central Security Service (NSA/CSS).

program (NIP) managed by the DIRNSA/Chief, CSS. The CCP funds the worldwide
SIGINT operations—-exploitation of foreign communications and non-communications signals
 12                                                        AFI14-128 28 SEPTEMBER 2010


to satisfy national-level SIGINT requirements for the U.S. Government--and the national-level
operations of the Central Security Service (CSS). Director, National Intelligence (DNI) and the
Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) provide oversight of the CCP.
Cryptologic:—Activities that include Signals Intelligence and Information Assurance
Intelligence Community (IC):—IC members include the Service Intelligence Organizations

Signals Intelligence (SIGINT): A category of intelligence comprising all communications
intelligence, electronics intelligence, and foreign instrumentation signal intelligence,
however transmitted. (JP 1—02)
Tier 0 (T-0)—Determined by respective non-AF authority (e.g., Congress, White House, OSD,
JS). The requirement is external to AF. Requests for waivers must be processed through
command channels to publication OPR for consideration. (AFI 33-360)
Tier 1 (T-1)—Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders or the USAF strongly at risk of
mission or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
T-1 waiver requests may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower
than MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence of the publication's approving official. (AFI 33-
360)
Tier 2 (T-2)—Non-compliance has the potential to create moderate risk of mission or program
degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. Waivers
may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than MAJCOM
Director. (AFI 33-360)
Tier 3 (T-3)—Non-compliance has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or
program degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
Waivers may be granted at the Wing/DRU/FOA/CC level. (AFI 33-360)
United States Signals Intelligence Directive (USSID):—SIGINT policies and procedures for
United States Government departments and agencies to follow when appropriately performing
SIGINT activities in order for the SIGINT mission of the US to be accomplished in the most
efficient and effective manner.
United States SIGINT System (USSS): The unified organization of signals intelligence
activities under the direction of DIRNSA/CHCSS. It consists of the NSA/CSS, the
components of the Military Services and the USCG who are authorized to conduct signals
intelligence, and such other entities authorized by the Secretary of Defense or
DIRNSA/CHCSS to conduct SIGINT activities. (JP 1—02)
