                                           Chapter 1

 CHARACTERIZATION UNIT (CU) & EXPLOITATION UNIT (EU) INTERACTIONS

1.1. General. The 78th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (78 OSS/OSW) provides
and/or arranges for weather support to the Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC),
Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC), 78th Air Base Wing (78 ABW), 116th Air
Control Wing (116 ACW), 461st Air Control Wing (461 ACW), 5th Combat Communications
Group (5 CCG), 339th Flight Test Squadron (339 FLTS), Marine Light Attack Helicopter
Squadron 773 (HMLA-773), subordinate units, and units assigned, attached, or supported by
Robins Air Force Base (AFB). The 78 OSS/OSW is commonly referred to as the Weather Flight
(WF) throughout this document, and is the focal point for all weather-related issues on Robins
AFB. This instruction will be reviewed and revised no greater than biennially or in accordance
with (IAW) host/parent unit procedures if the time is less than biennially.
   1.1.1. The 26th Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS) at Barksdale AFB, LA is
   considered the characterization unit and provides the characterization function for Robins
   AFB. Characterization encompasses the “collect, analyze and predict” weather core
   competencies. Characterization depends on Air Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate
   data, correctly analyze that data, and use the results to produce a coherent picture of the
   present and future state of the air and space environment.
   1.1.2. The WF is considered the exploitation unit. Exploitation is the ability to minimize the
   impact of environmental threats to friendly forces while simultaneously capitalizing on
   environmental conditions that maximize the operational advantage over enemy forces.
   Exploitation units tailor the characterization provided by the characterization unit. Tailoring
   is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific mission profile from the overall
   characterization of the air and space environment. Tailoring does not mean changing the
   characterization. To the greatest extent possible, exploitation units will use the characterized
   data provided to them.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. The 26 OWS at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, provides regional and operational-level
   weather products and information to Air Force and Army units in the Southeast region of the
   Continental United States (CONUS).
   1.2.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). METWATCH is a deliberate, continuous
   process for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The
   purpose of a METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly
   diverge from forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast
   product or group of products, and notify designated agencies. The 26 OWS performs a
   continuous METWATCH for Robins AFB. WF personnel act as the “eyes forward” for the
   26 OWS by providing immediate feedback on current or short-term anticipated changes in
   weather conditions.
   1.2.3. The WF is the primary source of tailored weather services in support of 116 ACW,
   461 ACW, 339 FLTS, HMLA-773, various headquarters elements, and transient aircrews.
 6                                                       ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014


     The WF will make every effort to ensure that mission-limiting weather is anticipated and
     exploited, and that safety and resource protection are maintained.
1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. General responsibilities of the OWS and WF are outlined in AFI 15-128.
        1.3.1.1. The 26 OWS issues the Robins AFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs),
        forecast weather warnings and watches, and may provide flight weather briefings to
        transient aircrews passing through Robins AFB. The OWS will issue observed warnings
        and advisories when the WF is closed.
        1.3.1.2. The WF will issue all observed advisories and warnings when the WF is open.
        1.3.1.3. The WF will create Mission Weather Products (MWPs) that fuse theater scale
        products with local mission requirements to enable the direct inject of weather impacts
        into warfighter planning and/or execution. The WF will also provide flight weather
        briefings for the 116 ACW, 461 ACW, 339 FLTS, HMLA-773, and transient aircrews
        IAW the WF duty priorities listed in Table 1.1
     1.3.2. Robins AFB Installation Data Page. The 26 OWS and Robins WF will coordinate
     and maintain a Robins AFB Installation Data Page detailing TAF specification and
     amendment criteria, WWA thresholds, desired lead times, mission impacts, unit information,
     Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) back-up contacts and local outage back-up information.
     1.3.3. Eyes Forward & Collaboration. The Robins WF will act as the eyes forward for the
     OWS by relaying significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in coded
     meteorological reports to the 26 OWS to assist in forecast operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities. 78 OSS/OSW duty priorities. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, paragraph
1.3.3.1, the WF has created the following duty priorities. Flight personnel will use good
judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially when there is imminent danger to
life and/or property.

14           Weather Functional Training
15           Accomplish Administrative Tasks
1.5. Hours of Operation & Contact Information.
   1.5.1. WF. Airfield and mission services will generally be provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a
   week through the combined support of the Robins WF and 26 OWS. WF services will cease
   based upon the local flying schedule or airfield closure (e.g. holidays/weekends). The WF
   will coordinate any closure with the 26 OWS, and the 26 OWS will continue to perform a
   continuous terminal METWATCH and resource protection support for Robins AFB. Staff
   services are available during normal duty hours or as coordinated.
      1.5.1.1. During times when no flying is scheduled, no significant weather is expected,
      and the automated observing system is functioning properly, the WF Duty Technician
      (DT) will go on standby. The DT will notify the OWS, Robins Tower, Airfield
      Operations, and Robins Command Post when going on standby and will be reachable via
      the standby cell phone at (478)-960-8471.
      1.5.1.2. A web-based aircrew-briefing terminal is located in the Airfield Management
      Operations (AMOPS) flight planning room. This briefing terminal allows aircrews to
      self-brief or schedule a flight weather briefing from the 26 OWS.
   1.5.2. 26 OWS. Hours of operation are 24/7, 365 days a year.
   1.5.3. Contact Information.
      1.5.3.1. WF: (478) 926-3573 / DSN 468-3573
      1.5.3.2. WF Alternate Operating Location (AOL): (478) 926-3814 / DSN 468-3814
      1.5.3.3. PMSV: 349.850 MHz
      1.5.3.4. 26 OWS: (318) 529-2651/2652/2653 / DSN 331-2651/2652/2653

1.6. Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). Continuity of support to the installation is
susceptible to communication outages at the 26 OWS and WF.
     1.6.1. WF COOP and WF Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a
     building evacuation, the WF will move to building 37 (Robins Tower Tower) to continue
     operational support and “eyes forward” support for the 26 OWS. The phone number at this
     location is 468-3814 and a fax is available (468-1775). WF members will follow duty-
     specific SOPs and WF evacuation checklists and resume services at the alternate location as
     soon as possible. Most WF services/support will remain available, but will require a case-by-
     case assessment depending on communication line status, equipment status, etc. If access to
     observing sensing equipment readouts is lost, manual equipment will be used to take
     observations. Expect most services to be somewhat degraded (weather product production,
     pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and the loss of dedicated data services. For flight
     safety reasons, the WF will not evacuate to the alternate operating location during exercises.
     1.6.2. 26 OWS COOP.
        1.6.2.1. For short term outages (up to 72 hours), the WF will assume local TAF and
        weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility.
        1.6.2.2. For long-term outages (greater than 72 hours), the 26 OWS’ plan is to resume all
        support from an alternate location.
        1.6.2.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, the 26 OWS conducts periodic COOP
        exercises.

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions that affect the Robins AFB aerodrome
(defined within 5 statute miles of the airfield) or the base as a whole.
2.2. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations, utilizing the FMQ-19 Automated Observing System, the Joint
Environmental Toolkit (JET), and Air Force Form 3813, Surface Weather Observations. Per
AFMAN 15-111, Robins AFB is an automated station and observations will be taken and
disseminated automatically by the FMQ-19. The Duty Technician will only augment the
automated system to supplement or back-up the FMQ-19. Automated and augmentation
processes are outlined in paragraphs 2.2.6 and 2.2.7 The following types of observations are
created and disseminated:
   2.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). The METAR is a routine scheduled
   observation containing a complete report of wind, visibility, runway visual range, present
   weather and obscurations, sky condition, temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting
   collectively referred to as “the body of the report.” In addition, encoded and/or plain
   language information that elaborates on data in the body of the report may be appended to the
   METAR. METARs are disseminated both locally and longline between H+55 to H+59 past
   the hour.
   2.2.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). The SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted when any of the Robins AFB special criteria listed in
   Attachment 2 have been observed. The SPECI will contain all data elements found in a
   METAR plus additional remarks that elaborate on data in the body of the report. All SPECI
   reports will be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria are
   observed. Attachment 4 contains an example SPECI weather observation.
   2.2.3. Aviation Selected Local Weather Report (LOCAL). LOCAL observations are
   unscheduled observations not meeting SPECI criteria. The WF will only take single element
   LOCALs for altimeter setting changes when the FMQ-19’s pressure sensor is inoperative.
   LOCAL observations are only transmitted to Robins AFB customers.
   2.2.4. Official Observing Points. The location of the FMQ-19 automated observing
   equipment is deemed the official observing point at Robins AFB. During periods of
   augmentation, the observation site is located approximately 275 feet northeast of building
   110. During relocations to the AOL when augmentation is required, the observation point is
   the manhole cover on the east side of the building.
   2.2.5. Observing Point Limitations.
       2.2.5.1. The FMQ-19 sits at a lower elevation than surrounding terrain and fog may pool
       around the sensors making visibility readings unrepresentative.
       2.2.5.2. Augmented observations taken from the observation point northeast of building
       110 do not allow the observer to see the entire aerodrome. Ramp floodlights hamper
       observations at night, and buildings located 1/16 to 3/8 of a mile from the observation
       point obscure the southern and western horizon. The approach end of runway 15 is
10                                                      ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014


     obstructed by a blast fence, buildings, and aircraft parked on the ramp. Lightning may
     not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor visibility. Thunder may not be heard
     because of flight line noise.
     2.2.5.3. Augmented observations taken at the AOL are degraded because the view to the
     south and west is blocked by hangars, buildings, and aircraft.
  2.2.6. Automated FMQ-19 Observation. An automated observation is any observation
  having been evaluated, prepared, and transmitted by an observing system without human
  intervention. In automated mode, the FMQ-19 observing system will record and disseminate
  weather observations. The FMQ-19 uses time averaging of sensor data. In an automated
  observation, sky condition will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 30-minute
  period ending at the actual time of the observation. All other elements evaluated are based
  on sensor data that is within 10 minutes or less of the actual time of the observation.
  2.2.7. Forecaster FMQ-19 Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having a
  certified weather forecaster manually add or edit data to an observation generated by the
  FMQ-19. Weather flight personnel are not required to augment the FMQ-19 when the
  airfield is closed, except when tornadic activity is occurring or forecast to occur. The two
  augmentation processes used are supplementation and back up. The WF reserves the right to
  augment the FMQ-19 based on sound Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles as
  they relate to safety of lives and resources.
     2.2.7.1. Supplementation. Supplementation is the process of manually adding
     meteorological information to an observation generated by the FMQ-19 that is beyond
     the system’s capability to measure and report. For example, the FMQ-19 cannot sense a
     tornado or hail.
     2.2.7.2. Supplementation Procedures. Weather flight personnel will supplement
     observations when the airfield is open and the weather conditions in Table 2.1 are
     observed. The duty technician will be ready to supplement observations if the conditions
     in Table 2.1 are forecast to occur within 1 hour. In addition, weather flight personnel are
     required to log on to the FMQ-19 and be prepared to supplement whenever a watch or
     warning has been issued for tornadic activity.
ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014                                                                 11

issued and snowfall is occurring.)
NOTES:
    1. References for coding of augmentable weather conditions are located in AFMAN 15-111,
        Chapter 13.
    2. The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedent over any other phenomena.
    3. Log on to AMOS and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity anytime a weather
        watch or warning has been issued for the phenomena.
    4. All Remarks and Additive Data references are provided in AFMAN 15-111, Attach. 3.
       2.2.7.3. Backup. Backup is the process of manually providing meteorological data
       and/or dissemination of an FMQ-19 generated observation when the primary automated
       method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
       2.2.7.4. Backup Procedures. In the event of FMQ-19 malfunction or failure, back-up
       procedures will be implemented during airfield operating hours and/or if tornadic activity
       is occurring or forecast to occur. Weather flight personnel will use manual observing
       procedures when performing back-up operations. When backup of the FMQ-19 is
       required, the WF will encode and disseminate METAR and SPECI observations IAW
       AFMAN 15-111, Tables 3.2 and 3.3. All element entries must be observed within 15
       minutes of the actual time of the observation with the exception of wind gusts and
       squalls, which are reported only if they are observed within 10 minutes of the time of the
       observation. When utilizing back-up equipment, all wind and pressure values must be
       estimated. Weather flight leadership has developed ORM-based procedures beyond the
       standard back-up process outlined in AFMAN 15-111, and WF observers are authorized
       to make risk control decisions accordingly.
2.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) Support. The Robins AFB TAF will be produced
and disseminated by the 26 OWS IAW AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and
Responsibilities, AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes, and AFMAN 15-129V1, Air Force
Weather Operations – Characterization, and the Robins AFB Installation Data Page. Terminal
Aerodrome Forecasts are valid for 30 hours, apply to the area within 5 nautical miles of the
Robins AFB Airport Reference Point, and are issued at 0900L, 1700L, and 0100L. TAFs will
generally not be produced when the airfield is closed. Attachment 4 contains examples of the
TAF format.

2.4. Resource Protection (RP) Support & Warnings, Watches and Advisories
(WWA). Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the 26 OWS and
the WF. Watches and warnings provide advance notice of weather events posing a hazard to life
or property. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental
phenomena with the potential to impact operations. The 26 OWS is responsible for issuing all
forecast weather watches, warnings and advisories. The WF acts as the “eyes forward” for the
26 OWS and is responsible for issuing all observed warnings and advisories. However, the WF
can issue any forecast warning if there is an immediate threat to life and/or property. In these
cases, the WF will back-brief the 26 OWS when time permits and will also be responsible for
disseminating the info to locally supported agencies. The goal is to provide the best possible
resource protection to Robins AFB. If the WF is closed, observed advisories and warnings will
be issued by the 26 OWS if they have the capability to remotely monitor the observed advisory
or warning criteria. If the WF is closed, they will keep a forecaster on recall duty for resource
protection actions. Customer responses to WWAs are listed in Attachment 5.
   2.4.1. Special Weather Statements & Significant Weather Messages. Special Weather
   Statements (SWSs) are special notices issued by the 26 OWS to assist military decision
   makers with RP decisions. Significant weather messages are issued by the WF when WF
   leadership believes expected weather conditions warrant an additional level of preparation
   and a “heads up” above and beyond that provided by a watch, warning, or advisory.
   Examples of conditions requiring a WF significant weather message include a widespread
   threat of severe weather or the threat of freezing precipitation and/or snow.
   2.4.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice to installation
   personnel/supported units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to
   pose a hazard to life or property. They are used by installation personnel/supported units to
   make force protection and risk management decisions. Watches are issued for a 5NM radius
   of the Robins AFB runway complex and are defined in Table 2.2

   2.4.3. Weather Warnings. A weather warning is a special notice to installation
   personnel/supported units when an established weather condition of such intensity as to pose
   a hazard to life or property is occurring or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide
   concise information outlining environmental threats and are used by commanders and
   personnel to make RP decisions and take protective action. Warnings are issued for a 5NM
   radius from the center point of the runway and are defined in Table 2.3 Deviations from the
   standard warning criteria and lead times located in AFMAN 15-129V1 are based on Robins
   AFB requirements and have been coordinated with all Robins AFB customers.

Heavy Snow (>1/2 Inch Accumulation in 12 Hours)                          60 minutes
   2.4.4. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only type of observed
   warnings issued for Robins AFB. A lightning warning is not issued until lightning is
   observed, either visually or via the FMQ-19, within a 5NM radius of the Robins AFB runway
   complex. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning is no longer observed
   within 5NM for at least 15 minutes. Exception: A lightning warning will not be cancelled if
   a thunderstorm is within 5NM (as indicated on radar).
   2.4.5. Observed Weather Advisories. Observed weather advisories are special notices sent
   to supported customers alerting them that a predefined weather event, which may impact
   operations, is occurring on Robins AFB. Observed advisories are issued by the WF and
   cancelled as soon as the event is no longer occurring, with the exception of lightning,
   crosswinds, and airframe frost, which must cease to occur for 15 minutes. Observed weather
   advisories can be found in Table 2.4.

Tropical Cyclone within 400NM                                            Observed
NOTE:
1: Issued when crosswind reaches 15 knots and cancelled when crosswind drops below 15
knots for at least 15 consecutive minutes.
2: Issued when there is no precipitation, temperature < 40 °F, dew point < 32 °F and surface
winds < 8 knots and cancelled when these criteria cease being met for 15 consecutive minutes.
3: When issued, flight leadership will produce a Tropical Weather Message.
   2.4.6. Forecast Weather Advisories. Forecast weather advisories are special notices sent to
   supported customers that provide advance notice of a predefined weather event that may
   impact operations. Forecast advisories are issued for a 5NM radius from the center point of
   the Robins AFB runway complex. Forecast advisories, with their desired lead times, are
   contained in Table 2.5

Table 2.5. Forecast Weather Advisories
Criteria                                                                 Desired Lead Time
Freezing Temperatures (< 32°F)                                           4 hours
Winds > 20 Knots but < 35 Knots                                          30 minutes
   2.4.7. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
   consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
   followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
   second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
   Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
   in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
   and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages
   are contained in Attachment 4.
   2.4.8. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from
   35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead
   times specified in Tables 2.3 and 2.5. Only one warning will be in effect at a given time
   (and may include multiple criteria) except for forecast tornado warnings and/or observed
   lightning warnings. Tornado and lightning will be separate warnings. Except tornado and
   lightning warnings, if a warning is issued for one criteria and it becomes necessary to warn
   for another criteria, a new warning and new number will be issued, to include all criteria
   expected. A separate valid time may be specified for each criteria if necessary.
ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014                                                                15


   2.4.9. WWA Amendments. When WWAs requires a change an amendment will be issued.
   2.4.10. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended.
   2.4.11. WWA Cancellation. WWAs are cancelled when the weather phenomena is no
   longer occurring or expected to occur. WWAs not amended or cancelled will automatically
   expire at the end of the valid period. See paragraph 2.4.4 and 2.4.5 for specifics on
   crosswinds, airframe frost and lightning cancellation exceptions.
2.5. Dissemination Process.
   2.5.1. Observations. Observations taken by either the FMQ-19 automated observing system
   or the weather technician are disseminated via JET. When JET is nonoperational, the WF
   will disseminate observations longline through the Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-
   WEBS). If all Robins AFB longline transmission resources are out of service, the WF will
   call via telephone (voice relay) to the 26 OWS to arrange for longline transmission. Locally,
   observations will be relayed by the WF to the following organizations when JET is
   nonoperational (noted on a local dissemination log), in order of priority listed in Table 2.6

Table 2.6. Notification Priority
 1. Robins Tower direct line
 2. Robins Command Post, DSN 497-2612, Comm (478) 327-2612             (As requested)
 3. Airfield Management Operations, DSN 468-2114, Comm (478) 926-2114            (As requested)

       2.5.1.1. All surface observations will be relayed in this format and order:
          2.5.1.1.1. Type of observation/Time (e.g., METAR, SPECI, LOCAL).
          2.5.1.1.2. Sky Condition.
          2.5.1.1.3. Visibility/Present Weather.
          2.5.1.1.4. Temp/Dew Point.
          2.5.1.1.5. Winds (Direction in degrees magnetic and Speed).
          2.5.1.1.6. Altimeter.
          2.5.1.1.7. Remarks.
   2.5.2. TAFs. The 26 OWS disseminates TAFs via JET. If JET is nonoperational, the WF
   will disseminate the information locally if requested. When the TAF is unavailable, Robins
   AFB customers may reference WF-produced products (i.e., the current web-based aviation
   MEF) through the WF homepage.
   2.5.3. Special Weather Statements & Significant Weather Messages. Special Weather
   Statements (SWSs) and significant weather messages provide advance notice of hazardous
   weather conditions that have the potential to affect Robins AFB. The 26 OWS transmits
   SWSs to WF leadership via email. Weather flight leadership forwards SWSs to base leaders.
   Significant weather messages, authored by the WF, are disseminated via e-mail to base
   leaders.

   2.5.4. WWAs. The 26 OWS or WF will issue WWAs via JET. After issuance, the WF will
   give courtesy calls to Robins Tower, Robins Command Post (RCP), and Airfield
   Management Operations (AMOPS) to ensure receipt. These courtesy calls also serve as
   back-up notification when JET is out-of-service. Upon receiving the watch, warning, or
   advisory information, the RCP will disseminate the information through AtHoc (Network
   Centric Emergency Notification System) IAW AFI 10-207 and AFMC Guidance for
   operating AtHoc Installation Warning System (IWS) Alerts. If AtHoc is inoperative, manual
   notification will be accomplished using Command Post weather Quick Reaction Checklists.
       2.5.4.1. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated by the Robins
       Command Post to the base populace via the Giant Voice (GV), allowing members on
       base to be prepared for dangerous weather.
       2.5.4.2. Tornado Warnings. The Robins Command Post has the sole responsibility to
       activate the Giant Voice/base siren when a tornado warning is issued.
2.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The WF and Robins Tower have established a
CWW as required by AFI 13-204V3 and AFMAN 15-111. The CWW is the process for Robins
Tower personnel to report significant weather events or changes in weather conditions to the
Duty Technician (DSN 468-357). CWW responsibilities are outlined in Chapter 4.
   2.6.1. The WF is responsible to develop/maintain a CWW training that includes, but is not
   limited to:
       2.6.1.1. Local weather conditions
       2.6.1.2. PIREP reports
       2.6.1.3. Procedures for Robins Tower personnel to determine prevailing visibility, report
       changes in tower prevailing visibility when less than 4 statute miles and differs from
       surface prevailing visibility, and any occurrence of previously unreported weather
       conditions that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other
       local operations and resources.
   2.6.2. The WF will train all Robins Tower personnel on the CWW program. Training will
   include a written evaluation with a minimum passing score of 80%. Training must be
   completed prior to the controller receiving their first position certification in the tower.
       2.6.2.1. Document limited weather observation certifications for all Robins Tower
       personnel on AF IMT 3622, Air Traffic Control/Weather Certification and Rating
       Record.

MHz. The DT will monitor PMSV traffic for aircraft contacts whenever the station is manned.
Aircraft outside the range of the Robins WF PMSV can contact another weather station or reach
the WF through a phone patch via the Robins Command Post. When the Robins WF PMSV is
ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014                                                              17


inoperative, the WF will notify Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS). They will place the
outage on local Airfield Advisories and NOTAMS. The message will read similar to “PMSV
RADIO 349.850 INOP; contact Robins Command Post DSN 497-2612 C478-327-2612 for
phone patch, during non-duty hours 26 OWS DSN 331-2651 C318-529-2651”. Local FLIPs also
document procedures for in-flight aircrews to receive real-time weather information during
PMSV outages.
2.8. Emergency Action(s) Response.
   2.8.1. Aircraft Mishap. When notified of an aircraft mishap, the WF will initiate a save of
   applicable data used in the development of any weather products provided and will give this
   data to investigating agencies upon request.
      2.8.1.1. If the WF provided the Mission Weather Product (MWP), the WF will notify the
      OWS Operations Floor Production Supervisor of the aircraft mishap as soon as possible
      after notification of the event. The WF will coordinate with the 26 OWS to save all
      applicable data and products. If products from other OWSs were used, the WF will
      coordinate with all applicable OWSs to ensure data is saved. Enough data covering
      weather conditions before and after the mishap will be saved to fully reconstruct
      environmental conditions. See A2.1.11 for observation requirements.
      2.8.1.2. If an OWS, TACC/XOW, or another WF provided the MWP, they will conduct
      the data save in coordination with any other Air Force Weather units involved.
   2.8.2. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The WF will initiate SWAP in
   accordance with criteria listed in Table 2.7 SWAP ensures sufficient manpower is available
   to meet the increased demand for timely weather information from supported unit(s) during
   significant weather events. It is imperative that timely and accurate weather watches,
   warnings, and advisories are disseminated to all agencies to ensure personnel and resource
   protection. The DT will notify WF leadership of SWAP activation during normal staff duty
   hours. During non-duty hours, the 26 OWS will notify the WF standby forecaster when
   conditions listed in Table 2.7 have been met and the WF technician will activate SWAP.

                                          Chapter 3

                                    MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF supports the Robins AFB flying and non-flying missions. This chapter
identifies the flying and non-flying missions and the weather support provided.
3.2. Flying Missions. The WF provides weather support to the flying units listed in
Attachment 6.
3.3. Mission Weather Products (MWPs). MWPs fuse theater scale products with local
mission requirements enabling the direct inject of weather impacts into warfighter planning
and/or execution. MWPs are tailored to individual customer requirements and include flight
weather briefings, mission planning briefs, and any other weather products prepared to meet the
needs of a supported unit. MWPs are developed using the Administrative and Operational
Mission Execution Forecast Process outlined in AFMAN 15-129V2 and supplemented by the
WF’s internal Mission Execution Forecast Process. The result is a product designed to provide
timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to various customers. The WF MWPs must
be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by the 26 OWS and
Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).
   3.3.1. Web-based Aviation Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). The daily web-based
   aviation MEF is designed to provide critical go/no-go weather information for all phases of
   local flying customers’ sorties (see Attachment 7 for sample product). It includes Take-
   Off/Landing Data (TOLD), solar/lunar data, flight hazards, and flight level winds for
   supported customers’ mission operating areas. The MEF is available through the WF
   webpage: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-MC-61/default.aspx (under Aviation Support
   Page). In the event of a Local Area Network (LAN) outage, the MEF will be faxed to the
   appropriate flying squadrons.
       3.3.1.1. Issue Times. The MEF will be issued during normal duty days at 0500L. It will
       not be issued when the airfield is closed and may not be issued during days when no
       flying missions are scheduled.
       3.3.1.2. Amendments/Updates. The MEF will be monitored continuously and updated
       as required. The MEF will be amended when the TOLD is out of category and/or the
       Route/Orbit/AR forecast is no longer representative of current or forecasted conditions
       and could adversely impact the scheduled sortie.
       3.3.1.3. Formal Briefing. Aircrews should call the WF forecaster at 468-3573 to
       receive any updates to the MEF and gain a full understanding of expected weather
       impacts to their mission. Aircrews should call no later than (NLT) 1 1/2 hours before
       their designated take-off time to receive their briefing.
       3.3.1.4. The WF will provide metrics on MEF accuracy and status of products/services
       as requested.
   3.3.2. Flight Weather Briefings (175-1s). Weather personnel will provide verbal or
   traditional flight weather briefings (DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing) to aircrews as
   requested and in accordance with the flight’s duty priorities as listed in Table 1.1 Briefings
   will be provided either at the weather station, or via fax/phone. Please provide 2 hours
ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014                                                                21


  advance notice of DD 175-1 request by calling 468-3573. Out-of-station mass briefings for
  special missions require 48-72-hours advance notice, are subject to staffing availability, and
  must be coordinated with weather flight leadership at 468-0383/0992. Transient aircrews can
  receive flight weather briefings from either the WF (if manning permits) or the 26 OWS.
  The 26 OWS can be contacted by phone (DSN 331-2651), fax (DSN 331-2609), or via the
  web at https://ows.barksdale.af.mil. The OWS requests 2 hours advance notice of DD 175-
  1 briefings.
  3.3.3. Tropical Weather Message. When tropical systems are forecast to come within
  400NM of Robins AFB, the WF will issue a tropical weather message. This will generally
  result in at least 5 days notice of potential storm impacts, and will contain all the latest
  information regarding the movement and forecast track of the storm, as well as the expected
  impact on Robins AFB. The tropical weather message will be provided via email to base
  leadership. The WF will include the RCP in the email enabling them to immediately start
  their checklists. The tropical weather message will be updated as needed (usually once per
  day) or more frequently if directed by the Installation Commander.
     3.3.3.1. Tropical Cyclone-Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP). The 26 OWS will
     issue a Tropical Cyclone-Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP) for Robins AFB when
     the base is expected to receive sustained winds > 35-knots during the next 96 hours as a
     result of a tropical cyclone. The TC-TAP is coordinated between the 26 OWS and WF
     and will contain at a minimum the start and end time of 35 and 50 knot winds, the peak
     wind speeds expected, and the storm’s closest point of approach to Robins AFB.
     AFMAN 15-129 V1 & V2 dictate that OWSs and WFs will not deviate from the official
     National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast track or intensity, but may tailor impacts to
     Robins based on experience, training, and local terrain effects. If a TC-TAP is in effect,
     WF personnel may not deviate from the product when advising base leadership.
     3.3.3.2. Hurricane Briefings. The WF will provide the most up-to-date weather
     briefings regarding any tropical cyclone activity anytime deemed necessary by the Crisis
     Action Team (CAT) and 78 ABW leadership. Additionally, the WF will provide up-to-
     date weather briefings to the WR-ALC leadership, 116 ACW, 461 ACW, and Marine
     Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 773 as requested and provided as timely as possible
     based upon most current NHC update.
     3.3.3.3. Hurricane Conditions (HURCON). Upon advisement from the WF, the
     installation commander will set the HURCON described below for Robins AFB. These
     conditions alert base agencies of the need to consider resource protection measures
     related to tropical weather.
         3.3.3.3.1. HURCON 4: 72 - hours prior to the arrival of sustained surface winds >
         50 knots.
         3.3.3.3.2. HURCON 3: 48 - hours prior to the arrival of sustained surface winds >
         50 knots.
         3.3.3.3.3. HURCON 2: 24 - hours prior to the arrival of sustained surface winds >
         50 knots.
         3.3.3.3.4. HURCON 1: 12 - hours prior to the arrival of sustained surface winds >
         50 knots.
 22                                                        ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014


3.4. MISSIONWATCH. This is a deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather and/or
the space environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors. The WF’s main tool
to accomplish this task is the Web Situation Display (WSD). The WSD is a FAA program that
allows the WF to constantly monitor Robins AFB airborne aircraft from take-off to recovery
(with the exception of HMLA-773 aircraft which do not appear on the WSD). For those
missions not visible on the WSD, traditional methods of mission following will be employed,
including knowledge of flight schedules, tactics, and close contact with Supervisors of Flying
(SOFs) and ops cells. Other meteorological and commercial data sources will be used to
accomplish this task at the discretion of the Duty Technician. During rapidly changing weather,
the WF will amend/update MWPs as required and contact the applicable agencies to pass on
critical changes and recommend alternatives to exploit mission weather. Forecasters continually
monitor the flight routes of each mission departing and returning to Robins AFB, and will
immediately notify the aircrew if weather develops in their route that was not previously
briefed/forecast. The 26 OWS will perform flight and route MISSIONWATCH for transient
flights they brief which depart from Robins AFB. The WF will perform flight and route
MISSIONWATCH for transient flights departing Robins AFB that were briefed by WF
personnel.
3.5. Post-Mission Analysis / Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129V2, units that regularly utilize
weather support from the WF will provide post-mission/utilization feedback, when possible. The
WF will utilize this data to refine their mission support and gauge unit strengths and challenges.
Weather flight leadership will utilize feedback to tailor the Mission Execution Forecast Process,
aiding continuous improvement of WF products. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
   3.5.1. Web-based feedback form, currently located on the Robins Weather webpage:
   https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-MC-
   61/Aviation%20Weather/_layouts/viewlsts.aspx?BaseType=4 under Aviation Support
   Page Aircrew Feedback Form.
   3.5.2. Local weather brief feedback forms are located at the WF briefing counter and are
   also attached to all faxed briefings.
   3.5.3. Email and/or phone calls to the flight commander or flight chief.
   3.5.4. Routing through the base mail system.
   3.5.5. In-person feedback in conjunction with briefings.
3.6. Transient Aircrew Support. Weather technicians will provide or arrange for weather
support for transient aircrews IAW the duty priorities listed in Table 1.1 The WF may provide
flight weather briefings (175-1s), and/or updates to aircrews. Weather technicians may arrange
for weather support from the 26 OWS briefing cell when greater duty priorities take precedence.
The 26 OWS briefing cell can be reached at DSN 331-2651/2652, commercial (318) 529-
2651/2652, or via web access from the aircrew briefing terminal located in the flight planning
room (https://ows.barksdale.af.mil).
3.7. Aero Club Activities. The WF will provide flight weather briefings to Aero Club members
performing official Air Force operational duties (i.e. Civil Air Patrol and Initial Flying Training
Programs). The WF will provide or arrange briefings when such Aero Club flights are in a
transient status through the appropriate OWS or Flight Service Station. The WF will not remain
open on weekends or during periods of airfield closure to provide briefings for routine Aero club
ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014                                                                23


Flying activities. The WF will advise Aero Club members performing official flight duties of the
OWS web page request process and self-briefing capabilities.
3.8. Non-Flying Missions. The WF supports various non-flying missions (e.g., Wing Picnic,
change of command ceremonies, Morale Welfare and Recreation) through resource protection
(WWAs). Specific support to non-flying missions is identified in Chapter 4. Specialized
weather information can be provided to support any DoD non-flying mission upon request.
However, weather information will not be released to non-DoD agencies or the general public
without approval from the 78 ABW Public Affairs and Legal offices. Any questions/
clarifications will be coordinated through the WF commander and/or flight chief (468-
0992/0383).
3.9. Space Weather Impacts. Robins AFB missions have a wide-variety of parameters
affected by various space-weather conditions (High Frequency and Ultra High Frequency
communication, radar, Global Positioning System communications, etc.). The WF provides
space impacts on their MWPs.                  More detailed products are available at:
https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/by_type/space/index.cfm?fuseaction=space_weather&UID=&BW=
H&UF=M&AOR=1&USEHF=1&CFID=24274639&CFTOKEN=35375536. An example of the
daily discussion is provided in Attachment 8.
3.10. Tactical Decision Aids. At this time, no parent/host units require Tactical Decision Aids
(TDAs) or electro-optical aids such as the Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS).
Weather flight leadership requires that parent/host units inform them of changes to their TDA
needs so that procedures, training, and software can be generated accordingly.

                                           Chapter 5

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on back-up
systems, maintenance, and restoral priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses advanced meteorological equipment to
determine the current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems provide customers the most
timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible.
   5.2.1. FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 samples, measures, and reports: temperature, wind speed and
   direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent
   precipitation accumulation, ice accretion during freezing precipitation and lightning strikes.
   These measurements are processed to create properly formatted, fully automated
   observations that comply with applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined
   by the Federal Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization
   (WMO), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and
   military reporting standards.
   5.2.2. GIBSON-RIDGE SOFTWARE. The WF utilizes Gibson Ridge Software as its
   primary source of radar data. Weather technicians use software to analyze complex radar
   signatures and obtain detailed information on storm intensity, movement, internal circulation,
   and general wind flow. Weather technicians will routinely incorporate the latest radar
   information into Mission Weather Products and Resource Protection actions. Back-up source
   for radar provided through WeatherTap website.
   5.2.3. Lightning Detection. The National Lightning Detection Network provides the WF
   with national lightning data. This national lightning data is received via a satellite antenna
   installed on the roof of building 110. Back-up sources of national lightning data are available
   through the Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-WEBS) and WeatherTap websites.
   5.2.4. Kestrel 4500. The Kestrel is a hand-held device that provides temperature, dew point,
   wind speed/direction, and pressure readings. The Kestrel is the primary source of backup
   meteorological data during FMQ-19 outages.
5.3. Communications Equipment. The following systems form the backbone of the WF
communications network.
   5.3.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). As discussed in paragraph 2.5, JET is the
   primary system for disseminating forecasts, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories.
   When JET is out-of-service, telephones are used to contact key aircraft controlling agencies.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service Radio (349.850 MHz) allows the WF to
   communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as Robins Tower
   personnel. If the PMSV is out-of- service, aircrews can contact the OWS via phone patch
   (where possible) to get weather data.
ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014                                                                  33


   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and direct lines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, and also serve as a backup for passing along information
   when other dissemination systems fail.
   5.3.4. LAN. The WF relies heavily on the local area network to guarantee the timeliness
   and accuracy of weather intelligence to its customers.
5.4. Maintenance. Table 5.1. identifies which organizations provide preventive maintenance
and repairs for weather and communications equipment.

 78 ABW/SC (Network Maintenance)                           LAN/Internet Connectivity
   5.4.1. Restoral Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems exist in the event that a
   natural disaster or any other anomaly simultaneously impacts systems base wide. Significant
   indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative, while minimal means
   the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment are listed in
   Table 5.2 (priorities may be adjusted based on forecasted weather):

      A2.1.7.3. Ice pellets begin, end, or change intensity.
      A2.1.7.4. Any other type of precipitation begins or ends. NOTE: Except for freezing
      rain, freezing drizzle, hail, and ice pellets, a SPECI is not required for changes in type
      (e.g., drizzle changing to snow grains) or the beginning or ending of one type while
      another is in progress (e.g., snow changing to rain and snow).
   A2.1.8. Tornado, Funnel Cloud, or Waterspout.
      A2.1.8.1. Is observed and/or disappears from sight or ends.
   A2.1.9. Runway Visual Range (RVR). The WF will provide RVR output according to the
   specifications listed in Table A2.3

Table A2.3. RVR Reporting. RVR for active runway decreases to less than or, if below,
increases to equal or exceed:
       6000 ft - AFMAN 15-111                               2400 ft – AFMAN 15-111/FLIP

   prevailing visibility goes above 1SM/1600 meters.
   A2.1.9.2. RVR is first determined as unavailable (RVRNO) for the active runway, and
   when it is first determined that the "NO" report is no longer applicable, provided conditions
   for reporting RVR still exist. For example, if the active runway is 33, and the 33 vis sensor is
   inoperative, the 15 sensor may not be used to back-up RVR. The RVRNO remark must be
   appended to column 13.
   A2.1.10. Upon Resumption of Observing Services. Take, disseminate, and record a
   SPECI within 15 minutes after returning to duty following a break in observing coverage or
   augmentation if a METAR was not filed as scheduled during the preceding 15-minute period.
   A2.1.11. Aircraft Mishap. When operating in back-up mode, a SPECI will be taken
   immediately following notification or sighting of an aircraft mishap at or near the observing
   location unless there has been an intervening observation. This SPECI will be identified by
   including (ACFT MSHP) in remarks on the AF Form 3803/3813 only. This remark will not
   be transmitted locally or longline.
   A2.1.12. Any other meteorological situation that, in the weather technician's opinion, is
   critical.

 44                                                      ROBINSAFBI15-101 25 JUNE 2014


A4.1.1. Type of Report. METAR or SPECI.
   A4.1.2. Station identifier, also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the
   observation (in this case Robins AFB).
   A4.1.3. Date and Time of Report. This is in Zulu (GMT) of the last element of the
   observation.
   A4.1.4. Report Modifier. The report modifier can be either of the following two elements:
      A4.1.4.1. COR is entered into the report modifier group when a corrected METAR or
      SPECI is transmitted.
      A4.1.4.2. AUTO identifies the report as a fully automated report with no human
      intervention.
          A4.1.4.2.1. AUTO is automatically included in reports when the weather technician
          signs off the AMOS indicating the observations are no longer being augmented.
          A4.1.4.2.2. AUTO and COR will not be seen in the same observation. If the term
          COR is used, the observation cannot be reported as AUTO, since a weather
          technician is manually correcting the observation.
   A4.1.5. Wind. The true direction the wind is blowing from encoded in tens of degrees using
   three figures. Directions less than 100 degrees are preceded with a "0." The wind speed is
   entered as a two or three digit group immediately following the wind direction.
      A4.1.5.1. Gust. The wind gust is encoded in two or three digits immediately following
      the wind speed. The wind gust is encoded in whole knots using the units and tens digits
      and, if required, the hundreds digit.
      A4.1.5.2. Variable Wind Direction (speeds 6 knots or less). Variable wind direction
      with wind speed 6 knots or less may be encoded as VRB in place of the direction.
      A4.1.5.3. Variable Wind Direction (speeds greater than 6 knots). Wind direction
      varying 60 degrees or more with wind speed greater than 6 knots will be encoded. The
      variable wind direction group will immediately follow the wind group. The directional
      variability will be encoded in a clockwise direction. For example, if the wind is variable
      from 180 degrees to 240 degrees at 10 knots, it would be encoded 21010KT 180V240.
      A4.1.5.4. Calm Wind. Calm wind is encoded as 00000KT.
   A4.1.6. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) seen
   from the airfield reported in statute miles (CONUS) or meters (OCONUS).
   A4.1.7. Runway Visual Range. An instrumentally derived value that represents the
   horizontal distance that a pilot can see down the runway. RVRNO indicates that RVR
   information is not available during periods when prevailing visibility is 1 mile (1600 meters)
   or less or RVR is 6,000 feet (1830 meters) or less.
   A4.1.8. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon occurring on the airfield. This is
   mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A4.2 lists the present weather
   codes:

A9.1. General. Most resource protection forecasts for Robins AFB are valid for 5 nautical
miles from the center point of the runway complex. The area within the red ring on Figure A9.1
below depicts this 5 nautical miles area. An observed thunderstorm advisory is valid for an area
within 10 nautical miles of the airfield complex. This area is shown shaded in blue. Figure
A9.2 depicts the 400 nautical mile range ring around Robins AFB which is used for observed
tropical cyclone advisories.
