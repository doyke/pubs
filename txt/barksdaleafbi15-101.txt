     OSS/OSW focuses on providing tactical-level weather products and information needed for
     mission planning and execution during wartime, contingency, exercise, and peacetime
     operations.
     1.2.2. Coordination: Weather support coordination actions between 2 OSS/OSW and 26
     OWS are outlined on the 2 OSS/OSW installation data page. It also includes a list of current
     BAFB Weather Warning, Watch, and Advisory (WWA) criteria. The installation data page is
     located
     here:https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/Tech_Ref/data_sheets/index.cfm?UID=&BW=H&UF=
     M&AOR=1&USEHF=1.
     1.2.3. 26 OWS Responsibilities: 26 OWS provides weather watches, warnings and advisory
     (WWA), Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF’s), regional and operational-level weather
     products and information, meteorological watch (METWATCH) and limited flight weather
     Mission Execution Products (MEPs).
        1.2.3.1. TAF: The 26 OWS is responsible for creating and issuing a TAF for BAFB
        every eight hours (0200Z, 1000Z, and 1800Z). Each TAF will cover a 30-hour period.
        These forecasts apply to an area within a five nautical mile (NM) radius of the center of
        the runway complex. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airport code
        for Barksdale AFB is KBAD. See AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes, Chapter 1 for
        code breakdown.
        1.2.3.2. Specification and Amendment Criteria: TAF amendments are unscheduled
        forecast updates which revise the content of the current forecast. TAF specification and
        amendment criteria are specified in AFMAN 15-129V1. Ceiling and visibility conditions
        specific to BAFB are listed in Attachment 2 and are reflected on the 2 OSS/OSW
        installation data page. 26 OWS will amend the TAF as required.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                              7


       1.2.3.3. Dissemination: 26 OWS will disseminate the TAF via the Joint Environmental
       Toolkit (JET). If JET is inoperative, the TAF will be distributed through Air Force
       Weather Web Services (AFW-WEBS) and email, fax, or phone to 2 OSS/OSW. 2
       OSS/OSW will in-turn, call the air traffic control tower (ATC) with the current forecast
       for flying purposes.
       1.2.3.4. Interruptions: If weather operations are interrupted (e.g., power outage, natural
       disaster), the following actions will be taken:
       1.2.4.1. 26 OWS: If weather operations at the 26 OWS are interrupted, 26 OWS will
       contact
2 OSS/OSW. BAFB TAF and WWA responsibility will be transferred to 2 OSS/OSW until
26 OWS is postured to resume operations. Responsibility for other 26 OWS products (e.g.,
graphical products) will be transferred to other agencies as necessary to continue weather
information flow to BAFB units.
       1.2.4.2. 2 OSS/OSW: If weather operations at 2 OSS/OSW are interrupted, 2 OSS/OSW
       will contact 26 OWS. 2 OSS/OSW responsibilities for observed WWA support, MEP
       (e.g. DD 175-1), and other mission forecast products will be transferred to 26 OWS until
       2 OSS/OSW is postured to resume operations, ensuring continued weather information
       flow to BAFB units. If JET, e-mail, and fax are not operational, 26 OWS will verbally
       pass weather products and information to 2 OSS/OSW. If 2 OSS/OSW cannot transmit
       an airfield observation via JET, they will pass all observations via telephone to ATC and
       enter observations into the Automated Weather Network or relay all observations via
       telephone to another weather unit (e.g., 26 OWS).
1.3. Duty Priorities.

Table 1. 1 lists the prioritization of weather station tasks:

Table 1.1. 2 OSS/OSW Duty Priorities.




1.4. Geographic Area of Responsibility (AOR): The AOR for products and services provided
by 2 OSS/OSW is the terminal area, which is the area located within a 5 nautical-mile (NM)
radius around the center of the BAFB airfield complex. 2 OSS/OSW will also provide MEP
support and MISSIONWATCH for all areas and routes in which BAFB flying units are
conducting operations.
1.5. Operating Hours:
     1.5.1. 2 OSS/OSW duty hours will be scheduled, based on the operational need of the BAFB
     flying unit operations and/or when ATC is open and no automated observing capability
     exists. Airfield Support functions (e.g. weather observations, PMSV, and WWAs) and
     Mission Integration functions (e.g. MEP production) are provided whenever supported unit
     flying operations are being conducted. Staff Integration functions (e.g. liaison, climatic
     support, and training) are available M-F 0730L-1630L. Assuming a fully-functional
     AN/FMQ-19, only automated weather observations are disseminated during limited duty
     operations or scheduled airfield closures.
     1.5.2. 2 OSS/OSW hours of operation will flex/surge to meet BAFB operational needs.
     1.5.3. 2 OSS/OSW will provide duty/standby hours and contact numbers for the standby
     forecaster to the 26 OWS, Airfield Operations Flight (2 OSS/OSA), Air Traffic Control
     (ATC), and the Command Post (CP) no later than 24 hours in advance of the closure to allow
     26 OWS leadership to reallocate resources, as required.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                            9


   1.5.4. Non-Operating Hours: Weather personnel will be available for recall during non-
   operating hours. 26 OWS will assume METWATCH responsibilities and will notify the
   standby forecaster when 2 OSS/OSW is closed.
1.6. Limited Duty and Holiday Operations: During periods of non 2 BW and all local tenant
units’ assigned flying, the 2 OSS/OSW is not required to have personnel on duty unless the
Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) has been implemented or no automated observing
capability exists.
1.7. Contact Information.

Table 1.2. 2 OSS/OSW Contact Information




1.8. Dissemination of Weather Information.
   1.8.1. The primary notification system for weather information is the JET web-based
   display. The secondary notification system is via automated phone calls, manual notification
   by weather personnel, and follow-up phone calls to ATC, CP, 2 OSS/OSA, and 26 OWS.
   1.8.2. Automated Dissemination. JET is designated as the single point for weather personnel
   to disseminate weather products to both off-base and on-base agencies and/or as a secondary
   notification to the ATC during Information Display System 5 (IDS-5) outages through the
   following address https://131.10.199.44/atc/ATC.action.
   1.8.3. Base agencies can view JET via an internet browser at the following address:
   https://owsjet26.us.af.mil/portal/private/guest_barksdale/AreaWeather. This dedicated
   account will display the automated weather sensors, latest observation, TAF, and WWAs.
   1.8.4. Report all JET outages to 2 OSS/OSW at 456-3136 or 456-3176.
1.9. Alternate Operating Location (AOL):
   1.9.1. In the event 2 OSS/OSW is forced to evacuate building 6402, weather operations will
   relocate to Room 218 in the Warrior Center, building 6067. The AOL telephone # is (318)
   456-4132/ DSN 781-4132.
   1.9.2. The JET system may be impacted by loss of power or lack of connectivity in the event
   2 OSS/OSW is forced to evacuate building 6402. If JET cannot be updated with current
   weather information, then weather personnel will transmit weather updates via AFW-WEBS
   and/or telephone to select base agencies. The priorities for notification are as follows:
      1.9.2.1. ATC
 10                                              BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014


      1.9.2.2. CP
      1.9.2.3. 26 OWS
      1.9.2.4. 2 OSS/OSA
   1.9.3. During AOL operations the following functions will be impacted.
      1.9.3.1. Airfield Services:
          1.9.3.1.1. PMSV: Upon arrival to the AOL, 2 OSS/OSW personnel will notify CP
          and ATC to monitor the weather radio frequency and pass any information via
          telephone, if required.
          1.9.3.1.2. Weather observations: Weather observation support will be degraded if the
          AN/FMQ-19 is unavailable during AOL operations. At a minimum, all weather
          elements in the observation will be taken using backup/tactical equipment. Wind
          direction, wind speed, and altimeter setting will be estimated due to use of the tactical
          equipment. Runway Visual Range (RVR) reading will not be available.
      1.9.3.2. Mission Integration: Mission execution forecast products and briefing support
      may be altered. Units who do not have access to the AOL will receive their mission
      execution forecast products and briefs via 2 OSS/OSW share point site:
      (https://barksdale.eis.af.mil/2%20BW/2og/2oss/w/default.aspx), telephone, or fax (if
      available).
      1.9.3.3. Staff Integration: Limited staff support will be available during AOL operations.
1.10. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP):
   1.10.1. 2 OSS/OSW will initiate SWAP when a weather watch and/or warning is issued for
   the following criteria:
      1.10.1.1. Tornadic activity
      1.10.1.2. Damaging Winds > 50 KTS (not associated with thunderstorms)
      1.10.1.3. Severe Thunderstorms (hail > 3/4 inch and/or damaging winds > 50 kts)
      1.10.1.4. Freezing Precipitation (any intensity)
   1.10.2. A Severe Weather Action Team leader will be appointed IAW 2 OSS/OSW Standard
   Operating Procedures (SOP’s) and will ensure 2 OSS/OSW is postured appropriately to
   ensure implementation of all severe weather action requirements. 2 OSS/OSW will remain
   open and SWAP will remain in effect until the expiration or cancellation of applicable
   watches and/or warnings.
   1.10.3. During limited duty operations or scheduled closures, 26 OWS will notify the
   standby forecaster when one or more SWAP criteria are forecasted. Upon notification, 2
   OSS/OSW will resume 24 hour operations to conduct SWAP IAW local SOPs.
   1.10.4. 2 OSS/OSW will supplement automated observations or take, disseminate, and
   record observations manually IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations, during
   SWAP. Safety of flight and resource protection is paramount. Supplement/backup
   observations will ensure “eyes forward” support to the 26 OWS and ensure all aspects of
   severe weather are fully identified, reported, and recorded.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                              11


   1.10.5. Post event procedures will include a verbal review of the actions taken by 2
   OSS/OSW and 26 OWS. A thorough forecast review will be accomplished IAW 2
   OSS/OSW and 26 OWS SOP’s if necessary or if damage occurs requiring an Operational
   Report (OPREP)-3 report.
1.11. Release of Weather Information: OPSEC and COMSEC will be considered prior to any
release of weather information. Specific restrictions do not exist on the dissemination of weather
information to other military agencies. Information exchange between 2 OSS/OSW and the local
National Weather Service (NWS) office is encouraged in the interest of public safety and
resource protection. Support to other non-military agencies, foreign governments or individuals
will be coordinated with the Staff Judge Advocate and Public Affairs offices before service or
information is provided. This restriction does not include indirect routine weather information is
passed on automated weather circuits or information passed through the NWS in the interest of
public safety.

                                           Chapter 2

                             AIRFIELD SUPPORT FUNCTIONS

2.1. General:
   2.1.1. 2 OSS/OSW will take, record, and disseminate surface weather observations for
   BAFB.
   2.1.2. 2 OSS/OSW operates the AN/FMQ-19 Automatic Meteorological Observing System
   (AMOS) to automatically collect and disseminate weather observations.
   2.1.3. 2 OSS/OSW observations procedures will be either a Continuous Weather Watch,
   using the AN/FMQ-19, or a Basic Weather Watch (BWW) as detailed in paragraph 2.3.
2.2. Continuous Weather Watch:
   2.2.1. BAFB possesses an AN/FMQ-19 and is classified as an Automated Observing
   Location. The AN/FMQ-19 is operated in full automatic mode to perform Continuous
   Weather Watch, providing Meteorological Aviation Report (METAR) and Aviation Selected
   Special Weather Report (SPECI) observations.
2.3. Basic Weather Watch (BWW).
   2.3.1. During periods of AN/FMQ-19 augmentation, forecasters are required to recheck
   weather conditions at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to
   determine the need for a SPECI or LOCAL observation.
   2.3.2. BWW will be performed when any of the following conditions are observed to be
   occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
      2.3.2.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 2,000 feet (local operational risk
      management (ORM) requirement)
      2.3.2.2. Ceiling dissipates or increases to equal or exceed 2,000 feet (local ORM
      requirement)
      2.3.2.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles
      2.3.2.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles
      2.3.2.5. Precipitation (any form)
      2.3.2.6. Thunderstorms
      2.3.2.7. Fog or Mist
      2.3.2.8. All supplemental criteria specified in Table 2.2
      2.3.2.9. During mandatory back-up of AMOS IAW AFMAN 15-111, paragraph 3.4
      2.3.2.10. In addition to the above minimum requirements, forecasters will remain alert
      for any other changes in weather conditions requiring a SPECI or LOCAL observation, as
      listed in Attachment 3.
   2.3.3. Weather personnel will also monitor local area observational and forecast products as
   often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect the AOR.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                             13


   2.3.4. The BWW will be conducted regardless of operating mode using sound ORM
   practices.
2.4. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW):
   2.4.1. A CWW program between 2 OSS/OSW and 2 OSS/OSA is established via 2 OSS
   Operating Instruction (OI) 15-1, Cooperative Weather Watch.
2.5. “Eyes Forward”/26 OWS Collaboration:
   2.5.1. General: The 2 OSS/OSW “eyes forward” function provides meaningful
   meteorological information not contained in coded observations to the 26 OWS and is an
   integral part of METWATCH for BAFB. 2 OSS/OSW will provide significant information
   to the 26 OWS concerning local area weather patterns and unforecasted changes so forecast
   products can be reevaluated and adjusted/updated, as required.
   2.5.2. Weather flight personnel will contact the 26 OWS immediately or as soon as practical
   when any of the following occur:
      2.5.2.1. KBAD TAF requires amendment.
      2.5.2.2. Observed Weather Advisories are issued.
      2.5.2.3. Watch or warning criteria is imminent and no WWA has been issued by 26
      OWS.
      2.5.2.4. Significant PIREPs are received or after recent aircrew debriefs/feedback.
      2.5.2.5. Reports of severe weather not normally available through standard observations
      (storm spotters, local law enforcement, local news media, unit personnel, etc.) are
      received.
   2.5.3. Route reports of unsatisfactory products or services at the lowest level of operations.
   Forward all unresolved issues to the 26 OWS Operations Superintendent and/or Director of
   Operations when time permits.
2.6. Meteorological Equipment.
   2.6.1. AN/FMQ-19: The AN/FMQ-19 is a highly sophisticated data sensing, processing, and
   dissemination system. The system continually senses and measures the atmosphere for the
   following weather elements and parameters: wind, visibility, precipitation, obstructions to
   vision, cloud height, sky cover, temperature, dew point, altimeter, and lightning. The system
   will also format and report specific automated remarks. The AN/FMQ-19 processes sensor
   data once a minute and produces a weather observation.
      2.6.1.1. The AN/FMQ-19 has two sensors, one located at each end of the runway. The
      direct readout terminal for these sensors is located in 2 OSS/OSW in Building 6402.
      Remote readouts can be obtained from JET. Attachment 4 lists the weather sensors and
      their approximate location on the airfield.
      2.6.1.2. "Objective" elements (e.g., pressure, temperature, dew point, and wind) are
      measured by both the AN/FMQ-19 and weather technician using a fixed location and
      time-averaging technique.
 14                                             BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014


      2.6.1.3. "Subjective" elements (e.g., sky condition, visibility and present weather) are
      measured by the weather technicians using a fixed time, spatial averaging technique to
      describe the visual elements. The AN/FMQ-19 uses a fixed location, time averaging
      technique.
      2.6.1.4. The 2 OSS/OSW will use sound ORM practices when the FMQ-19 reports light
      drizzle (-DZ) during periods of no observed precipitation and will only augment those
      observations if significant weather thresholds are crossed as set forth by AFMAN 15-111
      and HQ AFWA/A8F.
      2.6.1.5. All AN/FMQ-19 preventative maintenance and repairs will be conducted by 2d
      Communications Squadron, Operations Flight, and Airfield Systems Maintenance.
   2.6.2. Radar: 2 OSS/OSW operates Gibson Ridge 2 & 3 from the main Weather
   Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) operated by the NWS Office in Shreveport,
   Louisiana. The WSR-88D completes a volume scan every 4-6 minutes, providing an updated
   3-dimensional look at the atmosphere around the radar site. The WSR-88D has a maximum
   range of 248 NM. Between 124 NM and 248 NM it can only detect the location, movement
   and approximate storm tops and intensities. The radar provides only limited information on
   storms within 10 NM of the radar tower. Storms in this blind spot (cone of silence) can
   develop almost undetected.
      2.6.2.1. Gibson Ridge 2 is used at both the 2 OSS/OSW and 26 OWS for cell-
      interrogation.
      2.6.2.2. Gibson Ridge 3 (GR3) is utilized by 2 OSS/OSW for daily customer support and
      hosted on the forecaster’s workstation. GR3 displays high resolution base products, dual-
      polarization products, and derived products along with Local Storm Reports (LSRs) and
      severe weather warnings.
2.7. Weather Observations:
   2.7.1. 2 OSS/OSW technicians are responsible for all BAFB weather observations and must
   ensure the AMOS generates an official observation from the official observing location
   between 55-59 minutes past the hour.
   2.7.2. Reference AFMAN 15-111, Chapter 13 for specifics on METAR code.
   2.7.3. Official Observing Location: Automated observations are taken from the sensors
   located on the airfield, reference Attachment 4. Augmented weather observations are taken
   on the east side of Hangar 9, beyond the overhang, but not beyond the first double white line
   on the flight line.
   2.7.4. Types of Observations. Weather personnel make three types of weather observations:
   METAR, SPECI, and Local.
      2.7.4.1. METAR observations are taken between 45-55 minutes past the hour and
      transmitted between 55-59 minutes past the hour. Elements included in METAR
      observations are listed in paragraph 2.7.5 – 2.7.5.9.
      2.7.4.2. SPECI observations are taken when special criteria conditions exist. SPECI
      observations contain all elements included in a METAR observation, except for sea-level
      pressure. See Attachment 3 for SPECI criteria.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                             15


     2.7.4.3. Locals or Single-element Locals will only be taken during backup operations of
     the AN/FMQ-19 and IAW AFMAN 15-111. See Attachment 3 for LOCAL criteria.
  2.7.5. The following weather elements are observed by 2 OSS/OSW technicians and
  disseminated locally and longline IAW Federal Standard Algorithms for Automated Weather
  Observing Systems Used for Aviation Purposes.
     2.7.5.1. Time: All time entries will be in universal time coordinate.
     2.7.5.2. Wind Speed and Direction: The AN/FMQ-19 wind algorithm uses 5-second
     average wind directions and speeds to compute 2-minute averages for reporting direction
     and speed. The 5-second average speed represents an instantaneous wind and is used to
     determine gusts, squalls and peak wind data. The 2-minute average direction is used to
     determine wind shifts and the range of variability for variable wind direction reports.
     The wind direction and speed sensors provide the system processor with sufficient data to
     compute 5-second and 2-minute average wind speeds and directions. Wind direction is
     reported to the nearest ten degrees and is in reference to magnetic north. Wind speed is
     reported to the nearest whole knot.
     2.7.5.3. Prevailing Visibility: The greatest visibility equaled or exceeded in at least half
     of the horizon circle, not necessarily continuous. All visibilities are reported in statute
     miles (SM). The visibility algorithm calculates an average visibility. The visibility data
     during the averaging period are examined to determine if variable visibility should be
     reported. Using the AN/FMQ-19’s meteorological discontinuity sensors (secondary
     sensor located at Runway 33, primary located at runway 15), the data gathered is
     examined to determine if their values meet criteria for generating a visibility remark.
     2.7.5.4. Runway Visual Range: The AN/FMQ-19 will report RVR in the body of the
     observation whenever the prevailing visibility is 1 SM (1600 meters) or less and/or the
     RVR for the designated instrument runway is 6000 feet or less.
     2.7.5.5. Weather and Obstruction to Vision: Obstructions to vision will be determined
     and reported when the prevailing visibility is less than seven statue miles. AN/FMQ-19
     reports the type and intensity of precipitation, times of beginning and ending of
     precipitation, precipitation accumulation, and obscurations. This consists of both weather
     and non-weather phenomena which are observed or restrict visibility.
     2.7.5.6. Sky Condition: Sky condition is a description of the sky from the surface of the
     earth detailing sky coverage (see Table 2.1) and height above ground level (AGL) in
     hundreds of feet. The lowest layer aloft reported as broken or overcast is a ceiling. An
     automated sky condition is derived instrumentally by detecting the frequency and height
     of clouds passing over the sensor (ceilometer) over a period of 30 minutes. The
     AN/FMQ-19 reports sky condition from 100 feet up to a maximum of 25,000 feet.
 16                                            BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014


Table 2.1. Sky Cover Classification (extracted from AFMAN 15-111)




      2.7.5.7. Temperature and Dew Point: The AN/FMQ-19 measures temperature and dew
      point in degrees Celsius. The maximum and minimum temperatures are based on the
      highest and lowest average temperatures during the period of evaluation.
      2.7.5.8. Altimeter Setting/Sea-Level Pressure: The pressure algorithms compute a
      pressure relative to the field elevation and then based on that value, derive the pressure
      parameters (e.g., station pressure, altimeter setting, and sea-level pressure).
      Computations are made each minute.
      2.7.5.9. Remarks: Significant remarks will be disseminated on all observations to
      present a more precise picture of existing weather conditions.
   2.7.6. All observations are sent to local base agencies using JET. All observations are also
   sent into the Automated Weather Network for use by non-base agencies.
      2.7.6.1. In the event of a JET outage, observations will be disseminated locally via
      telephone to ATC.
      2.7.6.2. Longline dissemination will be accomplished by uploading the data through the
      Air Force Weather Web Services (AFW-WEBS) or via telephone to another base weather
      station.
   2.7.7. Augmentation:
      2.7.7.1. The AN/FMQ-19 will be operated in full automated mode. 2 OSS/OSW will
      monitor the system in the event augmentation is necessary. When 2 OSS/OSW is closed,
      the AN/FMQ-19 disseminates unmonitored automated weather observations.
      2.7.7.2. Weather personnel will augment weather observations IAW AFMAN 15-111.
      The two augmentation processes are supplementing and backup.
          2.7.7.2.1. Augmenting Weather Observations – Supplementing
              2.7.7.2.1.1. Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological
              information to an automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the
              AN/FMQ-19 to detect and/or report.
              2.7.7.2.1.2. 2 OSS/OSW personnel conduct a BWW (see paragraph 2.3) and will
              supplement observations when the weather conditions in Table 2.2 are forecast to
              occur within 1 hour or are occurring.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                            17


Table 2.2. Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions




              2.7.7.2.1.3. Remarks will be added when supplementing for the above criteria.
              IAW AFGSC Policy, snow depth will only be reported during weather station
              operating hours and if snow is present on the ground or if SWAP is initiated and a
              heavy snow warning has been issued and snowfall is occurring.
          2.7.7.2.2. Augmenting Weather Observations – Backup:
              2.7.7.2.2.1. Backup is the method of manually providing meteorological data
              and/or dissemination to the AN/FMQ-19 observation when the primary automated
              method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication
              failure.
              2.7.7.2.2.2. 2 OSS/OSW personnel will use manual observing methods when
              augmenting the AN/FMQ-19. Back-up the specific observation elements missing
              or incorrect due to sensor and/or communication failure.
              2.7.7.2.2.3. 2 OSS/OSW personnel will not perform backup when the airfield is
              closed.
   2.7.8. Limitations of weather observation capabilities:
      2.7.8.1. Augmented observations are hampered from the observation point due to ramp
      floodlights at night and the following obstructions from 150° through 330°:
          2.7.8.1.1. Trees from north to south (approximately 1 1/2 SM).
          2.7.8.1.2. Hangars and buildings to the south and west (less than 1/4 SM).
          2.7.8.1.3. Parked aircraft to the north and south.
          2.7.8.1.4. Presence of obstructions results in a lack of visibility markers beyond 2
          SM.
      2.7.8.2. The AN/FMQ-19 substitutes time averaging of the sensor data for weather
      elements based upon spatial averaging techniques (e.g., sky cover and visibility). All
      other elements evaluated are based on sensor data within 10 minutes or less of the actual
      time of observation.
      2.7.8.3. Radar “Cone of Silence”: The WSR-88D is blind to any weather directly over
      the radar dish and extending upward, in an inverted cone shape. This blind spot allows
      thunderstorms to develop largely undetected within a 10 NM radius of the radar.
      2.7.8.4. Lightning Detection: 2 OSS/OSW relies on the AN/FMQ-19 for local lightning
      data. 2 OSS/OSW supplements using various national lightning detection networks via
 18                                              BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014


      the internet. These networks only detect about 95 percent of the cloud-to-ground
      lightning strikes. Lightning detection networks cannot detect in-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, or
      cloud-to-air lightning strikes. The absence of detected strikes does not assure absence of
      lightning.
2.8. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV):
   2.8.1. 2 OSS/OSW operates a PMSV radio to provide updated weather information to
   airborne aircrews and to receive PIREPs. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) channel 227.4 MHz
   is continuously monitored. When 2 OSS/OSW is closed, aircrews can receive PMSV
   support by requesting a phone patch to the 26 OWS [(318) 529-2651/DSN 331-2651].
   2.8.2. Aircrews should relay PIREPs of significant weather conditions encountered during
   takeoff/climb-out, approach, landing, and in the local pattern. In the interest of flight safety,
   it is important for all hazardous or unforecasted weather conditions be promptly reported.
   2.8.3. PIREPs can be passed directly through PMSV, ATC personnel or SOF. ATC or SOF
   will relay PIREPs to 2 OSS/OSW within five minutes of receipt when 2 OSS/OSW is open.
   2.8.4. 2 OSS/OSW will disseminate PIREPs locally whenever the airfield conditions could
   impact safety of flight operations. These conditions include, but are not limited to, low-level
   wind shear, icing of any type or intensity, moderate or greater turbulence, or any other
   significant weather phenomena.
2.9. Weather Watch, Warning, and Advisories (WWAs):
   2.9.1. WWAs should give base agencies sufficient notice to implement preventative safety
   measures.
   2.9.2. 2 OSS/OSW is responsible for issuing observed warnings and advisories. Forecast
   WWAs are issued by the 26 OWS.
   2.9.3. All WWAs, with the exception of thunderstorm advisories, are issued for the
   immediate vicinity of the Barksdale aerodrome complex.
   2.9.4. WWAs will be issued IAW AFMAN 15-129V1, AFI 10-229 and local requirements.
   2.9.5. WWAs are issued via Integrated Weather Warning Capability (IWWC) using a
   standard numbering scheme resident in the software. The text of WWAs will contain a
   WWA number, a specific valid time period (until further notice (UFN) for observed
   products), and expected conditions.
   2.9.6. Weather Watch:
      2.9.6.1. A weather watch is a special notice provided to supported BAFB units alerting
      them to the potential for weather conditions within the forecast area during the specified
      valid time of such intensity to pose a hazard to life or property. The weather watch can
      be thought of as a “heads up,” at which time agencies need to consider implementing
      required protective actions should a subsequent weather warning be issued. Watches
      normally precede a weather warning.
      2.9.6.2. Weather watches are issued for the criteria listed in table 2.3. Deviations to the
      standard weather watch criteria are due to local requirements.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                              19


Table 2.3. Forecast Weather Watch Criteria and Minimum Desired Lead-Times.




   2.9.7. Weather Warning:
      2.9.7.1. A weather warning is a special notice provided to supported BAFB units giving
      them advance notification (with sufficient time for protective actions) when weather
      conditions within the forecast area exist, are imminent, or are highly likely to occur of
      such intensity to pose a hazard to personnel, resources, and property.
      2.9.7.2. Weather warnings are issued for the criteria listed in table 2.4. Deviations to the
      standard weather warning criteria are due to local requirements.

Table 2.4. Forecast Weather Warning Criteria and Minimum Desired Lead-Times.




   2.9.8. Weather Advisory:
      2.9.8.1. A weather advisory is a special message which notifies BAFB units of
      established weather conditions that require certain protective actions by various base
      agencies.
      2.9.8.2. With the exception of the forecast 25-34 knots wind advisory, weather advisories
      are issued for the observed criteria listed in table 2.5 and once issued will be valid UFN.
 20                                             BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014


Table 2.5. Observed Weather Advisory Criteria and Minimum Desired Lead-Times.




   2.9.9. Weather Watch, Warning and Advisory Dissemination:
      2.9.9.1. 2 OSS/OSW and/or 26 OWS will initiate WWA dissemination to the primary
      dissemination agencies listed in Attachment 5.
          2.9.9.1.1. Primary WWA dissemination method is through the JET computer display.
          Each agency on the dissemination net then makes additional notifications to their
          respective agencies.
          2.9.9.1.2. Secondary WWA dissemination method is an automated phone call
          initiated through JET or manually via telephone. In the event JET is inoperable, 2
          OSS/OSW will call the ATC, CP, 2 OSS/OSA, and 26 OWS. These agencies are
          responsible in-turn for notifying their respective agencies.
      2.9.9.2. The forecaster will always telephone the CP to disseminate a tornado warning in
      order to rapidly initiate the Base Public Address Warning System (BPAWS) tornado
      siren.
      2.9.9.3. 2 OSS/OSW will verify all WWA notifications are received by ATC, 2
      OSS/OSA and CP. This will be accomplished IAW local SOPs.
      2.9.9.4. During 2 OSS/OSW non-duty hours, this notification requirement will be met by
      the 26 OWS IAW installation data page.
      2.9.9.5. Refer to Attachment 5 for the WWA notification matrix, 2 BW notification
      requirements, and customer response matrix.
2.10. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Reviews:
   2.10.1. 2 OSS/OSW will coordinate with the Airfield Manager whenever changes to the
   FLIP for BAFB are necessary.
   2.10.2. FLIP changes are required for the following criteria:
      2.10.2.1. Change in Operating Hours.
      2.10.2.2. Change in PMSV frequency.
      2.10.2.3. Change in contact number for supporting OWS.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                          21


     2.10.2.4. Change in ceiling or visibility thresholds.
     2.10.2.5. Change in pertinent information to observing operations (values being
     estimated due to primary equipment outage, restricted visibility due to trees, buildings,
     etc.).
  2.10.3. 2 OSS/OSA will provide 2 OSS/OSW with the new FLIP on arrival for review of
  new airfield minimums.
  2.10.4. FLIPs will be reviewed for accuracy by 2 OSS/OSW every time an update is issued.
 22                                             BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014

                         MISSION INTEGRATION FUNCTIONS

3.1. General:
   3.1.1. 2 OSS/OSW operations will be configured in a manner that maximizes 2 OSS/OSW’s
   ability to reliably “inject the right information at the right time every time” into the 2 BW
   and tenant units flying and non-flying organizations mission planning, execution, and
   assessment processes.
   3.1.2. In order to effectively provide actionable weather intelligence to commanders and
   mission planners, 2 OSS/OSW must be included in supported units planning processes at the
   appropriate time.
   3.1.3. 2 OSS/OSW will focus training on commonly used Military Operating Areas (MOA)
   and Air Refueling (AR) tracks provided by mission planners.
      3.1.3.1. During training missions, some of the more common used MOAs are Lancer,
      Smokey Hill, Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), Yuma, Sumner and Warrior. Some
      of the more common AR tracks used are AR104, AR116, AR101, AR313, and AR112.
      3.1.3.2. Common alternate airfields used by Barksdale AFB flying units are Tinker AFB
      (KTIK), McConnell AFB (KIAB), Dyess AFB (KDYS), Minot AFB (KMIB), Navy Fort-
      Worth (KNFW) and Whiteman AFB (KSZL)
   3.1.4. 2 OSS/OSW will provide one or more weather technicians to perform mission
   integration functions throughout the entire mission planning/execution process. Personnel
   are responsible for providing tailored mission forecast products.
   3.1.5. 2 OSS/OSW can support briefings up to Top Secret.
3.2. Weather Impact Matrix:
   3.2.1. Mission limiting environmental thresholds and sensitivities applicable to BAFB
   operations and weapons systems are identified in the 2 OSS/OSW Weather Impact Matrix
   (Attachment 6).
   3.2.2. Weather impacts are defined using a RED/AMBER/GREEN stoplight chart format:

Table 3.1. Weather Operational Impacts:




   3.2.3. Weather thresholds will be integrated into mission weather products (see paragraph
   3.3) where appropriate. Thresholds will be reevaluated during the planning phase of each
   mission/operation and can/will be adjusted as needed by mission commanders and 2
   OSS/OSW personnel in order to ensure mission success.
3.3. Mission Weather Products (MWPs):
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                         23


  3.3.1. MWP Description:
     3.3.1.1. MWPs are designed to fuse theater scale products with BAFB mission
     requirements in order to exploit weather conditions. MWPs can include: MEFs, long
     range forecasts, mission planning briefs, environmental inputs to mission analysis,
     weather staff estimates, climatology analysis, and any other weather products which meet
     the need of BAFB units.
     3.3.1.2. MWPs are developed utilizing the Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP).
     The 2 OSS/OSW MEFP is defined by internal SOPs and AFMAN 15-129V2.
     3.3.1.3. MWPs produced by 2 OSS/OSW will be based on specific forecasted time
     scales.
  3.3.2. Extended Long-Range Forecast: 120 hours – 384 hours:
     3.3.2.1. High-fidelity weather forecasts beyond 120 hours are typically unreliable.
     However weather forecasters can generally predict impacts to operations based on
     climatological data.
     3.3.2.2. Climatology Services. Upon request, 2 OSS/OSW personnel will produce
     climatological analysis of mission thresholds, weather impacts, or other environmental
     information in order for mission planners to effectively integrate weather information
     into their planning process.
  3.3.3. Long Range Impact Forecast (5 Day): 48 hours – 120 hours
     3.3.3.1. OSS/OSW personnel will produce a 120 hour (5 day) long range forecast of key
     weather elements and associated impacts for BAFB and supported missions/operations.
     3.3.3.2. The long range impact forecast will be posted on the 2 OG Share Point no later
     than (NLT) 0500L daily. See Attachment 7 for an example long range impact forecast.
     The       2       OG         Share      Point       is      located     at       URL:
     https://barksdale.eis.af.mil/2%20BW/2og/2oss/w/default.aspx.
     3.3.3.3. The long range impact forecast is valid for 24 hours and will be
     amended/updated based on Flight CC/NCOIC discretion.
     3.3.3.4. The long range impact forecast is intended to provide commanders and mission
     planners a multi-day outlook of weather effects in order to minimize impacts to
     operations and maximize favorable weather conditions. The forecast product is divided
     into two separate sections:
         3.3.3.4.1. Section 1 - Forecast: forecasted weather elements for BAFB include: cloud
         cover/precipitation, temperature, surface wind speed and direction, ceiling, surface
         visibility, expected weather phenomena, and precipitation totals.
         3.3.3.4.2. Section 2 - Impacts: based on the forecasted weather elements, impacts
         will be depicted in 6 hour increments using thresholds from the 2 OSS/OSW weather
         impact matrix (Attachment 6). Impacts will be depicted for operational impacts to B-
         52 flying operations, vehicles, and personnel at/on BAFB.
  3.3.4. Mission Planning Weather: 0 – 48 hours
24                                              BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014


     3.3.4.1. 2 OSS/OSW personnel will produce mission planning weather outlook forecasts
     of weather conditions and impacts NLT 2000L daily for all missions listed in ePEX.
     3.3.4.2. The mission planning weather outlook forecasts will be posted to the 2 OG
     Share Point. Mission planning weather forecasts will be updated, if required.
     3.3.4.3. Planning weather will contain the following data:
         3.3.4.3.1. Takeoff weather forecast: Temperature, surface wind, pressure altitude,
         ceiling/visibility, temperature deviation, solar/lunar data, and climb wind forecasts.
         3.3.4.3.2. Enroute/Target Area Weather: Continental United States (CONUS)
         forecast surface prognostic chart, flight level winds, hazards, clouds, and ceiling and
         visibility forecasts.
  3.3.5. Flight Weather Briefing (FWB):
     3.3.5.1. FWB services are available to aircrews in the weather station, (Building 6402,

         3.3.6.1.13. An example MEF is included as Attachment 8.
     3.3.6.2. MEF Amendment:
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                            25


          3.3.6.2.1. Forecasters will conduct MISSIONWATCH on all MEFs and will only
          amend when weather hazards (based on mission profile) are observed or expected and
          was not forecast or was forecast and is no longer occurring or expected.
          3.3.6.2.2. Once crews are airborne, 2 OSS/OSW will provide all updates to the
          appropriate Supervisor of Flying (SOF) who will relay information to aircrew(s).
3.4. Mission Debriefs:
   3.4.1. All aircrews receiving an initial weather briefing from 2 OSS/OSW will provide 2
   OSS/OSW with a post-mission debrief describing weather conditions encountered, accuracy
   of forecast, and impact of the weather and weather forecasts on mission effectiveness IAW
   AFI 11-2B-52V3_BARKSUP1, B-52 Operations Procedures.
   3.4.2. Mission debriefs may be conducted in person, telephonically, via SOF, electronically
   or in writing using the Mission Weather Feedback form.
3.5. Flight Weather Briefing Support to Transient Aircraft:
   3.5.1. Provide service IAW posted duty priorities for walk-in requests from transient
   aircrews. When transient or staged aircrews request briefing support, 2 OSS/OSW will:
      3.5.1.1. Provide a briefing or update an existing briefing form as time and resources
      allow. EXCEPTION: Refer flight weather briefing requests for AMC, USAFE, and
      PACAF integrated flight-management (IFM) missions to the appropriate IFM weather
      support agency (e.g. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW, 21 OWS, and 17 OWS respectively).
      WFs may provide access to meteorological satellite imagery, take off data, and other
      perishable weather data for IFM crews upon request, but will refer the aircrew to their
      supporting IFM weather organization for weather updates to the actual mission package.
      3.5.1.2. If unable to provide a briefing or update an existing briefing, provide contact
      information for the supporting OWS and direct the aircrew to Airfield Operations-
      provided terminals for online access to weather support. Assist aircrew as time permits.
3.6. Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs):
   3.6.1. 2 OSS/OSW is capable of providing TDAs for the employment of electro
   optic/infrared weapon systems and laser target designation systems.
   3.6.2. Detailed mission-specific TAWS products will be routinely produced whenever
   aircrews request and provide critical mission profile data to run the TAWs program.
   3.6.3. Output includes, but is not limited to, lock-on ranges, optimum viewing direction,
   thermal crossover times, target/background temperatures, hot-cold list, and solar/lunar data.
   3.6.4. Non-routine TAWS requests require six hour notification at the appropriate
   classification level via web, phone, or in person.
3.7. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Support:
   3.7.1. 2 OSS/OSW serves as the primary point of contact (POC) for the 2 BW to coordinate
   all tailored official forecasts provided to BAFB units/agencies with each official National
   Hurricane Center (NHC) update.
 26                                               BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014


   3.7.2. 2 OSS/OSW uses the NHC tropical cyclone forecasts (Atlantic), Joint Typhoon
   Warning Center (Pacific), and Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product issued by the 26
   OWS to tailor and produce mission forecast products. Tailoring may include specific local
   effects such as terrain or relative position to the storm.
   3.7.3. 48 – 72 hour outlooks contain a high degree of uncertainty and are for planning
   purposes only. No deviation from the forecast position, track, movement, maximum wind
   speed, or intensity trend obtained from the above agencies is authorized.
   3.7.4. 2 OSS/OSW will initiate SWAP, if required.
3.8. Space Weather:
   3.8.1. General: 2 OSS/OSW will provide space weather support in support of BAFB mission
   requirements. The 2d Weather Group at Offutt AFB produces and disseminates all space
   weather analysis, forecasts, warnings, and advisories. 2 OSS/OSW does not have any in-
   house capability to create these products, but only interprets and relays them in order to
   effectively integrate into the mission planning/execution processes.
   3.8.2. The following space weather products are available upon request:

Terms:
Air Force Weather Web Service— USAF internet weather information system which constantly
provides worldwide and forecast data to support aircrews and military forecasters. Hosted by the
Air Force Weather Agency at Offutt AFB.
Cooperative Weather Watch— Established between 2 OSS/OSA and 2 OSS/OSW. The
occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions which could affect flight safety or be
critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources is of primary concern.
Desired Lead—time- The amount of advance notice a supported agency desires before the onset
of a particular weather phenomenon.
Forecast Weather Advisory— A weather advisory issued when the customer requires advance
notification of a particular weather phenomenon.
Eyes Forward— Exploitation Unit forecasters are the eyes forward for the technicians in the
Operational Weather Squadron and integrate weather radar data, meteorological satellite
imagery, lightning detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems (vertical profilers,
PIREPs, etc.) to create an integrated weather picture and near-term trend forecasts for the OWS.
METAR Observation— A routine scheduled surface weather observation. It contains a report
of wind, visibility, runway visual range, present weather, sky condition, temperature, dew point,
and altimeter setting. In addition, significant remarks are appended to the METAR observation.
Meteorological Watch— The process of actively comparing observed weather conditions with
those forecasted and updating forecasts with the latest information.
Mission Execution Forecast— A customized weather product providing terrestrial and space
weather data and forecasts for a specific mission, or set of missions. It fully integrates aerospace
weather with the customer’s tactics, weapon systems, environmental sensitivities of equipment,
and other operational requirements.
MISSIONWATCH— The monitoring of aerospace weather for a specific mission (e.g. ground,
air, or space) and informing supported agencies when unforecast mission-limiting phenomena
could impact operations.
Observed Weather Advisory— A weather advisory issued when the customer does not require
advance notification of a particular weather phenomenon.
Operational Weather Squadron— An organization comprised of management, technician, and
training personnel responsible for providing regional weather support. Their mission is to
produce theater-scale tailored weather forecast products and services to customers within their
area of responsibility.
BARKSDALEAFBI15-101 14 MARCH 2014                                                                43


Pilot to Metro Service— A UHF radio service (227.4 MHz) that allows aircrews to contact
weather personnel for updated weather conditions and to pass on significant flight weather
reports.
Pilot Report— A report of observed flight weather conditions usually passed to weather
personnel through the PMSV radio.
Severe Weather— Established weather conditions deemed to pose a hazard to flight safety,
property, or life. Examples include but are not limited to tornadoes, large hail, heavy snow/rain,
and damaging winds greater than or equal to 50 knots.
SPECI Observation— An unscheduled observation taken when specific criteria are met. All
SPECIs shall be made as soon as possible after the relevant criteria are observed.
Target Acquisition Weapons Software— A tactical decision aid incorporating weather
parameters that provides an array of graphical and numerical output to aircrews (e.g. lock-on
range, transmissivity, thermal cross-over, etc.)

Terminal Aerodrome- The area within a 5 NM radius of the center point of the runway
complex.
Terminal Aerodrome Forecast— A 24-hour forecast for cloud layers, prevailing visibility,
weather obstructing visibility, surface winds, altimeter setting, and icing and turbulence from the
surface to 10,000 ft mean sea level (MSL).
Thunderstorm— Atmospheric condition consisting of lightning, thunder and heavy
precipitation. Potential for gusty winds, hail, severe turbulence, icing, and wind shear is implied.
Vicinity— The area between five and ten SM of the center point of the runway complex.
Weather Advisory— A special message, disseminated primarily via JET, which notifies
supported BAFB units of established weather conditions that require certain protective actions by
various base agencies.
Weather Warning— Special notice, disseminated primarily via JET, provided to supported
BAFB units giving them advance notification (with sufficient time for protective actions) when
weather conditions within the forecast area exist, are imminent, or are highly likely to occur of
such intensity to pose a hazard to personnel, resources, and property.
Weather Watch— Special notice, disseminated primarily through JET, provided to supported
BAFB units alerting them to the potential for weather conditions within the forecast area during
the specified valid time of such intensity to pose a hazard to personnel, resources, and property.
The weather watch can be thought of as a “heads up,” at which time agencies need to consider
implementing required protective actions should a subsequent weather warning be issued.
Watches normally precede a weather warning.

    WEATHER WARNING, WATCH AND ADVISORY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

A5.1. General. Due to limited staffing and the time-critical nature of this information, 2
OSS/OSW personnel cannot individually notify every agency requiring WWAs; hence, the
application of a notification chain that exploits installation command and communications
channels. All units receiving these weather products must be involved in a continuous program
of evaluation and improvement of the weather dissemination system, including inter-unit
dissemination. Each base agency notified is encouraged to have their own notification matrix for
their respective agencies. Agencies must make certain that weather dissemination procedures
ensure those needing information receive it.
A5.2. Notification. WWAs will flow from the 26 OWS to 2 OSS/OSW, Command Post, ATC,
and 2 OSS/OSAA via JET or via phone. The Command Post will contact other base agencies
depending on the situation and based on the Command Post notification tree. Individual
commanders of units in need of weather information are responsible for having their units listed
in the notification chain maintained by the Command Post. For 2 OSS/OSW issued observed
weather advisories, 2 OSS/OSW will also contact the 26 OWS. Figure A5.1 displays the
notification chain.
