   3.3.3. Because the basic or minimum mission crew is considered augmented, the mission
   crew FDP is 24 hours. When mission requirements dictate, consider adding additional
   mission crewmembers as necessary to maximize in-flight rest opportunities. EXCEPTION:
   The maximum FDP for mission crews with less than the applicable crew complement
   outlined in Table 3.2 is 16 hours.
       3.3.3.1. Mission crewmembers may have their FDP terminate in flight. These mission
       crewmembers will cease performing official in-flight duties. Per AFI 11401, paragraph
       3.3.5, these crewmembers will log other time during periods of crew rest or sleep.
   3.3.4. Transition training (i.e., multiple patterns, approaches, landings, and/or A/R training)
   will be completed during the first 12 hours of the flight crew’s FDP. In no case will this
   prevent missions from continuing to the final destination once training events are
   accomplished. Mission crew FDP does not affect the events associated with this paragraph.
   EXCEPTION: Transition training may be completed during the first 16 hours of the flight
   crew’s FDP for aircrew evaluation or initial qualification sorties. The OG/CC can approve
   the ACs request to extend transition duty day to 16 hours.
 14                                                              AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


3.4. Crew Rest. Consult AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, for additional guidance.
   3.4.1. En Route Crew Rest and Ground Times.
       3.4.1.1. Non-alert missions should be planned with a minimum of 17 hours ground time
       between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff. If extended post flight duties are
       anticipated, ground time will be adjusted to allow a full 12 hours crew rest prior to the
       start of the next FDP. When possible, flight crews should be afforded crew rest times in
       excess of the minimum to give crews the opportunity to overcome the cumulative effects
       of fatigue while flying consecutive days or transiting time zones.
   3.4.2. Alert/PSM Missions. Once provided the opportunity for at least 8 hours uninterrupted
   rest, an aircrew member may start a new FDP. The crew rest period for alert is defined as the
   period when official alert duties are not being performed. Crew rest is free time, which
   includes time for meals and rest.
       3.4.2.1. Mission crews may perform a maximum of 12 hours ground Alert duty after
       flight and/or deadheading, provided they are afforded the following:
          3.4.2.1.1. Eight hours continuous rest in the 10 hours immediately preceding the
          ground duty Alert period.
          3.4.2.1.2. Each applicable mission crew member will be provided an on-board bunk
          or passenger seat for their crew rest.
          3.4.2.1.3. After this ground Alert duty, mission crew members will be afforded a full
          12 hours crew rest before subsequent FDP can begin.
          3.4.2.1.4. Mission crew members will be relieved as soon as suitable replacements
          are crew-rested IAW 3.4.2.
   3.4.3. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). Aircrew members returning to home station should
   be given sufficient time to recover from the cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
   personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination and/or the completion of official
   mission/alert duties.
   3.4.4. Crewmembers should receive 1 hour (maximum of 96 total hours) for every 3 hours
   off-station and/or on alert. If PMCR is awarded, crews will not enter pre-mission crew rest
   for another mission until the post-mission crew rest period is complete. Waiver authority is
   the SQ/CC.
3.5. Standby Force Duty.
   3.5.1. Reserve Standby Force. As required, the 1 ACCS shall posture aircrews as a Reserve
   Standby Force able to show for duty 1 hour after notification. Unless approved otherwise by
   the 1 ACCS/DO, the Reserve Standby Force will remain in the local Omaha area (able to
   respond to work within 1 hour from time of notification). The 1 ACCS/DO may adjust
   response times as necessary for mission accomplishment.
   3.5.2. Telephone Standby Crews. As required, the 1 ACCS shall posture aircrews as a
   Telephone Standby Force ready to enter pre-mission crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked
   aircrews will be legal to show for duty 12 hours after entering crew rest.
3.6. Mission Alerting Procedures.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        15


   3.6.1. Crewmembers will normally self-alert for all missions and trainers.
   3.6.2. When necessary, the 1 ACCS/DO may set a crew legal-for-alert (LFA) time to
   provide greater flexibility for mission accomplishment. Crews with a LFA time will not
   show for duty until notified. Crews will show NLT 1 hour after notification.
3.7. Aircrew Release Policy. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
   3.7.1. Reserve and Telephone Standby Crews. Release time will be 0730 the first duty day
   after assuming standby duty or as established by the 1 ACCS/DO.
   3.7.2. Aircrews with a LFA Time. If not ―alerted‖ within 12 hours of the LFA time, the crew
   will be released or reentered into crew rest.
   3.7.3. Local Trainers.
       3.7.3.1. If a training sortie cannot depart within 4 hours of the scheduled takeoff time due
       to maintenance, weather or other events, the crew should be released. The AC, with
       1ACCS/DO concurrence, may extend the takeoff window as necessary for mission
       accomplishment.
   3.7.4. Operational Missions (Alert, PSM, SSM, etc). Aircrew release will be as directed by
   the 1 ACCS/DO in conjunction with the NAOC OTC.

                                           Chapter 5

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Duty Stations. Both pilots and the engineer shall be in their seats during critical phases of
flight. Only one pilot or the flight engineer will be absent from his/her duty station at any one
time. When additional crewmembers are on board, the jump seat should be occupied to assist the
crew in avoiding other aircraft, birds, etc., during critical phases of flight. Crewmembers will
notify the pilot prior to departing their assigned primary duty station.
5.2. Takeoff and Landing Policy. A qualified AC will occupy one of the pilot seats during all
takeoffs and landings. The designated AC is not required to occupy a primary position, but still
retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
5.3. Seat Belts. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Crewmembers will
have seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
5.4. Cockpit Communications Policy. Recorded aircraft crew communications represent
official communications, and aircrew should be aware they have no expectation of privacy.
   5.4.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and mission
   accomplishment during taxi, critical phases of flight, and flight below 10,000 feet MSL.
   5.4.2. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying will periodically announce his/her intentions during
   critical phases of flight and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures.
       5.4.2.1. In addition to the mandatory calls found in the flight manual, the pilot not flying
       (PNF) will make calls when passing transition level, approaching 1000 feet above or
       below any assigned altitude, VVIs in excess of 1000 ft/min below 500 feet AGL, and
       during landing when the pitch exceeds 8 degrees.
       5.4.2.2. Any crewmember will announce an altitude deviation of 200 feet or more, an
       airspeed deviation of 10 knots or more, or any potential terrain, obstruction or traffic
       clearance problem.
   5.4.3. Aircraft Interphone. All crewmembers will monitor interphone except when crew
   duties or physiological needs dictate otherwise. Hot-mic (if available) will be monitored to
   the max extent possible, but may be toggled off for short periods when its use impedes the
   accomplishment of essential duties. Crewmembers will notify the AC prior to checking off
   interphone and/or hot-mic.
   5.4.4. Command Radios
       5.4.4.1. The flight deck requires at least one UHF command radio plus guard, for all
       flights.
       5.4.4.2. The PNF normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
       5.4.4.3. A designated crewmember will monitor the primary command radio unless
       directed otherwise, during all phases of flight.
       5.4.4.4. A flight deck crewmember will monitor guard regardless of the primary radio.
   5.4.5. Datalink, SATCOM voice, and Airline Operational Control (AOC).
 18                                                              AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


      5.4.5.1. The PNF and/or navigator will normally accomplish all datalink correspondence
      with ATC. Verify the content and accuracy of all downlinks with the other pilot or
      navigator prior to sending a downlink to ATC.
      5.4.5.2. Prior to sending any ATC downlink report containing aircraft position, altitude,
      altitude climbing/descending to, airspeed, or routing information, the PNF will coordinate
      with the navigator to ensure the Flight Management System (FMS) is providing accurate
      information for the report.
      5.4.5.3. The navigator (or PNF) will normally monitor, reply to, and initiate all
      SATCOM voice, AOC, and Air Traffic System datalink communications.
   5.4.6. HF Communications. Perform HF radio ground checks prior to takeoff when HF radio
   use may be required for ATC or C2 communications.
5.5. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
   5.5.1. Runway. The minimum required runway length and width is 7000 feet by 147 feet.
      5.5.1.1. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, takeoffs should be initiated from the beginning
      of the approved usable portion of the runway. However, pilots may accomplish
      intersection takeoffs provided the aircraft gross weight, takeoff obstructions, weather,
      runway condition, etc, allows for a safe takeoff and departure. The decision to make
      intersection takeoffs rests solely with the AC.
      5.5.1.2. Contaminated Runways. During operations on runways partially covered with
      snow or ice, base takeoff computations on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared
      portion of the runway. A minimum of 50 feet either side of centerline should be cleared.
      If the runway cannot be cleared, compute takeoff data based on the un-cleared portion up
      to 50 feet either side of centerline.
      5.5.1.3. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or
      authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
      takeoff. Departure end overruns may also be used for landing (as needed) if stressed and
      authorized.
      5.5.1.4. RCR Limitations. Minimum RCR for takeoff and landing is the lowest RCR
      depicted in the T.O. 1E-4B-1-1 (never less than 4). When no RCR is reported, aircrews
      should consider the runway wet when there is sufficient water on the surface to cause a
      reflective glare or when rain is falling.
   5.5.2. Taxiways. Minimum required taxiway width is 74 feet.
      5.5.2.1. RCR Limitations. Aircrews will not taxi on surfaces where the reported RCR is
      less than 4 without approval from the 55OG/CC, or the NAOC OTC on off-station HHQ
      missions. Aircrews should use caution during periods of degraded RCR since taxiways
      and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the runway.
5.6. Wind Limitations. Airfields will be considered below minimums for takeoff and landing
when winds (including gusts) are greater than:
   5.6.1. Maximum wind (any direction) – 50 knots.
   5.6.2. Tailwind – 10 knots.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                          19


   5.6.3. Crosswind – 30 knots, uncorrected for RCR.
5.7. Aircraft Taxi Speeds. Aircraft taxi speeds should be limited to 10 knots during turns of 90
degrees or more and 30 knots when taxiing straight ahead. Aircrews should adjust speeds
accordingly for turns between 0 and 90 degrees.
5.8. Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage Avoidance.
   5.8.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers. With wing
   walkers, avoid obstructions by at least 10 feet. Use extreme caution when scanning from
   inside the airplane since wing tip and tail growth in turns make determination of actual
   clearance very difficult.      EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and
   Movement on the Ground, aircraft may taxi without marshallers/wing walkers at home
   station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet
   clearance from any permanent obstacles.
5.9. Seat Belt/No-Smoking Sign Policy.
   5.9.1. To enhance "Seat Belt" sign credibility and compliance, the flight crew turns the sign
   on just prior to taxi and off just after the parking brake has been set for parking. The seat belt
   sign will also be used during air refueling, anytime the landing gear is extended, and at the
   discretion of the AC.
   5.9.2. In order to comply with AFI 11-202V3 guidance, the ―No Smoking‖ sign policy and
   the use of portable electronic devices on E-4B aircraft is as follows:
       5.9.2.1. The ―No Smoking‖ sign will be turned on prior to engine start and will remain
       illuminated anytime the aircraft is operating below 10,000 feet MSL. Prior to takeoff, the
       FA will make a PA announcement directing all personnel to turn off and stow all non-
       approved portable electronic devices and cellular phones.
       5.9.2.2. When the aircraft descends through 10,000 feet MSL and the ―No Smoking‖
       light illuminates, the FA will make a PA announcement directing all personnel to turn off
       and stow all non-approved portable electronic devices.
       5.9.2.3. Anytime in flight when the ―No Smoking‖ sign is illuminated, all personnel will
       turn off and stow all non-approved portable electronic devices. EXCEPTION: During
       air refueling, portable electronic devices may be used above 10,000 AGL with the ―N
       Smoking‖ sign illuminated unless otherwise directed.
5.10. Aircraft Door Operations.
   5.10.1. Taxi operations will not be conducted with a cargo door or hatch open.
   EXCEPTION: EWO operations.
   5.10.2. Door operators will be selected from qualified personnel and assigned a specific door
   by their section supervisor. Table 5.1 specifies E-4B door assignments by section. Personnel
   assigned duties as a door operator will:
       5.10.2.1. Complete the E-4B emergency egress training before being designated a door
       operator.
       5.10.2.2. Identify doors armed in the automatic mode of operation with the appropriate
       flag.
 20                                                               AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


       5.10.2.3. Utilize the ―buddy system‖ when opening any of the main deck doors except
       during actual emergency egress situations.
       5.10.2.4. Immediately inform the FA of any problems arming/disarming any door.

Table 5.1. Aircraft Door Assignments.
                     Door                                             Section

 5 Left, 5 Right                                  Communications
5.11. Maximum Number of Personnel Aboard Aircraft.
   5.11.1. Normal. Unless directed otherwise by the JCS or HQ/ACC and approved by
   ACC/A3, the maximum number of personnel (aircrew and passengers) authorized aboard the
   aircraft using a standard configuration is 111 people
   5.11.2. Emergency. The emergency authorization is for planning purposes and must be
   consulted in the event of emergency evacuation. In this situation, the maximum number of
   personnel (aircrew and passengers) is 330 with a standard configuration. However, the
   passenger load may be varied depending on the urgency of the evacuation, the distance to be
   flown, and the overall condition of the aircraft. Weight and space limitations for survival
   equipment and personal baggage are not considered in these numbers.
5.12. Communication Systems Hazard Area Procedures.
   5.12.1. Do not open the flight deck escape hatch when SHF/UHF SATCOM and/or
   MILSTAR are in use.
   5.12.2. At no time will MX personnel enter an area level with or higher than the blue line on
   the fuselage without first verifying with communications personnel that the SHF/UHF
   SATCOM and MILSTAR systems are operating in receive only, not operating, or are pointed
   at an angle not to interfere with planned maintenance. This area includes walking on the
   wings outboard of the inboard engines.
   5.12.3. The SHF SATCOM antenna should not normally be operated below an angle of +10
   degrees. If operation below +10 degrees is required, the SHF operator will coordinate with
   maintenance to ensure personnel are outside the hazard distance associated with the power
   output.
   5.12.4. MILSTAR operators should not normally transmit below an angle of +5 degrees
   from the horizon. If operation below +5 degrees is required, operators will coordinate with
   maintenance to ensure personnel are outside the hazard distance of 217 feet. This restriction
   includes personnel in and around surrounding aircraft.
   5.12.5. The HF radio may be transmitting anytime the aircraft is on alert. Precautions will be
   taken to avoid contact with the aircraft surfaces when the HF radio is transmitting.
5.13. Aircraft Electrical Power Transfers. With mission equipment operating, all power
transfers for the mission busses will be via Non Interruption of Power Supply (NIPS). If a NIPS
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                      21


transfer cannot be made, coordinate with Technical Control prior to any switching or restoring of
electrical power. Power transfer is extremely critical and must be done properly to avoid mission
equipment damage. If power transfers cannot be made via NIPS, FEs and/or maintenance
personnel will ensure that Technical Control has ample time to power down critical equipment
prior to any electrical configuration changes. Clearly communicate the power needs of the
aircraft to the ground crew.
5.14. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.14.1. Aircrews should burn down fuel versus jettison unless safety of flight dictates.
   Except in emergencies, notify ATC or a flight service facility of intentions, altitude, and
   location prior to jettison. If available, aircrews should use designated jettison areas except
   when safety of flight would be compromised. Never jettison fuel in a circular descending
   pattern.
   5.14.2. For NAOC and HHQ missions, the OTC may authorize fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement dictates immediate recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or
   aircrew (alert force exercises are not considered urgent). The 55 OG/CC may also approve
   fuel jettison for training missions when an urgent operational requirement exists to expedite
   recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have been exhausted.
5.15. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. Aircrews will comply with guidance found in 55 WG BASH Plan
91-212. On operational NAOC missions the OTC is the BASH waiver authority.
5.16. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures,
and the appropriate ACC supplement. Aerial events must be sanctioned and individually
approved by the appropriate military authority and the FAA.

6.9. Briefing Requirements.
   6.9.1. Aircraft Commander Briefing. Cover all applicable items on the 55th Wing-approved
   Briefing Certificate to ensure safe and effective mission accomplishment. Items expanded on
   in the standards guide and understood by all participants may be briefed as ―standard.‖ All
   flight crew members will attend this briefing unless excused by the AC. The communications
   team Flight Commander and NCOIC (or their representatives) will also attend (as applicable)
   and back-brief team members on all pertinent items. If more than 72 hours have elapsed
   between the initial brief and scheduled takeoff, the AC shall re-brief any items deemed
   critical for safe mission accomplishment.
   6.9.2. Pre-Alert (NAOC 4-Hour) Briefing. All Flight crew members should attend if
   possible. As a minimum, the AC and the CCO will attend a NAOC pre-alert briefing. If, due
   to mission requirements, the AC and/or CCO are unable to attend, a designated
   representative will be sent who will brief the on-coming crew prior to assuming alert. The
   AC and CCO will, in-turn, brief all remaining crewmembers.
   6.9.3. Pre-Deployment Briefing. The NAOC/CC and/or 1 ACCS/CC (or designated
   representative) will conduct specialized briefings for aircrews deploying on PSMs/SSMs.
   This briefing is used to advise aircrews of the latest mission changes, deployment issues,
   intelligence situation, and review other applicable information. All primary and alternate
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                       25


   crewmembers should attend the briefing. The DO or AC may exempt crewmembers from this
   briefing on a case-by-case basis. If excused, crewmembers will be back briefed by the AC or
   section head before deployment.
   6.9.4. Weather Briefings.
       6.9.4.1. Home Station Departures. Weather briefings may be faxed, emailed or posted on
       the Offutt weather website, as requested by the aircrew. When faxing weather request,
       aircrews will call to verify receipt, clarify any questions they have, and receive any
       critical updates that may arise. Verbal briefings are authorized for flights.
       6.9.4.2. En Route Stops. Aircrews should obtain weather information from the local
       military weather flight, Offutt AFB weather flight, or the Operational Weather Squadron
       (OWS) responsible for weather support at their location. If adequate services are not
       available and the crew cannot contact their home station weather flight or an OWS,
       obtain weather through any means available prior to mission departure (i.e. Jeppesen
       Dispatch, etc).
6.10. Flight Plan Verification. Computer Flight Plans (CFP) are the official source of
performance, navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. Each mission
segment should use the best wind data available.
   6.10.1. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure. CFP
   wind data should be considered inaccurate if the average wind for a route segment exceeds
   either 30 degrees in direction or 25 knots in speed from forecast conditions.
   6.10.2. As a minimum, CFPs will be optimized for winds and include the route of flight,
   headings and airspeeds, winds, en route times, air refueling information, and fuel log. Best
   range airspeed should be used for general flight planning unless mission requirements dictate
   otherwise.
6.11. Jeppesen Flight Planning Procedures. Jeppesen Dispatch services will only be utilized
on HHQ missions.
6.12. Departure Planning. Comply with T.O. 1E-4B-1-1, AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1,
Instrument Flight Procedures, and this chapter for departure planning. Regardless of the type of
departure flown, review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedures, Standard
Instrument Departure (SID), instrument approach plates, NOTAMS, Global Decision Support
System (GDSS) Giant Report (if available), and suitable terrain charts including obstacles. Pilots
and Flight Engineers will check IFR SIDS at all departure and destination airfields to ensure that
all published climb gradients can be met for forecast weather conditions. Crews will be trained
and certified prior to flying Special Departure Procedures (SDP).
6.13. Departure Alternates.
   6.13.1. When a departure alternate is required, the aircraft must be capable of maintaining
   the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the
   alternate using One Engine Inoperative (OEI) performance criteria.
6.14. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will
be IAW AFI 11-202V3.
6.15. Adverse Weather.
 26                                                                AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


   6.15.1. Turbulence.
       6.15.1.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence will be avoided.
       Additionally, avoid areas of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
       turbulence.
          6.15.1.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies
          to, or what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for
          their route of flight. The E-4B is a category II aircraft for turbulence.
   6.15.2. Icing.
       6.15.2.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing will be avoided. If
       moderate icing is encountered, every effort will be made to exit the icing conditions.
   6.15.3. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0oC may cause ice or
   frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When the aircraft requires de-icing/anti-icing prior to
   takeoff refer to the 1E-4B(II)-1 guidance.
       6.15.3.1. In all cases, a visual inspection of the aircraft will be made within 5 minutes of
       takeoff. Aircrews can assume that the condition of the horizontal stabilizer is the same as
       the wing provided a visual inspection of the entire aircraft is made just prior to taxi.
          6.15.3.1.1. Aircrews may utilize FAA published holdover times when the aircraft is
          de-iced with other than Type I de-icing fluids.
   6.15.4. Thunderstorm Avoidance.
       6.15.4.1. To minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or departing
       airports in areas of convective activity, aircrews will maintain at least 5 NM separation
       from heavy rain showers. Aircrews can further minimize exposure to thunderstorm
       hazards by attempting to maintain VMC and avoiding areas of high lightning potential
       (clouds within + 5,000 feet of the freezing level or + 8oC of the freezing level).
       6.15.4.2. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms,
       advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
       thunderstorms, or underneath a thunderstorm’s anvil cloud.
       6.15.4.3. Alert Missions. To the maximum extent possible, alert aircraft will avoid
       ground alert at locations where severe thunderstorms are forecast. Aircrews should
       consider launching when severe thunderstorms are observed within 50 NM, but will
       launch without delay when thunderstorms are observed to be on course to the airfield.
       When in doubt, ACs should error to the conservative side and launch since thunderstorms
       develop quickly, with little or no warning in an unstable atmosphere, thus providing little
       to no window for safe escape.
       6.15.4.4. Consideration should be given to accomplish TRT takeoffs in areas where wind
       shear and thunderstorm activity is forecast.
6.16. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic-based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors that impact safe
mission accomplishment. ACs will accomplish the 1 ACCS-approved ORM worksheet during
preflight mission planning activities.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                      27


Section 6C—Preflight

6.17. AFTO Forms 781 Series. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before performing any
preflight duties or checks. An Exceptional Release (ER) must be signed before flight. A
maintenance (MX) officer, superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the ER, but the
AC may sign if one of these individuals is not available. Ensure that the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel
Identaplate and Air Card are aboard the aircraft. Verify a current MX dash-six inspection is
completed and annotated on the AFTO form 781H.
6.18. FMS Flight Plan Accuracy. Either a pilot or another navigator will verify all waypoint
data inserted into the FMS by the navigator. Check both the coordinate information and the
distances between waypoints against the flight plan. This information will also be checked
against the IFR flight plan filed with ATC.
6.19. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.19.1. Refueling and De-fueling. Qualified FEs are authorized to refuel or de-fuel the
   aircraft. Refer to Chapter 12 of this instruction for further guidance
       6.19.1.1. Alert Missions. Standard fuel load is 180,000 pounds regardless of location.
       Fuel loads may be adjusted as mission requirements dictate provided the change is
       approved by the OTC and/or CCOC and aircraft performance factors allow it.
       6.19.1.2. Hot Refuel Procedures. Hot Refueling is authorized on alert missions with one
       or more engines operating. The AC and senior crew chief on duty will determine the need
       for hot refueling and ensure that all operations are accomplished in a safe manner and
       IAW applicable T.O. guidance.
           6.19.1.2.1. Only essential personnel are authorized on-board the aircraft during hot
           refueling. All NAOC OT personnel may remain with their classified material on
           board the aircraft.
           6.19.1.2.2. Both the base and the refueling team must be certified and current. The 1
           AMU maintains a list of certified and current bases in the Hot Refuel Book.
           6.19.1.2.3. Refueling will not begin until sufficient fire coverage is present. If
           sufficient fire coverage cannot be maintained, hot refueling will be terminated. Do
           not resume operations until sufficient fire coverage is restored.
   6.19.2. Potable Water.
       6.19.2.1. Operational Missions. Service 400 gallons of fresh potable water (4 full tanks).
       Drain and re-service water every 72 hours.
       6.19.2.2. Training Sorties. Service a minimum of 200 gallons of fresh potable water
       when outside temperatures allow or as directed by the 1 ACCS/DO (for example, TWA
       sorties). Drain and re-service water every 72 hours.
   6.19.3. Hot liquid oxygen (LOX) Servicing Procedures. Hot LOX servicing is authorized on
   alert missions with one or more engines operating. The AC and senior crew chief on duty
   will determine the need for hot LOX servicing and ensure that all operations are
   accomplished in a safe manner and IAW applicable T.O. guidance.
 28                                                                   AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


       6.19.3.1. Only essential personnel are authorized on-board the aircraft during hot LOX
       servicing. No personnel are permitted in the forward lower lobe. All NAOC OT
       personnel may remain with their classified material on board the aircraft.
       6.19.3.2. Limit maintenance activities to the physical replacement of avionics
       components inside the aircraft.
       6.19.3.3. Hot LOX servicing will not begin until sufficient fire coverage is present. If
       sufficient fire coverage cannot be maintained, servicing will be terminated. Do not
       resume operations until sufficient fire coverage is restored.
   6.19.4. Tire Rotation. Although a 72-hour tire rotation is not mandated, T.O. 4T-1-3,
   Inspection, Maintenance Instructions, Storage and Disposition of Aircraft Tires and Tubes,
   recommends a three-day tire rotation cycle. If the aircraft has not been moved in several days
   and tire flat-spotting is suspected, sufficient taxiing to roll out tire flat spots is required prior
   to attempting a high-speed taxi and/or takeoff.
6.20. Life Support Requirements.
   6.20.1. Oxygen. Minimum liquid oxygen (LOX) quantity is 200 liters with 4 operable LOX
   converters and 150 liters with 3 operable LOX converters. The AC may authorize lower
   amounts.
   6.20.2. . Meals Ready to Eat (MREs). Fifty seven cases will be pre-positioned aboard the
   alert aircraft.

Section 6D—Departure

6.21. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are considered on time if the aircraft is airborne
within -30 to + 15 minutes of scheduled takeoff time per ACCI 21-165, CAF: Aircraft Flying
and Maintenance Scheduling Procedures.
6.22. Cabin Security Procedures for Takeoff and Landing. The following procedures should
be followed prior to all takeoffs and landings:
   6.22.1. The FA should assure all carry-on luggage and supplies are secured as soon as
   possible after boarding personnel. Ensure all personnel carry-on baggage is stowed to prevent
   a hazard during emergency landings. Notify the AC when excessive amounts of baggage
   preclude safe stowage.
   6.22.2. The FA will confirm the anticipated taxi time with the AC prior to commencing any
   cabin service before takeoff.
   6.22.3. The FA will notify the cockpit crew that the cabin is secure prior to being seated for
   takeoff to include number of souls on board.

Section 6E—En Route

6.23. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor Flight
Management System (FMS) performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of
navigation capability that degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control
center (ARTCC). Use the following procedures for flight progress:
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                         29


   6.23.1. Oceanic, Trailing Wire Antenna, air refueling, communication exercise, and
   Category I routes will be entered in an approved mission planning system and displayed
   using a moving map. If a new route of flight is received, enter the new route of flight when
   able. When the approved mission planning system and/or moving map are unavailable,
   crews will use an appropriate navigational chart to plot and record route data.
   6.23.2. Another pilot or navigator will verify all waypoint data inserted into the Flight
   Management System.
   6.23.3. When approaching each waypoint on a Category I or over-water route, recheck
   coordinates for the next waypoint and crosscheck actual versus planned fuel remaining.
   6.23.4. Operations in Territorial and International Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and Area
   Planning (AP) for further guidance).
       6.23.4.1. Territorial Airspace. Includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic
       waters, inland waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Consistent with
       international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12 NMs, however, specific
       guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits which differ from this standard.
       Do not enter the territorial airspace of another nation without the proper diplomatic
       clearance.
       6.23.4.2. International Airspace. This includes all airspace seaward of coastal states’
       territorial seas. Military aircraft may operate in such areas free of interference or control
       by the coastal state. A Flight Information Region (FIR) does not reflect international
       borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without
       approval of the adjacent country, provided the AC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
       6.23.4.3. Aircrews should not amend diplomatically approved entry point(s) when on a
       flight plan route which takes them from international airspace into territorial airspace.
       6.23.4.4. In the event an ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or
       attempts to negate existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal
       response will be to advise ATC that the aircraft will continue to the planned destination
       as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety
       of flight is paramount in determining mission continuation.
       6.23.4.5. Aircrews should not normally fly "due regard" routings unless specifically
       required by the mission directives. Operating under "due regard" obligates ACs to be
       their own ATC agency and separate their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational
       requirements dictate, ACs may exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft.
       Comply with the guidance found in FLIP General Planning. Aircraft will return to
       normal air traffic services as soon as practical.
6.24. Special Qualification Airspace.
   6.24.1. E-4B aircraft are approved for operations in RNP airspace down to RNP-0.3, RVSM
   and FANS airspace. The E-4B is Stage-3 Noise Compliant.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.25. Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs).
30                                                                AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


  6.25.1. Aircraft Category. The E-4B is designated a category D aircraft. Instrument approach
  RVR/visibility and, if required, ceiling minimums will be as published for a category "D"
  aircraft. If the approach speed will exceed 165 knots, the minimums for category "E" will be
  used.
  6.25.2. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be certified to
  conduct ILS PRM approaches. Comply with the following operational procedures:
     6.25.2.1. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
     6.25.2.2. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
     6.25.2.3. All breakouts from the approach will be hand flown. Autopilots will be
     disengaged when a breakout is directed.
     6.25.2.4. Should a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Resolution Advisory
     (RA) be received, the pilot shall immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA
     requires deviating from an ATC clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as
     practical. While following an RA, comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout
     instruction unless the pilot determines safety may be compromised by following ATC
     directions.
  6.25.3. Multiple airfield/aircraft systems and equipment must be operational for Cat II/IIIa
  approaches. Consult AFM 11-217VI, Instrument Flight Procedures, T.O. E-4B(II)-1, and
  applicable AFIs for additional guidance.
     6.25.3.1. Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, aircrews should comply with the
     following guidance to maximize aircraft performance during Cat II/IIIa approaches:
         6.25.3.1.1. Intercept localizer at an angle of 45 degrees or less.
         6.25.3.1.2. Intercept localizer not less than 8 miles from the runway threshold.
         6.25.3.1.3. Capture localizer at a speed of Vref + 40 knots or less.
         6.25.3.1.4. Capture glide slope at or above 1500 feet AGL.
         6.25.3.1.5. Stabilize aircraft on localizer and glide slope not later than the outer
         marker or as soon as possible after passing the FAF.
         6.25.3.1.6. Sterile Approach Path. Advise and get confirmation from ATC that you
         are flying a coupled and/or auto-land approach.
         6.25.3.1.7. Check aileron and rudder trim prior to engaging the autopilot for the
         approach.
         6.25.3.1.8. Maintain symmetrical thrust on all four engines throughout the approach.
         Note: If any of these conditions cannot be met and weather conditions permit, the
         pilot may elect to hand-fly a Cat II approach with three or four engines operating.
     6.25.3.2. ―RA-NA‖ Minimums. CAT II approaches without an RA setting for Decision
     Height (DH) are authorized. In this case, the terminology ―RA-NA‖ will be annotated in
     the minimums section of the IAP. This denotes irregular terrain changes that affect RA.
     DH must be determined solely from the barometric altimeter.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        31


   6.25.4. Weather Below Minimums. If an aircrew has begun the en route descent or published
   approach and subsequently determines the weather is below approach minimums (reported or
   observed), the pilots must not deviate from the last ATC clearance until obtaining a new or
   amended clearance. CAT I approaches may be continued to the missed approach point and
   land, if the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing and the runway environment is in
   sight.
6.26. Border Clearance/Customs. Refer to Foreign Clearance Guide, DoD                       FLIP
documentation and host nation procedures for border clearance/customs procedures.
   6.26.1. Normal Operations:
      6.26.1.1. The 1 ACCS is normally responsible for border clearance of all aircraft. When
      staff support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the AC.
      6.26.1.2. The AC may delegate duties to ground personnel or to other designated
      crewmembers, but he/she retains ultimate responsibility. The AC will ensure the
      following:
          6.26.1.2.1. Crew members and passengers possess current passports and valid visas,
          when required.
          6.26.1.2.2. Crew    members     and   passengers   possess   current   certificates   of
          immunization.
          6.26.1.2.3. Depart or enter the United States through an air base where border
          clearance can be obtained.
          6.26.1.2.4. Obtain border clearance for aircraft passengers, crew and baggage, if
          required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign area.
   6.26.2. Procedures for US Entry:
      6.26.2.1. En route, the FA or designated crewmember will distribute personal customs
      declarations to all passengers and crew members. The FA or designated crewmember will
      also brief passengers and crew members on customs regulations and prepare and compile
      necessary border clearance forms for the FA’s signature.
      6.26.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency or airfield contact at the base of intended
      landing of any change in ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as
      possible after landing.
      6.26.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an
      aircraft(which has landed in the United States for customs clearance) proceed to another
      base in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs
      inspection of passengers and crew until arrival at the off-load station and saves
      intermediate off-loading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The
      permit to proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance
      must be completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
      intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination unless
      required by an emergency situation or directed by the controlling authority.
      6.26.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
      normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
 32                                                                AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


       passengers or crew members unless absolutely necessary for safe recovery of the airplane
       or the preservation of life and property. Do not unload until approved by customs and
       agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
       initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
       or until all crew and passengers complete final border clearance.
   6.26.3. Inspections of E-4B aircraft by foreign officials:
       6.26.3.1. Follow US Air Force policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the
       Foreign Clearance Guide, General Information, Chapter 3. In substance, this policy states
       that US military aircraft are immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including
       customs and safety inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, ACs must be aware of
       and adhere to any specific Foreign Clearance Guide provisions for individual countries.
       6.26.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews will follow
       the direction of the NAOC OTC. ACs should also consider the following guidance:
          6.26.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement from
          the AC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not
          subject to search without consent of US Air Force headquarters or the US Department
          of State officials in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite
          manner so as not to offend foreign authorities who may honestly, but mistakenly,
          believe they have authority to search US Air Force aircraft.
          6.26.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the AC should make
          every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact US Air Force headquarters
          or the appropriate embassy officials. The AC should then notify these agencies of the
          foreign request by the most expeditious means available and follow their instructions.
          6.26.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
          notification to US Air Force headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the AC should
          indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
          time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
          so.
          6.26.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
          way on board an aircraft, the AC should state that he protests the course of action
          being pursued and that he intends to notify both US Air Force headquarters and the
          appropriate American Embassy of the foreign action. The aircraft commander should
          not attempt physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to US Air
          Force headquarters and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The AC should
          escort foreign authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
       6.26.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive materials or equipment.
       Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified Foreign Clearance Guide
       supplements.
6.27. Insect and Pest Control. ACs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, the FCG, or as directed by higher
headquarters. Certify the spraying on a CF 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        33


Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on-board. The only exception is when the FCG
mandates it (for example, Australia).
   6.27.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent, USAF
   approved or equivalent, to spray the aircraft. Use the following guidelines:
       6.27.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
       sprayed.
       6.27.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel,
       baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other
       similar spaces.
       6.27.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the aircraft
       after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation
       openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use, spray prior
       to boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10 minutes after
       dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board.
   6.27.2. Spraying Times. Spray the aircraft for 118 seconds unless longer periods are
   specified for the country being transited.
   6.27.3. Responsibility of Aircraft Commander In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent
   infestation of the aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 facility, base operations, or
   airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
6.28. Aircraft Recovery Away From Main Operating Base (MOB).
   6.28.1. When an aircraft is scheduled to land at a base other than home station, crew chiefs
   should accompany the aircrew. In the absence of E-4B maintenance personnel (i.e. weather
   divert), the flight crew is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent
   mission taskings.
   6.28.2. In all cases where qualified maintenance specialist assistance is not available, the
   flight crews will ensure compliance with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
6.29. Maintenance Debrief. Complete the AFTO Form 781 series after each flight. After
landing, crewmembers will debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft.
   6.29.1. ACs or Flight Attendants will provide one copy of the AFTO Form 781, ARMS
   Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Log to maintenance personnel.
   6.29.2. Turn in Offutt Form 791, Aerial Receiver In-Flight Receipt Log, AF Form 664,
   Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log, AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and
   Maintenance Document, AFTO FORM 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
   Document, and the Offutt Form 73, Engine Condition Sheet, to the maintenance debriefer.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.30. Engine Maintenance Runs. Aircrews are authorized to perform engine maintenance runs
which cannot be performed on the Echo Row and/or by maintenance personnel. When an aircrew
is required, the following procedures apply:
 34                                                                 AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


   6.30.1. AMU should notify 1 ACCS/DO no later than 14 hours prior to the scheduled engine
   run time. This provides 2 hours to organize a crew and 12 hours for pre-mission crew rest. A
   minimum of two pilots and one engineer are required for all engine runs.
   6.30.2. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and preparations
   for the engine run prior to crew show time and document the AFTO 781 series appropriately.
   6.30.3. Engine run crews will comply with the following guidance:
      6.30.3.1. Prior to departing for the aircraft, notify command post, SOF, Maintenance
      Operations Center (MOC) and base operations about the engine run. CP will, in turn,
      notify Central Security Control (CSC). Aircrews will also pre-coordinate with the control
      tower if runway use is required.
      6.30.3.2. Verify all engine run parameters/requirements (type of run, power settings, etc)
      with the maintenance supervisor prior to starting engines.
      6.30.3.3. Follow normal aircrew checklist procedures. Flaps will be set to the UP
      position.
      6.30.3.4. Power Settings Above Ground Idle. Operate symmetrical engines with the
      parking brake set for all power settings above ground idle. For engine runs at or above
      the takeoff power range, aircrews may open the AURAL WARN circuit breaker to
      eliminate nuisance warnings. When opened, crews shall pay special attention to all
      visual warning indications for the engine and APU. Delay opening the circuit breaker
      until just prior to commencing the engine run and close it immediately upon completion.
      6.30.3.5. Terminate engine run at the first indication that damage to the aircraft or base
      equipment may occur.
   6.30.4. Military Power Assurance (MPA) Runs. Engine runs are normally accomplished at
   MPA settings with no bleed air or electrical loads on the associated engine. These runs
   normally use an N2 power setting instead of N1. MPA runs may be performed on any Echo
   Row parking spot up to maximum power.
   6.30.5. Takeoff Rated Thrust (TRT) Runs. TRT runs must be accomplished on the active
   runway. When runway use is required, engine runs should be de-conflicted with the local
   flying schedule. Position the airplane into the wind (as best as possible) at approximately the
   mid-field position.
   6.30.6. If the aircraft is not ready 4 hours after show time, the crew will be released.
6.31. Life Support Equipment Documentation. The Flight Attendant or the AC designated
representative will:
   6.31.1. Ensure appropriate serviceable protective clothing, life support, and survival
   equipment for the entire mission is aboard the aircraft before departing home station.
   6.31.2. Review, sign, and date the AFTO 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to
   ensure all required protective clothing and life support and survival equipment have been
   certified as installed by aircrew life support. Ensure appropriate number and type of life
   preservers are aboard for over-water missions if carrying children and/or infants.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                   35


  6.31.3. Equipment Discrepancies. Aircrews discovering defective or missing equipment will
  document the discrepancy in the AFTO 781A. Normally, do not sign the AFTO 46 until the
  discrepancy has been corrected. If the mission will continue without the missing equipment,
  annotate the discrepancy on the AFTO 46 when signing and dating the form.
  6.31.4. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
  annotated on the AFTO 46, notify the maintenance supervisor. Extra equipment is normally
  stored in the main deck Technical Control/Rest Area overhead compartment. Excess
  equipment will be removed by life support personnel during the next life support inspection.
 36                                                                AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
hijacking of E-4B aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking),
AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and specific ACC security publications contain additional
guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed
aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. All E-4B alert aircraft are Protection Level (PL) 1 resources. All other E-4Bs are
PL 2 resources. Aircraft security at non-United States military installations is the responsibility
of the controlling agency.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                             37

       mishap, but in the judgment of the reporting individual, needs to be emphasized in the
       interest of mishap prevention.
   8.4.2. Report mishaps as soon as possible to the 1 ACCS/DO and as directed on the OAFB
   3404. When transiting en route USAF bases, ACs should contact the local Flight Safety
   office to comply with local reporting requirements and seek any additional assistance
   required. Retain a copy of all relevant information, and turn it into the home station safety
   officer upon mission completion.
   8.4.3. Required Information. Complete all appropriate areas of the form. Provide as much
   detail as possible.
8.5. Report Violations, Unusual Events, or Circumstances. ACs shall document events that
require them to deviate from AFI 11-202V3 (unless waived by competent authority) or alleged
navigation errors (include over-water position errors over 24NMs, border, or ATC violations).
   8.5.1. Use OPREP-3 reporting procedures contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting,
       8.5.1.1. When notified of a navigation position error, the AC (or agency that receives
       initial notification) shall document the circumstances surrounding the incident (using
       report format below) and ensure C2 agents submit an OPREP-3.
   8.5.2. ACs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission
   to appropriate ACC agencies. Most events require C2 agents to forward OPREP reports to
   higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the
   incident to the appropriate C2 agency.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                     39


                                            Chapter 9

                                     TRAINING POLICY

9.1. Touch-and-Go Landings. The following limitations apply:
   9.1.1. Comply with all flight manual procedures and restrictions.
   9.1.2. Runway.
      9.1.2.1. Minimum runway length is 8,000 feet.
      9.1.2.2. RCR shall be 15 or greater.
      9.1.2.3. Do not accomplish touch-and-go landings on slush, ice, or snow covered
      runways. EXCEPTION: When conditions are ―patchy‖ (ice or snow), touch-and-go
      landings may be accomplished provided RCR is 9 or greater and minimum runway length
      is 9,000 feet.
   9.1.3. Maximum crosswind component is 20 knots.
   9.1.4. Accomplish all touch-and-goes under the direct supervision of an IP/EP in one of the
   pilot seats. There is NO limitation on accomplishing touch-and-go landings while MEP or
   passengers are onboard. No emergency procedures may be accomplished while MEP or
   passengers are onboard. AFI 11-401 contains other restrictions based on the type of flight
   profile.
9.2. Short-Field Landings. Practice short-field landings are authorized under the following
conditions:
   9.2.1. Maximum gross weight and brake energy level is 580K lbs and 25 million foot pounds
   respectively. Pilots and FEs will discuss braking techniques, brake energy levels and cooling
   requirements as part of their approach briefing.
   9.2.2. Limited to final full stop landings.
9.3. Full Stop/Taxiback Landing Procedures. Full stop/taxiback landings are authorized
under the following conditions:
   9.3.1. Compute a brakes-on speed which will require the dissipation of less than 20M ft-lbs
   of brake energy. If manual braking is used, the runway length and condition must allow
   withholding brake application until the computed brakes-on speed is reached and still permit
   a safe stop.
   9.3.2. Brake energy is cumulative (landing, taxi, possible abort on subsequent takeoff, etc).
   Compute the total brake energy accumulation possible. Crews will use a limit of 50M ft-lbs
   for this calculation.
   9.3.3. Brake Cooling. The landing gear will remain down on the subsequent takeoff. No
   further full stop/taxibacks will be accomplished until the required brake cooling time has
   been observed and actual brake cooling is confirmed at the FE station.
   9.3.4. The crew must carefully consider the possibility of exceeding the brakes’ stopping
   capability during a high-speed abort on the subsequent takeoff. The brakes are effective to
   approximately 58M ft-lbs of brake energy.
 40                                                              AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


9.4. Simulated In-Flight Emergency Procedures. Simulated emergency procedures will be
conducted IAW AFI 11-202V3 and this instruction. If an actual emergency situation develops,
practice emergency procedures will be terminated. The following limitations apply:
   9.4.1. Pilots will alert all crewmembers prior to simulating emergency procedures.
   9.4.2. Compound emergencies will not be practiced.
   9.4.3. Simulated Engine-Out Limitations.
       9.4.3.1. Do not simulate engine failures on takeoff below 100 feet AGL.          EFTOC
       emergencies will be accomplished below 650,000 gross weight.
       9.4.3.2. Maximum crosswind component is 20 knots.
   9.4.4. Simulated emergencies will be supervised by an IP/EP occupying one of the pilot
   seats.
9.5. Category II/IIIa Training. Practice ILS Cat II/IIIa approaches may be flown provided
actual weather conditions are at or above Cat I minimums. Aircrews will use the following
guidance:
   9.5.1. Cat I Certified Facilities. Use a DH of 100 feet RA.
   9.5.2. Cat II/IIIa Certified Facilities. Use published approach minimums, but no lower than
   50 feet RA.

                                          Chapter 11

                               NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter consolidates unique navigation procedures into one location.
11.2. Mission Planning.
   11.2.1. The AC or designated representative shall verify proposed routes and flight
   altitudes/levels provide proper terrain clearance and meet FLIP and FCG requirements.
   11.2.2. Flight Plan. Cross-check the CFP planned route against the route of flight entered on
   the DD 175, Military Flight Plan or DD 1801, DOD International Flight Plan, and the
   approved diplomatic clearance.
   11.2.3. Navigator Station. The navigator who prepares or accepts the flight plan will remain
   on duty at the navigator's station during departure and will brief the relieving navigator. The
   navigator ensures all required fuel computations are accurate and complete, and, in addition,
   will ensure ramp fuel load is compatible with mission requirements.
11.3. Flight Charts. Prior to flight, navigators will plot oceanic, TWA, air refueling,
communication exercise, and Category I routes on an appropriate navigational chart. If a new
route of flight is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the chart when able. This
requirement may be met using paper charts or electronic charts produced with approved mission
planning software. If electronic charts are used in flight and become unavailable, navigators will
transition to paper charts. Required symbology and chart annotations will be in accordance with
AFPAM 11-216, Air Navigation and the flight manual.
11.3.1. Annotate the following information on the chart:
       11.3.1.1. Flight plan course depicting reporting points, names and/or coordinates.
       11.3.1.2. On A/R missions, plot the ARIP, ARCP, turn, and exit points.
       11.3.1.3. Restricted, warning, and prohibited airspace located within 50 NM of the
       intended route of flight. Note: Special use airspace need not be annotated on the chart
       when the appropriate FLIP en route chart is used.
       11.3.1.4. Highest terrain and/or obstacle within 50 NM of the intended route of flight.
       11.3.1.5. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) for all flights conducted off airways
       which penetrate the ADIZ on the inbound leg.
   11.3.2. Multiple legs on the same chart are permissible when practical.
11.4. Navigator Procedures.
   11.4.1. General Procedures. General navigation (fixing requirements) begins upon
   completion of the published departure or when cleared off SID/on course by the departure
   control agency and ends when the pilot or air traffic controller assumes navigation to the
   terminal facility.
   11.4.2. Navigation Log. Recording flight information on an in-flight log is required during
   general navigation. ACC-approved or locally-produced forms are acceptable for use. The
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                          45


   navigator’s log is the official record of the flight and will be signed by the navigator and
   maintained for a period of 90 days after the flight.
       11.4.2.1. Obtain a position at either the planned departure point or the final level off
       point not to exceed takeoff time plus 30 minutes.
       11.4.2.2. As a minimum, record position time, compass or true heading, true airspeed,
       groundspeed, and drift at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes. Record a position for
       unplanned turns of 20 degrees or more off compass heading.
       11.4.2.3. Terminate fixing requirements and record a position when one of the following
       occurs: arrival at the initial point of a STAR, arrival at a high IAF, or start of the enroute
       descent.
       11.4.2.4. Navigation log entries are not required for minor heading changes, ATC
       vectors, etc. In-flight information/fixing requirements are not applicable during departure,
       holding, air refueling (rendezvous, orbits and anchor patterns), weather avoidance,
       airway/jet route navigation, trailing wire orbits, mission rendezvous, and upon initiation
       of penetration and approach. The position of the airplane, however, must be monitored at
       all times using all available aids.
       11.4.2.5. Log entries may be delayed, postponed, or altered due to operational
       requirements or restrictions, unscheduled rendezvous or anchor air refueling, weather
       deviations requiring immediate action, or EMCON limitations. Pacing is vital to ensure
       navigation accuracy. During periods when log entries are not required, every effort will
       be made to verify and cross-check navigation systems.
       11.4.2.6. Dead Reckoning. The primary means of navigation is dead reckoning (DR).
       DR positions may be manual or automatic. Use automatic DR to the maximum extent
       possible. Manual DR is not required when at least one INS or GPS is operating
       satisfactorily.
       11.4.2.7. Fixing. The primary method of fixing is the FMS. For normal FMS operation
       (Actual Navigation Performance [ANP] is less than the Required Navigation
       Performance [RNP] for the airspace being flown), the FMS position will be cross-
       checked by radio aid or radar (when available) and the compass magnetic heading. INS
       track or true heading will be cross-checked with the flight plan or manually computed
       data.
   11.4.3. Training Sorties. Navigation legs should be planned for a minimum duration of 30
   minutes. Do not plan navigation legs (1) during departure, prior to level off and prior to the
   planned departure point, (2) during A/R or when within the trailing wire area, or (3) during
   arrival, from 10 minutes prior to the planned en route descent point, initial position of a
   STAR, or high altitude IAF until landing.
11.5. High Latitude Operations. Operations when flying north of 70 degrees and south of 60
degrees latitude require thorough study and understanding of all instrument approach and
INS/FMS procedures as well as heading displays. The AC will decide whether headings will be
magnetic or true oriented and ensure all crewmembers understand what type heading is being
displayed on the HSI. Consider provisions for conversion of heading systems from magnetic to
true and contingency plans for INS failures. Refer to operations manuals for specific procedures.

   Aircraft, a ground cord, headset, and the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate are on board
   the aircraft for all flights.
   12.4.2. IDG Warm Up. In order to reduce the number of IDG failures, a 3-minute warm up
   period is required (regardless of OAT) prior to putting the IDG on-line. Timing will begin
   once the engine has stabilized at idle power. EXCEPTION: Alert response or emergencies.
12.5. Authority to Clear a Red X. Flight engineers are not normally authorized to clear a Red
X. If a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance
personnel are not available to clear it, a qualified flight engineer on scene may obtain
authorization to clear the Red X from the home station MXG/CC or designated representative, in
accordance with T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
Policies, and Procedures. Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X.
EXCEPTION: Without restriction, the flight engineer may clear Red Xs for engine covers, pitot
covers, and gear pins when qualified maintenance personnel are not available.
12.6. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. This policy is designed for support of the
aircraft and its mission while away from home station.
   12.6.1. All qualified FEs will have a working knowledge of airplane-specific refueling
   procedures. Although FEs are normally not required to refuel the aircraft, they are
   authorized to accomplish these duties when maintenance personnel are not available.
   EXCEPTION: FEs will not perform Concurrent/Hot Refueling, De-fueling, Multiple Fuel
   Servicing, or Battery Power Only Refueling unless assisting a maintenance refueling team.
   12.6.2. Aircrews will only refuel in cases where maintenance support is not readily available
   and the mission would be delayed. However, crewmembers may augment maintenance
   refueling teams as required.
 48                                                                  AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


   12.6.3. If ground support personnel are not available, the AC may designate other qualified
   crewmembers to assist the FE with refueling duties (safety/fire observer, etc). In these cases,
   the FE will act as the refueling team supervisor. Other crewmembers will be thoroughly
   briefed on their respective duties.
   12.6.4. Comply with all applicable dash-2 aircraft T.O.s and T.O. 00-25-172, Ground

   refueling operations.
   12.6.5. Procedures. Use the ―Control from the Flight Engineer’s Station‖ method of
   refueling. The FE should remain at the FE station to control the refuel and monitor aircraft
   power. To facilitate a smooth refuel operation, the FE should ground the aircraft, position
   and bond the stand, hook-up and bond the initial hose to the SPR, hook up headsets, and
   accomplish any other preparation details prior to refuel operations as appropriate.
   12.6.6. Unless environmental conditions dictate otherwise, the primary emergency exit will
   be the air stairs.
   12.6.7. Transient Alert (TA) Assistance. TA personnel are authorized to refuel the E-4B
   provided they have the proper refueling checklists. The FE will coordinate the refueling
   process and assist the refuel supervisor during the refuel.
12.7. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program. The flight engineer will complete the AFTO
Form 141, Individual Aircraft Tracking Program (IATP) Flight Log, on every flight. This form
documents usage data for the E-4B.
   12.7.1. Use the instructions on the form.
   12.7.2. Turn in completed forms during the MX debrief. These forms will be checked by the
   E-4B Flight Log manager. The log manager will forward completed forms on a quarterly
   basis to OC-ALC/ENFOC, 7803 Arnold Street, Bldg 3, Suite 128, Tinker AFB, OK, 73145-
   9145.
12.8. Engine Condition Sheet. Engine Condition Sheet program data becomes a permanent
part of an aircraft engine's history. In order to track potential engine failure, make every effort to
record engine performance data on the Offutt Form 73 (engine coupon) or approved electronic
versions for each sortie. Discontinue procedure any time safety would be compromised. Turn in
completed coupons or electronic versions during the MX debrief. Ensure all coupons are hand-
carried to home station when returning from depot modifications or maintenance inputs. The
following conditions must be achieved in order to capture valid data:
   12.8.1. Power must be stabilized for 5 minutes at cruise speed with the autothrottle off prior
   to recording data.
   12.8.2. Do not change conditions (power setting, altitude, airspeed, etc) once the FEs begin
   recording data. Conditions must remain constant for a minimum of 12 seconds to capture
   valid data.
   12.8.3. Turbulence. Light turbulence is permissible.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                  49

                       FLIGHT ATTENDANT (FA) PROCEDURES

13.1. General. This chapter outlines FA procedures not found in the aircraft flight manuals or
elsewhere in this volume.
13.2. Responsibilities. The FA is the direct contact between the US Air Force and the
passenger. The FA primary duties include meal preparation, door and air stair operation, border
clearance requirements, passenger instruction on the use of emergency equipment and the
conduct of emergency egress when necessary. Additionally, FAs act as the AC’s cabin
representative, provide cabin service and maintain cabin cleanliness throughout the mission. On
multi-FA crews, the first FA acts as FA supervisor and delegates specific duties and
responsibilities to each FA.
13.3. FA Standards.
   13.3.1. When making contact with the party, FAs will wear the appropriate uniform as
   prescribed by the 1 ACCS/DO. Comply with all FCG requirements.
   13.3.2. Any problems encountered with passengers during the mission (i.e. mistreating the
   aircraft, disorderly behavior, etc.) should be forwarded to the contact through the AC for
   appropriate action.
   13.3.3. FA Augmentees. Occasionally, multiple mission taskings create shortages in the FA
   crew force. In these cases, the 1 ACCS/DO may elect to augment missions with other
   qualified E-4B crewmembers, FAs from SAM aircraft, and/or upgrading E-4B initial
   qualification FAs. In all cases, augmentees must be under the supervision of an instructor FA
   and will not perform FA-specific flight manual procedures (aircraft preflight, etc).
13.4. Pre-Mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Contact the AC or navigator for itinerary times. Determine all wet/dry ice and bottled
   water requirements at this time.
   13.4.2. Meal Service. The first FA or designated representative will make contact with the
   mission POC to determine cabin service requirements and obtain necessary funds. When
   funds are not available prior to mission execution, obtain funds from the in-flight funds
   custodian. Complete all portions of AF 4084, Air Passenger Specialist Mission Planning
   Worksheet. Procure needed supplies (food, beverages, special requirements, etc.) and retain
   all receipts.
   13.4.3. The first FA will conduct an FA brief and assign all FA positions and duties. During
   the pre-mission briefing, the AC and first FA should clearly define aircrew duties during
   emergency situations. This includes, but is not limited to, egress, cabin smoke and/or fire, hot
   brakes, and emergency passenger handling duties. During emergency situations, the highest
   qualified FA should assume command of the emergency and direct all FA actions.
   13.4.4. Prior to flight, FAs will place one copy of the completed flight orders and EAL in the
   location designated by the 1 ACCS/DO.
13.5. Pre-Flight Duties.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        51


   13.5.1. Perform applicable preflight or en route checklists. When more than one FA is
   assigned to a mission, this preflight may be accomplished by one FA or divided into zones,
   as necessary. Check that applicable passenger information cards are properly distributed.
   13.5.2. Upload food and fleet items and stow as necessary. If aircraft availability and
   maintenance scheduling allows, consideration should be given to loading non-perishable
   items the day prior to departure.
   13.5.3. Prepare meals as required. Focus of preflight duties will be directed toward
   passenger service to ensure completion prior to station time and not inhibited by crew meal
   service.
   13.5.4. Coordinate receipt of passenger manifests.
   13.5.5. Coordinate passenger baggage loading and security.
13.6. Passenger Handling.
   13.6.1. Do not unduly alarm passengers by relaying details of abnormal conditions not
   readily discernible by passengers.
   13.6.2. Inform the AC immediately of passenger problems such as those involving unusual
   requests or bizarre or disruptive behavior.
13.7. Border Clearance. Certain forms for border clearance are required by customs,
immigration, public health and agriculture. The FA is the custodian for these and other required
forms and will ensure adequate quantities are aboard the aircraft prior to takeoff. The first FA
should be familiar with the Foreign Clearance Guide and AMC Border Clearance Guide
requirements for applicable destinations and will distribute forms to the crew and passengers, as
necessary, for completion prior to landing.
13.8. En Route and Post-Flight Duties.
   13.8.1. FAs will provide cabin and meal service while maintaining the highest standards of
   safety and cabin discipline. During critical phases of flight or turbulence, ensure all loose
   items are stowed. Suspend cabin service if necessary.
   13.8.2. Operational Missions. Meal service will be provided on all operational missions as
   directed by the 1 ACCS/DO, OTC, AC, and/or mission directives.
   13.8.3. Training Missions. Meal service may be offered for all sorties when at least 45
   minutes of cruise time is available (TWA sorties, navigation legs, etc). In all other cases,
   meal preparation will be at the discretion of the FA. Instructor FAs may also use local
   trainers to instruct meal preparation. When meal service is not practical, the FA will order
   and pick up meals from the flight kitchen for crewmembers who desire a meal.
   13.8.4. Attend to flight crew needs when passenger service duties permit.
   13.8.5. Assist with passenger deplaning and baggage offload or transfer. Ensure passengers
   do not leave baggage unattended around aircraft or personal items on the aircraft.
   13.8.6. FAs are responsible for aircraft cleanliness. They are also responsible for ensuring
   that all food items are properly stored and aircraft is mission ready before departing home
   station. All perishable items not used will be disposed of in appropriate trash containers prior
   to leaving the aircraft. Follow host nation rules IAW FCG and border clearance guide.

  Ensure all passenger cabins, galleys and lavatories are cleaned. Blankets and pillowcases
  should be changed (if needed) at en-route stops and upon return to home station.
  13.8.7. Arrange or procure food and beverages required for subsequent mission legs. When
  purchasing wet/dry ice from vendors who will not accept an AF 15 or credit card, obtain
  funds from the in-flight funds custodian and provide him/her with a receipt. The in-flight
  funds custodian, in turn, will submit a SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement of Expenditures.
  13.8.8. Under no circumstances will either perishable or non-perishable items purchased for
  the official party be consumed by crewmembers or ground support personnel, or taken from
  the airplane for personal use.

                                       FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. This chapter provides fuel planning policy and procedures for E-4B operations.
It is designed to assist aircrews in planning any and all operational mission or trainers. Fuel
conservation and optimization will be a priority for all missions. Aircrews and planners should
make every effort to reduce fuel consumption on every sortie without compromising flight safety
or training objectives.
14.2. Cruise Speed. Normal cruise speed for the E-4B is 350 KIAS/0.84 M, whichever is less.
Use high speed cruise only when needed to satisfy the requirements of the DV or mission. Do
not exceed flight manual limitations or FAR and/or host nation aircraft speed restrictions.
14.3. Fuel Planning. Fuel planning requirements are in Table 14.1
   14.3.1. Safety. ACs retain the final authority for and will ensure that all factors are
   considered when determining the minimum required ramp fuel load (RRFL). Factors to
   consider include mission requirements, routing (oceanic, mountainous region, etc), one
   engine inoperative (OEI) performance capability, ETPs, destination/alternate weather, and en
   route hazards and alternate suitability.
   14.3.2. As a minimum, RRFL will consist of all fuel required for engine start, taxi, warm-up,
   APU operation, takeoff, climb, cruise, en route reserves (if required), alternate/missed
   approach (if required), descent, approach, landing, holding (minimum required fuel reserve)
   and any other mission-essential fuel requirements (alert, PSM, etc).
       14.3.2.1. Do not carry extra fuel for convenience, but when solid ORM and safety of
       flight considerations call for it, do not hesitate to mitigate risk/safety factors by adding
       fuel.
       14.3.2.2. Refueling at En Route Stops. When fuel availability is limited or not available,
       mission requirements preclude refueling, or refueling would be detrimental to mission
       accomplishment, extra fuel may be added to RRFLs.
   14.3.3. Alternate Fuel. As a minimum, alternate fuel will include fuel for a flight from the
   intended destination to the furthest alternate aerodrome at optimum altitude and long range
   cruise speed. When holding is required, in lieu of an alternate at a remote or island
   destination, compute holding for 2+00.
   14.3.4. If decompression would cause descent to an altitude resulting in fuel consumption
   exceeding planned fuel, add fuel to recover at a suitable airfield from the ETP at the
   appropriate altitude. This is not required if the aircraft can recover to a suitable airfield at FL
   250 at long range cruise (LRC) speed from ETP.

                                           (Note 1)
Holding                         30,000 lb Compute 45 minutes of fuel using endurance or
                                minimum holding charts. When the alternate is located in
                                           Alaska or latitudes greater than 59 degrees
                                           north/south, compute 1+15 of fuel. Holding fuel
                                           should be computed at the alternate. When holding in
                                           lieu of an alternate is required, use 2+00 fuel.

                          AIR REFUELING (A/R) PROCEDURES

15.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for air refueling the E-4B. Crews will also
comply with all procedures and restrictions in the flight and air refueling manuals.
15.2. Limitations. The following limitations apply:
   15.2.1. Air refueling will not be conducted under the following conditions:
       15.2.1.1. A/R Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect
       capability means the boom operator cannot initiate an immediate disconnect. If A/R must
       be accomplished, receivers will use emergency boom latching (EBL) procedures
       published in the flight manual and must initiate all disconnects.
       15.2.1.2. Emergency Boom Latching. Failure of the receiver’s signal amplifier has
       occurred. If A/R must be accomplished, the receiver must initiate all disconnect since
       tanker disconnect capability is inoperative.
       15.2.1.3. Engine-Out. Either the tanker or receiver has less than the full number of
       engines operating
       15.2.1.4. The tanker is unable to retract the landing gear.
       15.2.1.5. Conditions are encountered that, in the opinion of either AC or the boom
       operator, result in marginal control of either aircraft or the boom.
       15.2.1.6. Tanker or receiver experiences any flight control problem. Note: If A/R must
       be accomplished, aircrews will not approach closer than 1 NM until it is positively
       ascertained that A/R operations are safe to conduct. Note: Boom operator and receiver
       pilot must coordinate all actions as required by applicable directives and checklists when
       making A/R contacts during the situations listed above.              EXCEPTION: Fuel
       emergency situations, Single Integrated Operations Plan (SIOP), and when executing
       HHQ-directed taskings. Limit contacts to the minimum number required to complete
       mission.
   15.2.2. Reverse-flow A/R. Accomplish only during a tanker fuel emergency situation.
   15.2.3. Emergency Separations/Breakaways. Follow procedures in IAW T.O. 1E-4B(II)-1.
   Once the situation has stabilized and the receiver is well clear, notify the taker and coordinate
   clearance back to pre-contact.
   15.2.4. Receiver A/R Training for Unqualified Pilots. In-flight training will be accomplished
   under direct IP supervision. IPs will occupy one of the pilot seats no later than pre-contact
   until post A/R.
   15.2.5. Seat Swaps. If a receiver seat change takes place, move back to at least 100 feet in
   trail of the tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the
   entire tanker until the seat change is complete.
   15.2.6. Weather Limitations.
 56                                                                AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


      15.2.6.1. Turbulence. Terminate refueling if the actual turbulence encountered creates a
      situation where safe refueling operations are not assured.
      15.2.6.2. Visibility. Do not approach closer than 1 NM unless you have visual contact
      with the tanker(s). Discontinue refueling if in-flight visibility is insufficient to continue
      safe refueling operations.
15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure while
conducting A/R shall continue flight in accordance with the following procedures.
   15.3.1. Discontinue refueling. EXCEPTION:          EWO operations and/or bona fide fuel
   emergencies.
   15.3.2. Rendezvous. Maintain a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation until reliable
   radio communications are established.
15.4. Altitude Reservations. An ALTRV is an authorization by one of the central altitude
reservation functions (CARF, EUCARF, PACMARF, CARU) or, under certain circumstances,
the appropriate ARTCC/CERAP for airspace utilization under a given set of conditions. Air
refueling on operational missions often utilizes an ALTRV. ALTRVs may include all or only
portions of the intended route of flight.
   15.4.1. PICs will ensure an ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution.
   15.4.2. Aircraft must depart within the assigned AVANA (ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not
   Airborne) time for the purpose of providing separation between altitude reservations.
   Normal AVANA time is 30 minutes. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time,
   coordinate with the C2 authority as soon as possible.
   15.4.3. Aircraft on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and areas specified in
   the approval. An ALTRV APVL authorizes the aircraft to climb or descend as specified.
   Controllers are not required to issue a climb or descent clearance for the various flight
   segments. They may, however, request that the pilot advise them prior to initiating an altitude
   change.
   15.4.4. In a non-radar environment, the aircraft shall advise ATC if actual fix timing will be
   more than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate.
   15.4.5. File flight plans (1801 or DD175) containing ALTRVs IAW FLIP GP. Include the
   name of the ALTRV in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV requests or approvals
   do not eliminate the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic clearance or file flight plans.

   16.7.9. Personnel will immediately inform their supervisor of any condition that could
   adversely affect the mission or compromise crew and/or aircraft safety. Problems should be
   elevated to a level appropriate to the perceived impact on the mission. Any problem serious
   enough to be elevated to the OT, condition that may affect aircraft status, or non-routine MX
   will be coordinated through the AC first. The AC will, in turn, notify the OTC and/or CCOC.
   16.7.10. ATC Procedures.
       16.7.10.1. NAOC operational priority and ―Bust Out‖ procedures are defined in Federal
       Aviation Administration Order (FAAO) Joint Order (JO) 7610.4P, Special Operations,
       and FAAO JO 7110.65U, Air Traffic Control.
       16.7.10.2. ACs will keep a copy of the IFR flight plan on file with the local base
       operations flight (en route locations) or in the 1 ACCS Mission Planning Room (home-
       station operations). The DD Form 175 should contain the remark ―NAOC routes and
       altitudes may apply‖ in the REMARKS section.
16.8. Mission Changes.
   16.8.1. Aircraft Status Changes. The AC will inform the 1 ACCS/DO via secure means
   anytime the aircraft status changes.
   16.8.2. Unscheduled Movements. ACs will notify the 1 ACCS/DO via secure means when
   any unscheduled alert move will take place.
16.9. Weather Information. It is the responsibility of the host base weather flight (or
command post if there is no local base weather shop) to pass all weather advisories, watches and
warnings without delay to the NAOC watch officer. The requirements below are those Watches,
Warnings, and Advisories that have been coordinated.
   16.9.1. Advisories. Issued for visibility of less than one mile.
   16.9.2. Watches and Warnings. Issued for hail (of any size), winds 35 knots or greater,
   freezing precipitation, heavy snow, moderate/severe thunderstorms, lightning, and tornadoes.
16.10. Alert Force Exercises.
   16.10.1. Limitations. The AC shall immediately notify the CCOC and 1 ACCS/DO when
   any condition exists which would preclude executing alert force movement exercises
   (weather, maintenance, airfield limitations, crew rest, etc). Aircrew may reference NAOC
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                         61


   Manual 9-3 for a list of weather factors or other conditions which affect an alert force
   movement exercise.
   16.10.2. Safety. Minimum launch timing is required and thus, necessitates close
   coordination between all personnel and agencies. Safety remains paramount in all exercises.
   The AC is the final authority in determining when conditions warrant a greater safety margin.
   Immediately terminate exercises when any unsafe condition develops which presents a
   hazard to the aircrew and/or aircraft.
   16.10.3. Boarding the Aircraft. Proceed in an expeditious and safe manner to the aircraft.
   Board via the forward lower lobe air-stairs and accomplish all appropriate procedures and
   checklists. To enhance safety, respond to the aircraft with items properly secured and stowed.
   16.10.4. A NAOC battle staff member will deliver the AC's notification card to the navigator
   or other flight crewmember as soon as possible.
   16.10.5. FA will get a verbal or visual signal from the CCOC or Operations Superintendent
   that all required personnel are on-board the aircraft. The FA will then pass this information to
   the flight-deck.
   16.10.6. Taxi. Comply with the restrictions of paragraph 5.10.1. Limit taxi speeds to those
   listed in paragraph 5.7.
   16.10.7. Simulated Takeoff. To simulate takeoff, momentarily advance the throttles to TRT
   then smoothly retard the throttles to idle. Reverse thrust should not be activated.
   16.10.8. Exercise Timing Sheet. The navigator will record alert exercise timing by denoting
   key times on the timing sheet. At the completion of the exercise, the AC will validate
   exercise timing with the NAOC watch officer and sign the NAOC exercise timing sheet.
   16.10.9. Termination Procedures. Terminate all exercises by broadcasting, ―This is (call
   sign), Terminate, Terminate, Terminate‖ on the appropriate radio frequency. Command post,
   tower, ground, UHF guard frequencies may be used. Notify the watch officer when the
   termination is broadcast. If an exercise is terminated prior to arriving at the aircraft, proceed
   to the aircraft with caution and await further instructions from the OTC. Aircrews may
   review NAOC Manual 9-3 for expanded termination procedures.
16.11. Minimum Response Posture (MRP). MRP allows for faster response times during
periods of heightened world tensions. The flight crew and OT remain aboard the aircraft when
operating under MRP. Aircrews will comply with the following guidance:
   16.11.1. Maintain an immediate engine start and launch capability.
   16.11.2. Assume MRP either in the normal parking location or at the end of the runway. If
   parked at the end of the runway, use self-sustained alert procedures to maintain on board
   electrical, pneumatic, and engine start capability.
   16.11.3. The AC and CCOC will coordinate all aircraft servicing and security forces
   protection as required.
   16.11.4. The FA will coordinate meal requirements with the AC and OT NCOIC.
16.12. Deployed Alert.
 62                                                                 AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


   16.12.1. ADVON Team. Prior to deployment, an ADVON team will review the deployed
   location's support plan and procedures as well their ability to sustain alert operations. The
   team will coordinate any changes to the base’s support plan and procedures prior to the alert
   team arriving. HQ ACC/A3CN retains overall responsibility for ADVON as outlined in ACC
   OPORD 84-CY.
   16.12.2. Aircraft Arrival. The ADVON team will brief the alert team on the current support
   plan and procedures. The NAOC Plans and Operations will also review any NIGHTWATCH
   conflict reports with the AC while the alert aircraft is on station.
   16.12.3. Security. Procedures and instructions for alert at deployed locations are contained in
   AFI 31-201.
16.13. Maintenance Requirements.
   16.13.1. Manning of Alert Aircraft. Alert aircraft are ―cocked,‖ ready to fly at a moment’s
   notice and require continuous monitoring of aircraft systems. MX personnel, including the
   aircraft quick-start team, satisfy this need by maintaining a continuous watch on the alert
   aircraft 24/7. During alert launches, the quick-start team will initiate the alert engine start
   checklist. Once in place, the flight crew will continue the checklist at the point and clean up
   any remaining items. Note: During self-sustained operations with one or more engines
   operating, a member of the quick-start team or flight crew will be in one of the pilot seats.
   16.13.2. Maintenance personnel will not:
      16.13.2.1. Adjust the pilot's vertical or reclined seat positions.
      16.13.2.2. Change radio, interphone, volume or other switch settings.
      16.13.2.3. Reconfigure the FE’s panel without prior coordination with the FE.
      16.13.2.4. Rearrange aircrew flight/pro gear.
   16.13.3. Maintenance superintendents will obtain AC and CCOC approval prior to
   performing any non-routine aircraft MX and/or servicing.
   16.13.4. Aircraft Parts and Mission Equipment Components. The authority to order and
   obtain repair parts rests solely with the MX superintendent (aircraft equipment) and/or
   technical controller (mission equipment). Either will make AFTO 781 write-ups, obtain job
   numbers, and make entries into CAMS.
      16.13.4.1. ―Routine‖ status is the default classification assigned for all part order
      requests. Routine orders require delivery within 24 hours.
      16.13.4.2. At times, an ―Immediate‖ (12 hour delivery) or ―Urgent‖ (4 hour delivery)
      status may be necessary. Coordinate either type of request through the CCO (mission
      equipment) or AC (airframe equipment). In cases where special airlift is required, NAOC
      staff operations is the validation authority.
      16.13.4.3. The MX superintendent and/or CCO will brief the AC and CCOC/OTC on
      mission impact, as applicable.
   16.13.5. Ground-Flight Deck Coordination. It is imperative that all communications between
   ground personnel and the flight deck be clear and concise. Ground personnel will
   acknowledge and read back all instructions from the flight deck. To avoid confusion, use
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                       63


   standard terminology. Exercise close coordination and great care when disconnecting ground
   equipment from the aircraft. Unexpected aircraft power interruptions can adversely affect
   mission equipment and thus, mission operations.
16.14. Base Restrictions. Aircrews are normally restricted to those base facilities with operable
klaxons. Crewmembers will use established alert routes and paging devices for notification when
in transit between facilities with klaxons. The OTC may modify alert crew movement areas as
required. Reference AFI 31-201 for local procedures and instructions at deployed locations.
Note: Alert crews are restricted to the area south of the runway at Offutt AFB.
16.15. Transportation.
   16.15.1. Use of NAOC alert vehicles will be at the discretion of the 1 ACCS/DO and OTC.
   Individuals must possess a valid Government Drivers License and AF Form 483, Certificate
   of Competency, stamped for the Offutt AFB flight line before operating any NAOC alert
   vehicle on the flight line. All vehicles supplied for alert team support are considered
   government owned vehicles (GOVs). Drivers will comply with instructions governing the
   use of GOVs.
   16.15.2. Individuals will coordinate an alert response plan with the personnel whom they
   share a vehicle with prior to its use. Notify personnel of departure and return.
   16.15.3. Klaxon Response. Use the alert vehicle rotating beacon. Observe posted speed
   limits in all areas. Only park in designated parking areas. Drive defensively and do not
   assume the right-of-way. Always expect that the base populace is unfamiliar with what you
   are doing when responding to a klaxon. Note: responding alert forces are subject to traffic
   violations.
   16.15.4. Parking. Do not park vehicles in front of the alert aircraft. For klaxon responses at
   Offutt AFB, park vehicles behind the blast fence along the side of the aircraft to avoid jet
   blast damage. When parking behind the guard shack, park in single file behind the white
   lines to allow wing tip clearance on taxi out.
   16.15.5. Vehicle Inspection. The first driver of each day will inspect the vehicle and sign off
   the AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report. Annotate vehicle
   discrepancies and report them immediately to the 1 ACCS Vehicle Control NCO (Offutt
   AFB) or OT vehicle NCO (en route stations) so that repairs can be made in a timely fashion.
   16.15.6. Unless restricted by the OTC, personnel may travel anywhere on base provided it is
   on the alert route. Do not leave the alert route without permission from the OTC.
16.16. Security. Security force protection guidelines are outlined in AFI 31-101 and DoD
Manual S-5210.41-M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual.
   16.16.1. Do not escort personnel onto alert aircraft without prior approval from the AC and
   OTC. All personnel escorted into the PL 1 area shall be signed in on the AF Form 1109,
   Visitor Registration Log. Preannounce all visitors with the OT and security forces.
   16.16.2. Maintain positive control of all briefcases and baggage to help prevent attacks
   against the aircraft and/or billeting quarters.
 64                                                                AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


   16.16.3. Cameras. Use is prohibited on E-4B aircraft without prior permission from the
   NAOC/CC (primary and secondary aircraft) or the 1 ACCS/DO (tertiary and quaternary
   aircraft).
   16.16.4. Security Forces Support. Armed security forces personnel assigned to the mission
   and aboard alert aircraft will retain control of their weapons. The security forces section chief
   will identify those individuals which are armed to the AC and FA.
16.17. Communications During Ground Alert. NAOC utilizes a system of crew notification
klaxons and land mobile radios (LMRs) to maintain continuous communication with and recall
capability of alert crews.
   16.17.1. Klaxon System. Permanently installed klaxon systems are positioned at various
   support bases around the CONUS and other worldwide locations. A current list of klaxon
   locations for each support base can be found in NAOC Manual 9-3.
      16.17.1.1. Activation. Except during the daily test, personnel will consider any activation
      of the klaxon system or alerting device as valid unless specifically notified otherwise. If,
      during the daily test, the klaxon continues to sound for longer than 10 seconds, it should
      be treated as a real-world klaxon.
      16.17.1.2. Testing. The OT watch officer will initiate a daily test of the klaxon system at
      1400 hours (plus or minus 2 minutes) for the primary alert location. Tests should last
      approximately 10 seconds. When arriving at a new alert location after 1400 hours,
      conduct the initial test as soon as possible. Personnel will immediately notify the watch
      officer of locations for which the klaxon fails to test properly.
      16.17.1.3. Outages. The OT watch officer will notify the OTC, OT COMMO, and 1
      ACCS COMM personnel when a klaxon test reveals an inoperable klaxon(s). Alert
      personnel will not visit locations with an inoperable klaxon without OTC approval and a
      second alerting device. In the event of complete klaxon failure or when a significant
      number of klaxons are inoperable, the OTC will provide specific guidance to the alert
      force.
      16.17.1.4. Repairs. 1 ACCS COMM will initiate repairs with the base CE office. Notify
      the OT COMMO and watch officer when klaxons are operational.
      16.17.1.5. Voice-Klaxon Procedures. Utilized during periods of klaxon outages and/or
      malfunctions, awaiting a successful system test, or as directed by the OTC. When
      implemented, personnel will be notified that ―voice klaxon procedures are in effect.‖ Do
      not respond to klaxon activation(s) until notified that ―normal klaxon procedures are in
      effect.‖ Personnel will ensure that they have a minimum two LMRs in their possession if
      they travel away from the primary alert aircraft or crew-rest location.
   16.17.2. LMRs. These devices will be issued to alert personnel for use when transiting
   locations other than the aircraft.
      16.17.2.1. Activation. When the OT watch officer activates the klaxon alert system,
      LMRs emit a steady preamble tone to alert all personnel. Tones should be followed by
      applicable voice commands. In the absence of a voice command, consider the tone a real-
      world alert response and take action appropriately.
AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012                                                                        65


      16.17.2.2. Testing. LMR function will be tested in conjunction with the daily klaxon test.
      Personnel will immediately notify the watch officer of locations for which the LMR fails
      to test properly.
      16.17.2.3. COMSEC. Turn off LMRs when entering the alert aircraft or secure areas
      where classified information might be discussed. LMR batteries will be removed from
      the radio when applicable. Notify the OT watch officer of location and phone number
      prior to turning off the radio.
      16.17.2.4. Security. Safeguard all LMRs to eliminate the possibility of unauthorized
      access and/or having them returned with surveillance and/or explosive devices installed.
      16.17.2.5. Hazard Areas. Do not operate LMRs within 50 feet of open fuel sources or
      refueling operations. LMRs are capable of generating sufficient electrical and/or thermal
      energy to ignite combustible materials. Do not make electronic voice transmissions from
      the aircraft while hot-refueling procedures are in progress.
16.18. Generating Additional Aircraft.
   16.18.1. Aircrews may be tasked to generate additional E-4B aircraft for a variety of
   reasons. The type of notification used depends upon the type of aircrew response required.
   Crewmembers will pay special attention to the exact words used in recall messages and
   accurately relay the message along the notification chain.
   16.18.2. Full EWO Generation and Mobilization. Commanders will initiate all alert recalls
   utilizing the pyramid recall roster. All personnel will report immediately with full alert or
   mobility gear and in the duty uniform unless instructed otherwise.
   16.18.3. Limited Generation and Mobilization. The NAOC/CC and/or 1 ACCS/CC will
   direct the recall of applicable personnel. All personnel will report immediately with full alert
   or mobility gear and in the duty uniform unless instructed otherwise.
      16.18.3.1. Single aircraft generation for alert aircraft tail-swaps normally only require the
      recall of the reserve standby force. Section show times may be staggered based on
      individual preflight requirements.
      16.18.3.2. Generation of an additional aircraft for sustained operations may be performed
      by non-Reserve or Reserve crew members as circumstances dictate.
      16.18.3.3. Aircrews assuming alert following generation activities can expect a seven-
      day alert (minimum) and will comply with the requirements of paragraph 16.4
   16.18.4. When recalling personnel not in conjunction with a 55 WG-initiated base-wide
   recall, the 1 ACCS/CC will contact the following agencies to ensure full coordination:
      16.18.4.1. Command Post.
      16.18.4.2. The 55 OG/CC.
      16.18.4.3. The 1 ACCS Operations Scheduling. Recall flight crew(s) as directed.
      16.18.4.4. The 1 ACCS Communications Branch. Recall mission crew(s) as directed.
      16.18.4.5. The 1 ACCS Operational Support Team. Activate the alert facility, prepare
      flight orders, and generate mission packages.
66                                                              AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


     16.18.4.6. The 1 AMU Maintenance Branch. Notify appropriate MX personnel. Ensure
     AGE personnel are also notified and will initiate their recall. Confirm fuel loads, tail
     number, and aircraft status.
  16.18.5. COMSEC/OPSEC. Use great care in what and how information is passed. Use
  secure means to relay any and all classified information.
  16.18.6. Timing. Safely generate aircraft as expeditiously as possible. For expeditious
  generation, comply with the following guidance:
     16.18.6.1. Maintenance. The 1 AMU will provide a fully mission capable (FMC) aircraft
     fueled to meet the next scheduled sortie’s requirements as soon as possible and/or prior to
     each weekend.
     16.18.6.2. Operations. When airborne aircraft flying training sorties must be generated
     immediately, the aircraft will be recalled by the 1 ACCS/DO. Once recalled, the crew
     will call 1 ACCS/DO by any means available with ETA, maintenance status, and
     estimated landing fuel as soon as possible and continue to monitor Ops frequency.

Terms
ADVON—Advanced Echelon; personnel who arrange support for an upcoming E-4 deployment.
Bird Watch Condition (BWC) Low—Bird activity on and around the airfield representing low
potential for bird strikes.
Bird Watch Condition Moderate—Concentrations of small birds or isolated large bird activity
observable near the runway or in locations that represent a potential hazard to safe flying
operations.
Bird Watch Condition Severe—Heavy concentrations of small birds or significant large bird
activity on or immediately above the active runway, taxiways, in-field areas or the
arrival/departure corridor which represents a significant hazard to safe flying operations.
Category I Route—Any route that does not meet the requirements of a category II route,
including tactical navigation and over water routes.
Category II Route—Any route on which the position of the aircraft can be accurately
determined by the overhead crossing of a radio aid (NDB, VOR, TACAN) at least once each
hour with positive course guidance between such radio aids.
Critical Phase of Flight—Engine start, takeoff, landing, and emergencies.
Deadhead Time—Duty time for crewmembers positioning or de-positioning for a mission or
mission support function and not performing crew duties.
Due Regard—Operational situations that do not lend themselves to International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) flight procedures, such as military contingencies, classified missions,
politically sensitive missions, or training activities. Flight under "Due Regard" obligates the
military aircraft commander to be his or her own air traffic control (ATC) agency and to separate
his or her aircraft from all other air traffic. (See FLIP General Planning, section 7.)
Equal Time Point (ETP)—Point along a route at which an aircraft may either proceed to
destination or first suitable airport or return to departure base or last suitable airport in the same
amount of time based on all engines operating.
Flight Crew—For the purposes of this AFI, the flight crew is defined as all pilots, navigators,
flight engineers, and flight attendants.
Instructor Supervision—Supervision by an instructor of like specialty. For critical phases of
flight, the instructor must occupy one of the seats or stations, with immediate access to the
controls.
Maintenance Status—
A-1;—No maintenance required.
A-2;—Minor maintenance required, but not serious enough to cause delay. Add system phonic
code that identifies the affected units or systems, Alpha, Bravo, etc.
A-3;—Major maintenance required. Delay is anticipated. Affected units or systems are to be
identified as in A-2 status above.
Mission Crew—For the purposes of this AFI, the mission crew is defined as all communication
specialist crewmembers.
 74                                                               AFI11-2E-4V3 7 JUNE 2012


Nightwatch—The unclassified callsign/nickname for the Joint Staff Battlestaff and USAF
support of the NAOC mission.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated and
is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Operational Risk Management (ORM)—A logic-based, common sense approach to making
calculated decisions on human, materiel, and environmental factors before, during, and after Air
Force operations. It enables commanders, functional managers and supervisors to maximize
operational capabilities while minimizing risks by applying a simple, systematic process
appropriate for all personnel and Air Force functions.
Power-on Checks—Aircraft checks accomplished by aircrews which do not involve engine start
and/or aircraft acceptance. Primarily used to verify proper system configurations and switch
positions at aircrew duty stations during ground alert duty.
Primary Aircraft—The first generated E-4B aircraft able to fully perform the NAOC mission
Quaternary Aircraft—A fourth E-4B aircraft capable of being generated to perform the NAOC
mission.
Secondary Aircraft—A second E-4B aircraft capable of being generated to perform the NAOC
mission
Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)—Area weather advisory issued by an
ICAO meteorological office relayed to and broadcast by the applicable ATC. SIGMET
advisories are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, large hail,
severe and extreme turbulence, severe icing, and widespread dust or sand storms. SIGMETs
frequently cover a large geographical area and vertical thickness. They are prepared for general
aviation and may not consider aircraft type or capability.
Tertiary Aircraft—A third E-4B aircraft capable of being generated to perform the NAOC
mission.
