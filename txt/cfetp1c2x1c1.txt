This change is effective immediately. Compliance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training
Program, and other training publications and documents is required.

   1. Write in changes:
         a. Page 12 paragraph 6 changed to read: “Training Decisions. The CFETP
             uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the
             entire spectrum of training requirements for the Combat Control specialty.
             The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the
             training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to
             reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to
             training. The following training decisions were based on a career field
             Utilization & Training Workshop (U&TW) held at Lackland AFB, TX
             from 14-16 March 2006. Key training decisions from the U&TW
             involved making the Orientation Course a Standards Course (Combat
             Control Preparatory Course), adding entry/exit standards for Physical
             Training (PT) throughout the pipeline, adding surface and subsurface
             water standards and adding electric demolition training back into Combat
             Control School (CCS). The training events contained in table 6.2 will not
             be implemented until further notice. The AFCFM is the authority for
             waiving any mandatory training requirement(s). Process waiver requests
             to the AFCFM as described in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5.”
         b. Page 12 paragraph 6.1 to read: “Apprentice Training. The apprentice-
             training pipeline was adjusted to address training deficiencies. Specifically
             para 6.1.1, table 6.1 and table 6.2 below were expanded to include
             progressive rucksack and swim training standards to better prepare
             trainees for follow-on courses in the pipeline with the intent of reducing
             attrition in the latter portions of the training pipeline. In the most
             expeditious manner, the Combat Control Apprentice pipeline provides:
             Preparation for Combat Control physical and mission requirements
             (Combat Control Selection Course); Air Traffic Control Training (Combat
             Control Operator Courses); Basic jump training (Army Airborne), and
             Combat Survival Training. These qualification courses are mandatory
     prerequisites for entry into the AFSC awarding course. The Combat
     Control Apprentice course provides individuals with knowledge and
     hands-on training that prepares them for ASTC with apprentice 3-skill
     level skill sets.
     Note: The training events listed in table 6.2 will not be implemented until
     further notice.”
c.   Page 12 paragraph 6.1.1. to read: “Apprentice Physical Training.
     Superior physical conditioning is a cornerstone of combat effectiveness.
     Combat Control pipeline emphasizes physical training to assure that
     apprentice course graduates have the temperament and potential to meet
     the intense physical challenges inherent in the 5- level upgrade process
     and the CCT specialty. Efficient training of Combat Controllers from the
     Combat Control Selection Course through Apprentice (3-skill level) and
     Journeyman (5-skill level) is a complex, multi-command effort. The
     standards described in tables 6.1 and 6.2 below support STS tasks 1.3.4.
     Perform physical training, 1.3.5 Perform surface and sub-surface
     swimming and 1.3.6 Perform surface and sub-surface water skills training,
     as these tasks apply to the apprentice pipeline. Events may be
     administered in any order necessitated by logistics as long as calisthenics
     exercises are administered in the specified order. PAST test procedures are
     specified per AETC 1C2 Training Pipeline Manager (TPM) and AFI 36-
     2626.
     Note: The underwater training events listed in table 6.2 will not be
     implemented until further notice.”

   Control Selection Course, (b) Combat Control Operator Fundamentals
   and Tower (Air Traffic Control), (c) Basic Parachutist, (d) Combat
   Survival, (e) Combat Control Apprentice. Combat Diver qualification
   training and Military Freefall (Parachutist) qualification training are 3-skill
   level training requirements that are currently not accomplished until the
   individuals graduate from Combat Control School, are awarded their 3-
   skill level and are assigned to the ASTC. All individuals must
   successfully complete the Combat Diver Qualification Course and
   Military Freefall (Parachutist) qualification training to be awarded their 5-
   skill level.”
m. Page 23 paragraph 10.1.1.5.6. to read: “Physical qualification and
   maintenance of personal physical standards as defined in tables 6.1 of this
   CFETP and AFI 13-219, Special Tactics Standards and Evaluation, and
   AFSOCI 36-2204, Special Tactics Training.”
n. Page 23 paragraph 10.1.3. to read: “Implementation. Entry into training
   is through the Oracle Training Administration (OTA). Completion of the
   following courses is required prior for the award of the 3-skill level:
   Combat Control Selection Course (L3AQR1C231-0C0B), Combat Control
   Operator Fundamentals (E3AQR1C231-00FC) / Combat Control Operator
   Tower (E3AQR1C231-00TB), U.S. Army Airborne (L3AQR1T231-002),
   Combat Survival Training (SV-80-A), and Combat Control Apprentice
   (L3ABP1C231-0C1A). The 3-skill level is awarded upon completion of
   the Combat Control Apprentice Course. After graduation from the basic
   courses, qualification and advance specialty training leading to combat
   ready status begins when individuals are assigned to their first duty
   location.”
o. Page 28 paragraph Section A paragraph 1. to read: Implementation.
   This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for 3-skill
   level classes beginning 23 Jun 08 and graduating 17 Sep 08. This date is
   synchronized with the start of the Combat Control Selection Course
   (formerly named the Combat Control Orientation Course), Lackland AFB
   class #006 and Combat Control Apprentice Course, Pope AFB class #004.
   Keesler AFB CCT training will synchronize starting with the 30 Jan 08
   class for enlisted airmen, and the 1 Feb 08 class for Special Tactics Officer
   training. This change takes into account that any extensions to the
   Combat Control Selection Course (formerly named the Combat Control
   Orientation Course) will take place NET FY10 and be incorporated into
   the Air Force Common Battlefield Airmen Training Course.
