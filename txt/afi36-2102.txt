                                             Chapter 1

               PREPARING MEMBERS FOR ASSIGNMENT RELOCATION

1.1. General Overview. This chapter explains how to prepare a member for assignment
relocation. Attachment 33 has instructions for processing non-prior service pipeline students.
     1.1.1. The virtual Out-Processing (vOP) application is mandatory for all permanent party
     personnel on installations where the capability exists. Deviation from this requirement must
     be approved as an exception by HQ AFPC/DPSO.
1.2. Assignment Notification.
     1.2.1. Personnel Relocations Element (PRE). Upon receipt of Assignment Notification
     Report on Individual Personnel (RIP) from HQ Air Force Personnel Center, the PRE has 7
     calendar days to verify the member’s eligibility IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments. If eligible
     for reassignment, the Assignment Notification RIP (along with any other pertinent data) is
     sent to the unit commander with date and time of member’s initial briefing. Follow-up
     actions by the PRE include tracking the Assignment Notification RIP and ensuring it is
     completed and returned to the MPF no later than 14 calendar days from the day RIP was
     received by the unit commander (or designated representative), unless otherwise stated in
     AFI 36-2110 paragraphs 2.32.3 and 2.32.4. For short notice assignments of 90 calendar days
     or less until the RNLTD, the PRE and unit notification periods are reduced to 3 calendar days
     each. The member will still have 7 calendar days from official notification to make an
     assignment election. Ensure the correct active duty service commitment (ADSC) for
     permanent change of station (PCS) and training (if applicable) is included on the RIP IAW
     AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments, table 1.1. If the Personnel Relocations
     Element determines the member is ineligible for reassignment, reclama action is initiated
     immediately.
     1.2.2. Commander. The commander (or designated representative) has 7 calendar days after
     receipt of Assignment Notification RIP to verify no ineligibility factors exist and to officially
     notify the member of the reassignment action. If the commander determines the member is
     ineligible for reassignment; the military personnel flight (MPF) must be contacted to initiate
     reclama actions.
     1.2.3. Other Assignment Notification Instructions. If official assignment notification is by
     message or letter, the commander and the member must acknowledge receipt of the message
     with date notified. The officer ―losing commander’s coordination of officer assignment
     match‖ template is not considered official assignment notification.
     1.2.4. Once Assignment Notification RIP is completed and turned in and assignment
     eligibility criteria is established, if member elected not to accept assignment and associated
     ADSC, PRE must follow 7-Day Option procedures in AFI 36-2110, paragraph 2.37.
1.3.   Initial Processing Actions. Upon official assignment notification, the PRE will:
     1.3.1. Relocation Folder. Prepare a relocation folder for each member selected for
     reassignment. Prepare one relocation folder when reassigning several individuals to the same
     location with the same reporting month (unit move). Dispose of according to the Air Force
AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                 9


  Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. The sequence
  of documents in this folder is optional (each PRE must establish and maintain a standardized
  sequence) and will consist of:
     1.3.1.1. Assignment selection letter, message, or RIP.
     1.3.1.2. AF IMT 907, Relocation Preparation Checklist.
     1.3.1.3. Reassignment orders and all amendments.
     1.3.1.4. Relocation processing memorandum (sample at Attachment 3). Use the
     checklist process contained in the virtual Out-Processing application, within the virtual
     MPF, as source documentation if appropriate.
     1.3.1.5. SGLV 8286, Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Election and
     Certificate.
     1.3.1.6. PCS departure certification statement (endorsed copy of PCS orders).
     1.3.1.7. All PCS/TDY orders will reference a link in the Remarks section that directs
     Airmen to the AFPC homepage, which will contain information regarding any country-
     specific laws, beliefs, etc. related to homosexuality.
     1.3.1.8. All other documents pertaining to the member’s relocation.
  1.3.2. Initial Relocation Briefing. Conduct an initial relocation briefing within 15 calendar
  days after Assignment Notification RIP is forwarded to unit commander. During the
  relocation briefing, the PRE will brief and provide the appropriate relocation documents as
  they relate to the member’s assignment. Mass briefings are suitable. This briefing may be
  conducted online via virtual MPF, but members may require additional processing
  instructions or documents than what is available under virtual MPF for orders completion.
  PREs are responsible for ensuring all members have all required instructions. Completion
  notification of the online briefing will be maintained in the member’s relocation folder.
     1.3.2.1. Assignment Selection Letter, Message, or RIP. Member completes all requested
     information and verifies the data listed on the Assignment Notification RIP; PRE will
     ensure Personnel Data System (PDS) is corrected if data is found to be in error.
     1.3.2.2. AF IMT 907. Annotate all required actions and date of completion. Retain the
     AF IMT 907 in the relocation folder.
         1.3.2.2.1. Special Requirements. NOTE: On the AF IMT 907, when the
         Assignment Notification RIP indicates there are special requirements not otherwise
         covered by this instruction, for example Personnel Processing Codes (PPC), include a
         copy of the specific PPCs in the relocation folder. PPC listings can be obtained
         through the World Wide Web (http://www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/mpf).
     1.3.2.3. Retainability Requirements. Ensure members obtain appropriate retainability
     IAW AFI 36-2110.
     1.3.2.4. ADSC Counseling. Brief member on appropriate ADSC for PCS IAW AFI 36-
     2107. If member will be going TDY en route for training or is PCSing for the purpose of
     receiving training (to include training after in-processing), ensure the most current AF
     IMT 63, Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) Acknowledgment Statement, is
10                                                       AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006


     accomplished. File a copy of the AF IMT 63 in member’s relocation folder and a copy in
     the Unit Personnel Record Group (UPRG).
     1.3.2.5. Assignment Relocation Processing Memorandum (Attachment 3). Provide
     copy to all members and advise them to report to their commander’s support staff (CSS)
     to accomplish required actions as indicated on the memorandum. File this memorandum
     in the relocation folder upon completion of final out-processing. If all items on the
     Assignment Relocation Processing Memorandum are incorporated into the virtual Out-
     Processing (vOP) checklist, then no hard copy of this memorandum is required.
     1.3.2.6. Security Requirements.         Prepare and forward a Security Requirement
     Memorandum to the member's commander when the assignment requires a higher or
     more current security clearance than one possessed; eligibility for special access; or
     eligibility for assignment to a special program. The member's unit will establish a 30-day
     suspense for return of this memorandum from the Security Forces (SF) to PRE. Use the
     Security Requirement Memorandum provided at Attachment 34 or similar product.
     1.3.2.7. Overseas Tour Election. Provide members with the opportunity to elect tour
     options on AF IMT 965, Overseas Tour Election Statement. If concurrent travel
     (CCTVL) is not automatic, the member makes a tour election upon approval or
     disapproval of the CCTVL. Extended tour volunteers must serve the normal tour length
     plus 12 months. NOTE: This form is not required for single members with no
     dependents, military married to military, or any member being assigned to a dependent-
     restricted tour.
     1.3.2.8. Immunization Memorandum. Provide members PCSing to and from the
     overseas area an Immunization Memorandum. Instruct the member to report to the
     immunization clinic for the required immunizations (for member and dependents) before
     departure. File this memorandum in the relocation folder when endorsed by the base
     immunization clinic. A sample Immunization Memorandum is provided at Attachment
     35. NOTE: The Immunization Memorandum is not required for file in the relocation
     folder if the task is signed off on the virtual Out-Processing (vOP) checklist.
     1.3.2.9. Medical and Dental Clearance Memorandum. Medical and dental clearances are
     required for each individual projected to PCS to all overseas locations. Ensure both the
     Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) and Dental Clinic clear member prior to
     departure. Provide each member with the MTF or Dental Clinic Memorandum
     (Attachment 4) or one or more locally devised memorandums. The member will hand-
     carry the appropriate memorandum or memorandums to the MTF and the Dental Clinic
     within 7 workdays of the initial relocation briefing. The MTF and Dental Clinic will
     have the member return the memorandum or memorandums (attached with any AF IMT
     422s, Physical Profile Serial Report) to the PRE after granting or denying final
     clearance. Upon receipt, file the originals in the UPRG, section 4, and place a copy in the
     relocation folder. When the Dental Clinic receives the memorandum, they will schedule
     the member for dental care as necessary and process for dental clearance. NOTE: This
     action does not apply to dependents. If the member is not cleared to proceed on
     assignment, ensure the MTF or Dental Clinic provides justification. Initiate reclama or
     delay action accordingly. Do not release PCS orders until the member receives
     clearance from both the MTF and the Dental Clinic clearing them for PCS.
AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                             11


     1.3.2.10. Dependent Medical Clearance. Ensure medical clearance for dependents is
     completed in the cases of CONUS to overseas assignments, consecutive overseas tours
     (COT), designated location moves (DLM), and for the Exceptional Family Member
     Program (EFMP).
        1.3.2.10.1. Provide members with the AF IMT 1466, Request for Family Member's
        Medical and Education Clearance for Travel. Advise member to hand carry the
        AF IMT 1466 to the MTF. The MTF must complete the AF IMT 1466 before
        recommending family member travel, IAW AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel.
        When completed and returned to the PRE, file the original in the member's UPRG
        and a copy in member's relocation folder.
        1.3.2.10.2. CONUS to CONUS and Overseas to CONUS Moves. If member has a
        family member enrolled in the EFMP (assignment limitation code "Q") and receives a
        CONUS to CONUS or Overseas to CONUS assignment, provide member with the
        AF IMT 1466, where applicable. Advise member that only those family members
        enrolled in the EFMP must be cleared for travel and to hand-carry the AF IMT 1466
        to the MTF. When completed and returned to the PRE, file the original in the
        member’s UPRG and file a copy in member’s relocation folder.
        1.3.2.10.3. EFMP Reassignment. When a member receives an approved EFMP
        reassignment, it will be announced by message from HQ AFPC/DPAPO. In this
        instance only, the AF IMT 1466 is not required since AFPC/DPAPO will have
        confirmed with the gaining location that the needed medical or educational resources
        are available. File a copy of the AFPC/DPAPO approval message in the member's
        UPRG and relocation folder in place of the AF IMT 1466.
        1.3.2.10.4. The approved completed copy of the form is authority for the dependent’s
        relocation (depending upon approved CCTVL or DLM travel [overseas only]). Do
        not release PCS orders prior to receipt of dependent’s medical clearance results.
        If dependent’s travel is denied, inform the member that they may be authorized
        Family Separation Allowance (FSA) and should contact the Financial Services Office
        (FSO) for assistance.
        1.3.2.10.5. Request delay of report no later than date (RNLTD) when a member is
        within 30 days of their RNLTD or 45 days of date eligible for return from overseas
        (DEROS) month and the results of a dependent’s medical or dental clearance are not
        yet available.
     1.3.2.11. Home-basing and Follow-on Assignments. When needed, counsel members on
     home-basing (HB) and follow-on (FO) assignments (reference AFI 36-2110). Members
     applying for a HB or FO must turn in their applications within 15 days of initial PCS
     relocation briefing (or notification of in-place consecutive overseas tour (IPCOT)
     approval).
     1.3.2.12. Weapons Training. Brief members on weapons training requirements.
        1.3.2.12.1. Instruct members selected for relocation overseas to complete weapons
        qualification according to AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Training and Maintenance
        (CATM) Program and PPCs. Also, notify the member’s unit of assignment by
        annotating any special requirements for weapons training reflected in the assignment
12                                                       AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006


        notification on the Relocation Processing Memorandum. If training cannot be
        completed prior to departure, request a waiver from the gaining major command
        (MAJCOM) assignments division.
        1.3.2.12.2. If TDY is required en route for weapons training; confirm a training date
        with the CATM section at the TDY location before advising the member.
        1.3.2.12.3. Do not send the member TDY for the sole purpose of acquiring live fire
        training. If classroom training is available locally, have the CATM annotate the AF
        IMT 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data (or automated product), with the
        classroom training completion date and a statement that member could not live fire.
     1.3.2.13. Office of Special Investigations (OSI) Personal Protection Briefing. Provide
     member with the OSI Personal Protection handout during initial relocation briefing for
     overseas assignments. The OSI will ensure ample copies are provided to the MPF and
     replenish the supply when needed. Refer member to OSI if they have further questions or
     need additional instructions.
     1.3.2.14. Personnel Security Program. Notify the member's duty section to counsel the
     member on any duty or travel restrictions.
     1.3.2.15. Entitlements Fact Sheet. Provide member a copy of relocation entitlements fact
     sheet (Attachment 30).
     1.3.2.16. Passport and/or Visa Requirements. Refer to the Foreign Clearance Guide and
     any associated PPCs to determine passport and visa requirements for the member and
     dependents. Advise member to initiate passport and/or visa requirements no later than 15
     days after initial relocation briefing.
        1.3.2.16.1. Ensure member and/or dependents have the required passports and/or visa
        prior to final out-processing. Member and/or dependents are not allowed to final out-
        process without the required passports/visas in hand for themselves (if applicable)
        and/or dependents.
        1.3.2.16.2. Initiate delay action if this requirement is not complete prior to final out-
        processing date.
     1.3.2.17. PCS Relocation Instructions. Provide members selected for relocation (except
     prisoner transfer and appellate review leave) the Individual's PCS Relocation Instructions
     and Information Memorandum (Attachment 5). This memorandum identifies required
     relocation actions and personal obligations members may have with on- and off-base
     agencies prior to departing PCS. It also includes the Servicing Your Military Pay
     Attachment.
        1.3.2.17.1. Do not use local clearance forms for out-processing.
        1.3.2.17.2. Do not require members to visit or clear through an activity where they
        are not obligated, where they cannot obtain service or assistance, or where their
        physical presence is not required to accomplish clearance. The vOP checklist must be
        used to eliminate unnecessary stops for the member.
     1.3.2.18. Military Pay Counseling. Advise member the FSO will counsel on relocation
     pay.
AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    13


          1.3.2.18.1. Members denied dependent travel may be authorized to request a waiver
          for FSA.
          1.3.2.18.2. Waiver for Payment of FSA. Members who elect to serve an
          unaccompanied tour in-lieu of an accompanied tour are not normally eligible for
          FSA. However, members whose dependents are denied dependent travel at
          government expense can file a waiver with the local FSO. Members must provide a
          written request and pertinent documentation to the local FSO, who will in turn
          forward to the MAJCOM for consideration. (EXAMPLE: PCS orders or an AF IMT
          1466).
       1.3.2.19. Dependency Determination. Refer any questions relating to dependency
       determination to the FSO. Members with dependents in the following categories should
       complete a dependency determination: dependent illegitimate children (includes pre-
       adopted); dependent parents (includes step, adopted, or parents-in-law); incapacitated
       children over age 21 who do not reside in member's household or who are not in
       possession of a valid DD Form 1173, United States Uniform Services Identification
       and Privileges (USIP) Card or enrolled in Defense Eligibility Enrollment System
       (DEERS).
NOTE: Do not include these dependents on the PCS orders until the dependency determination
is complete.
       1.3.2.20. Transportation Counseling. Refer relocating members to Traffic Management
       Office (TMO) after receipt of PCS orders to receive counseling on PCS travel, dependent
       travel, shipment of household goods (HHG), accompanied or unaccompanied baggage,
       non-temporary storage, shipment of a mobile home (if applicable), and shipment and/or
       storage of privately owned vehicle (POV). Advise them TMO will complete the required
       shipping documents and provide flight reservations.
          1.3.2.20.1. Basic Military Training (BMT) and Technical Training Centers (TTC)
          may establish local procedures instead of requiring personal visits to TMO.
          1.3.2.20.2. Additional Weight Allowance. Use the Joint Federal Travel Regulations,
          Volume 1 (JFTR), Uniformed Service Members, for processing personnel to overseas
          locations. NOTE: In the remarks section of the PCS orders, list any shortage items
          members indicate they will ship. Where government quarters are unavailable for
          unaccompanied personnel, include the date of the report and this paragraph as
          authority for shipment of additional weight, or full JFTR PCS weight allowance.
       1.3.2.21. Travel Requirements:
          1.3.2.21.1. Request port call for all transoceanic travel (1st and 2nd legs of travel, if
          required) from the TMO using AF IMT 1546, Request for Flight/Surface
          Reservations, or locally generated form. Include full name and SSN in remarks
          portion of section VI for all dependents requesting international travel. Also include
          the following statement: "All personal information collected is subject to the Privacy
          Act of 1974 and will be protected as required under the same act." Do not request a
          port call for earlier than the first day of the reporting month. Members and
          dependents may travel during the entire reporting month; however, they must provide
          a 10-day travel window for their port call. Prior to departure, the PRE must ensure
 14                                                       AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006


          receipt of confirmed port call is obtained from TMO and the personnel data system is
          updated to reflect travel itinerary.
          1.3.2.21.2. Instruct members PCSing overseas, regardless of end assignment, not to
          depart their home station before receipt of an approved port call or reporting date
          except when they are going TDY en route for over 30 days.
          1.3.2.21.3. If the member goes TDY en route for 30 days or more, the TDY unit will
          obtain the port call. The member’s TDY unit also confirms the port call to the
          gaining MPF IAW AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1, Personnel Data Systems. The losing
          MPF (home station) determines which TDY station obtains the port call if the
          member is TDY to multiple locations. If the TDY station is not an Air Force base,
          the losing MPF (home station) obtains the port call.
          1.3.2.21.4. Request travel on military contract flights for all first-term Airmen who
          PCS to Korea. TMO will furnish alternate travel if this option is not available.
          1.3.2.21.5. When the member is reassigned CONUS to CONUS, the
          member/dependent(s) may use a Privately Owned Conveyance (POC) or request
          transportation from the TMO.
          1.3.2.21.6. Cancel confirmed flight reservations when an individual will not use
          them. Brief members once they depart their home station on PCS; any changes to an
          itinerary, cancellations, or rescheduling is the member’s responsibility. However, the
          member must use the government-contracted commercial travel office (CTO) to make
          travel arrangements. Failure to do so will result in unnecessary out-of-pocket
          expenses. Instruct member to contact the CTO/TMO to turn in any fully unused or
          partially used paper tickets and report any fully un-used/partially used segments of
          electronic tickets. This includes meal tickets or portions of Government Travel
          Requests (GTR) when used.
      1.3.2.22. Instruct member to begin these actions no later than 2 months before actual
      departure date, unless otherwise directed to accomplish earlier. Unit commanders will
      appoint someone else to accomplish out-processing actions for members unable to
      accomplish their own.
1.4. Intermediate Processing Actions:
   1.4.1. Departure Notification. Notify the FSO, Army, Air Force Exchange System
   (AAFES), Commissary, TMO/TMF, MTF, OSI, Services and all interested base agencies of
   projected PCS departures using a computer-generated listing of departees, or virtual MPF, no
   later than 30 calendar days before scheduled departure date or as-soon-as-known (for short-
   notice). Since the Privacy Act requires protection of the SSN, make sure the SSN is only
   disclosed to those offices within DOD who have an official need to know. (NOTE: DO
   NOT send listings including SSN to any agency outside of the DOD IAW the Privacy Act of
   1974). Listing must include: SSN, specific instructions for routing of field record group
   (FRGp), projected base of assignment, reporting month, projected departure date, names of
   members relocating to short-tour areas (for the base medical facility), and names of members
   relocated on short-notice, even if already departed.
AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                  15


      1.4.1.1. Instruct agencies that their portions of the FRGp must arrive at the MPF not later
      than 7 calendar days prior to projected departure date. (MPF may establish local

   medical clearance approval for OCONUS assignments). Additionally, do not release orders
   until receipt of approval/disapproval of follow-on or home-basing application from the
   assignment authority, if eligible. If ADSC incurring training is involved (for officers only),
   ensure ADSC length is included in remarks section and the MPF
   commander’s/superintendent’s signature is on PCS orders.
   1.4.4. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In addition to PCS orders, prepare
   NATO travel orders for members traveling to a NATO country or as directed in the Foreign
   Clearance Guide. Refer to Attachment 7. Do not publish NATO travel orders for members
   departing a NATO country directly to the CONUS.
1.5. Assignment of Patients to Hospitals. The Personnel Relocations Element (PRE) must:
   1.5.1. Establish a relocation folder IAW paragraph 1.3.1.
   1.5.2. Advise the losing commander to appoint an individual to accomplish out-processing
   actions on behalf of the member if the member is unable to accomplish their own.
   1.5.3. Coordinate with MPF Evaluations and Promotions to ensure required actions are
   complete.
   1.5.4. Procure and forward the field record group (FRGp) IAW AFI 36-2608. NOTE: It is
   important for DPMAR to maintain close coordination with both the losing and gaining
   hospital patient affairs section and the gaining MPF to ensure all actions are complete.
   1.5.5. Publish PCS orders, (see Attachment 12) AF IMT 899 (Request and Authorization

   reassigned to an on-base medical facility (intra-MPF PCA). Procedures outlined in AFCSM
   36-699, Chapter 5, will be used.
1.6. Assignment of Patients from the Hospitals. The Personnel Relocations Element must:
   1.6.1. Maintain close contact with the local hospital patient’s affairs office.

1.7. Final Out-Processing Actions.
   1.7.1. Final Out-Processing Date. Brief members they are not authorized to out-process
   earlier than 1 duty day (2 duty days in the overseas area) prior to their actual departure date
   or date official leave and travel begins. EXAMPLE: Do not charge leave for the weekend
   for individuals who out-process on Friday and certify they will not depart the local area until
   the following Monday. However, if members depart prior to Monday, their leave or travel
   will start the actual time and date they physically depart. IAW AFI 36-2903, Table 1.3,
   Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, instruct members to wear their
   military uniform for all out-processing appointments to include their final out-processing
   appointment.
   1.7.2. Final Out-Processing Interview. Review the AF IMT 907, Relocation Preparation

   Customer Service for reissue. Member must ensure dependent’s ID cards are current.
   1.7.4. FRGp Documents. Account for all appropriate FRGp documents on the AF IMT 330,
   Records Transmittal/Request, before dispatching the FRGp.              NOTE: Annotate
   performance reports IAW AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System. Annotate
   documents you cannot include with the estimated date you will forward them. Set suspense
   to forward the missing documents by the established date or advise the gaining MPF of
   status. When an officer performance report (OPR), enlisted performance report (EPR),
   training report, or letter of evaluation (LOE) is due but not forwarded with the UPRG,
   provide the losing MPF Career Enhancement Element a copy of the AF IMT 330.

        1.7.4.4. Complete the PCS Departure Certification, AF IMT 899, Request and
        Authorization for Permanent Change of Station-Military, block 18, in 2 copies. File
        the original in the member's UPRG and annotate the AF IMT 330. Place the copy in the
        relocation folder for subsequent PDS update.
     1.7.5. If member is being reassigned to a geographically separated unit (GSU), mail
     member’s UPRG to gaining MPF not later than 15 days prior to departure date IAW AFI 36-
     2608 unless PPC dictates member hand-carry UPRG. For example: USAFE Munitions
     Support Squadrons (MUNSS) sites and Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) positions

relocation.
   2.12.1. Health Care Coverage. Members interested in post-separation medical coverage
   must be referred to the MTF for information brochures and application for the Continued
   Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP). Information can also be obtained by calling the
   civilian contractor, CHCBP Administrator, at 1-800-809-6119.

   discharge on the discharge review procedures and provide application forms IAW AFI 36-
   3202, Separation Documents, (Attachment 5).
   2.12.4. Advise officers to contact an ethics attorney at their wing or base legal office to
   discuss whether there may be restrictions on their post-government employment with respect
   to companies doing business with the government. This is especially important for program
   managers, deputy program mangers, contracting officers, and persons who have been
   involved in source selections. Additional guidance can be found in the DOD Directive
   5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation.
2.13. TAP Pre-separation Counseling.
   2.13.1. Refer all members to the FSC no later than 120 days prior to separation or retirement
   for mandatory TAP pre-separation counseling. FSC pre-separation counseling covers
   Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) disability benefits compensation information.
       2.13.1.1. The FSC will provide counseling via the DD Form 2648, Pre-separation
       Counseling Checklist, which documents that pre-separation counseling. File the original
       DD Form 2648 in member’s UPRG (Section 4) and a copy in the relocation folder (this
       applies to court-martial cases also). Do not out-process without DD Form 2648.
       2.13.1.2. When members cannot be physically present for separation (ordered home on
       PCS to await further instructions, transferred to a VA hospital, etc.), notify the FSC by
       telephone to set up a briefing prior to the member’s departure. If a member is
       transferring to a VA hospital and his/her physical or mental condition prevents the
       briefing, enclose a memorandum stating so and forward it to their local VA. Enclose a
       copy of this memorandum in member’s UPRG (Section 4) and relocation folder.

       the DVA Toll Free Hotline at 1-800-827-1000.
          2.13.2.1.1. DVA representatives should assist the members in completing the VA
          Form 21-526 and attach supporting documents such as medical summaries, medical
          board reports or the disability retirement letter or order.
          2.13.2.1.2. DVA compensation or pension in most cases is not retroactive and will be
          assessed from the date awarded; therefore, stress to each member the importance of
          completing the VA Form 21-526 prior to separating or retiring.
          2.13.2.1.3. Forward the completed application to the DVA Regional Office with

Retired Personnel, and SBP RIP, provided by the SBP Counselor, must be filed in the
member’s UPRG.
2.15. Transportation Counseling. Counsel members to report to TMO before receipt of orders
to ascertain the best means of travel. They should report to TMO after receipt of orders to
arrange for shipment and storage of HHG, baggage, and POV.

2.18. Recognizing Members Being Retired. When members have an approved retirement,
their unit is responsible for procuring all appropriate items required for a retirement ceremony
(e.g., retirement certificates, lapel pins, U.S. flags, etc.). The National Defense Authorization
Act of 1999 mandates a U.S. flag will be presented at no cost to the member upon retirement.

     mobile home, inform the MPF PRE so they can authorize it on your PCS orders.
     ( ) p. Secretarial Waiver for Second Dislocation Allowance (ALL PERSONNEL). If you
     departed your last duty station within this fiscal year and are departing your present duty
     station before the start of the next fiscal year, the MPF must request a secretarial waiver
     for a second payment of dislocation allowance within the same fiscal year. If you do not
     receive a secretarial waiver before your departure, you may not be paid a dislocation
     allowance for you and your family. If you are in doubt, check with your PRE. The
     exception to this policy is for Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) or
     humanitarian reassignment.
     ( ) q. Military Family Housing. If you are occupying military family housing, visit the
     Base Housing Office for clearance prior to departure. Failure to complete clearance of
     base housing could result in administrative action. Also, all eligible military personnel
     may submit an advance application for military family housing after publication of
     permanent change of station orders. Contact the Base Housing Office to submit an
     advance application for housing. Remember to report to the Housing Referral Office
     (HRO) at your new duty station before entering into a commitment for off-base housing.
     ( ) r. Authorization for payment of more than two POCs (privately owned conveyances –
     JFTR, paragraph U5015-B). Authorization must be according to the JFTR. If you think
     you will qualify for this, contact the MPF PRE for qualification procedures. When
     authorization for two or more POCs exist, monetary allowance in lieu of transportation
     (MALT) is paid according to JFTR, paragraph U5105-B1, for the number of authorized
     travelers in each POC. A spouse is considered as accompanying the member for per diem
     purposes when the spouse travels concurrently in a separate authorized POC.
     ( ) s. Moving of Dependents on PCS.
        (1) Command-Sponsored. For those who qualify for travel of dependents at
        government expense to accompanied-by-dependent areas and desire their dependents
        to accompany them, exercise extreme care when completing AF IMT 1466, Request
AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    69


      for Family Member"s Medical and Education Clearance for Travel. In many
      overseas areas, adequate medical care is not available for all conditions which
      dependents may have. Special education classes for some types of handicaps often are
      not available.
          (a) To ensure absence of needed medical care or education services does not cause
          a hardship for your family, identify these conditions (any conditions requiring
          regular, frequent or special medical care or special education or training) on the
          AF IMT 1466. Through this, a determination can be made regarding the proper
          care at the gaining location. Also, if dependency has not been established or
          verified in the previous 12-month period, report to the local FSO for counseling.
      (2) Non-command-Sponsored. Relocating non-command-sponsored dependents is
      highly discouraged.     Non-command-sponsored dependents are not normally
      authorized access to medical, educational, housing and commissary facilities, even if
      available. An AF IMT 1466 for command sponsorship may be submitted at a later
      date.
   ( ) t. Family Care Responsibilities. Air Force members must make adequate family care
   arrangements to permit them to fulfill a full range of military obligations. If you plan to
   take dependents overseas to a location covered by a noncombatant evacuation operation
   (NEO) plan, you must also make adequate advance arrangements for the evacuation and
   care of your dependents. Your unit commander can answer questions concerning
   dependent care responsibilities.
      (1) In planning for the PCS, you should ensure you have sufficient funds to defray the
      costs of supporting dependents at the new location. The INTRO program provides
      information needed to plan for the care of dependents at the new location. Your
      sponsor at your new duty station can provide you with detailed information on average
      expense in getting settled and availability of dependent care facilities.
   ( ) u. Passport Requirements. If you are relocating to an area requiring passports or
   visas, you must have birth certificates with the official seal of the state agency for you and
   your dependents. The Department of State rejects passport applications submitted without
   valid birth evidence. Submit passport applications no later than 15 days after initial
   relocation briefing. The average time for routine passport processing is 75 days, and
   delays in application processing could result in not receiving passports in time to travel
   with sponsor or to meet other travel plans.
      (1) Should you not have valid birth evidence in your possession, see a base passport
      agent immediately for the proper address to request it and the associated costs.
      Receipt of birth certificates from state agencies can take as long as 2 months. If you
      do not require a passport prior to departure to the overseas area, we recommend you
      take an official birth certificate with you to the overseas area.
   ( ) v. Special Security Investigative Requirement. If you have been selected for an
   assignment requiring access to Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence (SCI) Information,
   you must complete a new SF 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions. You
   cannot depart PCS until final SCI access determination is made by the gaining MAJCOM.
70                                                         AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006


        (1) Do not take any actions to relocate family or household goods until the PRE
        notifies you of your acceptance for the SCI position. Processing delays could cause
        extension of your Report Not Later Than Date (RNLTD). Denial of SCI access will
        result in assignment cancellation. (Extension of RNLTD does not apply to overseas
        returnees.)
     ( ) w. You must have all required spectacles before you depart. Report to the optometry
     clinic to request and pick up spectacle inserts for the MCU-2/P mask.
     ( ) x. En Route Medical and Dental Care. Procedures for obtaining non-emergency
     medical care outside your TRICARE region vary; contact the TRICARE Service Center
     (TSC) at your departure base for details. If you require medical care en route, follow the
     TSC guidance or go to the nearest Uniformed Services Medical Treatment Facility
     (MTF). For emergency dental care en route, go to the nearest Uniformed Services MTF
     or seek civilian care. If you receive emergency treatment at a civilian facility, have the
     treatment bill mailed to the nearest Air Force MTF. If you are hospitalized in a civilian
     facility, notify the nearest Air Force MTF (Patient Affairs Office) as soon as possible.
     ( ) y. Additional Weight Allowance. If you are relocating overseas to a weight-restricted
     location, you may be authorized to ship additional weight for household goods. Be sure
     the relocation clerk discusses this subject with you during counseling.
     ( ) aa. TRICARE Family Member Dental Plan (FMDP) and Space Available Dental
     Care:
        (1) Overseas PCS. Family dental care in military dental treatment facilities (DTFs)
        overseas is limited to maintaining oral health by providing preventive, basic
        restorative, and essential specialty care. Family members enrolled in the FMDP, who
        require dental treatment that DTFs are unable to provide, may be referred to host-
        nation providers. However, family members should be advised that not all services
        are available or accessible at all OCONUS locations. Sponsors and family members
        are encouraged to check with the losing base Family Support Center, Relocation
        Assistance, for base-specific dental information available through their websites.
            (a) Disenrollment from the FMDP is strictly voluntary; it will not happen
            automatically upon your PCS. The member must report to the MPF Customer
            Service to disenroll from the FMDP IAW AFI 36-3025, TRICARE - Active Duty
            Family Member Dental Plan (FMDP).
            (b) CONUS PCS. Space available dental care for dependents is extremely limited
            at CONUS locations. When you arrive at your new location, contact the Health
            Benefits Advisor (HBA) and determine if you want to voluntarily enroll in FMDP.
            You must have 12-24 months remaining on your military commitment to qualify
            for FMDP OCONUS returnee enrollment. If you are already participating in
            FMDP, your enrollment continues when you go PCS. All FMDP termination
            actions require voluntarily election unless not meeting DEERS eligibility and
            enrollment requirements IAW AFI 36-3025, and AFI 36-3026(I), Identification

         may use their POC for CONUS or intra-theater travel. It is mandatory DOD
         policy to use CTOs for all transportation requirements.
         ( ) ac. Family Support Center (FSC). The FSC offers a variety of programs and
         services to meet the needs of relocating families and single service members.
         Under the Relocation Assistance Program, relocating personnel have the
         opportunity to make informed decisions about their next or final duty station. The
         programs and services include: professionally conducted relocation workshops to
         help personnel and family members prepare for a move; the Standard Installation
         Topic Exchange Service (SITES), a continually updated CD ROM program that
         has worldwide, in-depth installation information and is also accessible through the
         Internet for on-line users; worldwide installation brochures and video cassettes for
         checkout; and a loan closet for much needed household items. Additionally, the
         Relocation Assistance Program offers a network of base experts to keep personnel
         informed of ever-changing relocation information.
            (1) If you are selected for a remote tour assignment and you have family
            members, you are required to see the Relocation Manager at your local FSC for
            information on specific assistance/services available to your family members
            while you serve on your remote tour assignment.
            (2) If your family is staying in the local area, your FSC personnel will inform
            you of the services available for your family during your absence, obtain
            permission from you to contact your family during your remote tour, provide
            member contact card(s) with their 1-800 number and follow-up with your
            family to determine what assistance they may need.
            (3) If your family member is relocating near an installation, your local FSC
            personnel will inform you and/or your family member(s) of the services
            available at the new installation during your absence and obtain permission
            (from you) to forward the contact information to that installation, contact the
            new installation to inform them of your family’s pending arrival and forward a
            copy of the contact information to that base and provide member contact
            card(s) with their 1-800 number.
            (4) If your family member is not located near another military installation,
            your local FSC personnel will inform you of the services available at the FSC
            for your family and provide member contact cards with their 1-800 number.
         ( ) ad. Emergency. Contact the nearest Air Force Command Post during non-duty
         hours if problems occur while en route to a PCS location. The Command Post is
         manned 24 hours and can provide emergency assistance.

         for training, you may incur an active duty service commitment associated with this
         training. Ensure AF IMT 63, Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC)
         Acknowledgment Statement, is accomplished prior to your departure.

Servicing Military Pay For Your Assignment                         (typed name, grade, USAF)
SERVICING MILITARY PAY FOR YOUR ASSIGNMENT
Part I. Your Financial Plan
1.1. The Financial Services Office (FSO) is a service organization. During your transfer, your
pay will require service that goes beyond the normal day-to-day interest you and the FSO have
in your pay. In order for the FSO to service your pay in the most efficient manner, we ask you
take the following actions:
      1.1.1. Review your latest Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) and make sure each item
      pertaining to your pay is correct.
      1.1.2. Determine your financial obligations during your transfer and those continuing
      after your move.
      1.1.3. Compare your latest LES and your financial obligations and develop a plan
      compatible with your financial status. In developing this plan, consider the following
      areas:
         1.1.3.1. Allotments. Do I need to start, stop, or change any allotment?
         1.1.3.2. Address. Do I need to change the mailing address for any of my allotments,
         bonds, or pay checks?
         1.1.3.3. Checking Account. Will I require any change in the financial organization
         currently receiving my paycheck, or do I need to establish a bank account so I may
         take advantage of uninterrupted pay during my transfer?
AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     75


NOTE: If you are going PCS overseas, you may experience a 6- to 8-week delay when
requesting blank checks due to delays in bulk rate mail going overseas. If you are participating
in SURE-PAY (Air Force payroll direct deposit program) and your net pay is going to a bank,
you should ensure you have an adequate supply of blank checks before departing the CONUS.
To avoid disruption of pay while PCS en route, members are encouraged to maintain their
current financial institution until they arrive at their new duty station. However, if you decide to
close your account, contact your local FSO to stop your sure pay, this is not automatic.
        1.1.3.4. Allowances. (Advance pay or travel pay.) Do I need assistance in
        determining what my allowances for military pay and travel pay are before, during,
        and after my transfer? Review your PCS orders for accuracy. The PCS order is used
        to calculate your travel allowances.
        1.1.3.5. Pay Service. Do I expect prompt and accurate pay service during my transfer
        and relocation?
        1.1.3.6. LES. Do I want to receive my LES while en route, have it retained at DFAS-
        DE, forwarded to the gaining FSO, or mailed to my sponsor?
        1.1.3.7. Family Separation Allowance (FSA). Do I need assistance in determining
        my authorization for FSA on my next assignment? EXAMPLE: Dependents denied
        travel to new duty station.
        1.1.3.8. Deductions. Do I need to start, stop, or change dental premium deductions
        for the FMDP program?
     1.1.4. If you plan to transport your dependent children over the age of 21 (full time
     student, age 21–23, incapacitated children, and/or wards of the court) or dependent
     parents at government expense, do you have a current dependency determination on file at
     the FSO? If you do not have a current dependency determination on file, report to the
     FSO not later than 5 workdays after your relocation processing interview. NOTE: A
     favorable dependency determination for issue of identification cards, medical benefits, or
     Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) does not satisfy the requirement for dependency for
     travel.
     1.1.5. If your answer to any of the questions in paragraphs 1.1.3 or 1.1.4 is "yes," then
     you need to contact the Military Pay Section at the FSO. See Part II below for obtaining
     this service.
     1.1.6. Social Security Number (SSN). If your dependents are relocating overseas and
     there is a possibility they may need a SSN while overseas, we recommend you obtain the
     SSN before their departure from the CONUS.
Part II. The FSO and Your Pay. This is a time-phased schedule to aid you in your financial
planning and to provide the pay services you desire.
2.1. Your projected departure date is ____________________. This is the date you expect to
sign out from your present organization. If your projected departure date changes, notify your
FSO representatives immediately.
 76                                                         AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006


2.2. Thirty days before your projected departure or DEROS date, contact the Military Pay
Section at the Financial Services Office to make any change to your pay and to initiate transfer
actions. FSO will enter the following information:
DATE CONTACTED FSO _________________ FSO TELEPHONE EXTENSION
________________
FSO REPRESENTATIVE NAME ___________________
2.3. Seven days before your projected departure or DEROS date, contact the FSO to ensure
the desired changes are made (may be accomplished by phone).
2.4. The above contacts with your FSO representative are the minimum essential contacts to
ensure success of your financial plan and allow for a smooth transfer of your pay. During any
other time, feel free to contact your FSO representative for assistance in financial planning for
you and your dependents.
2.5. If you are going PCS overseas on an unaccompanied tour, you must provide the FSO at
your gaining base the complete address of where your dependents are residing in the CONUS;

AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                  83


NOTE: Failure to contact the CTO/TMO when making official travel arrangements in

H1). COT leave travel is intended to be taken en route to the new PDS. For all eligible members
and command-sponsored dependents (if applicable) authorized COT leave travel, the following
statement must be included in the PCS orders: ―Member (and dependents) are authorized leave
travel in conjunction with COT assignment according to JFTR, paragraph U7200.‖ This
statement should also be included in the orders for members authorized to self-defer their COT
leave travel. (This will prevent future confusion on whether the member/dependents have an
entitlement.) NOTE: Members and command-sponsored dependents authorized COT/IPCOT
transportation in Alaska are limited to reimbursement for government air travel. Member can
request a waiver to allow travel by POC versus government air travel by submitting written
justification for approval to HQ PACAF/DP.
(Deferment of COT Travel). The COT leave travel is used between the losing and gaining
PDS. However, if, due to mission requirements, the member cannot use the COT leave travel en
route, the losing commander can authorize a deferment. The deferment approval must be based
on mission reasons, not the personal preference of the member. This does not preclude the
losing commander from authorizing leave (non-COT) en route during the PCS. The following
statement must be included in the orders: ―Member authorized to defer COT travel.‖ If en-route
leave (non-COT) is granted, an additional statement must be included to read, ―Member is
authorized (specify number, cannot exceed 10) days of leave en route in conjunction with the
COT deferment. If a member exceeds the authorized en-route leave days, the losing commander
must approve the additional days (amendment to the PCS order is required) and the COT leave
travel will be considered used.‖
Members that must traverse the CONUS on their way to the new PDS are expected to use their
COT leave travel en route. If the member is unable to use the COT leave travel en route due to
mission reasons; the losing commander may grant a deferment of the COT leave travel.

Members are considered traversing the CONUS if they pass across, over, or through the
CONUS. Members traversing the CONUS are required to obtain approval for COT leave travel
deferment from their losing commander. EXAMPLE: Members going PCS from Ramstein AB,
GE, to Osan AB, Korea; members going PCS from Elmendorf AFB, AK, to Ramstein AB, GE;
or members going PCS from Southwest Asia to Misawa AB, JA, would have to obtain their
losing commander’s approval in order to defer COT leave travel.
Members authorized COT leave travel entitlement that do not have to traverse the CONUS to
their new PDS, do not have to obtain the losing commander’s permission for COT leave travel
deferment. EXAMPLE: Members going PCS from Ramstein AB, Germany, to Lakenheath AB,
UK, and members going PCS from Eielson AFB, AK, to Elmendorf AFB, AK, would not have
to obtain their losing commander’s approval for deferment.
Members must remember that the COT leave travel must be completed prior to the end of the
new tour; otherwise the COT leave travel expires. See JFTR for exception for contingency
operations.

  PCS order.
Do not publish an amendment to:

  at the gaining location.
  d) Correct inaccurate first and middle names or initials.

  order.
  d) Once members arrive on base according to reassignment orders, even if not signed in, do
  not publish amendments to divert or continue them. Their arrival on base makes it a
  completed move, and new PCS orders must be published. A Secretary of the Air Force (SAF)
  waiver must also be obtained to authorize a second DLA within the same fiscal year.
Amendments by a Gaining Organization. Gaining organizations may publish amendments to
PCS orders for a member being assigned to them when he or she became eligible for dependent
travel by marriage, if they have proof the member gained eligibility before the member officially

SAMPLE INDIVIDUAL"S SEPARATION AND RETIREMENT INSTRUCTIONS AND
                  INFORMATION MEMORANDUM

MEMORANDUM FOR MEMBER - GRADE, NAME, SSN                                  (date)
FROM: (Functional Address Symbol)
SUBJECT: Individual's Separation and Retirement Instructions and Information
1. Separation Relocation Preparation Actions. The Personnel Relocations Element (PRE)
should have briefed you concerning this relocation during the initial preparation interview. To
assist you in completing certain requirements associated with your relocation, please read the
information in the checked paragraphs below as they apply to your move. If you have any
questions concerning your preparation, do not hesitate to ask. Our purpose is to thoroughly
advise and prepare you for this relocation.
    a. ID Requirements. If you are being discharged, you will surrender your ID card/CAC on
    the day of separation. If you are being released from active duty and will transfer to an
    inactive or active Reserve component or if you are retiring, the Customer Service Element
    will prepare a new ID card for you and your dependents. You may get your new ID cards
    prior to departure or keep your current ID cards until your date of separation.
        (1) Remember, if you choose to keep your active duty ID card and it reflects a date
        beyond established DOS, we will issue you an active duty ID card reflecting the correct
        DOS. Once your active duty ID card expires, report to the nearest MPF Customer
        Service Element for your new ID.
    b. Military Pay. Your pay is the most important item in the separation processing and we
    want to do all we can to ensure it is accurate; visit the Financial Services Office (FSO) to
    establish a timeline for out-processing with them. The FSO provides counseling on a
    variety of subjects regarding your pay on separation. Attachment 1 of this letter explains
    some of the more important items concerning your final pay; carefully review it before
    reporting to the FSO.
    c. Travel. Your travel and transportation allowances are determined from the Joint Federal
    Travel Regulations (JFTR). In addition, travel advances may be authorized on your
    separation from the service, release from active duty, or retirement; however, you must
    furnish a written statement you actually intend to travel, and you must name the point to
    which you are traveling to support a travel advance.
        (1) Separating members who complete less than 90 percent of the initial agreed period
        of service or members discharged under other than honorable conditions may receive an
        advance; however, the amount is limited to 75 percent of the least costly mode of
        common carrier transportation available (usually bus). Per diem advances are not
        authorized.
        (2) Retirees may receive advance allowances. All members are authorized an advance
        of travel allowance based on the transportation mode. According to Public Law 97-60,
        effective 1 November 1981, members must actually travel to receive full separation
AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    109


        travel allowances; therefore, you must submit a travel settlement voucher upon
        completion of travel to receive the remainder of the travel allowance.
    d. Medical Care Eligibility. Separation or retirement affects you and your dependents"
    statutory authority for military-sponsored health care. Loss of this authority results in your
    being financially liable for all civilian and military health care (medical and dental) received

        Consult with your Patient Affairs Office for further details.
    e. Department of Veterans Affairs Disability Compensation Application. You are eligible
    to submit an application to the VA for disability compensation if separating or retiring.
    Although you do not have to apply before separation or retirement, you are encouraged to
    file the VA claim before you leave the service since your medical records can be obtained
    more easily and in most situations VA compensation is not retroactive. Filing this
    application will not delay your separation in any way.
        (1) Service-Disabled Veterans" Insurance (SDVI) is life insurance available to veterans
        who are granted a service-connected disability. Consult the VA for further assistance.

    important information you will need to apply for benefits based on your military service
    under programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of
    Labor.
        (1) You will receive copies 1 and 4 of the DD Form 214. These copies will reflect your
        time in the Air Force, work experience, training, service characterization, reenlistment
        eligibility, time lost, and reason for separation. The information reflected on copy 4 will
        assist you when applying for unemployment compensation, education assistance, or
        other veterans" benefits.
    (2) We advise you to make copies of your DD Form 214 and register them at the county
    courthouse or other registering agency if your state has the facilities to perform this
    function. NOTE: Registering the DD Form 214 with registering agencies could permit
    public access to your DD Form 214 IAW state or public law. You should take the same
    steps to safeguard it as you would any other sensitive document by storing it in a safe
    deposit box or some other secure location. If you have a request or an inquiry pertaining to

Servicing Military Pay for Your Separation or Retirement
SERVICING MILITARY PAY FOR YOUR SEPARATION or RETIREMENT
Part I. Your Financial Plan
1.1. During your separation processing, your pay will require service that goes beyond the
normal day-to-day interest you and the FSO have in your pay. In order for the FSO to service
your pay in the most efficient manner, we ask that you take the following actions:
    1.1.1. Review your latest Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) and ensure each item
    pertaining to your pay is correct.
    1.1.2. Determine any financial obligations you may have before your separation or
    retirement or those you may incur in relocating yourself or your dependents.
    1.1.3. The FSO can assist or advise you in a variety of pay subjects. Areas you need to
    consider are:
        1.1.3.1. Terminal Leave. Terminal leave allows you to complete your separation or
        retirement processing and depart your present organization on leave. It cannot exceed
        the number of days leave you have accrued or will accrue up to your separation date.
        The FSO can provide you with the requirements for this type of leave. If you are
        considering taking terminal leave, you should take into account you will not receive
        your final pay upon your departure. Your final separation pay will be mailed to you on
        your actual separation date. NOTE: Effective February 1976, you may only sell 60
        days leave during your career.
AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   115


        1.1.3.2. Final Pay. If you do not take terminal leave, you will receive your final pay
        before your departure from your duty station or separation base if returning to CONUS
        for separation. This pay will include payment for all known allowances up to your
        separation date. The key words are "known allowances." You must take action to make
        sure that you and your FSO know all your allowances. It is important you provide the
        MPF with a correct future mailing address.
        1.1.3.3. Travel Pay. You will be paid separation or retirement travel pay before you
        depart from your duty station (or separation base if returning to the CONUS for
        separation) if requested. Separating members (other than those who have not completed
        90 percent of their agreed-upon period of service or those discharged under other than
        honorable conditions) will receive payment for up to 75 percent of the elected
        transportation mode to either their home of record or place of enlistment.
            1.1.3.3.1. If you have not completed 90 percent of your agreed-upon period of
            service or if you have been discharged under other than honorable conditions,
            contact your local FSO to determine your travel allowance.
            1.1.3.3.2. On completion of travel, mail DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or
            Subvoucher, or take the form to your separating FSO to finalize your claim and
            receive the balance of the entitlement.
            1.1.3.3.3. Retirees are authorized to receive 100 percent of their travel allowance in
            advance based on their certification as to the location to which travel will be
            performed. The travel advance is based on the selected transportation mode.
            Contact your FSO to determine your allowance.
        1.1.3.4. Allotments and Bonds. Your FSO will advise you of any action required for
        your allotments and advise you on withdrawal of any bonds being held for safekeeping t
        the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS-CL/RO).
        1.1.3.5. Direct Deposit. The Air Force uses direct deposit to distribute pay unless a
        waiver is obtained. Retirees may request a waiver in writing within 60 days prior to
        retirement or anytime after retirement. The request must justify it would be in their best
        financial interest to decline participation in the program. Send waiver requests to
        DFAS-CL/RO, PO Box 99191, Cleveland OH 44199-1126.
        1.1.3.6. Other Allowances. The FSO can assist you in determining any post-service
        allowances, severance pay, readjustment pay, or any other areas of pay on which you
        have a question.
        1.1.3.7. Deductions. Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver CO (DFAS-
        DE) will automatically stop your TRICARE- Active Duty Family Member Dental Plan
        (FMDP) premium deductions prior to your separation or retirement date. There is no
        FMDP coverage after your date of separation or retirement.
Part II. Servicing Your Retired Pay
1.1. In order for the FSO to assist you in the most efficient manner, take the following actions to
ensure an accurate and timely transition from active duty pay to retired pay.
 116                                                         AFI36-2102 18 SEPTEMBER 2006


    1.1.1. Allotments: You may carry forward all allotments and bonds (see note) currently in
    effect on active duty except for Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), Veterans Educational
    Assistance Program (VEAP) and deposits to the Uniformed Services Savings Deposit
    Program. If you currently have an allotment that you do not want to carry forward to your
    retired pay, contact your local FSO to stop it at least 30 days prior to retirement. Retirees are
    authorized a total of 15 allotments, of which no more than 6 can be discretionary allotments.
    Examples of discretionary allotments include, but are not restricted to, the following:
    insurance premiums, voluntary payment of dependent or relative, deposit to financial
    institution, mutual fund, investment firm, car loan, mortgage or rent, and consumer credit
    loans. Discretionary allotments can be stopped, changed or started after retirement. Non-
    discretionary allotments are limited to the following: savings bonds, indebtedness to United
    States, delinquent taxes, and payment of pledges or loans to specific service relief funds.
NOTE: If you purchase a bond through partial monthly deductions, we will refund any
deductions held towards the purchase of a bond. The allotment will restart in the first month of
retirement. EXAMPLE: A member retires 1 July 1997. In April 1997, he started a 5-month
deduction towards the purchase of a $100 savings bond. He will receive a refund for the amount
withheld since 1 April in the final active duty pay received. The retired pay system will
automatically restart the bond effective 1 July 1997. NOTE: Review your first retired pay LES
to ensure proper payment of your allotments. If there are any discrepancies contact the FSO or
DFAS-CL for assistance. </n_para.txt>
    1.1.2. Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW). FITW information will automatically
    carry forward to your retired pay. If you desire to change the number of withholding
    exemptions, see your FSO at least 30 days before retirement. After retirement, go to your
    nearest FSO or mail a TD Form W-4, Employee Withholding Allowance Certificate, to
    DFAS-CL/RO, PO Box 99191, Cleveland OH 44199-1126.
    1.1.3. Address. MPF provides DFAS-CL with the address at which you elect to receive
    your retired pay or adjustments to your active duty pay. If your check currently goes to a
    bank, it will continue to go to the same bank; no action is necessary on your part. If you use
    Direct Deposit for your retired paycheck, you must have a correspondence address on file
    (other than the address of your financial organization) for mailing account statements,
    newsletters, and so on.
        1.1.3.1. If you change banks now, while on terminal leave, or after retirement, submit a
        SF Form 1199A, Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form, to your nearest FSO. The FSO will
        forward it to DFAS-CL/RO, P.O. Box 99191, Cleveland, OH 44199-1126 to ensure
        prompt receipt of your last active duty and retired paychecks. You must also provide
        your new correspondence address to the MPF, who in turn notifies DFAS.
2.1. The Directorate of Retired Pay Operations at DFAS will send you your first Air Force retiree
or annuitant account statement at the end of the first month of retirement. Thereafter, you will
only receive an account statement if there are changes to your account. If you have questions or
problems with your pay after retirement, you may call 1-800-525-0104 for assistance.

                     PCS-RELATED ENTITLEMENTS FACT SHEET

NOTE: SOME OF THE FOLLOWING ENTITLEMENTS OR ALLOWANCES REQUIRE
SPECIAL AUTHORIZATION; THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD CONTACT THE POC
BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION.
TOPIC 1: ADVANCE PAY
DISCUSSION: Military members may receive an advance of basic pay to assist with PCS
expenses. The advance is normally limited to 1 month of basic pay (less deductions) but can be
up to 3 months of basic pay (less deductions) with adequate justification and approval from your
commander.
POINT OF CONTACT: Financial Services Office (FSO)
TOPIC 2: HOUSING AND STATION ALLOWANCES
DISCUSSION: Members being assigned to a duty station in the United States may be paid Basic
Allowance for Housing (BAH) and a CONUS Cost-of-Living Allowance (COLA) to help defray
costs in that area. Members assigned to Alaska or Hawaii receive BAH and OCONUS COLA.
BAH is based on the member’s permanent duty station (PDS). The intent of BAH is to provide
uniformed servicemembers housing compensation based on comparable civilian costs of
housing. BAH is based on pay grade, dependency status, and location. It’s designed as a partial
reimbursement to assist our people in securing affordable off-base housing. Members assigned
to an OCONUS PDS may be paid Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) and OCONUS COLA.
OHA is based on rental costs, pay grade, dependency status and location. BAH and OHA may
be paid in advance to assist the member in securing adequate housing.
POINTS OF CONTACT: Financial Services Office and Housing Management Office
TOPIC 3: FAMILY SEPARATION ALLOWANCE (FSA) AND FAMILY SEPARATION
HOUSING (FSH)
DISCUSSION: FSH (See DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, "Military Pay Policy and Procedures
Active Duty and Reserve Pay," Chapter 27) is payable to a member who is on permanent duty at
a location to which movement of dependents is not authorized at the expense of the United
States, the member’s dependents do not reside at or near the location; and government quarters
are not available for assignment to the member. FSH is based on the single housing allowance
authorized for the member’s PDS.
FSA is intended to help defray the expenses associated with being separated from dependents to
include normal maintenance around the dependents’ household that would normally be
performed by the military member. A member who voluntarily elects the unaccompanied tour in
an area where an accompanied tour is authorized is not normally authorized FSA. Members who
must serve an overseas unaccompanied PCS assignment because of denied dependent travel can
apply for a Secretarial Waiver for payment of FSA at their local FSO prior to departing on the
assignment. Since FSA payments are effective upon date granted, payment can only be made
after the authorization. Retroactive payments are not authorized. Members who delay
application will have to apply for a correction to their records to receive retroactive payments.

POINT OF CONTACT: Financial Services Office
TOPIC 4: DISLOCATION ALLOWANCE (DLA)
DISCUSSION: DLA is authorized to partially reimburse a member with or without dependents
for expenses associated with relocating a household in conjunction with a PCS move to include
base closure or re-alignment of a military installation. DLA payments are based on the grade
and dependency status on the effective date of the PCS orders. Single members, military couples
without dependents and members who do not relocate their dependents are authorized DLA at
the without-dependent rate when they complete a PCS move, but only if they are not assigned to
government quarters at their new permanent duty station. Only one member of a military couple
is authorized DLA, unless they PCS separately and are required to maintain two separate
households (see your FSO for more information). DLA rates are contained in the JFTR, Chapter
5, Part G. NOTE: DLA is not authorized on the last move.
POINT OF CONTACT: Financial Services Office
TOPIC 5: TRAVEL TIME
DISCUSSION: The amount of time an individual is authorized to travel from one location to
another in conjunction with a PCS/TDY move varies based on the transportation mode and the
distance (JFTR, paragraph U5160). It may also include authorized time for delivery or pick-up
of a privately-owned vehicle (POV) to and from a port or storage facility. (See below for
additional information).
POINT OF CONTACT: Financial Services Office
TOPIC 6: IN-PLACE AND CONSECUTIVE OVERSEAS TOUR LEAVE TRAVEL
(IPCOT/COT)
DISCUSSION: Unaccompanied/accompanied members and command-sponsored dependents
who accompany the member on both overseas tours may be authorized funded round-trip
transportation, not to exceed the cost to their home of record, when they serve another tour at the
same location or are assigned from one overseas duty station to another overseas duty station.
COT leave travel is to be performed between assignments unless the losing commander grants a
deferment based on mission requirements, preventing the member from taking at least 10 days
leave en route. The deferment does not prevent the losing commander from authorizing less than
10 non-COT leave days en route. The PCS orders must reflect the deferment. If the member is
authorized to defer their COT leave travel and more than 10 days leave are taken en route, the
COT leave travel has been used. Deferments are based on mission requirements and not on
member’s personal preference. If deferred, the COT leave travel must be initiated before the end
of the deferment period. NOTE: Failure to contact the CTO/TMO prior to making travel
arrangements could result in non-reimbursement of travel expenses. COT/IPCOT leave is
chargeable leave. The deferral of COT leave does not qualify or allow a member to carry more
than 60 days leave from one fiscal year to the next. Reimbursement for tour and cruise packages
is not authorized.

NOTE: Refer to Topic 9, Temporary Lodging Incident to a Permanent Change of Station
(TLA/TLE), and Topic 15, Member and Dependent Travel Allowances.
TOPIC 7: RETENTION OF GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED FAMILY HOUSING
DISCUSSION: The family of a sponsor assigned to an overseas dependent-restricted
remote/short tour or to an unaccompanied tour of 24 months or less who occupies government
quarters, including leased units in CONUS, Alaska, or Hawaii at the time of departure of the
sponsor, may continue to occupy those quarters until the sponsor returns or reports to the next
permanent duty station. Contact the Housing Management Office if you want your dependents
to continue residing in base housing.
POINT OF CONTACT: Housing Management Office
TOPIC 8: ADVANCE APPLICATIONS FOR MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING
DISCUSSION: Eligible personnel may submit an advance application for military family
housing at any time after they have received PCS or active duty orders. Within CONUS, the
effective date of an advance application is the first day of the month prior to the month in which
the member will arrive at the gaining installation (sign-in month). If PCSing to an overseas area,
the effective date of advance application is the first day of the month prior to month of the
departure date from CONUS, as stated in the PCS orders.
POINT OF CONTACT: Housing Management Office
TOPIC 9: TEMPORARY LODGING INCIDENT TO A PERMANENT CHANGE OF
STATION (TLA/TLE)
DISCUSSION: There are two separate allowances paid to partially reimburse members for the
added expenses incurred while occupying temporary lodging incident to a PCS move.
Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) applies to CONUS only and is payable for temporary
lodging occupied by member and dependents before departure from the old permanent duty
station and after arrival at the new permanent duty station when per diem is not otherwise
payable. A maximum rate of $180 per day is authorized for a total of 10 days; however, only 5
days are authorized if move is from CONUS to overseas. TLE is not payable at the last duty
station. The second allowance is Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA). TLA is authorized
overseas only and payable upon initial arrival (sign-in) pending completion of arrangements for
permanent living accommodations and immediately prior to departure (sign-out) from a
permanent duty station. TLA is usually paid in 15-day increments. Members must check with
government quarters at the PDS prior to obtaining off base quarters. Government quarters non-
availability information must be supplied on the TLE\TLA claim.
POINTS OF CONTACT: Housing Management Office (TLA)/Billeting (TLE) and Financial
Services Office
TOPIC 10: HOUSING RELOCATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (HRAP)
DISCUSSION: Installation family housing offices provide enhanced family housing relocation
assistance to servicemembers and their families. Family housing counselors provide counseling
on buying and selling a home, property management, and renting. The enhanced program will
also include providing destination area information while servicemembers are at their current
base of assignment.

POINT OF CONTACT: Housing Management Office
NOTE: Refer to Topic 2, Housing and Station Allowances, and Topic 16, Household Goods
(HHG) - Amount/Storage/Local Movement.
TOPIC 11: PERMISSIVE TDY (PTDY) FOR HOUSE HUNTING
DISCUSSION: Up to 8 days in conjunction with the PCS, or 10 days when not in conjunction
with the PCS, during which servicemembers are authorized to be temporarily absent from their
normal duties, mission permitting. Member must have statement of intent that says he/she plans
to occupy non-government housing or must have documentation that government housing will
not be available within 30 days of arrival at the new station. Losing commanders may authorize
up to 10 days for traveling to or in the vicinity of a new permanent duty station to secure off-base
housing prior to a PCS move (signing out). The gaining commander may approve up to 8 days
PTDY after signing in. PTDY may be authorized to relocate family members to a designated
place when going to an unaccompanied tour overseas. In this instance, the losing commander
authorizes up to 8 days PTDY. PTDY is non-chargeable leave. Member must keep records of
house-renting and purchasing efforts. PTDY ends when housing is secured. Additional absence
is charged as leave. PTDY is not authorized if member is returning to an established household,
even if intent is to move. Space-available travel is authorized. If PCSing with TDY en route,
losing commander may approve up to 8 days PTDY if member plans to house-hunt. The MPF
includes the following statement on the PCS orders, ―Member has authorization for (number not
to exceed 8) days PTDY for the purpose of house-hunting.‖ MPFs also use this statement on
PCS orders if the commander approves PTDY when member is authorized to relocate family
members to a designated place en route to or if member is returning from an overseas
unaccompanied tour.
POINT OF CONTACT: Military Personnel Flight
TOPIC 12: PROCEED TIME
DISCUSSION: A period of 4 consecutive days absence is authorized in conjunction with PCS
to/from an unaccompanied overseas assignment for individuals (regardless of marital status) who
relocate dependents and/or household goods.         It is not authorized on first PCS or
separation/retirement. Also, it is not permitted on close-proximity moves; it is designed to
accommodate off-base actions associated with relocation.
POINT OF CONTACT: Military Personnel Flight
TOPIC 13: DIRECTED TRAVEL ROUTING FOR PCS-ASSOCIATED TRAINING
DISCUSSION: To prevent a hardship, members may request a change to the directed travel
routing for PCS-related training. The travel options available are TDY en route to PCS, TDY
return/PCS, and PCS/TDY return.

NOTE: Refer to Topic 15, Member and Dependent Travel Allowances, Topic 17, Personally
Procured Moves, and Topic 18, Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) Shipment and Storage.
TOPIC 15: MEMBER AND DEPENDENT TRAVEL ALLOWANCES
DISCUSSION: There are three methods for accomplishing PCS travel: (1) government-
provided transportation, (2) reimbursement for personally procured commercial transportation
and (3) payment of monetary allowance in lieu of transportation when travel is by privately
owned conveyance. In addition to these allowances, members and dependents are authorized a
per diem allowance to cover the costs associated with meals and lodging during the authorized
travel time. When the member has a TDY en route, the member alone is authorized a per diem
allowance for the TDY period. Dependents are not authorized transportation allowances to and
from the TDY location. These allowances may be paid in advance. NOTE: Prior to procuring
any commercial transportation, contact the local TMO/CTO for guidance; failure to follow
established guidelines could result in non-reimbursement of travel expenses.
While the above outlines your basic travel allowances, you should consider some of the
following items prior to determining how and where you and/or your dependents will travel:
    - Use of more than two privately owned conveyances (POC) (to transport member and
    dependents) and authorization to be reimbursed (MPF)
    - Use a port of embarkation (or debarkation) other than the one closest to your duty station
    (TMO)
    - Taking leave in an overseas area and, therefore, requiring circuitous routing (don’t forget
    to ask about the restrictions on using foreign carriers) (TMO)
    - If serving an unaccompanied tour overseas, what are the travel options for dependents?
    (MPF)
    - New overseas duty station is in an area where dependents are authorized; when can they
    travel, concurrent or delayed? (MPF)

TOPIC 16:            HOUSEHOLD           GOODS        (HHG)-AMOUNT/STORAGE/LOCAL
MOVEMENT
DISCUSSION: Members making PCS moves are authorized the transportation of their HHG
within their prescribed weight allowance. In addition, temporary or non-temporary storage of
HHG may be authorized in conjunction with the move. For members ordered to occupy or
vacate government quarters, the transportation of HHG within the local area may be approved.
POINTS OF CONTACT: Traffic Management Office, Housing Management Office, for local
moves
TOPIC 17: PERSONALLY PROCURED MOVES
DISCUSSION: Members authorized transportation of household goods (HHG) at government
expense may obtain approval to move the HHG themselves and receive an incentive payment
(normally, 95 percent of what it would cost the government). To receive an incentive payment,

the member must obtain approval from TMO prior to the movement of HHG. If pre-approval is
not obtained, reimbursement may be based on actual expenses only.
POINTS OF CONTACT: Traffic Management Office, Financial Services Office
TOPIC 18: PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE (POV) SHIPMENT AND STORAGE
DISCUSSION: Members may be authorized to transport or store one POV at government
expense when they are assigned to/from an overseas duty station. There are, however, overseas
areas where such shipments are prohibited. In connection with POV shipments, the member is
authorized an allowance to deliver the POV to the port and to pick it up from the port. This
monetary allowance is for round-trip transportation as defined in the JFTR, paragraphs U5413
and U5468. Individuals are authorized allowable travel time to deliver and pick up their POVs.
When a POV is used, the allowable travel time is based on 350 miles per day, and when an
airline is used, the travel time is normally 1 day based on constructed air schedule. Permissive
TDY cannot be used for this type of travel.
POVs can be delivered to and/or picked up from a port:
    - Prior to departure from the previous station. Member receives the one-way monetary
    allowance and allowable travel time as explained above.
    - During the PCS. En route status includes travel days and chargeable leave if travel days
    are exceeded to port or permanent duty station.
    - After arrival at new duty station when POV is at port awaiting pick up. Member may
    proceed to port and receive the monetary allowance and allowable travel time as explained
    above.
    - Ensure the following documents are available:
              -- Valid military ID card
              -- Seven copies of PCS orders
             -- Power-of-attorney (if applicable) and DD Form 788, Private Vehicle
        Shipping Document for Automobile
              -- A complete set of keys and insurance papers, if applicable
For reimbursement, member submits PCS order, DD Form 788, and DD Form 1351, Travel
Voucher, to the Financial Services Office. Visit your local Traffic Management and Financial
Services Offices for further information.
A member may be authorized to store one POV when ordered to an OCONUS PDS to which
shipment of a POV is not permitted, or sent TDY on a contingency operation for more than 30
days. This does not allow for storage of more than one POV. Storage facility must be
government approved.

     INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION OF VA FORM 21-526, VETERANS’
   APPLICATION FOR COMPENSATION OR PENSION, BASED ON A SERVICE-
                       RELATED DISABILITY

This form is to be used when applying for benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs
(DVA) because of an injury, illness, or disease caused or aggravated by your military service. It
is important to note that the injury, illness or disease does not have to be directly related to your
duty to be considered ―service-connected.‖ Any illness, injury or disease that you received
medical attention for while on active duty should be listed. The DVA will make a determination
as to whether or not it is service-connected and will rate it accordingly. It is important to file a
claim for compensation at the time of separation or retirement. If you are awarded compensation
benefits, they might be retroactive to the day following separation. Also, if you do not file a
claim, your service medical records will be sent to the repository for storage.
Although this form is used for both applying for service-connected disability compensation and a
nonservice-connected pension based on your income or permanent and total disability, in all
likelihood, you will be applying for benefits based on your service-connected disability. The
questions relating to income, stocks, bonds, real estate and other property may be skipped. You
may line out the questions starting with Item 33A through 41G. However, if you believe you
might qualify for a pension based on your income and inability to maintain gainful employment,
you may complete all the entries on the form and submit it to the DVA with your medical
records. Please note, however, that retirees do not generally meet the strict income limitations
for a pension.
