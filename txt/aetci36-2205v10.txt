                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Introduction.
   1.1.1. AETC conducts undergraduate and graduate level helicopter pilot and career enlisted
   aviator flying training courses in the TH-1H. These training courses produce aircrew with
   introductory, advanced undergraduate, basic, or instructor qualification applicable in the TH-
   1H aircraft and mission. Each flying training course syllabus outlines graduation status,
   course entry prerequisites, and provides a summary of training. The Education and Training
   Course Announcements (ETCA) Website, https://etca.randolph.af.mil/, also provides
   student administration and processing information. The following training is conducted by
   the 23 FTS at Fort Rucker, AL.
   1.1.2. Undergraduate level flying training; Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) Rotary-Wing
   Fundamentals (CEARF), provides enlisted aircrew students with initial skills training for
   follow on graduate level training at the formal training units (FTUs).
   1.1.3. Undergraduate level flying; Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training – Helicopter
   (SUPT-H), provides Air Force qualified helicopter and instrument rated pilots for follow-on
   graduate level training at FTUs.
   1.1.4. Graduate level flying pilot and flight engineer qualification courses including: Pilot
   Instructor Training (PIT) and Flight Engineer Instructor Training to support FTU production;
   Rotary Wing Fundamentals (RWF) to transition previously qualified fixed wing pilots to a
   helicopter qualification; and Pilot Qualification (PQ) to train helicopter pilots specifically for
   TH-1H qualification.
1.2. Specific Use. For the purposes of this instruction, there are four categories of students
enrolled in flying training: undergraduate and graduate pilots and CEAs.
   1.2.1. SUPT-H students. Students enrolled in the advanced phase (helicopter) of SUPT.
   1.2.2. Graduate pilot students. Pilots enrolled in training may either be fixed-wing
   qualified pilots enrolled in the RWF course or helicopter-qualified pilots enrolled in TH-1H
   PQ or PIT.
   1.2.3. CEARF students. Initial CEA students who have not successfully completed an
   aircraft mission qualification evaluation. Initial CEA students enrolled in CEARF training
   are in conditional aviation career status.
   1.2.4. Qualified/Previously Qualified CEA. Qualified CEAs are 23 FTS permanent party
   assigned or attached personnel who have previously completed formal flying training (i.e.
   have received a mission qualification in-flight evaluation with an AF Form 8, Certificate of
   Aircrew Qualification, AF Form 8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft),
   or AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation, on file.
1.3. Casual Officer Student Management. Casual officer students are those in a permanent
change of station (PCS) status who have reported to 23 FTS and are awaiting training or have
completed training.
 6                                                           AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


     1.3.1. 23 FTS commander (CC) manages all casual officer students.
     1.3.2. 23 FTS/CC or designated supervisor will place SUPT-H eliminees on casual status
     until they depart the base for a PCS.
     1.3.3. 23 FTS/CC will ensure casual officer students are ready to start scheduled training,
     provide continuing professional development, and motivate students for their flying careers.
     1.3.4. Duty Hours. Casual student duty supervisors are responsible for maintaining
     accountability of casual students during all duty periods.
     1.3.5. Mentoring. All casual students will be present for mentoring sessions set by their 23
     FTS supervisor, as required.
     1.3.6. Squadron Commander Calls/Safety Meetings. Casual students attend all 23
     FTS/CC calls and safety meetings unless their duty is mission critical and their absence is
     coordinated with their 23 FTS supervisor.
     1.3.7. Letter of Evaluation (LOE). Duty supervisors of casual students are highly
     encouraged to complete an optional LOE, which is the appropriate tool to capture a casual
     student’s performance. While the optional LOE is not filed in the selection record, it
     provides performance information to the subsequent rater for consideration when
     accomplishing the follow-on report (training or evaluation report). Officers may include
     their LOE in a letter to the board (for example, central selection board, force-shaping board,
     etc.), if convened prior to their next evaluation. In addition to LOEs, excellent performance
     can be documented with a decoration that will become a part of the selection record. By
     completing optional LOEs, a level playing field is maintained among all students, regardless
     of casual status duties. LOEs and decorations will be routed through the 23 FTS supervisor
     for 23 FTS/CC recommendation and approval.
     1.3.8. Leave. Casual students will coordinate leave and pass requests through their duty
     supervisor prior to submitting them for approval.
     1.3.9. Physical Training (PT). Casual students will participate in the 23 FTS fitness
     program.
     1.3.10. Supervisors. The 23 FTS will supervise SUPT-H eliminees until they PCS from the
     base. During each transfer of supervisory responsibilities, the losing supervisor will brief the
     gaining supervisor on each student’s progress, potential, and any problems affecting the
     student’s training.
1.4. Course Entry Administration. 23 FTS will review incoming student records to verify
they are complete. Students must meet course entry prerequisites established in the syllabus. If
a student does not meet the course entry prerequisites, contact AETC/A3FP before entering the
student into training. As a minimum, 23 FTS will review the following student records (or their
equivalents) prior to any formal training:
     1.4.1. Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Records. These records are maintained in
     the flight evaluation folder (FEF). Depending on aircrew specialty, some individuals may
     not yet possess an FEF. Students should hand-carry FEFs to training according to the ETCA
     course requirements. If required, 23 FTS forwards applicable AF Form 8 and other
     standardization and evaluation records and documents to the student’s home or gaining unit
     upon completion of training.
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                    7


   1.4.2. Training Folders or Records from Previous Courses. Students will hand-carry
   flight records, if applicable, to training according to ETCA guidance. Depending on Air
   Force Specialty Code (AFSC), some individuals may not yet possess individual flight
   records.    If SUPT-H student training records are not available, contact AETC/A3FP.
   NOTE: Center of Excellence (CoE) students hand-carry sealed training records to their
   follow-on training locations. If CEARF student records are not available, contact 344
   TRS/COE.
   1.4.3. Training Summaries and Student Biographies. The squadron commander
   (SQ/CC), squadron operations officer (SQ/DO), flight commander (FLT/CC), squadron
   resource manager (SQ/RM) or designated representative should review all training
   summaries and student biographies included in the student training record.
1.5. Quota Management. The programmed flying training (PFT) document establishes the
baseline for student quota management, which reflects real-time changes and are the AETC
aircrew training primary source documents for class entry dates, student load, and production
schedule information. AETC/A3RA maintains the quota management worksheets. These
worksheets are available at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AE-57/default.aspx (NOTE:
To gain access to the sharepoint website, copy and paste web address into the browser). AETC
provides class quotas annually via electronic PFT pages. AETC/A3RA notifies 23 FTS when
quotas change.
   1.5.1. 23 FTS should obtain class entry rosters from the Military Personnel Data System
   Oracle Training Administration or the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System
   not later than two weeks before class entry. Obtain rosters as early as possible to allow
   identification of excess capacity.
   1.5.2. 23 FTS will report roster discrepancies as soon as they are discovered but no later than
   three duty days following the class start date. Report changes, discrepancies, and completion
   or graduation delays to AETC/A3RA, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)/DPPAO,
   AFPC/DPAOM4 and AETC/A3FP. In addition, report officer graduation delays and changes
   impacting track/aircraft assignment to AFPC/DPALT.
1.6. Production Metrics Report. AETC/A3RB is the point of contact (POC) for flying training
production metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, AETC/A3RB uploads the PFT
document to the flying training production analysis (FTPA) web-based input tool. The OG/CC
or designated POC will update the FTPA with actual entries, gains, losses, attritions, graduate
numbers and NOTEs, if applicable. These updates are due five duty days after the class start
date and class completion/graduation date.
1.7. Academic Training Scheduling. Students do not receive more than eight hours of testable
classroom and computer-assisted instruction for academic subjects per day. Examinations are
considered testable material.
1.8. Special Reporting Procedures for ANG and AFRC Students. 23 FTS/CC will ensure
the following actions are taken:
   1.8.1. For ANG or AFRC Students Experiencing Difficulty: 23 FTS will notify
   AETC/A3G (for ANG) or AETC/A3H (for AFRC), as appropriate, via electronic mail (E-
   mail) when an ANG or AFRC student requires a progress check (PC) or an elimination check
   (EC), enters the commander’s review (CR) process, is placed on administrative hold, or is
 8                                                         AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


     eliminated from or reinstated in training. In addition, notify AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as
     appropriate, when a student washes back a class or there is reasonable doubt about a
     student’s potential to complete a training syllabus. Include the student’s home unit and
     National Guard Bureau (NGB)/A3O or NGB/A3OC, or AFRC/A3TB, as applicable, as
     addressees on the E-mails.
     1.8.2. Completion/Graduation Notification. If PFT completion/graduation dates change,
     23 FTS will notify the student’s home unit and NGB/A3OC or AFRC/A3TB of the student’s
     new completion/graduation date by E-mail no later than 30 calendar days before the new
     date. When it appears a student may graduate late, notify the student’s home unit as soon as
     possible. Send an information copy to AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate.
1.9. Physical Training (PT) Program. Students participate in a scheduled PT program
according to the appropriate syllabus; Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2905, Fitness Program.
     1.9.1. Group (flight, class, etc.) physical training is highly encouraged to build esprit de
     corps, but it is not required. 23 FTS will document PT accomplishments and ensure
     compliance by each student.
     1.9.2. All SUPT-H students will take the Fitness Assessment (FA) according to AFI 36-
     2905. Students will not graduate, nor be awarded an aviation rating without a current
     Excellent/Satisfactory score. In addition to the requirements in AFI 36-2905, continue
     students with an Unsatisfactory FA score in training, but place them on administrative hold
     prior to class graduation. These students will either pass the FA and graduate, or be
     eliminated from training through a CR. The unit will notify AETC/A3FP if a student does
     not pass the FA by the scheduled class graduation date (reference paragraph 1.10.1).
     1.9.3. Students enrolled in temporary duty (TDY) flying training courses must maintain
     fitness standards according to AFI 36-2905. They are encouraged to participate in host unit
     programs or complete three sessions of physical training per week.
1.10. Administrative Hold. 23 FTS will place students on administrative hold whose training
has been suspended for other than medical reasons for more than seven calendar days. 23 FTS
should use administrative hold judiciously for extenuating circumstances, to include family
serious illness or death, or other personal problems beyond the individual’s control. 23 FTS will
notify the host aviation resource management (HARM) office and the registrar of all
administrative hold actions. The registrar will update the student’s status in Military Personnel
Data System Oracle Training Administration (if required) to reflect the student status codes.
Refer to AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, Formal Aircrew Training Administration and Management,
for administrative hold procedures for medical reasons.

                                          Chapter 2

                                    TRAINING FOLDER

2.1. Introduction:
   2.1.1. Each student will have a training folder. The training folder will consist of the
   electronic GTIMS training folder and other required training documents not maintained in
   GTIMS. If a backup version of the GTIMS training folder is maintained, the unit will
   address procedures in local unit guidance. A student may only access his or her own training
   folder.
   2.1.2. In addition to the training folder, the FLT/CC or Flight Chief (for CEARF) will
   maintain personal information folders (if required) on students to protect information of a
   personal nature, inappropriate for public access, or sensitive in nature, and thus not
   appropriate for the training folder. Use AF Form 174, Record of Individual Counseling, or
   AETC Form 173, Student Record of Academic/Nonacademic Counseling and Comments, to
   record counseling entries maintained in the personal information folder. Annotate on an AF
   Form 4293, Student Activity Record, in the student’s training folder when a counseling
   session is conducted.
   2.1.3. The FLT/CC or Flight Chief will ensure training folders and personal information
   folders are secured to prevent unauthorized access.
   2.1.4. Instructors will ensure each aircraft, aircrew training device (ATD), and academic and
   ground training event is recorded in the training folder.
   2.1.5. 23 FTS will establish procedures to conduct periodic student training folder reviews to
   ensure accurate and complete documentation of each student’s training.
2.2. Contents. Include the following items in the training folder, as applicable. A GTIMS
write-up in the Documents Tab for first recorded training event record (event ID: POC-1) will
substitute for all AETC Form 101, Student Performance Summary, and AF Form 4293
requirements. All write-ups will utilize memorandum for record format, and address all areas of
respective forms.
   2.2.1. AETC Form 101. (GTIMS)
   2.2.2. AF Form 4293. (GTIMS)
   2.2.3. Academic examination grades summary. (GTIMS)
   2.2.4. Grade sheets. (GTIMS)
       2.2.4.1. Instructors will provide postflight comments in the comment column of the
       grade sheet on individual maneuvers. Write comments in a way that provides continuity
       from one instructor to the next and alerts instructor s to the areas and objectives they
       should concentrate on for the ensuing sortie. As a minimum, provide comments for any
       maneuver graded below a previously required maneuver item file (MIF) proficiency level
       unless already documented on an AF Form 4293. For graduate training courses,
       postflight comments are required only on items graded below MIF, if in the instructor’s
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                  11


       judgment the student may have difficulty meeting MIF by the end of the unit. Ensure
       comments are consistent with assigned grades and the course training standards (CTS).
       2.2.4.2. As a minimum, under the Comments tab in GTIMS, instructors will include the
       mission profile, overall assessment of the student’s characteristic performance, and any
       recommendations for the next instructor.
   2.2.5. CR paperwork.
   2.2.6. Messages (ANG and AFRC, if applicable).
   2.2.7. Student officer’s biography (optional).
   2.2.8. Student résumé. (GTIMS)
   2.2.9. Grade report for each category and training medium. (GTIMS)
   2.2.10. Record of emergency procedure (EP) training. (GTIMS)
   2.2.11. Record of special syllabus requirement accomplishment. (GTIMS)
2.3. Documentation. Accurate documentation of the student’s performance is a core
competency and integral to the student training process. Failure to do so places the integrity of
the training program at risk, fails to portray an accurate picture of the student’s actual
performance, and improperly influences class ranking. Instructors will use an AF Form 4293 (or
GTIMS equivalent) to document student training according to the applicable syllabus and this
instruction. Include all AF Forms 4293 in the student’s training folder. Instructors will provide
a concise summary of the student’s training and ensure entries clarify any training action. Begin
each entry with date of the event, subject or syllabus lesson numbers, overall lesson grade, and
lesson duration (if applicable). End each entry with the name, grade, and duty title of the
instructor making the entry. The student and the FLT/CC or Flight Chief must initial all entries.
Documentation is required for the following:
   2.3.1. Administrative hold.
   2.3.2. Temporary medical disqualification (DNIF status). 23 FTS may substitute a scanned
   or electronic copy of the AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
   Operational Duty or DA Form 4186, Medical Recommendation for Flying Duty in the
   GTIMS training folder for the AF Form 4293 entry.
   2.3.3. Failure of any academic examination, category check, flight evaluation, PC or EC.
   2.3.4. Counseling session.
   2.3.5. Assignment to and removal from the commander’s awareness program (CAP).
   2.3.6. Training folder review prior to a PC, EC, or CR. The reviewing instructor will
   document any training anomalies, syllabus deviations, etc that were not previously
   documented.
   2.3.7. Incomplete lessons.
   2.3.8. Authorization to proficiency advance out of a unit and reallocation of sorties to
   another unit.
   2.3.9. Authorization for additional training (AT). The authorization authority will identify
   the reasons for an AT sortie and sign or initial the entry.
 12                                                        AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


   2.3.10. Substandard performance occurring on an AT sortie.
   2.3.11. Results of the training review for students projected to exceed the syllabus maximum
   flying hour or sortie threshold.
   2.3.12. Entry into the CR process and elimination from or reinstatement into training.
   2.3.13. Syllabus deviations.
   2.3.14. Syllabus entry prerequisite waiver or syllabus waiver (required if AETC Form 6,
   Waiver Request, is not included in the electronic training folder).
   2.3.15. Airsickness or manifestation of apprehension (MOA) episodes.
   2.3.16. Unusual occurrences that could affect the student’s progress.
   2.3.17. Lessons graded overall fair (F) or unsatisfactory (U). Instructors will identify and
   document all maneuvers graded below a previously required MIF and any weak areas that
   need to be highlighted using the cause-and-effect format to document the substandard
   performance and identify the root cause. Each MIF item will be addressed separately. Do
   not use a MIF item to justify a downgrade of other MIF item(s) without a corresponding
   down grade of the first MIF item. Avoid bundling multiple MIF items under a single MIF
   item.
   2.3.18. Training folder closeout statement. Include a closeout statement in every training
   folder. If the student was eliminated/withdrawn from training, state so in the statement. In
   addition for SUPT-H and CEARF students, include the student’s major weapon system
   (MWS) assignment.
2.4. Student Training Records Disposition. Maintain student training records according to the
Air Force RDS. A student usually obtains his or her training records during outprocessing and
hand-carries them to his or her gaining unit. If the record is incomplete when the graduate
departs, 23 FTS will forward the training record to the gaining unit via certified mail or E-mail
within 10 duty days of the student’s completion/graduation. 23 FTS will use appropriate E-mail
encryption features to properly safeguard information sent electronically and will verify the
electronic file is received. Refer to Table 2.1 for appropriate distribution of training documents,
including forms, records, and reports. Upon completion of training or disenrollment, 23 FTS
will maintain the student’s records according to AETCI 36-2223, Flying Training Student
Information Management.

  Day-to-day CAP administration may be delegated to the 23 FTS/DO, squadron assistant
  operations officer (23 FTS/ADO), FLT/CC, flight supervisor, or designated student training
  manager, but the 23 FTS/CC maintains overall authority and responsibility. Class
  commanders may place students on military CAP if specifically authorized in local guidance.
  3.1.4. Local Guidance. 23 FTS will develop specific CAP guidance as it relates to the
  unit’s mission. As a minimum, this guidance will address criteria for different CAP
  categories, student or training activity restrictions, instructor continuity requirements,
  placement procedures, and removal procedures.
  3.1.5. CAP Procedures. The 23 FTS/CC, FLT/CC, or Flight Chief places the student on
  CAP and removes the student from CAP when sustained normal progress is demonstrated or
  when personal issues are resolved. The 23 FTS/CC will be briefed prior to removing a
  student from CAP. Although CAP is intended to be a short-term program (one to two
  weeks), removal should not be strictly event based (for example, passing a category check) if
  the student’s weak areas can carry over into the next unit or category. A student requiring an
  extended period of increased supervision or repeated placement on CAP should be
  considered for a PC or EC.
     3.1.5.1. While the student is on CAP, tailor training to address the student’s particular
     situation within the limits of the syllabus. Contractor-provided training is conducted
     according to the training contract. The FLT/CC or Flight Chief will closely monitor
     instructor continuity and ensure proficiency standards are not compromised to permit
     CAP students to progress in training.
     3.1.5.2. The immediate supervisor will counsel the student when placed on and removed
     from CAP. Initial counseling will cover CAP objectives, student training plan, instructor
     continuity, and CAP removal goals. Additional counseling is done at the discretion of the
     immediate supervisor but is required if the student fails to meet the CAP removal goals.
 16                                                      AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


       The supervisor updates goals appropriately and documents all counseling in the student’s
       training folder.
       3.1.5.3. The student’s immediate supervisor will brief squadron leadership weekly on the
       student’s progress. As a minimum, this briefing will include the student’s strong and
       weak areas, AT details, potential to graduate, and anticipated removal date from CAP.
3.2. Progress Checks and Elimination Checks. PCs/ECs are full mission-profile sorties
during which a student’s performance is observed, rated potential is evaluated, and ability to
complete the course within syllabus constraints is considered. Conduct PCs/ECs according to
the applicable syllabus. PCs/ECs are separate from the normal syllabus flow. Students must
demonstrate proficiency on the PC/EC to the current stage of training. PCs/ECs are key events
in the CR process. Triggers for these events are defined in the applicable syllabus.
   3.2.1. Authorized PC/EC instructors. Only duly appointed and qualified instructors will
   administer a PC/EC. Refer to the applicable syllabus for authorized PC/EC instructors.
   Normally do not fly the student with the same PC/EC instructor on consecutive and/or
   subsequent PC/EC sorties.
   3.2.2. Ground Evaluation. PC/EC ground evaluations may be conducted as a result of a
   failed category check/PC/EC for unsatisfactory general knowledge, ground operations,
   mission planning or EPs, or as the result of a FLT/CC or Flight Chief-directed evaluation for
   failure to progress or meet syllabus standards in procedural knowledge. These evaluations
   may include a simulator mission.
       3.2.2.1. The designated PC/EC instructor will conduct the entire briefing, ground
       evaluation execution, debriefing, and assign the overall grade.
       3.2.2.2. The ground evaluation should be one to two hours in length and of sufficient
       breadth and depth to evaluate the student’s overall procedural knowledge.
   3.2.3. Simulator:
       3.2.3.1. The PC/EC instructor will not substitute a simulator PC/EC for a syllabus-
       directed aircraft sortie.
       3.2.3.2. Simulators provide valuable training to prepare students for actual aircraft
       missions; however, consider a student for an aircraft PC when he or she is identified by
       repeated failures or lack of progress in an instrument simulator. If a student pilot
       progresses to an EC in an instrument simulator unit, the EC should be accomplished in
       the aircraft (other than general knowledge or procedural issues best handled by an EC
       ground evaluation or emergency procedure simulator). SUPT-H Only: A student pilot
       should not be eliminated in an instrument simulator training unit if he or she has not
       flown an instrument aircraft sortie.
   3.2.4. Grading. Grade PCs/ECs according to syllabus guidance.
   3.2.5. Incomplete PC/EC. The PC/EC instructor determines if the sortie is complete. A
   PC/EC is “Incomplete” only if the mission tasks and objectives could not be completed to
   ascertain a reasonable evaluation of student performance.
   3.2.6. Continuation Training (CT) Meetings. The 23 FTS/CC or designated PC/EC
   instructor will conduct PC/EC instructor CT meetings at least quarterly to ensure command
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                   17


   and squadron PC/EC philosophy is implemented and standardized. As a minimum, each
   meeting should include a review of pass and fail rates by individual PC/EC instructors over
   the last quarter and year-to-date, quarterly and annual PC/EC pass and fail rates by category,
   and at least one grading scenario brought to a conclusion and documented in the meeting
   minutes. Grading scenarios should generate thoughtful discussion and reference to the
   individual CTS appropriate for the scenario. Document the meetings in enough detail to
   allow those who were unable to attend to read, initial the meeting minutes, and understand
   what transpired.
3.3. Commander’s Review Process:
   3.3.1. Overview. The CR recommends the student’s elimination or retention in training.
   All students in a formal flying training course will go through a CR before being eliminated
   or removed from training. Complete the CR process within 10 duty days from the date the
   initiating authority (IA) signs one of the following forms:
      3.3.1.1. AETC Form 126A, Record of Commander’s Review Action.
      3.3.1.2. AETC Form 126G, Record of Commander’s Review Action (Graduate Flying
      Training).
      3.3.1.3. AETC Form 139, Record of Commander’s Review Action (Undergraduate Pilot
      Training).
      3.3.1.4. AETC Form 140, Record of Commander’s Review Action (Instructor Pilot
      Training)
   3.3.2. Entry. Each course syllabus provides CR process triggers. The IA will enter the
   student in the CR process not later than three duty days after meeting the syllabus trigger.
   Remove the student from training pending final approving authority (AA) decision. The IA
   may elect to continue the student in academic training with reviewing authority (RA)
   concurrence. Instruct SUPT-H or CEA students not to attend flight line activities (aircraft or
   simulator) until reinstated. Students projected to exceed the syllabus maximum sortie or
   flying hour threshold because of overall poor performance should be considered for a CR. If
   the syllabus does not identify a maximum threshold, use 115 percent as a guide.
   3.3.3. IA. The 23 FTS/CC conducting the student’s syllabus training is the IA. The IA will:
      3.3.3.1. Notify the student in writing of his or her consideration for elimination and brief
      the student on the CR process (Figure 3.1). For ANG and AFRC students, refer to
      paragraph 1.8.1.1
      3.3.3.2. Complete the IA portion of the Commander’s Review Checklist and Briefing
      Guide (Figure 3.2).
      3.3.3.3. Advises the student to submit a “show cause” memorandum within 2 work days,
      identifying any factors that may have affected training.
   3.3.4. Reviewing Authority (RA). The OG/CC is the RA. The RA will:
      3.3.4.1. Review the student’s training and recommends elimination from or retention in
      training. The OG/CC may delegate this authority to the deputy operations group
      commander (OG/CD), operations support Squadron/CC, or any 58 OG FTS/CC (not to
      include the 23 FTS/CC). In the case of the 58 OG this would include the 58TRSS/CC,
18                                                    AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


     71SOS/CC, 512 RQS/CC and 550SOS/CC. The RA will examine the student’s training
     records and, as deemed necessary, interview the student and FLT/CC or 23 FTS/CC.
     3.3.4.2. Complete the RA portion of the CR Checklist (Figure 3.2).
     3.3.4.3. Suspend the CR if it becomes apparent that circumstances require convening an
     investigation under the provisions of AFI 51-602, Boards of Officers, or when
     information arises that would cause the student to be medically disqualified. Reconvene
     as appropriate to complete the CR process.
  3.3.5. Approving Authority (AA). The WG/CC is the AA. The AA will:
     3.3.5.1. Complete the AA portion of the CR Checklist (Figure 3.2).
     3.3.5.2. List any authorized AT on AETC Form 126A, AETC Form 126G, AETC Form
     139 or AETC Form 140, as applicable.
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                           19

      3.3.5.3. Do not recommend SUPT-H eliminees for entry into any other SUPT or ENJJPT
      training. Additionally, the AA will not recommend students eliminated for MOA, drop
      on request (DOR), or academics for any other flying training. The AA should consider
      the student’s motivation, situational awareness, task management skills, airmanship, and
      academic average when recommending eliminees for Combat System Officer (CSO),
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                    21


      Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), or Air Battle Management training provided they still
      meet required medical standards.
NOTE: SUPT-H students with aeronautical rating cannot DOR and fall under the procedures in
AFI 11-402.
   3.3.5.4. CEARF students who fail to satisfy the requirements of E-A9H-A are subject to
   retraining/reclassification guidance in accordance with AFI 36-2626 and AFI 11-402. If the
   IA recommends retention of the student in a CEA capacity; an AETC Form 125A Record of
   Administrative Training Action, will be sent to the CEA Career Field Manager at HAF/A3O
   through AETC/A3ZS for consideration and alignment for further CEA training.
3.4. Student Eliminations:
   3.4.1. Students will be considered for elimination if they:
      3.4.1.1. Exhibit lack of adaptability (LOA), which is the inability to complete the course
      because of physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an
      evaluation from both medical and rated personnel. This category includes airsickness
      and MOA. Medical and rated personnel conducting the evaluations will document the
      results in the student’s training folder. They will specify the physical, psychological, or
      personality factors that led to the LOA determination. In addition, they will annotate
      specific deficiencies in Section IV of AETC Form 126A, AETC Form 126G, AETC
      Form 139 or AETC Form 140.
      3.4.1.2. Fail to meet proficiency standards of the syllabus in flying, academics, or
      procedures.
      3.4.1.3. Fail to demonstrate the potential to complete the course within syllabus
      constraints.
      3.4.1.4. Engage in misconduct punishable under the articles of the Uniform Code of
      Military Justice (UCMJ).
      3.4.1.5. Fail to meet fitness standards prescribed in AFI 36-2905 and this publication.
      3.4.1.6. Demonstrate improper conduct, attitude, or lack of responsibility toward
      assigned duties or obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt
      about the student’s fitness for continued service. 58 SOW/CC should contact AETC/A3F
      for guidance in specific situations.
   3.4.2. Students will be eliminated if they:
      3.4.2.1. DOR (SUPT-H only). The FLT/CC will counsel the student on the
      ramifications of DOR (i.e., permanent disqualification from flying status and possible
      reclassification proceeding) prior to entering him or her into a CR. Once the student is
      counseled and signs the AETC Form 139, he or she is ineligible for reinstatement.
      NOTE: SUPT-H students with aeronautical rating cannot DOR and fall under the
      procedures in AFI 11-402.
      3.4.2.2. DOR (CEA only). No DOR option exists for CEARF students. Provisions in
      AFI 11-402 apply. Depending on the needs of the Air Force, CEARF students who
      attempt to DOR will be eliminated from training and may be removed from the USAF.
      The CEARF Superintendent and Flight Chief will counsel the student on the
 22                                                         AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


       ramifications of DOR (i.e., permanent disqualification from flying status and possible
       removal from the service) prior to entering him or her into a CR. Once the student is
       counseled and signs the AETC Form 126A, he or she is ineligible for reinstatement.
       3.4.2.3. Become medically disqualified, unless a flight surgeon determines the
       disqualification may resolve within 12 months of the initial disqualification. In the latter
       instance, place the student in administrative hold status. Refer to AFI 48-123, Medical
       Examinations and Standards, AETCI 48-102, and Chapter 4 of this publication for
       additional guidance.
NOTE: For those students funded under the TDY-to-school program, the assigned unit will
notify AETC/A3FP and AETC/FMAM as soon as the administrative hold status becomes
probable.
       3.4.2.4. Initiate action to separate from the service.
       3.4.2.5. Get involved in drug abuse substantiated by reliable evidence.
       3.4.2.6. Get adjudicated absent without leave, are confined, or have deserted.
       3.4.2.7. Become hospitalized for an extended period (as determined by the WG/CC).
       Student may be considered for reinstatement at a later date.
       3.4.2.8. Demonstrate improper attitude or lack of responsibility toward assigned duties or
       obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt about the student’s
       fitness for training.
       3.4.2.9. Fail two ECs in the same phase or fail three ECs total (applies only to SUPT-H).
       AETC/A2/3/10 is waiver authority for this requirement.
   3.4.3. Students will be disenrolled if they get recalled by the parent unit or higher
   headquarters. NOTE: 23 FTS will not allow students to be recalled without prior
   coordination with AETC/A3F.
   3.4.4. AETC/A3 staff will maintain entry, production and elimination data to ensure fairness
   and equitable opportunity for all flying training program candidates.
3.5. Student Dispositions:
   3.5.1. Students reinstated into training after a CR will complete a PC or EC (as appropriate)
   following completion of any AT authorized by the AA in Section IV of AETC Form 126A,
   AETC Form 126G, AETC Form 139 or AETC Form 140. Students reinstated after academic
   deficiencies must repeat the examination after appropriate AT. Students reinstated following
   a flight evaluation board will complete AT directed by the final approval authority.
   3.5.2. After completing AETC Form 126A, AETC Form 126G, AETC Form 139 or AETC
   Form 140, Section IV, 23 FTS will process eliminated students under AFI 36-3206,
   Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, AFI 36-3207; Separating
   Commissioned Officers, AFI 36-2110, or the ETCA. Additionally, 23 FTS will process rated
   pilots and SUPT-H students with an aeronautical rating according to AFI 11-402; and
   pipeline or PCS students through appropriate personnel channels.
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                              23


3.6. CR Records Distribution:
   3.6.1. The school registrar or similarly designated authority will maintain original CR
   records according to the RDS and distribute them within 10 duty days of CR completion.
   These records must be available for review.
   3.6.2. 23 FTS will distribute eliminated students’ CR records as outlined in Table 3.1 and
   maintain them according to the RDS.
   3.6.3. The course registrar will ensure each elimination case is updated in the training
   management database with an elimination code.
   3.6.4. The servicing flight management office will update ARMS with the appropriate
   disqualification code.

                      MEDICAL MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

4.1. General. This chapter establishes student management requirements for appropriate
medical and operations personnel. Operations and medical personnel will ensure 23 FTS/CC is
informed when students exhibit MOA symptoms or other medical conditions that affect student
decisions. Supervisors must strive to keep students motivated and flying on a regular basis.
4.2. Airsickness. Instructors will document the student’s training record when a student
experiences any form of airsickness. Comply with AETCI 362205, Volume 1. If airsickness
leads to significant deviation from training profile or prevents the student from meeting MIF
requirements, the student will be referred to the flight surgeon (FS) for evaluation according to
AFI 48123 and AETCI 48-102. This will be accomplished prior the next flight. Comply with
provisions in the USASAM – AETC/A3F Memorandum of Understanding titled: US Army
Support to USAF Trainees Requiring Airsickness Management Training.
   4.2.1. Airsickness Procedures for SUPT-H Students:
       4.2.1.1. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training. Early in the
       contact phase of SUPT-H, the instructor may help students overcome the impacts of
       airsickness by changing the profile, momentarily taking control of the aircraft, or if
       necessary, terminating the mission when airsickness symptoms persist. Use sortie
       termination as a last resort since continued exposure to the flight environment enhances
       physiological adaptation. As students progress in training, instructor assistance
       decreases. During the last four sorties (C1601-1604) preceding Contact Team Solo
       (C1701), instructors may offer only minimal assistance.
       4.2.1.2. FLT/CCs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
       airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
       practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. Document all episodes of
       airsickness on AF Form 4293.
       4.2.1.3. While participating in the airsickness management program (AMP), students
       will continue the normal syllabus flow to include flying. AMP is outlined in AETCI 48-
       102.
       4.2.1.4. The FLT/CC will place students who become airsick on four or more sorties on
       CAP.
       4.2.1.5. Instructors will grade students who occupy any pilot or copilot position and
       develop airsickness on any sortie as unsatisfactory overall. Students who experience
       airsickness while not occupying a pilot seat with access to flight controls (jump seat,
       passenger seat, etc.) may not necessarily warrant an overall grade of unsatisfactory. In
       this case, consider the inflight conditions, training accomplished, and whether or not the
       mission is terminated early to determine the final grade.
       4.2.1.6. Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties.
       Treatment must stop no later than four sorties prior to the Contact Team Solo (C1701).
       Medication is restricted to students flying in the pre-team solo phase of contact training.
26                                                      AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


     4.2.1.7. Following any airsickness episode, the student’s next flight must be with an
     instructor pilot (IP).
     4.2.1.8. After the third post-solo airsickness and every third episode thereafter, the 23
     FTS/CC will assess the student’s potential to complete training. If the student’s potential
     to graduate is high, the 23 FTS/CC will make an entry on the AF Form 4293 to continue
     the student in training. If the student’s potential to graduate is low, the CR process will
     determine whether the student is retained in or eliminated from training. Conduct student
     eliminations according to AETCI 48-102.
     4.2.1.9. Commanders will process rated officers in SUPT-H who cannot overcome
     airsickness problems according to AFI 48-123. Squadron supervisors should coordinate
     closely with the chief of aeromedical services (or Army equivalent for helicopter
     training) for each of these special cases.
  4.2.2. Airsickness Procedures for CEARF Students:
     4.2.2.1. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training. Early in CEARF
     training, the instructor may help students overcome the impacts of airsickness by
     changing the profile, requesting that the IP momentarily minimize excessive flight
     control input, allowing the student to remain on the ground for a minimal period (while
     operating in a traffic pattern or landing zone), or if necessary, terminating the mission
     when airsickness symptoms persist. Use sortie termination as a last resort since
     continued exposure to the flight environment enhances physiological adaptation. As
     students progress in training, instructor assistance decreases.
     4.2.2.2. Flight Chiefs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
     airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
     practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. Document all episodes of
     airsickness on AF Form 4293.
     4.2.2.3. While participating in AMP, students will continue the normal syllabus flow to
     include flying. AMP is outlined in AFI 48-123 and AETCI 48-102.
     4.2.2.4. The Flight Chief will place students who become airsick on four or more
     CEARF sorties on CAP.
     4.2.2.5. CEARF students who experience airsickness may not necessarily warrant an
     overall grade of unsatisfactory. Consider the inflight conditions, training accomplished,
     and whether or not the mission is terminated early to determine the final grade.
     4.2.2.6. Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties.
     Treatment must stop no later than five sorties prior to CEARF completion.
     4.2.2.7. After the third airsickness sortie and every third episode thereafter, the 23
     FTS/CC will assess the student’s potential to complete training. If the student’s potential
     to graduate is high, the 23 FTS/CC will make an entry on the AF Form 4293 to continue
     the student in training. If the student’s potential to graduate is low, the CR process will
     determine whether the student is retained in or eliminated from training. Conduct student
     eliminations according to AETCI 48-102.
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                  27


   4.2.3. Airsickness Procedures for Graduate Pilot Training Students:
       4.2.3.1. A student who experiences airsickness while not occupying a pilot seat with
       access to flight controls (jump seat, passenger seat, etc.) may not necessarily warrant an
       overall grade of unsatisfactory. In this case, instructors should consider the inflight
       conditions, training accomplished, and whether or not the mission is terminated early to
       determine the final grade. They will use the applicable syllabus to grade students who
       occupy any pilot or copilot position and develop airsickness.
       4.2.3.2. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training.
       4.2.3.3. FLT/CCs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
       airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
       practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. Document all episodes of
       airsickness on AF Form 4293.
       4.2.3.4. While participating in AMP, students continue the normal syllabus flow to
       include flying. Limit student pharmacological therapy to a maximum of three sorties.
       4.2.3.5. Commanders will process rated officers who cannot overcome airsickness
       problems according to AFI 48-123 and AFI 11-402. Squadron supervisors should
       coordinate closely with the chief of aeromedical services for each of these special cases.
   4.2.4. Airsickness Procedures for Graduate CEA Training Students:
       4.2.4.1. A student who experiences airsickness may not necessarily warrant an overall
       grade of unsatisfactory. Instructors should consider the inflight conditions, training
       accomplished, and whether or not the mission is terminated early to determine the final
       grade.
       4.2.4.2. Students must meet MIF standards to continue flight training.
       4.2.4.3. Flight Chiefs and instructors will send students who experience active or passive
       airsickness to the flight surgeon for examination, counseling, and treatment as soon as
       practical and before the next aircraft or simulator sortie. Document all episodes of
       airsickness on AF Form 4293.
4.3. Visually Induced Motion Sickness (VIMS). If VIMS is so severe that no simulator
training can be accomplished, refer the student to the FS for evaluation of alternatives. Because
VIMS is usually unrelated to airsickness, do not consider students for elimination based solely
on VIMS episodes.
4.4. Manifestation of Apprehension (MOA). Instructors will document the student’s training
record when a student experiences MOA. Refer to AETCI 362205, Volume 1, for guidance
concerning MOA issues.

                                    STUDENT TRAINING

5.1. Flight Leadership Responsibilities.
   5.1.1. Flight Commander. The FLT/CC is the first echelon of command responsible for
   safely and efficiently scheduling people, mission and aircraft for SUPT-H and RWF. The
   FLT/CC must know the capabilities and experience levels of all flight members and ensure
   they fly the right mission at the right time according to applicable syllabuses and directives.
   Safety must remain paramount in the FLT/CC’s mind. FLT/CCs will keep the operations
   supervisors informed of the training plan and any changes and will:
       5.1.1.1. Supervise and monitor student training.
       5.1.1.2. Assist students and supervisors with the training review process and provide for
       discipline, physical and mental well-being, and general welfare of students. The FLT/CC
       must be aware of each student’s progress in all areas, including the potential effect of
       external factors (personal problems, etc.). FLT/CCs help students when they:
          5.1.1.2.1. Counsel students determined to be marginal performers or those placed on
          CAP and conduct follow-up counseling as often thereafter as necessary.
          5.1.1.2.2. Counsel students, as necessary, on appropriate management issues,
          including personal problems and disciplinary matters. If additional assistance is
          necessary, refer students to the appropriate base support agencies (Chaplain, Legal
          Office, etc.).
       5.1.1.3. Maintain student training folders according to Chapter 2 of this instruction,
       local guidance, and the applicable syllabus.
       5.1.1.4. Ensure student compliance and documentation of PT accomplishments.
       5.1.1.5. Coordinate with academic supervisors on individual student performance.
       5.1.1.6. Ensure students are briefed on assignment opportunities as applicable.
       5.1.1.7. Brief student leaders on the scope and limits of their responsibilities.
       5.1.1.8. Assist in syllabus-directed functions.
   5.1.2. Flight Chief. The Flight Chief is the first echelon of command responsible for safely
   and efficiently scheduling people, mission and aircraft for CEARF. The Flight Chief must
   know the capabilities and experience levels of all flight members and ensure they fly the
   right mission at the right time according to applicable syllabuses and directives. Safety must
   remain paramount in the Flight Chief’s mind. Flight Chiefs will keep the operations
   supervisors informed of the training plan and any changes and will:
       5.1.2.1. Supervise and monitor student training.
       5.1.2.2. Assist students and supervisors with the training review process and provide for
       discipline, physical and mental well-being, and general welfare of students. The Flight
       Chief must be aware of each student’s progress in all areas, including the potential effect
       of external factors (personal problems, etc.). Flight Chiefs help students when they:
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                 29


           5.1.2.2.1. Counsel students determined to be marginal performers or those placed on
           CAP and conduct follow-up counseling as often thereafter as necessary.
           5.1.2.2.2. Counsel students, as necessary, on appropriate management issues,
           including personal problems and disciplinary matters. If additional assistance is
           necessary, refer students to the appropriate base support agencies (Chaplain, Legal
           Office, etc.).
       5.1.2.3. Maintain student training folders according to Chapter 2 of this instruction,
       local guidance, and the applicable syllabus.
       5.1.2.4. Ensure student compliance and documentation of PT accomplishments.
       5.1.2.5. Coordinate with academic supervisors on individual student performance.
       5.1.2.6. Ensure students are briefed on assignment opportunities as applicable.
       5.1.2.7. Brief student leaders on the scope and limits of their responsibilities.
       5.1.2.8. Assist in syllabus-directed functions.
5.2. Syllabus Resource Management. The SQ/CC, FLT/CC and Flight Chief are responsible
for the management of student flight hours. Each syllabus unit has an associated number of
sorties or missions and flight hours. On average, the syllabus mission and any AT, PC, or EC
sorties should reflect the average mission duration (AMD) for the unit of training. IPs should
closely adhere to the syllabus AMD. The AMD should not be exceeded except for extenuating
circumstances or to meet training objectives.
5.3. Additional Training Sorties. AT sorties provide extra training to students in specific
circumstances, to include category check failure, break-in-training, CR reinstatement, syllabus
waiver, OG/CC corrective actions, or as otherwise specifically authorized by the syllabus. Refer
to the applicable syllabus for authorized AT sorties and specific guidelines.
   5.3.1. Adaptation to Corrective Lenses (Coded XXX84). These sorties are authorized for
   students who experience training difficulties and require corrective lenses. Normally, these
   sorties are flown in the current unit; however, they may be flown in a different category if
   required. The next aircraft syllabus sortie flown after these sorties must be dual.
   5.3.2. Reallocation (Coded XXX85). A syllabus may authorize sorties designated for one
   unit to be flown in another unit. The reallocated sortie is designated as an “XXX85” in the
   appropriate category. Sorties will be flown prior to the appropriate end-of-unit lesson.
   5.3.3. Warm-up/Break-in-Training (Coded XXX86). These sorties are authorized for
   delays in training and will be flown only when remaining syllabus sorties are insufficient to
   compensate for the student’s break in training. Instructors should consider using the
   simulator instead of the aircraft if appropriate for the student’s category.
   5.3.4. Reinstatement by CR (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized for
   students reinstated into training after a CR.
   5.3.5. Total Sortie/Flying Time (Coded XXX87). Students will fly these sorties to meet
   minimum syllabus sorties or flying time requirements. These sorties are normally full
   mission profile and are authorized when it becomes apparent they are needed. When
   possible, schedule them prior to checks to enhance student proficiency.
 30                                                      AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


   5.3.6. Prior to PC and EC (Coded XXX87). These sorties may be authorized before a PC
   and EC. These sorties are not automatically given to every student. They are reserved for
   cases where the SQ/CC determines some training irregularity or anomaly has occurred, and
   the student has demonstrated the potential to complete the syllabus. Document the training
   irregularity or anomaly as part of the AF Form 4293 AT authorization entry.
   5.3.7. Q-2/Q-3 Flight Evaluation (Coded XXX87). The flight evaluator may authorize
   these sorties as a result of a Q-2/Q-3 flight evaluation.
5.4. Formal Flight Briefings: 23 FTS will conduct mass aircrew briefings prior to each SUPT-
H/CEARF flying period. The mass aircrew briefing will integrate:
   5.4.1. Flying Safety Briefings. Conduct Flight Safety briefings at least once a normal
   workweek. Briefings should emphasize aircraft mishap prevention and promote group
   discussion to improve student judgment and confidence.
   5.4.2. Standardization Briefings. Conduct Standardization Briefings at least three times
   during a normal workweek.            SUPT-H and CEARF training flights will conduct
   standardization briefings. The standardization briefings may be in conjunction with formal
   flight briefing or at a time that ensures maximum IP and student participation. Emphasize
   situational EPs to include overhead questioning and group discussions of selected topics.
   Briefings should be structured to assist in the development of judgment, proper application of
   procedures, and realistic use of available publications. The standardization briefing should
   include a standup EP situation.
   5.4.3. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Briefings. Conduct CRM briefings at least
   once every other week. AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
   Program, and its AETC Supplement outline requirements for the CRM training program.
   CRM briefings will address human-factor causes in aircraft mishaps. Use real-world
   mishaps as examples in the briefings. Brief and debrief CRM core concepts and skills on
   every aircraft and simulator mission. CRM briefings may be substituted for safety or
   standardization briefings, but they are not testable.
5.5. Mission Briefings. These briefings set the tone of the lesson. Cover specific objectives,
mission accomplishment, and specific flight or simulator restrictions. Discuss techniques and
procedures for flying the mission before or after the mission briefing. An instructor will brief
undergraduate student pilots prior to all Team Solo flights. IPs having continuity with the
student should accomplish this briefing. Post-mission briefings measure the success in
accomplishing the mission objectives. Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-series publication for
briefing formats. The applicable syllabus contains mission briefing requirements.
5.6. Student Pilot Standardization Program. The student pilot standardization program
consists of briefings and tests to ensure students maintain the highest proficiency level in
procedural knowledge and application. For SUPT-H, 23 FTS will administer a weekly Flight
Line Quiz (FLQ) covering general and EP knowledge appropriate for the student’s stage of
training. Refer to the applicable syllabus for additional guidance.
   5.6.1. The FLQ may be administered in printed or electronic format. Printed FLQs will be
   numbered sequentially for accounting purposes. Immediately prior to administering the
   FLQ, the testing administrator will:
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                   31


       5.6.1.1. Generate a fresh 20-question FLQ from the GTIMS SUPT-H secure server with
       a representative number of questions from each assigned reading area.
       5.6.1.2. Secure the room and administer the FLQ.
       5.6.1.3. Collect any printed FLQs and answer sheets and account for each numbered
       copy.
       5.6.1.4. Grade the FLQ; record the scores; and destroy all test copies, answer sheets, the
       answer key, transparencies, and (or) electronic versions.
   5.6.2. The minimum passing score on all flight line tests is 85 percent and 100 percent for
   Boldface tests.
5.7. Incomplete Sorties:
   5.7.1. Except for category checks, PCs, and ECs, the FLT/CC or Flight Chief will determine
   if a sortie is incomplete. He or she will:
       5.7.1.1. Evaluate each situation on an individual basis. (NOTE: If a student has had
       ample opportunity to learn a task and subsequently flies a short sortie, do not incomplete
       the sortie. Also do not incomplete a lesson solely because an individual maneuver is
       omitted when the omitted maneuver can be accomplished on a later sortie without
       degrading accomplishment of future training objectives.)
       5.7.1.2. Consider the sortie’s effect on the quality of the student’s training and each
       student’s prior training opportunities as well as the remaining sorties available to
       accomplish training objectives. The syllabus provides a means of AT for students who
       do not progress to the end of unit MIF proficiency requirements.
       5.7.1.3. Ensure both above- and below-average students are afforded the same training
       opportunities to refine their skills.
       5.7.1.4. Normally do not incomplete a Team Solo sortie.
   5.7.2. Incomplete sorties do not break a string of unsatisfactory syllabus sorties.
5.8. Grading Procedures. Instructors will grade student training according to the applicable
syllabus. The CTS is the baseline for all maneuver grading. Instructors must compare student
performance to the CTS before assigning maneuver grades.
5.9. Category Checks. Category checks validate students have achieved the required
proficiency and (or) instructional level for a category, are conducted according to the applicable
syllabus, and are graded against the CTS using the required MIF proficiency and instructional
levels as the baseline.
   5.9.1. Profile. The SQ/CC will ensure a cross-section of maneuvers optioned in the
   category check MIF are sampled regularly on category checks.
   5.9.2. Grading. Checks are syllabus events and the CTS must be applied exactly as on daily
   events. The starting point for assigning any maneuver grade is the CTS which equates to
   satisfactory proficiency level or a letter grade of G. The instructor will grade student
   maneuvers according to the applicable syllabus, grading completed checks excellent (E),
   good (G), U or NG (no grade) overall.
 32                                                       AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


   5.9.3. Incomplete Checks. With SQ/CC approval, checks may be considered incomplete if
   no maneuver completed by the student was graded below MIF and either all required
   maneuvers were not flown or the number of maneuvers flown was insufficient to reasonably
   assess the student’s overall performance. If a check is incomplete, the student need only
   perform those maneuvers necessary to complete a normal check profile on the subsequent
   (refly) check.
   5.9.4. Failed Areas. If a student fails a category check in an area directly related to another
   category, the subsequent PC or EC may be flown in the related category.
5.10. Check Flight CT Meetings. The SQ/CC will conduct squadron Check Flight CT
meetings at least quarterly to ensure grading philosophy, practices and standards are consistent
and standardized. All individuals who conduct category checks are required to attend. As a
minimum, each meeting should include a review of pass and fail rates by category for each check
administered since the last CT meeting, category check weak areas or trends, pass and fail rates
of individual check pilots, and at least one grading scenario brought to a conclusion. Document
the meetings in enough detail so that those who have an authorized absence can read the meeting
minutes and understand what transpired.
5.11. Flight Evaluations. Conduct flight evaluations according to AFI 11-202, Volume
2/AETC Supplement, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and the applicable syllabus.
5.12. Wash Back. When a student washes back into another class, the SQ/CC is the approving
authority for determining the appropriate GTIMS version of the syllabus to use to continue the
student’s training.
5.13. Civilian Flight Training. Due to the differences in rotary wing and fixed wing flying,
SUPT-H students are prohibited from conducting civilian flying while enrolled in formal
training.
5.14. Flight Planning Software use in SUPT-H. Flight instruction of flight planning principles
in SUPT-H is focused on the understanding of the key concepts involved in flight planning and
application those concepts through the use of flight planning software. Reinforce the flight
planning skills and conceptual understanding learned in primary with emphasis on differences
associated with helicopter operations. Students are required to plan and fly applicable sorties
using software-based flight planning methods according to syllabus requirements.
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                  33

                           STUDENT ASSIGNMENT PROCESS

6.1. Overview: Enlisted and Officer Assignment processes are different. CEA and Officer
Assignment processes are outlined below:
6.2. CEARF Students.
   6.2.1. CEARF students receive MWS assignment based on current AFPC Career Enlisted
   Aviator assignment procedure IAW AFI 36-2110.
6.2.2. Students should receive MWS/Duty station assignments prior to arrival at 23
FTS. If student does not have an assignment upon arrival, contact AFPC/DPALT5 for
assignment information.
6.3. SUPT-H Students
6.3.1. Students receive track and MWS assignments based on demonstrated potential to
successfully complete required follow-on training. MWS assignments consider three
elements:
       6.3.1.1. Needs of the Air Force.
       6.3.1.2. MWS availability.
       6.3.1.3. Student desires.
   6.3.2. To aid commanders in these decisions, the Merit Assignment Selection System
   (MASS), a command-directed performance measurement tool, is provided. MASS provides
   student pilot relative ranking within his or her class and is used for student MWS assignment,
   and final graduation order of merit.
   6.3.3. The 58 SOW/CC is the approval authority for all MWS assignment decisions. Any
   waivers or deviations from this process must originate from the 58 SOW/CC for review by
   AETC/A3F.
6.4. Career Information. Before MWS assignment, the SQ/CC or designated representative
will provide students with MWS-specific career information. This information should help
students make informed choices when requesting specific aircraft. Information should include
mission duties, career path and advancement opportunities, and average TDY commitments.
6.5. Merit Assignment Selection System for SUPT-H Students:
   6.5.1. FLT/CC or appropriate squadron representative will present a comprehensive briefing
   to each class to ensure understanding of the MASS methodology. The FLT/CC or other
   appropriate squadron representative must ensure he or she subsequently briefs any student
   who is unavoidably absent.
   6.5.2. MASS generates a merit ranking which is an overall assessment of the student’s
   airmanship and capability based upon demonstrated performance. It includes the FLT/CC’s
   assessment of the student’s flying skills, leadership, teamwork, officership, attitude, and
   potential to complete follow-on training.
 34                                                      AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


   6.5.3. A GTIMS MASS transaction is required for each SUPT-H class after the advanced
   (MWS assignment) phase. Run a finalized MASS to determine class merit order for each
   SUPT the primary phase. The training unit must finalize the MASS prior to class phase
   graduation and after any and all intermediate MASS calculations are complete. OG/CC
   ensures a finalized MASS is performed in GTIMS.
6.6. Computing MASS Standardized Scores. Use the following statistical methodology to
compute MASS standardized scores.
   6.6.1. Mean ():

Figure 6.1. Formula for computing Mean




NOTE: N is the number of students in the class, and Xi is the individual’s score (academic
examination average, daily maneuver score, check score, etc.).
   6.6.2. Standard deviation ():

Figure 6.2. Formula for computing Standard deviation




NOTE: N and Xi are defined in paragraph 6.6.1 and x is the mean score for the category
(academic examination average mean, daily maneuver score mean, check evaluation score
mean).
   6.6.3. Number of standard deviations from the mean (z-score):

Figure 6.3. Formula for computing z-score




   6.6.4. T-score: T = 50 + 10 (z-score). Tscores are weighted according to these calculations.
   Add the weighted T-scores to compute the total merit score.
   6.6.5. Compute maneuver (M) scores for daily flying and check performance based on the
   following formula:
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                  35


Figure 6.4. Formula for computing M Score




NOTE: Each maneuver has scores for unable, fair, good, and excellent. Critical maneuvers are
weighted more heavily. Weighted grade values for individual maneuvers are available in the
maneuver grade files. For an incomplete sortie or a PC/EC sortie following a failed category
check, the maneuver score is based on the first graded attempt of the maneuver.
6.7. SUPT-H Merit Ranking. Use only advanced phase data to determine assignment selection
rank, as appropriate. Use this MASS table to determine TH-1H final merit ranking:

Table 6.1. FLT/CC Ranking T-Score

NOTE: The cutoff for TH-1H daily maneuver scores is completion of the Night Vision Goggles
(NVG) Remote Procedures unit and before assignment day (or night).
6.8. Example Calculation. This example calculates the TH-1H total score for SUPT-H.
   6.8.1. Category Check Maneuver Scores. Compute using percentage score, multiply by
   weighting factor, and total. Use this total to compute a T-score for category check
   maneuvers.

Table 6.2. Sample Category Check Points
 Contact            215 pts received/235 pts possible = .91489 × 100 = 91.489 × .16 = 14.638
 Instrument         232 pts received/235 pts possible = .98723 × 100 = 98.723 × .28 = 27.642
 Day Tactical         228 pts received/235 pts possible = .97021 × 100 = 97.021 × .28 = 27.166
 NVG Remote
                      339 pts received/365 pts possible = 92876 × 100 = 92.876 × .28 = 26.005

NOTE: Assuming the mean for this class’s category checks is 93.422 with a standard deviation
of 3.270, then this student’s 95.451 total category check points yield a z-score of +0.6208,
resulting in a category check maneuver T-score of 56.208.

 Daily Maneuver T-Score                                                               = 43.217
NOTE: Assuming the mean for this class’s daily maneuvers is 71.237 and a standard deviation
of 5.941, then this student’s 67.206 total points yield a z-score of –0.6783 resulting in a daily
maneuver T-score of 43.217.
   6.8.3. Academic Scores. Students’ academic test averages are used to compute their z-
   scores. Only the first test attempt counts in the student’s academic test average. Instructors
   will ensure all retakes of failed academic tests are entered as retakes.

Table 6.5. Sample Academic Check T-Score
 Academic Test Average         = 96.891
 Class Mean                    = 96.060
 Standard Deviation            = 1.886
 z-Score                       = 0.4883
 Academic Check T-Score = 54.883
NOTE: In this example, the student’s academic test average is 96.891. Assuming the class
average is 96.060 with a standard deviation of 1.886, then the resulting z-score is +0.4883
yielding an academic T-score of 54.883.
   6.8.4. FLT/CC Ranking. Each FLT/CC will rank assigned students using the Flight
   Commander          Ranking         Matrix         at          https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13492A0FB5E044080020E329A9.
   Use the FLT/CC ranking scores to compute a z-score. In this example, we use a ranking of 5
   out of 15 = 95.71.
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                     37


Table 6.6. Sample FLT/CC Ranking T-Score
 FLT/CC Ranking (5th of 15)      = 95.710
 Class Mean                      = 92.500
 Standard Deviation              = 4.652
 z-Score                         = 0.690
  FLT/CC Ranking T-Score = 56.90
NOTE: By design, the mean for all classes’ FLT/CC ranking is 92.50. However the standard
deviation varies depending on class size. In this case, we use a standard deviation of 4.652; then
this student’s 95.710 yields a z-score of +0.690, resulting in a FLT/CC ranking T-score of
56.900.
6.9. SUPT-H Assignment Selection Process:
   6.9.1. Students receive MWS assignments based on their potential to successfully complete
   required follow-on training. Upon completion of the NVG Remote Procedures unit and
   before assignment day (or night), 23 FTS/CC will compute student merit order. Contact
   AETC/A3F for MASS calculation questions. NOTE: AFPC/DPALT will provide a full
   assignment block to 58 OG/CC for student review three weeks before graduation.
   6.9.2. After receiving the aircraft assignment block and before assignment day (or night),
   students will complete an AF Form 3849, PME/AFIT/RTFB/Officer Worksheet, or local
   OG/CC-approved form. indicating their choice (in order) of MWS aircraft. The FLT/CC will
   make a first assignment instructor pilot (FAIP) recommendation for each student on the AF
   Form 3849. Base the recommendation on the student’s demonstrated flying and
   interpersonal skills, maturity, and potential to return as an FAIP.
   6.9.3. The 23 FTS/CC and assigned FLT/CCs will convene to assign MWS aircraft, using
   the following procedures:
       6.9.3.1. Rank students in merit order for MWS aircraft.
       6.9.3.2. If available, the top 10 percent of graduates should receive their first choice. For
       example, in a class of 15 students, the top 10 percent would be 1.5 students. Round
       numbers .5 and above to the next higher number, making the top 10 percent (in this
       example) two students.
       6.9.3.3. Do not assign FAIP duty unless the student specifically volunteers.
       6.9.3.4. Use the rank order listing and the student’s AF Form 3849 to provide the best
       match of the student’s desires with available MWS aircraft.
       6.9.3.5. When a quota for an FAIP is unfilled and the remaining students are not
       recommended for FAIP duty, 23 FTS/CC will contact AFPC/DPALT for further
       assignment guidance.
       6.9.3.6. For rated management reasons, do not assign FAIP duty to captains (as of
       graduation), even if they volunteer.
38                                                     AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014


     6.9.3.7. After all assignments are made; 23 FTS/CC will submit the results to the 58
     OG/CC for final approval who, in turn, will forward copies of the final class merit order
     and MWS assign ents to AFPC/DPALT within two duty days after final approval.
  6.9.4. Post Assignment Selection. Squadron supervisors will establish procedures to
  announce track and assignment drops for both pilots and CEAs. In addition, they will closely
  monitor student performance after MWS assignment. When appropriate, squadron,
  operations group, and wing personnel will work with AETC/A1KO, AFPC/DPALT or
  AFPC/DPAOM4 (as appropriate for Officer or CEA) to coordinate any assignment changes
  necessitated by post-MWS assignment performance.

                                    STUDENT AWARDS

Section 7A—S

7.1. Overview. The 58 SOW/CC will establish and maintain a program to present awards to
students selected as outstanding in academics, military qualities, and flying training. Duplicate
awards may be presented for ties. AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards, governs
appropriations for such awards. The 23 FTS/CC will select nominees for student awards
approved by the WG/CC. MASS data for all awards will only be from the advanced phase of
training (SUPT-H).
7.2. Distinguished Graduate (DG) Awards. OG/CC may select DGs from the students in each
class and present them a plaque during graduation. For each class, the OG/CC is the final
approving authority for all awards. DG award requires a student to be in the upper 10 percent of
the graduating class. (Round numbers .5 and above to the next higher number.) Any academic
event failure disqualifies students for this award. Unsatisfactory performance on more than one
flying training event in each category disqualifies students for this award. Unsatisfactory
performance on more than three flying training events disqualifies students for this award. If a
DG is an ANG or AFRC member, notify AETC/A3G or AETC/A3H, as appropriate, as soon as
possible to ensure appropriate representation.
7.3. Order of Daedalians AETC Commander’s Trophy. This award is presented to the
student in each class with the highest MASS score. The OG/CC is the approving authority for
these awards. The 23FTS/CC notifies the Order of Daedalians of the recipient’s name before
class graduation and presentation. The WG/CC (or designated representative) presents the
trophies during the graduation ceremony. The trophy is a 7-inch tall, cast bronze statue of an
eagle with outstretched wings and talons, mounted on a 1 1/2-inch tall circular bronze base.
Attach a suitable brass plate to the base and engrave as follows:

                                        (Class and Base)

7.4. Academic and Flying Training Awards. The academic training award is presented to the
student in each track with the highest academic MASS score. In the event of a tie the student
with the highest FLQ average is selected. Any academic event failure disqualifies students for
this award. The flying training award is presented to the student with the highest combined daily
sortie and category check sortie MASS scores. Unsatisfactory performance on more than one
flight in each category disqualifies students for this award. The OG/CC is the approving
authority for these awards.
AETCI36-2205V10 4 MARCH 2014                                                                    41


7.5. Orville Wright Achievement Award:
   7.5.1. This Daedalian Foundation award is given to the most outstanding SUPT or ENJJPT
   graduate of the quarter and consists of an engraved plaque and a citation presented by a
   member of the Order of Daedalians. Students of any military branch are eligible for this
   award, presented quarterly.
   7.5.2. Each UPT base will nominate one student per quarter. Send the nomination
   memorandum to AETC/A3FP within 10 duty days after the end of the quarter when the
   nominee graduated.        Include a biographical sketch of the nominee and training
   accomplishments in the memorandum. Attach a copy of the nominee’s AETC Form 240-5
   and official orders or forwarding address to the memorandum.
   7.5.3. An award board at AETC/A3F will select the award recipient. AETC/A3F will
   inform the units, the gaining squadron commander, and the Order of Daedalians of the
   graduate selected for the award. The Order of Daedalians will forward the award to the
   appropriate base for presentation.

Section 7B—CEARF

7.6. Distinguished Graduate (DG) Awards. OG/CC may select DGs from the students in each
class. For each class, the OG/CC is the final approving authority for all awards. As a minimum,
a DG award requires a student to be in the upper 10 percent of the graduating class. Classes with
fewer than 10 students may have one DG. Fractions may be rounded up. Commanders may
elect not to designate a DG in a class. If a DG is an ANG or AFRC member, notify AETC/A3G
or AETC/A3H, as appropriate, as soon as possible. Students in the grade of E8 and E9 are
ineligible for the DG program.
