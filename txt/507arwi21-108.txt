This instruction establishes procedures, assigns responsibilities, and outlines actions pertaining to
the Functional Check Flight/Operational Check Flight (FCF/OCF) program and high speed taxi
procedures. It is used in conjunction with AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-101/AFRC Sup 1, Aerospace
Equipment Maintenance Management; Technical Order (T.O.) 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional
Check Flight and Maintenance Operational Checks; and AFI 11-2KC-135V3, C/KC-135

scheduling, supporting, or conducting Functional/Operational Check Flights. It applies to all 137
MXG and 137 OG personnel who maintain or operate ARC-Associated aircraft, systems, and
equipment during periods of duty at (or off station from) Tinker AFB. References to an
organization, group, or squadron, (i.e. OG, MXG, AMXS…) refer to both the 507 ARW and 137
ARW as appropriate. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a new publication and must be thoroughly reviewed. It contains language that has been
removed from Chapter 8 of AFI 21-101 AFRC Supplement 1 507ARW Supplement 1.
 2                                                      507ARWI21-108 5 SEPTEMBER 2013


1. General
     1.1. Functional Check Flights (FCF) / Operational Check Flights (OCF) are performed when
     required by T.O. 1C-135-6, Aircraft Scheduled Inspection and Maintenance Requirements,
     Section II, Part C. They may be conducted after maintenance actions when required by Time
     Compliance Technical Order (TCTO), when deemed appropriate by the Maintenance Group
     Commander (MXG/CC), or when airworthiness cannot be determined by ground
     maintenance checks.
     1.2. Functional Check Flights are rarely performed by KC-135 field units; Operational
     Check Flights are more common. For the purposes of this instruction, OCF will be used for
     brevity and will be construed to mean FCF when appropriate.
     1.3. The MXG/CC and OG/CC jointly share responsibilities for managing the OCF program.
     OG Standardization and Evaluation (OG/OGV) and Maintenance Quality Assurance
     (MXG/MXQ) will be the Offices of Primary Responsibility for their respective groups.
     Active participation from all involved will be necessary to ensure effective management of
     the OCF program.
     1.4. OGV will determine if training may be conducted or scheduled mission continued upon
     successful completion of the OCF sortie requirement. The configuration (as required), fuel
     load, and sortie profile will be determined NLT the day prior and annotated in the Remarks
     section of the schedule.
     1.5. When requested by the MXG and approved by the OG/CC (or designated
     representative), maintenance technicians may fly with the airplane as Mission Essential
     Personnel (MEP). MXG will provide information to the appropriate Squadron Aviation
     Resource Management (SARM) office IAW AFI 11-401. MEP will wear a military uniform
     and meet AFI 36-2903, Dress and Appearance of Air Force Personnel, standards prior to the
     flight. Technicians from the Hydraulic Shop (MXS or AMXS) should be scheduled any time
     an OCF involves the Air Refueling Boom.
2. OCF Scheduling Procedure
     2.1. The performing MXS or AMXS workcenter will notify the Quality Assurance (QA)
     office when the need for an OCF arises. Provide the tail number and the reason for the OCF.
     2.2. The QA OCF Manager (or alternate) will validate the condition requiring the OCF and
     will contact Operations Scheduling to request scheduling of the OCF. This request will be
     made via E-Mail no earlier than 48 hours prior to the intended flight. The request will be
     used to coordinate the following offices:
        2.2.1. OG and ARS Commanders, (or designated representative)
        2.2.2. Standardization/Evaluation (OGV) (Pilot and Boom),
        2.2.3. Pilot Scheduling (DOP),
        2.2.4. Chief, Air Refueling Operations (DOB),
        2.2.5. Mission Development / Current Operations (OSO),
        2.2.6. Maintenance Plans and Scheduling (MXOOS),
        2.2.7. Maintenance Production Superintendent (MXA),
507ARWI21-108 5 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 3


       2.2.8. Other offices as the situation dictates.
   2.3. After all parties have been coordinated; Operations Scheduling will add a line to GDSS2
   showing the OCF and issue an AF Form 2407, Flying Schedule Coordination, using the
   507ARW.2407@tinker.af.mil functional address.
   2.4. Maintenance Plans, Scheduling & Documentation (PS&D) will then enter the affected
   tail number into the line in GDSS2.
3. Maintenance Quality Assurance – The QA OCF Manager will:
   3.1. Review all aircraft maintenance documents for accuracy and enter the OCF discrepancy
   into the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Example
   verbiage for the entry could be, “OCF Required Due To [maintenance action]”.
   3.2. Make an entry in G081 and provide the Production Superintendent or Expeditor with the
   Job Control Number (JCN).
   3.3. Develop an OCF checklist appropriate to the system/component being checked. Use the
   checklist to conduct the aircrew OCF briefing, outlining all the requirements and procedures
   to be performed.
   3.4. Review the weight & balance documents to ensure all required entries are completed,
   and that the computed basic weight and moment from the AF Form 4100 matches that shown
   on the Chart C. Ensure the airplane configuration matches that represented by the AF 4100.
   OCFs are normally flown with a Training configuration; however, if the airplane is loaded
   per a different loadplan, do not reconfigure solely for the purpose of the OCF.
   3.5. Be present during the aircrew post-flight debriefing and gather all needed information to
   report on the flight. Enter this information into the QANTTAS OCF Module in lieu of an AF
   Form 2400, Functional Check Flight Log.
   3.6. Clear G081 entry, if the aircraft has been released.
   3.7. Route completed, signed OCF checklist to PS&D for inclusion in the aircraft’s jacket
   file.
4. Performing Work Center – The shop requesting the OCF will:
   4.1. Ensure all operational checks and follow-on maintenance required by technical data has
   been completed prior to flight.
   4.2. Have a representative present during the aircrew OCF briefing, and at the post-flight
   debriefing. Personnel flying as MEP should be the ones attending the briefings.
5. Aircraft Maintenance Squadron – Maintainers will:
   5.1. Ensure the required inspection per T.O. 1C-135-6WC-1 is completed and
   service/configure the airplane as required.
   5.2. Review the aircraft forms and ensure no open discrepancies exist affecting the
   airworthiness of the aircraft and system requiring the OCF. Bring the forms binder to the
   OCF aircrew briefing.
6. OCF Sortie Procedures – Aircraft Commanders will:
6.1. Ensure the OCF is planned for suitable airspace providing adequate altitude blocks and

maneuvering room. (Ref: AFI 11-2KC-135V3, 507OG and 137OG Supplements respectively
for OCF areas)
     6.2. Ensure all required crewmembers attend the OCF briefing conducted by MXG/QA,
     normally two hours prior to scheduled take off time. This briefing may be held in
     conjunction with the normal preflight aircrew briefing for convenience.
     6.3. After flight:
        6.3.1. Sign off the OCF entry in the aircraft forms IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Verbiage will
        indicate if the airplane is Released, Conditional Released, or Not Released for further
        flight.
        6.3.2. Create additional entries if needed to document defects from the flight.
        6.3.3. Complete all applicable portions of the OCF checklist as required. Return the
        completed OCF checklist to MXG/QA during debrief.
        6.3.4. The entire OCF aircrew will attend the MXG/QA flight debriefing. Required
        systems specialists should also be in attendance.
7. Releases
     7.1. OCF releases will be IAW AFI 21-101, paragraph 8.16.6.
8. High Speed Taxi
     8.1. High speed taxi checks will not be performed. When any checkout is requested, the
     maintenance actions will be reviewed to determine whether an OCF is necessary to provide
     validation of functionality, or if an inflight operational check of the affected system may be
     completed during the next scheduled sortie. Appropriate Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) guidelines will be followed.
