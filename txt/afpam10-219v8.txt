  MILITARY OPERATIONS AND PRIME BASE ENGINEER EMERGENCY FORCE
                             (BEEF)

1.1. Civil Engineer (CE) Hierarchy of Publications. This Pamphlet supports implementation
of Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness. It builds upon lessons learned, doctrinal
precepts outlined in Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 4-0, Combat Support and AFDD 3-
34, Engineer Operations, and current Air Force (AF) policy. This relationship is illustrated in the
AF CE hierarchy of publications (Figure 1.1). This Pamphlet contains practical information to
help units prepare Prime BEEF teams for deployment.

Figure 1.1. CE Hierarchy of Publications

1.2. Introduction. When called upon to protect vital national interests, the AF must be able to
quickly send combat and support forces to crisis locations anywhere in the world to deter war
and, should deterrence fail, fight and win. CE support is a vital element in the AF’s ability to
maintain global presence and project global power. AF civil engineers must be able to deploy
units to provide immediate beddown, fire emergency services (FES), explosive ordnance
disposal (EOD) support, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) response, and
emergency management (EM) functions. Engineers must be capable of rapid and effective base
recovery in support of sustained operations. Prime BEEF teams, along with in-place CE forces
and RED HORSE squadrons, ensure civil engineers meet this challenge. This volume focuses on
the Prime BEEF mission.
1.3. Engineer Combat Support. Combat support not just CE support is an essential component
of the AF’s deterrence and warfighting capability. Combat air operations and strategic airlift
depend on bases with adequate facilities and resources to launch and recover mission aircraft and
support high sortie generation rates. Prime BEEF teams, in-place CE forces, and RED HORSE
squadrons prepare bases for wartime operations and recover them from war damage. Although
all three elements are essential to the overall effort, Prime BEEF teams are considered the
backbone of CE combat support because they provide an organic engineer capability for
deploying combat support forces and comprise the bulk of all CE forces.
     1.3.1. In-place CE forces that support military operations are said to have a generation
     mission while forces that deploy are considered to have a mobility mission. Prime BEEF
     teams deploy with combat support forces to collocated operating bases (COBs), stand-by
     bases, bare bases, en route bases, and main operating bases (MOBs). In-place civil engineers
     at overseas locations “generate” the support required at their base, but rarely are there
     sufficient in-place forces to meet total mission requirements. Consequently, Prime BEEF
     teams may also deploy to augment in-place forces.
     1.3.2. The Prime BEEF concept provides for a dual use of military civil engineers. In
     garrison, personnel perform real property operations and maintenance (O&M), FES, EOD,
     and EM missions. In war, those same personnel can deploy as teams to provide CE combat
     support wherever required.
     1.3.3. Prime BEEF was established to support combat/warfighting scenarios, but teams can
     and do respond to peacetime taskings such as major accidents, natural disaster relief and
     recovery operations, peacetime engineering projects, support to civil authorities, and military
     training exercises. Support may range from many teams to a few individuals.
     1.3.4. The Prime BEEF program ensures engineer forces are organized, trained, and
     equipped to perform any of those roles. Teams must be able to deploy with little advance
     warning and perform CE contingency and wartime tasks at any type of base and in all
     weather conditions. The Air Reserve Components (ARC) the AF Reserves and the Air
     National Guard (ANG) posture Prime BEEF teams to round out the Total CE Force.
1.4. Military Operations Planning. Good operations planning enables the AF jointly with its
sister services to respond rapidly and effectively to anticipated threats or unforeseen crises.
Because many of the concepts and terms used in this volume are tied to joint operations
planning, this short overview of military operations planning is included to help clarify the
process unfamiliar to many personnel. For more details, see AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations
Planning and Execution.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                7


  1.4.1. Contingency Versus Crisis Action Planning. Operation planning is usually done
  deliberately during peacetime to prepare for likely threats; however, operation planning is
  done in the crisis action mode when an unanticipated crisis arises with little or no warning.
  The big difference between contingency and crisis action planning is the amount of time
  available. In the crisis action mode, the situation will dictate whether commanders and
  planners can modify a contingency plan or must create a “no plan” response.
  1.4.2. Operation Plans (OPLAN). In either case, operation planning is a process to determine
  how to respond to a likely threat or actual crisis and what forces are needed. The result is
  documented in an OPLAN or, if time is very short, in the operations order (OPORD). An
  OPLAN or OPORD identifies which combat and support units will be used to respond to the
  threat or crisis. It shows where, when, and how those forces will be deployed, employed, and
  supported. An OPLAN also outlines the command structure and provides functional area
  direction.
  1.4.3. Basic and Supporting Plans. Combatant commanders (CCDR) are responsible for
  preparing the controlling OPLAN and each component commander builds a supporting plan.
  The OPLAN identifies essential support needed from commands not under the joint
  commander’s control. Supporting commands, such as the Air Mobility Command (AMC),
  are required to prepare supporting plans to ensure they provide needed personnel and
  equipment on time. Two key functions of joint planning are to ensure all of the plans
  collectively satisfy the CCDR’s needs and to resolve any conflicting requirements between
  the plans, especially transportation requirements.
  1.4.4. Installation Support Plans. Theater bases and units get involved in OPLANs by
  creating installation support plans (or joint support plans for host nation bases) to ensure each
  base can support its OPLAN taskings and can properly receive, beddown, and support
  arriving or transiting forces. Continental United States (CONUS) and overseas bases which
  provide deploying forces create deployment plans to ensure their forces are prepared to load
  and move by the time aircraft or surface transport arrive on station.
  1.4.5. Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD). To complete an OPLAN,
  planners create a master database of all tasked combat and support units both in-place and
  deployed forces. Within this database, they add the transportation requirements to get those
  forces into position. This database is called the TPFDD (pronounced “tip fid”). In common
  terms the TPFDD is an established road map designed to get personnel and equipment from
  point A to point B as effectively as possible. Each OPLAN or OPORD has a unique TPFDD.
     1.4.5.1. The TPFDD is critical. This master force list makes it possible for limited land,
     sea, and air transportation assets to move OPLAN-designated units from their home
     station to the correct destination, in the proper sequence, and on time. The TPFDD also
     contains non-unit requirements such as personnel, equipment, and supplies not assigned
     to a unit, but must flow to the area of operations to sustain OPLAN forces. The TPFDD is
     available to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the joint command, all of its component
     commands, and all supporting commands through the Global Command and Control
     System (GCCS).
     1.4.5.2. When one or more Prime BEEF teams are tasked to support an OPLAN, each
     team will be included in the TPFDD for that OPLAN. Each tasked team is uniquely
 8                                                  AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


        identified in the TPFDD by a unit line number (ULN). The TPFDD, along with the actual
        deployment order, drives the deployment plan and schedule.
     1.4.6. Transportation Feasibility. To complete an OPLAN, the United States (US)
     Transportation Command, consisting of the AF’s AMC, the Army’s Surface Deployment &
     Distribution Command, and the Navy’s Military Sealift Command uses the TPFDD to
     develop transportation plans to support the CCDR’s operations concept. The TPFDD and
     transportation plans are adjusted until the OPLAN can be supported. This process is called
     TPFDD refinement. When the requirements are set, the transportation commands prepare
     movement tables for the OPLAN or movement schedules for actual deployments.
1.5. Computer Systems and Operations Planning. Getting the forces and supplies in position
to fight the war is a big part of operations planning because most forces are based in the
CONUS. Quickly moving an AF wing with its personnel, equipment, and supplies to an overseas
location is a large, complex effort involving many different organizations and commands. The
US military uses computers to help create and store data on OPLAN forces and their
transportation details. The next few paragraphs highlight key parts of the systems and
subsystems that affect civil engineers. For more information on these systems, refer to AFI 10-
401.
     1.5.1. Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES). JOPES is the principal
     system within the Department of Defense (DOD) for translating policy decisions into
     OPLANs and OPORDs in support of national security objectives. It identifies capability
     shortfalls and provides movement requirements to transportation providers. It is used by the
     joint community to conduct joint planning during peace and crisis. The TPFDD is just one of
     its many “products.” JOPES is really a group of computer systems that “talk” to each other
     through the GCCS communications links.
     1.5.2. Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES). DCAPES
     is the AF’s war planning system and provides an AF feed to JOPES. DCAPES provides
     standard data files, formats, application programs, and management procedures that are AF-
     unique and joint guidance compliant and are used primarily for force planning, sourcing
     equipment and personnel requirements, transportation feasibility estimation, CE support, and
     medical planning. DCAPES is the standard automated data processing system designed to
     provide communication of OPLAN requirements and resource monitoring capability by
     integrating planning data with operations, logistics, manpower, and personnel processes to
     enable planners to develop and access near-real-time data from Service and joint systems.
        1.5.2.1. War and Mobilization Plan (WMP). The WMP is an AF system that provides
        Air Staff and AF commanders with current policies, forces, and planning factors for
        conducting and supporting wartime operations. It is an automated planning tool which
        includes an integrated database containing WMP-3, Part 1 (Combat Forces); WMP-3,
        Part 2 (Unit Type Code [UTC] Availability); WMP-3 Part 3 (Readiness Spares Package);
        WMP-3, Part 4 (Air & Space Expeditionary Force [AEF] Presence Policy); WMP-5
        (Rates & Factors); and a TPFDD development tool.
            1.5.2.1.1. Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) Force Modules (FMs). In order to
            facilitate UTC requirements determination, FMs have been developed. FMs are
            combinations of UTCs that provide a generalized mission or capability. In addition to
            linking UTCs, FMs may or may not link specific units.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                             9


         1.5.2.1.2. AETF FMs use a building block approach and consist of generic UTC
         combinations that support an overarching mission. The UTCs that comprise these
         FMs will be equitably aligned across the AEF libraries to facilitate crisis action
         planning while maintaining the AEF.
  1.5.3. Integrated Deployment System (IDS). IDS is the standard AF wing-level deployment
  system. It is an umbrella base system designed to streamline the base-level deployment
  process. It (a) allows one-time data capture and immediate substitution of unit equipment and
  personnel and (b) improves data transfer and accuracy. The IDS consists of the following
  software programs: Logistics Module (LOGMOD), Manpower and Personnel Module
  (MANPER), Cargo Movement Operations Systems (CMOS)/Global Air Transportation
  Execution System (GATES), and the Automated Air Load Planning System (AALPS).
  1.5.4. LOGMOD. LOGMOD at base level is maintained by the Plans & Integration Section
  of the host base Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS). The base LOGMOD system is tied to a
  regional server that has a central database all users share (users have varying levels of
  access). LOGMOD can talk to the Manpower and Personnel Module-Base (MANPER-B) to
  produce installation deployment products. Within LOGMOD, there are four subsystems
  (modules): Logistics Force Packaging System (LOGFOR), Logistics Plan (LOGPLAN),
  Deployment Schedule of Events (DSOE), and Unit Deployment Manager (UDM).
     1.5.4.1. LOGFOR Module. The LOGFOR subsystem provides the standard logistics
     details (LOGDET) for deployable force packages called UTCs. LOGFOR files contain
     the baseline information units must use to posture the equipment and supplies for their
     UTCs. These files tell units what equipment and supplies they need, provides movement
     configuration for those items, and identifies any special requirements for transporting the
     planned cargo. Military planners at major commands (MAJCOMs) and joint commands
     use these files to conduct feasibility planning. These read-only files can be copied to the
     LOGPLAN by the LRS to serve as a starting point when creating unit-unique deployment
     data or when comparing the manpower and equipment force packaging (MEFPAK)
     system data.
     1.5.4.2. LOGPLAN. The LOGPLAN is specifically designed to allow units to adjust
     LOGDET data for the unit. The LOGPLAN gives the capability to enter unit-specific
     data about equipment and supplies and the ability to adjust the file information when
     adding, deleting, or replacing items. One the product is defined as the LOGPLAN
     materiel list. The LOGPLAN shows exactly what equipment and supplies have been
     packed and how to load them. The LOGFOR can also create some of the shipping
     documents that must accompany the cargo. Units must create the LOGPLAN data for
     each OPLAN, exercise, or actual deployment they are tasked to support. This does not
     mean a unit starts all over and generates new data each time. Each unit creates an
     exercise LOGPLAN that reflects its most challenging OPLAN tasking. Keep the exercise
     LOGPLAN current. Then only validate or adjust the data for an actual deployment. Gain
     access to the LOGFOR to generate the LOGPLAN in one of two ways: through the
     Logistics Readiness office or through the intranet connection to LOGMOD using the
     UDM module.
     1.5.4.3. DSOE Module. Base-level logistics planners use the DSOE module to create a
     movement schedule for all personnel and cargo that must be transported during a
10                                               AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


     deployment operation. This module draws on data from the LOGMOD and MANPER-B
     modules to create the DSOE. Units have read-only access to view the DSOE on line, or
     they can receive hard copy printouts of the DSOE from the deployment control center.
     1.5.4.4. UDM Module. The UDM module is a unit’s gateway to MANPER-B and
     LOGMOD. With the software loaded on a personal computer in the unit and a local area
     network connection to the LOGMOD system, deployment managers can update their
     cargo data in LOGPLAN and personnel data in MANPER-B. User identifications (IDs)
     and passwords are used to control access to the system. A unit can view and update only
     the data for its UTCs. The view and the update capabilities are limited to cargo and
     personnel associated with the UDM’s “Unit Org ID” (The Unit Org ID for a hypothetical
     332 CES would be 0332CESSQ0000). The UDM enters training, immunizations, duty
     sections, and deployment checklist data for individuals assigned to the unit. The UDM
     assigns personnel to mobility positions by line numbers and also assigns those personnel
     to “chalks” based on the number of seats allocated to the unit during the DSOE
     preparation (see paragraph 3.8.2 for a description of a chalk). With this module, the UDM
     can create cargo load and packing lists and management reports concerning unit
     equipment and personnel. Instructions for using this module are available from the on-
     line help screen in LOGMOD.
  1.5.5. MANPER-B. Within the MANPER module there are also two subsystems: the
  Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) and the Deployment Requirements
  Manning Document (DRMD).
     1.5.5.1. MANFOR. Similar to LOGFOR, the MANFOR subsystem contains details on
     the standard manpower requirements for each UTC. These files tell units the number of
     positions, by specialty and skill level, they must posture. In effect, the read-only
     MANFOR files identify required “spaces.” In conjunction with the LOGFOR files,
     military planners also use these files in feasibility planning. The MANFOR product is
     available from the base Manpower Office.
     1.5.5.2. DRMD. The DRMD subsystem provides the mechanism to assign “faces” to the
     “spaces.” This subsystem manages and stores the data on each individual a unit assigns to
     a primary mobility position. This subsystem gives the capability to easily make changes
     in those assignments when someone is not available to deploy. The main product is called
     the DRMD. This subsystem also generates other needed deployment documents such as
     contingency, exercise, and deployment (CED) orders. Just as with LOGPLANs, a unit
     must create DRMDs for each OPLAN, exercise, or actual deployment and maintain a
     current exercise DRMD that reflects the most challenging tasking. From the exercise
     DRMD database, simply add, delete, or substitute personnel as needed to support an
     actual deployment. Get the DRMD information through the Personnel Readiness
     Function (PRF) in the Military Personnel Element (MPE). Create these products from the
     UDM module of LOGMOD.
  1.5.6. CMOS and AALPS. The transportation community uses these two systems. CMOS
  draws on data units provide to LOGMOD and MANPER-B and from data obtained from
  AALPS. Movement requirements for each UTC must be entered by hand into AALPS.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                            11


1.6. UTCs—The Building Blocks. A UTC is a potential unit of capability focused on
accomplishing a specific mission the military Service component provides. A UTC can consist of
a manpower force element listing (MFEL) only, a LOGDET (equipment) only, or both
manpower and equipment. UTCs are represented by a five-character, alphanumeric code. All CE
UTCs begin with “4F.” War planners use UTCs to document total AF manpower and logistics
requirements needed to support the national military strategy during operational planning and
execution activities. The mission capability (MISCAP) statement associated with a UTC defines
the basic mission of the UTC. A right-sized UTC is one that provides a generic building block
capability. This provides greater flexibility to planners and enables optimal support to the
warfighting CCDR or component. UTCs are used across the range of military operations
(ROMO), whether for peacekeeping operations, humanitarian relief operations (HUMRO),
rotational operations, or combined with additional UTCs to meet OPLAN requirements. Small
UTCs that build upon each other may be necessary to provide greater capability at a given
location.
   1.6.1. There are two types of UTCs - standard and non-standard.
       1.6.1.1. A standard UTC is a UTC in the MEFPAK and Type Unit Characteristics
       (TUCHA) data file with complete movement characteristics in both files. Standard UTCs
       are used in JOPES/DCAPES to identify manpower and logistics requirements for
       deployment, movement planning, and plan execution.
       1.6.1.2. A non-standard UTC is a UTC in the MEFPAK and TUCHA file without
       complete movement characteristics. The two types of non-standard UTCs are “4FZ99”
       and “Associate” UTCs (A-UTC). Examples are 3FZ99 and 4FZZZ.
           1.6.1.2.1. There are occasions when a planner does not have a standard UTC to move
           manpower and/or equipment. A “Z99” non-standard UTC in the TUCHA allows a
           planner to enter the UTC “shell” into a TPFDD. The planner can then build specific
           detailed requirements in the TPFDD using DCAPES.
           1.6.1.2.2. Unit manpower that provides excess capability but cannot be captured in a
           standard UTC will be postured into an A-UTC. A-UTCs are placeholders for all
           deployable positions that cannot fit into an existing standard deployable UTC. Each
           functional area has an A-UTC to represent that functional area. The A-UTCs
           themselves are not deployable, but the authorizations postured within the UTC are
           deployable.
   1.6.2. Prime BEEF UTCs: Prime BEEF UTCs can be viewed on the Expeditionary
   Engineering           community         of          practice       (CoP)          at:
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=21340. This link provides
   a list of Prime BEEF UTCs, MISCAP statements, and the UTC manpower composition.
1.7. MEFPAK Responsible Agency (MRA), Pilot Units, and Non-Pilot Units. The AF (and
the other military services) uses the MEFPAK to create, store, and update the information on its
standard UTCs. MEFPAK has two subsystems: MANFOR and LOGFOR. The MANFOR
contains the MISCAP statement and the manpower details. The LOGFOR contains the LOGDET
and movement characteristics. Standard MEFPAK data for any UTC is adjusted only when
needed.
 12                                                 AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   1.7.1. A MAJCOM is assigned MEFPAK responsibilities for each UTC. The MRA ensures
   detailed MANFOR and LOGFOR data is developed, maintained, and entered into the
   MEFPAK database for use throughout the AF. The MRA generally does not do the work. It
   designates a “pilot unit” to develop the standard LOGDET. Note: AFCEC/CXX has been
   designated as the MEFPAK command and pilot unit responsible for all standard CE UTCs.
   1.7.2. CE uses the Equipment and Supply Listing (ESL) to identify specific items of
   equipment and supplies required to meet the MISCAP. The designated pilot unit acquires
   those items; establishes a good way to pack and load the equipment and supplies onto 463L
   pallets IAW AFI 10-401 to minimize the transportation requirements (footprint); and satisfies
   all restrictions placed on shipping normal, sensitive, and hazardous cargo. In effect, the pilot
   unit creates the “model” packing plan for each pallet. A load of equipment and supplies for a
   UTC is referred to as a cargo increment. Typically an increment is the load that fits on a
   standard 463L pallet or in a vehicle or a trailer. To more easily identify and track the loads,
   each cargo increment in a UTC has its own number.
   1.7.3. Utilizing the UTC ESL as the source document for development of the LOGDET,
   pilot units pack and weigh the pallets, vehicles or trailers and, through the servicing LRS,
   coordinate its change recommendations with all the non-pilot units to ensure they can posture
   the UTC as designed (non-pilot units are all other units that must posture the UTC). When
   everyone agrees to the packing standards, the pilot unit forwards the data to AF/A4LX,
   where the standard MEFPAK LOGFOR files are updated. Each quarter, the AF makes the
   updated information available to the joint planning community through DCAPES.
   1.7.4. Pilot units have an obligation to keep non-pilot units informed of changes in the
   LOGDET. Sometimes they send a message or email direct and sometimes the information is
   passed to the MAJCOMs.
1.8. FMs. A FM, as defined in the Chairman, Joints Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM)
3122.01A, JOPES Volume 1, Planning Policies and Procedures, is a planning and execution
tool that provides a means of logically grouping records, which facilitates planning, analysis and
monitoring. FMs may include both forces and sustainment. The elements of FMs are linked
together or are uniquely identified so they may be extracted from or adjusted as an entity in the
JOPES databases to enhance flexibility and usefulness of the operations planning and execution
process. AETF FMs are the basis from which the AEF lead wings are postured and sourced; in
addition, they are the basis from which provisional CCDR functional capability requirements are
sourced. Functional Area FMs provide an additional mechanism for packaging UTCs in larger
groups for “teaming” of smaller/modular UTCs when needed. UTCs are not static. They are
created, adjusted, and canceled in response to changing threats, organizational adjustments, new
equipment, and changing force employment strategies.
   1.8.1. Force Presentation FMs.
       1.8.1.1. The AETF FMs are defined as a grouping of combat and expeditionary combat
       support (ECS) UTCs with accompanying supplies and required non-unit re-supply and
       personnel necessary to sustain forces for a minimum of 30 days.
       1.8.1.2. The functional area FMs can also be a grouping of combat and ECS UTCs;
       however, they provide a more specific capability than the AETF FMs. They can be
       OPLAN-dependent or used for force tracking.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                              13


   1.8.2. AETF FMs. The AETF FMs are a method of packaging command and control (C2),
   operational mission, and ECS forces for presentation to a CCDR through the commander of
   AF forces (COMAFFOR) and component commanders. The modules were developed to
   provide a standardized template optimizing initial planning through rapid requirements
   generation.
      1.8.2.1. The AETF FMs consist of six scalable, modular elements: Open the Airbase, C2,
      Establish the Airbase, Generate the Mission, Operate the Airbase, and Robust the Airbase
      (Figure 1.2).

Figure 1.2. AETF FM Construct




      1.8.2.2. When utilized in concert, the scalable AETF FMs provide capabilities required
      to open, establish, and operate an Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) or Group (AEG).
      AEGs are normally formed utilizing the Generate the Mission FMs as tenant
      organizations at an AF, Joint, or coalition operating location as long as the Service/nation
      responsible for providing base operating support can provide sufficient support
      capabilities for the AEG to establish adequate C2 over assigned forces.
      1.8.2.3. Each element is built on capabilities required to accomplish specific processes
      necessary to achieve desired effects. The capabilities contained within each module
      element are designed to work synergistically.
   1.8.3. Open the Airbase. This module provides the capabilities to open an airbase, regardless
   of the follow-on mission. Open the Airbase forces will normally arrive first and assess the
   airbase for establishing minimum airfield operating parameters, developing C2, and
   supporting host-nation support capabilities. If extensive runway preparation is not required,
   then the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for this module is approximately 24 hours.
 14                                                 AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   1.8.4. C2. This module contains the capability to establish an AEW C2 structure, which
   includes initial maintenance group, mission support group, operations group, and medical
   group staffs. This module begins at some point on or after C-0 and must be in place prior to
   any command elements leaving from the Open the Airbase FM. The C2 FM IOC should be
   established in approximately 16 hours.
   1.8.5. Establish the Airbase. This module contains limited forces to bring the base to an IOC.
   This module will provide capabilities to build and modify existing and deployed support
   infrastructure (petroleum, oils, and lubricants [POL], munitions storage and operating sites,
   maintenance shelters, tents, electrical), establish 24-hour day/night mission operations,
   enhance force protection, and communications. Establish the Airbase FM begins at some
   point after C-0 with its efforts integrating with the Open the Airbase FM. This FM should
   achieve IOC in approximately 10 days. CE provides the bulk of Prime BEEF to this module
   as well as RED HORSE.
   1.8.6. Generate the Mission. The Generate the Mission FM corresponds to 13 missions
   areas. These Generate the Mission FMs will produce the desired military effects as requested
   by the CCDR. These FMs are intended to provide a rapid response and to conduct operations
   within 36 hours of initial arrival.
   1.8.7. Operate the Airbase. The Operate the Airbase FM contains mission support forces
   needed to achieve full operating capability. Forces within this module make the initial
   operating capabilities of the airbase more robust. This module will provide capabilities to
   enhance force protection, communications, cargo handling, and quality of life activities such
   as chaplain, fitness, library, health care, feeding and sheltering, and reach-back support. This
   module brings the airbase into a steady, robust state of operational capability. The timing of
   force flow begins on or after day C+2 and reaches closure on or before day C+14. This FM
   should achieve IOC in approximately 7 days. CE provides additional forces as needed.
   1.8.8. Robust the Airbase. The Robust the Airbase FM contains those support forces that
   would typically not arrive until 30 days after an operating location is established. This
   module provides additional ECS forces to robust the capabilities already in place from the
   previous FMs until a rotational operation can be implemented. The Robust the Base FM is
   considered part of the baseline structure for the AETF.
1.9. AEF. The AEF is the AF’s methodology for organizing, training, equipping, and sustaining
rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense strategy requirements. Through the AEF,
the AF supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of both permanently assigned
and rotational forces.
   1.9.1. AEF Structure. The AF’s total force is organized into equally capable AEFs plus
   Enablers. This is achieved by aligning AF installations and available UTCs into the AEF
   libraries so each AEF possesses roughly equal capabilities. The resulting AEFs plus Enabler
   libraries provide the forces available to meet the AEF schedule.
   1.9.2. AEF Battle Rhythm. This cycle includes periods of normal training, preparation, and
   on-call/deployment eligibility (Figure 1.3).
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                             15


Figure 1.3. Example AEF Battle Rhythm Cycle




      1.9.2.1. The normal training period concentrates on unit missions and basic proficiency
      events IAW applicable AF instructions and Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)
      requirements and may include Joint, AF, or MAJCOM exercise participation (exercises
      of less than 30 days duration) such as Eagle Flag and Silver Flag. Most contingency and
      deployment training should take place during this period.
      1.9.2.2. The final deployment preparation period focuses unit activities on specific
      deployment preparation activities and area of responsibility (AOR)-specific requirements,
      if known. Exercises of less than 30 days may be supported if the training is appropriate to
      AEF preparation.
      1.9.2.3. The on-call/deployment eligibility period is the “vulnerability” or “eligibility”
      window when forces assigned to the tasked AEF (plus Enablers) are available to deploy
      to meet known requirements, other operational temporary duty (TDY) requirements, or
      JCS exercises of 30 days or more duration. During approved surge operations,
      deployment commitments may extend outside the scheduled AEF deployment window to
      meet mission requirements. Individuals and equipment must not participate in any
      activity that directly impacts their availability to deploy during their AEF window unless
      specifically approved by the appropriate authority.
   1.9.3. AEF Availability. Forces postured in the AEFs will be used to meet known rotational
   expeditionary requirements and emerging operational requirements across the ROMO from
   humanitarian and disaster relief operations up to and including OPLAN execution. Forces
   allocated to the tasked AEFs but not tasked to deploy will remain in an on-call status to
   reinforce forward-deployed forces or provide additional response capability. All AEF forces
   are vulnerable for OPLAN tasking at all times, including the month immediately following
   redeployment.
   1.9.4. AEF Surge. If requirements exceed forces available the AEF is designed to surge to
   meet increased requirements. IAW AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air & Space
 16                                                 AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   Expeditionary Force (AEF), surge requires Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) approval
   because surge operations may impact the ability of the AF to satisfy other CCDR’s
   requirements and/or sustain sufficient ready forces to meet Strategic Planning Guidance
   (SPG) and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) requirements.
       1.9.4.1. Through surge operations, the AF can make available up to all AEFs plus
       Enablers, but will require a sustained period after this level of effort to reconstitute the
       force, during which time AF capabilities will be severely curtailed.
       1.9.4.2. Surge operations will not be used to support exercises or rotational presence,
       unless specifically directed by the SECDEF or delegated authority. When the capabilities
       to support requirements are not in the current AEF or available Enablers, AFPC/DPW
       will normally reclama these requirements to AF/A5 based on SECDEF prioritization
       guidance.
       1.9.4.3. Some capabilities may need to surge at different rates and durations to meet
       CCDR requirements.
   1.9.5. An AEF deployment can significantly reduce the support available at home station.
   After their forces have deployed, affected units should identify essential backfill
   requirements to their sourcing command. The sourcing command reviews the requirements
   and decides how to fill them.
   1.9.6. Prime BEEF teams are very much a part of the AEF concept, and our mission support
   taskings are unchanged. Initial engineer emphasis remains on force beddown, airfield
   recovery and augmenting RED HORSE as needed. CE also assists Security Forces in
   developing physical security measures for force protection.
1.10. Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) Designed Operational Capability
(DOC) Statement. UTC posturing is what the MAJCOMs load in the UTC availability (UTA).
The DOC statement identifies what is required to support wartime requirements (DW-coded
UTCs) and what is SORTS reportable. Some UTCs are AEF code DX and do not have to be
SORTS reportable IAW AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System.
   1.10.1. The DOC statement summarizes the unit’s wartime tasks and requirements. It does
   not establish taskings. The DOC statement identifies the capabilities a unit must have “on the
   shelf,” ready to go. OPLANs, OPORDs, functional plans (FUNCPLANs) and concept plans
   (CONPLANs) tell how, when, and where those forces are used.
   1.10.2. The DOC statement may be a printout from the SORTS-DOC Management
   Information System or an AF Form 723, SORTS DOC Statement.

recommendations, plans and assists the execution of readiness priorities, training, deployment
tasks, exercise planning, budgeting, and any other tasks as determined by the Commander. This
group should meet once per month, be chaired by the Commander or designated alternate, with
functional subject-matter-experts (SME). Codify the Prime BEEF Working Group’s activities
with a charter.

                                            Chapter 2

                                 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

2.1. Introduction. Management of the unit Prime BEEF program requires a proactive effort to
keep the teams staffed, trained, equipped, and ready to deploy. It is the responsibility of everyone
within the unit, from commander to each Airman. Every flight has a role in ensuring CE meets
the CCDR’s objectives.
2.2. Unit Commander’s Role. A commander should:
   2.2.1. In words and actions, repeatedly make it clear that each member in the unit is
   important to the Prime BEEF mission. Everyone should understand the unit’s ability to
   deploy and support combat operations is dependent on their support as a Prime BEEF team
   member. This emphasis should be part of the unit’s culture. All officers and
   noncommissioned officers (NCO) should share it with their subordinates. Make Prime BEEF
   activities your personal priority and demonstrate the value and importance with your
   presence at these events. Chair Prime BEEF working groups, attend home station training
   events alongside your Airmen, and encourage continuous improvement by asking members
   how to improve readiness for your unit. Ensure officers and NCOs learn and understand the
   details of Prime BEEF. Areas of interest include: (1) UTCs the unit must posture, (2) the
   MISCAP statement of each UTC, (3) the personnel/equipment requirements for their team,
   (4) how a team is mobilized and deployed, (5) what is expected of them and (6)
   understanding the unit DOC statement.
   2.2.2. Assign quality personnel to Prime BEEF leadership positions. The Prime BEEF
   program will only be as good as the personnel who manage it. Start by appointing the Prime
   BEEF manager and the UDM, then assign UTC functional SMEs. Brief and motivate them
   on the criticality of their responsibilities.
   2.2.3. Provide strategic direction. Early on develop goals and expectations for the Prime
   BEEF program. Clearly state those to the UDM and functional SMEs, and expect good
   “production” from them. Assist by supporting their efforts and demand others in the unit
   support them as well.
   2.2.4. Posture the Prime BEEF UTCs as assigned in the UTA listing and equip the Prime
   BEEF UTCs IAW the ESL. Ensure all Prime BEEF team members are organized, trained and
   equipped to perform their duties and all equipment is on hand and ready to deploy. Budget
   for equipment, supplies and training TDYs.
   2.2.5. Upon assuming command, when the unit’s DOC statement changes, and at the annual
   review, sign the DOC statement acknowledging understanding of the unit’s mission task
   IAW AFI 10-201. The DOC statement is, in effect, an order to posture the specified
   capabilities in the UTA. If the unit cannot meet DOC requirements for any reason, notify the
   MAJCOM Prime BEEF Functional Area Manager (FAM) and the local Plans & Integration
   Section for guidance.
   2.2.6. Get functional SMEs actively involved in monitoring their teams’ personnel, training,
   and equipment status. The functional SMEs should be thoroughly familiar with the team
   training requirements, equipment, and deployment procedures. Functional SMEs should be
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                   19


   responsible for organizing and coordinating team skills training. They should also perform an
   annual inspection and maintenance review of their teams’ equipment and supplies. Ensure all
   squadron leadership (officers and senior NCOs) are actively involved in supporting the Prime
   BEEF mission. Lessons learned from Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI
   FREEDOM (OEF/OIF) revealed UDMs cannot do the job alone. In fact, the UDM may be
   deployed. In this situation, success or failure in future taskings will directly relate to the level
   of effort (and emphasis) placed on training and educating the unit’s leadership.
   2.2.7. Determine the overall level of unit combat readiness. Objective factors portray the
   status of selected unit resources measured under the areas of personnel, training, equipment
   and supplies on hand, and equipment condition. For additional guidance see AFI 10-201.
   2.2.8. Ensure the Prime BEEF manager, UDM, or functional SMEs provide regular briefings
   concerning current and projected UTC staffing, training and equipment status, annual
   training schedule, and budgeting needs. Problem areas and corrective actions are appropriate
   items for discussion. Do not discuss classified SORTS C-levels in any meeting unless
   proper security measures have been taken.
   2.2.9. Conduct unit deployment exercises and inspections to determine the unit’s capability
   to mobilize and deploy personnel, equipment, and supplies as specified in the IDP. Use a
   self-evaluation program to keep the Prime BEEF program working effectively.
   2.2.10. Ensure the Prime BEEF manager works with the base Manpower Office to ensure
   UTC taskings can be satisfied by available authorizations in the unit manpower document
   (UMD).
   2.2.11. Whenever possible, convert one Prime BEEF military position to a civilian position
   to ensure program continuity. If a civilian is assigned to the Prime BEEF section, this person
   may be the best choice for the UDM. See Attachment 3 for the suggested Prime BEEF
   organizational chart. (Note: ARC forces align these two functions separately)
   2.2.12. As required, designate a unit war readiness materiel (WRM) monitor. This person is
   responsible for looking after WRM items, participating in the annual inspection by the
   installation WRM office, and maintaining the paperwork. Recommend selecting one of the
   equipment custodians or a Prime BEEF equipment NCO to do this job. In most CONUS
   units, the only WRM items are the 463L pallets, netting, and dunnage.
   2.2.13. Ensure a primary and alternate duty status program (DSP) manager is appointed
   IAW AFI 36-2134, Air Force Duty Status Program. This duty does not necessarily fall
   within the Prime BEEF Program but is critical to ensure military duty status is accurate to
   support contingency requirements.
2.3. Prime BEEF Manager and UDM Responsibilities. The Prime BEEF manager manages
the Prime BEEF program.
   2.3.1. General Responsibilities.
      2.3.1.1. The Prime BEEF section is the focal point for unit deployments and related
      UDM activities. UDMs, along with functional SMEs and squadron leadership, must
      understand the IDP and every task associated with deploying each UTC. If possible,
      ensure there is at least one alternate identified for every deployment task performed in the
      unit (see Table 2.1).

       2.3.1.2. Develop a working relationship with the installation deployment officer (IDO)
       and staff; these relationships are explained in detail in Chapter 6. Participate in base
       deployment planning and training meetings. Use staff assistance visits to improve the unit
       program.
       2.3.1.3. Understand the commander’s goals and priorities and keep the commander
       informed. The commander must know the status of team personnel, training, and
       equipment. Advise the commander about plans, problems, and proposed solutions.
       Schedule time each month to update the commander. As a minimum, do it when
       presenting the monthly ART, SORTS and DRRS report for the commander’s assessment.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                             21


     2.3.1.4. Push to get as much training time as possible, but work with the Operations,
     FES, Programs, Readiness and EM (R&EM) and EOD Flights to find a good balance
     between time spent on base O&M activities, on quality training, and on deployment,
     contingency, and warfighting preparations.
  2.3.2. Planning.
     2.3.2.1. Prepare CE inputs for the IDP. The IDO (usually from the Deployment &
     Distribution Flight in the LRS) provides the instructions and format for input to the IDP,
     previously called the “base mobility plan.” Review all annexes in the plan as other
     functional areas may task CE.
     2.3.2.2. Establish unit internal procedures to deploy Prime BEEF UTCs. Prepare detailed
     instructions and checklists for each deployment task. Instructions and checklists should
     cover: (1) unit deployment control center (UDCC) functions and set up, (2) personnel
     recall (See AFI 10-211 for example recall roster), mobilization, and processing, (3)
     equipment marshaling, preparation, and movement, (4) storage and issue of mobility
     bags, (5) storage, movement, issue, and control of weapons and munitions, (6) Prime
     BEEF team members’ responsibilities prior to, during, and after a deployment, and (7)
     post-deployment team demobilization and equipment reconstitution.
  2.3.3. Personnel.
     2.3.3.1. Assign personnel to Prime BEEF teams with support from the UTC functional
     SMEs. Individuals must meet criteria specified in AFIs 10-201, 10-210, and 10-403 to fill
     UTC positions and be eligible to deploy.
         2.3.3.1.1. Most active duty CE units have military manpower authorizations that
         exceed UTC requirements. These spaces are not excess but cover wartime attrition
         planning requirements and unit shortfalls. Individuals filling those UMD positions are
         not assigned to a standard UTC, but are still subject to deploy, and may be substituted
         for primary team members in the same AEF block’s vulnerability period who are
         temporarily unavailable. For active units, all military personnel are eligible to deploy
         and should be assigned to a primary or alternate UTC position. ARC units do not
         have additional authorizations; everyone is assigned to a primary deployment
         position. Note: Changing an individual’s AEF Indicator will only be done under
         extenuating circumstances IAW AFI 10-401.
         2.3.3.1.2. Assign personnel to deployment positions using a letter signed by the
         commander. Attach key information such as (1) unit deployment instructions and (2)
         AEF pair and individual pre-deployment and deployment responsibilities. Have the
         individual sign and date the letter indicating he/she understands and acknowledges
         receipt. Ensure MILPDS AEF information is updated within 15 days of date arrived
         on station IAW AFI 10-403.
         2.3.3.1.3. Team assignments require continuing adjustments. Always keep the
         commander informed of any permanent and temporary shortfalls.
     2.3.3.2. Assign personnel to deployment support positions such as cargo increment
     monitors, hazardous cargo certifiers, and cargo preparation/pallet build-up teams. These
     positions are detailed in Chapter 6.
22                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


        2.3.3.2.1. In coordination with team chiefs, identify deployment custodians (and
        couriers) for equipment, munitions, and weapons.
        2.3.3.2.2. Some positions must be appointed in writing. Be sure to keep appointment
        letters and certification requirements current. File copies in the management file (see
        paragraph 2.4) and in the individual personal readiness folders. Table 2.1 lists these
        positions, identifies the method of appointment, and indicates paperwork routing
        requirements.
     2.3.3.3. Work with the unit DSP manager who will ensure MILPDS is used to update all
     changes in an individual’s duty status condition as they occur regardless of the amount of
     time the member is not present for duty. The duty status and deployment availability
     (DAV) codes can limit deployment eligibility of an individual and can affect the unit’s
     ability to deploy a small UTC. The correlation of those codes to deployment eligibility is
     discussed in Chapter 3.
     2.3.3.4. When assigning personnel to a UTC, ensure the individual has an updated
     security clearance or is eligible for one. According to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security
     Program Management, positions identified for deployment will, as a minimum, be
     assigned a National Agency Check with Local Agency and Credit Check (NACLC)
     requiring access to Secret information for the in-country threat briefing. Members who do
     not have a clearance or are not eligible to get one will not be able to deploy into certain
     areas or on specific operations.
     2.3.3.5. Monitor the unit’s current and projected staffing. Notify the commander if
     shortfalls are long term and will degrade the unit’s combat support capability and SORTS
     C-rating, DRRS assessment or ART.
     2.3.3.6. When a person is newly assigned to a team, brief the new member on the
     following topics: (1) team assignment, responsibilities, and name of team chief, (2)
     Prime BEEF objectives and type of work to be performed, (3) directives and deployment
     plans that apply to Prime BEEF deployments, (4) training and exercise requirements, (5)
     local alert and recall procedures and responsibilities, (6) tool kits, team equipment,
     deployment bags, and personal items, and (7) personal responsibilities including
     financial, legal, and personal affairs. Attachment 2 provides additional details on
     suggested briefing topics.
     2.3.3.7. Create and maintain personal readiness folders for each military member
     assigned to the squadron. The minimum contents are based on Wing preference. For
     more information, refer to AFI 10-403 or the IDP.
     2.3.3.8. Brief each functional SME on their responsibilities. The briefing should cover
     functional SME responsibilities in all phases of contingencies, exercises, and operations
     such as planning and peacetime preparations for training, mobilization, deployment,
     employment, redeployment, and demobilization. Emphasize pre-deployment
     responsibilities for team management, equipment maintenance and inspection, and
     training. Consider developing generic checklists to summarize those responsibilities.
     Checklists can be stand-alone or incorporated into a unit deployment handbook. Advise
     functional SMEs of any program or procedural changes.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                              23


  2.3.4. Equipment and Supplies.
     2.3.4.1. Use UTC functional SMEs to assist in acquiring, maintaining and controlling
     Prime BEEF equipment and supplies (Attachment 4). Individual and team equipment
     requirements are identified in the Prime BEEF ESL available through the Automated
     Civil Engineer System, Personnel and Readiness (ACES PR). Acquire additional items
     (pallets, cargo nets, shipping containers, and packing materials) needed to prepare UTC
     cargo for shipment. Inspect, inventory, service, and test items and replace shelf-life items.
     This should be completed at least annually. Ensure reference materials in the team’s
     technical library are available and current; this includes technical orders (T.O.s),
     regulations, instructions, field manuals, etc. Have the Logistics Readiness office review
     the hazardous cargo paperwork at least annually.
         2.3.4.1.1. To ensure equipment and tools are always serviceable, designate
         responsible individuals or shops to maintain specific equipment items and vehicles.
         Be sure to establish inspection and maintenance schedules and report the status to the
         Prime BEEF manager.
         2.3.4.1.2. Using functional SMEs, annually inventory and inspect all Prime BEEF
         equipment. One method would be utilizing the Barcode Inventory Tracking System
         (BITS) if available at your location. Provide an annual report to AFCEC/CXX and the
         MAJCOM Prime BEEF FAM. Include items such as team kits, home station training
         (HST) sets, deployment bags (if stored by CE) and consolidated tool kits. Document
         the inventory and inspection results in ACES PR. Replace missing or unserviceable
         items.
         2.3.4.1.3. Keep an accountability file to hold custody receipts for deployed
         equipment and weapons. Acquisition, maintenance, and control of equipment and
         supplies are discussed more in depth in Chapter 4.
     2.3.4.2. Prepare standard cargo deployment packages/load plans for each UTC. Take
     advantage of the peacetime, no-pressure environment to build deployment packages/load
     plans for each of the unit’s Prime BEEF UTCs. Begin with the LOGDETs in the standard
     LOGFOR files and the ESL. Using the LOGDET, the Plans & Integration Section will
     create a LOGPLAN file in the LOGMOD system for each UTC. Be sure to forward any
     discrepancies found within the packaging process to AFCEC/CXX. This process is
     addressed in Chapter 5.
  2.3.5. Training. Limited resources and time for training have forced the CE community to
  find other ways to train. The first source of information is AFI 10-210, Chapter 4. It gives
  specific (mandatory) guidance on contingency training requirements for all Prime BEEF
  personnel. AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1 provides general guidance on developing a unit
  training program.
     2.3.5.1. Ensure personnel are trained. Identify training requirements for each Prime
     BEEF team member and schedule, document, and monitor the training status of each
     individual using ACES PR. Periodically provide team chiefs with the training status of
     team members. Training requirements are listed in AFI 10-210.
24                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


     2.3.5.2. Determine who will conduct the required in-house training. It can be done by
     functional SMEs or by qualified individuals from other CE flights (such as FES and
     EOD). Be sure the deployment support personnel and teams are also trained.
     2.3.5.3. Make arrangements for training conducted by other base organizations. Several
     base agencies provide required training. The Prime BEEF manager should appoint one or
     more individuals to work with other units to identify requirements and schedule training.
     Additional sources of excellent training may be found utilizing other services such as
     Army, Navy or Marines for AF-compatible requirements such as Convoy Security,
     Personal and Work Party Security, Contingency Vehicle Operations, Self-Aid and Buddy
     Care, etc., especially if such units are available on or near the installation. A little leg
     work and face-to-face coordination could result in outstanding training being afforded to
     Prime BEEF personnel.
     2.3.5.4. Develop objectives and scenarios for unit and local exercises. Functional SMEs
     or experienced team members should participate to maximize the training opportunities.
  2.3.6. Deployment.
     2.3.6.1. Keep personnel and cargo deployment data current. A base builds its deployment
     process to meet its most rigorous OPLAN tasking. To simplify deployment preparations,
     keep the unit’s deployment databases up to date, especially the “canned” exercise DRMD
     files and the LOGPLAN files (including the cargo load and packing lists). These
     databases tell who will deploy and what cargo they will take.
        2.3.6.1.1. The PRF and the base Plans & Integration Section will periodically ask to
        have the information in the LOGPLAN and DRMD databases validated. Be sure to
        adjust the LOGPLANs when changes occur in the UTC LOGDET.
        2.3.6.1.2. Keep all shipping paperwork current. This includes documents such as
        Shipper’s Declarations of Dangerous Goods and DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling
        Data/Certification.
        2.3.6.1.3. Guidance on maintaining deployment data, reports, and documents is
        found in Chapters 3 and 5.
     2.3.6.2. Develop a unit deployment handbook. To be most helpful, it should contain
     everything an individual needs to know about the unit Prime BEEF program and their
     responsibilities. A unit deployment handbook serves as a ready reference for personal
     deployment preparations to include highlighting the base deployment process, summarize
     functional SME/member responsibilities, listing local points of contact, etc.
     2.3.6.3. Ensure team members satisfy individual deployment responsibilities.
     Periodically check to make sure each team member is up to date with their
     immunizations, has received the training required for overseas deployments, holds a valid
     driver’s license, has dog tags, and has satisfied their other personal deployment
     preparation responsibilities (see paragraph 2.7). This responsibility can be assigned to or
     shared with functional SMEs. Periodically provide functional SMEs with the
     immunization status of team members.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                           25


     2.3.6.4. Periodically brief unit personnel on the Prime BEEF program and any changes in
     unit deployment procedures. Brief individual responsibilities, program changes, current
     activities and exercises. Make the briefings interesting. Use photos or videos to show
     teams in action. These briefings can take place in conjunction with other unit training or
     commander’s calls. They can be given to the entire unit at one time, to one shop, or to
     each Prime BEEF team. When possible, include all military and civilian personnel. It is
     helpful when everyone is aware of the AF CE mission and Prime BEEF roles.
     2.3.6.5. Utilize the Prime BEEF Manager/UDM playbook to outline program
     responsibilities. This playbook is a good source of information for set-up and
     management of the Prime BEEF and UDM programs. It can be accessed through the
     following link: https://cs.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/ProgramGroups/Pages/default.aspx.
  2.3.7. Prime BEEF Management.
     2.3.7.1. Prepare the SORTS report. The unit SORTS monitor or alternate must prepare
     the supporting documents and calculations and draft the SORTS report for the unit
     commander. The SORTS report must be submitted each month or when any measured
     area rating or overall unit C-rating changes IAW AFI 10-201 guidance. Maintain a record
     of the unit’s C-ratings. If the unit is tasked to provide resources in direct support of
     another unit, provide timely SORTS data to personnel in the receiving unit so they can
     prepare their SORTS report (see Chapter 7).
     2.3.7.2. Prepare budget requests for Prime BEEF equipment and training. Develop
     budget inputs prior to the annual budget call. Identify or forecast Prime BEEF funding
     requirements for TDY, equipment, supplies, exercises, munitions and training. Use data
     from the previous year’s training, exercises, and equipment inspections and the latest
     ESL to identify requirements.
        2.3.7.2.1. Include the travel and TDY costs to deploy personnel to the Silver Flag
        Exercise Sites (for the year scheduled to deploy) and formal school training. If the
        MAJCOM tasks the unit for a deployment or offers a formal training school slot, ask
        the MAJCOM to fund the training.
        2.3.7.2.2. Research other funding opportunities. For example, units participating in
        military operations or exercises can sometimes use the exercise/operation fund cite to
        procure equipment and supplies needed to support the exercise or operation. If the
        unit is selected, ask the budget office or MAJCOM CE FAM for the fund cite. Be
        pleasantly persistent. A “no fund cite available” answer from the base budget office
        can mean they have not yet received any information about the exercise/operation.
        Ask them to check with their MAJCOM.
        2.3.7.2.3. Develop a list of unfunded requirements and update it throughout the year.
        Use the list to compete for end-of-year fallout funds. Have the paperwork ready to
        order the required equipment/supplies quickly if Wing funding is approved.
     2.3.7.3. The unit ART monitor or alternate must prepare the ART report for the unit
     commander. The ART report must also be submitted each month or when any UTC status
     changes to include tasking. Refer to AFI 10-244 and Chapter 7 of this Pamphlet for
     additional information.
 26                                                    AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


         2.3.7.4. Keep a Prime BEEF management file/continuity folder. Keep a file or folder to
         organize the unit’s Prime BEEF information. The file should make it easy for everyone in
         the Prime BEEF element to find information on the “status” of the teams.
   2.3.8. Reports and Documents. Table 2.2 provides a short summary of the reports and
   documents to use to manage the Prime BEEF program and deploy UTCs. It also lists the base
   units (with likely office symbols) that should be able to provide these products. Use of these
   reports and documents is discussed in the following chapters. The products are listed in
   alphabetical order. Many personnel system products are sorted by personnel accounting
   symbol (PAS) codes. These eight-position, alphanumeric codes are used to identify each AF
   unit. Some large CE units (most often CE Groups) have more than one PAS code. For those
   units, request products that include all CE PAS codes.

       2.4.6.3. End of deployment reports.
2.5. Information Management. The ACES PR module is the approved system, as identified in
AFI 10-210, Prime BEEF managers have to manage and document all Prime BEEF-related
requirements dealing with personnel, training and equipment. ACES PR is designed to aid Prime
BEEF managers in day-to-day operations. Prime BEEF managers must perform varied tasks such
as personnel availability, equipment and mobility management, plus ensuring required unit
training is accomplished. Some of these tasks have complex business rules such as calculation of
UTC equipment for reporting. Prime BEEF managers will find tools incorporated into the PR
module to aid in these tasks. ACES PR will help manage all UTA postured UTCs. Ensure data
input into ACES PR is timely and relevant. The commander, with support from the MAJCOM,
must budget for a recurring ACES PR training program for Prime BEEF element personnel.
Keeping information updated within ACES PR can save a lot of time and energy when
developing the monthly SORTS report, budgeting for equipment, posturing teams, scheduling
training, etc.
2.6. Common Problems–Suggested Solutions. The subparagraphs below address program
problems and solutions CE units have encountered. Similar experiences should be sent to
AFCEC/CXX to build on these lessons learned.
   2.6.1. SORTS training C-rating drops below C-1. To avoid this, keep continuous track of
   training status and forecast SORTS status to prevent being surprised during an inspection.
   Get training quotas early. Forecast Silver Flag training requirements to the MAJCOM. Refer
   to AFI 10-210 for information on SORTS reporting exceptions/waivers.
30                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


  2.6.2. Deployment data and shipping documents are not current. Complications arise when
  engaged in a local exercise or actual deployment. Updating the DRMD and LOGPLAN data
  and shipping documents, as changes occur, eliminates this problem or reduces it
  considerably.
  2.6.3. Appointment or authorization letters not current. Keep hazardous cargo certifiers
  trained and their documentation up to date. If not done, cargo may not pass cargo processing
  during local or actual deployments. Weapons and ammunition pickup will be delayed if
  custodian appointments are not current.
  2.6.4. Internal information databases are not current. This complicates making accurate,
  reliable SORTS calculations. When out of date, the unit must scramble to get accurate
  information and perform the calculations and thus reduces the value of maintaining this
  information in the computer.
  2.6.5. The unit ignores “red flags” found in self-evaluations or in inspection reports of other
  units. Self-evaluations and inspection reports give the opportunity to identify and fix
  problems before others expose them.
  2.6.6. REPEAT findings from MAJCOM inspections. Review and fix problems identified in
  previous inspections, and make sure they stay fixed through regular in-house reviews.
  Include previous write-ups as part of unit preparation for announced coming inspections.
  2.6.7. Only one person is trained to prepare ART/DRRS/SORTS report. Always have at least
  three trained personnel who know where the information is kept and how to make the
  calculations, when primary person is TDY or on leave.
  2.6.8. Poor control of assets and poor maintenance of equipment. This is a problem that
  arises when a Prime BEEF team arrives at the employment base. It hampers their ability to
  support the mission. Depending on location, work-arounds can often be found, but there is
  little excuse for this situation.
  2.6.9. Poorly trained deployment support teams. Well trained and frequently exercised,
  deployment support teams (cargo preparation/pallet build-up teams, quick fix teams, local
  weapons and ammunition escorts) greatly simplify the deployment process.
  2.6.10. Individuals who do not take family care seriously. Invariably someone will deploy
  from the unit who did not make adequate preparations for family care. This does not affect
  the program or deployment, but it does take time, both at home station and at the
  employment location, to resolve the problem. Unexpected problems are a different story and
  deserve prompt attention. The solution is to include the local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)
  office in tailored unit briefings covering subjects such as powers of attorney for spouses and
  child care custodians, wills, designation of insurance beneficiaries, and financial
  management issues.
  2.6.11. Losing weapons. Unit members must understand that loss of a weapon is an
  extremely serious matter which can have severe financial and disciplinary consequences.
  Anyone who has custody of one or more weapons needs to keep hands-on protection of the
  weapon. Be sure to use custody transfer documents or hand receipts. File them in a safe
  place.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                           31


   2.6.12. Communication with MAJCOM FAM. Ensure open communication with your
   MAJCOM FAM, in many instances immediate answers and assistance can be provided when
   asked. Watch for data calls from your FAM asking for agenda items for upcoming Prime
   BEEF and Contingency Training Panels, ensure you solicit input from unit leadership.
2.7. Responsibilities of Other CE Flights. All CE flights have important roles in preparing
and deploying the unit’s Prime BEEF teams and all CE Flight Commanders will ensure their
flights cooperate with the Prime BEEF manager so teams are deployed on time, with the right
equipment and personnel. Flight Commanders have lead responsibility to ensure all flight
personnel are properly trained and equipped to deploy. The Flight Commander and/or Flight
Superintendent will ensure cooperation between their personnel and the Prime BEEF manager
for training and maintaining individual and team kits. The FES, Operations, Programs, R&EM,
and EOD Flight Commanders have the following responsibilities:
   2.7.1. Inventory and maintain respective Prime BEEF equipment kits. This includes all team
   and individual equipment.
   2.7.2. Identify personnel for UTCs, provide personnel forecasting and ensure deployment
   availability of assigned members
   2.7.3. Update recall rosters.
   2.7.4. Assist with developing LOGPLAN information and preparing shipping documents.
   2.7.5. Provide vehicles, operators, and communications to support deployment preparations.
   2.7.6. Provide input into the Prime BEEF annual training plan, monthly training days and
   field exercises.
   2.7.7. Provide trainers to conduct training requirements IAW AFI 10-210.
   2.7.8. Make personnel available for scheduled training.
   2.7.9. Provide information to the Prime BEEF manager on equipment status for SORTS,
   DRRS and ART reports.
   2.7.10. Compile/disseminate lessons learned from returning AEF teams.
2.8. Prime BEEF Liaison. In many CE units, the Operations Flight has the most military
members assigned of all flights, and therefore the largest commitment for deployment. Program
Action Directive 07-02 and AFI 10-210 created the Operations Flight Prime BEEF Liaison
position to assign support responsibilities to the senior enlisted leader within the Operations
Flight. Although not a member of CEX, the Operations Prime BEEF Liaison works closely with
the Prime BEEF manager to ensure Operations personnel are assigned, trained and equipped for
world-wide deployments.
2.9. Functional SME Responsibilities. Functional SMEs serve as team leaders with important
responsibilities in getting their teams ready for deployment. They should be involved in pre-
deployment and deployment activities such as planning, organizing, and conducting team
training. The SMEs should learn their teams’ capabilities and be aware of available equipment.
To develop leadership and redeployment experience, the SMEs should:

  2.9.1. Know the base deployment process for the team. Know what tasks must be completed
  and who should do them. This includes the tasks performed by CE teams and individuals
  providing deployment support for the team. Chapter 6 and its related attachments provide
  much of the deployment process information. Be able to manage the deployment activities
  for the team. Remember, someone will be the “UDM” for redeployment. Consequently, they
  should be able to use the information in the LOGPLAN database, know how to make
  changes through the UDM Module in LOGMOD, and be able to read and annotate the
  printed LOGPLAN Wing (or Tasked Unit) Materiel List.
  2.9.2. Set up the team’s organization and chain of command. Ensure all team members know
  the chain of command and are briefed on their responsibilities (this should be documented in
  each individual’s readiness file). Fully explain any special responsibilities assigned to
  personnel. Use the team’s chain of command during training periods and local exercises.
     2.9.2.1. In conjunction with the Prime BEEF section, designate the primary and alternate
     equipment, weapons, and munitions custodians for the team and ensure they are trained.
     Custodians will be responsible for the accountable equipment, weapons, and ammunition
     when the team deploys. At home station, the Prime BEEF manager is often responsible
     for equipment management, so before deploying, the custodians must sign for the
     equipment, weapons, and ammunition (see Chapter 4). One person can be custodian for
     all three accounts or the responsibility can divided.
     2.9.2.2. In coordination with the UDM, select the cargo, weapons, and ammunition
     couriers for the team. Select a minimum of two individuals for each chalk and ensure
     they are trained. Sometimes it becomes necessary to off-load cargo or to transfer cargo to
     another aircraft at an intermediate stop. If the second aircraft is smaller, the couriers may
     be asked to select which cargo will go first. Be sure the couriers know the priorities. A
     courier remains with all off-loaded cargo to ensure it arrives at the final destination.
     Again, one person can cover all three assets or the responsibility can be divided.
     2.9.2.3. Make sure there are personnel on the team who have been trained in cargo
     preparation, pallet build-up, and hazardous cargo packing and certification. They will be
     needed for redeploying the team. To improve equipment accountability during
     redeployment, consider including the equipment custodian on the pallet build-up crew.
     2.9.2.4. Designate someone to serve as the vehicle control officer. This individual will
     need to maintain control of the vehicles at the employment location, whether the vehicles
     are rented locally or are pre-positioned military assets.
  2.9.3. Monitor the team’s personnel situation and team capability.
     2.9.3.1. Keep abreast of individuals TDY, on leave, in the hospital, and awaiting
     permanent change of assignment or station, discharge, etc. The DSP manager and Prime
     BEEF manager can help in this area.
     2.9.3.2. Report changes in personnel and team status to all appropriate levels.
     2.9.3.3. Periodically assess the team’s ability to meet its DOC statement and determine
     its limiting factors (LIMFACs). If there are problems that cannot be solved, advise the
     Prime BEEF manager and the unit commander. Be prepared to offer solutions.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                           33


     2.9.3.4. Maintain a current recall roster with addresses and phone numbers of team
     members.
  2.9.4. Ensure all ESL-identified equipment is available, in working order, and serviced for
  deployment. First, know what team equipment is required and what capabilities that
  equipment provides. Know on what pallets or in what containers the equipment items are
  loaded. Conduct periodic inventories with the Prime BEEF manager to ensure all required
  team kit items are available and in working order.
     2.9.4.1. Ensure equipment items are maintained, calibrated, tested, or serviced as
     required by the T.O.s or manufacturers’ manuals.
     2.9.4.2. If something is lost or broken during an exercise or deployment, have it repaired
     or replaced. The custodians should do this, but the functional SME should follow up.
     2.9.4.3. Supervise the annual inventory of consolidated tool kits to ensure the tools are
     available and serviceable.
     2.9.4.4. Ensure current T.O.s, instructions, and manuals of equipment listed in the ESL
     are available for deployment.
     2.9.4.5. Observe the preparation, packing, loading, and palletizing of the team’s
     equipment and supplies. This gives a better appreciation for the effort and time required
     to perform these tasks.
  2.9.5. Plan, organize, and conduct team training. Work with the Prime BEEF manager to
  plan and organize team training. Then supervise, conduct, or participate in that training.
  Ensure training is documented on sign-in sheets and in ACES PR. Sign-in sheets need to be
  kept IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records. Keep records of which members
  receive team training and provide those records to the Prime BEEF manager. Monitor team
  training status from the records maintained by the Prime BEEF element. If someone is
  overdue for training, discuss it with the Prime BEEF manager and the person’s supervisor to
  ensure the individual is scheduled for and attends training as soon as possible. Be actively
  involved in developing the objectives and scenarios for unit and local exercises.
     2.9.5.1. Know the roles in establishing a bare base. In most contingencies, this will be
     the first and most challenging mission. Know how to site facilities and where to place
     utility systems. Understand how to construct physical force protection methods. Know
     the procedures for base recovery, hardening of facilities and utilities, reconstitution,
     redeployment, etc. Learn the information on contingency operations in the AFPAM 10-
     219 and Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222 series publications and in AFPAM 10-100.
     2.9.5.2. If not in the team kit, pack a contingency reference library either the paper
     copies or electronic versions.
     2.9.5.3. Develop personal deployment checklists. Consider the actions needed to deploy
     the team. Also consider what will be needed at the employment location to help assess
     the situation, determine available resources, and guide initial actions. We offer these
     ideas to improve the usefulness of checklists. Get a copy from your predecessor, modify
     it as needed, and leave a copy for your successor. Develop checklists with the help of
     other functional SMEs, senior NCOs, and officers. Share ideas and lessons learned. Have
     experienced personnel critique the checklists.
34                                                 AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


     2.9.5.4. Understand the mission tasking. Gather site information. Review any wartime
     operations files the unit may have on OPLAN employment locations.
     2.9.5.5. Review threat documents for en route bases and deployment locations. These are
     available at the base/wing Intelligence Flight or through the classified computer network.
     Teams need to know what situation they face when deploying
     2.9.5.6. Ensure team members are ready for deployment. When alerted for a possible
     deployment, conduct pre-deployment checks to ensure each person has completed
     personal preparations. Equally important is the need to prepare personnel mentally. As
     soon as possible, give them a “warning order.” Brief them on the expected mission;
     conditions; duration of the deployment; personal gear, equipment, and tools to bring;
     items to hand carry; reporting instructions, etc. Chapter 6 provides additional
     information on preparing the team for deployment.
     2.9.5.7. Contact the functional SMEs of any augmenting Prime BEEF units to discuss
     beddown taskings, plans, and leadership roles.
     2.9.5.8. Create the force beddown or base recovery plan of action. Clearly define the
     tasks for subordinates and make sure they understand their tasks, resources, and required
     completion times. Ensure the latest available data, plans and checklists are being utilized
     for beddown/recovery plans. Verify through appropriate personnel/offices/directorates.
     2.9.5.9. Become familiar with Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) assets
     and the role in developing and employing these resources.
  2.9.6. Lead the team during all phases of the deployment or exercise. The functional SME is
  responsible for directing and controlling their team members from the time of recall until the
  end of demobilization. Do not forget the paperwork. Ensure required officer and enlisted
  performance reports and letters of evaluation are prepared on time by the reporting officials,
  both during and after deployments. Reward exceptional performance. Prepare
  recommendations for decorations. Initiate disciplinary action when required. Pre-load the
  necessary publications, forms, and letters on compact disks or on the team’s portable
  computers.
  2.9.7. Complete end-of-deployment tasks. Responsibilities do not end upon return to home
  station.
     2.9.7.1. Submit a written end-of-deployment report IAW AFI 10-210. Do not get
     complacent if this requirement is not identified in the initial tasking. Keep a log of events
     during the deployment and record tasks, start/completion dates, crew sizes and skills,
     conditions, problems encountered and their solutions, lessons learned, superior
     performers, problem personnel, etc. Record anything that will help recollect the facts.
     2.9.7.2. Be prepared to give a deployment de-briefing to the commander, wing
     commander, or MAJCOM staff. Include lessons learned and recommendations to
     improve future deployments. The audience will depend on the level of interest in the
     deployment. The “hotter” the operation, the more likely a de-briefing will be needed.
     2.9.7.3. Direct the team to reconstitute the team kit/mobility bags and clean the weapons.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                         35


   2.9.8. Understand SORTS reporting. During deployments, the functional SMEs may have to
   provide SORTS inputs to the parent unit at home station or to the base SORTS manager at
   the on-site command post. Know how to calculate the measured factors and prepare the
   SORTS input. Chapter 7, as well as AFIs 10-201 and 10-210, provides guidance. The wing
   SORTS manager is the local expert.
2.10. Individual Deployment Responsibilities. Each Prime BEEF team member plays a role in
making any deployment a success, and it begins with pre-deployment preparations and continues
through demobilization. These guidelines apply whether deploying as a member of a team or
individually. Reference AFPAM 10-100 and AFI 10-403 for details on individual preparation
and deployment processing. Emergency-essential civilians assigned to mobility teams should
make the same preparations as their military teammates. The requirements can be found in AFI
36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce. Check with the Civilian Personnel Flight for
more detailed information.

                                         PERSONNEL

3.1. Introduction. Filling Prime BEEF personnel requirements is a straight-forward, five-step
process.
   3.1.1. First, determine the manpower requirements.
   3.1.2. Second, identify a qualified person to fill each required position.
   3.1.3. Third, ensure those personnel are eligible to deploy if assigned to a deployment
   position or able to perform the in-place task if assigned to a generation mission.
   3.1.4. Fourth, document the assignments in the MANPER-B system.
   3.1.5. Fifth, keep the MANPER-B database information current. The guidance in this
   chapter applies whether staffing the teams in peacetime or filling an actual deployment
   tasking. The focus is on deployment requirements, but this chapter does touch on in-place
   requirements. For specific guidance on assigning personnel to UTCs, see AFIs 10-401, 10-
   403, 10-201, and 10-210.
3.2. Identifying Manpower Requirements. The DOC statement specifies the wartime mission
or what in-place mission the unit must perform.
   3.2.1. Deployment Mission. For a deployment-only wartime mission, get the UTC position
   requirements from the MFEL in the MANFOR files. The MFEL specifies the required
   positions by AFSC and skill level.
   3.2.2. In-Place Generation or Combined In-Place and Deployment Mission. For in-place
   generation missions or combined generation/deployment missions, get the manpower
   requirements from the UMD. Because there is no standard manpower requirement for in-
   place generation missions, MAJCOMs determine the requirements for each base and create
   or adjust the UMD to reflect those requirements. If the unit also has a deployment tasking,
   the MFEL requirements are incorporated in the UMD. The positions are coded to reflect the
   wartime requirements.
       3.2.2.1. When using the UMD as the source document, check the manpower type codes.
       As a minimum, all MFEL-specified deployment positions should be listed and coded for
       deployment, and all emergency-essential civilian positions should be coded for either
       wartime, in-place (at overseas bases) or deployment. If the codes are in error, advise the
       base Manpower Office and the MAJCOM Prime BEEF FAM and request the codes be
       corrected. If in doubt, confirm the requirements with the MAJCOM Prime BEEF FAM.
       3.2.2.2. If the UMD requirements do not match the UTC requirements in terms of
       number of positions by AFSC and skill level, contact the MAJCOM Prime BEEF FAM
       and base Manpower Office.
          3.2.2.2.1. The mismatch may be a result of a conscious decision; for example, the
          UMD reflects a local staffing condition. In this case, nothing needs to be done unless
          a position conversion (military to civilian or vice versa) will fix the problem. Even
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                37


          then, a position conversion may have to be delayed until the incumbent vacates the
          position for whatever reason (e.g., promotion, transfer, retirement, termination).
          3.2.2.2.2. The mismatch could also be an error or an oversight. A quick call to the
          MAJCOM should clarify this.
          3.2.2.2.3. The Installation Management Flight can work these issues for the unit. In
          either case, work with the base Manpower Office to highlight any UMD/UTC
          mismatches in the SORTS reports.
3.3. Unit Manning. The UMDs for the active units will normally contain more military
authorizations (required and funded) than the minimum number needed for all Prime BEEF
teams.
   3.3.1. These additional authorizations are not excess to the unit. They exist to cover war
   planning attrition requirements and unit shortfalls. They also provide a small buffer of
   military personnel (assuming the authorizations are at least partially filled) to flesh out team
   vacancies at the time of deployment.
   3.3.2. The additional authorizations do not help when actual manning is less than 75 percent
   in a career field. Just list the shortfalls in the SORTS reports and highlight the impact to the
   SORTS C-level rating.
3.4. Critical Versus Non-Critical Positions. Each Prime BEEF personnel UTC has both
critical and non-critical positions.
   3.4.1. Critical Positions. IAW AFI 10-201, CE critical positions are defined as all officers
   and enlisted personnel other than 1- and 3-skill levels. Critical positions are those required to
   provide a core of skilled personnel the Prime BEEF team needs to respond to immediate
   beddown and base recovery tasks. From a beddown perspective, immediate requirements
   could include provision of minimum-essential facilities and utility services (electric, water,
   fuel), installation of an aircraft arresting barrier system, expedient expansion of aircraft
   pavements surfaces, initial placement of defensive fighting positions and obstacles for force
   protection. The immediate phase is further defined from a recovery aspect to include not only
   the repair of runway and taxiway damage but also the expedient restoration of ruptured
   critical utility lines (electric, fuel, etc.), damaged essential facilities (control towers,
   command posts, air operations, etc.), EOD, and CBRN operations required to ensure sortie
   generation. The minimum number of AFSs and skill levels essential to accomplishing
   combat force beddown and aircraft launch and recovery repair efforts are designated as
   critical positions. The intent is to provide a basic, balanced mix of skills for each UTC force
   package that serves as the nucleus for the engineer capability.
   3.4.2. Non-Critical Positions. These positions give an engineer unit the ability to perform
   several tasks concurrently, respond rapidly and effectively, and accomplish more manpower-
   intensive taskings efficiently. They are essential to complete immediate requirements quickly
   and to accomplish the short-term requirements. Short-term tasks can be deferred until aircraft
   are initially bedded down or, in the case of base recovery, until aircraft are launched. Short-
   term tasks comprise the bulk of engineer requirements. From a deterrence perspective, they
   include such actions as installing electrical power generation and distribution systems,
   replacing mobile generators, expanding the base perimeter defense network, constructing
   aircraft and facility revetments, and providing sustained operations and maintenance. From a
 38                                                    AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   warfighting perspective, short-term tasks include such items as base-wide debris removal,
   expedient repair of secondary utility distribution services, and expedient restoration of non-
   critical, yet essential facilities.
3.5. Assigning Personnel to Deployment Positions. Identify qualified individuals to fill the
required positions for each UTC listed in the unit UTA IAW AFI 10-401. Assign any remaining
unit personnel as alternates to UTC positions for which they qualify. When possible, assign
alternates against critical positions first. Individuals filling primary or alternate positions must be
eligible to deploy. When making assignments, follow the specific AFSC and skill-level
assignment rules in AFIs 10-210, 10-201, and 10-403 and UTC MISCAP. Standard rules are:
assign enlisted personnel to deployment positions based on their control AFSC (CAFSC), and
assign officers on their duty AFSC (DAFSC). Be sure to follow any assignment notes in the
UTC MISCAP. Firefighters must meet the DOD Firefighter Certification requirements as listed
in the 3E7X1 Career Field Education and Training Plan.
3.6. Filling Individual Shortfalls. There are at least four options for filling a UTC position if a
position cannot be filled from within the unit. The first two are used when an actual deployment
notification or deployment order is received. The next two can be used to fix long-term
shortfalls.
   3.6.1. On-Base Replacement. Identify shortfalls to the MPE. They will try to find a local
   replacement. If the unit knows of someone already, this can speed up the process. Getting
   replacements for non-CE specialties found in other units will probably be more successful.
   Occasionally some CE specialties (power production, heavy equipment, electrical, etc.) are
   found in other specialized units, but these personnel may already be committed to another
   UTC. This option may solve an immediate shortfall, but cannot be relied upon for a long-
   term fix.
   3.6.2. Off-Base Replacement. If the MPE cannot find an on-base replacement, they will ask
   for help from the MAJCOM. If the MAJCOM cannot support the requirement, it will send
   the requirement to the Air Force Personnel Center. The replacement will not likely deploy
   with the team. He or she will have to deploy individually and join the team at the
   employment location.
   3.6.3. Emergency-Essential Civilians. While it is not common, we do have civilian
   employees assigned to deployable Prime BEEF UTCs. Generally they are assigned to special
   teams. If a civilian employee is required on a UTC and that individual agrees in writing to
   deploy, and meets all requirements, then he/she can be assigned to a mobility position.
   Civilians in this status should be formally designated as “emergency essential.” Be sure to
   complete the emergency-essential paperwork with the Civilian Personnel Flight. The
   requirements are found in AFI 36-507. Coordinate emergency-essential requirements with
   the MAJCOM Prime BEEF FAM.
   3.6.4. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). Under certain circumstances, active force
   units can use Air Force Reserve IMAs to satisfy requirements that are difficult or otherwise
   impossible to fill. AFI 38-204, Programming USAF Manpower, provides the guidance for
   establishing these requirements.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                               39


3.7. Determining Deployment Eligibility and Availability. Determining deployment
availability is a four-step process. First, determine who is present for duty; second, determine
who is on leave or TDY and can be recalled and ready to deploy within the DOC response time;
third, determine who has any duty status or deployment availability codes that may limit their
deployment eligibility; and fourth, identify which of the remaining personnel can deploy. In
reality, these do not appear to be four distinct steps, because they are done at the same time. The
rules and procedures apply whether determining eligibility for an actual deployment or for
SORTS reporting (in a crisis, the Air Force can adjust the deployment availability rules). As a
minimum, each unit must determine the deployment availability of team members monthly for
the SORTS report. Units should keep its personnel status up-to-date, just as it does its equipment
status.
3.8. Updating the MANPER-B Database. To complete the process of filling UTC positions,
the team assignments must be loaded into the MANPER-B system. For each UTC position, the
unit must provide the individual’s name, social security number (SSAN), deployment sequence,
and chalk number. The unit must also identify any special individual responsibilities. The base
Manpower Office or the Military Personnel system inputs other required information. The
information in the MANPER-B database is used to create many documents: the DRMD,
Deploying Personnel Roster, CED orders, unit shortfall/LIMFAC reports, etc.
   3.8.1. Depending on which MANPER-B product is used, UTC positions are identified by
   different, but related, codes. On some reports, the position is identified by a deployment
   requirement identifier or a mobility position indicator. On a DRMD or Deploying Personnel
   Roster, the “ULN position number” identifies the position.
   3.8.2. When personnel and cargo are deployed, they are moved by vehicle or aircraft, and
   each “load” is processed as a “chalk.” The unit must identify the chalk number on which
   each individual will deploy and the order in which the personnel on the chalk will process
   (the “deployment sequence”). When a UTC is so large it must be split for movement, each
   part of the UTC is given a separate chalk number (the ULN remains the same). When making
   chalk assignments, distribute team leadership and skill experience between chalks to have
   leadership throughout the team in case a vehicle or airplane is delayed.
   3.8.3. When providing data for a deployment, list special responsibilities (team chief,
   courier, etc.) in the line remarks on the DRMD. AFI 36-3802, Personnel Readiness
   Operations, lists the standard codes used in CED orders to identify selected responsibilities.
   The MAJCOM or bases can add local codes to the list. Examples of the standard codes
   include: “C” if member is cargo courier or “B” if member is classified courier. Use
   additional codes as specified in supplements to AFI 36-3802.
   3.8.4. Input assignment information or annotate the latest DRMD paper product and return it
   to the PRF which will then make the changes in the MANPER-B system. Work with the PRF
   in the MPE during peacetime or with the Personnel Deployment Function (PDF), when
   activated following a deployment warning/execution order, to get the civilian assignment
   information included in the MANPER-B database. The PRF/PDF will load the civilian
   “face” to the space before making the DRMD database available. The Personnel community
   calls this a “force gain.”
 40                                               AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   3.8.5. Always keep the assignment information in MANPER-B current. Fewer changes will
   be required when getting teams ready to deploy, making the job easier. MPE will periodically
   provide a list to update, usually monthly.
3.9. Reporting Shortfalls and LIMFACs. Report shortfalls and any associated LIMFACs. Do
this through the monthly SORTS reports and, when deploying, in a unit shortfall/LIMFAC
report. Keep the Plans & Integration Section, PRF, and MAJCOM Prime BEEF FAM advised of
shortfalls and LIMFACs. LIMFACs are problems, deficiencies, or conditions that decrease
capabilities that could prevent a unit from accomplishing its wartime mission. LIMFACs usually
require assistance from higher headquarters to resolve.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                 41


                                            Chapter 4

                                EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES

4.1. Introduction. Prime BEEF teams are equipped light by design; they deploy with only
individual gear. This minimizes airlift requirements and enables the teams to deploy quickly. As
a result, Prime BEEF teams must rely on external sources for beddown assets, vehicles, heavy
equipment, construction materials, and supplies. Those sources include in-place and pre-
positioned stocks, separately deployed vehicles and equipment, and local vendors. The mobility
team kits provide essential tools and equipment needed to perform initial beddown and base
recovery tasks. The individual gear includes equipment and clothing for personal protection and
personal clothing and supplies for extended TDY needs. At home station, Prime BEEF teams
train for deployments using the mobility equipment, individual gear, and supplemental training
assets. Acquisition, storage, maintenance, and accountability of Prime BEEF mobility equipment
and load planning and preparation of cargo for deployment are significant responsibilities of the
CE unit, both at home and when deployed.
4.2. Required Equipment and Supplies. AFI 10-210, Chapter 5, requires CE units to acquire
and maintain the items listed in the CE-unique ESL for each UTC specified in their UTA. For a
unit to deploy those items, the requirements must also be included in the MEFPAK LOGFOR.
The ESL and LOGFOR databases contain different information and serve different purposes, but
together they describe the complete cargo deployment package for each Prime BEEF UTC. To
acquire an equipment item listed in the ESL, the requirement must also be included in an
allowance standard (AS). MAJCOMs specify the required equipment and supplies for in-place
generation missions. Because there is no standard for those items, they are not listed in the ESL
nor are they addressed in this chapter.
   4.2.1. ESL. The ESL consolidates Prime BEEF equipment and supply requirements in one
   document.
       4.2.1.1. The ESL serves three main functions:
           4.2.1.1.1. First, it lists all individual and team items (expendable and nonexpendable)
           a CE unit must requisition and maintain for each UTC. There are separate ESLs to
           specify requirements for personal clothing and accessories, mobility bags, special
           protective clothing and equipment, and UTC equipment packages.
           4.2.1.1.2. Second, it provides helpful information. It identifies items with a shelf-life,
           includes information for shipping documents, lists the T.O.s needed for the required
           equipment, outlines special packing instructions, identifies items which require
           calibration and testing, annotates items which require periodic maintenance and
           operations checks, and identifies centrally procured (depot funded) versus locally
           procured items.
           4.2.1.1.3. Third, and unique to the ESL, it is the baseline document for calculating
           equipment availability for SORTS reporting.
 42                                               AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


       4.2.1.2. When the ESL is updated, AFCEC/CXX will upload the new ESL into ACES
       PR.
   4.2.2. ASs. ASs prescribe the items and quantities of equipment units and individuals need
   to perform their peacetime or wartime missions. Only nonexpendable (accountable)
   equipment items are listed in the standards. ASs are the basis for authorizing and procuring
   nonexpendable mobility equipment. Units cannot order equipment items unless they are
   contained in a valid AS. All mobility equipment authorizations are mandatory. A unit must
   have each required equipment item on hand, on order, or included in an appropriate budget
   document (if the item is base procured).
       4.2.2.1. Table 4 1. lists the ASs for the equipment in the Prime BEEF UTCs. ASs 429,
       456 and 459 deserve special note, because they are the primary ASs for the Prime BEEF
       team mobility equipment. The other ASs in the table apply across the Air Force and
       includes CE allowances alongside those for other functions.

 provide special allowances for each MAJCOM in addition to those in AS 019.
 [3] AS 459 provides individual and chemical warfare defense (CWD) equipment allowances
 common to all MAJCOMs.
       4.2.2.2. An AS provides a lot more information for each allowed item. The most
       important information includes the stock number, the nomenclature, part number,
       allowed quantity, use code, and allowance identifier. AFMAN 23-110, Standard Base
       Supply Customer Procedures, Volume 2, Part 13, contains more information on ASs.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                           43


     However, the best sources of information are personnel in the Customer Service and EAE
     section of the LRS.
     4.2.2.3. In a standard such as AS 429, which provides allowances for many different
     units and UTCs, it is important to know which allowance identifiers apply. For example,
     AS 429 contains identifiers for RED HORSE, Prime BEEF, Prime RIBS UTCs;
     Readiness; and Exercise, Evaluation and Training Sites. Allowance identifiers are seven-
     position, alphanumeric codes that identify who, what unit, or what UTC is allowed an
     item (the first three numbers in the identifier are called the allowance source code (ASC)
     (the ASC is simply the three numbers of the AS) and the last four letters are called the
     allowance identifier suffix). The preface of an AS provides a functional description and
     details about each identifier.
     4.2.2.4. There are three ways to access ASs. First, establish a requirement through the
     base’s Publication Distribution Office for a copy of the Allowance Standard Retrieval
     System CD-ROM. Second, get a hard copy report from personnel in the EAE section or
     the Customer Service section in LRS. They can make on-line inquiries through the Air
     Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) and can sort the allowances by stock
     number or by allowance identifier. Third, download ASs from the AFEMS. Check with
     the CE materials acquisition section as they may already have these materials on hand.
     4.2.2.5. The need to know about ASs arises when the unit wants to order an equipment
     item and is asked for the allowance identifier. Most of the information can come from the
     ESL or LOGFOR. This means the pilot unit needs to do its homework to ensure the
     allowance identifiers are listed correctly in the LOGFOR databases. The allowance
     identifiers will be needed to order nonexpendable items for the HST set.
  4.2.3. MEFPAK/LOGFOR. The LOGFOR database is essential. It lists items and the
  equipment and supplies needed to pack and palletize. Those items include 463L pallets,
  cargo nets, shipping containers, nesting boxes, etc. The LOGFOR database contains the
  logistics details of each UTC and provides model load and packing lists for each cargo
  increment/pallet.
     4.2.3.1. Created by the pilot unit, the model load and packing lists identify all ESL
     mobility items (except personal and mobility bags), identify what containers the items are
     packed in, and show what pallet positions the containers and items are packed on. The
     Plans & Integration Section will make this product available.
     4.2.3.2. Do not confuse the LOGFOR Materiel List with the LOGPLAN Materiel List.
     The LOGFOR shows how the pilot unit loads its equipment and supplies. The
     LOGPLAN is unit specific and shows how the unit plans to pack the cargo for each
     OPLAN the unit is tasked to support. The LOGFOR data is the starting point for unit-
     specific deployment “load planning.” That topic is covered in Chapter 5.
  4.2.4. Process for Identifying and Adding New Requirements. AFCEC/CXX establishes the
  process the Air Force civil engineer community uses to establish and periodically validate
  equipment, supply and manpower requirements for our UTCs. Prime BEEF equipment and
  supply requirements are not static. Minor tweaks, such as code or stock number changes,
  occur every year. In those cases, AFCEC/CXX will correct the databases.
 44                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


       4.2.4.1. Every three years, each of the five functional areas will perform complete
       reviews of their UTC ESLs. That frequency provides for stability in requirements but still
       allows for needed change.
       4.2.4.2. Normally the functional panels will authorize ad hoc equipment working groups
       to perform these detailed reviews. Each working group will be chaired by the
       AFCEC/CXX functional manager and will be comprised of a voting member from each
       MAJCOM and ANG, and unit-level functional experts. Working with the MAJCOMs
       and ANG, each chairman will determine the exact composition of the working group.
       Individuals from other organizations who can provide special expertise may be invited as
       technical advisors, as required.
       4.2.4.3. AFCEC/CXX must refer all recommended changes to the Expeditionary and
       Emergency Services Program Group for approval/disapproval. AFCEC/CXX will then
       host an annual ESL/AS reconciliation meeting with the AS managers and MAJCOM
       representatives. When the AS databases have been updated, AFCEC/CXX will adjust the
       LOGDET in the LOGFORs to match the newly approved ESL. (Note: Even though
       reviews are conducted every three years, functional reviews are completed once a year.
       Consequently the ESL/AS reconciliation meeting is held annually but with different
       participants)
       4.2.4.4. Finally AFCEC/CXX will update ACES PR IAW the approved ESL (with
       LOGFOR data). The change decisions/recommendations will be made in time to
       influence annual budget submittals.
       4.2.4.5. Mission-critical and safety issues will not be held until the next scheduled
       review. They will be resolved immediately. AFCEC/CXX will immediately coordinate
       and resolve these requirements out of cycle with the MAJCOMs and ANG.
       4.2.4.6. Owning MAJCOMs or ANG will complete this process for MAJCOM/ANG-
       unique UTC requirements. To incorporate those requirements into the ACES PR
       database, the owning MAJCOM or ANG must provide complete ESL data on those
       UTCs to AFCEC/CXX. The owning MAJCOM or ANG determines frequency of review
       for their unique UTCs.
       4.2.4.7. Anyone in the CE community can suggest changes to Prime BEEF equipment
       and supplies requirements (See Attachment 4). Send your request to the
       MAJCOM/ANG CE FAM. If the CE FAM concurs, they will send it to AFCEC/CXX.
       Provide enough details to help everyone understand the need.
4.3. Mobility Equipment and Supplies. The composition of Prime BEEF mobility equipment
has evolved over the years and will continue to change as new technology creates better
products, as UTC mission changes dictate additional equipment, and as smart CE personnel think
of better ways to do the job. Mobility equipment and supplies are divided into four general
categories: (1) personal gear–items such as personal clothing, mobility bags, and special
protective clothing to sustain individuals for an extended period and protect them from the
hazards of the mission, (2) team equipment–items such as consolidated tool kits, UTC/team kits,
communications equipment, and vehicles that enable the team to perform its mission as specified
in its MISCAP, (3) force protection items–items include weapons, munitions, helmets, and body
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                             45


armor, and (4) pallet preparation materials-includes 463L pallets, cargo nets, and shipping
containers.
   4.3.1. Availability and Peacetime Use of Mobility Equipment. Mobility equipment must be
   ready for deployment within the time period specified in the DOC response time. The time
   limitation applies even when using the equipment for training. Units can use their mobility
   equipment and supplies for local training and exercises, but must ensure the items are
   immediately cleaned, serviced, and available for deployment after the exercise/training.
   4.3.2. Personal Clothing and Hygiene Items. All military Prime BEEF members must
   maintain a personal clothing bag. Civilian Prime BEEF team members should also keep and
   maintain a similar bag in anticipation of short notice deployments. Each person is responsible
   for acquiring personal bag items and for storing his or her personal bag.
       4.3.2.1. Minimum clothing requirements plus suggested hygiene and personal comfort
       items are contained in the ESL. The IDP may also specify personal requirements. The
       more stringent requirement is the bottom line. If the ESL directs one of a listed item and
       local guidance says two, two is the requirement. The tasking order for each deployment
       may specify additional items.
       4.3.2.2. Personal clothing should be packed according to the IDP. Generally, this means
       in A-3 bags, duffel bags, or commercial luggage with rounded corners, but not in
       footlockers or trunks. Refer to Air Mobility Command Instruction 24-101, Volume 14,
       Military Airlift Passenger Service, for additional guidance.
       4.3.2.3. Personal bags are usually hand carried from the unit assembly area to the
       deployment processing unit (DPU) where the baggage function then loads the bags on
       pallets by UTC. Baggage pallets are not included in the LOGFOR Materiel List nor in the
       LOGPLANs. Just like the weight of passengers is estimated, baggage pallet requirements
       are built into transportation planning.
   4.3.3. Mobility Bags. The deployment task order or AOR reporting instruction provides
   instructions on the numbers and composition of required mobility bags/pro-gear. The A-bag
   contains general support items for all types of contingencies; the B-bag contains extreme
   cold weather equipment; the C-1 bag contains the member’s CWD equipment.
       4.3.3.1. Requirements. Standard mobility bags are described in AFMAN 23-110, USAF
       Supply Manual. AFI 10-2501 also identifies the chemical, biological, radiological,
       nuclear and high-yield explosives individual protective equipment (IPE) items and
       quantities. ASs 016 and 459 cover mobility bag allowances. Prime BEEF bags contain
       more items than standard mobility bags. The additional items must be funded, controlled,
       and stored by the CE unit. These are sometimes referred to as X-bag items. When CE
       stores the mobility bags, the X-bag items can be consolidated with the A-, B-, and C-1
       bag contents.
       4.3.3.2. Options for Storage and Issue of Mobility Bags. At many bases, the Materiel
       Management Flight in the LRS builds and stores standard mobility bags for all units. At
       other locations, CE stores their own bags. Both options have advantages and
       disadvantages. The biggest advantage of storing the bags in CE is immediate availability
       for training and deployment. The disadvantage is CE earns no additional manpower to
       maintain the bags or the bench stock to support the bag inventory manpower comes out
46                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


     of hide. The LRS also utilizes AF and DOD supply inventory control databases and
     subscribe to other systems for materiel alerts and updates CE does not. Even if LRS
     stores the bags, CE must store the additional Prime BEEF X-bag items. With either
     option, there must be enough bags for each team member, and bags must be available for
     immediate deployment. There is no one correct way to build, store, and issue mobility
     bags. The next few paragraphs outline common methods, but keep in mind, each base is
     free to develop its own procedures.
     4.3.3.3. LRS Storage and Issue. Usually once a year, LRS will ask units to identify their
     standard mobility bag requirements. LRS then builds and stores mobility bags to meet
     those requirements. Depending on LRS, the mobility bags will be either individually
     sized or tariff-sized. Individually sized means items in the mobility bags are sized to fit
     one person, and the bags are stored for that person. Tariff-sized means mobility bags are
     built to accommodate the normal distribution of sizes one would expect to see in the Air
     Force; i.e., fewer small sizes, more medium and large, and fewer extra large. When the
     unit deploys, LRS is responsible for meeting the required response time and issuing bags
     with sizes most likely to fit. LRS is only required to provide tariff-sized bags, but many
     choose to individually size the bags. Find out when the mobility function in LRS
     normally calls for mobility bag requirements, and provide the CE input accordingly.
        4.3.3.3.1. If stored by LRS, the IDP should specify procedures for storing, issuing,
        and palletizing mobility bags within required response times. Often those procedures
        call for the team chief or other responsible person to draw tariff-sized bags for the
        entire team. LRS then immediately palletizes the bags. In practice, LRS’s mobility
        bag section will likely be overtasked. Consider sending a work party to help palletize
        the bags, especially if the unit wants to load the X-bags on the standard bag pallets. In
        that case, send the X-bags with the work party.
        4.3.3.3.2. Some bases choose to build and store individually sized A-, B-, and C-1
        bags. They may also issue A- (or A-1) and C-1 mobility bags on a hand receipt to the
        individual when he or she is assigned to a mobility position. (The A-1 bag consists of
        the canteen, web belt, and helmet) When deploying, all team members go to The IPE
        element to draw and sign for their bags. Those bags may be immediately palletized or
        can be transported to the CE assembly area for palletizing.
        4.3.3.3.3. If time permits before the unit deploys, draw the bags from the IPE
        element and have each person check the contents of his or her bags for size and
        serviceability. Replace unserviceable items. Conduct an item swap or replace poorly
        fitting items. Have team members place completed baggage tags on their bags,
        together with placing duplicate information inside the bag (in case the baggage tag is
        torn off). This is a good time to pack the X-bag items in A-, B-, or C-1 bags or simply
        place the X-bags on the same pallets as the standard bags.
        4.3.3.3.4. If tariff-sized, ensure the unit knows how many small, medium, large and
        extra large bags are needed for each UTC. Provide an exact count to the IPE element
        when drawing the bags for a deployment.
        4.3.3.3.5. There are advantages to CE when LRS stores mobility bags: (1) it requires
        less storage space, (2) only replacement stocks for X-bag items need to be kept, (3)
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                              47


         less time is spent on bag maintenance, and (4) replacement costs for standard bag
         items is avoided.
     4.3.3.4. CE Storage and Issue. Providing LRS agrees, CE commanders may have the
     option to store and maintain unit mobility bags as part of their control of Prime BEEF
     assets. See AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, for guidance.
         4.3.3.4.1. Include a copy of the inventory in each bag and keep the original on file.
         Keep track of bags with missing items, and fill the deficiencies as soon as possible.
         Once all items are in the new team member’s bags, the bags should be sealed.
         4.3.3.4.2. Mobility bags controlled by CE should be inventoried annually. Mark bags
         so they are easy to identify.
     4.3.3.5. Loading Mobility Bags. Palletizing should occur at the point of issue to
     minimize the bag drag, but it can be done at the DPU. Do not load mobility bags for
     positions vacant at time of deployment. If the unit draws bags from the IPE element,
     place the X-bags on the pallets along with the other bags. Some tasking orders may direct
     deploying individuals to hand carry their C-1 bag items.
  4.3.4. Special Protective Clothing and Equipment. Some AFSCs require special clothing and
  equipment to perform mobility duties. The items are listed in the ESL.
     4.3.4.1. The Base Respiratory Protection Program requires the base bioenvironmental
     engineer fit test the respirator to the environmental specialists and certify those personnel
     are trained annually in the proper use of respirators. This requirement is normally
     satisfied in the course of normal base maintenance activities. Firefighters perform their
     own respirator fit testing.
     4.3.4.2. The firefighters also use some of the special clothing and equipment for day-to-
     day base fire protection activities. When notified for deployment, these team members
     must bag their special gear before it is palletized.
  4.3.5. Consolidated Tool Kits (CTK). Prime BEEF teams pack CTKs for the hand tools. The
  ESL lists the contents of each CTK and specifies the number of CTKs required for each
  specialty in each UTC. Inventory each CTK annually. Seal kits after they are inventoried to
  minimize pilferage. Place a copy of the current inventory in each CTK. Keep the original of
  the current inventory in the office to assist with SORTS calculations. Copy the CTK tool
  listing from the ESL and use it for inventory and accountability purposes. Immediately
  replace missing or damaged items.
  4.3.6. UTC/Team Kits. A team kit contains items used by the entire team, items too big for
  the CTKs, essential but less frequently used items needed by a specialty, and power tools.
  The ESL identifies the team kit contents for each UTC. Nonexpendable equipment
  allowances are listed in the applicable AS. Inventory UTC/team kits annually. Team kits
  should be stored so those items used for training are readily accessible. If used for training,
  prompt actions must be taken to replace unserviceable items.
  4.3.7. Weapons. Weapons are authorized IAW AFI 10-210. The primary weapon used by all
  CE personnel (officer and enlisted) is the M4.
  4.3.8. Munitions. Prime BEEF mobility ammunition requirements can be found in AFI 10-
  210 and are further detailed in the ESL. Munitions allowances are contained in AFCAT 21-
 48                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   209, Volume 1, Ground Munitions. Munitions are shipped as hazardous cargo and are
   identified as such in the LOGFOR database.
   4.3.9. Communications Equipment. To provide the communications link for effective C2 of
   Prime BEEF activities, Prime BEEF team kits contain mobile radio equipment. The
   requirements by UTC are listed in the ESL. Communication system allowances are contained
   in AS 660.
   4.3.10. The 463L Pallets, Nets, and Other Pallet Preparation Materials. As mentioned earlier,
   the LOGFOR identifies the requirements for cargo packing and pallet building materials:
   pallets, top and side cargo nets, shipping containers, and nesting boxes. It does not list unit
   requirements for cargo covers and tie-down straps. When the unit receives a tasking to
   posture a UTC, contact the installation’s WRM officer or NCO to get the required number of
   pallets and cargo nets. If the WRM function is not assigned to the Plans & Integration
   Section, the WRM office will want the Plans & Integration Section to validate the 463L
   requirements. In addition, units must order and pay for the nesting boxes, pallet covers, and
   tie-down straps. The 463L pallets and nets used for unit deployment are WRM assets. They
   are managed according to AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance
   and Procedures.
   4.3.11. Classified Materials and Equipment. Prime BEEF teams deploy with some classified
   materials and equipment. For example, if the unit has the NAVSTAR Global Positioning
   System (GPS) in the team kits, then order the classified user keying material through base
   communications and securely store that material until the teams deploy. When deploying,
   this material must be properly packaged and placed under the control of the team’s classified
   couriers. Chapter 5 covers instructions and restrictions for marking containers or packages
   containing classified equipment or materials.
4.4. Prime BEEF Home Station Field Training Sets. Home station field training sets are
authorized at locations where Prime BEEF teams are postured. The training sets allow Prime
BEEF teams to participate in field training or local base exercises. These training sets include
tents, shower/shave units, bare base latrines, environmental control units, remote area lighting
system, etc. The nonexpendable equipment allowances for the home station field training sets are
reflected in Part L of AS 429 (see Table 4.2). Add expendable items to fit the unit’s needs.
4.5. Acquisition. Purchase of Prime BEEF supplies requires an understanding of the AF supply
system. Procurement rules govern this process, and the experts in CE materials acquisition and
LRS will ensure unit purchases are timely and in compliance with regulations.
   4.5.1. Payment. Prime BEEF equipment and supplies are bought from many funding
   sources. Initially it must be determined which items the unit pays for. The key element is the
   item’s budget code. The one position budget code indicates whether items are centrally
   procured, investment funded, or AF working capital funded (unit funds reimburse LRS).
   Generally, units pay for items with a numeric budget code; someone else pays for items with
   a letter code. Table 4.2 shows the supply budget codes that are likely to be seen. Table 4.3
   summarizes funding responsibilities for the major categories of Prime BEEF equipment and
   supplies. CE materials acquisition can provide the current budget code for any item and tell
   which items the unit must pay for. Most of the items the unit will pay for will carry a budget
   code of “9.” The ESL also shows the budget code for each item.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                                 49

Table 4.3. Funding Responsibility for Prime BEEF Equipment and Supplies
 CATEGORY OF PRIME BEEF          FUNDING RESPONSIBILITY
 EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
 CBRN Warfare Defense            MAJCOMs normally fund 100% of requirements. Budget for requirements in
 Equipment, IPE and UTC          the base financial plan. Unit must fund if MAJCOM funding is not available.
 Equipment and Supplies
 Communications Equipment        Generally units pay for equipment and replacement items. CE units must pay
                                 for additional items.
 CTKs                            Unit buys these items.
 EOD Individual Retention        LRS pays for initial issue of items that are part of standard mobility bags.
 Items                           Unit pays for all other items and for replacement items.
 Home Station Field Training     Unit buys expendable items and replacements.
 Sets
 Munitions                       Munitions and explosives are centrally funded. Local purchase using unit
                                 funds may be allowed under special circumstances.
 463L Pallets, Nets, and Other   The 463L pallets and cargo nets are depot funded. The WRM officer/NCO
 Pallet Preparation Materials    arranges to get these items for each UTC. The fiberglass shipping containers
                                 are also depot funded. Units pay for nesting boxes, pallet covers, and tie-
                                 down straps.
 Special Protective Clothing     Unit funds these items.
 Standard Mobility Bags          LRS buys initial issue of mobility bags. If LRS maintains the bags, then LRS
                                 pays for normal replacement of out-of-date or unserviceable items. If a unit
                                 maintains its bags, then the unit pays for bag maintenance. Unit also pays for
                                 any damaged, destroyed, or lost bag contents when standard bags are issued
                                 from and returned to LRS. Be sure to budget for this expense.
 Team Kits                       Unit pays for expendable items. Responsibility for nonexpendable items is
                                 based on budget code.
 Vehicles                        Vehicles are depot funded and centrally purchased.
 Weapons                         LRS acquires weapons. Unit pays for the slings, magazines, cleaning kits,
                                 holsters, and weapons containers.
 X-Bags                          Unit funds these CE-unique requirements.

   4.5.2. Budget for Unit Funded Items. Each year budget funds for replacement items and
   training munitions. Check the cost records for the last two or three years. If nothing has
   changed with the teams postured, base the estimate on the historical cost data. Anticipate
   needs. Know if an unusually large number of shelf-life items are coming due for
   replacement. Add funds if the unit is scheduled for a deployment or exercise so damaged or
   lost items can be replaced when the deployment is completed. When the MAJCOM tells the
   unit about changes to the ESL, be sure to budget for any items that are unit funded.
50                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


     4.5.2.1. Estimating the money needed to replace shelf-life items requires reasonably
     accurate records of on-hand shelf-life assets and the dates due for replacement. Maintain
     this information in the Prime BEEF inventory records. When the unit prepares the budget
     estimate, extract the requirements for the budget year. Obviously this is more important
     to do with the more expensive items. If the unit keeps the inventory records on the
     computer, program it to calculate the requirements. Use caution. Do not spend more time
     creating and maintaining a computer database than it takes to generate requirements by
     hand.
     4.5.2.2. Keep the CE commander informed of funding shortfalls and the impact on
     SORTS C-levels. If unable to fund all required items, list items in order of priority and
     buy in that order. Also keep the SORTS categories in mind. An unfilled requirement in a
     category with few items has a potentially greater impact on the SORTS status. If there are
     very special requirements or unforeseen circumstances, ask the MAJCOM for funding.
     4.5.2.3. The unit does not need to spend base money to upgrade or replace CBRN
     warfare defense items. Budget for CBRN individual and team equipment under program
     element code (PEC) 27593. Ensure the MAJCOM knows the requirements. Each year
     MAJCOMs get PEC 27593 funding, and units with established budget requirements are
     normally funded first. If the requirements are not in the base financial plan, the unit may
     not get them. Be prepared to fund any shortfalls with unit funds. Air Force Reserve
     Command (AFRC) units should use PEC 55166 for CBRN items.
  4.5.3. Ordering. Expendable items are easy. If the unit has the money, order them. All
  nonexpendable items in the ESL have approved allowance identifiers. Consequently, the unit
  can order any base-procured equipment item without getting further approval. Always be
  willing to identify local sources or suppliers. This can speed delivery.
     4.5.3.1. When ordering accountable items, the unit needs to specify the appropriate “use
     code” for each item. As the name implies, use codes indicate the intended use of vehicles
     and equipment. Table 4.4 lists and describes the codes. Use the “A” code for team
     mobility equipment and the “B” code for HST assets. The use code for each item is also
     listed in the ASs. When the unit annotates use code “A” on a requisition, it must also
     identify the UTC, increment number, and WRM code to show how the item is deployed.
     AFCEC recommends the unit use the UTC and increment number from the exercise
     LOGPLAN. Get the WRM code or codes the unit can use from CE materials acquisition.
     Properly coding the equipment simplifies the task of transferring equipment
     accountability to deploying custodians.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                             51


Table 4.4. Equipment Use Codes
                   USE CODE     DESCRIPTION
                   A            Mobility equipment
                   B            Support equipment
                   C            Joint-use equipment
                   D            WRM equipment and supplies

                   L            Vehicle asset (joint-use)
                   M            Vehicle asset (WRM)
      4.5.3.2. For depot-funded ESL items, the unit must submit the paperwork to establish the
      authorization and requirement in the LRS system (or transportation system for vehicles).
      Then the system consolidates requirements and makes a central buy. This can take
      months. When the MAJCOM advises the unit to prepare an AF Form 601, Equipment
      Action Request, for a new item, do not delay. The sooner all CE units get their
      requirements loaded in the logistics systems, the sooner the unit will get the depot-funded
      items.
      4.5.3.3. When ordering Prime BEEF equipment and supplies, do not forget to use the
      highest available priority. The unit needs to know two things. One, mobility equipment
      gets a decent priority. Two, ask CE materials acquisition to help sort out the priorities
      that can be used. For more information, start with AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2.
      4.5.3.4. The unit can also purchase many items with government purchase cards.
   4.5.4. Tracking. Track the status of equipment and supplies from the time they are ordered
   until the unit gets them in hand. A continuing slip in the estimated delivery date signals a
   potential problem that needs investigation.
      4.5.4.1. Daily Document Register (D04). This register provides a means for
      organizations to review all document numbers processed during the day by the LRS. The
      listing is in organization and shop code sequence. The documents are then listed in
      document number sequence for each activity code. By checking the D04 each time an
      order is placed, the unit can ensure the order was processed and can catch erroneous costs
      being charged to the account.
      4.5.4.2. Due-out Status List (R31). This listing provides data for review of current due-
      out requirements and provides optional due-in and status information for selected due-
      outs.
      4.5.4.3. Due-Out Validation List (M30). This monthly listing provides a means to
      monitor and verify that each due-out is still a valid requirement.
   4.5.5. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services Option. If the unit wants to cut
   down on out-of-pocket costs, especially for training items, consider shopping at DLA
   Disposition Services. Many CE units have acquired essentially new items through DLA
   Disposition Services because another unit no longer needed the item or it was excess to their
 52                                                 AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   needs. The unit can use the Internet to see what assets are available. The address is
   http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil.
4.6. Accountability. Civil engineers are obligated to account for nonexpendable equipment.
Maintain control over all Prime BEEF assets, both to ensure the items are available for
deployment and to provide the information needed for SORTS reporting. The Air Force uses
AFEMS to maintain worldwide visibility and accountability of its nonexpendable assets
(equipment and weapons), even when the items are deployed. AFEMS tracks equipment by base,
organization, and shop.
   4.6.1. CA/CRL (R14). The most commonly used product of AFEMS is the CA/CRL. It
   serves as a custody receipt, when signed by the custodian, and identifies quantities authorized
   and on hand within organizations and shops. Sensitive items are listed in the CA/CRL by
   serial number. All deployable, nonexpendable items listed in the ESL should be listed on the
   CA/CRLs and coded for deployment (use code “A”). For each use code “A” item, the
   CA/CRLs should also show the UTC and increment number on which the item will be
   deployed. If not listed, ask EAE to add those details.
   4.6.2. Custodians. The unit commander must appoint primary and alternate custodians for
   Prime BEEF equipment. Responsibility for storage, maintenance, and custody of Prime
   BEEF equipment can be and usually is divided between the Prime BEEF element, EOD, and
   FES, depending on which UTCs are postured. Team chiefs should select primary and
   alternate equipment custodians for each deploying Prime BEEF team. The commander must
   also appoint them by letter. Separate custodians can be appointed for weapons. The
   deploying property custodian is responsible for the deployed equipment and maintains
   responsibility until equipment is returned to its home base, transferred to another custodian,
   or assumed by a gaining base. Equipment custodians must attend the equipment custodian
   course given by the LRS. Primary and alternate equipment custodians should inventory the
   equipment at the same time to avoid any confusion if the primary deploys.
   4.6.3. Organization and Shop Codes. These codes are used to maintain separate
   accountability of items. Whether the unit uses one or many shop codes is entirely the unit’s
   decision (in the absence of guidance). Units can decide what equipment belongs in each
   equipment account (shop code). Units can have separate accounts for weapons, base support
   assets, each UTC, CBRN defense equipment, etc. Remember, for each shop code, the unit
   must have a custodian and maintain a CA/CRL.
   4.6.4. Transfer of Responsibility. The payoff for properly coding equipment items comes
   when it is time to transfer equipment responsibility from the primary to the deploying
   custodian. A current equipment list minimizes or eliminates last minute pen and ink changes
   to the transfer documents. When deploying or exercising, the LRS will usually print the
   transfer documents automatically. For other deployment situations, contact the EAE in the
   LRS and request mobility equipment listings as soon as the unit is notified of a pending
   deployment or receives a deployment tasking. If a deployment tasking order directs the unit
   to add equipment items, tell the LRS about the additional items. If time permits, do this
   before the LRS prints the use code “A” lists. If not, write the additional items on the transfer
   documents. If the tasking order tells the unit not to bring something, again tell the EAE. If
   the items are listed on the transfer documents, line through them.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                53


   4.6.5. Munitions. Munitions are accountable. Unit commanders must identify the individuals
   who can sign for and receive munitions for each UTC.
   4.6.6. Non-Equipment Assets. Be sure to keep track of the other Prime BEEF mobility items
   listed in the ESL. Civil engineers are required to use ACES PR to track UTC assets.
   4.6.7. The 463L Pallets and Nets. The base WRM officer/NCO maintains the accountability
   records for these assets.
4.7. Storage of Prime BEEF Equipment. CE units must provide storage for Prime BEEF
equipment and supplies. Since most mobility and training assets are durable, they do not require
unique storage. (Note:      Some CBRN defense equipment requires storage at certain
temperatures.)
   4.7.1. There are some special considerations:
       4.7.1.1. Protect unit assets by securing highly pilferable items.
       4.7.1.2. Due to the nature of team kits, store the items in a climate-controlled facility. If
       this is not possible, remove any items that may be damaged by extreme conditions and
       store them in a climatically controlled facility.
       4.7.1.3. Properly store the 463L pallets and cargo nets. Pallets must be properly
       supported when stored, usually on dunnage. If outside, they must be stored on a slope and
       kept rust-free. If not placed on loaded pallets, cargo nets should be hung up. Check with
       the air freight experts in the LRS or APS on the care of 463L items. Those organizations
       are required to inspect these assets periodically to ensure proper storage. Refer to T.O.
       35D33-2-3-1, Maintenance and Repair Instructions, Air Cargo Pallet Nets, for nets and
       T.O. 35D33-2-2-2, Instructions with Parts Breakdown, 463L Air Cargo Pallets, Types
       HCU-6/E and HCU-12/E, for pallets.
       4.7.1.4. Ensure equipment items with batteries, such as GPS survey equipment, radios,
       and meters are operationally tested and batteries are charged periodically IAW applicable
       T.O.s to maintain equipment effectiveness and life. Failure to make sure equipment is
       serviceable can lead to units not being able to accomplish their missions. Team kits may
       not always deploy with the unit that maintains them.
   4.7.2. Weapons are normally stored in the LRS’s weapons vault and managed by the
   Logistics Readiness office. They are packed in their shipping containers, ready for
   deployment. When deploying, CE draws the weapons from the LRS. When hand carrying
   weapons, the unit may want to ship the weapons containers with the teams.
   4.7.3. Each unit must request courtesy storage in the munitions storage area and execute a
   courtesy storage agreement with the Munitions Flight.
   4.7.4. Because weapons and munitions are sensitive items, they require special marking and
   handling. Positive control and security must be exercised over weapons and munitions at all
   times. For further information on movement and control, contact the Security Forces unit.
4.8. Inspection and Inventory. CE units need to inspect Prime BEEF equipment and supplies
annually IAW AFI 10-210 to ensure the items are available and serviceable to support worldwide
deployments.
 54                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   4.8.1. Weapons and ammunition are required to be inventoried semiannually.
   4.8.2. The Plans & Integration Section or the WRM officer/NCO will conduct a semiannual
   inspection to ensure the 463L equipment is stored properly and is in good condition.
   4.8.3. Team chiefs, deployment custodians, and team members should conduct the
   inspection and inventory of team equipment and supplies annually. Extracts from the ESL
   showing each required item and quantity make good inventory sheets. Be sure to have
   inspectors sign and date the inventory sheets.
   4.8.4. Document the inspection and inventory results. Update ACES PR and include the
   results in the Prime BEEF management files. If BITS is used send a report to your MAJCOM
   and AFCEC/CXX.
   4.8.5. Create an inspection and inventory schedule in ACES PR for all UTC equipment and
   supplies.
4.9. Maintenance. Some Prime BEEF equipment and supply items require periodic
maintenance, safety testing, calibration, or replacement. Refer to the latest ESL for current
requirements. Although equipment management responsibilities are assigned to the Prime BEEF
equipment custodians, operational checks and maintenance of equipment and supplies should be
the responsibility of the teams. Maintainers must follow applicable T.O.s regarding maintenance,
operation, and testing procedures and frequencies.
   4.9.1. Develop a maintenance schedule with the OPR. Use ACES PR to develop the
   schedule and print periodic reports. Some units also find it helpful to tag the items or mark
   the container those items are in with the date the items are next due for maintenance, testing,
   calibration, replacement, etc.
   4.9.2. Deployed teams must also satisfy maintenance, testing, and calibration requirements.
   Help the teams keep track of these requirements. Pack a copy of the maintenance schedule
   with the team kit. The unit can load the automated schedule on one of the team computers.
4.10. Reconstitution. After deployment or training exercise, team equipment and mobility bags
must be recovered and Prime BEEF records and inventories updated. Except for sleeping bags,
have individual team members clean and dry their mobility bag items before they return them.
Coordinate the cleaning of sleeping bags with the Force Support Squadron.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                 55


                                          Chapter 5

                    LOAD PLANNING AND CARGO PREPARATION

5.1. Introduction. No deployment activity has more potential to cause problems than preparing
the cargo for movement. All equipment and supplies must be properly packed, marked, labeled,
and documented before loaded on any aircraft or commercial vehicle. The most common
problems are improperly prepared paperwork and inexperienced cargo preparation teams.
Minimize these problems by keeping enough personnel well trained in pallet build-up and
document preparation. This chapter covers some of the factors to consider when preparing
equipment and supplies for air shipment. If the guidance in this pamphlet varies with local
rules, always follow the local rules.
5.2. Key References. While the air and surface freight personnel will always be the best source
for information, the following publications provide the rules for cargo packing, marking,
labeling, loading, and documentation. The most useful portions of each reference are annotated.
The key information from these publications is either included in this Pamphlet or is summarized
and the reader directed to the source document for details.
   5.2.1. AFMAN 24-204_IP, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments (the
   entire publication). This essential publication provides details for packaging, labeling,
   documenting, and preparing HAZMAT for shipment by military air.
   5.2.2. Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R, Part II, Cargo Movement,
   Chapter 204. All DOD personnel (military, civilians, and contractors) participating in the
   movement of regulated HAZMAT must comply with the rules of regulatory bodies
   governing the safe transportation of regulated HAZMAT for modes of transportation.
   5.2.3. DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Cargo Movement, Chapter 205. Outlines the requirements for
   shipping arms, ammunition, and explosives. It defines the transportation protective services
   and the security standards associated with each risk category.
   5.2.4. Federal Logistics (FEDLOG) Data. The FEDLOG database provides information by
   national stock number on all stock-listed items used by DOD services and agencies.
   5.2.5. T.O. 35D33-2-2-2. This T.O. provides instructions for loading pallets.
   5.2.6. T.O. 35D33-2-3-1. This T.O. outlines instructions for the use and care of cargo nets.
   5.2.7. T.O. 11A-1-46, Firefighter Guidance, Transportation, and Storage—Management
   Data. Provides information that is needed in order to complete the Shipper’s Declarations of
   Dangerous Goods for munitions and explosives.
   5.2.8. MIL-STD-129, Military Standard Marking for Shipment and Storage. Establishes
   package and container marking and labeling requirements.
5.3. Load Planning. A detailed deployment package/load plan identifies how many pallets
(increments) are used for a UTC, shows what ESL items (or substitutes) are packed in each
shipping container, and tells on which increment (pallet position) each stand-alone item and
container is loaded. The Plans & Integration Section maintains the deployment package/load
plan details in the LOGFOR module of the LOGMOD database.
56                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


  5.3.1. LOGFOR. The standard deployment package/load plan represents the best effort to
  prepare and pack the ESL items using the limited number of pallet positions (increments)
  allocated.
  5.3.2. LOGFOR to Baseline LOGDET. The process of turning a standard deployment
  package/load plan into a unit-specific deployment package/load plan requires a cooperative
  effort between the unit and the Plans & Integration Section. To begin, the Plans & Integration
  Section copies the standard LOGDET files into the LOGPLAN in the LOGFOR module.
  Then the Logistics Plans personnel provide the information to the unit through the UDM
  module, so the unit can adjust the LOGPLAN using the UDM module to show how the unit
  intends to load the equipment and supplies. For lack of a better term, let’s call this
  LOGPLAN data. The unit is not required to follow all details in the standard LOGFOR to
  create the LOGPLAN. Pack and load the ESL cargo to fit desires or specific requirements.
  5.3.3. Execution LOGPLAN. When one or more UTCs are tasked, the Plans & Integration
  Section copies the baseline LOGDET data to create an executionable LOGPLAN. The
  executionable LOGPLAN should contain the LOGDET data for equipment and supplies the
  unit actually loads and deploys. The executionable LOGPLAN is the source from which the
  unit can print load and packing lists for each cargo increment. Consequently, to minimize
  handwritten corrections to the load and packing lists, it is smart to keep the baseline
  LOGPLAN data current.
  5.3.4. Changing the LOGPLAN. A number of conditions can trigger the need to adjust the
  LOGPLAN. Examples include (1) adding a newly received equipment or supply item to a
  cargo increment, (2) removing an unserviceable item with no replacement, (3) using a
  suitable on-hand asset versus ordering the ESL-designated item, (4) changing the way items
  are packed to accommodate unit preferences, (5) using different shipping containers than
  called for in the LOGDET, and (6) adding or dropping items as directed in the deployment
  tasking order.
  5.3.5. Transportation. The unit cannot make changes that increase transportation
  requirements, especially airlift requirements. The unit can shift items and weight between
  increments, but it cannot exceed the total allowed weight for the UTC. The cargo weight in
  the LOGDET file is the maximum allowed weight. An exception is if the deployment tasking
  order specifies additional items. Adjust pallet loading as required to minimize increments and
  to avoid shipping compatibility problems with hazardous items. Work with the Plans &
  Integration Section to add the items and any required pallet positions.
  5.3.6. Load Diagrams. Some units have their pallet build-up crews prepare a load diagram
  for each cargo increment to remind them where each item is to be loaded on the pallet,
  vehicle, or trailer. Photos will also work.
  5.3.7. The Best Time to Make Changes. Avoid making changes after the base has been
  alerted for a deployment. If the changes are required by the deployment order, make the
  changes before the Plans & Integration personnel create the executionable LOGPLAN. If not
  possible, then the unit must make the changes by annotating the LOGDET load and packing
  lists created for the deployment.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                   57


   5.3.8. Hand-Carried Items. There are some hand-carried items in a Prime BEEF equipment
   package. A good example is laptop computers. Determine which items need to be carried and
   designate who will do it.
   5.3.9. Packing Extra Stuff. The unit has some flexibility to add items. Add those items to the
   LOGPLAN and reweigh the pallets involved. Add last-minute items by annotating the load
   and packing lists, but do not exceed the maximum allowable weight for that UTC.
   5.3.10. Local Expert Guidance. The Small Air Terminal or Traffic Management personnel in
   the LRS (or the air freight personnel in the APS) and the personnel in the Plans & Integration
   Section can assist and provide guidance on all matters concerning load planning and
   LOGPLANs.
   5.3.11. If a unit has questions about preparing or packing the equipment and supplies for a
   UTC and cannot get answers locally, contact AFCEC/CXX for help.
5.4. Pallet Building Materials. Civil engineers use standard containers and nesting boxes to
consolidate and pack most ESL items for shipment. To pack and load the equipment and supplies
for air movement, they need pallets, nets, tiedown straps, pallet covers, and dunnage.
   5.4.1. Shipping Containers and Nesting Boxes. The standard fiberglass shipping containers
   civil engineers use come in four sizes: (1) large bottom container (84” long by 42” wide by
   60” high), (2) large top container (84” x 42” x 30”), (3) small top container (62” x 42” x
   30”), and (4) small bottom container (62” x 42” x 60”). The standard nesting boxes also
   come in four sizes: (1) first box (36.75” long x 20.75” wide x 17.75” high), (2) second box
   (34.75” x 19.25” x 16.625”), (3) third box (32.75” x 17.75” x 15.5”), and (4) fourth box
   (30.75” x 16.25” x 14.375”).
       5.4.1.1. Since Prime BEEF teams can move by military or civilian aircraft, the cargo
       must be able to fit in all cargo aircraft. If internal slingable unit (ISU) containers are used,
       they are still required to have pallets and nets plus a plan if the ISU will not fit on the
       aircraft. In other words, units should have the standard fiberglass shipping containers on
       hand in order to maintain transportation flexibility.
       5.4.1.2. The nesting boxes are a convenient way to keep small items and packages
       together inside the shipping containers.
   5.4.2. Pallets. The 463L cargo pallet’s (HCU-6/E) overall dimensions are 88” wide by 108”
   long by 2¼” thick. However, the usable surface dimensions are 84” by 104”. This allows for
   2” around the periphery of the pallet to attach straps, nets, or other restraint devices. An
   empty 463L pallet weighs 290 pounds (355 pounds with nets). It has a maximum netted load
   capacity of 10,000 pounds and a maximum puncture load on the pallet skin of 250 psi. The
   desired load capacity is 7,500 pounds to help prolong pallet life.
   5.4.3. Pallet Nets and Tiedown Straps. There are three nets to a set: two side nets and one
   top net. The side nets (HCU-7/E) are green in color, and the top net (HCU-15/C) is yellow.
   The side nets attach to the rings of the 463L pallet, and the top net attaches by hooks to the
   side nets. These nets have multiple adjustment points and may be tightened to conform
   snugly to most loads. A complete set of 463L nets will provide adequate restraint for 10,000
   pounds of cargo when properly attached to a 463L pallet. A complete set of 463L nets (2 side
   nets and 1 top net) weighs 65 pounds. The nets have an inside and outside. The nets are
 58                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   positioned correctly (proper side out) when the openings of the net clamps face into the pallet
   load. This ensures the net tightening buckles face out, which makes them easily accessible.
   Five thousand-pound tiedown straps can be used in lieu of the cargo nets or used to provide
   supplemental restraint.
   5.4.4. Pallet Covers. A plastic pallet cover provides a supplemental barrier to protect the
   pallet contents from the weather.
5.5. Documents. The ESL identifies the items that require additional documents.
   5.5.1. AFTO Form 105, Inspection Maintenance Firing Data for Ground Weapons. This
   form is maintained for each weapon while it is in the Air Force inventory. The form provides
   the maintenance history for a specific weapon and stays with the weapon. When deploying,
   ensure the forms for all weapons are included in the correct weapons containers or carried by
   a team member. If a weapon needs repair at the employment location, the on-site combat
   arms training and maintenance unit will want the form for that weapon. This requirement is
   covered in T.O. 11W-1-10, Recording of Historical Data for Ground Weapons, and is
   discussed in weapons custodian training.
   5.5.2. AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data. Some T.O.s require users to maintain a
   maintenance record for an equipment item. The record must accompany the item when it is
   deployed. Examples of Prime BEEF equipment requiring this form are the generators and the
   EOD robots. A team member should carry the record or place it in a waterproof pouch
   secured to the item.
   5.5.3. Department of Transportation Special Permit (DOT-SP). In limited circumstances, the
   DOT exempts specific hazardous items from meeting the packaging requirements contained
   in 49 CFR regulations and AFMAN 24-204_IP. An exemption permit gives alternate
   packaging that provides an acceptable level of protection for the hazardous item. The
   exemption specifies how the item must be packaged and transported. There are just a few
   DOT-SPs that apply to Air Force shipments. Some of the self-contained breathing apparatus
   (SCBA) bottles shipped in CE UTCs for our firefighters fall into this category. So do fire
   extinguishers shipped in a military vehicle when mounted in a secure rack.
       5.5.3.1. To ship an item with an exemption, include a copy of the DOT-SP with the item
       and provide two additional copies for the Logistics Readiness personnel. Place three
       copies in the document pouch behind the increment placard, one copy on or in the item,
       and one copy in the team chief’s binder.
       5.5.3.2. To find the correct DOT-SP number, look on the item or its package. It should
       be clearly marked.
5.6. Placards, Unit Identification Markings, and Cargo Weights and Measurements. To
expedite the processing and tracking of cargo, each cargo increment must be properly marked
and labeled before it is shipped. The specific requirements vary based on how equipment and
supplies are packaged and whether they are hazardous or require special handling. Contact the
local Logistics personnel for detailed information.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                59


5.7. HAZMAT. Most items can be airlifted in support of military operations or contingencies.
However, all HAZMAT offered for military air shipments must be packaged, marked, labeled,
and certified in strict compliance with AFMAN 24-204_IP.
5.8. Preparing and Moving Classified and Sensitive Materials. Classified materials,
weapons, ammunition, and explosives require special protection during shipment. Protect each
increment based on the item that requires the highest level of protection. As a minimum, the
items must be kept under constant surveillance anytime they are removed from secure storage.
For unit deployments, each unit must provide escorts or couriers to perform this role for its own
cargo. Couriers must have a secret security clearance, be trained, and be appointed in writing by
the unit commander or designated representative. Follow local procedures for transporting
weapons, ammunition, and explosives on base. Those instructions will be listed in the IDP. The
IDP should also cover off-base movements.
   5.8.1. Never show security classifications on outer containers or on the documents attached
   to the outside of those containers. Likewise, outer container markings should not reveal the
   contents of the container or the classified or protected nature of the material being shipped.
   Last, ensure there is nothing contained in the transportation documents which reveals the
   presence of classified material within the container.
   5.8.2. Guidance for hand carrying or escorting classified materials is in DODI 5200.01, DoD
   Information Security Program and Protection of Sensitive Compartmented Information. That
   regulation specifies the requirements for preparing classified materials for shipment and for
   hand carrying or escorting those materials on military aircraft or military contracted aircraft
   operating from military bases. It also details the additional actions required to hand carry or
   escort materials through commercial terminals. On the assumption that units or individuals
   might have to move through commercial terminals, many bases choose to follow the more
   restrictive commercial rules when preparing their classified materials.
       5.8.2.1. The details are usually specified in the IDP. If not, follow the instructions in
       DOD 5200.1-R.
       5.8.2.2. As a minimum, double wrap the materials and place the unit address and the
       receiver’s address on the inner and outer covers or container (see DOD 5200.1-R). The
       unit commander authorizes appropriately cleared couriers to hand carry classified
       material. See DOD 5200.1-R, for required documentation. The unit security manager
       must brief each authorized member hand carrying classified material (see DOD 5200.1-
       R). The unit must maintain a list of all classified material released and keep the list until
       it can confirm all the material has been returned or properly turned over to another
       authorized unit (see DOD 5200.1-R). When following the commercial rules, place an
       exemption notice on the outer cover or container of a classified package and follow the
       additional requirements in DOD 5200.1-R.
       5.8.2.3. To ensure the unit always has an official classified courier, the information for a
       second person may be added to the official courier authorization letter or a separate letter
       for the second person can be processed.
   5.8.3. During movement, anyone on the team who has a secret security clearance can relieve
   the couriers, but the official classified courier must carry or escort the classified materials
 60                                                  AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   when processing through a civilian terminal. For sensitive cargo, the relieving person should
   also be weapons qualified.
5.9. Cargo Build-Up. Organize and train the cargo/pallet build-up teams as well as the other
individuals and shops that support cargo preparation, then practice periodically. This is the single
most important thing to do to reduce confusion when the unit is tasked with an exercise or actual
deployment.
   5.9.1. Load Shipping Containers. Protect the equipment. Pack equipment and materials in
   containers so the items do not shift during shipment. Fill in spaces with lightweight materials.
   5.9.2. The 463L Pallets.
       5.9.2.1. Clean and Inspect Pallets, Nets, and Cargo. Clean each pallet, net, container, and
       stand-alone cargo item.
       5.9.2.2. Provide Dunnage. Ensure dunnage accompanies each pallet during shipment.
       The easiest is three pieces of 4x4 wood timbers, each 88” long. Whenever a pallet is set
       on the ground, first place the dunnage to support the pallet.
       5.9.2.3. Load Pallet. Palletize cargo from the heaviest to the lightest. Distribute large and
       heavy objects evenly from the center of the pallet outward. Position loads symmetrically
       so the center of balance falls in the center of the pallet. Place lighter and/or smaller items
       on top or along the side of the heavier cargo.
       5.9.2.4. Weigh and Measure Loaded Pallet (with dunnage). Record the scale weight and
       pallet dimensions on the shipping placards attached to two sides of the pallet.
       5.9.2.5. Storing Loaded Pallets. If the pallets are kept loaded and ready to move, relax
       the tension on the cargo nets and straps until the cargo is ready to be moved.
       5.9.2.6. Carry Container Keys with the Cargo. Normally, containers will not be locked
       except as required to provide security for classified or sensitive items. Keys or
       combinations to locked containers must accompany the item to the in-check/cargo
       marshaling area. The courier will carry the keys for the classified or sensitive containers.
       The keys must be available to the aircrew en route to the destination.
   5.9.3. Vehicles, Trailers, and Gas-Powered Equipment. There are different preparation and
   loading procedures for vehicles, trailers, and gas-powered equipment (light carts, generators,
   and saws). Contact the local contact the LRS or APS for detailed information.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                                                61


                                                  Chapter 6

                                   THE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

6.1. Introduction. The unit can be tasked to deploy for any number of situations: war, major
accidents, defense support to civil authorities, disaster relief, and higher headquarters/joint
service exercises. Warning time may only be hours for war and disaster relief. The unit may be
tasked to deploy complete teams or just individuals.
   6.1.1. To be an effective participant the CE deployment manager needs to know the base
   players and learn the steps required to deploy. He/she then creates a unit task list and
   schedule of events that meshes with the base process; designates who in CE will execute the
   tasks; ensures those personnel are trained; and periodically practice deploying the Prime
   BEEF UTCs. Prime BEEF team chiefs also need to understand the process in order to deploy
   or redeploy their teams when away from home station.
   6.1.2. Details of the deployment process are found in AFI 10-403. It provides the basic
   requirements for Air Force deployment planning and execution at all levels of command to
   support contingency operations. It also describes the specific requirements for pre-execution,
   C2, and cargo and personnel preparation/reception in support of Air Force deployment and
   redeployment operations.
6.2. Base Process. The deployment process is made up of three sub-processes: personnel,
cargo, and C2. The personnel sub-process ensures the personnel are assembled, accounted for,
and ready to deploy. The cargo sub-process does the same for UTC equipment and supplies. The
C2 sub-process links those two sub-processes to ensure personnel move with their cargo; it
makes sure there are personnel, equipment, and facilities in place to perform all deployment
tasks, and it monitors the status of all preparation and processing activities to ensure personnel
and cargo are loaded and moved on time.
6.3. Base Key Offices. Deployment processing requires a cooperative base-wide effort to
efficiently and quickly move personnel and cargo and to create the paperwork to support their
deployment. Table 6.1 identifies the key offices and summarizes some of the tasks those units
perform. While each of these units has many deployment tasks, only the tasks which directly
impact CE are listed.

   6.3.1. Keep in mind organization titles and office symbols change and may differ from base
   to base. The IDP will tell the unit who does what at the base.
   6.3.2. The personnel in these key units can help get the Prime BEEF teams ready to deploy.
   Develop a good working relationship with them. Make their jobs easier by understanding
   their perspective and priorities and knowing exactly what information they need from the
   unit (and in what format). In the pressure of a real-world or exercise deployment, good
   working relationships smooth out the stresses that develop when problems arise that threaten
   the success of a deployment/exercise.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                              63


6.4. Prime BEEF Deployment Key Personnel. Chapter 2 discussed peacetime Prime BEEF
management responsibilities for selected individuals and CE flights. This paragraph covers the
roles and responsibilities individual CE personnel and ad hoc crews should perform to deploy
Prime BEEF teams. Each deploying team should have personnel trained to perform all cargo
preparation, certification, equipment custodian, and courier functions.
   6.4.1. UDM. The UDM is the single point of contact for the Plans & Integration Section—
   and other base units—concerning deployment of all unit UTCs. The UDM manages the unit
   deployment program and supervises and controls unit deployments. He or she must ensure all
   personnel in special positions are trained.
       6.4.1.1. The commander will appoint a UDM; although allowed by policy, it is not
       recommended the Prime BEEF Manager fill this role. If at all possible, assign the UDM
       to a home station support UTC. This keeps the UDM free to concentrate on getting the
       Prime BEEF UTCs prepared and to resolve problems immediately during UTC
       preparation and processing. This may not be possible in some units, especially ANG and
       AFRC units where everyone deploys. This suggestion does not exempt the UDM from
       deployment availability at OPLAN execution.
       6.4.1.2. Provide the name, rank, security clearance, office symbol, home address, and
       duty and home phone numbers of the UDM in writing to the Plans & Integration office
       with information copies to the Manpower Office and MPE.
   6.4.2. Team Chiefs. The primary deployment function of team chiefs is to make sure all of
   their team members are ready to deploy. This means assembling the team, working with the
   UDM and the UDCC to check individual deployment eligibility, making sure immunizations
   and paperwork are current, identifying shortfalls, ensuring team members have all their
   personal and mobility bags, checking on team equipment status, and issuing and accounting
   for weapons if required. Team chiefs should keep their personal affairs in order and their gear
   ready to deploy so they have time to learn about the employment location and anticipated
   operations while team members are getting ready to deploy. The unit commander appoints
   team chiefs who have a SECRET clearance. The Plans & Integration Section may ask the
   unit to identify the primary and alternate team chief for each tasked UTC. Typical
   information includes mobility position number, grade, and name.
   6.4.3. Cargo Increment Monitors. A cargo increment monitor directs all aspects of cargo
   preparation and documentation for one or more increments. For CE UTCs, one for each UTC
   works well.
       6.4.3.1. The cargo increment monitor is responsible to:
          6.4.3.1.1. Train assistants, as necessary, to ensure increments can be prepared and
          deployed within the time constraints established in the DSOE.
          6.4.3.1.2. Organize and direct the cargo preparation and pallet build-up crews and the
          weapons and munitions pickup crews.
          6.4.3.1.3. Maintain accurate packing and load lists for assigned cargo increments.
          6.4.3.1.4. Provide updates for LOGPLAN and any equipment shortfalls.
          6.4.3.1.5. Provide a quick-fix crew to accompany unit cargo to the cargo in-check
          area to resolve/fix any problems during cargo processing.
64                                               AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


     6.4.3.2. Appointment letters to Plans & Integration Section should include name, rank,
     and increment numbers for which each monitor is responsible.
  6.4.4. Hazardous Cargo Certifiers. These personnel prepare the Shipper’s Declarations for
  Dangerous Goods to certify HAZMAT is properly packed and marked for shipment. A
  certifier must work with or can be part of the pallet build-up crew to ensure hazardous cargo
  is properly located in shipping containers, on pallets, and in vehicles and that hazardous
  markings are clearly visible. Certifiers must receive Hazardous Cargo Certification training
  and be current (every two years). Appointment letters should include name, rank, and
  increment numbers that each person is qualified to certify. Normally, within a CE unit,
  certifiers are defined as Technical Specialists IAW AFMAN 24-204_IP and must meet the
  competencies and have completed appropriate training.
  6.4.5. Cargo Preparation/Pallet Build-up Teams. These teams marshal all UTC cargo,
  including weapons and munitions. They pack equipment and supplies in containers and load
  pallets and vehicles according to the load and packing lists and unit-developed pallet plans.
  They are responsible for marking all cargo containers, pallets, and vehicles with proper
  markings and placards. They ensure the pallets are properly netted and secured and the
  pallets contain all appropriate processing paperwork. One team per CE UTC is usually
  sufficient. Form this team from the deploying UTC, but first consider using personnel who
  are in attrition-filler positions and not assigned to a UTC. Also, use personnel who are
  ineligible to deploy to augment the team. These teams should receive pallet build-up and
  cargo preparation and marking training. The team must have personnel qualified to operate
  the vehicles used to load and transport the cargo.
     6.4.5.1. Weapons Team. The cargo preparation/pallet build-up team can perform this
     function, but units often create a separate team to expedite cargo preparation. While the
     pallet build-up team is preparing the cargo increments, the weapons team can pick up the
     unit’s weapons from the storage vault and transport them to the cargo preparation area.
     The weapons custodian must accompany this team.
     6.4.5.2. Munitions Team. The munitions team performs the same task for the munitions.
     The munitions custodian for the UTC must lead this team.
  6.4.6. Quick-Fix Teams. Units with many cargo increments often use quick-fix teams,
  especially when some of the increments must start cargo processing while others are still
  being built up. The quick-fix team is located at the cargo in-check point to fix any problems
  on the spot. Using quick-fix teams keeps the unit from having to shift a build-up team to the
  in-check point to fix a problem, only to have the build-up team miss a DSOE time because
  they got behind. The quick-fix team must be familiar with unit equipment; trained to address
  problems (i.e., frustrated cargo, HAZMAT problems, pallet and net problems); be readily
  identifiable on the flight line even at night; have personnel certified to sign shipper’s
  declarations and to drive transport vehicles and forklifts; and be properly equipped with
  safety gear, applicable shipper’s declarations, and the certifier’s appointment letter. For
  Prime BEEF UTCs with only a few increments, the quick-fix team may, in fact, be the cargo
  preparation team or only a few individuals from that team.
  6.4.7. Mobility Bag Team. Some units that draw mobility bags from LRS set up a mobility
  bag team to perform this task for the entire UTC. This is done to expedite the out-processing
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                          65


  time. Local issue procedures dictate whether this is possible or desirable and whether the
  bags are palletized at the issue point or taken back to the CE assembly area.
  6.4.8. Equipment and Weapons Custodians. Custodians ensure all cargo is accounted for
  from the time it leaves the Prime BEEF warehouse, throughout the deployment, and until it
  returns to home station. Units must appoint and identify in writing equipment and weapons
  custodians for both peacetime accountability and for each deploying team.
     6.4.8.1. An individual may be appointed as both equipment and weapons custodian for
     his or her team. Typically appointment letters for equipment custodians are sent to EAE
     in the LRS and to the mobility section for weapons. The letters should include the date
     trained. Plans & Integration Section and Security Forces may want copies.
     6.4.8.2. Deploying equipment and weapons custodians are responsible to:
         6.4.8.2.1. Obtain required training from the LRS.
         6.4.8.2.2. Act as a single point of coordination for equipment matters with both the
         home station and the deployed location Logistics Readiness units.
         6.4.8.2.3. Ensure all unit-owned equipment and weapons subject to deployment are
         identified with use code “A” on the unit’s CA/CRLs.
         6.4.8.2.4. Ensure all weapons subject to deployment are prepared for shipment IAW
         applicable directives.
         6.4.8.2.5. Develop procedures for movement control, issue, and accountability of
         weapons. This includes the recovery of issued weapons. Prepare and maintain
         necessary documentation.
         6.4.8.2.6. Ensure weapons are escorted and under surveillance at all times, and
         develop procedures for protecting weapons at the deployed location.
         6.4.8.2.7. Report to the EAE prior to processing equipment for exercise or real-world
         deployments to receive and sign deployed equipment listings.
         6.4.8.2.8. Inventory equipment items as they are loaded to ensure accountability, if
         desired.
         6.4.8.2.9. Maintain all necessary products and documents in their possession during
         the deployment.
         6.4.8.2.10. Upon return from deployment, inform the EAE that deployed assets have
         returned or provide status of assets.
  6.4.9. Munitions Custodians. The deployed custodian maintains accountability for munitions
  when they are pulled from the storage area until all unused munitions are turned over to a
  munitions account supply officer (MASO), either at the deployed location or back at home
  station.
     6.4.9.1. Appoint a unit custodian and a deployed custodian for each team. Use AF Form
     68 or prepare an appointment letter that includes name, rank, office symbol, and date
     trained and send to the MASO in the Munitions Flight.
     6.4.9.2. The deploying munitions custodians are responsible to:
66                                                 AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


         6.4.9.2.1. Obtain required training from the MASO.
         6.4.9.2.2. Develop unit procedures on proper documentation, handling, controlling,
         issuing, and transporting of munitions.
         6.4.9.2.3. Draw munitions from the storage area in time for them to be properly
         loaded in the UTC cargo. Ensure all munitions are properly packed.
         6.4.9.2.4. Ensure munitions are escorted/under surveillance at all times.
         6.4.9.2.5. Maintain a custodian deployment package that contains all necessary
         products and documents throughout the deployment.
         6.4.9.2.6. Upon return from a deployment, return unused munitions to the MASO.
         Account for all used munitions.
  6.4.10. Cargo Couriers. Prime BEEF couriers ensure protected cargo is secure and under
  surveillance at all times during the deployment movement. They also ensure the general
  cargo of the UTC gets to the final destination with its team. Select a minimum of two
  individuals for each chalk and ensure they are well briefed and weapons qualified. Any
  qualified team member can relieve a courier during the movement and while waiting for
  transportation. However, replacements should be well briefed on courier responsibilities and
  procedures. Couriers will release classified or sensitive cargo only to other couriers on the
  team or to transportation representatives using DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally Record,
  to transfer custody. The DD Form 1907 is not used when one team courier relieves another.
  Couriers must identify the person receiving the cargo and must verify the receiving person
  has the proper security clearance. Use a picture ID for personnel ID.
     6.4.10.1. General Cargo Courier. There are no special requirements for this position.
     Anyone on the deploying team can perform this task, but pick someone with common
     sense and initiative. On rare occasions, it is necessary to off-load cargo or to transfer
     cargo to another aircraft at an en route stop. If the second aircraft is smaller, the couriers
     may be asked to select which cargo increments will go first. The courier needs to know
     what the team chief’s priorities are in case the courier cannot make contact with the team.
     Usually a courier remains with all off-loaded cargo until it can be sent to its final
     destination. Couriers need to be prepared for this possibility.
     6.4.10.2. Classified Courier. Classified couriers must have a security clearance at least as
     high as the material being moved or hand carried. If the classified material is to be hand
     carried, versus packed in the cargo, consider appointing a second person to relieve the
     first. The courier is responsible for safeguarding the classified material during
     deployment and upon arrival at the deployment location. The courier must have an
     authorization letter that identifies the individual and describes the package the courier is
     carrying or escorting. Remember, each person must be included on the official courier
     letter or have his or her own authorization letter.
     6.4.10.3. Weapons Courier. This person is responsible for maintaining security and
     control of deployed weapons until the weapons are issued to individuals or turned over to
     a consolidated armory. This task can be performed by the weapons custodian. Prime
     BEEF weapon couriers should be small arms qualified on the 9 mm handgun and the M4
     rifle. Ensure couriers are fully knowledgeable of all aspects of weapons control to include
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                             67


       marking and securing containers, escorting and marshaling procedures, and safeguarding
       en route. The DOD security and transportation regulations do not require armed escorts
       when shipping 15 or fewer weapons; however, the arming rules change from time to
       time. Follow local instructions on arming the couriers.
       6.4.10.4. Munitions Courier. There are no special qualifications, but the courier needs to
       work with the munitions custodian to provide accountability.
       6.4.10.5. Pre-Departure Escorts. If possible, use otherwise untasked personnel to pick up
       and move weapons and munitions from the storage locations to the cargo preparation
       areas. This speeds the cargo preparation and loading effort since these personnel can be
       drawing and transporting the weapons while the deploying couriers are getting ready.
       These personnel must meet the courier qualifications listed above. Follow local
       instructions on whether escorts must be armed.
   6.4.11. UDM Module. At least two personnel in the unit must know how to input, modify,
   and extract information from the LOGMOD and MANPER-B systems using the UDM
   module. For lack of a better term, refer to these personnel as the UDM module gatekeepers in
   this pamphlet. This is the duty of the Prime BEEF manager. He or she should appoint an
   alternate from within the unit.
   6.4.12. VCNCO. The unit VCNCO can support deployments in two ways. First, he or she
   can set up the plans and procedures to ensure unit vehicles are in place when needed to
   support deployment activities. Second, the VCNCO can make arrangements to pick up copies
   of the vehicle maintenance histories from the Vehicle Maintenance Flight in the LRS for any
   vehicle deploying for more than 30 days. While the VCNCO can set up the procedures,
   execution of the plan requires full support from the CE work centers. Any shop with a
   vehicle designated for deployment support should automatically service the vehicle and take
   it to the designated assembly area. Likewise, the VCNCO can pick up the vehicle
   maintenance histories, but someone in the shop who “owns” the vehicle can also perform this
   task.
   6.4.13. Unit Security Officer. The security officer is responsible for ensuring all classified
   materials are properly packaged for shipment and couriers have the proper clearance, are
   briefed on their responsibilities, and are given their authorization letters along with the
   classified materials. The security officer should set up the procedures well before a
   deployment and should designate an alternate to perform these tasks in case he or she is not
   available at the time of a deployment. Copies of the paperwork can be kept in the UDCC.
   Create a file on the computer in the UDCC with the necessary appointment letters and the
   inspection exemption notice that will be attached to the classified package. When needed, the
   names of the couriers can easily be inserted into the canned authorization letters.
6.5. Choke Points. There are a few recurring, if not common, problems encountered during
deployment preparations and out-processing. This paragraph focuses on the problems which
deploying units create and can correct. These are offered to help avoid the mistakes others have
made.
   6.5.1. Unit poorly prepares cargo or fails to properly identify hazardous cargo, and this
   results in frustrated cargo. This can cause a last-minute change to the DSOE or even a late
   departure.
 68                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


   6.5.2. Unit does not identify shortages or unserviceable cargo early enough to source the
   items from other base units.
   6.5.3. Personnel are not prepared to deploy. Units should ensure their deploying personnel
   have all their required items BEFORE they report for processing at the PDF. Once a person
   reports for processing, it may be too late to run home for a forgotten item.
   6.5.4. No Shows. A unit should identify no-shows at unit assembly time. This will allow
   time to find a replacement.
   6.5.5. Unit does not weigh, measure, and mark cargo properly. This could cause changes in
   the aircraft load plans, resulting in having to move cargo to other loads and resulting in late
   departures.
   6.5.6. Unit does not send a knowledgeable person with their cargo to the in-check area.
   Problems that could quickly be resolved may result in frustrated cargo and delayed
   departures.
   6.5.7. Unit adds “last minute” items to their increments without adding them to the load
   and/or packing lists. This is especially dangerous if the items are hazardous. If items are
   added, they MUST be annotated on the load and/or packing lists, the cargo properly labeled,
   and the increment re-weighed.
6.6. SAFETY. Safety is very important. Pay special attention to safety zones around aircraft,
fuel levels, and proper protective and visibility clothing. Use safe handling procedures and

                          SORTS, ART AND DRRS REPORTING

7.1. SORTS Reporting. The SORTS report is an assessment of a unit’s personnel, training, and
equipment required to perform its mission. The assessment is backed by calculations on the
percentage of equipment and personnel available to perform the mission and the percentage of
personnel who are current in their training. The SORTS report provides additional information
about the unit such as its current location and whether some or all of its resources are deployed.
The primary purpose of SORTS is to give CCDRs a picture of the forces they have available to
support their missions. Consequently, they want accurate information and honest assessments.
   7.1.1. Units will update SORTS every 30 calendar days except when a change in status
   occurs which would necessitate an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change.
   7.1.2. Each unit will be provided a DOC statement indicating what is SORTS reportable.
   Generally, each unit that supports a wartime or contingency operations plan is required to
   report SORTS. The Joint Staff database (GSORTS) stores the last reported information on
   the readiness status of each reporting unit. SORTS data is available to each level of command
   by accessing GSORTS through the GCCS. SORTS provides the National Command
   Authorities, JCS, and unified commands with information they can use in crises: the
   identity, location, and resource status of individual units. It also enables Air Force and the
   MAJCOMs to monitor unit resources and training in peacetime.
   7.1.3. AFI 10-201 details the SORTS reporting requirements for the Air Force and
   designates which units will report SORTS data. For CE, that means every unit with a Prime
   BEEF team and every RED HORSE unit must submit SORTS reports. A few CE units are
   also required to report on in-place taskings that support OPLANs.
7.2. ART Reporting. ART is designed to provide units a mechanism to report a UTC’s current
and future ability/inability to fulfill its MISCAP statement. It highlights deficiencies within a
UTC and provides information to aid in resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady
state or crisis actions. ART gives units the ability to report UTC readiness levels and allows for
immediate updates and visibility for all levels of command to make decisions on the employment
of forces.
   7.2.1. Units will update the ART report every 30 calendar days except when a change in
   status occurs which would necessitate an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change.
   All updates are made in “real time.”
   7.2.2. AFI 10-244 details the ART reporting requirements for all deployable UTCs. The
   AFPC/DPW is the system manager for ART and gives advice on reporting policies and
   procedures.
7.3. DRRS Reporting. In compliance with Title 10, Section 117, DRRS is intended to be the
sole readiness reporting system for the DOD in the future and as such, DRRS is used by the
Office of the SECDEF, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Combatant Commands,
Services, and Combat Support Agencies. DRRS establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near
real-time readiness reporting system for the DOD to measure the readiness of military units to
meet missions and goals assigned by the SECDEF. As a capabilities-based system, DRRS
 70                                               AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


indicates what tasks a unit can accomplish, based upon the mission(s) for which a unit was
organized or designed. DRRS provides this information on measured units at a specific point in
time.
   7.3.1. Units will update DRRS every 30 calendar days, significant changes in the unit
   mission and/or task readiness levels will be reported with 24 hours.
   7.3.2. The CE DRRS Playbook can be found on the HAF/A7 Portal                           at:
   https://cs.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/CEPlaybooks/REM/ET/DDRS/Pages/default.aspx.
7.4. Reports Classification. All reporting requirements listed in this chapter are classified
when data is filled in.

and clear aircraft and traffic for departure from the country where located.
Aerial Port Squadron (APS)—An Air Force organization that operates and provides the
functions assigned to aerial ports, including processing personnel and cargo; rigging for airdrop;
packing parachutes; loading equipment; preparing air cargo and load plans; loading and securing
aircraft; ejecting cargo for in-flight delivery; and supervising units engaged in aircraft loading
and unloading operations.
Air Expeditionary Force (AEF)—An AEF is a package of aerospace forces tailored to create
theater commander’s desired effects. AEFs are the deployed wings, groups, and squadrons
attached to an AETF or in-place numbered air force (NAF) by MAJCOM G-series orders.

force presented to a joint force commander consisting of a deployed NAF headquarters, or
command echelon subordinate to a NAF headquarters, and assigned and attached operating
forces (command element plus operating forces). An AETF can be sized as a NAF, an AEW, or
an AEG, depending on the level and nature of the conflict and the size of the air and space
component required. The AETF is commanded by the COMAFFOR and is activated by
MAJCOM G-series orders.

Attainment—The point in time during the deployment when enough resources are available to
begin AEF force employment.
Augmentation Forces—Forces to be transferred from a supporting commander to the combatant
command (command authority) or operational control of a supported commander during the
execution of an operation order approved by the National Command Authorities.
Automated Air Load Planners System (AALPS)—An Air Force system that automates load
planning in support of worldwide deployment of forces and day-to-day cargo movement.
Bare Base—A base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support
operations to include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A
bare base must have a source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate
under bare base conditions form a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.
Base Level Assessment—The process of determining wartime base support requirements after
deployments and receptions have taken place.
Basic Plan—The part of an operation plan that forms the base structure for annexes and
appendices. It consists of general statements about the situation, mission, execution,

in a military operation, defined in five levels as follows:
(a) Normal Deployability Posture. The unit is conducting normal activities. Commanders are
monitoring the situation in any area of tension and reviewing plans. No visible overt actions are
being taken to increase deployability posture. Units not at home station report their scheduled
closure time at home station or the time required to return to home station if ordered to return
before scheduled time and desired mode of transportation are available.
(b) Increased Deployability Posture. The unit is relieved from commitments not pertaining
to the mission. Personnel are recalled from training areas, pass, and leave, as required, to
meet the deployment schedule. Preparation for deployment of equipment and supplies is
initiated. Pre—deployment personnel actions are completed. Essential equipment and supplies
located at CONUS or overseas installations are identified.
(c) Advanced Deployability Posture. All essential personnel, mobility equipment, and
accompanying supplies are checked, packed, rigged for deployment, and positioned with
deploying unit. The unit remains at home station. Movement requirements are confirmed.
Airlift, sealift, and intra—CONUS transportation resources are identified, and initial movement
schedules are completed by the Transportation Component Commands.
(d) Marshaled Deployability Posture. The first increment of deploying personnel, mobility
equipment, and accompanying supplies is marshaled at designated ports of embarkation
but not loaded. Sufficient aircraft or sealift assets are positioned at, or en route to, the port
of embarkation, either to load the first increment or to sustain a flow, as required by the
plan or directive being considered for execution. Supporting airlift control elements, stage
crews (if required), and support personnel adequate to sustain the airlift flow at on—load,
en route, and off-load locations will be positioned, as required.
(e) Loaded Deployability Posture. All first increment equipment and accompanying
supplies are loaded aboard ships and prepared for departure to the designated objective
area. Personnel are prepared for loading on minimum notice. Follow—on increments of
cargo and personnel are en route or available to meet projected ship loading schedules. Sufficient
airlift is positioned and loaded at the port of embarkation to move the first increment or to
initiate and sustain a flow, as required by the plan or directive being considered for execution.
Supporting airlift control elements, stage aircrews (if required), and support personnel adequate
to sustain the airlift flow at on-load, en route, and off-load locations are positioned, as required.

Execution Planning—The phase of the JOPES crisis action planning process that provides for
the translation of an approved course of action into an executable plan of action through the
preparation of a complete operation plan or order. Execution planning is detailed planning for the
commitment of specified forces and resources. During crisis action planning, an approved
operation plan or other NCA-approved course of action is adjusted, refined, and translated into
an operation order. Execution planning can proceed on the basis of prior contingency planning,
or it can take place in the absence of prior planning.
Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Category (ERRC) Code—A one-position, Air

exclusively associated with the preparation of operation plans, operation plans in concept format,
campaign plans, and operation orders (other than the single integrated operation plan) for the
conduct of military operations by the CCDRs in response to requirements established by the
CJCS. Joint operation planning is coordinated at the national level to support SECDEF
Contingency Planning Guidance, strategic requirements in the National Military Strategy, and
emerging crises. As such, joint operation planning includes mobilization planning, deployment
planning, employment planning, sustainment planning, and redeployment planning. Joint
operation planning is performed IAW formally established planning and execution procedures.
Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES)—A continuously evolving system
that is being developed through the integration and enhancement of two earlier planning and
execution systems: Joint Operation Planning System and Joint Deployment System. It provides
the foundation for conventional command and control by national- and theater-level commanders
and their staffs. It is designed to satisfy their information needs in the conduct of joint planning
and operations. JOPES includes joint operation planning policies, procedures, and reporting
structures supported by communications and automated data processing systems. JOPES is used
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                               87


to monitor, plan, and execute mobilization, deployment, employment, and sustainment activities
associated with joint operations. See also joint operation planning.
Joint Operation Planning and Execution System Reporting System (JOPESREP)—An
automated data processing structured information reporting system which uses standard formats
to record and send operation plan-unique deployment planning information among commands
and agencies. JOPESREP includes force requirement and routing data, force movement

is generated by the MANPER-B system when an individual departs or is projected for departure
for contingency.
Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP)—A short paragraph describing the mission
capabilities that planners expect of a specific UTC at execution. The statement usually contains
pertinent information such as the type of base where commanders will deploy the unit, the unit’s
functional activities, and other augmentation requirements necessary to conduct specific
missions.
Mobilization—The process by which the Armed Forces or part of them are brought to a state of

ports of embarkation, etc., are detailed to show a flow and workload at each location. Movement
schedules are detailed enough to support plan implementation.
Movement Table—As applied in this document, a table prepared by the transportation
component commands for each force requirement and each non-unit-related personnel or cargo
increment of the time-phased force and deployment data file concerning the scheduled
movement from the origin or port of embarkation, intermediate location, and port of debarkation
or destination. It is based on the estimated or planned availability of lift resources and, hence, is
not an execution document.
National Command Authorities (NCA)—The President and the SECDEF or their duly
deputized alternates or successors.
Non-Pilot Unit—A unit having a weapon system of functional tasking the same as a pilot (lead)
unit. The non-pilot unit normally is not subordinate to the pilot unit except when the MAJCOM
retains control of UTC composition or a parent organization develops a UTC to be distributed to
its subordinate units.
Non-unit-Related Cargo—All equipment and supplies requiring transportation to an area of
operations, other than those identified as the equipment or accompanying supplies of a specific
unit (such as resupply, military support for allies, and support for nonmilitary programs, such as

phased force and deployment data.
(a) OPLAN—. An OPLAN for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis for
development of an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies required to execute
the CCDR’s strategic concept and includes a movement schedule of these resources to the theater
of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in TPFDD files. OPLANs will include all
phases of the tasked operation. The plan is prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes,
and TPFDD files as described in the JOPES manuals containing planning policies, procedures,
and formats.
(b) CONPLAN—. An OPLAN in an abbreviated format that would require considerable
expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the

are not prepared.
(c) CONPLAN with TPFDD—. A CONPLAN with TPFDD is the same as a CONPLAN
except that it requires more detailed planning for phased deployment of forces.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Command authority that may be exercised by commanders at
any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within the command.
Operational control is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                               91


necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is
exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component
commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and
forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary
to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for
logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Outer Packaging—The outermost enclosure of a composite or combination packaging together
with any absorbent materials, cushioning, and any other components necessary to contain and
protect the inner receptacles or inner packaging.

                                         Attachment 2
    SUGGESTED BRIEFING TOPICS FOR NEW PRIME BEEF TEAM MEMBERS

A2.1. Introduction. This attachment provides suggested topics to discuss with personnel newly
assigned to a Prime BEEF team. Adjust these topics and add details as necessary for the unit.
The briefing details can be reduced for personnel with previous Prime BEEF experience. Give a
unit deployment handbook to each new member, highlight the information, but do not repeat the
details.
A2.2. Recommended Topics.
   A2.2.1. Unit Taskings. Explain the different UTC types which are postured at the base and
   what they do.
   A2.2.2. Team Assignment and Responsibilities. Tell what team the individual is assigned
   to, his or her mobility position number, and who the team chief is. Explain the structure of
   his or her team and how he or she fits into the team’s operation. Detail special
   responsibilities such as cargo couriers or weapons custodian.
   A2.2.3. Unit Prime BEEF Deployment Handbook. Give the new person a copy of the unit
   handbook or guide. Point out what is in the handbook.
   A2.2.4. Unit Notification and Recall Procedures. Ensure each individual is issued a recall
   roster. The instructions should indicate who will notify him or her of a recall, how much time
   he or she has to report to the unit assembly area (for example,1 hour), location of the unit
   assembly area, what uniform to wear, etc.
   A2.2.5. Base and Unit Deployment Process and Procedures. Highlight the deployment
   process used at the base and what is done in the unit to get ready to deploy.
   A2.2.6. Equipment. Briefly explain the personal and team equipment required for
   deployments.
   A2.2.7. Personal Mobility Bag. Provide a list of required personal clothing and equipment.
   This information is listed in the Prime BEEF Equipment and Supplies Listing (ESL). Add
   any locally required items to the list. Recommend including the consolidated list in the unit
   deployment handbook. Emphasize that each person must have all the personal items on hand
   and serviceable for all exercises and deployments. In addition to the personal bag items,
   identify the other items and documents which each team member must have in hand before
   processing for deployment.
   A2.2.8. Mobility Bags. Let the team member know what equipment he or she will deploy
   with, that is, A-, B-, and C-1 bags, weapon, etc. Immediately following this briefing is a good
   time to build up the mobility bags for the new member. Give the individual his or her
   mobility bag numbers and the bag numbering scheme. This reduces the possibility that the
   member will grab the wrong bag.
   A2.2.9. Weapons. Make it very clear to the individual that when issued a weapon it is
   critical he or she not lose it. Be sure to cover weapon safety.
98                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


  A2.2.10. Team Equipment. Briefly explain what equipment is in the team kit. Be sure to
  identify the items that were included primarily for his or her specialty. Provide a copy of the
  applicable pages in the ESL.
  A2.2.11. Training Requirements. Identify the base, unit, and personal training
  requirements and frequency. Also explain the types and duration of exercises that he or she
  can expect.
  A2.2.12. Personal Pre-Deployment Preparations. Explain that the individual must get his
  or her personal affairs in order before a deployment tasking is received by the base. This
  includes financial, legal, and personal issues. Point out that taking care of personal
  requirements well before deploying will make the deployment less stressful and more
  successful. Use commander’s calls to remind personnel of their obligations and where they
  can get help. Get supervisors to stress these points.
  A2.2.13. Family Care Plan. Stress the importance of planning for dependent care. Brief the
  individual to advise family members that there is a strong probability he or she may go on
  temporary duty (TDY) on very short notice. Point out that some family members have
  trouble adjusting to a separation. This can be reduced if the member prepares his or her
  family for the separation by talking about it. Advise the member to prepare a good family
  care plan and discuss its details with the remaining caregiver.
  A2.2.14. Personal Care Plan. Explain the value of a personal care plan to unmarried team
  members with no dependents. Point out some of the potential problem areas.
  A2.2.15. Financial Arrangements. In the financial area, brief the advantages of having a
  checking account. One advantage is that he or she can draw on the account while deployed.
  In addition, brief him or her on allotments that are available through finance to help in
  financial matters. Get the details from the base finance office.
  A2.2.16. Legal Arrangements. Legal preparedness is a critical element contributing to the
  success of the Prime BEEF mission. Members should be referred to the base legal office as
  soon as possible following assignment to the unit. With few exemptions team members will
  require assistance with such subjects will, powers of attorney, financial management, child
  care/custody matters, and other similar legal matters. Proper early legal preparation will
  contribute directly to smooth deployments.
  A2.2.17. Personal Documents/Paperwork. Advise the team member to keep his or her
  personal documents and records current. This includes his or her military identification card;
  DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data; and dependents’ ID cards.
  A2.2.18. Immunizations. Brief the team member on his or her responsibility to stay current
  on immunizations.

                   CIVIL ENGINEER EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT

A4.1. Purpose. To establish the process Air Force civil engineers (CE) will use to periodically
validate the equipment and supplies list (ESL) for CE equipment unit type codes (UTC).
   A4.1.1. This process provides the mechanism to ensure functional experts review existing
   ESL requirements for deployable UTCs and establish new requirements if need be. It ensures
   new technologies that significantly improve engineer capabilities are included in UTC
   requirements. This enables the CE community to standardize requirements between UTCs
   with similar capabilities.
   A4.1.2. The process provides for a corporate review through the CE Governance Structure.
   It stabilizes requirements for MAJCOMs and Air National Guard (ANG) units. It also
   ensures information used to manage and deploy Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force
   (BEEF) and RED HORSE UTCs maintained in several databases are kept synchronized.
   These databases include the CE ESL, the Logistics Force (LOGFOR) Module, the
   Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES) Personnel and Readiness (PR) Module, and the
   Allowance Standards (AS). The process allows for publicizing changes to ESLs so
   MAJCOMs and ANG units can be ready by designated implementation dates.
A4.2. Concept. Every three years, each of the five functional areas (Prime BEEF [PB]
traditional, PB Fire Emergency Services, PB Explosive Ordnance Disposal, PB Emergency
Management and RED HORSE) will perform complete reviews of their UTC ESLs. The
frequency provides for stability in requirements, but still allows for needed change.
   A4.2.1. Normally, the five functional panels will authorize ad hoc equipment working
   groups to perform the ESL reviews. Each working group will be chaired by the
   AFCEC/CXX functional manager and be comprised of a voting member from each
   MAJCOM and the ANG. Unit-level functional experts and career field managers will
   provide recommendations. Working with the MAJCOMs and ANG, each chairman will
   determine the exact composition of the working group. Other organizations/individuals that
   can provide special expertise may be invited as technical advisors as required.
   A4.2.2. The working groups have the authority to recommend change to UTC ESL
   requirements. Recommended changes will be elevated through the respective Panel and on
   to the Expeditionary and Emergency Services Program Group (EESPG) for a final decision.
   As required, recommendations may be elevated to the CE Council. AFCEC/CXX will
   publish and send the recommended changes to each MAJCOM and ANG.
   A4.2.3. After the ESL has been approved, AFCEC/CXX will host an ESL/AS reconciliation
   meeting with the AS managers. When the AS databases have been updated, AFCEC/CXX
   will adjust the logistics details (LOGDET) in the LOGFORs to match the newly approved
   ESLs and update ACES PR by the designated change implementation date. ESL changes
   should be made in time to influence annual budget submittals.
   A4.2.4. Mission critical and safety issues will not be held until the next scheduled ESL
   review. They will be resolved immediately. AFCEC/CXX functional managers will
   immediately coordinate and resolve these requirements out-of-cycle with AFCEC/CX,
   MAJCOMs, ANG and the EESPG.
AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013                                                             101


   A4.2.5. Owning MAJCOMs will complete this process for MAJCOM-unique UTC
   requirements. To incorporate those requirements into the ACES PR database, the owning
   MAJCOM must provide complete ESL data on those UTCs to AFCEC/CXX. The owning
   MAJCOM determines the frequency of review for their unique UTCs.
   A4.2.6. Issues related to UTC manpower changes will be worked on a case-by-case basis.
   The OPR will be determined by the situation. All change requirements will be coordinated
   with MAJCOMs, ANG, AFCEC/CX/CXX and AF/A7CX.
A4.3. Documents and Databases. The CE community uses four different documents/databases
to define the equipment and supply requirement for our UTCs, to give the authorization for
accountable equipment items, to provide the LOGDET for deployment, and to manage the assets.
All four documents/databases are required because each serves a specific purpose. The common
data shared by each must be identical to minimize (and hopefully eliminate) problems units have
experienced when deploying assets.
   A4.3.1. The ESL is a CE-unique document/database that is “THE SOURCE” for all CE
   UTC requirements. It is the only source for the details on how to report UTC equipment and
   supply items in the Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS). It is also the source
   for data input into ACES PR. It will also be the source for common key data when the
   interface between ACES PR and the logistics module is established.
   A4.3.2. ASs provide the “authorizations” for units to acquire the accountable equipment
   items that are listed in the ESL. Units must have use code “A” items.
   A4.3.3. The LOGFOR packaging system contains the LOGDET for deploying the
   equipment and supplies and the people assigned to each UTC. AFCEC/CXX has been
   assigned as the pilot unit and MEFPAK responsible command for all standard CE Prime
   BEEF and RED HORSE UTCs and will ensure the LOGFOR includes all items as listed in
   the latest approved ESL.
   A4.3.4. ACES PR provides the data and the business rules to enable units to manage their
   Prime BEEF and RED HORSE assets, in peacetime and when deployed.
A4.4. Process and Responsibilities. The change management process is detailed in the
following steps:

Figure A4.1. Change Management Process
Step 1–The AFCEC/CX functional manager reviews UTC data (manpower, equipment, and
mission capability statement) for currency. This annual check is performed to catch mission
needs, newly fielded equipment, and to update perishable data.

Step 2–The AFCEC/CX functional manager advises MAJCOM and ANG functional managers
of proposed functional review and dates.

Step 3–MAJCOM and ANG functional managers solicit issues/recommendations from units.

Step 4–The AFCEC/CXX functional manager conducts functional reviews with MAJCOM and
ANG representatives, and functional experts. Participants will perform a detailed review of all
line items and update all data elements in the ESL for each UTC. The working group will
 102                                                AFPAM10-219,Volume 8 7 MARCH 2013


provide a recommended date to implement any approved or recommended changes. The
working group will also recommend when to begin SORTS reporting on equipment items that
will be fielded in the future, incrementally, or both. Usually these reviews require considerable
interaction among the participants. However, if there are very limited issues, the review can be
conducted without meeting face-to-face.

Step 5–AFCEC/CXX will document the decisions/recommendations of the working groups and
provide the details to the MAJCOMs and ANG. MAJCOMs and ANG should review the
changes and raise any concerns immediately. AFCEC/CXX will resolve a MAJCOM/ANG
raised issue or will elevate the issue to the appropriate Panel and, if necessary, to the EESPG.

Step 6–AFCEC/CXX and MAJCOM/ANG functional managers put out budget guidance as
appropriate.

Step 7–AFCEC/CXX will host the ESL/AS reconciliation meeting with the AS managers.

Step 8–The AFCEC/CXX ESL data manager will update the ESL database, post the new data,
and send the data to the MAJCOMs and ANG along with the designated change implementation
date.

Step 9–AFCEC/CXX will update the LOGDETs for UTCs that have approved changes.
AFCEC/CXX will ensure that adjustments to the LOGDET for Prime BEEF UTCs are based on
approved changes to the CE ESL and occur no later than 60 days after ASs have been updated.
Per AFI 10-401, AFCEC/CXX will coordinate proposed changes to LOGDETs with non-pilot
units. This coordination is necessary to alert non-pilot units to the pending changes in the
LOGFOR. Non-pilot units had the opportunity to influence requirements in Step 3.

Step 10–The AFCEC/CXX ESL data manager will update ACES PR.

Step 11–MAJCOMs and ANG units prepare budget inputs.
