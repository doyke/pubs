AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury, 18 November 2002 is supplemented as follows: This
supplement describes procedures designed to protect Osan Air Base (AB) personnel from the
adverse health effects from thermal stress and provides unit commanders and supervisors with
information and guidance to operate continuously in either severe hot or cold environments. It is
to be applied in peacetime, contingency, and exercise operations. It applies to all personnel
assigned, attached, or associated with the 51st Fighter Wing (51 FW). Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
supplement supersedes 51FWI 48-109, Prevention of Thermal Stress Injuries, 21 February 2007.
Revisions include clarification of Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)/heat stress monitoring
time frames, training documentation requirements, prioritization of cold weather gear issuance,
added condition Black to Table A4.1.1, allows critical hard-work operations to occur during black

flag, removed temperature ranges from Table A5.2.1, since they conflicted with information in
Table A5.1.1, and minor grammar corrections.

4.11. (Added) Controlling Heat Stress:

4.11.1. (Added) Follow the work/rest cycles as specified in attachment 5 of this supplement.

4.11.2. (Added) Provide drinking water convenient to work area during times where heat stress
category is white or greater. Drinking water should also be made available to the workers while
the worker is exposed to artificially generated heat (i.e. welding, firefighting, etc.). Water should
be kept reasonably cool, but not cold. Reference attachment 5 for recommended water intake.

4.11.3. (Added) Light, loose clothing made of breathable material should be worn during outdoor
activities in hot conditions. If special clothing is required for performing a particular job and it
impedes sweat evaporation or has a high insulation value (e.g. firefighters‟ bunker gear, Mission-
Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) gear, etc.), the workers‟ heat tolerance is reduced.

4.12. (Added) Controlling Cold Stress:

4.12.1. (Added) Follow the work/warming cycles specified in attachment 4 of this supplement.

4.12.2. (Added) During the cold season, or when the worker is exposed to artificially-generated
cold stresses (e.g. freezer lockers, temperature controlled environments, etc.), cold weather gear
should be made available to the worker. If cold weather gear is not available in sufficient
quantities to supply them to all personnel, priority should be given to those performing duties
outdoors or in artificially-generated cold environments.

4.12.3. (Added) Personnel working in cold environments should wear layered clothing, avoid
heavy sweating, and change out of wet clothing immediately.

7.1.1.4. (Added) Ensure WBGT monitoring is completed from 1 May through 30 October unless
weather patterns warrant adjustment. When WBGT reaches/exceeds 78°F (or 25ºC), notify 51 FW
Command Center (51 FW/OC, 784-7000), 51 FW Public Affairs (51 FW/PA, 784-4044), and 51
OSS Weather Flight (51 OSS/OSW, 784-9370) with current WBGT index and heat stress
conditions (attachment 5). When heat stress condition changes, BE will notify the 51 FW/OC, 51
FW/PA, and 51 OSS Weather Fight of the change.

7.1.1.5. (Added) BE will operate manual and digital WBGT simultaneously to ensure heat stress
readings are obtained in case of power outage.

7.1.1.6. (Added) BE personnel will create Wind Chill Index zones of risk and the associated
colored categories IAW paragraph 3.4. of AFPAM 48-151, (attachment 5).

7.1.2. (Added) Public Health Flight (51 AMDS/SGPM) will provide assistance in educating
workers on the adverse health effects of heat/cold stress upon request.

7.1.3. (Added) 51 FW/OC will:

7.1.3.1. (Added) Notify 51 FW/CC, 51 FW/CV, group commanders, SODO, COMM MX
CTRL, CE Desk, LE Desk, 607 SPTS, and the Base Fitness Center of all appropriate heat/cold
stress categories. These members will inform their flights of the heat/cold stress category.

7.1.3.2. (Added) Update heat/cold stress categories on the Commander‟s Channel as needed
during off-duty hours (1700 – 2100), including weekends (0900 – 2100).

7.1.4. (Added) 51 FW/PA will update the heat/cold stress categories on the Commander‟s
Channel as needed during normal duty hours (0900 – 1700).

7.1.5. (Added) 51 OSS/OSW will:

7.1.5.1. (Added) Update observed and forecast temperatures and wind speeds on Base Weather
Channel.

7.1.5.2. (Added) Update heat/cold stress categories on the Weather Channel as needed during
regularly scheduled weekdays.

7.1.5.3. (Added) Be available 24 hours/day to answer any weather related questions.

7.1.6. (Added) Supervisors will:

7.1.6.1. (Added) Follow heat stress control measures and monitor for heat stress signs and
symptoms as listed in paragraph 4.5.

7.1.6.2. (Added) Follow cold stress control measures and monitor for cold stress signs and
symptoms as listed in paragraph 5.5.

7.1.6.3. (Added) Ensure workers are trained on heat/cold stress symptoms and prevention, and
document the training in AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record or electronic
equivalent.

7.1.6.4. (Added) Ensure proper facilities are available for rest periods such as air conditioning in
hot environments and heating in cold environments.

7.2. (Added) 51 FW Exercises

7.2.1. (Added) The 51 FW Commander or Vice Commander can cancel MOPP exercises or
suspend work based on existing heat stress conditions. The 51st Medical Group
Commander and Bioenvironmental Engineers will be available for consultation in that
decision-making process.

7.2.2. (Added) Bioenvironmental Engineering (in EOC) will use Table A2.1, Wet Bulb Globe
Thermometer (WBGT) Index Reference Values, to calculate and recommend work-rest periods
while in MOPP conditions.

7.3. (Added) Guidelines for Personnel Wearing the Ground Crew Chemical Defense
Ensemble

7.3.1. (Added) Personnel performing ground crew operations and training while wearing the
charcoal-impregnated over garment and associated protective equipment of the chemical defense
ensemble are at increased risk of injury from heat stress. Maximum work times tolerated by
personnel while they are wearing the protective ensemble are affected by factors such as an
individual's physical condition, state of thermal acclimatization, and degree of hydration; the
work load associated with a given task; and environmental factors, including air velocity, radiant
heat (sunlight), air temperature, and humidity. The WBGT criteria incorporate many of these
variables.

7.3.2.2. (Added) MOPP 2 only -- add 5 degrees to the WBGT.

7.3.2.3. (Added) MOPP 2 and IPE gear worn -- add 10 degrees to the WBGT.

7.3.2.4. (Added) MOPP 3 or 4 only -- add 10 degrees to the WBGT.

7.3.2.5. (Added) MOPP 3 or 4 and IPE gear worn -- add 15 degrees to the WBGT.

7.3.3. (Added) Make the following adjustments to the WBGT index based on MOPP variations
(figures are based on estimates and professional judgment):

7.3.3.1. (Added) MOPP 2 ventilated -- subtract 2 degrees from the adjusted WBGT.

7.3.3.2. (Added) No BDU option -- subtract 3 degrees from the adjusted WBGT.

7.3.3.3. (Added) No BDU and ventilated -- subtract 4 degrees from the adjusted WBGT.
