Terms
Category I Container— LONG LIFE: This category is designed to function effectively for a
minimum of 100 trips through the transportation system. These containers are usually made out
of metal, hard plastic, synthetic or composite materials. The design is according to an
engineering drawing and the container is produced by the industry. Reproduction of these
containers is beyond the capability of the base packing and crating function at the cargo
movement center. Note: The interior packaging materials and devices are as important as the
container itself. It is designed to be used, saved and reused as a complete system.
Category II Container— SHORT LIFE: These containers are designed to survive a minimum
of 10 trips through the transportation system. They are usually made out of plywood, wood or
fiberboard and can be identified by military or federal specification numbers. The internal
system of cushioning, die cuts, inserts, fasteners, as well as the container, are described by a
drawing and bill of material called SPI. In most cases, base-level packaging personnel are able
to repair, produce or refurbish this type of container. Category II containers are listed under
stock class 8115 and consist of three types as described below:
Container— Any receptacle used to enclose and afford maximum protection to government
property for storage and shipment.
Reusable Container— A specially designed container which is engineered for repeated use
without impairment of its protective function.
Type 1— FAST PACKS: These boxes are normally made out of cardboard with a pre-
determined interior cushioning design, i.e., star, slide, telescopic, horizontal star, etc. They are
available in various sizes and can be found in the Federal Supply Catalog C-815-ML-AF and the
Federal Supply Service Catalog. They are also known as the X series packs (XA, XC, XE…).
Fast packs are especially cost effective, due to small storage space required, high reuse value and
low labor cost for packaging.
Type 2— STANDARD PACKS: Interior components are standardized to meet the size of
particular items. There are about 100 different sizes listed. The cushioning in the standard pack
varies according to coded requirements for packaging of that particular item.
Type 3— SPECIAL PACKAGING INSTRUCTION: The SPI is a container with internal
components designed for a specific item or group of items of the same size or shape. They are
identified by a national item identification number (NIIN), i.e., SPI 055-1413. No other items
will fit into these containers without major modifications to the container and its internal
components. These containers should also have the words REUSABLE CONTAINER DO NOT
DESTROY stenciled on the outside.
