SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is a reissue of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 65-508, dated 1 October 1997. It
updates the policy, responsibilities, functions, and relationships associated with Air Force cost
estimating. It incorporates major revisions resulting from the reissue of AFPD 65-5 Cost and
Economics (5 August 2008) and DoDI 5000.02 (2 Dec 2008), and the issue of the Weapon
Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) (Public Law 111-23). It also includes revisions to
comply with OSD Director, Acquisition Resources and Analysis (ARA) and Chair, Office of the
Secretary of Defense Cost Analysis Improvement Group (OSD CAIG) memorandum dated 12
March 2009, subject Required Signed and Documented Component-level Cost Position for
Milestone Reviews.

This instruction implements a significant change in Air Force cost estimating requirements. The
primary change moves the Air Force from focusing on developing cost estimates at acquisition
milestones into a comprehensive structure requiring annual cost estimates for all Acquisition
Category (ACAT) I, II, and III programs. This change ensures that credible and timely estimates
are available to inform a broader spectrum of Air Force decision making, in particular,
improving and integrating day to day program management decisions, Department of Defense
(DoD) Acquisition processes for Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs), and the
Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) system. This instruction describes
the different types of Air Force cost estimates, the process used to develop cost estimates, and
the content and documentation requirements associated with cost estimates, emphasizing
collaboration between program office, product/logistics center FMC, and Air Force Cost
Analysis Agency (AFCAA) cost estimators. The overarching goal is the production of more
realistic, objective cost estimates increasing the fidelity, realism, and credibility associated with
Air Force budgets and program baselines, and ultimately reducing cost overruns on Air Force
acquisition programs.

                                           Chapter 1

                              AIR FORCE COST ESTIMATES

1.1. Types.
     1.1.1. The Air Force primarily develops four types of cost estimates: Program Office
     Estimates (POEs), Non Advocate Cost Assessments (NACAs), Service Cost Positions
     (SCPs) and Independent Cost Estimates (ICEs).
        1.1.1.1. Program Office Estimates (POEs) [also referred to as Program Cost Estimates
        (PCEs) in AFPD 65-5].]
           1.1.1.1.1. POEs are either developed by the Program Office or are the result of a
           collaborative effort between the Program Office, the product/logistics center financial
           management cost organization (FMC) and/or the AFCAA.
           1.1.1.1.2. POEs are updated annually for all ACAT I, II and III programs.
           Thresholds for ACATs are defined in Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI)
           5000.02 Operation of the Defense Acquisition System.
           1.1.1.1.3. The product/logistics center FMC must concur on all annual ACAT I, II
           and III POEs. This may be accomplished through collaborative development of the
           POE -- product/logistics center FMC and the Program Office -- or through a
           product/logistics center FMC review of the POE.
           1.1.1.1.4. Program cost estimates are vital to providing leadership with critical
           information for program decisions, establishing executable budgets, and proactively
           addressing financial issues. POEs support all Milestone decisions [A, B, C, and Full
           Rate Production (FRP) or Full Deployment Decision Reviews (FDDRs)], PPBE
           formulation, source selections, and program breach and/or program change decisions.
        1.1.1.2. Non Advocate Cost Assessments (NACAs)
           1.1.1.2.1. NACAs are an analysis of program cost/price, schedule, and technical risk,
           prepared by an organization not directly responsible for the development, acquisition,
           or support of the program. NACAs are primarily designed to support both the Air
           Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) and acquisition milestone decision processes, and
           can range from a simple sufficiency review of an existing estimate to a complete ICE.
           1.1.1.2.2. NACAs are developed by the AFCAA, unless delegated to another
           organization by the AFCAA Executive Director.
           1.1.1.2.3. NACAs are updated annually for all ACAT I programs and select ACAT
           II/III programs. SAF/FM and/or SAF/AQ are responsible for selecting ACAT II and
           III programs that require a NACA.
           1.1.1.2.4. NACAs support Milestone decisions (A, B, C and FRP or FDDRs), PPBE
           formulation, source selections, and program breach/program change decisions.
           1.1.1.2.5. NACAs are approved by the responsible AFCAA Division Chief and, at a
           minimum, submitted to the AFCAA Executive Director, Program Manager, Program
AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012                                                                       5


        Executive Officer (PEO), MAJCOM functional Point of Contact, SAF/AQ Program
        Element Monitor (PEM), and the Panel Chair.
     1.1.1.3. Service Cost Position (SCP)
        1.1.1.3.1. The SCP represents the Air Force’s official cost estimate. For ACAT I and
        select ACAT II/III programs, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) of the Air Force
        for Cost and Economics (SAF/FMC) approves and recommends an SCP for
        consideration by the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE). The SAE typically accepts
        the recommended SCP, but may designate an alternative position as the official SCP.
        1.1.1.3.2. A memorandum from OSD Director, ARA and Chair, OSD CAIG dated 12
        March 2009, ―Required Signed and Documented Component-level Cost Position for
        Milestone Reviews,‖ requires:
            1.1.1.3.2.1. A component cost position signed by the service cost director
            (SAF/FMC), and a full-funding memorandum signed by both the service
            comptroller (SAF/FM) and service acquisition executive (SAF/AQ).
            Accordingly, for all MDAP and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS)
            programs:
               1.1.1.3.2.1.1. SAF/FMC must provide the Office of the Secretary of Defense
               Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation [OSD (CAPE)] a memorandum
               documenting the recommended SCP.
               1.1.1.3.2.1.2. SAF/FM and SAF/AQ must provide a memorandum, with
               AF/A8 concurrence, certifying the program is fully funded to the SCP. This
               full-funding memorandum includes the SAF/FMC recommended SCP
               memorandum as an attachment. If the SAE chooses a cost position different
               from the SAF/FMC recommended SCP, this memorandum must also
               document the official SCP.
        1.1.1.3.3. Typically, the recommended SCP is developed through the Air Force Cost
        Analysis Improvement Group (AFCAIG) process, as described in Chapter 2 of this
        instruction. This process is designed to be collaborative, combining the input of all
        stakeholder cost organizations and a broad range of functional input.              A
        recommended SCP may also be developed through an alternative process, as
        described in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
        1.1.1.3.4. Recommended SCPs shall be established for all Milestone (A, B, C and
        FRP or FDDR) decisions for ACAT IC, ID, IAM, and IAC programs (as well as pre-
        MDAPs expected to be designated ACAT Is). Recommended SCPs should also be
        established or updated whenever a program Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) is
        established or updated.
        1.1.1.3.5. Joint programs typically develop Joint Cost Positions (JCPs) for milestone
        decisions using the processes employed by the lead service.
            1.1.1.3.5.1. Joint programs where the Air Force is the lead service follow Air
            Force cost policy and processes for all elements of the program (Chapter 2 of this
            instruction). In these cases, Air Force cost organizations provide cost estimates
            for all common Program Elements (PEs) and Air Force unique elements. Other
 6                                                                        AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012


               services/components’ unique elements are typically estimated by their
               representative cost organizations and reviewed through the Air Force cost
               processes.
               1.1.1.3.5.2. Joint programs where the Air Force is not the lead service follow the
               cost processes of the lead service for all common elements of the program. Air
               Force unique elements require cost estimates and cost reviews per Air Force
               policy and processes (see Chapter 2 of this instruction).
        1.1.1.4. Independent Cost Estimates (ICEs)
            1.1.1.4.1. The OSD (CAPE) has the responsibility to develop the ICE required by
            statute for ACAT ID and IAM programs. For ACAT IC programs, DoDI 5000.02
            delegates responsibility for statutorily required ICEs to the respective service cost
            centers. Across the Air Force, the AFCAA is the responsible authority for delegated
            ICEs. The AFCAA also provides ICEs at the direction of the Under Secretary of
            Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics [USD (AT&L)], OSD (CAPE),
            SAF/AQ, or SAF/FM.
            1.1.1.4.2. Two statutes provide direction regarding when ICEs are required.
               1.1.1.4.2.1. 10 United States Code (USC), Sec. 2434 requires an ICE for ACAT I
               programs prior to initiating development [Milestone (MS) B] and production (MS
               C).
               1.1.1.4.2.2. Public Law 111-23, requires MDAP and MAIS ICEs be
               accomplished by OSD (CAPE) for all programs where USD (AT&L) is the
               milestone decision authority in advance of (1) 10 USC, Sec. 2366a and 2366b
               required certifications (MDAP MS A and MS B decision points), (2) Low Rate
               Initial Production (LRIP) and FRP decisions, and (3) other certifications and
               reports required under 10 USC, Sec. 2433a (i.e, MDAP unit cost breaches, also
               known as Nunn-McCurdy breaches) and 10 USC, Sec. 2445c(f) (i.e.,
               significant/critical changes for MAIS programs).
1.2. Requirements.
     1.2.1. Cost estimates (POEs, NACAs, SCPs, ICEs, etc.) should typically encompass total
     program life cycle costs. Total program life cycle costs include ―sunk costs‖ incurred from
     program initiation (usually Milestone A program approval) through disposal, to include all
     costs associated with a decision to proceed with the program. Life Cycle Cost Estimates
     (LCCEs) should include:
        1.2.1.1. All investment (development and production) and Operations and Support
        (O&S) costs.
            1.2.1.1.1. Costs funded by all applicable appropriations including Research
            Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), procurement, Military Construction
            (MILCON), Operations and Maintenance (O&M), and Military Personnel
            (MILPERS), regardless of funding source or management control (ref. 10 USC, Sec
            2434).
               1.2.1.1.1.1. Include all sustainment and disposal costs.
AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012                                                                            7


             1.2.1.1.1.2. Include all applicable Restoration and Modernization (R&M) costs
             associated with facility and infrastructure sustainment, MILCON and O&M
             appropriation funds.
             1.2.1.1.1.3. Include all contractor and government costs.
     1.2.1.2. Resources associated with all of the applicable work breakdown structure
     elements (reference MIL-STD 881C for the typical WBS elements).
     1.2.1.3. All indirect elements, particularly those associated with sustainment, or O&S
     costs, in order to ensure the capture of all relevant total ownership costs. Indirect costs
     associated with sustainment must meet requirements outlined in the OSD CAIG [now
     OSD (CAPE)] O&S Cost Estimating Guide.
     1.2.1.4. Costs displayed by program phase, consistent with acquisition program phases
     defined in DoDI 5000.02.
     1.2.1.5. A comprehensive risk/uncertainty analysis. ACAT I and II program cost
     estimates should typically not be established at a Confidence Level (CL) lower than the
     mean of the program cost estimate distribution (typically 55-65% CL) or, where a
     distribution cannot be computed, the average, or expected value of the cost estimate. For
     more information on cost estimating confidence levels and cost risk/uncertainty analysis,
     reference the April 2007 Air Force Cost Risk and Uncertainty Handbook.
  1.2.2. Cost estimates must be accurate, comprehensive, and address all relevant
  programmatic, technical, and financial issues. Insight into cost drivers and their effect on life
  cycle costs should be provided, and estimates should be structured to be responsive to
  program changes and associated requirements for cost estimate excursions. Cost estimates
  should be fully documented (source data, estimating methods, and results) to the level that a
  qualified cost estimator could recreate the estimate using only the written documentation.
  Chapter 5 of this instruction describes the minimum documentation requirements for cost
  estimates.
  1.2.3. All cost estimates for ACAT I Programs (MDAP and MAIS) must be led by a
  properly qualified member of the Armed Forces or full time employee of the DoD.
     1.2.3.1. A properly qualified lead cost estimator is defined as a professional cost
     estimator that is Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Level III certified in the field of
     Business-Cost Estimating (BUS-CE).
     1.2.3.2. The lead cost estimator on MDAP and MAIS programs should be coded as a
     Key Leadership Position (KLP). This policy is consistent with a SAF/AQ memo
     Government Performance of Critical Acquisition Functions, 22 October 2010,
     designating lead cost estimators as KLPs. AFI 63-101 provides Air Force guidance on
     the definition of KLPs.
  1.2.4. Air Force cost estimates support a wide range of activities. Program Office Estimates,
  NACAs, SCPs and ICEs provide key decision support for the PPBE process and daily
  program management activities – affordability, design and budget trades, contract
  negotiations, contract performance measurement, program management reviews,
  requirements trades, etc. They provide the cost, technical and programmatic decision support
  needed to manage programs on a day to day basis. They are used to support multiple forms
8                                                                      AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012


    of comparative analysis and baseline reviews, including Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs),
    Economic Analysis (EA), Business Case Analysis (BCA), make buy decisions, source
    selections, proposal evaluations, and design/cost tradeoff analyses. These cost estimates also
    support key decision points like MDAP milestone reviews, PPBE reviews, AFCS decisions,
    APB development, program unit cost breaches (commonly known as Nunn-McCurdy
    breaches) and critical change notifications. This instruction focuses primarily on the
    requirements and processes associated with the preparation of POEs, NACAs, SCPs and
    ICEs used in support of acquisition program programming, budgeting, and execution
    (including Milestone) decisions. This instruction covers the roles, responsibilities, and
    processes for developing will-cost estimates, and does not provide direction on the
    development of should-cost estimates. In this instruction, will-cost estimates are defined as
    an estimate that aims to provide sufficient resources to execute the program under normal
    conditions, encountering average levels of technical, schedule, and programmatic risk
    (usually no less than mean confidence level, typically between 55-65%). This will-cost
    estimate supports the budget and ensures sufficient funding to provide confidence that: 1) the
    program can be completed without the need for significant adjustment to program budgets,
    and 2) the program can avoid Nunn-McCurdy or critical change breaches. Specific
    requirements and processes for developing cost estimates to support source selections,
    contract negotiation and contract performance measurement, AoAs, and other comparative
    studies can be found in other related instructions.
       1.2.4.1. Annual Estimates
           1.2.4.1.1. POEs for ACAT I, II and III programs and NACAs for ACAT I programs
           and selected ACAT II/III programs shall be updated annually. SAF/FM, with the
           concurrence of SAF/AQ (or their delegated PEO), is responsible for approving annual
           cost estimate waivers for ACAT I POEs and NACAs. The product/logistics center
           cost chief is responsible for approving ACAT II and III POE waivers. The Program
           Manager is responsible for requesting POE waivers and the AFCAA Division Chief is
           responsible for requesting NACA waivers.
               1.2.4.1.1.1. A Program Manager or AFCAA Division Chief must request an
               annual cost estimate waiver if no annual estimate will be produced or updated
               during the calendar year.
               1.2.4.1.1.2. POE waiver requests for ACAT I programs and all NACA waiver
               requests should be submitted to SAF/FMC for final approval, after SAF/AQ (or
               delegated PEO) concurrence.
               1.2.4.1.1.3. POE waiver requests for ACAT II and III programs should be
               submitted to the product/logistics center FMC for final approval, with notification
               sent to SAF/FMC and the MAJCOM FMC.
               1.2.4.1.1.4. Requests for waivers must be submitted by 30 January of the
               calendar year the estimate is due. Waiver requests provided after 30 January will
               be considered for circumstances that could not have been anticipated at the
               beginning of the calendar year. A waiver request template is included in
               Attachment 2 of this instruction. Alternative cover letter/staff summary sheet
               formats are acceptable as long as the information and signatures required in the
               attached template are included.
AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012                                                                          9


            1.2.4.1.1.5. Waiver requests may ask for a permanent exemption from the annual
            estimate requirement using the same process as annual requests. However,
            permanent waivers are typically reserved for programs that have completed
            production and are years into the sustainment phase.
     1.2.4.2. Milestone Estimates
        1.2.4.2.1. The Air Force will develop POEs, NACAs, and SCPs for all ACAT I and
        selected ACAT II/III Milestone reviews [Milestone A, B, C, and Full Rate Production
        Decision (FRPD) or FDDRs].
        1.2.4.2.2. The AFCAA must develop the 10 USC, Sec. 2434 required ICE for ACAT
        IC programs at all Milestone B and C (development and LRIP) decisions.
        1.2.4.2.3. Chapter 2 of this instruction covers the AFCAIG process associated with
        the preparation of Air Force estimates supporting ACAT I program milestone
        decisions.
        1.2.4.2.4. Per DoDI 5000.02, Contractor Cost Data Reports (CCDRs) and Software
        Resources and Data Reports (SRDRs) are required for most pre-MDAP, MDAP, pre-
        MAIS, and MAIS program contracts. CCDR and SRDR plans must be reviewed and
        approved by SAF/FMC prior to being submitted for final OSD CAPE approval.
        AFCAIG briefings performed in support of milestone decisions must include the
        status of CCDR and SRDR plan development, as well as the status for programs with
        CCDRs and SRDRs already on contract.
     1.2.4.3. PPBE Estimates
        1.2.4.3.1. In order to comply with Public Law 111-23 (WSARA), the USD (AT&L),
        OSD Director, ARA, Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller [USD(C)], and OSD
        (CAPE) have instituted the MDAP issue team process. This process entails a review
        of the 10 USC, Sec. 2366a and 2366b certification status of MDAPs during the
        Program Budget Review (PBR) process. This review focuses on verifying MDAPs
        are fully funded to a realistic cost estimate [with OSD (CAPE) concurrence], cost
        estimates are documented and consistent with current program definition, per service
        Program Objective Memorandums (POMs), and programs are not in imminent danger
        of a baseline breach (Nunn-McCurdy unit cost, APB, MAIS program change, etc.).
        This review will usually be conducted every year at three points in the PPBE cycle –
        when the service POM is sent to OSD, after the Resource Management Decisions
        (RMDs) are issued, and immediately before delivering the President’s Budget (PB) to
        Congress. During these reviews, the MDAP issue team expects service cost directors
        to provide documentation on all MDAP cost estimates used to support development
        of the POM. In cases where the MDAP issue team cannot verify that a program is
        fully funded to a realistic cost estimate, the program risks de-certification of 2366a or
        2366b status, and revocation of milestone approval (with possible loss of authority to
        obligate and expend funding).
        1.2.4.3.2. In support of the MDAP Issue Team, SAF/AQ PEMs provide explicit
        information on Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) direction, current budget
        position compared to 10 USC, Sec. 2366a and 2366b certification requirements, Sec.
        2366a and 2366b certification status, and documentation supporting the current cost
10                                                                  AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012


        estimate, with an emphasis on cost estimates/assessments from independent sources
        [such as the AFCAA or the OSD (CAPE)]. The requirement for annual POEs and
        NACAs ensures timely, relevant, and reliable cost estimates are available to support
        the AFCS POM build. All POEs, NACAs, SCPs, and other estimates used to support
        the AF POM build must be documented and provided to the AFCAA, SAF/FMC,
        SAF/AQ PEMs, and AF/A8 for review and likely submission to OSD, in conjunction
        with the AF POM submittal (typically July). The AFCAA is then responsible for
        working with OSD (CAPE) to populate their database of documented cost estimates.
        1.2.4.3.3. As a member of the AFCS, SAF/FMC will work within the corporate
        process to ensure all funding disconnects, revealed by comparing the POE and NACA
        to the budget, are illustrated through a portfolio cost risk assessment provided to the
        AFCS Panels, Group, Board, and eventually, Council.
     1.2.4.4. MDAP Program Breach (significant and critical) and MAIS Program Change
     (significant and critical) Estimates
        1.2.4.4.1. When an SCP, POE, ICE or NACA indicates an MDAP unit cost breach
        (Nunn-McCurdy significant and critical breach) as defined in 10 USC, Sec. 2433, a
        MDAP post Milestone A breach (per Public Law 111-23 modifications to 10 USC,
        Sec. 2633a), or a MAIS program change (significant or critical change) as defined in
        10 USC, Sec. 2445c, the Program Manager shall consider all current cost estimates
        and report the findings to the SAE. The SAE will then report these findings to the
        Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) who will make the final breach or program
        change determination.
        1.2.4.4.2. Before reporting findings to the SAE, the Program Manager determines
        which of the current estimates (e.g., POE, NACA, SCP) will be used as the basis of
        the breach or program change reporting. It is highly recommended that a SAF/FMC
        recommended SCP be used for breach reporting whenever possible. All MDAPs
        undergoing a critical breach [10 USC, Sec. 2433 and Public Law 111-23 (WSARA)]
        certification to Congress require OSD (CAPE) concurrence on the Program
        Acquisition Unit Cost (PAUC) and Acquisition Procurement Unit Cost (APUC)
        estimates. In most cases, OSD (CAPE) will request a SAF/FMC recommended SCP,
        documented through a SAF/FMC signed memorandum, to support their evaluation
        and recommendation to the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). At a minimum, if a
        recommended SCP is unavailable, the PM should expect OSD to request a SAF/FMC
        assessment of the basis of estimate for the ―re-baselined‖ PAUC and APUC estimates
        as part of its determination of reasonableness.
        1.2.4.4.3. Program offices, product/logistic center cost organizations, and the
        AFCAA will normally have a role in fulfilling program analysis and root cause
        analysis requirements outlined in Public Law 111-23 (WSARA). The OSD Program
        Analysis and Root Cause Analysis (PARCA) organization is newly formed and has
        not yet issued guidance in this area. When implementation guidance is provided,
        SAF/FMC will issue necessary policy addendums to this instruction.

                                         Chapter 2

         AIR FORCE COST ANALYSIS IMPROVEMENT GROUP (AFCAIG)

2.1. Purpose.
   2.1.1. This chapter provides guidance on the AFCAIG process used in Defense Acquisition
   Executive (DAE), SAE, and other milestone reviews, to include guidance for developing the
   SCP and obtaining AFCAIG approval of the SCP.
   2.1.2. All ACAT I programs (including ACAT ID, IC, IAM and IAC programs) engaged in
   a milestone decision must follow this process. In addition, programs requiring an SCP to
   support the PPBE or other key decision points should also follow this process.
   2.1.3. ACAT II, III, and non-ACAT programs may follow the AFCAIG process at the
   discretion of the SAE (typically SAF/AQ, or delegated to the PEO) or SAF/FM.
   2.1.4. Additionally, Air Force product/logistic centers are highly encouraged to implement a
   modified version of this process, with center cost staff assuming AFCAA responsibilities.
2.2. AFCAIG Background.
   2.2.1. The AFCAIG process was developed to meet the requirements of DoD 5000
   regulations and Title 10, United States Code.
      2.2.1.1. The AFCAIG was established by the SECAF and is chaired by the Deputy
      Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Cost and Economics. AFCAIG membership
      includes key stakeholders from various Air Force Secretariat and Headquarters United
      States Air Force (HQ USAF) functional offices (see paragraph 2.3.2). The AFCAIG
      reviews cost estimates and advises the chair on the recommended SCP, which is in turn
      provided to the SAE who establishes the official SCP in support of the milestone or other
      acquisition decision.
      2.2.1.2. For MDAP and MAIS programs entering MS A, B, C and FRPD or FDDR,
      SAF/FMC must also provide OSD (CAPE) a memorandum documenting the
      recommended SCP. SAF/FM and the SAE (typically the SAF/AQ), with AF/A8
      concurrence, must provide a full-funding memorandum certifying the program is fully
      funded to the official SAE endorsed SCP. This full-funding memorandum includes the
      SAF/FMC recommended SCP memorandum as an attachment. If the SAE chooses an
      official SCP that is different than the recommended SCP, the full-funding memorandum
      should document this position.
2.3. AFCAIG Process.
   2.3.1. The AFCAIG process consists of three phases, 1) Cost Integrated Product Team
   (CIPT) kick-off, 2) SCP development via the Cost Working Group (CWG), and 3)
   recommended SCP briefing and documentation.

      2.3.1.1. For ACAT IC programs, an ICE must be developed independently by the
      AFCAA. While program office personnel do not directly participate in producing the
      ICE, collaborative interaction between the program office and ICE teams is required to
      maximize the exchange of accurate information.
  2.3.2. CIPT Kick-Off Phase
      2.3.2.1. An AFCAA representative serves as the CIPT lead, unless delegated by
      SAF/FMC.       The CIPT membership typically includes senior leaders from the
      organizations listed in Table 2.1.
 14                                                                    AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012

      2.3.2.2. This phase establishes the plan to produce a reliable SCP in support of the
      milestone or other acquisition decision. Decision forums include, but are not limited to,
      the Air Force Review Board (AFRB), the Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT),
      the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), or other service/defense acquisition executive
      reviews.
      2.3.2.3. The CIPT conducts a meeting as early as feasible, at least 30 – 50 days prior to
      the draft Cost Analysis Requirements Description (CARD) due date. The CARD
      provides a description of the salient features of the acquisition program. Chapter 4
      provides a more in depth description of the CARD. A draft CARD is due 180 days prior
      to the OIPT.
         2.3.2.3.1. This first meeting determines the extent of the effort required to support
         the AFCAIG review process, develops a preliminary schedule, and collects available
         program information (i.e., current CARD, preliminary POE, program schedule,
         identification of high cost and high risk areas, technical and programmatic
         information, etc.). Participation by Program Office and other technical subject matter
         experts is recommended to help identify program high cost and high risk areas, and
         key technical and schedule assumptions.
         2.3.2.3.2. The kick-off meeting should emphasize efforts to develop the plan to
         integrate the efforts of the CWG and Program Support Review (PSR) or PSR-like
         teams.
             2.3.2.3.2.1. Per DoDI 5000.02, PSRs are a means to inform a Milestone Decision
             Authority (MDA) and program office of the status of the technical planning and
             management processes by identifying cost, schedule, and performance risks along
             with recommendations to mitigate those risks. PSRs are conducted by cross-
             functional and cross-organizational teams appropriate to the program and
             situation. PSRs are led by the Director, Systems and Software Engineering (SSE)
             and required for all OIPTs.
             2.3.2.3.2.2. Best practice reports routinely tout the value of significant interaction
             between cost estimating and PSR or PSR-like review teams. In particular, close
             interaction ensures program risks are appropriately captured in the cost estimates
AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012                                                                                        15


                    and clearly articulated in PSR reports presented to the AFRB and OIPT.
            2.3.2.3.3. Tables 2. 2 and 2.3 provide notional AFCAIG timelines for ACAT I
            programs. These timelines facilitate a successful AFCAIG review process through
            early identification and analysis of available data, and ensure that an acceptable,
            ―costable‖ draft CARD is prepared in a timely manner.

  * For ACAT IC and all programs where the Air Force is the MDA, use the AFRB as
  the date of reference vice the OIPT. With the exception of ACAT IC MS A and MS B
  decisions, there is no requirement for an official OSD (CAPE) review. For ACAT IC
  MS A and MS B decisions, Public Law 111 -23 (WSARA) requires OSD (CAPE)
  concurrence on any cost estimates used for 10 USC Sec. 2366a or 2366b
  certifications, even when the service is the delegated MDA. OSD (CAPE) has not yet
  issued specific guidance on a process or timeline to achieve concurrence on for ACAT
  IC programs. Therefore, each CIPT lead must work with the OSD (CAPE) to develop
  an AF and OSD agreed-upon documented timeline and process to gain OSD (CAPE)
  concurrence on the final SCP, prior to Air Force Acquisition Executive Milestone A
  and B decisions. Without specific OSD (CAPE) guidance, at a minimum, plan to
  provide the signed SAF/FMC recommended SCP and signed AQ/FM full -funding
  memorandum to the OSD (CAPE) NLT 45 days prior the AFRB for MS A and B
  decisions on ACAT IC programs.

                2.3.2.3.4. If the program has updated their POE and NACA annually, as required by
                AFPD 65-5, then the estimating phase may be condensed.
       2.3.2.4. At the CIPT kick off meeting, the CWG is formed. The CWG is a subset of the
       CIPT and comprised of cost estimators from the organizations listed in Table 2.4.
AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012                                                                       17

      2.3.2.5. A recommended SCP is developed collaboratively by the Program Office and
      AFCAA. Collaboration can take many forms, from separate ICE and program office
      teams to a single combined AFCAA and program office estimating team. Typically, a
      more balanced approach is taken where the AFCAA performs a tailored NACA focused
      on the high cost and high risk areas. The CIPT kick-off meeting should discuss plans and
      expectations for CWG collaboration, with the understanding that the degree of
      collaboration could change as the cost estimate process matures. For cases where the
      AFCAA is performing an ICE required by statute, no program office personnel or center
      cost estimators may participate directly on the ICE team.
   2.3.3. Cost Working Group (CWG) SCP Development Phase
      2.3.3.1. The CWG will begin working the cost estimates after the CIPT kick-off meeting.
      Typically, the CWG has two main components: the program office estimating team and
      the AFCAA estimating team. When practical, the OSD (CAPE) analyst should be invited
      to attend and participate in CWG meetings.
      2.3.3.2. The CWG SCP development phase starts no later than when the draft CARD is
      delivered (NLT 180 days prior to the OIPT). At this time, outstanding CWG issues and
      concerns should be discussed (estimating plan and schedule, cost and technical
      requirements, subject matter expert support, independent schedule assessments, etc.).
      When possible, the Program Office should provide a program overview and status
      review, and POE briefings that include the program/system description, requirements list,
      proposed schedules, baseline program/technical overview, acquisition strategy, buy
      quantities, and a comparison between the current POE and approved program budget, by
      appropriation.
      2.3.3.3. As elements of both the POE and NACA/ICE are finished, they should be shared
      with the CWG. The CWG should plan to have regular estimating methods reconciliation
      meetings. The CWG then decides what methods are most applicable for the draft,
      recommended SCP. The premise behind reconciliations is not compromise; it is a
      consensus-building exercise between professional counterparts.
      2.3.3.4. The POE and NACA/ICE teams must ensure that technical, schedule and cost
      data and models are shared, that any issues are resolved in a timely manner, and that
      differences between the cost estimates are fully understood by all relevant parties. As
      needed, additional CWG and CIPT meetings are held to collect information, identify and
      resolve issues, modify schedules, and make incremental decisions about the
      recommended SCP. The CIPT leads prepare meeting agendas, minutes, and interfaces
18                                                                 AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012


     with other Air Force, OSD and other services offices. As issues are raised, every effort
     should be made to resolve them at the CWG or CIPT level. Issues not resolved at the
     CWG or CIPT level are communicated by the CIPT lead to the AFCAIG Chair for
     resolution. This can be done at any time during the SCP Development Phase.
  2.3.4. Recommended SCP Briefing and Documentation Phase
     2.3.4.1. The AFCAIG meeting is held 55 days prior to the OIPT (or AFRB if the Air
     Force is delegated MDA). Upon completion of the AFCAIG meeting, the AFCAA will
     brief the recommended SCP to the AFRB. Therefore, even in cases where there is an
     OIPT, the AFCAIG must be held in time to allow for presentation of the recommended
     SCP at the AFRB.
     2.3.4.2. During the AFCAIG meeting, the Program Manager or his designee will brief a
     program overview. If a single estimate has been developed, the CIPT lead will brief this
     estimate as the draft recommended SCP. Where both a POE and a NACA have been
     accomplished, the CIPT lead briefs the AFCAIG on the pre-reconciliation methods and
     estimates for both the POE and NACA. The briefing should also include changes
     resulting from the reconciliation process and open discussion on any unresolved issues or
     special interest items. After the AFCAIG meeting and successful resolution of issues,
     SAF/FMC approves a recommended SCP. This recommended SCP is presented to the
     SAE (SAF/AQ) for approval through an AFCAA brief to the AFRB and/or a SAF/FMC
     signed memorandum to the SAE.
     2.3.4.3. Upon completion of the AFCAIG meeting, and no later than 52 days prior to the
     OIPT, the AFCAIG chair (SAF/FMC) must sign a memorandum documenting the
     recommended Service Cost Position. This memorandum should be provided it to
     SAF/AQ, SAF/FM, and the OSD (CAPE). Typically, the memorandum will include an
     attached AFCAIG report providing more detailed information on the cost estimate,
     including key assumptions, methods, phasing, and cost risks/uncertainty analysis. The
     detailed AFCAIG report attachment is mandatory for ACAT IC and ID programs
     requiring OSD (CAPE) concurrence for 10 USC, Sec. 2366a and 2366b certification at
     Milestones A and B.
     2.3.4.4. Currently, OSD requires a full-funding memorandum signed by SAF/FM (as the
     Chief Financial Officer) and SAF/AQ (as the Acquisition Executive), coordinated
     through AF/A8, certifying the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) fully funds the
     program consistent with a SAF/FMC signed recommended SCP. Both the SCP and full-
     funding memorandums are required for all MDAPs seeking milestone A, B, C and
     FRP/FDDR approval. In addition, USD (AT&L) and OSD (CAPE) now require all
     ACAT IAM (MAIS) programs provide both an SCP and full-funding memorandums in
     support of major milestone reviews. [Currently, the only formal guidance on this topic is
     provided via a 12 March 2010 OSD Director, ARA and OSD Cost Analysis Improvement
     Group [now OSD (CAPE)] memorandum, subject ―Required Signed and Documented
     Component-level Cost Position for Milestone Reviews.‖             However, this OSD
     memorandum directs that these new requirements to be incorporated in the next update of
     DOD 5000.4-M. Therefore, when establishing the plan of action, CIPT/CWG teams
     supporting MDAP and MAIS programs seeking milestone or FRP/FDDR approval
AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012                                                                      19


     should review the latest release of DoD 5000.4-M, as well as any new USD (AT&L) and
     OSD (CAPE) guidance memorandums on this subject.]
     2.3.4.5. After completing the AFCAIG briefing cycle and gaining SAF/AQ approval of
     the recommended SCP, the SCP is formally presented to the appropriate OSD
     organization. Ideally, prior to this formal presentation of the SCP, multiple meetings at
     the CWG level have taken place where information on the final SCP and the OSD
     (CAPE) estimates have been fully shared. Formal presentation of the SCP should occur
     no later than 21 days prior to the OIPT or component review meeting. This presentation
     should include a program office provided program overview and a CIPT led presentation
     of the recommended SCP.
     2.3.4.6. The CWG should provide the final version of its cost estimate documentation in
     accordance with DoD 5000.4 and Chapter 5 of this instruction NLT 10 days prior to the
     OIPT (or Air Force Review Board).
     2.3.4.7. The AFCAA will keep a repository with templates for use in preparing AFCAIG
     and OSD (CAPE) briefing charts, recommended SCP memorandums, AFCAIG reports,
     and full funding memorandums. This repository will also include best practice examples
     of the CARD, cost estimate documentation, etc., and be available to all government
     employees upon request.
  2.3.5. AFCAIG Membership – The AFCAIG, at a minimum, includes members from the
  following organizations:
     2.3.5.1. SAF/FMC – Deputy Assistant Secretary (Cost and Economics), Chairperson
     2.3.5.2. SAF/AQX – Acquisition Program Integration
     2.3.5.3. SAF/FMBI – Director of Budget Investment
     2.3.5.4. AF/A7C – Civil Engineering

                                         Chapter 3

SERVICE COST POSITION (SCP) GENERATED OUTSIDE THE AFCAIG PROCESS

3.1. Purpose.
   3.1.1. This chapter provides further guidance on the development of a recommended SCP
   outside the normal AFCAIG process.
      3.1.1.1. The AFCAIG process, described in Chapter 2 of this instruction, is the primary
      process for developing the recommended SCP. This process is mandatory when
      preparing an SCP in support of a MDAP or MAIS milestone review.
      3.1.1.2. At the discretion of SAF/FMC, SCPs may also be developed in support of other
      decisions outside the milestone decision environment (e.g. in support of unit cost breach
      reporting). A recommended SCP required outside the milestone decision environment
      may use the formal AFCAIG process described in Chapter 2, or the abbreviated process
      described here.
3.2. SCP Outside of an AFCAIG Review.
   3.2.1. SAF/FMC is the decision authority on procedures to be followed when generating a
   recommended SCP outside of the formal AFCAIG process. An abbreviated SCP process
   does not require a formal AFCAIG, instead a smaller group referred to as the Service Cost
   Group (SCG) is convened. In addition, where approved by SAF/FMC, the CIPT and CWG
   phases can be tailored, as appropriate.
      3.2.1.1. The SCG is headed by the SAF/FMC and comprised of the Program Manager,
      the Program Office cost estimating team, the AFCAA cost estimating team, AFCAA
      leadership and, where applicable, a representative from the organization requesting the
      SCP.
      3.2.1.2. There are two scenarios that can be followed when implementing the
      abbreviated process. The preferred scenario, Figure 3.1 involves the program office and
      AFCAA establishing the SCP in collaboration. In this case, the draft recommended SCP
      is briefed to the SCG chair (SAF/FMC) who forwards the recommended SCP to the SAE.
      Even if the program office and the AFCAA are in full agreement on the draft SCP, the
      SCG may still make changes to the estimate before it becomes the official recommended
      SCP.

      3.2.1.3. In the alternative scenario, Figure 3.2, both a POE and a NACA or ICE are
      prepared and differences are addressed during a cost estimate reconciliation process

      similar to that described in Chapter 2. The product of this reconciliation, a draft SCP, is
      briefed to the SCG with any unresolved differences highlighted for discussion and
      resolution/decision. The SCG makes the final determination on the recommended SCP
      that will be forwarded to the SAE.

      3.2.1.4. Though not required, development of a CARD is highly encouraged to support
      development of an SCP outside of the AFCAIG milestone process.

                                          Chapter 4

             COST ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION (CARD)

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance on the Cost Analysis Requirements Description
(CARD). A CARD is required for all MDAP and MAIS programs preparing for a Milestone
decision (A, B, C, and FRP or FDDR), as well as any program subject to the AFCAIG process
described in this document. DoDI 5000.02 also requires a CARD for MDAP MS B, C, and FRP
decisions, and any time a MAIS EA is required by statute or per MDA direction. Note that
Public Law 111-23 (WSARA), issued after the currently published version of DoDI 5000.02,
places new and more stringent cost estimate requirements at Milestone A.
4.2. Background.
   4.2.1. The CARD provides a description of the salient features of the acquisition program. It
   provides technical, schedule, and programmatic parameters facilitating a common,
   consistent, and accurate baseline for the program life cycle cost estimates. A well
   constructed CARD reduces the likelihood of misunderstanding program content and
   significantly reduces the time needed to reconcile cost estimates. Per DoDI 5000.02, the
   draft CARD must be provided at least 180 days prior to the planned OIPT or component
   review, unless a different due date is agreed to by the OIPT. The 180 day ―clock‖ starts as
   soon as the responsible cost estimating team lead determines that the CARD is complete,
   accurate, and suitable for use as the technical and programmatic baseline for the cost
   estimate. For ACAT ID and IAM programs, this determination is made by the OSD (CAPE)
   analyst. For ACAT IC and IAC programs where the service is the milestone decision
   authority, this determination is made by the AFCAA lead cost analyst.
   4.2.2. DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 7, and DoD 5000.4-M (Cost Analysis Guidance and
   Procedures) provides detailed information on how and when CARDs should be prepared. It
   includes a detailed outline of the information required in a CARD. A final CARD must be
   provided no later than 65 days prior to the planned OIPT or component review unless a
   different due date is agreed to by the OIPT. However, the CARD should not be finalized
   before the SCP reconciliation is complete.
4.3. Guidance.
   4.3.1. The CARD is a key component of the cost estimating process. It is the responsibility
   of the Program Manager, and is typically developed by the program’s engineering staff
   working in conjunction with the Program Manager. The cost estimating team is highly
   dependent on this document as it is the primary source of program technical and schedule
   information used to understand program scope and technology requirements.
   4.3.2. The CARD should be flexible and make reference to information available in other
   documents available to the cost estimators. For programs simultaneously engaged in a
   source selection and milestone review process, proposal information is often an essential
   component of the program definition. Under these circumstances, the CARD should be
   updated to include information that most accurately represents the program (such as ranges
   that reflect the entire spectrum of capable bidders, or the system description of the selected
   contractor), or the CIPT should be given direct access to the proposal information.
AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012                                                                     23


     4.3.2.1. The following paragraphs provide additional CARD guidance.
        4.3.2.1.1. The draft CARD should be delivered to the CIPT as soon as possible, but
        not later than 180 days prior to the OIPT. This facilitates timely feedback and early
        issue resolution.
        4.3.2.1.2. The program description in the CARD should be consistent with the
        approved program, as described in the APB, ADM (amendments included),
        requirements documents, etc.
        4.3.2.1.3. The CARD should cover all effort associated with the program, regardless
        of fund source or management control. It should address the responsibility of each
        funding source, including the responsibility of other Air Force programs and
        components.
        4.3.2.1.4. When a specific requirement is undefined or unknown at the time the
        CARD is prepared, an assumption should be provided. Assumptions provided should
        be consistent with those used to create the POE. A statement such as ―the specifics
        for this element are unknown at this time… for estimating purposes assume…‖
        should be included. ―To Be Determined‖ (TBD) is not acceptable.
        4.3.2.1.5. The final CARD should be coordinated by the MAJCOM A3/5, A4, A8,
        Product Center functional groups, and the CIPT before being submitted to the PEO
        for approval. The program office is responsible for ensuring the CARD is updated to
        reflect all program changes and the CIPT should be notified of all CARD updates.
        4.3.2.1.6. The CARD should include a copy of the program Work Breakdown
        Structure (WBS) dictionary and, where appropriate, address the relationship of
        specific Contract WBSs to the Program WBS. The CARD should include a draft cost
        structure for all phases of the system life-cycle (including the program WBS breakout
        and other categories such as MILCON, flight test site costs, O&S, etc.; reference
        DoD 5000.4-M, Chapter 2, Tables 2-2, 2-3, and 2-4 for a typical summary level
        breakout). CARD issues that cannot be resolved within the CIPT should be raised to
        the AFCAIG for resolution.
        4.3.2.1.7. Where applicable, contracted and projected reliability parameters at the
        Line Replaceable Unit/Shop Replaceable Unit (LRU/SRU) level, and support and
        training equipment lists should be provided.
        4.3.2.1.8. Where applicable, LRU development and procurement quantities should be
        provided. Identify items as developed, refurbished, Commercial Off-The-Shelf
        (COTS), or Non Developmental Items (NDIs).
        4.3.2.1.9. Where applicable, provide a list of prime contractors and subcontractors/
        vendors developing and producing subsystems/LRUs, by specific plant and location.
        4.3.2.1.10. Where applicable, MILCON, any identifiable R&M O&M facility
        requirements and estimates should be included and provided to the major command
        civil engineer for review.

                                           Chapter 5

                                     DOCUMENTATION

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance on the minimum documentation required for all
ACAT I, II and III cost estimates. More detailed cost estimate documentation is highly
encouraged.
5.2. Background. Chapter 1, DoD 5000.4-M requires cost estimate documentation be
submitted to the OSD (CAPE) for all ACAT ID programs. Draft documentation is required no
later than 45 calendar days prior to the scheduled OIPT or Component review. These
requirements also apply to all other programs subject to the AFCAIG process (i.e., ACAT IC and
IAM/C programs). Documentation for any other program cost estimate should be submitted to
the milestone/other decision authority and their cost analysis support organizations. As required
for cost and program reviews, all cost estimate documentation should be made available to
higher headquarters comptroller organizations. Documentation should be sufficiently complete
and well organized to enable a qualified cost professional to reconstruct the cost estimate given
access to only the documentation. For programs subject to the AFCAIG process, interim
documentation requirements should be established by the CIPT during the CIPT kick off
meeting.
5.3. Guidance.
   5.3.1. Cost estimate documentation provides a detailed record of the estimating methods,
   data, environment and events supporting the development or update of a cost estimate. It
   should be replicable and must be submitted electronically. Quality documentation makes an
   estimate more credible, aids in the analysis of changes in program cost, enables a reviewer to
   fully understand and replicate the cost estimate, contributes to the population of databases
   used to estimate the cost of future programs and facilitates continuous process improvement
   across the cost estimating community. Cost estimate documentation should:
       5.3.1.1. Contain an outline. A checklist with minimum documentation requirements is
       provided in Attachment 3.
       5.3.1.2. Include a summary of the cost estimate by program phase, by appropriation
       (APPN) and by Fiscal Year (FY). This summary should display both Then-Year (TY)
       and Base-Year (BY) dollars and delineate cost estimate confidence level(s).
       5.3.1.3. Describe cost estimate Ground-Rules and Assumptions (GR&As) such as cost,
       schedule and technical . GR&As are unique to the program, but should cover all
       influential areas. They include cost estimate limitations and caveats, methods and
       constraints applied to ―time phase‖ the estimate, estimate base year, inflation indices
       used, profit/fee assumptions, development and procurement quantities, participating
       agency support, government and contractor furnished equipment, and contractor rates and
       relationships.
       5.3.1.4. Display a breakout of total cost, by program phase and major cost element,
       paired with a brief summary of the cost estimating methods used to estimate the cost of
       all major cost drivers. Smaller dollar value cost elements may be rolled into an ―other‖
       line.
AFI65-508 6 JUNE 2012                                                                                 25


      5.3.1.5. Provide summary descriptions of the process used to address cost, technical, and
      schedule risks.
      5.3.1.6. Include a detailed estimating methods description section. This should include a
      detailed description of the WBS element content and the method and data applied to
      estimate the cost of every WBS element. For published Cost Estimating Relationships
      (CERs), data, statistics, etc. should documented.
             5.3.1.6.1. Estimated total and time phased costs, in BY$ and TY$, for each element
             and each roll-up element should be included in this section.
             5.3.1.6.2. A detailed discussion on the method used to consider cost, technical, and
             schedule risk, including a discussion on the rationale for risk bounds and distributions
             (normal, triangular, etc.) selected should be included in this section.
      5.3.1.7. Where produced, include a separate Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) or
      ―S-Curve‖ for each phase, in particular, for the development (Engineering and
      Manufacturing Development [EMD]) and production and deployment phases. Where
      practical, development and production and deployment CDFs can be provided by funding
      source. The point estimate, fifty percent confidence level, eighty percent confidence
      level and mean points should be identified. CDFs should display TY dollars and include
      only ―cost to go,‖ sunk costs should be excluded. Sunk cost should be noted at the
      bottom of the page. Along with the CDF, a table showing the cost estimate in 10%
      confidence level increments should be included. Table 5.1 provides a notional example.

     sunk costs or ―prior‖ year, FYDP, and ―to complete‖ costs. Prior year costs should equal
     program funds previously committed, obligated, and/or executed, and should therefore
     not reveal any shortfalls or excesses.
     5.3.1.9. Chronology of program cost estimates. Display the history of prior cost
     estimates (POE, NACA, SCP, and ICE) at each milestone decision and major program
     decision point, by program phase and by appropriation. Note that program phases may
     contain more than one appropriation. Currently, DoDI 5000.02 has four post MS A
     phases: Technology Development (TD); Engineering and Manufacturing Development
     (EMD), Production and Deployment (P&D), and O&S. Discuss the evolution of the cost
     estimates with particular emphasis on significant changes in estimated program cost,
     scope, or schedule. Also discuss any significant changes in program cost drivers or cost,
     technical, and schedule risk assessments. Initially display changes in TY dollars then
     convert to BY dollars to present inflation adjusted comparisons.
     5.3.1.10. Provide an assessment of the program technical and schedule baseline
     highlighting any deviations from the established (CARD or other reference materials)
     baseline.
     5.3.1.11. Identify the cost estimating team composition including all noteworthy
     contributors.

   A3.2.5. Cross checks, reasonableness and consistency checks addressed by WBS or CES.
   Specific references to studies, analogous systems or other appropriate documented
   references.
   A3.2.6. Track to prior estimate, and rationale for differences.
   A3.2.7. Reconciliation between the NACA/ICE and POE. Note: The body of the cost
   estimate documentation should provide information (source data, estimating methods, and

   results) sufficient to make it possible for a qualified cost estimator to recreate the estimate
   using only the written documentation.
A3.3. Additional checklist considerations identify whether:
   A3.3.1. All life cycle costs are included
   A3.3.2. Estimates are organized consistently and logically
   A3.3.3. Learning curve slopes and factors are reasonable, similar system slopes and factors
   are included as cross checks.
   A3.3.4. Actual historical data at or near program completion was used, when available.
   A3.3.5. Current inflation rates were used, documented and properly applied.
   A3.3.6. Historical data used is presented in the documentation, with rationale given as to
   why that data/program is applicable for use as an analogy and, where applicable,
   extrapolation is applicable.
   A3.3.7. Where systems have previously produced development or production units, unit or
   lot quantity and associated costs are provided.
   A3.3.8. Briefing charts reference program funding provided in the most current budget
   (President’s Budget or POM). If shortfalls exist, a zero ―shortfall‖ option is provided.
   A3.3.9. Acronyms are defined.
   A3.3.10. Personnel costs are consistent with the Manpower Estimate Report (MER), or
   deviations are properly explained.
   A3.3.11. Sensitivity analysis and risk/uncertainty analysis is documented.
   A3.3.12. Wrap rates and Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) / Forward Pricing Rate
   Recommendation (FPRR) assumptions are included.
