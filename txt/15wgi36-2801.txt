   GUIDE FOR FACE-TO-FACE EVALUATIONS (15 WG QUARTERLY/ANNUAL)

Figure A11.1. Guide for Face-To-Face Evaluations (15 WG Quarterly/Annual)
a. Personal Interview: The primary purpose of the face-to-face board is to ensure nominee’s
dress and appearance, military bearing, oral expression, and articulation of responses. This is a
very subjective area for board members to evaluate and you must baseline your judgment against
military standards.
Dress and Appearance:
Uniform: cleaned, pressed, and proper fitting.
Accouterments: properly placed on the uniform.
Jewelry: not more than three rings, correct earrings, no visible necklace, etc.
Decorations: ribbons in proper order, clean/serviceable condition.
Hair: appropriate style, length, color, approved ornamentation.
Military Bearing:
Room entry: appropriate facing movements
Reporting: appropriate introduction.
Posture
Communication Skills:
Pronunciation/Annunciation
Eye contact: direct and impartial.
Demonstrates ability to organize thoughts
Speech: appropriate rate, pitch, and volume
Non-verbals: appropriate use of facial expressions, gestures
NOTE: The board president is responsible for contacting the board members to provide
instructions in regards to preparing board questions. The board president will task each of the
board members with a specific category (see below for categories). Board members are to
prepare two questions (one primary and one alternate) for their respective tasked board category.
Board Guidelines: Questions will be opinionated, thought provoking, and designed to assess the
nominee’s ability to organize thoughts and articulate a response. Questions will come from some
or all of the following areas:
AF News/Current National/World Events.
General knowledge of current AF news or world events and their opinions regarding them.
Current Events will only cover the time period within three days of the scheduled board date.
Military Customs, Courtesies, and Service/Enlisted Heritage/Airman’s Creed.
Reference AFPAM 36-2241, Professional Development Guide, Current Edition, specifically the
chapter that covers Enlisted History and Military Customs, Courtesies, and Protocol for Special
Events . Ask opinionated questions (i.e. “What does the Airman’s Creed mean to me?”)
NOTE: When required, the board president will facilitate open discussion to resolve any
disparities that could skew the scoring process.

Table A11.2. Preparing For The Board
As the saying goes, “First impressions are lasting impressions.” All boards allow points for
dress, appearance, and military bearing. If you study and master the tips below, you will greatly
increase your chances for success.
                                                                                  Yes       No
Memorize: Airman’s Creed. Review: Study AFPAM 36-2241, Professional
Development Guide, Current Edition, chapters that cover Enlisted History and
Military Customs, Courtesies, and Protocol for Special Events (portions
applicable for SrA through TSgt) The PDG is available on line. Current events
are a must. Review current month’s Airman Magazine, and the Air Force
Times. Current event questions are usually compiled three days before the
board meets. Gather the majority of your information during that time frame.
Be prepared to answer scenario based questions on how you would
react/respond in handling specific leadership situations (based on your rank
and level of responsibility). Questions will be designed to give your opinion
but you must know some information about topics.
Write down your goals, aspirations, and extra curricular activities
(and practice expressing them verbally). Example: “I have just finished my
career development course and I’m awaiting my 5-skill level. I’m enrolled in
the Community College of the Air Force and currently possess 24 credit hours.
My goal is to receive my Associate’s Degree within two years.” Board
members are judging (and scoring) how you express yourself.
Write down your hobbies and a brief synopsis of your career (and remember
them). This is often an icebreaker question and gives you a chance to talk
about yourself.
Study a copy of the narrative that accompanied your nomination. Board
members often ask you to expound on information they find in the write up.
Know your current chain of command.
Practice facing movements in the same shoes you will be wearing when you
meet the board. Determine the location of the board and practice on the same
type floor covering (i.e., carpet, linoleum, etc.). Lastly, do a pre-visit to the
area/room if possible where the board will be held to familiarize yourself with
your surroundings.
Ensure your shoes look good. If it is raining the day that your board meets,
carry your shoes in a plastic bag and change when you get there. Ensure the
soles of your shoes are free of dirt and dust. Use polish and/or edge dressing
and ensure you have a fresh coat on. Take a small piece of cloth or old nylon
hose to wipe the dust off your shoes.
If the weather is bad, carry your uniform in a plastic bag and change when you
get there.
Remember to always get your service dress dry cleaned as a set--never do your
trousers/skirt and coat separately. This will prevent uneven fading.
Ensure your collar brass and ribbons are pristine.
Ensure ribbons are in the proper order and any you wear are updated in the
Personnel Data System/VMPS.

Use masking tape to remove lint from your service dress coat.
Males: Consider wearing shirt garters. Droopy socks and a baggy shirt do not
convey the image of a winner.
Do not have anything in your pockets except your ID card--no keys, change,
etc.
If meeting the board in a short sleeve shirt, clean your name tag with wax to
remove scratches.
Males: Get a haircut within a few days before meeting the board.
Females: Ensure bangs are off your eyebrows and hair does not extend below
the bottom of your collar. Don’t even make it close—board members
should not have to look twice to see if you’re in compliance.
