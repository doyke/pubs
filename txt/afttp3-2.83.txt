                                                 Preface
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency represents a significant
renaming and revision to the November 2007 publication Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
Installation CBRN Defense. It expands the scope from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)
defense to all-hazards installation emergency management (IEM), including the management of CBRN events.
This publication defines the roles of Department of Defense (DOD) installation commanders and staffs and
provides the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) associated with installation planning and preparedness
for response to, and recovery from, hazards to save lives, protect property, and sustain mission readiness. The
purpose of this publication is to summarize existing policies, responsibilities, and procedures for IEM programs
at DOD installations worldwide for all hazards, as defined by Department of Defense Instruction (DODI)
6055.17, and to translate this policy into tactical terms applicable to military installation commanders. The
contents have been written to complement Service IEM program manuals, standing operating procedures
(SOPs), response standards, training support packages, collective task training development products, training
center and unit exercises, and Service school curricula related to IEM.
The principal audience for Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency
Management is military installation commanders, functional and Service component staffs, emergency
managers, nonemergency management personnel performing collateral or additional emergency management
(EM) duties, and civil service and contract EM personnel with application to the joint force command and joint
task force that are tasked with the planning, preparation, and execution of EM. Trainers and educators
throughout DOD will also use this manual.
Commanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure their decisions and actions comply with applicable United States
(U.S.), international, and, in some cases, host nation (HN) laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels
ensure their Soldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement (see Field Manual
[FM] 27-10).
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency implements standardization
agreements (STANAGs) 2047 (Edition 7), STANAG 2521 (Edition 1), STANAG 2873 (Edition 4), and
STANAG 4359 (Edition 1).
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency uses joint terms where
applicable. Selected joint and Army terms and definitions appear in both the glossary and the text. Terms for
which Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency is the proponent (the
authority) are marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. For definitions shown in the text, the term is
italicized, and the number of the proponent follows the definition. This publication is not the proponent for any
new terms.
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency applies to installation
populations in their entirety, including active and reserve component military personnel unless otherwise stated;
DOD civilians; military families; installation tenants; transient military or U.S. government personnel;
contractor personnel; visitors and guests; HN personnel; third country national personnel; and other relevant
populations in the surrounding community outside of the installation.
The proponent of this publication is the U.S. Army CBRN School, who developed this publication with the joint
participation of the approving Service commands. We encourage recommended changes for improving this
publication. Please reference changes by specific page and paragraph, and provide a rationale for each
recommendation. Send comments and recommendations directly to—

                                               Introduction
     Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency discusses the principles of
     EM as they apply to military installations. This publications provides doctrine TTP for planning,
     preparedness, execution, and continuous assessment in each of the four phases of EM. During military
     operations, this publication is subordinate to current joint publications (JPs) that address related topics,
     such as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear consequence management (CM) and defense support
     of civil authorities (DSCA). It covers all-hazards and coordinating operations, such as emergency support
     functions (ESFs) or functional areas.
     The IEM involves the complex coordination of planning and response efforts with the installation
     command and staff; tenant command staff; and local, state, federal, and HN civilian authorities. Tenant and
     transient installation units also actively contribute resources to IEM mutual assistance plans. Installation
     commands strive to become familiar with the local community outside the installation that will impact EM
     operations. They are also knowledgeable of the relationship of their operations to federal guidelines
     governing civilian EM at national, state, and local levels.
     This document addresses the various roles of the installation command for each phase of an EM life cycle.
     The primary overlapping phases in an EM life cycle are—
           Preparing for installation emergencies.
           Responding to installation emergencies.
           Recovering from installation emergencies.
           Mitigating installation emergencies.
     Preparations for an installation emergency are directed toward planning, interoperability, and intelligence.
     Preparedness activities increase the resilience of the installation community and the response and recovery
     capabilities of the installation through risk management; coordination; task organization; equipment,
     training, and certification; exercise; and readiness evaluation.
     Response operations include the actions taken from the initial notification of a potential or actual incident
     until the transition to the recovery phase begins. Immediate response measures following an installation
     emergency include the notification of the affected populace within 10 minutes and the execution of the
     Incident Command System (ICS) by installation first responders. The emergency may also require the
     activation of emergency operations centers (EOCs). Response roles could extend beyond installation
     boundaries. Civil authority support and joint reception, staging, onward movement, and integration
     (JRSOI) functions also occur during the response phase. Most response functions are conducted using the
     ICS and are supported through ESFs or equivalent organizational structures (such as functional areas)
     within the EOC.
     The installation commander executes recovery operations within his own available organic and
     precoordinated resources. Recovery activities emphasize immediate response and mitigation measures to
     protect critical infrastructure and restore critical functions to their preincident capability. Short-term
     recovery actions seek to restore essential services and ensure that the needs of the installation community
     are met. Long-term recovery actions include restoring operations, rebuilding destroyed property, and
     reconstituting military operations and services. The main goal of recovery is mission reconstitution and the
     restoration of essential operations. The final steps of a recovery operation include capturing lessons learned
     and the subsequent required revisions of the EM plan upon reassessment. The National Disaster Recovery
     Framework (NDRF) was published in 2001, replacing the National Response Framework (NRF),
     Emergency Support Function (ESF)-14, Long-Term Community Recovery. The NDRF expands key ESF-
     14 concepts into a full framework.
     Mitigation actions involve the lasting (and often permanent) reduction of, exposure to, probability of, or
     potential loss from identified hazards. The goal of mitigation is to reduce the impact of identified hazards
     on critical/essential operations, critical assets, critical infrastructure, essential services, assigned personnel,
     and government and personal property. Mitigation is an ongoing process that feeds directly into the overall
     preparedness of the installation. Mitigation can be accomplished through the implementation of sustainable

Introduction



    development activities, vulnerability reduction measures, and hazard prevention efforts consistent with
    command guidance through the vulnerability assessment (VA) process.
    While the installation EM plan covers the usual activities associated with preparing for, responding to,
    recovering from, and mitigating the effects of an incident, the installation command and EM staffs also
    coordinate EM activities with various supporting entities established on and off the installation. Plans for
    the coordination and execution of ESFs or functional areas, continuity of operations (COOP), and critical
    infrastructure protection (CIP) are aligned with the installation EM plan to ensure the appropriate allocation
    of resources and manpower in all sectors of emergency response.
    The goal of this multi-Service publication is to revise the November 2007 edition of Multiservice Tactics,
    Techniques, and Procedures for Installation CBRN Defense to expand the scope from CBRN to all-hazards
    EM for individuals on, or assigned to, a DOD installation. Accordingly, this publication is renamed Multi-
    Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency Management. The decision to
    revise the multi-Service TTP resulted from—
           The publication of DODI 6055.17.
           The results of the Joint Requirements Office-led, front-end analysis that identified doctrinal gaps in
            the passive defense and weapons of mass destruction CM capabilities-based assessments.
           The request for feedback results received from the Services.

          Note. This publication is now aligned with DOD and federal civilian EM principles, policies,
          and guidance for all-hazards incidents.

                                                Chapter 1
    Fundamentals of Installation Emergency Management
        This chapter establishes the environment for installation EM. It provides the terms of
        reference and framework for IEM—prepare for, respond to, recover from, and
        mitigate the effects of an incident. It discusses the interface between military doctrine
        and federal guidance, such as the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the
        ICS, the NRF, and the National Preparedness Goal (NPG). It also presents an
        overview of the anticipated tasks and responsibilities of installation command and
        staff in the construction and proliferation of an IEM program. These fundamental
        principles guide the preparation for, and implementation of, the IEM program
        discussed in following chapters.

NATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
    1-1. Consistent with DODI 6055.17 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 5, IEM plans
    for domestic installations are developed in compliance with NIMS, ICS, NRF, and NPG procedures. Also
    consistent with DODI 6055.17, installations outside the United States implement NRF and NIMS principles
    as much as possible when executing IEM programs.
    1-2. The national structure for incident management establishes a clear progression of coordination and
    communication from the local level to regional and national headquarters levels. Specific elements of this
    governing structure are detailed in the following sections.

NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    1-3. For military installations, the use of NIMS supports the interoperability between installations, other
    Services, and the civilian community. All DOD components maintain interoperability with the ICS.
    1-4. The following are NIMS components:
            Preparedness.
            Communications and information management.
            Resource management.
            Command and management, including the ICS.
            Ongoing management and maintenance and supporting technologies.
    1-5. The NIMS process supports the following:
            Integrating incident-related prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery activities.
            Improving coordination and integration within the military operational area and with federal,
             state, local private-sector, and nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners.
            Increasing the efficient use of resources needed for more effective incident management.
            Improving situational awareness (SA) within the installation.
            Providing timely and accurate information for public awareness.
            Facilitating requests for assistance (RFAs) that exceed the installation response capability.
            Providing linkage to technical reachback capabilities.




26 April 2013                    ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                         1-1
Chapter 1



INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM
      1-6. The ICS is a flexible, standardized, on-scene, all-hazards incident management approach. It is
      executed and prioritized according to the principles of life safety, incident stabilization, and property
      conservation.
      1-7. The ICS enables the coordination and integration of personnel, facilities, procedures,
      communications, and equipment among various jurisdictions and functional agencies. It also establishes a
      common process for planning and managing resources.

NATIONAL RESPONSE FRAMEWORK
      1-8. The NRF is an all-discipline, all-hazards framework for the management of incidents. Consistent
      with DODI 6055.17 and HSPD 5, the DOD implements policy and procedures concordant with the roles
      and authorities under the NRF.
      1-9. The purpose of the NRF is to establish a comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to incident
      management; therefore, the elements of an installation response plan are consistent with the roles and
      authorities under the NRF.
      1-10. The following are the key principles of NRF doctrine:
               Engaged partnerships.
               Tiered responses.
               Scalable, flexible, and adaptable operational capabilities.
               Unity of effort through unified command (UC).
               Readiness to act.

NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS GOAL
      1-11. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8 sets a strategic vision for national preparedness by using a
      comprehensive approach to preparedness. It also requires the development and maintenance of the NPG.
      1-12. The NPG defines the core capabilities necessary to prepare for the incidents that pose the greatest
      risk to national security. The NPG establishes concrete, measurable, prioritized objectives to mitigate
      specific threats and vulnerabilities—including regional variations of risk—and emphasizes actions intended
      to achieve an integrated, layered, accessible, and all-of-nation/whole community preparedness approach
      while optimizing the use of available resources.

MISSION ANALYSIS
      1-13. The overarching objective of a comprehensive, all-hazards IEM program is to maintain DOD
      operational readiness throughout, and subsequent to, disasters or emergencies on or near DOD installations
      worldwide. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, the goals of the DOD IEM program are to—
               Prepare DOD installations for emergencies.
               Respond appropriately to protect personnel, save lives, and protect property.
               Recover and restore operations after an emergency.
      1-14. It is also DOD policy that IEM programs—
                 Maintain DOD readiness by establishing and maintaining a comprehensive, all-hazards IEM
                  program on DOD installations worldwide.
                 Support and assist U.S. civil authorities, as directed, in EM activities.
                 Coordinate preparedness, response, and recovery requirements and capabilities with state, local,
                  and tribal governments; other military departments; or HN partners by using an all-hazards
                  approach that balances risk management (threat, vulnerability, consequence), resources, and
                  need.
                 Align with federal guidance, which is outlined in the NIMS, ICS, and NRF and is consistent
                  with HSPD 5.

                                                       Fundamentals of Installation Emergency Management



STRATEGIC TO TACTICAL
    1-15. IEM planning involves strategic, operational, and tactical level plans. Strategic planning usually
    occurs at the higher echelon levels, and individual IEM plans develop operational and tactical level plans
    that support and adhere to the strategic guidance from higher headquarters.
              Strategic. At this level, decisionmakers determine broad objectives and develop high-level
               guidance for the IEM program. Lower-level plans developed by IEM personnel adhere to this
               guidance and accomplish these objectives.
              Operational. Operational objectives support strategic objectives, sequence events, initiate
               actions, and apply resources to begin and sustain activities. Operational planning is also
               conducted and sustained across the IEM program range of operations (prevent, respond,
               recover). Plans written at this level are more narrowly scoped and more detailed than strategic
               plans.
              Tactical. Tactical planning is more focused and detailed than operational planning. Activities
               are focused on the arrangement of resources in relation to each other and to a specific threat or
               hazard. Tactical plans are developed to support the objectives of operational plans.
              Services. Each of the Services has developed IEM programs based on unique Service
               requirements and existing DOD doctrine. While many aspects of the Service programs are
               similar, there are select differences that will be addressed by exception when necessary.

TERMS OF REFERENCE
    1-16. The following terms of reference and complementary doctrine apply throughout this document:
             All hazards. All hazards are any incident, natural or manmade, including those defined in DODI
              6055.07, that warrants action to protect the life, property, health, and safety of military members,
              dependents, and civilians at risk, and minimize any disruptions of installation operations (DODI
              6055.07).
             CBRN CM. CBRN CM is the response activities that require resource allocation beyond CBRN
              passive-defense capabilities for all deliberate and inadvertent release of CBRN hazard(s).
             CM. CM is the actions taken to maintain or restore essential services and manage and mitigate
              problems resulting from disasters and catastrophes, including natural, manmade, or terrorist
              incidents. It is a military-unique function that is coordinated with EM. (JP 3-28)
             EM. EM is the coordination and integration of all activities necessary to build, sustain, and
              improve the capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, or mitigate
              against threatened or actual natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other manmade disasters
              (NRF).
             EM alignment with CBRN defense activities. EM is not a military-unique function and is
              complementary to CBRN defense activities. IEM plans are developed in coordination with
              CBRN defense plans, including the recognition of potentially overlapping capabilities and
              resources. IEM capabilities and functions are not exempt from applicable Occupational Safety
              and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
              Health guidelines, or the guidelines of other applicable federal agencies. Additional information
              can be found in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological,
              Radiological, and Nuclear Consequence Management Operations.
             Geographic locations. U.S. military installations support operational forces in domestic and
              foreign environments. The installation location is critical in determining the laws and regulations
              that must be applied and in establishing the level of military authority that the installation
              commander may have in determining response actions, including the level of personal protection
              for the response force.
                  Domestic locations. Domestic locations are the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii,
                   the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the U.S. territories of Guam,
                   American Samoa, Jarvis Island, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, the
                   Freely Associated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall

                      Islands, and the U.S. possessions of Wake Island, Midway Island, Johnson Island, Baker
                      Island, Howland Island, Palmyra Atoll, and Kingman Reef (DODI 2000.21).
                     Foreign locations. Foreign locations are any geographic area not reflected in the definition
                      of domestic (DODI 2000.21).
                Installations. Installation is a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the
                 jurisdiction of the secretary of a military department or, in the case of an activity in a foreign
                 country, under the operational control of the secretary of a military department or the Secretary
                 of Defense. The term installation does not include leased facilities. (DODI 6055.17)

FRAMEWORK
      1-17. Chapters 2 through 5 describe the phases of IEM that can occur sequentially or simultaneously
      before, during, or after an emergency incident (see figure 1-1). The following are the phases of IEM:
                Prepare.
                Respond.
                Recover.
                Mitigate.




                                           Figure 1-1. The four phases of IEM


PREPARE
      1-18. The installation EM plan drives preparation efforts and facilitates response and recovery operations.
      Preparation and planning are based on an assessment of the operating environment. Operational
      assessments enable commanders and emergency managers to identify the minimum standards for training,
      organizing, equipping, and protecting resources. The implementation and approval of the EM plan (and
      related agreements) increase readiness through training and exercises. Chapter 2 discusses the preparation
      phase in more detail.
      1-19. Because of the breadth and scope of disasters that a comprehensive program must cover, IEM plans
      and programs are detailed and flexible. An IEM program will gain strength and substance through
      coordination with installation tenants and with local, state, federal, tribal, territorial, and HN authorities.

RESPOND
      1-20. Actions taken during this phase address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response
      measures include those actions taken to save lives, protect property, and continue essential services and
      operations. Chapter 3 discusses the response phase in more detail.

                                                       Fundamentals of Installation Emergency Management



RECOVER
    1-21. The focus of recovery activities is the restoration of mission capability and the essential public and
    government services interrupted by the incident. The recovery phase also includes completing the
    mitigation of the immediate hazard. Chapter 4 discusses the recovery phase in more detail.

MITIGATE
    1-22. Sustainable development and vulnerability reduction measures are initiated during the mitigation
    phase in support of hazard prevention and suppression of known hazards. Chapter 5 discusses the
    mitigation phase in more detail.
    1-23. IEM programs are comprehensive and address all hazards that the installation may experience,
    including natural and manmade incidents. These events may be intentional or accidental, foreseen or
    unpredictable. Employing an all-hazards approach encourages interoperability; enables the effective use of
    resources; and protects critical operations, personnel, assets, and the environment during likely emergency
    events.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
    1-24. IEM planning accounts for every relevant component of the operating environment on an installation.
    These components include threat considerations; geographic frameworks; political, military, economic, and
    social infrastructures; information systems; geographically remote locations; physical environments; and
    the technological facts detailed below.

THREAT
    1-25. There are common threat considerations that apply to military installations across the range of
    military operations, ranging from stable peace to general war conditions. Installations receive intelligence
    summaries that provide information on local or regional threats. Threats and hazards can range from
    adversarial actions, to manmade incidents, to natural disasters. Threat and hazard assessments are
    coordinated with similar assessments created by state and local civilian authorities. These authorities often
    have specific intelligence regarding natural hazard threats, such as information on hurricane susceptibility
    that would be useful in the preparation of a threat assessment for the installation. (See appendix B for
    additional information on threat and hazard assessments.)

GEOGRAPHIC FRAMEWORK
    1-26. The IEM plan accounts for the entire assigned operational area and the associated areas of interest.
    The operational area controls response actions and establishes boundaries within which the installation
    commander operates. The area of interest represents the environment external to the operational area for
    which the installation commander must maintain SA and may include surrounding communities and civil
    authorities with whom the installation commander establishes agreements for coordinated notification,
    response, and recovery operations.

POLITICAL SYSTEMS
    1-27. The political environment often impacts decisions to develop, approve, and honor support
    agreements between jurisdictions, especially in large-scale emergencies with the potential to impact the
    populace of another jurisdiction. Military authority, jurisdictional authority, and established agreements are
    among the important political and legal considerations for the installation commander.

MILITARY SYSTEMS
    1-28. Regardless of the scope or nature of an incident, military systems function under the appropriate
    designated military chain of command. Military units supporting an emergency on an installation or in
    support of a civil jurisdiction are always under the command of military authorities, even though these




26 April 2013                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              1-5
Chapter 1



      forces may provide support to civil authorities as directed under Department of Defense Directive (DODD)
      3025.18.

ECONOMIC SYSTEMS
      1-29. Installation commands operate within the usual economic system parameters in terms of
      appropriations for supplies and other resource requirements during the preparation and mitigation phases.
      During the response and recovery phases, emergency cost account codes are developed to track and
      manage response and recovery costs for submission to higher headquarters for supplemental funding
      requests and for reimbursement based on local support agreements.

SOCIAL SYSTEMS
      1-30. Installation commanders consider cultural, ethnic, and religious attitudes and behaviors that may
      impact operations. Installations have varying degrees of social environments confined within a small
      jurisdictional area. These environments range from long-term residents in family housing to short-term
      student populations, and from large, special-event crowds from local civil jurisdictions to cohesive
      combatant units stationed on post or transiting the installation for training and exercises. The social
      environment usually extends into local civil jurisdictions, with potentially large components of the military
      community residing outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the installation commander. The social
      environment often includes foreign nationals, including multinational partners and third-country nationals
      with varying social norms. The important political, legal, and cultural issues that the installation
      commander must address include—
                 Jurisdictional authority.
                 Established agreements and contracts.
                 Continuous media interaction.
                 Local customs.

INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
      1-31. Infrastructure systems determine specific requirements for transportation, utilities, communication,
      preparedness elements (evacuation and mutual aid timelines), and specific material requirements for
      response and recovery actions. Additional mitigation and prevention requirements may be required to
      ensure the protection and robustness of critical infrastructure.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS
      1-32. The installation commander strives to achieve enhanced SA and understanding through
      interoperability with other military and civil authorities. The installation commander determines the sources
      of information (including intelligence) and the appropriate stakeholders for information sharing. Certain
      incidents may require notification procedures among military commanders and civil authorities. These
      notification procedures are based on common agreements and preestablished methods.

GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE LOCATIONS
      1-33. Installations may be further defined by their location relative to local civil jurisdictions and
      supporting resource providers. Remote installation defines an installation that, due to its remote location in
      relation to other U.S. or HN response assets, may require additional capabilities to adequately respond to,
      and recover from, an emergency.

PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
      1-34. Key components of the physical environment include the effects of terrain and weather, the
      geographic framework that influences the installation commander’s plan, and the installation commander’s
      ability to exercise authority. Physical conditions drive mitigation and prevention requirements and
      determine the specific requirements for response and recovery operations in terms of area-specific
      organizing, training, equipping, and exercising personnel.

TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS
    1-35. The technological infrastructure and operations present on and around the jurisdiction directly impact
    the IEM program across all phases. These technological conditions may include the—
             Transit, storage, manufacture, or use of hazardous materials (HAZMAT).
             Ignition sources for available fuel loads.
             Potential for aviation, maritime, or land transport accidents.
             Increased reliance on cyber and electronic systems for daily operations.

SUMMARY
       1-44. In the United States, EM is structured according to the guiding national principles found in the NRF,
       NIMS, NPG, and ICS. All IEM plans and activities comply with this guidance. This instruction
       promulgates a comprehensive, all-hazards EM framework that is organized into the following four
       integrated phases: prepare, respond, recover, and mitigate. In the planning and execution of an IEM
       program, installation commanders consider the unique factors of their own operating environment.
       Installation staffs are cognizant of their roles and responsibilities in the creation and implementation of an
       IEM program.

                                              Prepare
        Preparedness consists of the activities that occur before the onset of an incident or
        event to prepare personnel, installation tenants, emergency responder elements, and
        the base population for the eventual response to, and recovery from, an emergency.
        These activities may decrease the effects of a hazard or threat, decrease the likelihood
        of occurrence, and/or increase the resilience of the installation. Activities completed
        during the preparation phase include—
                  Planning.
                  Reconnaissance.
                  Interagency coordination.
                  Training, exercises, and evaluation.
                  Resource management.
                  Instilling community awareness.

ACTIONS

KEY PERSONNEL
    2-4. The installation emergency manager is the day-to-day coordinator of the installation IEM program
    and is essential to the success of each program. Installation emergency manager responsibilities are listed in
    chapter 1 and in DODI 6055.17.
    2-5. Each IEM program categorizes personnel by using the definitions outlined in DODI 2000.16 to
    identify and manage personnel resources of emergency responders, first responders, critical personnel, and
    essential personnel.

INSTALLATION EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WORKING GROUP
    2-6. The IEMWG is a key element of the IEM program and provides a mechanism for coordination of
    installation functions and delineation of EM responsibilities within the installation. Consistent with DODI
    6055.17, the IEMWG—
               Is established under the direction of the installation commander and the installation emergency
                manager.
               Meets at least quarterly.
               Includes the following suggested members:
                    The installation commander or commander’s representative.
                    The program coordinator (such as the installation emergency manager).
                    The senior installation chaplain.
                    Representatives from antiterrorism (AT), CBRN, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD),
                     medical, disaster behavioral health, safety, public health, logistics, legal, security, fire and
                     emergency services (F&ES), public affairs, and tenant and subordinate commands and units.
               Ensures that the activities associated with establishing and sustaining the IEM program are
                performed according to this and other appropriate instructions and directives.

EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER
    2-7. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, an EOC is the distinctive location at which the coordination of
    information and resources to support the incident commander (IC) occur. The EOC is activated to support
    on-scene response during an escalating incident by relieving the burden of external coordination and
    securing additional resources.
    2-8. The EOC consists of personnel and equipment appropriate for the incident level and can manage
    multiple incidents and planned events.
    2-9. The EOC is usually located near the center of the base or installation, close to the administrative
    offices and other emergency services such as fire response and medical services. This allows prompt
    response for commanders, support personnel, and emergency response team members. EOC management
    administrative offices are located in the EOC, and all EOC team members have rapid access to the EOC.
    Base commander offices are usually nearby. Also, careful consideration of the EOC location with respect to
    supplemental EOC staff resource locations, will allow for a timely response. Such a location and the day-
    to-day use of the EOC help ensure the immediate availability of key personnel and communications.

          Note. Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-141-04 is the DOD source document for establishing
          and updating an installation EOC according to HSPD-5.

Chapter 2



      2-10. If a risk area is identified, the EOC is located away from the area of highest risk. Risk areas may
      include major fault lines; flood surge zones; floodplains; dam inundation zones; fire pathways; central areas
      subject to conflagration; avalanche paths; areas of unstable soil; HAZMAT production or storage facilities;
      nuclear plants, waste storage, or transportation pathways; and railways that transport HAZMAT. The
      following are additional location considerations:
                Determine the level of mitigation that may be required in response to the hazard if the location
                 options place the EOC within—
                     A hazard source zone.
                     The explosive safety quantity distance arc.
                     A prescribed 10-mile radius of a nuclear power plant emergency planning zone.
                Identify utility locations, including underground and overhead lines for electrical power, water
                 supply, sewer, gas or petroleum, communications, and other utilities that may be in the planning
                 zone.
                Ensure that the EOC is located in an area where it can be secured.
                Identify site perimeters, perimeter barriers and fences, control gates, and other means of securing
                 site perimeters.
                Make soil bores to determine subgrade conditions that could impact EOC survivability in a
                 disaster incident.
                Identify where the command administration is located, and provide access for military command
                 personnel to the EOC.
                Identify the location of emergency response and support services including law enforcement
                 (LE), fire, medical, transportation, public works and engineering, munitions range control, and
                 other relevant support services.
                Locate the EOC where congestion will not hinder access and where other contiguous facilities
                 cannot impair EOC functions.
                Locate the EOC where radio and other communication systems can operate most
                 advantageously, have the most coverage, and are away from radio interference such as power
                 lines and tall metal structures.
                Verify that the site has an adequate area for the EOC building, required setbacks, and parking.
                Determine the type of available parking (surface versus garage) and if the parking can be
                 secured.
                Determine if the site can accommodate helicopter access.
                Identify flight paths near the EOC site.
                Identify nearby active commercial, private, and military airports.
                Ensure that the EOC is not exposed to overhanging trees or forest from which wind-blown
                 debris can strike the EOC.

            Note. Debris and dust can damage essential EOC equipment such as antennas; heating,
            ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); and generator motor filter systems.

      2-11. The EOC site should be easily and quickly securable in the event of an emergency. This includes the
      protection of—
                Staff.
                Buildings.
                Communication systems.
                Utility services.
                Transportation services.
      2-12. The location within a building is an important factor. The first consideration is given to subgrade
      locations where the EOC is protected from blast, windborne debris, windstorms, and other hazards. Special
      caution is given when EOC locations are proposed on upper floors of structures since access can be

                                                                                                         Prepare



    hindered by nonworking elevators and compromised egress stairs. Upper floors may also be more
    susceptible to windstorm damage.
    2-13. Verify that the facilities selected for EOC use have ample area to create large operations and
    communication rooms and that they have the additional area necessary for support spaces. Verify that the
    facility has, or can accept, the infrastructure to support the protection, cabling, and environmental control
    necessary in the EOC. Verify that the exterior envelope is at, or can be upgraded to, the necessary EOC
    protection levels.
    2-14. The EOC should not be located in a high-rise building or next to a high-rise building that can
    collapse. The following are additional areas of concern:
              Possible expansion requirements when locating the EOC.
              Compatibility of other functions with the EOC if the proposed facility will be occupied by those
               other functions.
              Increased security necessary for the EOC during full operations impairs the functions of other
               tenants.
              Subgrade water when locating EOCs in subgrade building areas.

          Note. Although designs may be contrived to withstand groundwater pressure during normal
          operating procedures, damage to EOC subgrade structures may allow water (under pressure from
          bomb or earthquake shock, liquefaction, or flooding) to enter into the EOC.

    2-15. Plan an alternate site for the EOC. In addition to the primary EOC, an alternate location is planned in
    the event that the primary EOC cannot perform its function. The alternate EOC becomes the primary
    command and control point when the primary EOC is disabled.
    2-16. The secondary site is prepared and is capable of immediate activation, and relocation plans for
    moving staff and essential items (such as secure documents) to the alternate site are in place. The alternate
    site is selected to minimize, to the greatest extent possible, the degree to which the major hazards that
    impact the primary EOC will affect the alternate site. Usually, criteria that apply to the primary EOC will
    apply to the alternate EOC. The following are some considerations for selection of a secondary site:
               Consider the relationship of the alternate EOC to the base or installation administrative centers
                and emergency services.
               Consider the accessibility of the site by the emergency operations team. (While the alternate
                EOC is at a different location to avoid both centers being disabled by the same event, access for
                staff from their normal duty posts is an essential concern.)
               Consider placing the alternate EOC at a site served by roadways other than those that serve the
                primary EOC. (Particular attention is given to access routes that could be blocked by flooding,
                rail lines, traffic congestion, or other features that can be circumvented by the alternate site.)
               Verify that the alternate EOC has adequate parking.
               Determine how the resident function will be performed during an incident if the alternative EOC
                has a dual-use function.
               Verify that the resident function will be suspended during EOC use of the alternate facility.

          Note. The EOC has redundant power and telecommunications. It is fed from two grids and has a
          second telecom network in the building.


RISK MANAGEMENT
    2-17. EM planning is predicated on critical asset, threat/hazard, vulnerability, consequence, and response
    capability assessments. These assessments are used to evaluate the ability of an installation to respond to a
    threat/hazard, protect the population on the installation, and implement strategies to mitigate risks.




26 April 2013                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              2-5
Chapter 2



      2-18. Risk management is a comprehensive process and a critical planning element of IEM that allows for
      the estimation of the necessary elements before, and continuous with, the development of the IEM plan.
      (Additional information regarding risk management is outlined in appendix B.)
      2-19. IEM risk management is a continuous process. After the IEM plan is promulgated, the installation
      senior staff members schedule periodic follow-ups to reassess IEM preparations. These periodic follow-ups
      help ensure that necessary resources remain properly deployed, prepared, and synchronized to successfully
      execute IEM tasks. Reassessments occur at least annually before an update or review of the IEM plan and
      concurrently with changes in threat or unit and resource availability.
      2-20. Issues that justify and prioritize hazards/threats used for planning are well documented so that the
      facts governing these decisions can be reviewed with each risk management process review.

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
      2-21. The VAs allow commanders to take a holistic look at installation strengths and weaknesses compared
      to the operating environment and identified threats. VAs are conducted annually (before the update or
      review of the IEM plan) using joint staff/defense threat reduction agency vulnerability assessment
      benchmarks, consistent with DODI 6055.17. The assessment results determine the basis and justification
      for IEM program enhancements, program planning, and budget requests.

THREAT/HAZARD ASSESSMENT
      2-22. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, installations perform threat/hazard assessments in coordination with
      the assessments performed for AT and the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP). Threat/hazard
      assessments use the joint staff/Defense Threat Reduction Agency vulnerability assessment benchmarks,
      Service guidance, or combatant command guidance to address the broad range of hazards/threats to the
      installation and personnel. The assessment identifies hazards/threats and the likelihood of them occurring.
      After the threats/hazards are assessed, efforts are necessary to mitigate their potential effects and to prevent
      them from affecting the installation and its associated mission-essential functions.

CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT
      2-23. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, installations conduct capability assessments and consider
      contingency planning activities. The objectives of the capability assessment are to—
               Consider the range of identified and projected response capabilities necessary for responding to
                hazards.
               List installation resources by type to provide an asset capability report.
               Review policy, guidance, and planning documents to identify the mission-essential tasks and
                functions assigned to the organization.
               List installation personnel who have mission-essential EM responsibilities.
               Identify costs associated with assessment outcomes for future budget planning.

INSTALLATION EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN
      2-24. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, each installation IEM plan is comprehensive, covers all hazards, and
      is designed to support preincident planning, mitigation, emergency response, and recovery. The IEM plan
      is flexible enough for use in all emergencies and is detailed enough to provide a course of action for
      installation commanders to apply to an unexpected event. Elements of the IEM plan are further detailed in
      appendix C.
      2-25. The IEM planning and development begin with reviews of the operating environment and the
      structure of the installation command and staff. Military planning processes develop these assessments and
      estimates into the final IEM plan. Some Services may use the Federal Emergency Management Agency
      (FEMA) Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 1-01 to structure their planning process.




2-6                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                 26 April 2013
                                                                                                          Prepare



    2-26. IEM plans are reviewed at least annually (sooner if conditions warrant) to ensure the integration of
    changes in threats, VAs, capabilities, and command relationships with civil authorities. Other appropriate
    triggers for IEM plan review include results and AARs from training, exercises, and actual events.
    2-27. The installation commander and staff have the primary responsibility for ensuring the development
    and maintenance of the IEM plan. Under the direction of the command, the installation emergency manager
    and the IEMWG develop, maintain, execute, and revise the IEM plan according to the specifications of this
    and other instructions and directives, as appropriate.
    2-28. IEM plans are developed with a clear understanding and identification of the mission-essential
    functions of the installation. According to the DOD mission assurance strategy, the first pillar of mission
    assurance is the identification and prioritization of mission-essential functions and supporting assets and
    systems. The COOP community has defined a mission decomposition architecture that can be used to
    define these assets. Installations should review this architecture on a routine basis as part of operational
    planning.
    2-29. The individual elements of the IEM plan are included in applicable installation-specific EM exercises
    to ensure that assigned personnel are well prepared in their individual roles. All IEM plans are coordinated
    with tenant, federal, state, local, other Service, and/or private (or HN) response and/or recovery partners.
    For details on plan development and maintenance, including the construction of the threat/hazard
    vulnerability and risk assessment, see appendixes B and C.
    2-30. Installation preparedness includes tracking and disseminating information about the threat
    environment. The installation may use different methods to track and disseminate specific threat/hazard
    information. These mechanisms are considered for incorporation into the IEM plan.

SUPPORT FOR COORDINATING PROGRAMS
    2-31. IEM programs coordinate with existing installation protection programs to the extent that their
    objectives and responsibilities overlap or complement one another. IEM maintains an active dialogue with
    the AT, COOP, and CIP programs on the installation to ensure the coordination of efforts and resources.

ANTITERRORISM/FORCE PROTECTION
    2-32. Consistent with DODI 2000.16, the AT program is one of several security-related programs that fall
    under the overarching combating terrorism and force protection (FP) programs. The AT program is a
    collective, proactive effort focused on the prevention and detection of terrorist attacks against DOD
    personnel, their families, facilities, installations, and infrastructure critical to mission accomplishment and
    on the preparation to defend against, and plan for, the response to the consequences of terrorist incidents.
    AT and EM programs coordinate plans for terrorism CM preparedness and response measures and
    continued essential military operations.

CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS
    2-33. The purpose of a COOP program is to provide for the continual operation of installation mission-
    essential functions and associated critical mission facilities (CMFs) throughout an emergency. A COOP is a
    separate process from EM; however, the management of emergencies is interrelated with, and highly
    dependent on, full COOP planning efforts and the coordination of EM plans with COOP plans at
    installation, local, and regional levels. The responsibility of the installation is to support such efforts and
    ensure that installation level services required to execute the COOP plan of the mission-essential function
    are developed and made available during a contingency requiring the activation of the COOP plan. It is the
    responsibility of the commander in charge of the mission-essential functions to sign the applicable COOP
    plan, finance the identified requirements, and coordinate COOP requirements with the installation,
    specifically through the IEMWG.




26 April 2013                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                               2-7
Chapter 2



      2-34. A COOP program involves—
              Protecting infrastructures deemed critical to force and materiel readiness and operations in
               peace, crisis, and war.
              Mitigating the loss or disruption of mission-essential functions and planning for timely
               restoration or recovery of mission-essential functions through an appropriate devolution of the
               operations plan.
              Planning for the dependence on other assets (infrastructures, utilities, facilities, private sector
               services, other government departments and agencies) to help accomplish the installation
               mission.
              Coordinating with private and nonmilitary asset owners on the security and protection of critical
               civilian infrastructures and assets.
              Maintaining information sharing, cooperative agreements, and outreach efforts with the private
               sector, including partnerships with state and local governments and HNs.
      2-35. Based on DODD 3020.26 and DODI 3020.42, certain mission-essential functions and associated
      CMFs are capable of remaining uninterrupted or resuming function during the first 12 hours after the
      occurrence of an emergency and through the full resumption of all functions. During an emergency, most
      of the mission-essential functions may be relocated to a complementary CMF at another location or at a
      designated emergency relocation site (ERS). The capability to perform mission-essential functions at
      alternate sites is fully operational as soon as possible, but no later than 12 hours after COOP activation.
      Detailed information on COOP planning and implementation can be found in DODI 3020.42.
      2-36. The identification and criticality of mission-essential functions are examined by determining the
      consequences of their nonperformance. After a function has been deemed mission-essential, it is prioritized
      in relation to other mission-essential functions. Consistent with DODI 3020.42, areas for consideration as
      mission-essential include, but are not limited to—
                Command and control.
                Command decisions and strategies.
                Crisis communications.
                Crisis data storage, retrieval, and security.
                Legal obligations.
                Fiscal and contractual obligations.
                Personnel.
                Critical support to or from other DOD installations, components, agencies, or departments.
      2-37. The COOP plan provides preplanned processes, assets, and the concept of operations that the
      organization is required to have in place to manage the response, recovery, and reconstitution of mission-
      essential functions after an event. COOP planning involves identifying and documenting mission-essential
      functions and supporting CMFs. The COOP plan is built on the results of a thorough VA. The installation
      and the accompanying commands of each mission-essential function and supporting CMF develop and
      maintain a COOP plan pertaining to their organization. Each of these COOP plans aligns with the other
      coordinating COOP plans as appropriate. Mission-essential functions and associated CMFs review their
      COOP plan annually and submit changes to the supporting installation emergency manager.
      2-38. COOP plans also contain—
              Organizational structure, succession to command, and delegation of authority to appropriate staff
               data.
              Personnel manning requirements and procedures to ensure that sufficient, qualified personnel are
               available throughout the duration of the emergency.
              Logistics plans to sustain operations at the ERS.
              Lists of mission-essential documents and equipment to be made available at the alternate site.
              A plan for the devolution of operations.
              Higher headquarters reporting requirements.

               Training requirements for COOP positions critical to maintaining command and control during
                emergencies, including personnel designated to staff the ERS.
               A security element personnel requirement to protect staff and safeguard classified references and
                material.
    2-39. An excellent series of templates for COOP and devolution of operations planning can
    be found at <http://www.fema.gov/government/coop/index.shtm>. These templates were constructed for
    federal agencies; however, they can be customized for use at the military installation level.
    2-40. FEMA has constructed a continuity assistance tool for nonfederal entities to identify continuity
    strengths and areas for improvement. It can be easily tailored to fit the needs of an installation evaluating its
    own continuity readiness. The tool can be found at <http://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/org/ncp/cat.pdf>.

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION
    2-41. The CIP program identifies, assesses, and enhances the security of physical and cyberspace assets
    and associated infrastructures essential to the execution of the National Military Strategy. Military
    operations are heavily dependent on shared critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR). This
    interconnectivity better enables mission accomplishment; however, it also increases vulnerability to human
    error, natural hazards, and physical or cyberspace attacks. Therefore, it is imperative to identify, protect,
    and ensure the continuity of mission-critical infrastructures. As with COOP, CIP is a separate process from
    EM, yet the management of emergencies is interrelated with, and highly dependent on, full CIP planning
    efforts and coordination of EM plans with CIP plans at installation, local, and regional levels.
    2-42. Consistent with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Critical Infrastructure and Key
    Resource Center documents (available at <http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/IS860a/CIKR/index.htm>),
    critical infrastructures are the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, whose damage or
    destruction would weaken national defense or economic security, as in the elimination of critical services
    or capabilities to an identified mission-essential function or associated CMF. Key resources include
    publicly and privately controlled resources essential to the operations listed above.
    2-43. Consistent with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, the CIP program involves—
            Identifying critical resources, assets, systems, and networks.
            Identifying internal and external vulnerabilities to those resources and assessing their risks.
            Recognizing the relationship between vulnerabilities and operational readiness.
            Prioritizing assets in relation to their operational criticality and risk level.
            Mitigating/managing the vulnerabilities and employing resiliency strategies, if possible.
            Measuring the effectiveness of mitigation efforts.
            Planning for contingencies, including dependence on others assets (infrastructures, utilities,
             facilities, services of the private sector, other government departments and agencies) to help
             accomplish the installation mission.
    2-44. A risk management-based CIP plan is developed and maintained. The plan aligns with other
    coordinating CIP plans, including neighboring civilian agency plans, as appropriate. When requested, host
    installation and tenant commands develop and submit local plans for CIP remediation and mitigation, CIP
    tabletop and field exercises, and local CIP best practices. Each installation evaluates existing support
    agreements (including MOUs, MOAs, MAAs, and ISSAs) as the basis for integrating their CIP tasks. The
    evaluation of support agreements identifies installation risks and vulnerabilities that are created by a
    reliance on other Service, government, or civil sector infrastructures and key resources. The evaluation also
    identifies tools to reduce risks and vulnerabilities or to ensure the protection of those assets and mitigate
    their associated risks.
    2-45. On an installation level, CIP is not usually within the purview of the installation command or the
    IEM staff. The owners or operators of the utilities or services are usually responsible for this function. As
    on the federal level, building partnerships with controlling agencies increases the likelihood that
    infrastructure and resources are available to the installation during an emergency.




26 April 2013                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                 2-9
Chapter 2



       2-46. Each installation emergency manager maintains information sharing, cooperative agreements, and
       outreach efforts with the private sector (including partnerships with state and local governments and HNs)
       to identify collaborative avenues in the protection of infrastructure that is vital to the installation and its
       mission.
       2-47. DODI 2000.16 delineates the needed installation and higher headquarters review and reporting for
       CIP from an AT perspective. For more information on CIP, see DODD 3020.40 and DODI 3020.45 and
       review the FEMA Emergency Management Institute courses available online, IS-860.a, The National
       Infrastructure Protection Plan, and IS-821, Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Support Annex.

CIVILIAN COORDINATION AND INTEROPERABILITY
       2-48. A major objective of preparedness efforts is to ensure mission integration and interoperability in
       response to emergent crises across functional and organizational lines and between public and private
       organizations. This integration effort includes interagency coordination, coordination with tenant and
       transient units on the installation, and the interoperability of procedures and resources with civilian
       counterparts.

COORDINATION
       2-49. Responding to an incident on an installation may require all existing installation first and emergency
       responder assets. If installation organic response capabilities are exceeded or do not exist for a particular
       hazard or threat, installation commanders may require assistance from nearby federal, state, local, other
       Service, and/or private (or HN) capabilities to effectively respond to, and recover from, an incident. Close
       liaison with these agencies and departments in advance is essential to ensure that adequate resources are
       available when required.
       2-50. Each installation ensures that IEM plans of various components and tenants within the installation
       have been thoroughly coordinated with each other; with the response plans of local, state, and federal
       organizations; and with the plans of joint task forces, multinational forces, or HN forces and organizations.
       Coordination is necessary to identify and update responsible points of contact, emergency protocols, and
       expectations in the event of an incident on (or of an incident that impacts) a DOD installation consistent
       with DODI 2000.16, DODI 6055.06-M, and National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 1600. Coordination
       also helps ensure the sharing of information pertaining to locally available technologies and capabilities
       that may provide early warning of a potential threat or hazard (biomonitoring, chemical or radiological
       detection, intrusion detection, decision support tools).
       2-51. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, installation commanders may develop or provide input to support
       agreements with local emergency services, including local EM agencies. These support agreements include
       MAAs or other support agreements written as MOAs, MOUs, ISSAs, SOFAs, or support contracts.
       Installation legal counsel personnel assist in the preparation of the agreements and perform a legal review
       of them before execution. The support agreements are reviewed and exercised at least annually, and the
       contents of each support agreement are seamlessly integrated into the IEM plan.
       2-52. MAAs enable installations and local, state, and federal organizations to provide resources, facilities,
       services, and other required support to one another during a life-threatening or significant property-
       threatening incident. Preestablished MAAs with private organizations are necessary to facilitate the timely
       delivery of assistance at the appropriate organizational level during incidents. MAAs include, at a
       minimum, the following elements or provisions:
                 Definitions of key terms used in the agreement.
                 Roles and responsibilities of individual parties.
                 Procedures for requesting and providing assistance.
                 Procedures, authorities, and rules for payment, reimbursement, and allocation of costs.
                 Notification procedures.
                 Protocols for interoperable communications.
                 Relationships with other agreements among organizations.
                 Procedures for workers’ compensation.

                                                                                                           Prepare



               Immunity and liability rules and treatment.
               Recognition of qualifications and certifications.
               Sharing agreements, as required.
               Periods for review.
               Cancellation procedures.
    2-53. Maintaining effective coordination and liaison between installation, tenant, and transient units is the
    responsibility of all those concerned. Preferably, before their first arrival at an installation, the EM
    representative of the transient unit will initiate specific coordination measures and information exchanges
    with the installation command regarding operational, intelligence, or logistics needs that the transient unit
    may require, or be able to provide to, the installation.
    2-54. Adequate preparation and coordination is essential to the success of the liaison and coordination
    activities from the installation and a tenant, transient unit, or annex. Coordination is an integral part of the
    planning process, and it is important that the tenant and transient units maintain a full understanding of the
    installation commander’s emergency response plan.
    2-55. Consistent with DODI 6200.03, each MTF or equivalent ensures that force health protection
    measures and public health EM are integrated into existing DOD installation and/or military command
    emergency preparedness and response plans and agreements. Each installation coordinates with the nearest
    MTF command to ensure parallel efforts and synchronized expectations for preparedness and response
    between the installation and MTF. Medical response plans for the installation and MTF interface with
    corresponding local, state, federal, or HN agency EM activities.

INTEROPERABILITY
    2-56. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, DODI 3020.52, and PPD 8, IEM programs are interoperable with
    EM efforts in their civilian mutual aid community or HN to ensure an effective and efficient emergency
    response. Interoperability includes the technical exchange of information, IEM systems, processes,
    procedures, organizations, and missions and is balanced with information assurance.
    2-57. The interoperability requirements of equipment, communication systems, and other EM capabilities
    are identified and improved through interagency collaboration, coordination, and participation in all aspects
    of EM. Interoperability efforts can also be improved through the mutual inclusion of civilian agencies in
    installation exercises and training and through the participation of key installation personnel in local
    community exercises.

INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY PREPAREDNESS AND COMMUNITY
AWARENESS
    2-58. Individual and community preparedness is a time and resource multiplier for the installation
    emergency response effort. Help may not always arrive when expected; therefore, an installation can
    implement individual and family preparedness efforts to ensure that personnel, their families, and other
    community members are prepared to immediately respond to emergencies on their own until help becomes
    available. A well-informed community will prevent an unnecessary delay of response efforts, and their
    resilience will allow activated responders to concentrate on mitigating the hazard and initiating recovery
    operations.

INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY PREPAREDNESS
    2-59. Per PPD 8 and HSPD 21, the responsibility for proper emergency preparedness extends to the family
    and individual level. The proper preparedness of both the individual and the family is essential to the
    overall success of an IEM program, especially due to the reliance on evacuation, movement to safe haven,
    movement to shelter, lockdown, and shelter-in-place (SIP) as the primary protective strategies for many
    families and individuals associated with the installation community. Installation personnel are highly
    encouraged to develop a personal or family emergency plan (including a plan for pets) and to develop and
    maintain a personal or family emergency kit.



26 April 2013                   ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              2-11
Chapter 2



       2-60. Military families and individuals (especially those stationed abroad) have unique emergency
       readiness considerations that distinguish them from the general population. Families and individuals
       associated with an installation have likely often moved to new locations and may not have a strong
       understanding of possible evacuation routes or locations of emergency supply stores if they are new to the
       area. They also may not speak the native language of their HN. In addition, while much of the general
       population relies on other family members in their area during an emergency, members of the military
       community are less likely to live near extended family. On the positive side, because installation
       community members are accustomed to relocating often, they are uniquely prepared for certain aspects of
       emergency readiness, such as the collection and recording of important personal and financial records
       before an evacuation.
       2-61. Detailed preparedness guidance, especially regarding planning and family or individual preparedness
       kits, is available at the FEMA Web site <http://www.ready.gov>. This site also has a section dedicated to
       the unique considerations of military family preparedness that links to Service-specific public awareness
       programs.

COMMUNITY AWARENESS
       2-62. Successful response operations begin with building a resilient military community that is actively
       engaged in installation preparedness efforts. Installation personnel may recognize the hazard first and
       notify the installation dispatch center by dialing 9-1-1 or another local emergency number. Installation
       personnel may also be inclined to actively engage in response efforts, including organizing evacuation and
       sheltering plans, performing initial treatment of the wounded, and gathering and providing information to
       first responders.
       2-63. Achieving a resilient community requires a targeted public awareness program and quality outreach
       products. Service-specific programs (such as Ready Army, Ready Air Force, and the Navy’s Operation
       Prepare) are proactive programs that increase the survivability and resilience of military community
       members by informing them about relevant hazards, appropriate response procedures, and contamination
       avoidance measures and by encouraging them to have an emergency plan and kit.
       2-64. It is imperative that the community be engaged early and often in the planning and preparation
       process of the IEM program. Key partners in the installation effort to build a resilient community may
       include Fleet and Family Readiness (U.S. Navy [USN]); the public affairs office; morale, welfare and
       recreation; housing and welcome centers; and others. Community awareness programs are regularly
       scheduled events that can occur at in-processing or during annual training and are recurring throughout the
       year via various venues, such as the post newspaper or family assistance Web sites.
       2-65. Before an event, the community can be involved in a dialogue with the installation and its key
       partners to provide outreach materials tailored to address local emergency threats. This awareness program
       can also target specific audiences (families with children or pets, special-needs individuals, unmarried
       people) and convey the following information:
                 Where to get information before, during, and after an emergency.
                 What actions are required of them in the event of an incident on or near the installation.
                 How to prepare individual and family preparedness plans and why they are important.
                 How to prepare emergency kits for themselves, their families, and their pets.
                 What services to expect from the installation before, during, and after an incident.

TRAINING, EXERCISES, AND EVALUATION
       2-66. IEM organizations and personnel at all levels have opportunities for individual, collective, and
       collaborative training and exercises to effectively provide the installation with an all-hazards incident
       management capability. The value of these training and exercise programs is continually and consistently
       evaluated internally and externally to ensure relevance and validity for IEM capability development.




2-12                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                             26 April 2013
                                                                                                        Prepare



TRAINING
    2-67. IEM programs establish minimum training standards for the effective management of all-hazards
    emergencies. Installations train to perform individual and collective EM tasks as units and joint forces.
    Licensing and certification standards vary based on geographical locations and available equipment on the
    installation. Commanders ensure that operators are fully trained to complete their assigned missions.
    Training is provided to HN military and civilian work forces and U.S. contractors on the installation.
    2-68. To ensure an effective response, an installation-wide, cross-functional training program is
    implemented. Thorough training is required to prepare individuals and emergency teams to safely and
    efficiently respond to an incident at their required level of proficiency.
    2-69. The implementation of a strong IEM training program creates awareness across the installation and
    enhances the skills of individuals with assigned EM functions or responsibilities. The active use of such
    readily available training and educational materials also helps ensure an appropriate level of competency of
    installation commanders, responders, technicians, specialists, and the base population.
    2-70. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, the lead functional area for each mission-essential task tracks and
    reports the training provided to personnel. Reporting is consistent with DODD 7730.65 and may be
    augmented by DOD component-specific policies and procedures.
    2-71. Numerous courses and training opportunities are available from various government and private
    sources. The installation emergency manager can tailor program training needs to meet specific mission
    requirements. Minimum training requirements for general all-hazards awareness, EM personnel, and first
    responders at all levels of the management structure can be found in DODI 6055.17.

EXERCISES
    2-72. Education and training are not enough to prepare an installation for an incident. The use of realistic
    exercises ensures that the installation is prepared for, and can efficiently conduct operations under,
    emergency conditions. Exercises are conducted at regular periodicity as directed.
    2-73. Exercises are conducted according to DODI 6055.17. Examples of guidance and information found
    in this reference include—
               A capability gap analysis.
               A response capability assessment.
               Frequency and functional requirements for exercise design and execution.
               An exercise evaluation.
               Corrective-action mechanisms.
    2-74. Exercises include participants from all emergency response functions on the installation and, when
    possible, from appropriate tenants and local, state, federal, and HN participants using existing support
    agreements to ensure the proper integration into the IEM plan. Each exercise includes realistic scenarios
    that the installation could face based on the current hazard assessment. Each exercise is designed to
    evaluate specific critical missions or tasks within the overall training scenario.
    2-75. When appropriate, installations located outside the United States align their installation exercise and
    training schedules with those of the combatant commander, the HN, and the Department of State (DOS).
    Installations located within the United States consider aligning their installation exercise and training
    schedules with those of the Department of Justice, the DHS, and state and local preparedness programs, as
    appropriate. Such synchronized training and exercise opportunities will further foster well-synchronized
    responses to IEM incidents.
    2-76. Each exercise provides realistic master scenario event lists that exercise each element of the
    installation emergency response plan. Unexpected challenges (such as disabling key personnel and
    equipment) are included to assess the resiliency of the response process.
    2-77. Tabletop exercises can be used to provide installation leadership and staff with opportunities to war-
    game multiple scenarios. Tabletop training exercises are specifically designed to train leaders to execute
    critical missions and critical collective tasks.


26 April 2013                 ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                             2-13
Chapter 2



       2-78. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, ensure that all members of the installation exercise evaluation team
       are familiar with the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP). HSEEP is a
       capability- and performance-based exercise program that provides a standardized methodology and
       terminology for exercise design, development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning.
       Information on HSEEP courses is available online at <https://hseep.dhs.gov/pages/1001_HSEEP7.aspx>.

EVALUATION
       2-79. A critical weakness in training and exercises is the failure to evaluate each task every time it is
       executed. Every training opportunity or exercise provides the potential for evaluation feedback. Each
       evaluation is a training session. Trainers and leaders continually evaluate training and exercises as they are
       executed to ensure an optimized training and exercise program.
       2-80. Evaluations can be internal or external:
                Internal evaluations are conducted at all levels and are implemented into all training and
                 exercises. Installation exercise evaluation teams are established to conduct these internal
                 evaluations.
                External evaluations are administered at the discretion of the chain of command to evaluate its
                 ability to perform critical response missions.

SUMMARY
       2-81. Consistent with NIMS, preparedness consists of the activities, tasks, programs, and systems
       developed and implemented before an emergency that are used to support the prevention of, mitigation of,
       response to, and recovery from emergencies. These activities can include developing plans and SOPs;
       assessing and managing risk by conducting hazard assessments and VAs; coordinating functional
       responsibilities throughout the installation enterprise; and implementing training, exercise, and evaluation
       procedures.

                                              Respond
        Response operations consist of the actions taken from the initial notification of a
        potential or actual incident until the transition to the recovery phase. Each installation
        response occurs under different circumstances, but follows the common framework
        and incident command structure under NIMS and the NRF, regardless of the type of
        incident. An installation response depends on whether the installation is in a
        peacetime or contingency environment, what organic resources are available, what
        resources must be obtained from off the installation, and what threats currently face
        the installation.

        Note. U.S. Air Force (USAF) installations employ the Air Force Incident Management
        System when responding to all-hazards incidents. The Air Force Incident Management
        System is consistent with the framework of NIMS and the NRF.

COMMAND AND CONTROL
    3-3. Command and control of the response phase follows the NRF/NIMS framework for the
    establishment and execution of command functions during a response. Key command elements in a
    response are discussed in the following sections.

INITIAL RESPONSE ACTIONS
    3-4. The initial response phase includes—
            An initial observation and report by the person who discovered the incident.
            The establishment of command and control.
            Mass, internal, and external notifications.
            Immediate and continuous health and safety protection actions.
            Immediate and continuous evaluations of the safety of possible responses.
            Immediate steps to control the source of the hazard, when applicable.
            The activation of local response resources.
            A constant assessment of the situation and maintenance of SA.
    3-5. The initial IC usually manages the response by using a series of informal meetings and conversations
    to gather information from the initial response team and provide response guidance.
    3-6. Depending on the size or impact of the incident, demands on the IC can increase quickly and
    additional personnel can be assigned to critical tracking and communications functions. These initial
    assignments form the core of a response management organization, performing crucial ICS functions even
    before a formal ICS process is initiated. If the initial IC determines that an expanded ICS organization will
    be needed to manage the response, an incident briefing will end the initial response phase.

          Note. The USAF utilizes an initial response force, which is the nearest military installation that
          has a disaster response capability to a major accident involving DOD resources. The Air Force
          initial response force responds unless directed otherwise. Subject to its capabilities, the initial
          response force may be tasked to perform rescue operations; accident site security; firefighting;
          EOD procedures; radiation monitoring; command, control, and communications operations;
          public affairs activities; and casualty management.


INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM
    3-7. The ICS is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazards incident management approach that—
            Allows for the integration of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications
             operating within a common organizational structure.
            Enables a coordinated response among various jurisdictions and functional agencies, both public
             and private.
            Establishes common processes for planning and managing resources.

          Note. For details on the ICS TTP, see appendix D.

    3-8. The ICS is used throughout the United States and is the recognized standard for on-scene incident
    management. The ICS is specifically designed to allow response agencies to adopt an integrated,
    organizational structure equal to the complexity and demand of single or multiple incidents without being
    hindered by jurisdictional boundaries.
    3-9. As outlined in DODI 6055.17, DOD installations have adopted procedures consistent with ICS
    principles for the management of emergencies covered by the DOD IEM program. Agencies use the system
    on a day-to-day basis for routine situations and for major emergencies.




26 April 2013                 ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                 3-3
Chapter 3



      3-10. There are two functional centers on the installation during an incident response. They are the incident
      command post (ICP) and the EOC:
               ICP. The ICP is responsible for on-scene response activities and is under the direction of the IC.
                The IC reports to the installation commander.
               EOC. The EOC is responsible for the entire installation-wide response to the event and provides
                overall command and control (on behalf of the installation commander) of the incident.

            Note. USAF organizations employ a third command and control node. This command and
            control node includes the installation commander and key staff and is called the crisis action
            team, which operates out of the ICP. This vital command and control node links ongoing
            incident response actions with the execution of the installation mission operations and maintains
            vital linkage with higher headquarters.

      3-11. Figure 3-2 details the notional interfaces among the installation commander, the IC, the ICP, on-
      scene operations, and the EOC. The ICP and the EOC are discussed in detail in the following text.




                                           Figure 3-2. ICS interface

INCIDENT COMMAND POST
      3-12. When an incident occurs, trained installation personnel initiate the ICS and establish an ICP for on-
      site response. The ICP is the tactical-level, on-scene incident command and management organization and
      is typically located at, or in the immediate vicinity of, the incident site.
      3-13. Initial safety zones for the establishment of an ICP are defined in the most recent version of the
      Department of Transportation Emergency Response Guidebook. The Emergency Response Guidebook
      Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances provides first responders with initial guidance
      until technically qualified emergency response personnel are available. Distances from the area of impact
      show areas likely to be affected during the first 30 minutes after materials are spilled. The size of these
      areas could increase with time.

                                                                                                         Respond



    3-14. The senior installation first responder on the scene of an incident who has the requisite training
    implements the ICS. The responder assumes the role of the IC and is responsible for directing and
    controlling resources by virtue of explicit legal, agency, or delegated authority. As the installation response
    further progresses, the role of the IC may change hands as more qualified first responders arrive on-scene
    or are appointed by the installation commander. At some point, a UC may be established depending on the
    magnitude of the event or an incident of national significance.

          Note. USAF installations employ fire emergency services as the IC for an incident involving two
          or more response agencies. Security or medical forces may function as the IC when an incident
          or accident involves only a medical or security response.

    3-15. The IC is responsible for all aspects of the response, including developing incident objectives and
    managing incident operations. The IC sets priorities and defines the ICS organization for the particular
    response. Even if other positions are not assigned, the IC is designated. The IC may assign deputies, who
    must have the same qualifications as the person for whom they work, as they must be ready to take over the
    IC position at any time.

          Note. The IC is solely the tactical commander of the incident and is in charge of running the
          response and initial recovery for the event. The command of the installation remains with the
          installation commander throughout the incident, and the installation commander is ultimately
          responsible for all efforts on the installation.


EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER
    3-16. EOCs have SOPs for monitoring incident development. They provide the following functions,
    consistent with DODI 6055.17:
              COP. The EOC uses a COP and incident management system to execute and support actions
               required by the IEM plan and to facilitate the coordination of incident information.
              Interoperable communications. The EOC ensures interoperable communications that support
               the first responder and first receiver missions of the Service component and are encouraged to
               ensure interoperable communications with civil authorities.
              Mass warning and notification. DOD installations maintain mass warning and notification
               capabilities to warn personnel immediately, but no longer than 10 minutes after incident
               notification and verification.
              Continuous warning point. The heads of the DOD components ensure a continuous capability
               that serves as the contact or warning point for emergency situations.
    3-17. The EOC functions as an ICS liaison who coordinates support for the IC/ICP in all functional areas
    and follow-on elements. The EOC controls functional-area response and installation support elements so
    that taskings or requests from the incident site are supported, and it keeps higher headquarters informed.
    Each installation EOC is NIMS-compliant while using the incident or UC system organizational structure
    to provide a collaboration point and operations center for installation staff. The EOC supports the execution
    of the IEM plan, the installation AT plan, other supporting plans, DSCA missions, operational/contingency
    plans of assigned unit commanders, and the NRF.
    3-18. Just as every incident will not require the activation of the EOC, not every EOC activation will
    invoke the full range of EOC capabilities. EOC activation levels (partial or full) can be scaled based on the
    scope of the incident and the extent to which the EOC was already activated at the time of the incident. (For
    example, if the EOC is already in a warm status of activation due to an exercise at the time of the incident.)
    For more details on the TTP of the EOC, see appendix D.

MULTIAGENCY COORDINATION SYSTEM
    3-19. As defined in NIMS, the Multiagency Coordination System is a combination of facilities, equipment,
    personnel, procedures, and communications integrated into a common system with responsibility for
    coordinating and supporting domestic-incident management activities. The Mulitagency Coordination


26 April 2013                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                               3-5
Chapter 3



      System is focused on strategic and operational tasks at the installation level and on the support of the IC.
      The primary Multiagency Coordination System functions are to support incident management policies and
      priorities; facilitate logistics support and resource tracking; inform resource allocation decisions using
      incident management priorities; manage incident-related information; and coordinate interagency and
      intergovernmental issues regarding incident management policies, priorities, and strategies. The
      Multiagency Coordination System provides central locations for operational information sharing and
      resource coordination in support of on-scene efforts. Direct tactical and operational responsibility for
      conducting incident management activities at the tactical level remains with the IC.

DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES
      3-20. All DOD directives should be consulted before support is provided to civilian authorities. Usually,
      the response to an emergency in the local community is the responsibility of local and state governments.
      Military response occurs—
                At the direction of the governor of the affected state for state National Guard forces.
                Upon declaration by the President as requested by the governor of the affected state.
                At the direction of Service secretaries for capabilities not assigned to geographic combatant
                 commanders (bases, installations).
                Through immediate response authority.
      3-21. Consistent with DODI 3020.52 and DODD 3025.18, the DOD, because of its capabilities and
      resources, may be requested through established channels to provide temporary, short-duration emergency
      support to civil authorities during an emergency when local and state resources have been overwhelmed
      and RFAs have been submitted by civilian authorities via the procedures detailed in the NRF.
      3-22. Consistent with DODD 3025.18, federal military commanders, heads of DOD components, and
      responsible DOD civilian officials (referred to collectively as DOD officials) have immediate response
      authority. “A Federal military commander’s, DOD Component Head’s, and/or responsible DOD civilian
      official’s authority temporarily to employ resources under their control, subject to any supplemental
      direction provided by higher headquarters, and provide those resources to save lives, prevent human
      suffering, or mitigate great property damage in response to a request for assistance from a civil authority,
      under imminently serious conditions when time does not permit approval from a higher authority within the
      United States. Immediate response authority does not permit actions that would subject civilians to the use
      of military power that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory.”
      3-23. There are several statutory authorities that DOD may use to provide support and be reimbursed.
      These are detailed in JP 3-28, but the Homeland Security Act and the Stafford Act are discussed below:
               Homeland Security Act. The Homeland Security Act was amended with respect to the
                organization and mission of the FEMA in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations
                Act and established DHS as an executive department of the United States. The Homeland
                Security Act consolidated component agencies, including FEMA, into the DHS. The Secretary
                of Homeland Security is the head of DHS and has direction, authority, and control over it. All
                functions of all officers, employees, and organizational units of DHS are vested in the Secretary.
               Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The Robert T. Stafford
                Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act was also amended in the Department of
                Homeland Security Appropriations Act. It describes the programs and processes by which the
                federal government provides disaster and emergency assistance to state and local governments,
                tribal nations, eligible private nonprofit organizations, and individuals affected by a declared
                major disaster or emergency. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
                Act covers all hazards, including natural disasters and terrorist events.
               Posse Comitatus Act. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits federal, state, and local authorities
                from using Title 10 forces for any direct civil LE activities unless a constitutional or act of
                Congress exception applies. The Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit federal forces from
                assisting state and local organizations with humanitarian disaster relief.

                                                                                                          Respond



    3-24. Overseas installations coordinate their efforts with the supported geographic combatant command
    and, consistent with geographic combatant command guidance and DODD 5530.3, with appropriate DOS
    officials and HNs. DSCA does not apply to support in response to foreign disasters. (Refer to DODD
    5100.46 and JP 3-29.) All international agreements comply with the procedures and regulations outlined in
    DODD 5530.03.
    3-25. DOD units supporting an installation emergency response will be under the command and control of
    defense authorities, yet they may work in support of the civil authorities assisting the installation. The legal
    considerations for emergency response on an installation are complex and vary by the location, affected
    area, and incident type. Commanders consult their legal staff at the beginning of the planning process to
    incorporate, understand, and train staffs and responders on the limitations that a particular installation
    might face.

INTEGRATION OF SUPPORT ACTIVITIES
    3-26. As outlined in DODI 6055.17 and the NRF, ESFs organize and provide structure to federal
    interagency emergency response activities. Installations apply the ESF structure or equivalent functional
    area structure to installation emergency planning. Installations have the latitude to choose an organizational
    structure other than ESFs to provide functional area support to the emergency response effort. Details on
    the ESFs are provided in the NRF and appendix C. Appendix C also contains guidance for using functional
    areas in lieu of the ESF structure.
    3-27. The following ESFs are outlined in the NRF:
             Transportation.
             Communications.
             Public works and engineering.
             Firefighting.
             EM.
             Mass care, emergency assistance, housing, and human services.
             Logistics management and resource support.
             Public health and medical services.
             Search and rescue.
             Oil and HAZMAT response.
             Agriculture and natural resources.
             Energy.
             Public safety and security.
             Long-term community recovery.
             External affairs.
    3-28. The support functions of communications and resource management are integral to the operation of
    the EOC and are major, overarching components of NIMS. They are therefore discussed in more detail
    below and in appendixes E and F, respectively. Appendix G contains a sample MAA support agreement,
    while appendix H contains TTP on the support function for evacuation, shelter in place, and lockdown.
    Appendix I contains TTP for the mass care support function.

COMMUNICATIONS
    3-29. Communication needs during a response span from communicating with and among responders to
    communicating emergency information to the installation community. The following elements of
    communication are critical to ensuring timely, widespread, accurate information delivery throughout the
    response effort.




26 April 2013                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                3-7
Chapter 3



EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION
      3-30. The construction and delivery of emergency public information (EPI) throughout an incident is
      critical in creating and maintaining a resilient, trusting, empowered, and cooperative installation
      community. The delivery of key EPI messages begins immediately after an incident occurs (as vetted
      through the public affairs officer in the EOC, through the joint information center, or at higher
      headquarters) and continues throughout response and recovery.
      3-31. EPI is an ongoing process throughout all phases of EM and is designed to engage and inform
      personnel potentially affected by an emergency. EPI is typically implemented through the use of a joint
      information center.
      3-32. In coordination with local civil jurisdictions, installation commanders preselect at least one primary
      and one alternate site near the installation for the establishment of a joint information center. The preferable
      site for a joint information center, in order to support joint and interagency staffing with federal, state,
      local, and other authorities, is outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the installation. Locating the joint
      information center outside installation boundaries is necessary to preserve the adequate exchange of public
      information when and if the installation is closed to the public during an emergency.
      3-33. The requirement for EPI does not end immediately after termination of the response phase of an
      incident. There is a continued need to exchange information with the full range of affected public during
      the recovery phase. Installations continue communication during recovery operations by providing
      pertinent information, such as conveying the impact and analyses of the incident. Additionally, installations
      provide opportunities for stakeholders to submit information on community impacts, lessons learned, and
      other relevant information from the community, supporting local, state, and federal agencies; the media;
      and members of the general public.
      3-34. Providing pertinent information and assistance to military members, civilian employees, and their
      families is extremely important. Military personnel will be better able to concentrate on mission recovery if
      they are confident that their family needs (medical, housing, legal, counseling, pet care, food, clothing) are
      being met. The primary method of providing this assistance is to activate an emergency family assistance
      control center or similar assistance center. This serves as the focal point for family assistance services and
      operates in conjunction with the installation EOC and appropriate ESFs and functional areas.
      3-35. Using current guidelines, the installation can leverage social media to convey information and
      monitor message response. Appendix E provides additional information regarding all aspects of
      communications TTP, including EPI.

COMMON OPERATIONAL PICTURE
      3-36. During the response phase, a COP is established to provide the installation commander and his staff
      with a quick, timely, usable, precise, and reliable view of the status of an incident. As explained in DODI
      6055.17, the COP provides consistency at all levels of incident management across jurisdictions, as well as
      between various governmental jurisdictions and private-sector and nongovernmental entities.
      3-37. The COP is capable of supporting all aspects of response operations (hazard locations, evacuation or
      shelter-in-place requirements and locations, unit response capabilities, unit exposure status, updated risk
      assessments) to the greatest extent possible. To be effective, the COP is constantly updated during the
      response phase.
      3-38. A key benefit of a good COP system is that it allows the installation to quickly relay to its tenant and
      transient units the identical, graphic display of relevant information for SA. The same information can be
      relayed to local officials. In the case of foreign operations, it is feasible that U.S. embassy personnel could
      relay these details to HN representatives as appropriate. Thus, a good COP facilitates collaborative
      planning throughout the response effort.




3-8                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                 26 April 2013
                                                                                                       Respond



INCIDENT REPORTING
    3-39. Incident reporting and documentation procedures are standardized to ensure that SA is maintained
    and that EM and response personnel have easy access to critical information. Detailed instructions for
    operational and situation reports can be found in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Manual
    3150.05C.
    3-40. Situation reports offer a snapshot of the past operational period and contain confirmed or verified
    information regarding the explicit details (who, what, when, where, how) relating to the incident. Status
    reports, which may be contained in situation reports, relay information specifically related to the status of
    resources (such as the availability or assignment of resources).
    3-41. The information contained in incident notification, situation, and status reports is standardized to
    facilitate processing without preventing the collection or dissemination of information unique to a reporting
    organization. The transmission of data in a common format enables the passing of pertinent information to
    appropriate jurisdictions and organizations and to a national system that can handle data queries and
    information and intelligence assessments and analysis.

MASS WARNING AND NOTIFICATION
    3-42. DODI 6055.17 directs installations to develop mass warning and notification capabilities to warn
    personnel immediately, but no longer than 10 minutes after incident notification and verification. The mass
    warning and notification gives response direction using intelligible voice communications, visible signals,
    texts, text messaging, computer notification, and tactile or other communication methods. Mass warning
    TTP are outlined in appendix E.
    3-43. Based on the Report of the DOD Independent Review (Protecting the Force: Lessons from Fort
    Hood) and the resulting Secretary of Defense memo (Final Recommendations of the Fort Hood Follow-on
    Review), DODI 6055.17 requires mass notification and warning systems to be a required capability for
    installations to achieve IEM full operational capability. Existing and future elements may include—
               A giant voice for outdoor areas.
               In-building speaker systems.
               Telephone alert systems for phone calls and text alerts.
               Software alert systems for computer and e-mail alerts.

DISPATCH/EMERGENCY CONTROL/EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS
    3-44. The installation dispatch or emergency communications center provides emergency call taking; alarm
    monitoring; sensor monitoring; video monitoring and control; communications support; channel, frequency
    assignments, and allocation; and emergency notification to response personnel. In some cases, these
    services are provided regionally or in collaboration with civil authorities.
    3-45. DODI 6055.17 requires a capability for enhanced 9-1-1 service on the installation. Enhanced 9-1-1 is
    a telephone system consisting of network, database, and enhanced 9-1-1 equipment that uses the single
    three-digit number for reporting police, fire, medical, or other emergency situations to a central location,
    while automatically associating a physical address with the telephone number of the calling party.
    3-46. The 9-1-1 systems are interoperable with civilian authorities to allow incoming and outgoing
    transfers of voice and location data. Dispatch centers include capabilities for interoperable communication,
    weather monitoring, mass warning system control, and COP system access. Dispatch centers may also
    include capabilities for the provision of emergency medical dispatch instructions and monitoring of the
    National Warning System.
    3-47. The IEM program coordinates plans with the responsible office for the dispatch function to ensure
    that emergency notifications to responders are communicated in a timely manner. The dispatch center is
    included in IEM exercises and training events as appropriate.




26 April 2013                 ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              3-9
Chapter 3



RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
       3-48. Resource management occurs at all levels in support of incident management. Installation resources
       supply assets for installation level response efforts and potentially provide support for incident support base
       and JRSOI missions. Support agreements are in place in advance of an event and are enacted during an
       event as needed to maintain supplies.

SUPPLY AND LOGISTICS
       3-49. Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date picture of resource availability and utilization is a critical
       component of resource management. Resource management includes processes for categorizing, ordering,
       dispatching, tracking, and recovering resources. Resource management also includes processes for the
       reimbursement of resources, as appropriate.
       3-50. As outlined in NIMS, incident management personnel use various resource inventory systems to
       assess the availability of assets provided by public, private, and volunteer organizations. Installation
       emergency managers are responsible for the consolidation of resource inventory entries and submissions by
       assigned ESFs or functional areas. ESFs or functional areas on installations are responsible for entering the
       resources available for deployment into the resource inventory maintained at the installation. This resource
       data is made available to the supporting installation dispatch center and installation EOC. ESFs or
       functional areas are also responsible for resource and financial management related to life cycle
       management of assigned resources. For more information regarding resource management and resource
       typing, see appendix F.

INCIDENT SUPPORT BASE
       3-51. Installations selected as an incident support bases are expected to continue military mission
       operations, in addition to those imposed by the incident support base mission. Installation commanders are
       prepared to request personnel, material, and equipment augmentation as necessary. As explained in the
       CJCS DSCA Executive Order and U.S. Northern Command Concept Plan 3501, incident support base
       support is temporary in nature and uses resources not required for the preparation or conduct of military
       operations.
       3-52. The term incident support base is now used by DHS and FEMA to replace the previous terms of base
       support installation, operational staging area, national logistics staging area, and mobilization site.
       Consistent with DODD 3025.18 and JP 3-28, an incident support base is a DOD installation that provides
       specified, integrated resource support to the DSCA.
       3-53. Incident support base requirements from the CJCS DSCA Executive Order, the U.S. Northern
       Command Concept Plan 3501, JP 3-41, and JP 3-28 state that an incident support base is a DOD
       installation or leased facility of any DOD component which is in or near an actual or projected domestic
       operational area and which has the capability to serve in general support of DOD forces involved in civil
       disaster response operations.
       3-54. The designation as an incident support base may require the installation to provide one or more
       installation support roles, including ports of embarkation, ports of debarkation, intermediate staging bases,
       and/or forward operating bases. Consistent with DODD 3025.18 and JP 3-28, incident support bases have
       the following capabilities:
                  Close proximity to the incident site (less than 100 miles).
                  Close proximity to a major airfield.
                  Life support services (billeting, food service, fuel, contracting, medical support, FP).
                  Open and covered areas for the staging of supplies and equipment.
                  Adequate transportation network to and from the incident site.
                  Communications infrastructure sufficient to meet the surge of forces arriving in the area.
       3-55. Depending on the nature and scope of assets organic to an installation, the installation may or may
       not be requested to provide support in the form of an incident support base. However, every installation
       commander is aware of the assets that may be requested of their installation in this event. In addition,

    installation commanders understand the planning considerations for an installation to function as an
    incident support base. Consistent with DODD 3025.18 and JP 3-28, incident support base planning
    considerations take into account key functions of logistics for operations, including—
               A concise concept of purpose and a description of the functions that the installation will support.
               The forces required to support the operation and phasing for the induction of logistic elements.
               A joint field office in the affected area.
               A FEMA mobilization location.
               The length of time that the installation will provide support.
               Transportation suitability.
               Adequate supply, maintenance, transportation, civil engineering, medical, and other service
                support on the installation.

          Note. For more details and a checklist on incident support base planning considerations, see JP
          3-41.

    3-56. To maximize the economy of force and to focus the response force on DSCA operations, the incident
    support base is responsible for the JRSOI of forces flowing through the incident support base, as described
    in detail below. JRSOI requirements are detailed in the mission assignment so that installations can
    determine their ability to provide support.

JOINT RECEPTION, STAGING, ONWARD MOVEMENT, AND INTEGRATION
    3-57. JRSOI is the critical link between the deployment and employment of response forces in an
    operational area. The reception of forces and the subsequent staging at the incident support base are key to
    the JRSOI.
    3-58. Consistent with JP 3-41, the deploying force (usually a joint task force) utilizes organic assets when
    possible to assist and expedite reception and staging operations. Depending on the size and scope of the
    deploying response force, the incident support base may require additional equipment and personnel with
    specialized capabilities to conduct JRSOI. Installations identify shortfalls in equipment, personnel, and
    other resources through their operational chain of command. Special requirements of the deploying force
    (such as armory or kennel services or classified material storage) are coordinated early in the planning
    process to ensure their availability.
    3-59. An incident support base may be tasked to support the medium- to large-scale staging of logistics
    assets, including tractor trailers, portable facilities, and supply and logistic centers. An incident support
    base may also be tasked to support the forward staging (mobilization site) of manpower and ground/air/sea
    transportation assets for direct movement to the emergency site in place of the staging of heavy logistic
    assets and depots.
    3-60. IEM programs facilitate the planning for, preparing for, developing required capabilities for, and
    supporting JRSOI during DSCA. However, the decision to designate an installation as an incident support
    base or to provide support to JRSOI is dependent on whether or not the installation has the organic
    capability to support those needs. The installation does not preplan for such a response until a standing
    executive order directs the installation to do so.

ACTIVATION OF SUPPORT AGREEMENTS
    3-61. Support agreements are activated through predetermined activation and reporting mechanisms to
    meet the needs of the emergency incident. These agreements may be activated through the EOC or by the
    on-scene IC as outlined by the agreement and IEM plan.
    3-62. IEM plans include procedures for the eventual demobilization of supplied resources through existing
    support agreements.

SUMMARY
       3-63. An incident may begin with or without a warning period; for example, an approaching hurricane
       versus a sudden earthquake. As soon as an incident or the threat of an incident occurs, EM operations shift
       from the planning and preparation mode to the response mode. When an incident or event begins, the
       execution of NIMS and ICS procedures allows for a coordinated, interoperable, and expandable response
       structure on and off the installation. The IC directs on-scene response activities from the ICP and reports to
       the installation commander. The EOC manages support operations on behalf of the installation commander.
       The coordination and integration of support activities, especially communications and resource
       management, are integral to an efficient and effective incident response effort.

                                               Recover
        There often is no distinct break between the time that response operations end and
        recovery operations begin. Recovery often begins while response operations are still
        in progress. In addition, recovery activities often extend long after the initial incident
        response phase is complete. Short-term recovery actions seek to restore essential
        services and ensure that the immediate needs of the impacted installation community
        are met. Longer-term recovery actions include fully restoring remaining noncritical
        operations, rebuilding destroyed property, and reconstituting other noncritical
        services. The main goal of recovery is mission reconstitution and the restoration of
        essential operations.

RECOVERY MANAGEMENT
      4-3. In part, the NRF defines recovery as “ … the development, coordination, and execution of service-
      and site-restoration plans; the reconstitution of government operations and services; individual, private-
      sector, nongovernmental, and public-assistance programs to provide housing and to promote restoration;
      long-term care and treatment of affected persons; additional measures for social, political, environmental,
      and economic restoration; evaluation of the incident to identify lessons learned; postincident reporting; and
      development of initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents.”
      4-4. The primary tasks of an installation during the initial recovery phase are to complete any remaining
      mitigation of the immediate hazard and finish restoring mission capability and essential public and
      government services interrupted by an event. The primary tasks of an installation during long-term
      recovery are to restore full operations and public services and to rebuild destroyed property.

RECOVERY WORKING GROUP
      4-5. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, the installation commander establishes a recovery working group
      early in the recovery phase of every emergency where recovery operations require coordination in the
      judgment of the installation commander. The recovery working group is preidentified for likely events
      within the IEM plans. The recovery working group is a task-organized working group focused on the
      evaluation, prioritization, and coordination of recovery requirements. The recovery working group, with the
      technical direction of the installation emergency manager and the installation public works/civil
      engineering representative, conducts recovery planning at the installation level.

RECOVERY PLANNING
      4-7. During the recovery phase, additional information is obtained and a recovery plan is developed and
      implemented. The recovery plan provides detailed, incident-specific procedures for short-term and long-
      term recovery. The EOC uses the IEM plan to assist in developing a detailed recovery plan based on
      damage assessment information and priorities established by the installation commander.
      4-8. While the IEM plan facilitates response and short-term recovery, the recovery plan provides detailed,
      incident-specific processes and procedures, including the immediate restoration of transportation and
      communication capabilities, search and rescue operations, utility reconstruction, community reconstruction,
      site remediation, medical care or mitigation, and other activities necessary for successful long-term
      recovery.
      4-9. During the transition to follow-on operations, the installation commander balances between focusing
      resources on mission-essential tasks versus completing recovery tasks. Limitations of resources require
      installation decisionmakers to prioritize and concentrate on the tasks needed to recover installation missions
      and operations to full capability.




26 April 2013                    ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              4-3
Chapter 4



      4-10. As in the response phase, an up-to-date COP is invaluable during the recovery phase for providing
      the installation commander and his staff with a quick, timely, usable, precise, and reliable view of the status
      of an incident. During the recovery phase, the COP is capable of supporting all aspects of the recovery
      operations (hazard locations, unit response capabilities, unit exposure status, updated risk assessments).
      4-11. Long-term recovery after a major event usually takes years to complete. Installation commanders
      establish recovery priorities consistent with the installation mission. Consideration is given to operational
      mission priorities and the reestablishment of the normal operating environment, as well as activities such as
      housing/facility construction, transportation restoration, community reconstruction, environmental
      remediation, and continued delivery of EPI.

SUSTAINMENT AND RESTORATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND
OPERATIONS
      4-12. The restoration of the installation infrastructure involves coordination with the installation public
      works department and civilian jurisdiction service providers, public or private. IEM programs coordinate
      infrastructure recovery plans before an incident to effectively restore infrastructure after the incident
      occurs.
      4-13. The restoration, in concert with mission continuation tasks, officially begins when the IC advises the
      EOC director that the incident has been sufficiently controlled or terminated and the security of the
      situation is sufficient to begin restoration activity. Consequently, the EOC directs and coordinates
      infrastructure recovery inspections and reports damage by using “quick looks” and detailed assessments.
      4-14. The damage assessment and impact analysis are essential to determining the magnitude, scope, scale,
      and extent of an emergency. Damage assessment results guide the determination of priorities, identification
      of required resources, and justification for assistance and supplemental funding requests. The public works
      asset may conduct physical damage assessments, if such a capability exists within the installation.
      Installations establish processes for damage assessment and debris clearance. These capabilities support
      short-term (less than 2 weeks in duration) recovery efforts and initial damage assessments, resource
      projections, and recovery planning requirements. The damage assessment process begins as soon as
      possible after an incident occurs to assess the level of human suffering and infrastructure impacts and
      continues throughout the recovery phase.
      4-15. A reliable, rapid field damage assessment increases the likelihood that recovery funds and other
      resources are properly prioritized and targeted. Damage assessments also provide policymakers with
      guidance for planning and implementing mitigation measures. The field-based assessment acts as ground
      truth for larger, more comprehensive assessments, such as satellite-based assessments. The objective of
      rapid field damage assessments is to get a quick, reliable overview of the following damage-related issues:
                 Is there damage to the environment?
                 What is the damage to utilities and other supportive infrastructure?
                 Are there impacts to livelihood because of the damage?
                 What role, if any, did preincident mitigation measures play in reducing the impact of the
                  incident, and under what circumstances and to what extent did this occur?
      4-16. After basic reconstruction activities have been completed, the long-term process of recovery begins.
      Restoration decisions focus installation resources on critical and essential operations and infrastructure,
      including maintaining safety, preventing the further loss of combat power, maintaining or restoring
      installation integrity and security, restoring command and control over forces, restoring the primary
      mission, and supporting other forces. Restoration capabilities include measures required to restore the
      force, units, facilities, and equipment to near-normal operating conditions after a major accident or natural
      disaster. These measures include decontamination operations and the effective supply and sustainment of
      response assets.
      4-17. Restoration actions, in progress or intended, are recorded and are a part of the recovery plan. From
      this record, several actions are enabled. Those actions include estimating repair costs and determining
      whether the repairs will be accomplished in-house or by contract, estimating the recovery date and time,

    ascertaining required assistance, and assessing the impact on the combat readiness status of installation
    forces.

MASS CARE
    4-18. Care for the base populace during recovery includes providing temporary housing and behavioral
    health and counseling services. Detailed TTP for mass care are included in Appendix H, but the
    fundamentals are discussed below.

HOUSING OPERATIONS
    4-19. Temporary housing is where displaced personnel live from the time they leave a safe haven or
    civilian shelter until the time they return to their previous home or a new home. Temporary housing is in a
    livable condition; has sufficient utilities and services; is pest-, mold-, and mildew-free; and is properly
    prepared (ventilated and cleaned) by safe-haven residents before occupancy. Before occupancy, personnel
    need to fully understand the rules, timelines, and responsibilities concerning the use of temporary housing,
    such as the expected occupancy time, financial responsibilities (utilities, damages, supplies, appliances),
    general logistics (parking, utilities, supplies, quiet hours), and expected behavior. Examples of temporary
    housing include barracks, dormitories, bachelor quarters, visitors quarters, previously available family
    housing units, recreational lodging, hotels, rented apartments or homes in the local economy, mobile
    homes, and vacation properties. The coordination of temporary housing needs is the responsibility of the
    installation housing office in support of the recovery working group. Temporary housing needs for pets is
    also considered and identified.
    4-20. Installations should not rush into permanent housing solutions until a revised community profile has
    been completed and the installation has the infrastructure and services necessary to support the estimated
    population. It is important to address changes in the installation populace, especially designated place
    relocations, during this process.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELING
    4-21. A critical recovery operation that is often overlooked during the planning process is the provision of
    behavioral health and counseling services to anyone affected by the incident in the installation community.
    This important process begins the day of the incident and remains ongoing until full recovery is established.
    The behavioral health and well-being of the installation community is the most vital component to a
    complete and sustainable recovery effort.

DEBRIS CLEARANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION
    4-22. Installations establish contracting vehicles to be used for debris clearance and environmental
    remediation in the event of an incident requiring these services. These contracts include, but are not limited
    to, MAA/MOU/MOA/ISSAs, indefinite quantity contracts, the logistics civil augmentation program, and
    the emergency construction capabilities contract. Contracts should not be limited to local vendors or
    commands, because these capabilities may be lost or overtasked during an emergency.
    4-23. The debris management process begins as soon as possible after an incident occurs to permit access
    to the incident site by designated personnel, to remove life safety and environmental hazards, and to
    mitigate further environmental contamination throughout the recovery phase. Debris management
    capabilities at an installation may be restricted by safety considerations and may be limited to providing
    initial clearance operations and consolidating debris at one or more sites.
    4-24. Remediation begins upon the completion of a contamination survey and continues until all
    contamination has been removed or remediated. The scope and duration of the remediation depends on the
    agent or material. The postevent assessment includes medical, environmental, and public works.
    4-25. Remediation operations follow the neutralization and removal of CBRN contamination. Imminent
    threats to personnel or the environment are alleviated during neutralization or removal operations, so
    remediation operations normally take place in a nonemergency setting.



26 April 2013                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              4-5
Chapter 4



      4-26. Remediation is usually performed by civilian environmental consultant firms under contract to the
      Service or under the supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Energy,
      depending on the nature of the event. The identification, investigation, research, development, and cleanup
      of contamination from hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants are to be carried out subject to,
      and consistent with, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and
      other federal regulatory guidance.

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
      4-27. Recovery involves the final disposition of all resources. During this process, resources are
      rehabilitated, replenished, disposed of, and retrograded.
      4-28. While many recovery activities can occur by utilizing organic and precoordinated capabilities
      available to the installation, many longer-term recovery actions require external requests and coordination
      for assets unavailable to a typical installation command. Consistent with DODI 3020.52, installation
      commanders utilize reachback assets and support agreements to sustain and complete the recovery mission.
      4-29. Resource management in recovery continues to include processes for categorizing, ordering,
      dispatching, tracking, and demobilizing resources and personnel. Resource management during recovery
      may also include processes for the reimbursement for resources, as appropriate.
      4-30. Reimbursement provides a mechanism to fund critical needs that arise from incident-specific
      activities. Reimbursement processes also play an important role in establishing and maintaining the
      readiness of resources. Processes and procedures are in place to ensure that resource providers are
      reimbursed in a timely manner. These include mechanisms for tracking expenditures, collecting bills,
      validating costs against the scope of the work, ensuring that proper authorities are involved, and accessing
      reimbursement programs.
      4-31. Emergency cost accounting is a key function during an emergency. Emergency cost accounting can
      be accomplished by the IC or EOC finance and administration sections or by another installation entity
      after the EOC/IC are stood down. It is important to develop and standardize procedures to rapidly develop
      and manage emergency cost accounting codes to track emergency-related expenses, including those
      incurred under support agreements and support contracts. These emergency and special purpose codes are
      issued by a designated Service authority. It is also important to consolidate and forward cost estimates
      identified during the damage assessment process to the appropriate installation-owning command as
      directed. It is the responsibility of installation-owning commands to develop the overarching emergency
      funding lines necessary to consolidate multiple emergency cost account codes that may be in use by
      multiple installations at the same time.
      4-32. The installation business office or comptroller develops and approves procedures for expediting
      fiscal decisions during emergencies consistent with established authorization levels and fiscal policy. This
      framework provides for maximum flexibility to expediently request, receive, manage, and apply funds in a
      nonemergency environment and in emergency situations to ensure the timely delivery of assistance. The
      administrative process is documented through written procedures. The program is also capable of capturing
      financial data for future cost recovery, as well as identifying and accessing alternative funding sources and
      managing budgeted and specially appropriated funds.

MORTUARY AFFAIRS
      4-33. Fatality management is a medical function with a logistics component regarding the management,
      transportation, handling and, if necessary, temporary internment of human remains. Mortuary affairs is a
      larger function of identifying the human remains; notifying and assisting the family of the deceased;
      transporting the remains, if necessary; and conducting permanent interment. As discussed in DODI
      6055.17, IEM programs coordinate with the supporting MTF and their logistics lead on the availability and
      capabilities for fatality management.
      4-34. IEM plans include predetermined responsibilities and procedures for the identification,
      decontamination (if applicable), and handling of human remains, including mass fatality incidents. This

    may require support from the civilian medical examiner in the event that installation assets are
    overwhelmed.
    4-35. Consistent with JP 4-06, mortuary affairs support may be requested by civil authorities in the event
    of a mass casualty incident. The support provided by DOD mortuary affairs personnel is then tailored to the
    needs of the requesting authority. The request could vary from personnel transporting human remains, to an
    identification process, to a complete excavation of a disaster site.

PUBLIC HEALTH
    4-36. The public health of the protected populace requires continued monitoring and actions throughout
    recovery. Health risks, such as a lack of access to safe drinking water and safe and approved food sources
    and animal feed, can severely disrupt the recovery process. The core functions of public health are health
    risk assessment, risk mitigation, and communication of health risks to the public.
    4-37. Other public health considerations include—
             Establishing sanitary conditions for workers and residents.
             Establishing vector control of mosquitoes, rats, and other disease vectors.
             Managing mold and mildew assessments and removal operations necessary for housing
              reoccupation.
             Managing public health issues resulting from a lack of water treatment facilities.
             Managing wastewater pump and treatment operations.
             Managing solid waste collection and disposal operations.
             Continuing syndromic surveillance operations.
             Continuing medical surveillance of response personnel.
             Expanding coverage to include personnel injured or exposed to hazardous conditions during
              response and recovery operations.
             Coordinating with mortuary affairs for the safe handling of human remains.

SUMMARY
    4-38. Recovery is a long-term process that begins as an overlap with the response phase. Of the four
    phases, recovery is the most time- and resource-intensive. Depending on the nature of the incident, full
    community and economic recovery can take many months to many years and require significant budgetary
    expenditures. Prioritizing the tasks necessary to recoup losses will help with time and budget management
    as the installation commander and staff start down the long road to recovery.

                                               Mitigate
        Mitigation actions involve the lasting reduction of, exposure to, probability of, or
        potential loss from identified hazards. The goal of mitigation efforts is to reduce the
        impact of identified hazards on critical and essential operations, critical assets,
        critical infrastructure, essential services, assigned personnel, and government and
        personal property. Mitigation activities provide a critical foundation in the effort to
        reduce injuries and the loss of life and property from natural and/or manmade
        disasters by avoiding or lessening the impact of a disaster. Mitigation efforts are
        taken before and after an emergency and should be an ongoing process that feeds
        directly into the overall preparedness of the installation. Multiple functional areas
        execute mitigation tasks as a normal part of their operations.

ACTIONS

VULNERABILITY REDUCTION
      5-3. Vulnerability reduction tools assist in the identification of mitigation efforts that may negate or
      reduce the effects of identified hazards. Vulnerability reduction measures tie into the results from the risk
      management process that takes place throughout the EM cycle (see appendix B).
      5-4. Examples of vulnerability reduction and mitigation activities include—
             Understanding and complying with zoning and building code requirements for rebuilding in
              high-hazard areas.
             Creating inventories of existing structures and their vulnerabilities.
             Analyzing hazard-related data to determine where it is safe to build in normal times, to open
              shelters in emergencies, and to locate temporary housing in the aftermath of a disaster.
      5-5. Vulnerability reduction also can involve educating businesses and personnel on the measures that
      they can take to reduce loss and injury, such as fastening bookshelves, water heaters, and file cabinets to
      walls to keep them from falling during earthquakes.
      5-6. Key areas of concern regarding mitigation activities include—
              Utility systems, especially power and water treatment distribution.
              Dams and levees.
              Lightning and power surge protection.
              Landslide and mudslide containment structures.
              Earthquake retrofit requirements.
      5-7. Mitigation actions can be grouped into the following categories:
              Prevention. Prevention actions are the administrative or regulatory actions or processes that
               influence the ways in which land and buildings are developed and built. These actions also
               include public activities to reduce hazard losses. Examples include planning and zoning,

                                                                                                          Mitigate



                building codes, capital improvement programs, open space preservation, and storm water
                management regulations.
               Property protection. Property protection actions involve the modification of existing buildings
                or structures to protect them from a hazard or the removal of property from the hazard area.
                Examples include acquisition, elevation, relocation, structural retrofits, storm shutters, and
                shatter-resistant glass.
               Public education and awareness. Public education and awareness actions inform and educate
                the installation populace about hazards and potential ways to mitigate them. Such actions include
                outreach projects, hazard information centers, and school-age and adult education programs.
               Natural resource protection. In addition to minimizing hazard losses, natural resource
                protection actions preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. These actions include
                sediment and erosion control, stream corridor restoration, watershed management, forest and
                vegetation management, and wetland restoration and preservation.
               Emergency services. Emergency service actions protect people and property during and
                immediately after a disaster or hazard event. Services include warning systems, emergency
                response services, and critical facility protection efforts.
               Structural projects. Structural project actions involve the construction of structures to reduce
                the impact of a hazard. Such structures include dams, levees, floodwalls, seawalls, retaining
                walls, and safe rooms.
    5-8. The role of the installation emergency manager in mitigation activities is to participate in planning
    mitigation efforts under an integrated strategy through the IEMWG to ensure a cohesive and effective
    effort. Mitigation activities are executed by the applicable functional leads. Mitigation phase activities draw
    from a large number of resources established by federal and private sources. Many of these resources are
    available at the FEMA mitigation Web site at <http://www.fema.gov/government/mitigation.shtm> and at
    the FEMA Building Science Branch Web site at: <www.fema.gov/rebuild/buildingscience>.
    5-9. The installation coordinates pre- and postevent mitigation efforts with owners of specific
    technological hazards (dams; levees; airfields; rail transportation systems; mass transit systems; ferry
    systems; (petro) chemical facilities; related manufacturing, storage, or transportation systems) with the
    potential or historical impact to the installation. A best practice for this process is to coordinate these
    activities with the emergency managers of local civil jurisdictions.
    5-10. Table 5-2 outlines potential hazard mitigation controls and techniques that can be utilized.

      Best Practices Portfolio at <http: www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/bestpractices/index.shtm>, which is an
      online collection of case studies that depicts how organizations and communities have worked to reduce or
      prevent damage from disasters.

MITIGATION PLANNING
      5-12. According to FEMA, mitigation planning is the process used to identify risks and vulnerabilities
      associated with natural disasters. It is also used to develop long-term strategies for protecting people and
      property in future hazard events. The process results in a mitigation plan that offers a strategy for breaking
      the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repeated damage and presents a framework for developing


5-4                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                               26 April 2013
                                                                                                         Mitigate



    feasible and cost-effective mitigation projects. Cost-effective mitigation measures are the key to reducing
    disaster losses in the long term.
    5-13. Mitigation planning is considered by the IEMWG with the technical direction of the installation
    emergency manager and in coordination with appropriate functional area representatives (public works,
    AT, information technology). While the functional area representatives are wholly responsible for the
    planning and implementation of mitigation measures on the installation, the IEMWG mitigation plan
    captures the interim and long-term actions and goals of the installation to reduce the impact of hazards and
    threats that cannot be eliminated. A mitigation plan is a supporting plan to (or a plan element or component
    of) the IEM plan. The best practice is to identify a mitigation committee of select members of the IEMWG
    to create and maintain this plan.
    5-14. The installation mitigation plan is used to guide the combined mitigation efforts of relevant
    functional areas. It describes the physical, information technological, and nonmaterial mitigation strategies
    associated with hazards identified during the risk management process.
    5-15. A mitigation plan includes—
            A discussion of the planning process and partners involved.
            A discussion of the hazards and associated potential losses.
            Goals aimed at reducing or avoiding losses from identified hazards.
            Mitigation actions that help accomplish established goals.
            Strategies that detail how the mitigation actions will be implemented and administered.
            A description of how and when the plan will be updated.

LESSONS LEARNED
    5-16. Just as with the evaluation of training or an exercise, lessons learned from a real-world incident on an
    installation are documented and acted on to strengthen the IEM program and mitigate effects of future
    incidents. Immediately following an incident, installation staff who were active in the response and
    recovery efforts participate in a debriefing activity to capture best practices and lessons learned for
    inclusion in an AAR on the incident.
    5-17. The AAR includes recommendations for the remediation of current IEM practices to reflect lessons
    learned during the incident. AARs also include dissemination and notification of successes and shortfalls,
    installation-wide response checklists, deficiencies, deficiency correction plans, required training efforts,
    implementation dates, corrective actions, follow-up actions, and lessons learned. Higher headquarters
    establishes internal after-action reporting procedures to ensure that reporting objectives are met, problems
    are solved, and results are disseminated.
    5-18. As outlined in NIMS and HSEEP, lessons learned documented in the AAR are used to construct an
    IP and CAP, as described below. The IP and CAP are used (at a minimum) to restructure the IEM plan for
    better readiness and response.
    5-19. The IP converts lessons learned from the incident into concrete, measurable steps that result in
    improved EM capabilities. It specifically details the actions that will be taken to address each
    recommendation presented in the AAR, who or what agency will be responsible for taking the action, and
    the timeline for completion.
    5-20. The CAP tracks and assesses progress on enhancing preparedness and incorporating information into
    the emergency planning process. This process may identify needs for additional coordination, plans,
    procedures, organization, manning, training, equipment, and exercises. The CAP includes the incorporation
    of recommendations into updates to the risk management process and the annual revision of the IEM plan
    consistent with DODI 6055.17. The CAP is closed out when improvements have been implemented and
    validated through subsequent exercises and records are maintained on file as appropriate.
    5-21. Lessons learned are key outputs of the AAR and reflect best practices, consistent challenges and
    issues, and recommended solutions based on the evaluation of the incident. The Joint Lessons Learned
    Program is a knowledge-sharing process established to enhance joint capabilities through discovery,
    knowledge development, implementation, and the sharing of lessons from joint operations, training events,


26 April 2013                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              5-5

      exercises, and other activities. The Joint Lessons Learned Program applies to the full range of joint
      operations, including training, exercises, experiments, real-world events, and other activities involving

      5-22. Installations are also encouraged to engage with the federal Lessons Learned Information Sharing
      initiative and associated Web portal operated by DHS at <www.llis.gov>. The posting of lessons learned on
      the portal is permitted if approved by the installation commander after a legal review by the installation
      legal office.

SUMMARY
      5-23. Vulnerability reduction efforts are critical to implementing an effective mitigation strategy on an
      installation. The installation emergency manager, through the IEMWG, participates in the development of
      an installation mitigation strategy that is captured in the installation mitigation plan. This plan may support,
      or be a component of, the IEM plan. Throughout the EM cycle, installation emergency managers
      coordinate installation-wide mitigation efforts that are led by appropriate functional area representatives.
      Following an event or exercise, installation staff captures lessons learned during response and recovery
      phases and uses them to better inform their mitigation activities in the future. Lessons learned on an
      installation and from other collaborating partners are integral to enhancing an installation mitigation
      strategy.

                                               Appendix B
                                       Risk Management
        IEM planning is predicated on threat/hazard, vulnerability, and capability
        assessments. These assessments are used to evaluate the ability of an installation to
        respond to a threat or hazard, protect the population on the installation, and
        implement future strategies to mitigate risks.

PROCESS
    B-1. Risk management is a continuous process of reviewing critical infrastructure, assets, missions,
    hazards, threats, vulnerabilities, consequences, and existing response capabilities to determine what
    additional actions are needed to achieve or maintain a desired level of readiness and to protect the
    population on the installation. As shown in figure B-1, a full-scale risk assessment process is configured on
    the probability of a threat or hazard occurring; the vulnerability of an installation against that threat or
    hazard; the consequence or magnitude of negative effects of the threat or hazard; the relative value of
    critical infrastructure, assets, and missions; and the existing response capabilities for the mitigation of
    effects postevent.




                                    Figure B-1. Risk assessment process

    B-2. At a minimum, a risk assessment is dependent on a comprehensive, all-hazards process that
    includes—
            Hazard threat assessments.
            A VA.
            A capability assessment.
            A risk evaluation.




26 April 2013                     ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                          B-1
Appendix B



      B-3. A risk assessment may also include assessments of criticality, consequence, cost-benefit, and need.
      Risk factors from these assessments are combined in a risk evaluation that qualifies and/or quantifies risks
      and impacts future decisions for mitigation measures on an installation. When the resultant risk assessment
      is expressed in a manner that delineates which hazards and threats have more risk, it is called a relative risk
      assessment.
      B-4. These assessments incorporate information and recommendations from a variety of sources
      including, but not limited to, higher headquarters assessments, joint staff integrated VAs, CIP planning and
      assessments, COOP planning activities, and exercise deficiencies.
      B-5. As outlined in DODI 6055.17, the risk management process is performed and documented by the
      IEMWG under the authority of the installation commander and in coordination with functional areas such
      as AT, CBRN, and CIP. The completion of the risk management process occurs before the development of
      the initial IEM plan or IEM plan update and is an ongoing process. Effective risk management requires
      support from the IEMWG and, as appropriate, from state, local, and tribal governments; other military
      Services; or HN partners in the local community.
      B-6. The intent of the risk management process is not to fixate on a 100 percent solution or on the
      resolution of every variable to a defined quantity, but rather to provide a context in which to view relative
      risk across the entire enterprise in as much of an objective manner as possible, given the hazards. The risk
      management process provides a logical process to prioritize the development of specific capabilities and
      the application of limited financial and human resources to specific capabilities. Using the risk management
      process, the IEMWG can prioritize investments into those capabilities most applicable to local conditions
      and needs. The process identifies key preparedness, mitigation, and prevention opportunities, which reduce
      overall risk to the installation.
      B-7. Risk decisions are ultimately the responsibility of the installation commander and are made at the
      lowest possible level, except in extreme circumstances. Leaders and staffs manage risk. Staff members
      continuously look for hazards associated with their areas of expertise and then recommend controls to
      reduce risks. The role of the IEMWG in the installation risk management process is to identify controls,
      develop a process to implement them, recommend solutions to the installation commander, and implement
      the resulting decision.

CRITICALITY ASSESSMENTS
      B-8. Some Services use criticality (also referred to as critical asset or critical infrastructure) assessments
      as inputs to their risk evaluation as shown in figure B-1, page B-1. In most cases, these criticality
      assessments have already been developed by AT or CIP programs.
      B-9. The criticality assessment evaluates command missions and functions capabilities and determines
      mission impact or the consequence of the loss of assets that support command mission execution. Critical
      assets can be people, physical entities, systems, or information that provides a service or capability. The
      analysis examines those assets for which degradation or destruction impact the command ability to
      complete its assigned missions or functions.
      B-10. DODI 3020.45 describes the critical asset identification process (also see JP
      3-07.2). There are other assets that may not be critical to the execution of the mission or function that may
      be identified in this criticality process and included in the overall risk assessment process. These noncritical
      assets could include assets like high-population facilities, such as theaters, commissaries, and base
      exchanges.

HAZARD AND/OR THREAT ASSESSMENTS
      B-11. The development of an all-hazards threat assessment accomplishes two goals:
               The identification of a comprehensive list of threats and hazards.
               The likelihood or probability of occurrence of each threat or hazard. In the context of assessing
                risk, the higher the probability or likelihood of a threat or hazard occurring, the higher the risk of
                loss will be to the asset.




B-2                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                 26 April 2013
                                                                                              Risk Management



    B-12. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, IEM considers all hazards that may impact the installation. These
    hazards vary among installations. For example, hurricanes may be a significant natural hazard concern in
    the Southeast Region, but not in the Pacific Northwest. Tsunamis are of concern in the Pacific Northwest,
    but generally not in the Southeast. Toxic industrial materials are of concern at almost all installations.
    FEMA recommends including several other factors into the hazard assessment, including the time available
    until the onset of the hazard and the possibility of a single event to cascade and cause other failures. It is
    also beneficial for installation EM programs to coordinate threat and hazard assessments with state, local,
    and HN EM agencies.
    B-13. The federal government has a number of hazard-specific organizations that provide hazard
    information for specific geographic areas. Examples include—
             National Weather Service.
             National Hurricane Center.
             National Climatic Data Center.
             U.S. Geological Survey.
             National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
             U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
             U.S. Volcanic Observatories.
             National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.
             National Tsunami Hazards Reduction Program.
             Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program.
             Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program.
             FEMA Office for Domestic Preparedness.
             Environmental Protection Agency.
             Department of Transportation, National Response Center.
             National Interagency Fire Center.
    B-14. FEMA has a number of programs for consolidating and providing hazard information to state
    governments. In addition, each state and local jurisdiction applying for federal grant funding completes a
    thorough hazard assessment as part of the grant process. HN programs vary greatly, but most nations,
    provinces, and cities include a hazard assessment as part of their EM or civil defense programs. See DODI
    3020.52 for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE)-specific
    guidance.
    B-15. Terrorism and sabotage threats to strategic, operational, and mission-essential assets are also
    assessed. Installation commanders utilize existing threat assessment methods to gather and analyze the
    threats potentially impacting the installation on an ongoing basis and no less than annually. Threat
    information is integrated to meet the collective needs of EM, CBRNE preparedness, AT, CIP, and COOP
    planning. Installation commanders continuously ensure that forces are trained to maximize the use of threat
    assessments and intelligence derived from liaisons to civil and military LE and public safety agencies and
    departments and from EM, meteorological, environmental, public health, and medical syndromic
    surveillance processes and procedures.
    B-16. Each Service maintains its own terrorist threat analysis capability. Although DOD threat levels may
    only be set by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), special investigation offices and information fusion
    centers can provide valuable assessments to installation commands regarding terrorist threats for specific,
    localized areas. The following are primary sources of terrorism threat assessment data that contribute to
    indications and warnings for U.S. military forces:
              Marine Corps Forces Intelligence Department (G-2) or Information Fusion Center. The
               G-2 is the focal point for the intelligence support for FP-related intelligence, information, and
               counterintelligence (CI) issues for U.S. Marine Corps assets within their respective area of
               responsibility. The Information Fusion Center oversees the correlation of LE information in
               order to provide a domestic summary consistent with other DOD intelligence oversight
               directives.

                 Blue Line–a daily synopsis of global incidents of interest to Air Force personnel.
                DIA Joint Intelligence Task Force for Combating Terrorism (JITF-CT). Disseminates
                 intelligence on foreign terrorist threats, including the specific warning of threats against DOD
                 personnel, facilities, and other DOD material resources. Additionally, DIA produces a threat
                 assessment triennially, or if required, more frequently.
                Geographic combatant command area of responsibility. A specific supplement to the DIA–
                 produced global threats report.
                DHS Federal Bureau of Investigation intelligence and analysis reports. FBI field
                 intelligence groups are the hub of the FBI Intelligence Program. These reports contribute to local
                 and regional perspectives on threats and serve as the primary intelligence link between the FBI
                 and fusion centers.
                DHS intelligence reports. Includes DHS daily open-source infrastructure reports, digital library
                 critical releases, advisory system threat levels, daily infectious disease reports, daily drug
                 trafficking and smuggling reports, central digests, and daily cyber reports.

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS
      B-17. Vulnerability is a measure of the robustness of in-place installation and asset safeguards that are
      taken to prevent or mitigate a threat or hazard from impacting an installation. Vulnerabilities define the
      weaknesses or susceptibilities of an installation, system, asset, or application and identify its dependencies
      that could cause it to suffer a degradation or loss (incapacity to perform its designated function) as a result
      of having been subjected to a certain level of threat or hazard effects. The VA consists of the determination
      of the potential vulnerability of an installation or specific function to an identified hazard.
      B-18. Vulnerabilities to a critical asset can result from a wide variety of factors (design and construction
      flaws, environmental factors, proximity to other structures or systems, factors influencing accessibility,
      personal behaviors of people working in or around the critical assets, operational practices associated with
      the critical assets or the installation). Vulnerabilities of a critical asset can also be determined by
      vulnerabilities to other assets or areas that are not in close proximity to the critical asset. For instance,
      vulnerabilities in access or perimeter control of an installation may lead to an adversary gaining access to
      the installation and, ultimately, to the critical asset located somewhere inside the installation.
      B-19. Installation commanders conduct a local AT VA as outlined in DODD 2000.12 and DODI 2000.16
      for facilities, installations, and critical nodes within their areas of responsibility on an annual basis or, as
      required, more frequently. This VA addresses the broad range of threats to the installation and personnel.
      Existing AT VAs are used to establish the vulnerability of an installation or specific function to terrorist
      threats, but installation EM personnel still conduct a thorough VA for natural and manmade hazards not
      included within the AT scope.
      B-20. VAs of installations—
              Focus on the overarching EM and AT programs of the command.
              Determine asset-specific vulnerabilities applicable to particular threats and hazards.
              Assess the vulnerability scope of an asset, such as a single weakness or multiple weaknesses in
               the safeguard system.
              Assess the degree of difficulty in exploiting the vulnerability.
              Analyze installation structure and activities from the perspective of an adversary to obtain a
               basis for understanding real vulnerabilities. This may be accomplished through written
               questionnaires and surveys.

                                                                                                Risk Management



               Are classified according to appropriate security classification guides.
               Are disseminated for internal use at least annually.
    B-21. Process tools and resources for conducting VAs include—
             DOD O-2000.12-H, including checklists and aids.
             The Joint AT Program Manager’s Guide.
             Defense Threat Reduction Agency AT VA team guidelines.
             Preexisting higher headquarters assessments and Defense Threat Reduction Agency joint staff
              integrated vulnerability assessments, performed every 3 years for installations of greater than
              300 personnel.

CONSEQUENCE ASSESSMENTS
    B-22. Some Services also perform consequence assessments and use them as inputs to their risk evaluation
    as shown in figure B-1, page B-1. The consequence assessment determines the potential consequences that
    an identified hazard may have on an installation or on a specific function at the current level of EM
    capability of the installation. Consequence assessments include estimates for deaths, injuries, rebuilding
    infrastructure costs, and the magnitude of disruption in mission capabilities.

CAPABILITY ASSESSMENTS
    B-23. The capability assessment determines the current level of EM capability of the installation based on
    the integrated nonmaterial and material readiness of supporting functional areas. Capability assessments
    factor in the mitigating effects of existing emergency response manpower, procedures, training, equipment,
    and exercises to more accurately predict consequences. The capability assessment is especially important in
    the identification of capability gaps (needs) that are addressed to reduce the consequence of a specific
    hazard on an installation or on a specific function.
    B-24. The objectives of the capability assessment are to—
             Consider the range of identified and projected response capabilities necessary for responding to
              a hazard.
             List installation resources by type to provide an asset capability report.
             Review policy, guidance, and planning documents to identify the organization mission-essential
              tasks and functions assigned to the organization.
             List installation personnel with a mission-essential task responsibility as identified in DODI
              6055.17.
             Identify costs associated with assessment outcomes for future budget planning.

RISK EVALUATIONS
    B-25. Effective risk management requires that the assessment of each hazard be evaluated in terms of
    vulnerability, consequence, and the capability of the installation to manage the resulting emergency. All
    hazards are not equal in terms of probability or severity; therefore, risk evaluation can be used to establish
    relative risk in order for the installation commander to conduct risk management across the entire
    jurisdiction vice solely basing it on vulnerability or consequence of a specific hazard to a specific mission.
    B-26. Risk factors resulting from assessments for the various threats and hazards to each critical
    infrastructure asset mission are compared against each other to determine relative risks. This relative risk
    evaluation assists in future resource allocation, prioritization, and acquisition planning. Costs and benefits
    may need to be considered when deciding to acquire new resources.
    B-27. Service-specific examples of risk evaluation templates and matrices are provided in table B-1, page
    B-6; figure B-2, page B-7; figure B-3, page B-8; and table B-2, page B-9. The threats and hazards
    evaluated in each figure are notional and represent a small fraction of the total risks that an installation may
    need to evaluate. For details on using these tables and calculating risk, refer to Commander, Navy
    Installations Command (CNIC) Instruction 3440.17; FM 5-19; Marine Corps Order 3440.9; and the Air
    Force Hazard-Risk Assessment Tool.

NEEDS ASSESSMENT, COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS, AND
MITIGATION DECISIONS
    B-28. The risk assessment process seeks to evaluate and identify risks to the installation and its critical
    infrastructure assets missions based on the likelihood of threats and hazards occurring, the associated
    degrees of vulnerabilities, and the response capability. The risk mitigation process determines options and
    actions to reduce the risk of impact to the installation and its critical infrastructure assets missions. The
    options and actions include remediating risk, mitigating the effects of loss once the threat/hazard event
    occurs, reconstituting installation and asset capabilities after loss or disruption, acknowledging risk, and
    transferring the risk decision to a higher echelon of command.
    B-29. The needs assessment identifies additional risk mitigation strategies (procedures, training, activities,
    countermeasures, equipment) needed to reduce the probability and consequences of priority threats and
    hazards. Risk mitigation strategies that improve recovery are included in the analysis. Multiple layers of
    protection (defense in depth) against the most critical risks are considered.
    B-30. A key portion of the needs assessment analyzes and prioritizes the costs and benefits of risk
    mitigation strategies. Strategies involving equipment, facilities, or additional personnel are prioritized,
    tracked, and reported in time to support the budget process.

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS REVIEWS
    B-31. Risk management is a continual process that evolves as hazards are identified, mitigation actions are
    completed, prevention capabilities are developed and employed, and EM capabilities are developed to
    respond to, and recover from, identified hazards threats. The risk management process is executed as a
    cycle. Once the risk management is complete, it is essential that a thorough review of the overall process be
    conducted. This is typically done during the annual program review.
    B-32. Stakeholders in military and local civilian communities are involved in the review stage of the risk
    management process. This coordination or collaboration ensures that supporting plans align with the risk
    management process. Stakeholders from the local community can also identify strengths and weaknesses,
    focusing on collaboration between military and civilian agencies.

Appendix B



   B-33. The final stage in the risk management process review is to exercise the plan and make adjustments
   as needed. After the all-hazards risk management plan is implemented and set in motion, flaws may be
   identified that could not be comprehended during the planning process. If this occurs, pursue immediate
   modification.

                Installation Emergency Management Plan
        The IEM plan is an important document for the support of installation preparation,
        response, and recovery operations. IEM plans assign responsibilities to organizations
        and individuals within EM and across installation functional response communities,
        including assigned or attached personnel. IEM plans facilitate coordination with
        organizational plans in support areas such as LE, medical and public health,
        communications, logistics, physical security, training, intelligence support, AT,
        F&ES, EOD, and HAZMAT. At a minimum, IEM plans are reviewed annually and
        updated, as needed, to incorporate lessons learned and opportunities for improvement
        identified during real-life events, exercises, and risk management activities.

KEY ELEMENTS
    C-1. As outlined in DODI 6055.17, IEM plans are developed consistently with NRF and NIMS concepts
    and address, at a minimum, the following:
             Mission, goals, and objectives of the IEM program.
             Functional roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority for personnel, organizations, and
              agencies assigned to the EM response.
             Preparedness activities, including—
                   Risk management.
                   Prevention planning that establishes interim and long-term actions to reduce or eliminate
                    identified hazards and threats to the installation.
                   Mitigation planning that establishes interim and long-term actions to reduce the impact of
                    hazards and threats that cannot be eliminated.
                   Training.
                   Exercises.
                   Interagency coordination.
                   Equipment.
             Response planning that establishes response actions and assigns responsibilities for carrying out
              those actions. Specific response planning considerations include—
                   COOP planning that identifies mission-essential functions and personnel, procedures, and
                    resources, contact information of stakeholders to be notified; ERSs to be setup; and
                    functions to be maintained while the installation is recovering.
                   Evacuation management and mass care planning that address family assistance, SIP,
                    lockdown, local and remote safe havens, civilian shelters, personnel accountability, special-
                    needs management, animal needs management, behavioral health and religious support, and
                    family assistance centers.
                   Volunteer and donations management that establishes procedures for IEM plans for
                    organizing and coordinating the receipt of unsolicited services and goods in a manner that
                    comports with applicable law and policy and does not interfere with ongoing response and
                    recovery efforts.
                   Protocol to allow non-DOD first responders access to the installation during an emergency.
             Recovery planning that provides short- and long-term priorities for the restoration of functions,
              services, resources, facilities, and infrastructures.

                 (dispatch centers, enhanced 9-1-1 services, mobile command post and incident command
                 communication devices), EPI, and mass warning and reporting systems.

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
      C-2. The development of a comprehensive, integrated, and executable IEM plan is the responsibility of
      the installation commander. Command involvement is essential in the formation of a successful plan.
      C-3. The lead for IEM plan development and maintenance is the installation emergency manager. No
      single individual is tasked with the sole responsibility of developing an IEM plan. IEM plan development
      and documentation is a collective effort.
      C-4. The most effective method of developing and documenting an IEM plan is through the utilization of
      a cross-functional working group, such as the IEMWG. This working group includes the ESF managers (or
      office representatives) identified by the commander.
      C-5. Using the IEMWG enables the participation, input, and “buy-in” of necessary cross-functional
      subject matter experts. Everyone involved in IEM plan development and documentation should be
      thoroughly familiar with—
               Applicable IEM directives.
               Previous IEM plans and assessments.
               Data developed earlier in the overall IEM plan development process, including the results of
                threat, vulnerability, and capability assessments.
      C-6. The unpredictability of the IEM mission, with respect to the all-hazards scope of the plan, requires
      that the IEM plan provide SOPs and instructions to conduct and coordinate specific EM measures that may
      apply to all-hazards situations. Detailed “how to” instructions—
                Permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting plans.
                Focus on subordinate activities.
                Provide tasks, activities, constraints, and coordinating instructions.
                Do not inhibit initiative.
                Provide a clear, concise mission statement.
                Convey the intent of the commander.
                Include annexes and appendixes, if required, to expand the information not readily incorporated
                 in earlier text, particularly with respect to hazard-specific instructions that may apply in a given
                 scenario.
      C-7. The IEM plan format mirrors the FEMA CPG 101 emergency operations plan format, yet it is
      tailored to meet the unique requirements of comprehensive military IEM programs. The following are basic
      steps in developing an IEM plan:
                 Form a collaborative planning team.
                 Understand the situation, including conducting research and analyzing the information. Gather
                  and compile the information developed during earlier installation planning processes, including
                  results of threat, vulnerability, and capability assessments and community profiles.
                 Determine goals and objectives. IEM plan development and documentation requires a
                  comprehensive, integrated approach and a strong, clear vision of IEM program requirements.
                 Develop the plan. Produce a summary and basic plan. The plan summary provides the reader
                  with a concise synopsis of the scope and purpose of the plan. The basic plan provides the
                  groundwork for amplifying sections (annexes and appendixes), including SOPs and hazard-
                  specific appendixes (HSAs). Commander guidance is developed in conjunction with the basic
                  plan and is used to tailor the language of the plan to meet the mission and goals of the
                  commander.
                 Develop and analyze courses of action. Establish a plan of action and task suspense dates for the
                  completion of the plan and its annexes and appendixes. Identify resources. Determine and assign
                  responsibility for developing annexes and appendixes. Annexes provide the details not readily



C-2                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                26 April 2013
                                                                      Installation Emergency Management Plan



                incorporated into the basic plan, and they are written to increase the clarity and usefulness of the
                basic plan. These are only required if they are deemed necessary. Each annex relates to a specific
                aspect of the IEM operation. Appendixes further expand the annexes and contain a more detailed
                explanation of the concept IEM operations of the commander. Appendixes can be further
                subdivided into tabs and enclosures. The development and documentation of individual annexes
                and appendixes are tasked to IEMWG members with a related expertise or responsibility for the
                activity. For example, the public affairs representative supervises the development of the public
                affairs annex.
               Prepare, review, and gain approval of the plan.
                    Write the plan. Coordinate staff development and review of the plan. Each Service has
                     published guidance concerning deliberate planning, organization, and staff coordination
                     (FM 5-0, Navy Warfare Publication 5-01, Air Force Instruction [AFI] 10-2501, and Marine
                     Corps Warfighting Publication [MCWP] 5-1). The Navy has developed additional focused
                     disaster relief planning guidance within the following pair of Tactical Memorandums
                     (TACMEMOs): TACMEMO 3-07.6-06, and TACMEMO 3-07.7-06. Also plan, task, and
                     publish the development of supporting plans. Each subordinate and supporting commander
                     who is assigned a task in the IEM plan may prepare a supporting plan. Supporting plans are
                     consistent with supporting commander missions and responsibilities. Supporting plans are
                     submitted to the supported commander for review and approval.
                    Approve and disseminate the plan. Finalize the plan, and submit it through the staff and to
                     the commander for review and approval. The finalized plan is consistent with the
                     organization or installation mission and responsibilities; oriented on tactical perspective;
                     adequately detailed to provide specific actions to be taken; easily understood; and if
                     required executed quickly and decisively. After commander approval and upon execution,
                     the IEM plan becomes an operation order.
               Refine and execute the plan.
                    Exercise the plan, and evaluate its effectiveness. The IEM plan remains under constant
                     review to ensure that it is truly a “living document,” incorporating lessons learned and best
                     practices identified in training, exercises, real-life events, and changes in risk management
                     strategies.
                    Review, revise, and maintain the plan. When the IEM plan is published, the next planning
                     cycle begins. As preparation proceeds, assessments are continuously updated and may
                     require revisiting and revising the IEM plan. The IEM plan cannot remain static; rather, as
                     the situation changes, the plan also changes. The IEM plan is updated at least annually.
    C-8. As part of the development of the IEM plan, resources identified by the installation are allocated to
    prioritized requirements. The prioritization is made by the commander with input from the staff.

INSTALLATION EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN FORMAT
    C-9. The cover instruction constitutes the legal authority, mission assignments, relevant EM policy
    summary, and relevant role assignments and responsibilities associated with the IEM program as
    determined and signed by the installation commander. The target audience of the cover instruction is other
    commanders above, equal to, and subordinate to the approving commander.

          Note. According to FEMA and NIMS policy, there is no mandatory format for emergency
          operations plans. The following format provides a recommended structure based on the best
          practices among military and civilian EM planners. Unless otherwise directed by individual
          Services, installations are authorized to modify their plan formats to best suit the specific
          circumstances of the individual installation.

Appendix C



      C-10. The basic plan establishes the EM capabilities required to support the missions assigned by the cover
      instruction. The basic plan establishes the prevention, response, and recovery operational concepts; and
      determines and details the linkage between the IEM plan and supporting or supported plans and programs.
      The basic plan consists of at least the following sections:
                Authorities and references.
                Purpose, scope, applicability, and assumptions.
                Implementation process.
                Community profile (demographic, infrastructure, personnel categorization).
                Risk management results summary (list of community hazards, vulnerabilities).
                Preparedness strategy and requirements (community awareness activities, mass warning
                 notification systems and procedures, personnel accountability procedures).
                Response strategies and concepts (command and control of installation, IC [ICS/NIMS], SIP,
                 evacuation procedures).
                Recovery strategies and concepts (how will long- and short-term recovery be planned and
                 performed?).
                Mitigation strategies and activities (what mitigations are in place, and how will they be
                 activated?).
                Continuity strategies and continuity programs (COOP/continuity of business policies and
                 procedures).
                Plan management and maintenance efforts.
                Supporting plans and programs, including the installation AT plan, the installation F&ES plan,
                 MTF plans, and tenant command EAPs (what interdependencies exist, and how do these plans
                 support the overall EM program?).
      C-11. Functional area annexes and ESFs are developed for each assigned functional area with
      responsibilities in developing, fielding, employing, or sustaining EM capabilities. These annexes consist of
      detailed guidance for each assigned functional area related to the development and execution of target EM
      capabilities. The annexes assign responsibility to the organization and individuals for carrying out specific
      actions at projected times and places in an emergency. These actions are not specific to a particular hazard,
      but rather focus on core common components supported by the function itself. As discussed in DODI
      6055.17, Services may use the ESF-based organizational model or a functional area-based organizational
      model for IEM plans.
      C-12. ESFs are an operational level coordinating structure that federal agencies use to organize an
      interagency federal response to an event. ESFs are mechanisms for grouping functions most frequently
      used to provide federal support in the management of disasters and incidents. Specific functional personnel
      are assigned to lead or manage specific ESFs. These designated roles are referred to as ESF managers.
      C-13. While neither NIMS nor DOD mandates the use of an ESF structure when a nonfederal entity is
      coordinating an emergency under ICS, many state and local agencies use the ESF organization in their
      response effort. Therefore, ESF information is provided here for SA to facilitate the interface between
      installation and civilian response and recovery operations. An installation may choose to utilize an
      alternative functional area or equivalent organizational structure in their approach to readiness and
      response. Examples of responsibilities and manager roles for each ESF are shown in table C-1.
      C-14. If using the functional area structure, IEM plans include functional area annexes. These functional
      area annexes assign responsibility to the organization and individuals for carrying out specific actions at
      projected times and places in an emergency that exceeds the routine responsibility or capability of the
      functional area. These actions are not specific to a particular hazard, but rather focus on core common
      components supported by the functional area. Functional area annexes also identify unmet needs of each
      functional area that are necessary for the successful execution of assigned functions.

   C-15. HSAs are developed for each hazard identified in the risk management process. HSAs consist of
   detailed guidance specific to the prevention of, response to, and recovery from identified hazards. In
   planning for specific hazard operations, the installation can use the results of the vulnerability and risk
   assessment to determine and emphasize the most relevant hazards to that installation. HSAs direct the
   employment of core EM capabilities mandated in the basic plan in a specific sequence or manner to
   prevent, respond to, and recover from a specific hazard. Duties and responsibilities of assigned functional
   areas for the management of an emergency resulting from a specific hazard are summarized in each HSA.
   C-16. The following list of possible hazard categories is outlined in DODI 6055.17:
            Natural hazards (geological). Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, landslides, mudslides,
             subsidence, glaciers, icebergs.
            Natural hazards (meteorological). Floods, flash floods, seiche, tidal surges, droughts, fire
             (forest, range, urban, wild land, urban interface), snow, ice, hail, sleet, avalanches, windstorms,

                                                                    Installation Emergency Management Plan



               Human-caused events (intentional). Terrorism (CBRNE and cyber), sabotage, civil
                disturbance, public unrest, mass hysteria, riot, enemy attack, war, insurrection, strike or labor
                dispute, disinformation, criminal activity (vandalism, arson, theft, fraud, embezzlement, data
                theft), electromagnetic pulse, physical or information security breach, active shooter, product
                defect or contamination.
               Technologically caused events. Central computer, mainframe, software, or application (internal
                and external); ancillary support equipment; telecommunications; energy (power or utility).
    C-17. The decision to develop an HSA for an IEM plan is based on special planning requirements not
    common to other hazards addressed within the plan and on regulatory considerations that may require
    extensive, detailed planning. The content of an HSA focuses on the special planning needs generated by the
    hazard and does not duplicate the information in the larger plan.
    C-18. The HSA contains unique and regulatory response planning details that apply to a single hazard. It
    addresses the essential operational actions that must be accomplished to facilitate the successful completion
    of a particular response function. As appropriate, the HSA quantifies the risk area, geography, and
    demography considerations that apply to the hazard.
    C-19. While the nature of each HSA will be highly dependent on elements unique to each installation,
    some operational commonalities exist for each individual hazard. Excellent guidance on response
    operations for specific hazards is located in the incident annexes of the NRF (<see
    http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nrf/incidentannexes.htm>). Although these incident annexes were written
    for a civilian government response effort, much of the content of these incident annexes can be used to
    frame the development of HSAs for inclusion into a DOD installation EM plan. The following incident
    annexes are currently available from the various Web sites listed below:
               Biological incidents:
                <http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf_BiologicalIncidentAnnex.pdf>.
               Catastrophic incidents:
                <http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf_CatastrophicIncidentAnnex.pdf>.
               Food and agriculture incidents:
                <http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf_FoodAgricultureIncidentAnnex.pdf>.
               Mass evacuations:
                <http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf_massevacuationincidentannex.pdf>.
               Nuclear/radiological incidents:
                <http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf_nuclearradiologicalincidentannex.pdf>.
               Cyberspace incidents:
                <http://www.learningservices.us/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrp_cyberincidentannex.pdf>.
    C-20. Further detail on the development of HSAs can be found in chapter 6 of FEMA CPG 1-01, which is a
    guide to assist state and local governments in all-hazards emergency operations planning. Elements of this
    guidance have to be reconstructed to apply to the installation instead of to a civilian government structure;
    however, the basic principles of hazard-specific planning still apply at the installation level.
    C-21. Each Service EM program has excellent templates and checklists for hazard-specific events that
    pertain for each Service installation. See CNIC INST 3440.17 for response action guides pertaining to
    CBRNE events, hurricanes, earthquakes, and fire response operations. See Air Force Installation
    Emergency Management Program 10-2501 template for checklists pertaining to major accidents, natural
    disasters, attack actions, and terrorist use of CBRNE. Department of the Army Pamphlet 525-27 contains
    guidance for Army installations.
    C-22. Support annexes add specific information and direction to the emergency operations plan. Support
    annexes focus on critical operational functions and who is responsible for carrying them out. These annexes
    clearly describe the policies, processes, roles, and responsibilities that agencies and departments carry out
    before, during, and after an emergency. While the basic plan provides broad, overarching information,
    these annexes focus on specific responsibilities, tasks, and operational actions that pertain to the
    performance of a particular emergency operations function.

   C-23. These annexes also establish targets for preparedness (training, exercises, equipment checks,
   maintenance) that facilitate achieving function-related goals and objectives during emergencies and
   disasters. This list of emergency response functions is not exhaustive or comprehensive. Each jurisdiction
   assesses its own needs, and additional or different annexes are prepared at the discretion of the planning
   team.

                                                Appendix D
Response Operations and Emergency Operations Centers
        The response phase of an incident is usually the most energy-intensive of all phases;
        manpower, infrastructure, and resources are sustained on a 24-hour cycle from the
        moment an incident is triggered until the incident is brought under control and
        recovery begins. Response activities are managed by the IC on-scene, while support
        to the response is managed and coordinated by the EOC for the duration of the
        response. These activities are governed by the ICS process and principles.

INCIDENT TRIGGERS
    D-1. An initial incident or series of incidents results in a trigger that sets a series of response actions in
    motion. The type of trigger will depend on whether it is associated with a warning or no-warning incident,
    sometimes referred to as notice or no-notice incidents. Examples of warning incidents include, but are not
    limited to, hurricanes and other predictable natural hazards or pandemic disease. Examples of no-warning
    incidents include, but are not limited to, earthquakes, flash floods, HAZMAT spills or releases, and terrorist
    attacks. Triggers also depend on the speed of event onset, with incidents such as chemical spills considered
    immediate onset and incidents such as disease outbreaks considered slow onset.
    D-2. Triggers may be the result of a natural hazard or a signal received from deployed detection
    equipment, medical surveillance information, visual observance, and/or intelligence analysis. The types of
    detection technologies deployed at installations may vary; however, installations have access to—
              Intelligence sharing and dissemination. Installations identify multiple intelligence sources
               within and outside the DOD (including those that can be obtained through an open source) and
               establish the degree to which information sharing is allowable with EM organizations outside the
               DOD. These sources may include natural hazards warning systems available within the
               community or information gathered with specialized CBRN and explosive detector/surveillance
               technology, as available on the installation.
              Health threat surveillance and detection. The medical official or designee identifies medical
               and public health information needed, ensures medical laboratory support to confirm and
               identify hazardous substances in the affected environment, integrates and monitors medical
               surveillance systems operations, and monitors the health status of essential personnel and the
               general population.
              Medical intelligence. The public health or medical functional area designee collects information
               from available medical sources, provides medical information to local organizations and private-
               sector partners, and works to sustain information and/or intelligence-gathering activities
               necessary for assessing emerging health threat information during an incident.

COMMAND AND CONTROL
    D-3. During an event, command and control is implemented through the ICS, at times using an EOC or a
    mobile command center as a central command location.

INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM
    D-4. The ICS provides its users with an integrated organizational structure to match the complexities and
    demands of single or multiple incidents without being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries. The resulting
    UC not only coordinates the efforts of many jurisdictions, but also provides for and assures joint decisions
    on objectives, strategies, plans, priorities, and public communications.




26 April 2013                     ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                           D-1
Appendix D



      D-5. The NIMS requires ICS use for responses and specifies that all levels of government must adopt the
      ICS. It is used across the range of incidents, from small to complex and from natural to manmade,
      including acts of catastrophic terrorism. The ICS may be expanded to include a UC for complex responses
      that require multiagency and/or multijurisdictional resources.
      D-6. The ICS is based on proven management principles, which contribute to the strength and efficiency
      of the overall system used to implement a response action according to the execution tasks outlined in the
      IEM plan. The ICS principles are implemented through a wide range of management features, including the
      use of common terminology, clear text, and a modular organizational structure. The ICS emphasizes
      effective planning, including management by objectives and reliance on an incident action plan (IAP).
      D-7. The principal ICS management functions include—
              Command. The IC is responsible for incident or event activity. Although other functions may
               be left unfilled, there will always be an IC.
              Operations. The operations section is responsible for directing the tactical actions to meet
               incident objectives.
              Planning. The planning section is responsible for collecting, evaluating, and displaying incident
               information; maintaining the status of resources; and preparing the IAP and incident-related
               documentation.
              Logistics. The logistics section is responsible for providing adequate services and support to
               meet incident or event needs.
              Finance/administration. The finance/administration section is responsible for keeping track of
               incident-related costs and personnel and equipment records and for administering procurement
               contracts associated with the incident or event.

            Note. Each functional area can be expanded as needed into additional organizational units with
            further delegation of authority.

      D-8. Because the ICS allows for organizational flexibility, an intelligence/investigation function can be
      embedded in several different places within the organizational structure:
              Within the planning section. This is the traditional placement for the intelligence/investigation
               function and is appropriate for incidents with little or no investigative information requirements
               or a significant amount of specialized information.
              As a separate general staff section. This may be appropriate when there is an
               intelligence/investigative component to the incident or when multiple investigative agencies are
               part of the investigative process and/or there is a need for classified intelligence.
              Within the operations section. This may be appropriate for incidents that require a high degree
               of linkage and coordination between the investigative information and the operational tactics that
               are being employed.
              Within the command staff. This may be appropriate for incidents with little need for tactical
               information or classified intelligence and where supporting agency representatives provide real-
               time information to the command element.
      D-9. The modular organization of the ICS allows responders to scale their efforts and apply the parts of
      the ICS structure that best meet the demands of the incident. There are no hard-and-fast rules for when or
      how to expand the ICS organization.
      D-10. Many incidents never require the activation of planning, logistics, or finance/administration sections,
      while others require some or all of them to be established. A major advantage of the ICS organization is the
      ability to fill only those parts of the organization that are required. However, if there is a need to expand the
      organization, additional positions exist within the ICS framework to meet virtually any need. For example,
      in operations involving responders from a single jurisdiction, the ICS establishes an organization for
      comprehensive response management. However, when an incident involves more than one agency or
      jurisdiction, responders can expand the ICS framework to address a multijurisdictional incident.

    D-11. An IAP is an oral or written plan communicating the overall incident objectives in the context of
    operational and support activities for managing an incident. The creation of an IAP is critical to identifying
    operational resources and assignments and allows for management by objectives established in the IAP
    process. Every incident has a verbal or written IAP; however, written IAPs are highly recommended. At the
    simplest level, IAPs have four elements:
              What do we want to do?
              Who is responsible for doing it?
              How do we communicate with each other?
              What is the procedure if someone is injured?
    D-12. The IAP process allows for functional organization and management by objectives in the response
    effort. The process consists of the following steps:
              Step 1. Understand installation, component, and Service policy and direction.
              Step 2. Assess the incident, and maintain SA.
              Step 3. Establish incident objectives (see the IAP).
              Step 4. Select appropriate strategies to achieve objectives.
              Step 5. Perform tactical direction, and assign and monitor resources.
              Step 6. Provide a follow-up and iterative reevaluation of the process.
    D-13. The operational period defines the complete planning cycle. A planning cycle is typically established
    by the IC and planning section chief, and an IAP is then developed by the planning section for the next
    operational period (usually 12 or 24 hours in length) and submitted to the IC for approval. The creation of a
    planning cycle and the development of an IAP for a particular operational period helps to focus the
    available resources on the highest priorities/incident objectives. The planning cycle, if properly practiced,
    brings together input and identifies critical shortfalls that need to be addressed to carry out IC objectives for
    that period.
    D-14. The UC is an ICS management process which allows all agencies who have jurisdictional or
    functional responsibility for the incident to jointly develop a common set of incident objectives and
    strategies. This is accomplished without losing or giving up agency authority, responsibility, or
    accountability. The UC is an important feature of ICS. It allows agencies having a legitimate responsibility
    at an incident to be a part of the incident command function.
    D-15. During the emergency response effort, the transfer of command and/or responsibility may occur
    several times as the scope of the emergency shifts or as an operational period begins or ends. During such
    transfers, all replacements are briefed on actions taken, actions needed, and the general status of the
    operation. Civilian officials are kept in the loop through introductions to new incoming members of the key
    workforce.

EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER
    D-16. An EOC is the focal point of operations for the support of the IC and those responders at the incident
    site. The EOC is the location where the coordination of information and resources in support of the incident
    take place. The EOC is normally located in a permanent facility within the installation; however, an
    alternate or temporary location may be utilized when the primary location is unusable.
    D-17. The installation commander, or his designee, activates the EOC to manage incident response
    resources. The installation commander provides guidance to the EOC on mission priorities. The installation
    commander approves, directs, or ensures IC or EOC RFAs from external specialized teams are forwarded
    through the higher headquarters component or DOD component commanders. During an incident, the EOC
    considers the following initial response actions:
              EOC assembly. Based on the magnitude of the incident, the EOC is recalled as the full EOC or
               tailored to include only those staff members and ESFs required to handle the incident. When
               there is doubt, it is easier to recall the full EOC staff and subsequently dismiss those members
               not required.

Appendix D



               EOC activation. The EOC is activated by the installation commander. The EOC updates the
                CAT with incident status reports. The EOC is comprised of ESFs (or designated functional area
                equivalents) and other functional agency representation as needed. Depending on the complexity
                and size of an event, the EOC may be activated to manage the operations needed to support
                contingencies. The EOC coordinates with the IC, civilian EOCs, EOD, F&ES, communications
                centers, and medical services.
               Initial activation. It is not always necessary to activate the full and complete EOC. During
                event planning or predesignated threat warning (such as increased FP conditions or hurricane
                conditions), the EOC may be placed in a “warm” status. During small incidents, a few ESFs may
                be needed, thus requiring only a partial activation. During large or major incidents and
                subsequent recovery, a full activation may be necessary.
               Warm status activation. Simply stated, warm status of the EOC means that the lights,
                computers, communication, and other key components are turned on in preparation for a higher
                level of activity. During warm status, the EOC will run any preactivation or startup checklists.
               Partial activation. Partial activation requires that only certain ESFs or functional areas are
                recalled to support responders at an incident. There are two ways to conduct a partial activation:
                recall and brief the entire EOC and all functional areas, and then release ESFs that are not
                needed. Notify only the necessary functional areas.
               Full activation. Full activation is recalling all the members of the EOC, all ESF/functional area
                offices of primary responsibility, and supporting participants. A major incident and its
                subsequent recovery require the full EOC. Alternatively, full activation may be followed by a
                situation briefing and a shift to partial activation.
      D-18. The EOC provides oversight for the installation commander to support and control emergency or
      contingency incidents. The EOC can support multiple ICs simultaneously, while providing strategic senior
      officer level command and control for sustained response and recovery operations. The EOC is responsible
      for directing the ESFs or functional areas. Once the EOC staff is operating, they coordinate responsive
      information and resources that the IC needs to respond to the incident. In addition, the EOC provides the
      IC, through the ESFs/functional areas, the support required to control the incident, restore mission
      capabilities, and sustain response and recovery activities. The EOC keeps the installation commander fully
      informed on the incident response efforts throughout the operation. The EOC establishes and maintains an
      accurate and timely SA. It is the responsibility of the EOC to ensure that the entire staff is populating
      current incident information through the installation COP.

MOBILE COMMAND CENTER
      D-19. Mobile command centers provide for continuous command and control capability during periods
      when the primary or alternate EOC will not be in operation, such as when emergency teams are transferring
      between a primary and alternate EOC. The mobile command center also provides the capability to provide
      command and control for localized field operations.
      D-20. IEM programs may consider incorporating a mobile command center into their response capabilities.
      The mobile command center provides both operations and communications capability, which may be
      divided into separate vehicles that travel together.
      D-21. The mobile command center is equipped with basic communications equipment, computers, and
      video display systems to provide similar support as the primary EOC. It is of sufficient size to
      accommodate the equipment and the primary team members and commanders. The equipment on the
      mobile command center is interoperable with EOC systems.
      D-22. The mobile command center is maintained in a complete state of readiness. It is self-propelled or
      transportable without special equipment and capable of traveling over public roadways, including
      unimproved roadway surfaces.

                                        Communications
        The topic of communications can mean many different things with respect to EM.
        Communications may include information management in the formation and
        maintenance of a COP, interoperable communication standards and equipment, mass
        warning and notification systems, or EPI. But one thing is certain—well-planned,
        fully coordinated, interoperable, timely and accurate communication that takes place
        consistently throughout the EM process can help to ensure effective planning,
        response, recovery, and mitigation.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
    E-1. Information management is an important element in supporting a COP. Effective EM and incident
    response activities rely on flexible communications and information systems that provide a COP to
    EM/response personnel and their affiliated organizations. Establishing and maintaining a COP and ensuring
    accessibility and interoperability are the principal goals of the communications and information
    management component of NIMS. Properly planned, established, and applied communications enable the
    dissemination of information among command and support elements and, as appropriate, cooperating
    agencies and organizations.
    E-2. The IEM program ensures that information technology requirements are addressed for all appropriate
    entities, including mass warning and notification systems, continuity plans, installation dispatch center,
    installation EOC, predesignated mass care locations, and other preidentified locations applicable to the
    execution of the IEM plan.
    E-3. All entities involved in managing an incident use common terminology for communications as
    outlined in NIMS. This allows diverse operational, management, and support entities to work together
    across a wide variety of incident management functions. Standard common terminology is a key principle
    of NIMS; therefore, it is important to limit the unnecessary creation of terminology.
    E-4. The IEM programs strive for interoperability with local civil jurisdictions and other military Services
    in the vicinity of the installation. Interoperability includes the technical exchange of information and the
    end-to-end operational effectiveness of that exchange of information as required for mission
    accomplishment. The EM interoperability is more than just information exchange, as it includes systems,
    processes, procedures, organizations, and missions over the life cycle and is balanced with information
    assurance.

MASS WARNING NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS
    E-5. Executive Order 13407 requires the United States to have an effective, reliable, integrated, flexible,
    and comprehensive system to alert and warn the American people in times of emergency. Various federal
    entities, ranging from FEMA to the National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC), have established programs, standards, and funding mechanisms to ensure that alert and
    warning systems are sustained and interoperable at the federal, state, and local levels. The goal of a national
    mass notification effort is for citizens to receive rapid, secure, and trustworthy messages in times of
    emergency.
    E-6. Military installations are also required to provide mass warning notification to their protected
    population. DODI 6055.17, the Report of the DOD Independent Review (Protecting the Force: Lessons
    from Fort Hood), and the resulting Secretary of Defense memo (Final Recommendations of the Fort Hood
    Follow-on Review) require installations to field a mass warning notification system capability in order to
    achieve full operational capability.


26 April 2013                     ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                            E-1
Appendix E



      E-7. Mass warning notification systems serve a variety of functions on and off an installation:
             FP and other population protection—mass dissemination of alerts to accelerate community
              action and response.
             Personnel recall—rapid activation of off-base personnel to report for duty.
             Personnel accountability—proactive assessment of force status and its ability to perform duties.
      E-8. Installations are likely to have multiple redundant systems to maximize the potential for reaching all
      personnel:
                Networked computers—delivery of audiovisual notifications to personal computers connected to
                 the Internet protocol network.
                Telephone—delivery of alerts as audio messages to any phone, sometimes called “Reverse
                 9-1-1”.
                Text messaging—delivery of text messages and/or e-mail to mobile phones, pagers,
                 smartphones, or fax machines.
                Indoor and outdoor speakers—audio notifications via sirens and the activation of indoor and
                 outdoor emergency warning and mass notification systems.
                Cable television and display boards—text alerts to digital displays.
                Radio broadcasts—audio broadcasts to local radio stations.
                National Emergency Alert System—delivery of text-based alerts via common alerting protocol
                 to the National Public Alert System.
                Residential route alerting—messages announced to neighborhoods from vehicles equipped with
                 public address systems.
      E-9. Installations with significant on-base or nearby off-base family housing cooperate with local
      authorities for access to radio and television emergency communication systems. Overseas, a mass warning
      notification system includes warning sponsored family members living off base, ideally by the integration
      with local or HN systems.
      E-10. Mass warning notification systems are most effective when notices and messages can be developed
      in advance of an incident, vetted through the appropriate channels, and placed on standby until needed. In
      this way, the installation can identify diverse populations and their communications needs and tailor
      messages to fit them under a variety of circumstances. This preevent message development significantly
      shortens the lag time between an event and the notification of the population.

INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS
      E-11. The NRF describes how communities, tribes, states, the federal government, and private sector and
      nongovernmental partners work together to coordinate national response. An integral part of this
      multisector coordination is interoperable communications.
      E-12. The land mobile radio system is a nontactical radio frequency system that supports installation FP,
      public safety, and EM entities. Land mobile radio systems have the capability to interconnect with state and
      local counterpart mobile radio networks to foster interdependencies and interoperability with civilian
      jurisdictions during incident response. The Association of Public Safety Communication Officials Project
      25 (APCO-25), also known as Project 25 or P25, is a two-way, digital land mobile radio system technology
      suite of standards for use by federal, state/province, and local public safety agencies in North America to
      enable them to communicate with other agencies and mutual aid response teams in emergencies. This
      standard has not yet been implemented in all localities; however, installations ensure that newly purchased
      communications assets are compliant for future capability. The National Emergency Communications Plan
      and the Federal Communications Commission have identified interoperable frequencies for public safety
      radio bands, and these are programmed within LMRS units whenever possible.
      E-13. Long-term evolution (LTE) is the preferred broadband technology platform for a common air
      interface established by the Federal Communications Commission for 700 Megahertz public safety
      broadband networks to create a foundation for wireless interoperability and provide a clear path for the
      deployment and evolution of a nationwide interoperable public safety broadband network. LTE has the

                                                                                              Communications



    potential to handle voice and data communications. Public safety broadband network providers are required
    to submit certification that their networks support required LTE interfaces.
    E-14. Some communications technologies offer the ability to fully integrate LTE and APCO-25 standards
    within one system. Additional telecommunications considerations for interoperability may include base
    telephone infrastructure, multiplexers, switches, routers, optical fiber, and personal computers with
    standard software configured for local area networks and wide area networks, and installation incident
    command vehicles.

EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION
    E-15. The EPI is based on the integration of complementary crisis communication and risk communication
    theories and techniques. In this context, crisis communication is the ability to communicate effectively with
    other government agencies, the media, and the general public by delivering accurate and timely information
    that is designed to inform, educate, and guide the public in any necessary response actions they need to take
    to protect themselves, their families, and their communities. A recommendation to shelter in place is an
    example of crisis communication.
    E-16. In concert with crisis communication, risk communication is an interactive process, not an event. The
    risk communication process facilitates the exchange of information and opinion (real or perceived) among
    individuals, groups, or institutions. Risk communication is proactive and engages with stakeholders about
    their issues and concerns in order to communicate the complexities and uncertainties of risk. Risk
    communication efforts are the foundation of an effective EPI program during all phases of EM. Many
    federal agencies are currently teaching, training, and implementing EPI practices based on this combination
    of crisis and risk communication principles.
    E-17. In some cases, the foundational EPI principles listed below may run counter to many instinctive
    practices. It is human nature to wait until we know everything we can before releasing information in an
    attempt to allay fear and reduce the potential for panic. The principles provided below balance these
    instincts with behavioral principles that govern how people receive and process information. For example,
    we know that panic is actually more likely to occur in the absence of information. We also know that, in
    general, people perform at their best under crisis conditions and that the public must have trust and
    confidence in the response. We also know that the media is a primary means for communicating with the
    public. Given that background, the eight basic EPI principles are described below:
               Be proactive; communicate before, during, and after an emergency. The best time to plan
                for EPI and build working relationships with other government agencies, the media, and citizens,
                is before the stress and strain of a response. Plan to communicate with the potentially affected
                public by engaging them in determining—
                    What information will be needed before, during, and after an emergency?
                    Who will need to be informed and how?
                    What are the opportunities for effective information exchange, and how can they be
                     maximized?
                    What are the obstacles for effective information exchange, and how can they be overcome?
                    What questions can be anticipated?
                    How can the needs of the news media be met?
                    What message does higher headquarters want to convey?
               Take the high ground in an emergency. The first messages are the most important. Get
                accurate messages out quickly. Keep it simple. Be consistent. Build trust and confidence by
                expressing empathy and caring, competence and expertise, honesty and openness, and
                commitment and dedication.
               Craft messages carefully. Follow your public information protocols to verify and approve
                messages, and then promptly release messages to the public. Stay on message. Avoid jargon. Be
                careful with risk comparisons. Recognize the information needs of your different audiences.
               Trust people to do the right thing. People often perform best under the most trying
                circumstances. Do not focus on alleviating panic. Acknowledge uncertainty. Do not over-
                reassure. Tell the truth. Deal with rumors.

Appendix E



            Give the public things to do. Give people guidance on how they need to respond.
            Select the right spokespersons. Effective spokespersons are trained, comfortable with their
             role, familiar, and credible.
            Form positive relationships with the media. Recognize the media as a primary source of
             public information. Understand and meet their needs for information.
            Be prepared to answer questions. Anticipate questions and prepare. Stay on message. Be
             honest and accurate. Provide accurate follow-up information promptly. Do not improvise,
             speculate, or say “no comment.”

                                              Appendix F
                                 Resource Management
        Resource management involves coordinating and overseeing the application of tools,
        processes, and systems that provide incident management personnel with timely and
        appropriate resources during an incident. Resources may include personnel, teams,
        information, expert knowledge, facilities, technology, equipment, supplies,
        specialized training, and funding (financial resources). Resource management takes
        place at all levels in support of the incident management activities at the installation
        EOC, dispatch center, ICP, and related incident management nodes. To implement
        these concepts and principles in performing the primary tasks of resource
        management, the IEM program includes standardized procedures, methodologies,
        and functions in its resource management processes. These processes reflect
        functional considerations, geographic factors, and validated practices within and
        across disciplines and are continually adjusted as new lessons are learned.

PRINCIPLES
    F-1. Consistent with NIMS, DODI 6055.17, and NFPA 1600, each IEM program employs NIMS-based
    resource management procedures to prioritize resource allocation at the installation level. NIMS resource
    management consists of four primary tasks, which include—
             Establishing systems for describing, inventorying, requesting, and tracking resources.
             Activating these systems prior to and during an incident.
             Dispatching resources prior to and during an incident.
             Deactivating, recalling, or demobilizing resources during or after an incident.
    F-2. The NIMS principles of resource management are—
            Advance planning. Preparedness organizations work together in advance of an incident to
             develop plans for managing and employing resources in a variety of possible emergency
             circumstances.
            Resource identification and ordering. Resource managers use standardized processes and
             methodologies to order, identify, mobilize, dispatch, and track the resources required to support
             incident management activities. Resource managers perform these tasks either at an IC’s request
             or according to planning requirements.
            Resources organization. Resources are categorized by size, capacity, capability, skill, and other
             characteristics. This makes the resource ordering and dispatch process within jurisdictions,
             across jurisdictions, and between governmental and nongovernmental entities more efficient and
             ensures that ICs receive resources appropriate to their needs.
            Support agreements. Preincident support agreements among all parties providing or requesting
             resources are necessary to enable effective and efficient resource management during incident
             operations. Formal preincident agreements between parties, governmental and nongovernmental,
             that might provide or request resources are established to ensure the employment of
             standardized, interoperable equipment and other incident resources during incident operations.
            Personnel certification and credentialing. Personnel certification entails authoritatively
             attesting that individuals meet professional standards for the training, experience, and
             performance required for key incident management functions. Credentialing involves providing
             documentation that can authenticate and validate the certification and identity of designated
             incident managers and emergency responders. This system helps ensure that personnel
             representing various jurisdictional levels and functional disciplines possess a minimum common



26 April 2013                    ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                        F-1
Appendix F



                level of training, currency, experience, physical and medical fitness, and capability for the
                incident management or emergency responder position that they are tasked to fill.
               Equipment interoperability. Ensure, when possible, that installation emergency response
                equipment is interoperable with equipment used by mutual aid partners in local communities.
      F-3. Resource management includes identifying the quantity, quality, capabilities, limitations, cost, and
      liability connected with each resource and the timeframe within which each resource is required. This
      concept of resource management provides a uniform method of identifying, acquiring, allocating, and
      tracking resources and increases the effective use of support agreements, mutual aid, volunteer assistance,
      and donations through the standard classification and sharing of kinds and types of resources required for
      incident management.
      F-4. The resource management process can be separated into two parts—resource management as an
      element of preparedness and resource management during an incident. The preparedness activities
      (resource typing, credentialing, and inventorying) are conducted on a continual basis to help ensure that
      resources are ready to be mobilized when called to an incident. Resource management during an incident is
      a finite process, specific to the needs of the particular incident, that includes identifying requirements,
      ordering and acquiring, mobilizing, tracking and reporting, recovering and demobilizing, and reimbursing.

RESOURCE TYPING
      F-5. As outlined in NIMS, resource typing entails categorizing (by capability) the resources that incident
      managers commonly request, deploy, and employ. Measurable standards identifying the capabilities and
      performance levels of resources serve as the basis for categories. Resource users at all levels identify these
      standards and then type resources on a consensus basis, with a national level entity taking the coordinating
      lead. Resource kinds may be divided into subcategories (types) to more precisely define more precisely the
      resource capabilities needed to meet specific requirements. Resource typing is a continuous process
      designed to be as simple as possible to facilitate frequent use and accuracy in obtaining needed resources
      (see NIMS for additional details). To allow resources to be deployed and used on a national basis, the
      National Integration Center is responsible for defining national resource typing standards.

            Note. The Tier One and Tier Two assets discussed below are terms established by DHS and
            FEMA for resource typing. There is no correlation or linkage between these asset/resource
            descriptions and the installation Tier Designations 2, 1, and 0 established by the Joint Program
            Manager Installation Protection Program for the purposes of equipment fielding. NIMS
            resources will be listed throughout this publication with designation of Tier One and Tier Two
            for delineation.

               National NIMS Tier One Assets. To allow resources to be deployed and used on a national
                basis, the National Integration Center is responsible for defining national resource typing
                standards for NIMS Tier One assets (national level resources). NIMS Tier One assets have strict
                requirements regarding organization, manning, training, certification, credentialing, equipment,
                and past experience with federal and/or state disaster declarations. Past DSCA operations do not
                count for previous experience. All installation capabilities are retained under DOD control and
                are not nationally deployed by FEMA independent of DSCA mission assignments. Therefore,
                under ordinary circumstances it is likely that none of the available NIMS Tier One resource
                definitions are applicable to installations.
               State and Local NIMS Tier Two Assets. NIMS Tier Two assets are those resources defined
                and inventoried by local jurisdictions, including IEM programs, that are not Tier One resources
                and are not assigned to interstate mutual aid deployment under EM assistance compacts. This
                definition includes all identified IEM program resources. IEM programs comply with NIMS
                requirements by developing standardized resource typing definitions for local IEM programs to
                the extent possible. Installations type all resources identified within their jurisdiction or with
                which they have an approved support agreement or contract. Installations may develop local
                typing criteria for additional NIMS Tier Two assets identified in the planning process.

    F-6. If a requester is unable to describe an item by resource type or classification system, those with
    resource management responsibilities provide technical advice to enable the requirements to be defined and
    translated into a specification. Specific resources for CIKR may need to be identified and coordinated
    through MAAs and/or assistance agreements unique to those sectors.
    F-7. FEMA has established 120 resource typing definitions, and they are available at
    <http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nims/ResourceMngmnt.shtm>. Further National Integration Center
    guidance on NIMS resource typing methodologies can be found at <http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency

                Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, and Lockdown
        Under certain conditions, it may become necessary to protect the population from
        imminent hazards during an incident. The installation commander decides the best
        method for this measure based on the conditions of the incident; for example, the
        nature of the hazard, the environmental conditions, or the amount of time before an
        incident will occur (in the case of notice events). The three options available to the
        installation commander for geographically protecting the installation populous are
        evacuation, shelter in place, and lockdown. Once an installation commander institutes
        an order for evacuation, shelter in place, or lockdown, a personnel accountability
        program is executed to keep track of all personnel through the duration of the event.

EVACUATION
    H-1. Evacuation removes a population at risk from the hazard(s) at hand and, therefore, significantly
    decreases the scope, scale, and impact of any emergency. During an evacuation, an endangered population
    is directed to use specified evacuation routes and transportation methods to depart a threatened
    area/location. The safe evacuation of threatened populations when endangered by a catastrophic event is
    one of the principal reasons for developing an IEM plan.

EVACUATION MANAGEMENT
    H-2. Evacuation management is the capability to direct and manage the evacuation of personnel and/or
    community members and pets to a local safe haven on the installation, a civilian shelter provided by one or
    more civil jurisdictions, or a predesignated, geographically remote installation or location. Evacuation
    management includes the phased or simultaneous return of evacuees to on-post residences or businesses
    during the recovery phase.
    H-3. Evacuation management also includes continuous communication to evacuees during the entire
    evacuation process, throughout mass care operations, and during the return of evacuees to their residences
    or workplaces on the installation. IEM programs may consider the establishment of an evacuation
    management team to coordinate the evacuation of personnel, their families, and pets to a shelter, safe
    haven, or other designated location.

EVACUATION PLANNING
    H-4. The evacuation planning process includes identifying the available transportation networks and the
    capabilities and limitations of each of these transportation methods, especially the carrying capacity of
    proposed evacuation routes and existing or potential traffic bottlenecks or blockages caused by traffic
    congestion or natural occurrences, such as rising waters. It is important to keep in mind that destructive
    weather and seismic events may limit or completely eliminate some transportation methods, especially
    bridges, ferries, tunnels, and some mass transit systems.
    H-5. Demographic information collected during the planning phase is integral to coordinating and
    executing an effective evacuation effort. Prior knowledge of the population, their locations, and their
    resource needs (for example, vulnerable populations that may lack transportation or the ability to receive
    information through common lines of communication) is pivotal in determining the nature and magnitude
    of the evacuation assistance needed.
    H-6. In addition, if efforts during the preparedness phase to build a resilient and well-informed community
    are successful, much of the protected population may be able to orchestrate a relatively efficient self-
    evacuation when there is sufficient notice of the event. Self-evacuating community members still need the

Appendix H



      benefit of full communication efforts on the nature of the risk and the best methods for evacuation (routes,
      safe-haven locations, resources). They also require some assistance with infrastructure preparedness, such
      as the contraflow of roads and highways, debris removal, and notification of any bridge or tunnel closures
      due to high winds, flooding, or other incidents.
      H-7. The evaluation of available evacuation routes is a key component of evacuation planning and directly
      impacts the clearance time of an installation or evacuation zone within an installation. Evacuation planning
      entails establishing primary and secondary evacuation routes and having these routes clearly marked and
      well lit. Evacuation routes include the preevent fielding of evacuation route markers and/or signs, which
      can be easily read during an emergency (low-light conditions, rain/ash fall conditions).
      H-8. The designation of evacuation routes is closely coordinated with the state/local evacuation plan to
      mitigate conflicting routes. Note that the installation population may not have been considered during the
      development of the state/local evacuation plan and analysis of clearance times. The determination of
      evacuation routes is also closely coordinated with the Department of Public Works and synchronized with
      published preincident plans so that families and individuals can use that information in developing their
      family or individual preparedness plans.
      H-9. In determining potential evacuation routes, consider the following:
              The road capacity/load.
              Sufficient width to accommodate the number of evacuating personnel.
              The route is clear and unobstructed at all times.
              The route is unlikely to expose evacuating personnel to additional hazards.
              Services along the route such as fuel, food, lodging (hotels, remote safe havens/shelters).
              Does the road lead to or contain a bridge, tunnel, or flood zone? This may have an impact on
               clearance time, especially for certain types of vehicles (for example, travel trailers, campers,
               motor homes, buses, motorcycles, and bicycles).
              Evacuation routes can also include waterways, railroads, and airfields, depending on the
               availability of boats, trains, and airplanes/helicopters, respectively.
              Use of reverse laning and contraflow (authorized/directed change of traffic pattern) to increase
               the load of a given route. Challenges to contraflow include increased signage, increased
               manpower for control, and acceptable entrance and exit points.
      H-10. Evacuation may require extensive coordination with multimodal transportation assets, including
      DOD, private, or state/local/federal providers. Transportation assets can come in many forms and from
      many sources. A large portion of an installation population may not have access to transportation and
      would need transportation assistance. Examples of potential transportation assets include the following:
               Personal vehicles (cars, sport utility vehicles, travel trailers, campers, motor homes, motorcycles,
                bicycles, and boats).
               Motor pool assets.
               Mass transit (buses, rail).
               Ferries.
               Air assets.
               Port assets.
               National Guard.
               MAAs, MOUs, and ISSAs.
      H-11. Each type of transportation asset may have limitations, depending on the hazard. These limitations
      are considered in planning evacuation and determining clearance time. The use of some or all of these
      transportation methods during certain emergencies—especially those involving flooding, high winds,
      multiple aftershocks, or volcanic eruption—may be unadvisable and result in blocking the progress of the
      evacuation. For example, buses are subject to driving restrictions over bridges during high winds. During a
      hurricane evacuation, with wind speeds increasing over time, evacuation plans do not rely on buses or other
      large transport vehicles crossing bridges after a certain point in the progression of the hurricane system
      toward the area. EPI broadcasts include any prohibitions on the use of these transportation methods.



H-2                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                               26 April 2013
                                                                 Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, and Lockdown



    H-12. Evacuation (vulnerability) zones provide a foundation to model traffic movements from one
    geographic area to another. It is necessary to include storm surge modeling in the development of the
    evacuation zones and to revise these zone models as information changes or is refined based on exercises or
    real events. Evacuation zones are designed to meet several functions; for example—
              They reflect the areas in each storm scenario which will need to be evacuated due to storm surge
               inundation.
              They relate as closely as possible to available population data information.
              The location and vulnerability of evacuation zones are clearly defined for the protected
               population to promote efficient evacuation.

EVACUATION OPERATIONS
    H-13. The timely issuance of evacuation orders directly affects the successful evacuation of all designated
    personnel. In determining the proper timeframe to issue evacuation orders, consider the weather, traffic,
    shelter, geographic, and political conditions at the evacuation sites, on the designated evacuation route(s),
    and at the receiving relocation site(s). Preevent evacuation route management with federal, state, local,
    other Service, and/or private agencies and the preevent designation of relocation site(s) and coordination
    with external shelter and safe- haven providers play a critical role in the management of evacuation
    operations. For events with adequate warning, evacuation orders are issued when school is not in session
    and when there are at least 8 hours of daylight included in the evacuation time allowed. For more
    information on evacuation plans and operations, see the Department of Transportation/Federal Highway
    Administration primer on Using Highways During Evacuation Operations for Events With Advance
    Notice.
    H-14. There are two main types of evacuation orders, and the determination of which order to issue is based
    on the severity of the hazard, the risk to the population, and the criticality of personnel to the EM effort:
              Mandatory evacuation. This is an ordered, nonelective evacuation. Designated mission-critical
               personnel are exempt from evacuation orders as required.
              Voluntary evacuation. When danger to personnel is remote, but the loss of services is possible,
               a voluntary evacuation may be authorized. Designated mission-critical and mission-essential
               personnel may be required/requested to remain on base for emergency response and recovery.
    H-15. In the event of an evacuation order, it is important to work with mission-critical and mission-
    essential personnel to ensure the safety of their family members who are evacuating without them. If they
    have any concerns about the ability of their family members to evacuate without them, they will be less
    compliant with orders or requests to remain on base.
    H-16. Clearance time refers to the time required to clear all evacuees from the evacuation routes and
    complete movement to the shelter, safe-haven, or designated receiving relocation site(s). Clearance time
    begins with the evacuation order, continues as the first evacuating vehicle enters the transportation
    network, and ends when the last evacuating vehicle reaches its destination. Clearance time includes the
    time required by evacuees to secure their homes and prepare to leave (mobilization time), the time spent by
    evacuees traveling along the road network (travel time), and the time spent by evacuees waiting along the
    road network due to traffic congestion (delay time). Clearance time does not refer to the time that a single
    vehicle spends traveling on the road network. Note that there may be a decision cutoff point when the
    projected clearance time exceeds the time to the onset of the emergency. When that occurs, the area does
    not evacuate and personnel shelter in place or use a local safe haven.
    H-17. In calculating clearance times, the participation and occupancy rates of an area are taken into
    account. Assuming 100 percent participation in the evacuation and 100 percent occupancy of residences in
    the area increases clearance time. However, if clearance time is calculated under the assumption that not all
    residents will heed the evacuation orders or that the installation and its surrounding area are not at
    maximum capacity, the calculation is significantly less.
    H-18. In overseas locations, evacuations follow established DOS evacuation procedures available via the
    appropriate embassy. Outside the United States and at forward operating bases, IEM plans include a section
    that provides evacuation procedures for noncombatant evacuation operations.



26 April 2013                 ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              H-3
Appendix H



      H-19. Mass casualty management requires greater numbers of medical treatment personnel to provide
      emergency care. A mass casualty situation exists when the number of patients requiring care exceeds the
      capabilities of initial responder medical personnel or resources. Medical responders make snap decisions on
      how to best manage the casualties to provide the best care for the greatest number. In the event that patient
      numbers exceed local capacity for care and treatment, a mass casualty scenario turns into a patient
      evacuation problem, which requires many of the same plans, assets, and resources as other evacuations.
      H-20. The installation fire department or emergency medical services (EMS) normally provide medical
      evacuation from the incident site to the nearest MTF. When organic installation EMS are not available,
      MOAs may be established with the off-installation EMS for the provision of these services. Deployable
      medical evacuation assets may also be employed in patient evacuation.
      H-21. As outlined in DODI 6200.03, the PHEO or his designee assesses the public health aspects of
      evacuation management, including noncombatant evacuation operations, so that the impact on the health
      and well-being of the vulnerable population is reduced. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, the medical
      commander or PHEO/assistant PHEO—
               Executes patient care plans and medical MAAs for patient care, medical facilities, and
                equipment.
               Coordinates and provides medical first responder capabilities, emergency care, mass casualty
                care, triage, first receiver care, patient movement, psychological support, and pharmacy, dental,
                and veterinary services
               Develops patient care, fatality management, and health care system evacuation plans and
                procedures appropriate in all-hazards responses (including mass casualty, isolation, and
                quarantine incidents).

RETURN FROM EVACUATION
      H-22. Depending on the impact of the incident and the progress of the subsequent essential-service
      restoration efforts, conditions may stabilize to a point that it is safe for some personnel to move back to
      their original locations. Based on the feedback from reconnaissance, the installation commander may deem
      it safe for personnel to return to their original duty stations. These returning personnel need to be kept
      updated on safe and available routes of movement as the recovery efforts continue. A well-executed and
      widely disseminated COP significantly improves installation ability to keep evacuation and reentry
      operations running smoothly.
      H-23. Returning from an evacuation requires extensive planning efforts. Evacuees returning to their homes
      or work centers in evacuated areas require the same consideration, coordination, and control as they
      received during the original evacuation. Some additional considerations are the availability of utilities,
      extent of debris removal, structure inspection and approval for safe occupancy, availability of adequate
      water for firefighting, and notification of local authorities regarding an increase in traffic flow to the
      installation.

SHELTER-IN-PLACE
      H-24. An installation ensures the capability to prepare for, ensure communication of, and immediately
      execute the safe and effective SIP of an at-risk population. SIP means to take immediate shelter without
      moving to a new location–this could be at home, at work, at school, or in a vehicle in between. A SIP plan
      and checklist for businesses and residences can be found on the Ready America Web site
      <http://www.ready.gov/business/plan/shelterplan.html>.
      H-25. In emergencies with limited or no warning time, temporary SIP within the individual’s workplace or
      residence is the preferred protective action to avoid casualties and fatalities. SIP procedures use existing
      buildings, residences, vessels, and vehicles to protect personnel from hazards when it is not practical or
      feasible to evacuate personnel in a timely manner. These locations are not certified as shelters and are
      staffed only by those personnel present.




H-4                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                              26 April 2013
                                                                 Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, and Lockdown



    H-26. SIP may be required for a natural disaster, such as a storm or earthquake, or for an incident where
    chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants are released into the environment. SIP to contain the
    spread of an illness in a public health emergency is referred to as isolation and quarantine.
    H-27. A recommendation order to start SIP also requires a follow-up recommendation to end SIP at the
    appropriate time. Occupants ideally relocate to a reception center located outside of the hazard area once
    the hazard has subsided to an appropriate level. If the shelter is not vacated in a timely fashion, occupants
    can be exposed to lingering low levels of contaminants.
    H-28. SIP also has the collateral benefits of allowing on-scene responders to focus on lifesaving actions for
    people who are outside when the hazard or threat strikes and of providing responders additional time to
    isolate damaged infrastructure (for example, downed power lines, broken fuel mains). This focus is
    possible since responders do not have to manage large crowds of evacuated personnel or deal with
    personnel blocking emergency ingress routes.
    H-29. The types of hazards which most lend themselves initially to SIP are as follows:
             Destructive weather with little to no advance notice; for example, a tornado.
             Seismic event (but not a resultant tsunami if the seismic event occurred underwater).
             Utility failure (if not a prolonged outage).
             Terrorist-caused event or HAZMAT accident involving chemicals and/or biological agents.
             Terrorist or accidental radiological release.
             Civil disturbance (including an active shooter).
             Volcanic ash fall (depending on the expected time of arrival, amount, and duration and the
              availability of alternative sheltering locations).

SHELTER-IN-PLACE PLANNING
    H-30. The following actions ensure the successful execution of SIP:
             Install or implement mass warning notification systems.
             Implement a geographic information system-based map grid system on medium to large
              installations to facilitate the establishment of zones, and coordinate SIP data for buildings in
              those zones. If possible, tailor mass warning notification system procedures to these zones.
             Ensure that the installation and/or regional dispatch center has the means, authority, and
              procedures to activate a mass warning notification system that initiates SIP when directed by the
              IC or installation EOC.
             Coordinate emergency warning messages with public awareness training materials. Due to the
              short time available for emergency messages, there is little opportunity for these messages to
              explain what is meant by SIP; this understanding is provided in awareness training.
             Identify which buildings and structures are adequate for SIP and provide probable ICs (fire,
              security, environmental) with a list of the suitable and unsuitable structures available to them.
                  Avoid designating structures that have permanent openings and, thus, are not capable of
                   being isolated from outside air (via doors, windows, and secured ventilation systems).
                  Avoid structures that must maintain air exchange to keep inside airborne levels from
                   reaching unhealthy concentrations (typically industrial-process facilities). Also avoid
                   chemical and biological laboratories and chemical storage areas.
                  Identify the closest structures that can be secured for each of the four primary wind
                   directions (north, east, south, and west). Personnel should not move in the direction of the
                   hazard. Thus, the IC, dispatch center, or EOC monitors and provides the wind direction at
                   the hazardous event location so that the proper SIP location can be selected.
                  Notify personnel who work or live in structures that cannot be secured about information on
                   their alternative SIP locations.
                  Include the following as preferable building considerations: HVAC system that can be shut
                   down quickly, physical security including manual deadbolts, and locking windows.
                  Use areas with existing collective protection systems, if available.

Appendix H



                Establish SIP procedures that are consistent with evacuation procedures. SIP procedures include
                 on-scene plans, dispatch center procedures, building plans, zone procedures, and EOC
                 procedures.
                Consider developing SIP management teams for each building that has been predetermined as
                 adequate for SIP. The SIP management team consists of zone managers (for medium to large
                 installations), the EOC sheltering coordinator, and a minimum of four SIP members for each SIP
                 building, including the building emergency coordinator, floor monitor(s), door monitor(s), and
                 building manager/maintenance staff. As an initial step, it may be more practical to build on the
                 organizational structure and personnel already designated in fire evacuation plans. The SIP
                 management team organization is designed to expand and contract as needed to meet the needs
                 of the incident. One person can fulfill multiple roles, depending on manpower availability and
                 the nature and expected duration of the incident.

SHELTER-IN-PLACE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES
      H-31. As discussed in DODI 6200.03, the PHEO or designee plans and advises on the public health aspects
      of shelter in place so that the impact on the health and well-being of the vulnerable population is reduced
      during a public health emergency. The installation commander, in consultation with the PHEO, has the
      authority to declare a DOD public health emergency and to implement relevant emergency health powers
      (as outlined briefly below) to achieve the greatest public health benefit while maintaining operational
      effectiveness.

QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION
      H-32. If the nature of the incident involves an infectious disease, quarantine or isolation may be needed
      during the response and/or recovery phases to prevent contact between healthy populations and those
      infected, suspected of being infected with, an infectious disease, whether natural or intentional (such as a
      biological weapons attack). These decisions are made by the installation commander after consultation with
      the command senior medical advisor and/or PHEO and in coordination with the local CDC quarantine
      officer as outlined in DODI 6200.03.
      H-33. Quarantine involves the detention of an individual or group suspected of having been exposed to an
      infectious disease until it is deemed that they have escaped infection (usually once the incubation period
      has lapsed). Isolation is the separation of an infected individual from a healthy population. (The term is
      usually used to refer to patients in an MTF.)
      H-34. Installation commanders may use other forms of restriction of movement (ROM) to maintain
      operational effectiveness in the face of an infectious disease. The goal is to control the spread of the disease
      by restricting contact between healthy groups of personnel and those who have, or are suspected of having,
      contracted the disease. Personnel covered by ROM do not necessarily need to be removed from operations.
      Rather, ROM is implemented in such a way as to allow them to continue their mission. Again, these
      decisions are made with recommendations furnished by the command senior medical advisor and/or PHEO.

            Note. See DODI 6200.03; Field Manual for the Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent
            Casualties; Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Health Service Support in a
            Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment; FM 4-02.33; AFI 48-105; and
            Chief of Naval Operations Instruction (OPNAVINST) 6210.2 for detailed information.


LOCKDOWN
      H-35. Lockdown is an announced emergency protocol used as a security measure to confine and restrict
      movement. Included in the lockdown procedure are all military uniformed Services, federal employees,
      contractor personnel, dependents, or other people on an installation as a guest. Because of extenuating
      circumstances, all personnel remain constrained inside the nearest vehicle, structure, or building that
      provides a measure of protection.

    H-36. During lockdown, no person may enter or exit an area until the all clear is broadcast, unless
    movement is required to escape from a dangerous place or situation. All clear is announced over the
    installation warning and notification system or through verbal communication by leadership through F&ES
    or security forces. Lockdown is broadcast every 15 minutes until all clear is announced.

PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY
    H-37. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, installation commanders approve a process for personnel
    accountability during emergencies based on the procedures in DODI 3001.02. The personnel accountability
    process is executed immediately upon implementing an order for evacuation, shelter in place, or lockdown.
    All installation personnel, nonemployees (suppliers, visitors), and residents are made aware of the
    command decision for evacuation, SIP, lockdown, movement to a safe haven, or movement to a civilian
    shelter.
    H-38. This process identifies virtual (off-site phone number, interactive notification system, Web site, or
    collaborative portal) and physical rally points and provides them to all assigned personnel via community
    preparedness tools. The personnel accountability process also includes a method of accounting for
    nonemployees.

                                   Mass Care Operations
        Mass care operations consist of all community preparedness, interagency
        coordination, mass warning and notification, installation EOC, and field activities
        necessary to initiate and manage the care for personnel displaced for any duration due
        to any emergency. Mass care operations encompass a broad range of tasks that
        operate every aspect of a shelter or safe haven to meet the needs of a displaced
        population.

MASS CARE
    I-1. Mass care operations include meeting the needs of a displaced population by providing access to a
    shelter or safe haven, food and water, emergency supplies, emergency pharmaceuticals, and other goods
    from the time they are displaced until the time they return to the original residence or workplace. Sheltering
    can occur at civilian community shelters, at local or remote safe havens (on the installation itself or on a
    remote installation), or in a shelter-in-place scenario.
    I-2. Mass care also includes continuous communication to evacuees throughout mass care operations. In
    particular, up-to-date information is continuously provided to the displaced population about shelter
    locations, transportation options, mass feeding operations, points of distribution for emergency goods and
    pharmaceuticals, the evolution of the incident, and the extent and duration of displacement.
    I-3. Mass care procedures include the capability to activate and manage the following:
           Assistance center on the installation.
           Local safe-haven operations consisting of one or more facilities on the installation.
           Coordination with one or more civilian shelters provided by one or more civil jurisdictions.
           Remote safe-haven operations at one or more predesignated, geographically remote receiving
            installations.
           Mass feeding operations at one or more locations on the installation.
           Point of distribution (POD) operations for the distribution of goods and services at one or more
            locations.
           Installation call center (or information hotline) operations for the distribution of approved
            information to friends and family of evacuees, casualties, and fatalities.
           Preexisting hazard-specific shelter locations (tornado shelters, fallout shelters).
    I-4. Agreements with civilian authorities are established, when possible, to assist the installation
    population with mass care at local civilian locations. On the installation, basic mass care operations are also
    coordinated by organic assets, such as community assistance centers or family assistance centers that are
    usually directed by the department of morale, welfare, and recreation. Fleet and family support centers
    onboard Navy installations also have organic mass care capabilities that can be leveraged during an
    incident.
    I-5. For a checklist template to determine the suitability of a space for use as a functioning shelter, see
    American Red Cross (ARC) Form 6564 (Shelter Facility Survey). For other information on mass care,
    including mass feeding, see ESF 6 in the NRF and FEMA CPG-1-01. The ARC Disaster Services Program
    Guidance also has several helpful resources that are available online.

Appendix I



SAFE HAVENS
      I-6. Despite the existence of civilian shelters in the local community, installations are also prepared to
      provide and maintain short-term mass care services. These safe havens are able to accommodate the
      protected population on base during an emergency if it is still safe to remain on base, or they are able to
      protect a population from a neighboring base in the event that the incident is occurring elsewhere. Safe
      havens are able to operate for a short period of time before transportation to other, off-base
      accommodations is secured. The installation emergency manager and the mass care coordinator collaborate
      with providers of emergency assistance before an event in order to provide necessary assistance at a safe
      haven during an incident. Safe havens and other emergency family assistance centers are able to provide
      the following services as outlined in DODI 6055.17 and Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 10-023:
                Registration, tracking, and personnel locator assistance.
                Temporary lodging.
                Access to sanitary facilities, potable water, food, and sufficient lighting.
                Medical triage and information on available medical services.
                Family assistance center to integrate victim and family services.
                Behavioral health support and psychosocial services.
                Religious and pastoral care.
                Support services for special needs populations, including medical needs.
                Support services for animal needs.
                Communication about services available and the nature of the incident.
                Adequate security.
                Legal and financial assistance.
                Coordination with casualty and mortuary affairs.
                Transportation.
                Translation services.
                Child and youth services.
      I-7. Local safe havens are generally only capable of providing temporary mass care for 5–7 days. After
      72 hours (or less depending on the incident and the preparedness of the community), these temporary safe-
      haven residents are completely dependent on mass care operations for feeding, emergency supplies, shower
      and sanitary facilities, laundry services, and even clothing. Remote safe havens vary significantly, and the
      associated timeline for transition to temporary or permanent housing depends on the capabilities of the
      receiving DOD installation. During this period, it is imperative that installations quickly identify temporary
      housing, on- and off-post and if available on nearby DOD installations in which to relocate safe-haven
      residents. Constant, honest engagement with safe haven residents on the process and the expected timeline
      is a key component of the ongoing EPI process.
      I-8. The safe-haven management team is responsible for the coordination of safe-haven operations. The
      safe haven management team plans how to accommodate small- and large-scale evacuation operations for
      people sent to or seeking local or remote safe havens. The general rules for safe-haven operation and
      special instructions are prepared, distributed, and available in each safe haven. The special instructions
      include capacity; facility employees and their family members who will seek shelter in the safe-haven
      facility; a list of preassigned personnel designated to the safe haven; limits of the safe-haven area; proposed
      layout; and the location of communications facilities, emergency equipment, and utility cutoffs. Telephone
      directory and emergency communications procedures are also available. The safe-haven management team
      works in coordination with the evacuation management team as described in appendix H.

MASS CARE PLANNING
      I-9. The mass care planning process includes identifying the available facilities and services which exist
      on the installation and coordinating the use of such facilities and services during the response and recovery
      operations. The identification of facilities and services to be used during mass care operations requires the
      determination of service capabilities and capacities, the movement of personnel and providers to and from



I-2                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                26 April 2013
                                                                                       Mass Care Operations



    designated locations (or services to and from designated PODs), and the necessary supporting infrastructure
    (vehicles, communications, utilities, generators, compressed gas, information technology) required to
    provide the given service at the given location during emergency conditions.
    I-10. As with evacuation management, planning for mass care operations relies heavily on the
    demographic information collected during the planning phase. Mass care planning for an installation also
    involves determining what organic resources are available to the installation for maintaining safe havens
    and what other resources are available in the neighboring community for the mass care of evacuated
    installation populations.
    I-11. Mass care planning incorporates—
            Community preparedness awareness and training.
            Mass warning and notification system procedures.
            Continued EPI throughout the response and recovery phases.
            Personnel accountability procedures consistent with DODI 3001.02.
            Facility management procedures, to include the use of pre- and postincident signage, parking
             management, access control, accountability, cost accounting, transportation services, and
             utility/power services for identified mass care locations/facilities.
            Procedures and resources for registration, personnel tracking/accountability, security, health
             services, volunteer management, distribution of goods, client services (legal, insurance, travel,
             temporary housing, school registration, counseling services), shower/bathroom services, laundry
             services, child support/daycare services, pet management, and waste management services.
            Procedures and resources for the provision of fuel, water, and emergency supplies to identified
             local and remote safe havens and through the use of PODs.
            Procedures for supporting and managing medical access and special needs populations, and
             personnel with psychological effects.
            Procedures for providing transportation assistance to and from mass care locations/facilities for
             populations without access to transportation.
            Procedures for non-English-speaking personnel and the visually and hearing impaired.
            Procedures for further evacuation in case the incident expands or a second incident occurs.
            Template mass care information sheets in multiple languages with locations of local safe havens,
             civilian shelters, and PODs and information on community assistance center services.
            Template safe-haven resident information sheets in multiple languages with rules and guidelines
             for local safe havens, to include standardized policies on registration, children, personal
             belongings, mobile phone use, animals/pets, smoking, alcohol, drugs, weapons, quiet hours,
             music/video player/game use, parking, volunteers, security, and health services.
    I-12. Populations in urban environments with lower household income and/or with the lowest fear of
    property security (that their home will be protected by LE while away) are the most likely to seek a public
    safe haven or civilian shelter when impacted by an emergency or when directed to move to a safe haven or
    civilian shelter by authorities. For example, these categories may encompass junior enlisted personnel,
    barracks populations, and family housing area residents. Refer to FEMA Community Mass Care
    Management Course for more information.
    I-13. The safe-haven management team determines suitable locations for safe havens using the following
    guidance and presents their findings to the IEMWG for approval by the installation commander. Although
    not all of the following considerations/needs must be met, safe havens strive to include as many as
    possible:
             Safe and secure location.
             Suitable space for sleeping quarters.
             Secured storage areas.
             Suitable space for people with pets.
             Adequate supply of drinking water (5 gallons/person/day).
             Adequate toilet and bathing facilities (1 toilet/40 people).

Appendix I



                Provisions for cooking and serving food, if possible.
                Fire and police protection.
                Adequate parking.
                Exterior walls made of concrete block or reinforced concrete.
                Load-bearing interior walls.
                Doorframes securely attached to the structure and properly braced.
                Windows with impact protection from flying debris.
                Personnel areas located away from unprotected windows and doors.
                Structure able to resist wind uplift forces.
                Properly attached roof cladding.
                Finished floors at least 15 feet above mean sea level for coastal areas and at least 15 feet above
                 floodplain level for inland areas. (A structurally sound, multifloor building that is less than 15
                 feet above mean sea level may still be used as a safe haven with occupancy on floors above that
                 minimum.)
                Inside stairwells and ready access to exits.
                No hazardous utility lines (steam, gas, oil) located in or near the safe haven (unless provision is
                 made to control such hazards via valve alignment or other means).
                No units of access and egress less than 28 inches wide. At least two widely separated means of
                 egress.
                Emergency power.
                Appropriate size (consider facilities such as churches or restaurants for up to 100 people and
                 schools, hotels, conference centers, and sport complexes for more than 100 people).
                Facility compliance with AT standards.
      I-14. Electrical power may or may not be available from normal sources in a disaster situation; however,
      consideration is given to the use of local, unit, and installation portable emergency generators to provide
      power to safe havens. Where such generators are included in safe-haven plans, the plans also include a 2-
      week fuel supply, emergency refueling procedures for each generator, and the electrical tie-in of the
      generators to minimum-essential operational and environmental circuitry. Portable generators must never
      be operated indoors, or deadly levels of carbon monoxide can accumulate. See the OSHA fact sheet at
      <http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_Hurricane_Facts/portable_generator_safety.pdf >.

RAPID NEEDS ASSESSMENT
      I-15. In order to quickly identify postincident mass care, medical care, public health, and behavioral health
      needs, installations develop and execute a rapid needs assessment process. The
      International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has published a Disaster
      Emergency Needs Assessment training tool and accompanying checklists that can be a useful guide
      in tailoring a rapid needs assessment process for an installation. The tool can be found at
      <http://www.ifrc.org/Global/Disemnas.pdf>.
      I-16. Rapid needs assessments are designed to quickly provide accurate and inexpensive population-based
      information needed to match a community’s mass care needs with the available resources. Early
      assessments combined with rapid mobilization of resources can significantly reduce human suffering and
      the potential for secondary medical, public health, and behavioral health impacts.

ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS
      I-17. Persons with transportation needs include any individual who, by reason of illness, injury, age,
      congenital malfunction, or other permanent or temporary incapacity or disability, is unable without special
      facilities or special planning or design to use mass transportation facilities as effectively as persons who are
      not so affected. Within the transportation needs category, those with access and functional needs differ in
      severity and extent of disabilities; the way in which other people view their physical and mental limitations;
      and their income, age, and mobility. Persons with transportation needs are those who find it difficult to



I-4                  ATP 3-11.42/MCWP 3-38.1/NTTP 3-11.36/AFTTP 3-2.83                                 26 April 2013
                                                                                         Mass Care Operations



    evacuate without aid from community members, caretakers, family members, friends, or rescue workers.
    Persons with transportation needs often include the elderly and people with disabilities and can include
    persons with medical needs. Persons with transportation needs also include fully mobile people who have
    no means of transportation off the installation. This may be due to lack of financial capability to pay for
    public transportation, or, where none exists, may be due to a lack of a vehicle (such as, a car).
    I-18. Persons with medical needs include those with potentially life-threatening conditions and/or chronic
    medical/physical conditions requiring specialty care or follow-up support more than once a year. Medical
    needs persons also include those with current and chronic behavioral health conditions, those who have
    required inpatient or intensive outpatient behavioral health service from any provider within the last five
    years or at the present time. Other qualifications include a diagnosis of asthma or other respiratory-related
    diagnosis with chronic recurring wheezing which meets specified criteria and a diagnosis of attention
    deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that meets the specified criteria, requires adaptive
    equipment, requires assistive technology devices or services, and/or requires environmental/architectural
    considerations.
    I-19. All persons with access and functional needs must have access to the same safe havens as persons
    without access and functional needs. Although not required, if deemed appropriate by the IEM, safe havens
    for persons with access and functional needs may be set up; however, all other safe havens still accept
    persons with access and functional needs. The IEMWG considers the following in planning for those with
    access and functional needs:
             Ensure accessible entrances, toilet and bathroom facilities, and safe haven area for those with
              wheelchairs and scooters.
             Ensure adequate refrigeration or cooler availability for those with medications.
             Ensure safe haven staff are properly trained to assist those with access and functional needs
              before a disaster strikes.
             Include persons with access and functional needs in safe havens; persons with access and
              functional needs should not be separated from any other persons in the safe haven except where
              necessary due to conflicts with companion animals and persons with allergies.
             Allow companion animals, seeing animals, retrieval animals, and all other pets that assist access
              and functional needs persons into the safe haven, and allow the animals to remain with their
              owners.
             Ensure availability of generators.
             Ensure that all safe haven information and announcements are accessible to those who are deaf,
              hard of hearing, blind, or visually impaired.

ANIMAL NEEDS MANAGEMENT
    I-20. A plan for addressing the needs and care of animals in the event of an evacuation is also developed
    for each IEM program. Whether pets are to be allowed in a safe haven is the decision of the installation
    commander. If pets are allowed in remote safe havens, there is a signed agreement between the two
    installations.
    I-21. Keeping animals and their owners together is a way of reducing stress on disaster victims. Dealing
    with separated owners and their animals can become a predominant issue in large-scale evacuations. Close
    cooperation with the animal-care community is the best way to plan for and respond to these issues. Local
    community veterinarians and animal control or humane shelter directors can be asked to coordinate
    evacuations and rescues of animals in an organized manner.

COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE CENTER
    I-22. IEM programs establish procedures for creating a community assistance center (or similar center) to
    provide services based upon the needs of the specific emergency. The community assistance center (or
    similar) provides the following services:
              Mass care registration services.
              Personnel accountability liaison.

Appendix I



               Volunteer management service.
               Donations management service.
               Support services for non-English-speaking, hearing impaired, visually impaired, and physically
                impaired populations.
               Information on safe haven and civilian shelter locations, transportation routes and services,
                laundry locations, shower/bath facility locations, PODs, and utilities and power outages.
               Service liaisons: health services, access and functional needs populations, animal needs
                populations, utility providers (gas, water, power, waste management), and U.S. Postal Service.
               Client services: individual assistance programs, legal counsel, banking services, insurance claim
                services, travel services (aviation, rail, bus, ferry, and rental cars), school/childcare/daycare
                registration, counseling services, and housing coordination services.

PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS
      I-23. As outlined in DODI 6200.03, the PHEO or his designee plans for and advises on the public health
      aspects of mass care and access and functional needs populations so that the impact on the health and well-
      being of the vulnerable population is reduced during a public health emergency.
      I-24. Consistent with DODI 6055.17, DOD installations develop a mass prophylaxis plan for ensuring the
      mass distribution of prophylactic and/or curative medications during a public health emergency. In
      executing mass prophylaxis, each installation leverages its own inherent capability as well as the
      capabilities of supporting resources (for example, civilian institutions, local health departments, or access
      to the Strategic National Stockpile [SNS]). Medical logistics tracks mass prophylaxis and other medical
      supplies.
      I-25. Logistics, facilities, security, and medical support functions coordinate a unified effort to set up one
      or more PODs for the allocation of prophylactic and/or curative medications. The location and supply of
      PODs is usually coordinated with parallel civilian support functions, since receipt and distribution of
      medications and supplies within the SNS is coordinated with the state or local entity governing SNS
      distribution, as discussed in the interagency agreement between DOD and Department of Health and
      Human Services on the support of contingency medical materiel requirements.

            Note. Marine Corps installations are prohibited from serving as open PODs for the general
            public.
