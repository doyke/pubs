   use” facility with SAFB to the West and MAA to the East.
   2.2.2. Airfield Property Lines. Silver Creek defines the Eastern separation of properties
   between MAA and SAFB. However, until 2025, MAA is responsible for maintenance of
   taxiway (TWY) Golf pavement from the western edge of the tunnels under the TWY,
   extending East to their previously defined area of responsibility.
   2.2.3. SAFB’s center of the airfield is located at coordinates: N 38°32’38.55” W 89°
   51’09.36”. Field elevation for SAFB/MAA is 459’ above Mean Sea Level (MSL).
2.3. Runway, Taxiways and Aprons. See Attachment 2.
   2.3.1. RWY14R/32L and supporting airfield data at SAFB. Portions of SAFB were
   constructed to varied standards to include Pre-United Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01,
   Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, criteria, UFC 3-260-01 criteria and Federal
   Aviation Administration (FAA) standards. The airfield is maintained to current UFC criteria
   with some pre-UFC configurations permanently waived by Headquarters (HQ) AMC.
   2.3.2. RWY 14R/32L is made up of grooved asphalt and concrete, 8,011’ long, 150’ wide
   with the first 25’ of the shoulders being non-stressed asphalt. The first 2,001’ of RWY 14R
   (North end) has a concrete touchdown zone; RWY 32L (South end) has an asphalt
   touchdown zone.
       2.3.2.1. RWY 14R has 8,011’ available for landing and takeoffs and no overrun.
       2.3.2.2. RWY 32L threshold is displaced 200’, leaving 7,811’ available for landing and
       8,011’ for takeoffs. The departure end of RWY 32L has a 1,000’ long by 150’ wide
       asphalt overrun.
       2.3.2.3. The elevation at RWY 14R threshold is 459’ MSL and the elevation at RWY
       32L threshold is 437’ MSL.
       2.3.2.4. Only aircraft weighing less than 41,000 lbs are authorized 180-degree turns on
       RWY 14R/32L asphalt surface. Aircraft approved to make 180-turns on the asphalt
       portion of the runway must do so at taxi speed with no locked wheels.
   2.3.3. RWY 14L/32R (MAA runway). RWY 14L/32R is a grooved concrete RWY 10,000’
   long, 150’ wide, with 12’ of their shoulder being paved with non-stressed asphalt and no

     2.3.3.2. The threshold elevations for RWY 14L and 32R are 442’ MSL.
  2.3.4. The Runway Safety Area (RSA) is defined as an area 250’ either side RWY 14R/32L
  and 14L/32R centerlines (500’ in total width) extending for 1000’ beyond the end of each
  runway. This area was designated to enforce Title 14 CFR, Part 139 requirements for no
  men or equipment operations occurring in the RSA while air carrier operations are in
  progress. This is further restricted for application purposes here at SAFB/MAA as no men or
  equipment will be within the RSA when any aircraft operations are in progress thus
  eliminating the potential for error.
  2.3.5. Taxiways/taxilanes.
     2.3.5.1. Alpha (A). Concrete and parallels the entire length of RWY 14R/32L. It is 75’
     wide with 12’ of the shoulder being paved with non-stressed asphalt. TWY Alpha

     RWY 14L/32R is made of concrete 75’ wide with 12’ of their shoulder being paved with
     non-stressed asphalt.
     2.3.5.4. Taxilane Romeo (R). Taxilane Romeo is asphalt, 75’ wide and has no paved
     shoulders. Note: Taxilane Romeo is designated as such to indicate it is only being
     provided transient apron edge separation criteria as it is primarily used to taxi aircraft into
     and out of parking Spot 31.
     2.3.5.5. MAA Supporting TWY Data. TWYs Mike, Kilo, Lima, Golf, November, and
     Papa at MAA are concrete 75’ wide and have 12’ of the shoulder being paved with non-
     stressed asphalt. TWY Golf from TWY Kilo to Golf Ramp is only 60’ wide with 8’ of its
     shoulders paved with non-stress asphalt.
  2.3.6. Aprons. For general information; the military apron on the West side of the airfield is
  called the main apron. For further delineation it is broken down into Spots 1-7 being called
  the North Apron, Spots 13-15 the Distinguished Visitor (DV) Apron, and Spots 16-29 the
  South Apron. The military apron between the runways is referred to as the 126 ARW Apron
  or ANG Apron. The MAA aprons are referred to as the civil aprons and are further broken
  down and named by the taxiway that leads into the apron (Golf, Mike and November
  aprons).
     2.3.6.1. Foxtrot (F). Foxtrot Apron originally got its name from being a taxiway that
     was changed. It is referred to as Foxtrot Apron between Taxiways Echo and Golf; it is
     referred to as South Foxtrot Ramp from Taxiway Golf South. There is a spur that jets out
     to the West of South Foxtrot Apron that is referred to as West Foxtrot Ramp. Foxtrot
     Apron is 150’ wide with no paved shoulder, South Foxtrot Apron is 150’ wide and have

   designated the calm wind instrument runway.
2.5. Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
   2.5.1. CMA Description.
      2.5.1.1. The CMA on the military side of the airfield West of Silver Creek is as follows:
      extends 1000’ either side of RWY 14R/32L centerline and extends to the jogging path on
      the North end of the airfield and to the railroad tracks on the South end of the airfield.
      The exceptions are the base golf course on the East side of the airfield, Hangar Road
      where it passes fire station 1 on the West side of the airfield and 200’ either side of TWY
      Golf from Golf Apron (MAA Side) to just East of Foxtrot Apron. See Attachment 2 for
      a depiction of the area.
      2.5.1.2. The CMA on the civil side of the airfield East of Silver Creek is as follows:
      extends 650 feet either side of RWY 14L/32R centerline and extends to just past the
      Instrument Landing System (ILS) Localizer on the North end of the airfield and 1000 feet
      off the South end of the threshold to RWY 32R.
      2.5.1.3. All TWYs located in the area described above are inside the CMA.
   2.5.2. The ATCT is the controlling agency for aircraft, vehicles, and pedestrians entering the
   CMA. The only acceptable means of accessing the CMA is via two-way radio
   communications, prior to entering and maintaining contact until leaving the area. When
   operating on the CMA, operators will use the Tower Talk Group to communicate with the
   ATCT. During airfield emergencies, Scott and MAA fire vehicles will communicate with
   the ATCT on the Fire 1 talk group also referred to as the Crash Net. In the event of lost
   communication with ATCT while operating on the CMA light gun signals will be utilized
   IAW SAFB Instruction 13-213, Airfield Driving Instructions. Note: SAFB Ramps and
   aircraft parking aprons are uncontrolled movement areas. The MAA Golf and Mike Ramps
   are limited access and require approval from the MAA AOC via the Ramp Talk Group prior
   to entry. The MAA November Ramp is a secure area, only MAA approved vehicles and
   individuals with an MAA media identification access are authorized onto the November
   Ramp without escort. An AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency, flight line driver card
   does not authorize access to MAA’s Ramps unless it has been previously coordinated with

           only basis are allowed to park on Spots 17 thru 20. All vehicles on the flightline
           access road just West of the parking spots must stop in a position to allow at least
           a 25ft wing tip clearance while the aircraft is taxiing into or out of parking.
           Transient alert will ensure vehicles are holding as required before authorizing the
           aircraft to move. Additionally, if an aircraft of any size is parked to the North
           side of the taxiing C-130 a wing walker must be used to ensure wingtip clearance

        AIRCRAFT CONTACT ATS ON UNICOM FREQUENCY 122.95.” Note: The
        command post shall not issue taxi instructions, but serve as a coordination agency to
        assist ACs until tower has returned to operation.
        6.11.1.1.3. Determine where ATC personnel will relocate using the WS Ready
        Reference File (RRF). This location is normally on the first floor in front of the
        elevator for high winds/severe weather, or the West corner of the parking lot for
        bomb threats, fire, etc.
        6.11.1.1.4. Transfer control of all airborne VFR/IFR aircraft to STL Approach
        Control and complete applicable checklists in the WS RRF.
        6.11.1.1.5. Set airfield lighting IAW the WS RRF.
     6.11.1.2. Upon notification of the ATCT evacuation, AM will:
        6.11.1.2.1. Activate the SCN and pass all known information.
        6.11.1.2.2. Advise MAA AOC to transmit NOTAMs closing RWY 14R/32L and a
        separate NOTAM closing the ATCT.
     6.11.1.3. Only emergency response vehicles are permitted on the CMA.           AM has
     approval authority for other vehicles.
     6.11.1.4. NAVAIDS internal monitoring capabilities will be relied upon IAW AFI 13-
     204V3.
     6.11.1.5. MAA RWY 14L/32R, TWYs and aprons will remain open, but uncontrolled.
     Note: AFI 13-204V3 requires closing the SAFB portion of the airfield (RWY 14R/32L
     and all TWYs, ramps and aprons West of the Silver Creek Bridge) to all aircraft activity
     when the ATCT, AM or both are closed. Operation Noble Eagle Missions have AMC
     waiver allowing movement.
  6.11.2. AM Evacuation.

6.12. SAFB Fire/Crash Status and Aircraft Operating Restrictions.
   6.12.1. SAFB/MAA fire fighting capability will be reported IAW the Aircraft Rescue and
   Fire Fighting (ARFF) capability matrices in Attachments 3 and 4 of AFI 32-2001, Fire
   Emergency Services Program, and AFI 13-204V3 AMC Supplement, Attachment 20, Table
   20-1.
   6.12.2. ARFF Levels of Service. Actions as outlined in Attachment 10 will be
   implemented in conjunction with the reported levels of service below:
      6.12.2.1. Optimum Level of Service (OLS): The OLS is available when 90 to 100
      percent of the manpower and 90 percent of required agent are available. During OLS for
      aircraft fires, fire fighting forces can expect success when the fire is limited to a single
      aircraft and all fire fighting agent is available.
      6.12.2.2. Reduced Level of Service (RLS): The RLS is when available resources are less
      than the OLS requirements but greater than CLS. This varying level of service allows
      adequate fire ground capability based on historic emergency response data and the most
      probable major fire emergency event. This level of service would be expected and
      acceptable when resources are not available due to various circumstances such as AEF
      deployments, sick leaves, etc. During this level of service, adequate firefighting
      capability can be provided by utilizing cross staffing, selective response and sound fire
      ground tactics. For aircraft fires, fire fighting forces can expect success when all fire
      fighting agent is available and the fire is limited to one location. However, initially
      responding firefighters may not be able to sustain emergency operations without
      supplemental resources.
      6.12.2.3. Critical Level of Service (CLS). The CLS is the absolute minimum level of
      service and is only permitted for short durations. During this level of service at least one
      appropriate firefighting vehicle and a minimum of seven firefighters must be available to
      respond to each FDZ within the emergency response time standard. For aircraft fires, fire
      fighting forces can provide initial fire suppression operations when at least one ARFF
      vehicle is available, the fire is limited to one location and the fire does not involve the
      aircraft’s fuel system. Firefighting crews may provide limited search and rescue, and
      property conservation during this period; however, these capabilities cannot be sustained
      without additional resources. Deviating below CLS is not permitted. If resources are not
      available to sustain CLS, the Fire Chief prepares an ORM plan.
      6.12.2.4. Inadequate Level of Service. Is not defined, except anything below CLS is
      considered an inadequate level of service. Below CLS, interior operations must be
      suspended except to perform rescue when at least four firefighters are available. Interior
      fire attack is not permitted unless a dedicated rapid intervention team is available.
   6.12.3. Restrictions to SAFB Flying Operations.
      6.12.3.1. The base is designated a Category 4 airfield for firefighting services and
      manned/equipped accordingly. An ARFF Operational Risk Management was conducted
      and multiple wings’ guidance is provided IAW Attachment 10 for all base assigned
      aircraft.
SCOTTAFBI13-204 30 JULY 2013                                                                  43


      6.12.3.2. The Scott AFB steady state Levels of Service for all base assigned aircraft
      categories (Cat 4 and below) operating on runway 14R/32L is OLS, and operating on
      runway 14L/32R is CLS. When ARFF capability to Rwy 14R/32L is reduced to CLS
      status or below, all abnormal and concurrent servicing fuel and LOX operations (per T.O.
      00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding) will be
      terminated on the military side of the airfield unless determined to be mission critical by
      the applicable wing commander. If operations are determined to be mission critical, the
      fire department must be notified a minimum of 15 minutes before the start of the
      operation and the fire chief will determine appropriate ARFF vehicle standby
      requirements.
      6.12.3.3. For transient aircraft the only difference for steady state are operations on
      runway 14R/32L. The steady state for Cat 5 and Cat 6 aircraft is RLS.
      6.12.3.4. Steady state conditions are published in Flight Information Publications and the
      AMC Giant Report for each category of aircraft.
      6.12.3.5. If the number of aircraft operations must be limited, the ATCT will use the
      aircraft priority criteria listed in ATCT instructions to determine which aircraft may
      start/continue operations.
      6.12.3.6. Sequencing and separation of aircraft remains the ATCT’s primary
      responsibility. IAW FAAO 7110.65T, monitoring and administering flying operations
      based on ARFF capability is considered a secondary service and accomplished on a
      workload permitting basis.
6.13. Aircraft Rescue and Fire-Fighting (ARFF) Notification Procedures.
   6.13.1. Notification Procedures for Reduced Fire-Fighting Capabilities.
      6.13.1.1. SAFB Fire Department will notify AM and the 375 AMW/CP daily with
      current ARFF capability for each runway. In addition, they will also notify AM and 375
      AMW/CP in a timely manner of any reduced fire-fighting capability in terms of amount
      of agent or number of personnel and estimated time of return to full capability.
      6.13.1.2. When the designated number of firefighting personnel or firefighting agent is
      outside the required numbers or response times based on the published steady state, the
      capability category falls and a report is made to personnel and agencies affected. This
      report is sent via NOTAMs and through direct communications with local flying
      organizations. AM will notify the following of reduced fire-fighting capability and
      estimated time of return to full capability if known:
          6.13.1.2.1. The 375 OSS/CC.
          6.13.1.2.2. ATCT.
          6.13.1.2.3. The 375 AMW/932 AW/CP.
          6.13.1.2.4. The 126 ARW/CP.
          6.13.1.2.5. TA.
          6.13.1.2.6. MAA AOC.

           6.13.1.2.7. NOTAMs will be sent using Attachment 10 to advertise the current
           airfield level of service and if known an estimated return to normal status.
           6.13.1.2.8. The need to report ARFF capability degradation due to off-airfield
           emergency responses is made at the discretion of the Senior Fire Officer based on the
           availability and speed by which crews can respond back to the airfield.
       6.13.1.3. The 375 AMW/CP will notify the following of reduced fire-fighting capability
       and the estimated time of return to full capability.
           6.13.1.3.1. The 375 OG/CC.
           6.13.1.3.2. The 375 AMW/CC.
       6.13.1.4. The 126 ARW/CP will notify 126 OG/CC. Note: the 126 ARW/CC, or
       equivalent, will maintain operations control of the 126 ARW aircraft using RWY 14L-
       32R.
       6.13.1.5. ATCT will notify STL TRACON and broadcast the DOD ARFF operations
       reduced capability on the DATIS.
6.14. Alternate Facility Procedures.
   6.14.1. AM. The alternate AM facility is located in the ATCT (Bldg 3900). It is equipped
   with an alternate SCN, all necessary landlines, radios, and LAN connections.
   6.14.2. ATC. No alternate ATC facility is available.
6.15. Hydrazine Aircraft Operations. Hydrazine is an odorless, colorless gas used in some
aircraft (i.e., F-16s) for auxiliary power. The gas is deadly to humans. Aircraft inbound to
SAFB/MAA with suspected Hydrazine leaks will be directed to turn off and exit the RWY at the
end, and hold this position until emergency response personnel deem the aircraft safe to move to
normal parking on the ramp.
   6.15.1. AM will close RWY 14R/32L to air traffic until the aircraft with the Hydrazine leak
   is declared safe.
   6.15.2. The MAA AOC will close RWY 14L/32R to aircraft operations until the aircraft is
   declared safe.

requirements.
9.4. Waivers to Airfield/Airspace Criteria. Airfield/Airspace waivers are reviewed annually
and briefed at the AOB. The 375 CES is the OPR for the Airfield Waiver Program and 375
OSS/OSA is the OPR for Airspace Criteria.
   9.4.1. Airfield Obstructions/Waivers. The 375 CES and the AFM determine obstructions in
   the navigable airspace at SAFB. The 375 CES and AM will use UFC 3-260-01 and Title 14
   CFR, Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace, when determining obstacle criteria.
SCOTTAFBI13-204 30 JULY 2013                                                                  51


      9.4.1.1. HQ AMC-waived obstructions must be revalidated bi-annually. The 375 CES
      initiates the annual waiver revalidation and identifies all items that fall within the
      imaginary surfaces listed in UFC 3-260-01, fully describes each item in the appropriate
      375 CES Tab, and initiates coordination for waiver action with 375 AMW/SE and 375
      OSS AOF/CC.
      9.4.1.2. Objects on the airfield West of Silver Creek deemed to be airspace/airfield
      obstructions must be reviewed and approved for waiver. Items identified by the HQ
      AMC and denied waiver approval will be programmed for removal.
      9.4.1.3. The 375 CES will initiate temporary airfield waiver action at least 45 days prior
      to the start of any construction project violating clearance criteria established in UFC 3-
      260-01 or Title 14 CFR, Part 77. The AFM, 375 AMW/SE and the 375 OSS AOF/CC
      must coordinate on temporary waivers before the 375 CES forwards them to the 375
      AMW/CC for approval.
   9.4.2. Airspace Waivers. The 375 AMW Airspace Manager (designated as the AOF/CC)
   must determine the need for airspace waivers, and submit all required paperwork to the
   Flight Standards District Office (FSDO-Dallas/Ft. Worth), the FAA Regional Office, and
   STL TRACON. The Airspace Manager will also submit notifications to the USAF IAW AFI
   13-201, Airspace Management. All waivers will be submitted and determined on a case-by-
   case basis (i.e., air shows, fly-bys, natural disasters, emergencies, etc).
9.5. Prior Permission Requested (PPR) Procedures.
   9.5.1. PPR is required due to limited aircraft parking facilities and the requirement to
   manage transient aircraft movement on the airfield. AM is the sole agent for issuing PPRs
   for transient aircraft to use any parking facility on SAFB.
      9.5.1.1. AM will complete Air Traffic Logging Automated System (ATLAS) PPR
      request for all transient aircraft requesting to use SAFB ramps. PPR requests will depict:
          9.5.1.1.1. Date and time of aircraft arrival/departure.
          9.5.1.1.2. Type of aircraft.
          9.5.1.1.3. Reason for stop at SAFB (i.e., gas and go, DV movement, AMC
          conference, etc.).
          9.5.1.1.4. Point of contact.
          9.5.1.1.5. DSN/commercial telephone number.
          9.5.1.1.6. Any DV movement or special servicing requirements.
      9.5.1.2. AM will approve PPR if there is sufficient parking space and if the aircraft
      arrives and departs within TA and/or AM operating hours.
   9.5.2. The 375 OSS/CC or designated representatives must approve PPRs for aircraft
   arriving after TA and or AM operating hours. Note: Transient aircraft may not park or
   depart from parking at SAFB without TA or maintenance assistance. Normally, PPR will be
   denied for routine cross-country flights (no DV on board or non-AMC mission aircraft)
   scheduled to arrive or depart after TA hours.
   9.5.3. The 375 AMW/CP and TA will be notified of all PPRs.
 52                                                       SCOTTAFBI13-204 30 JULY 2013


   9.5.4. The 126 ARW Transient Aircraft Coordination.
      9.5.4.1. Transient aircraft parking at the 126 ARW Ramp is for official business only and
      normally requires 48-hour advance PPR.
      9.5.4.2. Transient crews requesting parking at the 126 ARW Ramp must initiate the PPR
      request through 126 ARW/AM.
      9.5.4.3. AM will direct PPR request for transient aircraft parking on the 126 ARW Ramp
      to the 126 ARW/CP IAW IFR Supplement.
          9.5.4.3.1. The 126 ARW PPR approvals will be faxed to 375 OSS/AM for entry into
          ATLAS.
   9.5.5. TA will provide parking and other transient services if the aircraft arrives or departs
   during TA operating hours or if extended hours are approved.
   9.5.6. PPR is required for locally assigned C-21 and C-40 aircraft requiring DV parking in
   front of AM. Normally, TA provides transient services to base-assigned C-21 aircraft parked
   on Spots 13 through 15, provided the aircraft arrives or departs with a DV Code 6 or higher.
   Aircraft other than C-12 or C-21 wishing to park in DV parking are evaluated independently
   upon AM notification.
9.6. Arriving Air Evac Notification and Response Procedures. Upon notification/arrival of
any air evac aircraft, AM will notify the 375 AMW/CP. The CP will notify the clinic, fire
department, and rescue protection.
   9.6.1. Air Evac support crews must stage their vehicles (ambulance, ambulance bus, support
   vehicles, special equipment vehicle, etc.) on the South Apron of Hangar 1 until air evac
   aircraft are parked and engines shut down. Support crews shall wait until aircraft are safe
   and ready for their vehicles and crew members are in position to marshal the vehicles.
9.7. Unscheduled/Unauthorized Aircraft Arrivals.
   9.7.1. ATCT will solicit AM for permission to grant an unscheduled aircraft arrival.
   9.7.2. AM will grant or deny permission for unscheduled aircraft arrivals IAW AFI 10-1001,
   Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, OSAA OI 13-213, and local checklists.
   9.7.3. Unauthorized landings. (Refer to AFI 10-1001 and OSAA OI 13-213.)
      9.7.3.1. In the event an aircraft lands without permission and appears to be heading
      toward an area outside the designated Joint Use Area the ATCT and the AM will execute
      Unauthorized/Inadvertent Civilian Aircraft Landings checklists.
      9.7.3.2. Unauthorized landings present a distinct security risk to SAFB. If a pilot files a
      flight plan to and lands at SAFB without first obtaining prior permission, the 375
      AMW/CC or a designated representative may categorize the landing as unauthorized
      IAW AFI 10-1001 if it exits the designated joint use area onto DOD property without
      permission.
      9.7.3.3. When a civil aircraft, without a PPR requests permission to land, AM will
      inform ATCT that no prior approval has been obtained and the aircraft is to be denied
      landing rights if it plans to come to the military side of the airfield.
SCOTTAFBI13-204 30 JULY 2013                                                                      53


       9.7.3.4. If the pilot of a civil aircraft declares an emergency and needs to land at
       SAFB/MAA, the ATC WS/SC will allow the aircraft to land; direct him to clear the
       active runway and plan for it to go to the civilian side of the airfield
       9.7.3.5. AM will:
          9.7.3.5.1. Respond to the aircraft and coordinate with ATCT to ensure the aircraft is
          held in position until 375 SFS responds.
          9.7.3.5.2. Notify 375 SFS to dispatch a security team to the aircraft to maintain
          security of the aircraft and crew and, if necessary, to conduct follow-on actions as
          directed by the AOF/CC or designated representative.
          9.7.3.5.3. Notify the AOF/CC.
          9.7.3.5.4. Have TA provide a vehicle to the aircraft and standby to escort and/or park
          the aircraft.
       9.7.3.6. The AOF/CC or designated representative will proceed to the aircraft to
       determine landing validity.
       9.7.3.7. The responding representative will interview the pilot and obtain a written
       circumstantial report, copies of pilot’s license, driver’s license, aircraft registration, and
       copies of reports taken by other responders such as FAA, security forces, or secret
       service.
       9.7.3.8. Once the interview is completed the category of landing will be ascertained and
       appropriate landing fees will be assessed according to AFI 10-1001 and appropriate
       report sent to HAF Operations Directorate (A30/AC).
       9.7.3.9. The AOF/CC will update the 375 AMW/CC and 375 OG/CC.
9.8. Distinguished Visitor Notification Procedures.
   9.8.1. Pilots of base-assigned aircraft transporting O-6s (or equivalent) in the position of
   wing commander (or equivalent) or DV Code 6 or higher will contact the 375 AMW/CP on
   UHF 383.2 or VHF 130.65 at least 30 minutes prior to landing with DV status and an
   estimated block time.
   9.8.2. If unable to contact the 375 AMW/CP, contact AM on Pilot-to-Dispatch and provides
   DV status, block time and aircraft maintenance status. AM will pass this information to the
   375 AMW/CP.
   9.8.3. The ATCT will pass a “DV check” to AM when the DV aircraft is at 15 flying miles
   out and call AM with a “DV arrival” when the DV aircraft lands.
   9.8.4. The term “DV” will not be used over the airwaves. DV aircraft shall be replaced with
   “priority aircraft”.
9.9. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo. These procedures are in addition to those contained in AF
Joint Instruction 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials.
Taxi routes and other procedures applicable to hazardous material and contaminated aircraft are
established for use at SAFB. SAFB has extremely limited explosive storage and parking
locations. SAFB is unsuitable for hazardous cargo without prior coordination and should not be
considered a routine location for missions carrying hazardous cargo.

       9.29.1.3. Duration must be held to a minimum because of the impact to flying missions.
   9.29.2. Airfield restrictions may include no taxiing or engine runs on the Main Ramp, no
   local pattern air traffic West of RWY 14R/32L, and/or transitions, departures, or arrivals on
   RWY 14R/32L. The 375 OG/CC may direct more or less stringent restrictions as the
   situation warrants.
   9.29.3. The 375 AMW/CP must obtain 375 OG/CC’s approval for mission aircraft
   operations West of RWY 14R/32L during quiet hour periods. The 375 AMW/CP will notify
   AM and ATCT of approved operations.
   9.29.4. Normally, aircraft operations on the 126 ARW Ramp are not affected by airfield
   quiet hours. The 126 ARW engine runs during quiet hours require 126 ARW Logistics
   Group (LG) or 126 ARW/OG approval. The 126 ARW/CP will contact the 375 AMW/CP to
   inform them of the approval. The 375 AMW/CP will notify the 375 OG/CC and AM of the
   126 ARW approved engine run.
9.30. Airfield Coordination Requirements. Airfield activities (air shows, aerial
demonstrations, exercises, deployments, crane operations, construction projects, etc.) must be
coordinated through AM in advance to ensure proper notification and coordination.
9.31. Airfield Construction. Persons initiating work projects on or near the airfield must
coordinate the projects with AM before the start of construction. This policy includes
construction or repair activity in or around any part of the airfield environment, transitional
surface areas, runway safety areas or clear zones and aircraft parking ramps or aprons. Note:
Information about these areas may be obtained from the AFM.
   9.31.1. Coordination. The base civil engineers (375 CES) shall coordinate the location,
   dates, and times of construction and any restrictions to aircraft operations with AM.
       9.31.1.1. Crane operations present special problems around an airfield and must be
       coordinated through the (375 CES a minimum of 45 days in advance of the requested
       operation to ensure a FAA Form 7460-1, Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration,
       is filed as required by Title 14 CFR, Part 77. AM must be notified 5 days in advance of
       any crane operation to ensure flying operations are not impacted. Note: When the
       approved FAA Form 7460-1 is returned to the requester, a copy must be sent to the 375
       CES and the 375 OSS/OSAA. Failure to coordinate may result in suspension of crane
       operations until approved for flight safety.
       9.31.1.2. Temporary Construction Waivers. All proposed airfield construction must be
       coordinated 45 days in advance through the 375 CES. See (UFC) 3-260-01
       Airfield/Heliport Planning Design (UFC 3-260-01) for further instructions.          In
       accordance with (IAW) AFI 13-204V3, the AFM must have a copy of the approved
       waiver, signed by the 375 AMW/CC, prior to an airfield construction project starting.
       Submit request for waivers through the 375 CES 60 days prior to project start date.
   9.31.2. Airfield construction within restricted areas requires the initiating agency to provide
   the escort for contracted personnel. Note: AM does not provide escort for airfield
   construction projects.
   9.31.3. AM will ensure all contractors are briefed and trained on safe flight line driving
   procedures IAW SCOTTAFBI 13-213.
SCOTTAFBI13-204 30 JULY 2013                                                                  63


   9.31.4. AM will be invited to all airfield pre-construction, work in-progress, and project
   acceptance construction meetings.
   9.31.5. Activity. Construction activity on or adjacent to any aircraft movement area (RWYs,
   TWYs, ramps or parking aprons) must be well defined to contractors and users of the airfield
   by marked barricades. Barricades will be placed by CES or designated personnel in such a
   manner that inadvertent entry to the construction site by aircraft or vehicles is eliminated.
   The AFM will identify the location of barricades at pre-construction meetings and monitor
   their placement throughout the entire construction activity.
       9.31.5.1. Debris from construction sites on or near taxiways or ramps must be stockpiled
       no closer than one half the wingspan, plus 50’ from the TWY/ramp centerline of the
       largest aircraft that may use the adjacent area. Preferably all construction debris should
       be removed immediately from the site. Dirt piles may not be higher than three (3) feet
       and no closer than 200’ from any NAVAID without the 375 CS and the AM
       coordination.
       9.31.5.2. The AM must approve construction vehicle access and haul routes to and from
       construction sites on the airfield. Construction crews must stay within approved
       construction boundaries and approved entry and exit routes when entering or leaving the
       construction zones.
       9.31.5.3. Construction crews must clean aircraft movement pavement and surrounding
       safety areas to an acceptable condition before the area is opened for aircraft use. When
       construction is complete, the AFM, 375 AMW/SE, and 375 CES will inspect the surface
       and point out areas that need additional cleaning or repair. The area will be open to
       aircraft traffic only after all debris and barricades are removed and 375 CES, AM and 375
       AMW/SE accepts the site.
9.32. Military Exercises and FAA Certification Exercises. Exercises (natural disaster, major
accident, etc.) and FAA Certification Exercises involving the AOA must be coordinated with the
AFM, IAW the Joint SAFB/MAA Emergency Plan. IAW AFI 13-204V3, the AOF/CC must be
briefed of exercise scenarios involving the airfield at least 48 hours in advance. Officials from
the MAA will notify the AOF/CC of scheduled FAA Certification Exercises as soon as possible.
9.33. Unmanned Aircraft Systems/Remotely Piloted Aircraft. UAS/RPA operations are not
authorized at SAFB. There are no LOPs or LOAs allowing the use of UAS/RPA, or that
designate SAFB as an alternate landing location.
9.34. Airfield Paint and Rubber Removal Plan.
   9.34.1. The annual airfield paint plan is developed each Fall to determine the amount of
   funds expected for annual airfield painting, touch up painting, and if required per ETL 04-10
   (Determining the Need for Runway Rubber Removal), rubber removal as needed. Note:
   Approximately half of all airfield markings are repainted annually while rubber removal
   occurs on an average of about every 3 years.

  9.34.2. Funding for paint and rubber removal is programmed on an annual/as-needed basis
  and is given a priority for funding through AMC Installations and Mission Support (A7).
  Note: Approximately half of all airfield markings are repainted annually while rubber
  removal occurs on about an every 3-year average.
