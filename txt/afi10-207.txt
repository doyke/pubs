                                          Chapter 1

                                     ORGANIZATION

1.1. Command Post
1.1.1. Command Post (CP).The CP serves as one of the core functions of the Installation Control
Center (IC2) construct. The CP is a full-time, 24/7 C2 node, directly responsible to
commander(s) and serves as the focal point of operations, including the receipt and
dissemination of orders, information, and requests necessary for the C2 of assigned forces and
operations. This AFI is applicable to all CPs.

       1.1.1.1. Consolidated Command Post. A CP comprised of CP elements from two or
       more separate MAJCOMs/wings/units from the same component who merge together to
       share a common facility with each element responsive to the same CP managers. There
       is one set of CP managers, and below the managers, one chain of authority, direction, and
       control. Controllers are trained and certified to facilitate C2 for every mission aspect
       represented by the host and former tenant CP, to include all applicable supporting
       MAJCOM guidance. All individuals assigned to a Consolidated CP will attend
       supporting/supported MAJCOM’s required course(s) prior to certification (T-2). At
       Active Component (AC) installations, all Consolidated CP manpower authorizations will
       be owned by the MAJCOM operating the installation and 1C3 billets will be assigned to
       the host wing Program Element Code (PEC) (T-2).
          1.1.1.1.1. CPs supporting an AMS will have five of the merged AMC billets program
          element code (PEC) coded as AMC to ensure availability for future and emerging
          combatant command and AMC requirements (T-1). If emerging AMC mission
          requirements demand additional 1C3 support within the EUCOM or PACOM Area of
          Responsibility (AOR)s, the 515th or 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing (AMOW)
          Superintendent will notify the AMC 1C3 Functional Manager and theater (USAFE or
          PACAF) MAJCOM 1C3 Functional Manager (MFM) to temporarily deploy
          controllers to the location as directed by the applicable AMOW Commander (T-2).
          The tasked locations/members will be at the discretion of the respective theater MFM,
          based on manning levels at his/her specific units (T-2). NOTE: NAF/AFCHQ/FOAs
          are included in consolidation actions.
          1.1.1.1.2. All personnel working in a Consolidated CP must be thoroughly trained
          and certified on mission tasks performed prior to the consolidation (T-2). All mission
          tasks and responsibilities (e.g., operating instructions [OIs] and quick reaction
          checklists [QRC]), applicable MAJCOM guidance to include: Supplements, CCIRs,
          CIFs, CONOPs and MTPs will be incorporated into the Consolidated CP mission, and
          training program (T-2). CP managers will continue training on mission tasks using
          the Specialty Training Standard (STS), 1C3 Master Training Plan (MTP), AFI 36-
          2201, Air Force Training Program and Chapter 7 of this instruction (T-2).
          1.1.1.1.3. Consolidated CPs are referred to as (Base name) CP.
       1.1.1.2. CP Association. A CP comprised of CP elements from two or more separate
       wings/units from different components (AC or ARC) who share a common facility with
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                        7


     each element responsive to the same CP managers. Normally, the CP manager team is a
     mixture of the components involved. Administrative Control (ADCON) of controllers
     resides with the component they are a member of, i.e., ARC personnel work
     administratively for ARC. Controllers in a CP Association are trained on all mission
     tasks supported by the CP Association. This type of CP applies where the determination
     has been made that component-specific mission aspects can be mutually supported by the
     CP console crew. This type of CP is not applicable where CP elements from only one
     component are concerned; in that instance refer to Consolidated CP.
        1.1.1.2.1. All personnel working in a CP Association must be thoroughly trained and
        certified on mission tasks performed prior to combining (T-2). All mission tasks and
        responsibilities (e.g., OIs, QRCs, and duties and responsibilities) will be incorporated
        into the CP Association mission (T-3). CP managers ensure continued training on
        mission tasks using the STS, 1C3 MTP, AFI 36-2201, and Chapter 7 of this
        instruction (T-2).
        1.1.1.2.2. Use AFI 90-1001, Responsibilities for Total Force Integration, as guidance
        when preparing proposals to form CP Associations.
        1.1.1.2.3. CP Associations must be properly staffed according to approved
        memoranda of agreement/memoranda of understanding (MOA/MOU) that adhere to
        the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force (CSAF)-approved construct (T-1).
        Coordination among component and MAJCOM 1C3 Functional Manager (MFM) is
        vital to ensure each mission is supported without degradation.
        1.1.1.2.4. CP Associations are referred to as (Base name) CP.
     1.1.1.3. Collocated Command Post. A CP comprised of CP controllers from two or more
     separate wings/units from different components (AC or ARC) who share a common
     facility. Each CP element has its own CP managers, chain of command and C2
     responsibilities. Controllers in a Collocated CP may share information with one another,
     but do not share work, (e.g., controllers are not trained to perform one another’s
     component specific mission). Additionally, ADCON of CP controllers reside with the
     commander from each controller's component. This type of CP only applies to a CP
     whose elements are from different components, where organization of a CP Association,
     is deemed impractical. This type of CP is not applicable where only the CP elements
     from a single component are concerned.
        1.1.1.3.1. All personnel working in a Collocated CP must be thoroughly trained and
        certified on mission tasks performed (T-2). CP managers will ensure continued
        training on mission tasks using the STS, 1C3 MTP, AFI 36-2201, and Chapter 7 of
        this instruction (T-2).
     1.1.1.4. Regional Command Post. A CP that is fully integrated into one facility
     comprised of CP elements from two or more installations in the same geographical region
     may include CP elements from different components (AC or ARC). ADCON of ARC
     CP personnel reside with the ARC unit commander to which they are assigned. There is
     one set of CP managers and all CP controllers are capable of facilitating C2 for every
     mission aspect represented by all wings and tenant units supported. Once established,
 8                                                                    AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


        Regional CPs follow the same guidance as Consolidated CP/CP Association as outlined
        in this instruction.
            1.1.1.4.1. All personnel working in a Regional CP must be thoroughly trained and
            certified on mission tasks performed prior to the regionalizing (T-2). All mission
            tasks and responsibilities (e.g., OIs, QRCs, and duties and responsibilities) will be
            incorporated into the Regional CP mission (T-3). CP managers will ensure continued
            training on mission tasks using the STS, 1C3 MTP, AFI 36-2201, and Chapter 7 of
            this instruction (T-2).
            1.1.1.4.2. When creating a Regional CP composed of more than one component, all
            coordination requirements listed in AFI 90-1001 must be met, prior to
            implementation (T-1).
            1.1.1.4.3. Regional CP establishment is coordinated with the CP MFM(s), MAJCOM
            A3(s), and the AFCFM. Final approval authority is the AF Director of Air
            Operations.
            1.1.1.4.4. At installations, AC manpower authorizations at a Regional CP will be
            owned by the MAJCOM operating the installation (T-2). 1C3s billets will be under
            the host wing PEC (T-2).
            1.1.1.4.5. ARC manpower authorizations at a Regional CP will be owned by the
            ARC element they represent (T-2).
            1.1.1.4.6. Regional CPs are referred to as (Region) CP.
     1.1.2. Specialized C2 Element (SC2E). These are activities that perform operations in
     support of specialized mission requirements. The following are SC2Es: Air Mobility
     Control Center (AMCC); Crisis Response Group (CRG); Air Operations Center (AOC);
     Office of Special Investigations Operations Center; 1 HS MCC, MAJCOM Command
     Centers, AF Watch, USAFE MUNSS or MAJCOM-defined SC2Es. This AFI is applicable
     to SC2E where directly specified. MAJCOMs will determine additional applicability of this
     AFI in their respective MAJCOM supplements (T-1).
     1.1.3. MAJCOMs will provide the CFM a list of their Command's CP designations depicting
     which units have been merged and their title (i.e.: Consolidated CP, CP Association,
     Collocated CP, Regional CP). The CFM will maintain this list on the 1C3 Intelink.
     1.1.4. Each installation (base, station, joint-base, etc.) operating a CP will maintain and
     operate a single CP (where determined to be legal and beneficial) to support C2
     activities/functions for all resident and tenant units/organizations (T-2).
     1.1.5. AF organizations at the wing or group level residing on an installation operated by
     another service component (e.g., Joint Basing) may maintain and operate a stand-alone CP
     when the C2 needs of the AF organization cannot be met by the host service.
1.2. C2 Direction
     1.2.1. The CSAF exercises C2 of AF forces through a global structure of fixed and
     expeditionary C2 facilities. The AF Service Watch Cell (AF WATCH) provides positive and
     effective C2 of AF assets in support of the AF mission. The AF WATCH communicates
     CSAF direction directly to MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Units.
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                       9


   1.2.2. MAJCOM command centers direct/exercise C2 of MAJCOM resources. Within the
   MAJCOM C2 structure, the MAJCOM command center is authorized to communicate
   command (CJCS, Combatant Command [COCOM], USAF, or MAJCOM) directions to
   operational organizations. However, there will be instances where CJCS or COCOM
   direction is communicated directly to the AFCHQ AOC or executing/supporting forces (e.g.,
   Operational Plan [OPLAN] 8010 directives). MAJCOM command centers originate
   command directions, oversee status and location of MAJCOM resources, and manage
   commander-directed reporting or Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIR).
   1.2.3. The installation CP is the primary agency authorized to communicate command
   (CJCS, COCOM, USAF, or MAJCOM) directions to operational organizations supporting
   the entire installation (e.g., security forces, base operations) (T-1). The CP is the only
   installation C2 function authorized to receive and process Emergency Action Messages
   (EAM) and prepare and transmit AF operational reports (AF OPREP-3) (T-1). Installation
   CPs provide C2 support to tenant units, to include relaying command directions, flight
   following, and operational reporting. Tenant units must coordinate and communicate
   operational requirements involving host resources through the CP (T-3). Resulting MOAs
   are developed IAW AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support
   Agreement Procedures, and maintained on file.
1.3. Organization.
   1.3.1. The MAJCOM command center is the focal point of the MAJCOMs’ operations and
   conducts activities according to MAJCOM plans and policies. MAJCOM command centers
   are organized as a staff agency under the MAJCOM commander, typically administratively
   aligned under the Director of Staff (DS) or Director of Operations (A3).
   1.3.2. The installation CP is the focal point of an installation’s operations and conducts
   activities according to assigned units’ plans and policies.
      1.3.2.1. The installation CP serves as the executive agency for C2 for commanders
      during routine operations, emergencies, contingencies, and increased readiness. The CP
      is a direct representative of the commander and serves as the sole agency responsible for
      executing CP-related C2 activities.
      1.3.2.2. The installation CP is a wing staff office organized directly under the wing
      organizational structure. CP managers are tasked with the responsibility of operating the
      CP on behalf of the wing commander. As such, either the wing commander, vice wing
      commander, or director of staff will be the reporting official for the CP Chief or
      Superintendent (T-2).
      1.3.2.3. At joint bases where the AF is the supporting component, the CP remains the
      responsibility of the Operational (Mission) Wing Commander (T-1).
1.4. CP Functional Areas
   1.4.1. As a minimum, CPs consist of the following functional areas: Command Post
   Operations (includes Emergency Actions (EA) processing capability [if applicable]),
   Reports, Training, and Systems. These functional areas perform duties in support of the
   career field’s four core competencies: Mission monitoring/management, EA, emergency
   management, and operational reporting (includes readiness reporting: Defense Readiness
 10                                                                 AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


   Reporting System [DRRS], Mission Essential Task/List [METL]Assessments, Status of
   Resource and Training Systems [SORTS]/Category-Level [C-Level]).
1.5. Provisions
   1.5.1. Installation Notification and Warning Systems (INWS) should only be used to make
   emergency notifications and should not be relegated to a daily pop-up notification, which
   would de-emphasize the emergency notification process.
   1.5.2. At the commander’s discretion, CPs may review high-priority messages addressed to
   the installation commander/vice commander, and tenant wing commander(s)/vice
   commander(s) during non-duty hour periods, to determine whether the message warrants
   immediate delivery/action. CPs will not be tasked to review/route routine or non-emergency
   base-wide/MAJCOM headquarters message traffic (T-3).
   1.5.3. 1C3X1 controllers receive Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) at the standard
   rate, due to the nature of assigned duties (e.g., inability to depart the work center, non-
   standard duty hours) IAW AFMAN 65-116V1, Defense Joint Military Pay System Active
   Component (DJMS-AC) FSO Procedures (T-1). 1C3X1s will be placed in dorm rooms that
   have cooking facilities to enable them to process meals for rotating shift work schedules (T-
   3).

          3.1.1.1.3. SC2Es may be manned with a minimum of one certified controller, unless
          otherwise directed by MAJCOM/COCOM guidance.
       3.1.1.2. Reduced Manning. When manning is insufficient to support two controllers per
       shift, CP Managers may request waivers to operate the CP with reduced manning.
       Waiver requests will include a copy of their last three and next three draft duty schedules
       and current manning reports (T-2). For locations where CP leaders' certification has been
       waived, CP leaders must develop a plan to certify and include a timeline outlining their
       projected certification (T-2). An approved waiver is required prior to commencing single
       controller operations (T-2). ANG 1C3 CFM and AFRC 1C3 MFM will be the waiver

  3.1.3. (Not applicable to AFRC) Personnel cross training into the 1C3 AFSC are required
  to be interviewed by a CP Superintendent and a Competent Medical Authority (CMA) for the
  personnel reliability program (PRP) eligibility prior to being approved for cross-training (T-
  1). The superintendent will review the member’s current Assignment Management System
  (AMS) Single Unit Retrieval Format (SURF), last five EPRs, individual assessment history
  print out, and conduct a face-to-face interview (T-2). If any potential negative trends or
  issues which would impact the member receiving a top secret security clearance, they should
  non-recommend the individual for cross training. The CMA reviews the member’s records
  for potential disqualifying information (PDI) that would result in permanent PRP
  disqualification. If PDI that would result in permanent PRP disqualification is discovered,
  the CMA does not recommend the member to cross train into the 1C3 career field.
     3.1.3.1. The interview process is critical to maintaining the integrity of the 1C3 AFSC.
     CP missions differ based on command of assignment and weapon systems employed.
     Therefore, the interviewer considers the person’s ability to meet all AFSC requirements
     when deciding whether to recommend a person for retraining into the 1C3X1 AFSC.
     Minimum requirements for a retraining interview are listed in Attachment 2.
     3.1.3.2. If the applicant does not have access to a CP (e.g., deployed/assigned location
     has no CP), individuals are interviewed and recommended for entry into the 1C3X1
     AFSC by their MAJCOM 1C3 Functional Manager (telephone interviews are
     acceptable).
     3.1.3.3. All recommendations to allow the member to cross train into the 1C3 AFSC are
     reviewed and approved by the AFCFM; all documentation is to be sent with the
     recommendation.
  3.1.4. CP Chief. When CMS 135A00 authorizes a CP Chief, the CP Chief should be
  assigned/possess the 86P SDI or 13N AFSC; however, other AFSCs are acceptable upon

         completed their CCAF and SNCO PME, have demonstrated their unwillingness to
         properly lead by failing to complete the AFI 36-2618 SNCO requirements; the CP
         Chief or Wing Commander are encouraged to consider replacing them with a MSgt/7-
         level who has demonstrated the knowledge and leadership qualities to be the CP
         Superintendent. NOTE: For Consolidated CPs/CP Associations/Regional CPs,
         MAJCOMs determine component leadership, which is documented via MOA/MOU

personnel who reside in the dormitory are not exempt from performing bay orderly functions in
the dorm common areas.
   3.4.1. The duty schedule is approved by the CP Superintendent or designated alternate. CP
   managers will post duty schedules no later than (NLT) 20th of each month (T-3).
   3.4.2. Each CP is different with regard to creating a work schedule. Controllers will not
   perform more than 12 hours of continuous duty (plus necessary time for shift changeover)
   (T-3). Each controller will be provided eight hours of uninterrupted rest before shift or any
   scheduled CP meetings (T-1). EXCEPTION: In times of emergency, controllers may be
   required to perform duty in excess of 12 hours to ensure uninterrupted C2. Recommended
   work schedules for home station consoles is a panama combination with the same shift for
   two weeks or the same shift for the entire month, which helps controllers maintain circadian
   rhythm. The standard work schedule for deployed operations is 12-hour shifts, 6 days on
   duty, 1 day off or panama combination.
   3.4.3. Controllers will not consume alcohol within eight hours preceding a scheduled
   console shift (T-1).
   3.4.4. Controllers should coordinate leave requests and appointments with the duty scheduler
   NLT the 15th day of the preceding month of a published duty schedule. Controllers should
   plan for bay orderly duties, dental and medical appointments, WAPS testing, training
   requirements, and leave projections and make every effort to de-conflict with the schedule.
 24                                                                 AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


   Not notifying leadership of schedule deviation(s) can cause conflicts and may potentially
   cripple mission accomplishment.
   3.4.5. Managers should designate a minimum of one individual to attend mandatory
   formations (e.g., Commander’s Call). The designated individual attending the mandatory
   formation will brief all CP personnel on items of interest during the next training meeting
   and/or establish a CIF item for information requiring immediate dissemination. CP overhead
   personnel will attend mandatory formations, unless performing console duties or otherwise
   excused by CP managers (T-3).
   3.4.6. To aid analysis of work distribution, duty schedules (to include changes) will be
   retained IAW AFI 33-322, Records Management Program (T-2).
   3.4.7. Shift Requirements. All certified controllers are required to perform at least two full
   shifts per calendar month, verified through events log review (T-2). Individuals not meeting
   this requirement will be decertified and must complete recertification training and be
   recertified, IAW Chapter 7 (T-2). ARC Traditional CP managers and controllers must
   perform 4 hours of console currency a month or 8 hours in 60 days to maintain certification,
   verified by events log entry (T-3). NOTE: Certified controllers can take up to 59 days of
   consecutive leave or TDY without being decertified for not working two full shifts per
   month.
3.5. Unit Manning
   3.5.1. UMD General Information. Manpower management is an essential part of resource
   management and key to mission accomplishment. It is critical that CP managers understand
   the basics of identifying and managing manpower to meet the mission.
      3.5.1.1. The UMD is a computer-generated product extracted from the Manpower
      Programming and Execution System (MPES) and is a key product used in the
      management of manpower resources at all organizational levels. It lists the number and
      type of manpower (enlisted, officer, or civilian); authorized and required grades, and
      AFSC required by personnel accounting symbol (PAS); Functional Account Code (FAC);
      Office Symbol Code (OSC); and whether the positions are funded or unfunded
      requirements.
      3.5.1.2. Additional data codes are also used to further define positions and organizational
      structure, such as duty titles, supervisory positions, organizational structure titles,
      authorization effective dates, and PEC. The UMD does not reflect information about the
      individuals who are filling the authorized positions; the UPMR, generated by the
      personnel community, provides specific data associated with assigned personnel.
      3.5.1.3. CP managers will request a UMD from the installation Manpower Office (MO)
      quarterly (T-3). It is imperative managers review their UMD to ensure it accurately
      reflects unit requirements. UMD changes or discrepancies are reported to the unit
      manpower POC and MFM (T-3).
   3.5.2. UPMR. CP managers gather information on other full-time/part-time borrowed or
   loaned personnel and update this information monthly through the commander’s support staff
   (CSS), or equivalent. The UPMR reflects personnel and the UMD reflects the positions; it is
   critical to ensure personnel are assigned to the correct grade and position on the CP UMD.
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                       25


  An imbalance between the UMD and UPMR can have a negative impact on the mission and
  the unit’s ability to meet AEF taskings. CP managers will request an UPMR quarterly, and
  report discrepancies to the CSS and MFM immediately (T-3).
  3.5.3. Preparing the CP Manning Report. The CP manning report provides CP functional
  managers with current and projected manning status based on the UMD and UPMR. It is a
  valuable tool in determining future manning and tasking priorities. MAJCOMs may add to
  the content of the manning report; however, as a minimum, the manning report contains the
  information stipulated in para 3.5.4. CP manning reports will meet the requirements of all
  parent MAJCOMs/functional managers (e.g., MFMs and ANG Functional Manager) (T-2).
  CP managers will (T-2):
     3.5.3.1. Ensure the UMD accurately reflects authorizations.
     3.5.3.2. Maintain an updated current (quarterly) copy of the UMD and UPMR.
     3.5.3.3. Verify accuracy of duty AFSC and position number on personnel actions.
     3.5.3.4. Maintain a suspense file of personnel actions and verify approved actions are
     correctly entered into the Personal Data System (PDS).
     3.5.3.5. Coordinate permanent change of assignment (PCA) actions. Ensure required
     documentation is completed and submitted.
     3.5.3.6. Allocate projected gains against forecasted or actual vacant authorizations.
  3.5.4. CP Manning Report Submission Instructions. The manning report will be submitted
  monthly to MFMs (AD FOAs/DRUs will submit reports to 1C3 DRU/FOA Functional
  Manager) (T-2). When significant changes occur that require HHQ involvement, CP
  managers will notify the MFM/AFCFM (as applicable) as soon as possible (T-2).
  MAJCOMs will develop guidance or instruction for submitting manning reports; however,
  they need to contain the following:
     3.5.4.1. Position. The 7-digit position number (PN) from the UMD.
     3.5.4.2. Authorized Rank. Rank authorized for PN.
     3.5.4.3. Authorized AFSC. AFSC authorized for PN.
     3.5.4.4. Assigned Rank. Rank of person currently assigned to PN. If the person has
     been selected for promotion, include the letter P immediately after the current rank.
     3.5.4.5. Name. The full name and middle initial of person assigned to PN. If more than
     one person is assigned to a single PN, ensure this is properly reflected. Include projected
     gains and annotate month/year gained in remarks. Designate senior controller status next
     to name (e.g., Jones, James A. -SR).
     3.5.4.6. Date Arrived Station (DAS). The date individual arrived on station. Use month
     and year (e.g., Feb 07).
     3.5.4.7. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Projection. The date member is scheduled
     to perform a PCS move. Use month and year (e.g., Feb 07).
     3.5.4.8. Deployment Status. This block reflects the last date an individual deployed to
     support a contingency tasking. Use month and year (e.g., Feb 07). Annotate “none” if an
26                                                                  AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


     individual has not previously deployed. Use “non-deployable” if an individual cannot
     deploy. NOTE: Do not state the reason a member cannot deploy as this may violate The
     Privacy Act of 1974 or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
     Finally, include the AEF Tempo Band the member is assigned to.
     3.5.4.9. Remarks. Mandatory remarks, if applicable, are listed below. Other remarks
     may be added as necessary (i.e., if individual is decertified, has PRP or security clearance
     issues, or anything else affecting CP manning). Remarks:
        3.5.4.9.1. Identify CP Chief, Superintendent, NCOIC CP Operations, NCOIC CP
        Training, NCOIC Systems, and NCOIC Reports.

        date.
        3.5.4.9.3. TDY status for TDYs 15 or more days in duration, to include estimated
        time of return (ETR) or projected departure date (PDD). For example: TDY JEFX
        07-1, ETR 15 Jun 06, or Tasked for D 1, PDD Aug 14.
        3.5.4.9.4. CPs supporting OPLAN 8010 taskings or U.S. Air Forces Europe
        (USAFE) Nonstrategic Nuclear Forces (NSNF) must aggressively track award of the
        Nuclear C2 SEI. CP managers will denote CP controllers not yet awarded the
        Nuclear C2 SEI and state the reason and estimated date of award (EDA). For
        example: Has attended the Joint Nuclear C2 (JNC2) Course and is formally certified,
        but does not have 12 months experience/EDA Feb 07.
        3.5.4.9.5. Security clearance using one of the following entries: NONE; ―IS for
        interim Secret; ―S for Secret; ―ITS for interim Top Secret; ―TS for Top Secret; or

           CONSOLE OPERATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES

5.1. Publications Library. The CP will maintain all publications required for CP operations,
training, and execution of unit contingency and home station plans (T-3). Publications may be
maintained electronically, as long as backup copies are available to ensure document
survivability during equipment/network outages/catastrophic failures.
5.2. OIs
   5.2.1. OIs will be developed when the situation cannot be completely covered by QRCs or as
   mission changes dictate (e.g., new requirements, consolidating/combining CP) (T-3). OIs
   must contain complete information to accomplish the specific task involved and reference all
   applicable publications and background materials (e.g., policy directives, instructions,
   operator’s manuals) (T-3). OIs must be reviewed by CP managers prior to publication, when
   changed, and semiannually after publication (T-3). The review will be documented on the
   AF Form 4436 and maintained in all OI binders (T-3).
   5.2.2. CP OIs relating to Nuclear Surety will be reviewed by Unit Weapons Safety
   semiannually or as changes occur and documented on the AF Form 4436 (T-2).
   5.2.3. CPs will maintain current applicable OIs (T-3). OIs are prepared and numbered IAW
   AFI 33-360. OIs may be combined, at the discretion of CP managers, as long as the topics
   are adequately addressed (e.g., equipment operation and communications systems listing,
   outages, and reporting). The minimum required OIs are (T-3):
       5.2.3.1. CP Operations (Leave, Schedule, Events Logs, ACP activation, Equipment
       Operations, and Airfield Operations).
       5.2.3.2. Other OIs are optional as mission or leadership dictates (e.g., Training, Reports,
       Hazardous Cargo, Security, Mobility)
       5.2.3.3. CP Entry Control and Circulation OI is required, unless a CBC is developed
       and/or used.
5.3. Checklists. Checklist use is mandatory (T-1). Checklists outline actions to be taken in
response to emergencies, abnormal or recurring circumstances, to implement LERTCON actions
(e.g., EAMs), or to implement operational order (OPORD) or OPLAN requirements. They are
brief, concise, and lead controllers through an orderly and prioritized sequence from initiation to
completion. CP managers must review checklists semiannually or immediately after a
procedural change is made to the checklist (T-3). Semiannual reviews will be documented on
AF Form 4436 and maintained in all checklists (EAC, CBC, QRC) binders (T-3). Checklist
containing classified information/formats will be marked and maintained IAW AFI 31-401 (T-0).

     clearly identifiable as real world or exercise (T-3)
  5.3.3. CBCs. CBCs address routine recurring subjects that are not time-sensitive in nature,
  including, but not limited to, shift checklists and changeover checklists. A minimum of one
  set of CBCs is required (T-3). CBCs will not be intermingled with QRCs (T-3). They may
  be placed in the same binder with the QRCs, but should be maintained in a separate section.
  CBCs will include (T-3):
     5.3.3.1. Shift Changeover Checklists. Shift changeover checklists are developed and
     maintained to ensure oncoming CP controllers complete all required actions prior to
     assuming duty, including, as a minimum, the following items (as applicable) (T-3):
         5.3.3.1.1. Review and ensure all CIF items are initialed
         5.3.3.1.2. Events logs. Review current-day and previous logs since controller’s last
         shift.
         5.3.3.1.3. AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log. Review visitor register log to ensure
         visitor accountability, and account for all visitor badges.
         5.3.3.1.4. Review incoming and outgoing messages
         5.3.3.1.5. COMSEC material inventory.        Physically identify, inventory, and
         document equipment and systems, as required.
     5.3.3.2. Controller Shift Checklists. Upon shift checklist completion, log results in the
     CP daily events log to show all items complete. If not all items were completed, include
     a reason the step was not completed along with log entry. As a minimum, controller shift
     checklists will include (T-3):
         5.3.3.2.1. Secure voice equipment tests. Accomplish communication checks with
         another unit after each change of keying material or at least weekly for each secure
         voice telephone system (e.g., NATO Secure Voice, voice over secure IP [VOSIP],
         Defense Switched Red Network [DSRN], and Secure Terminal Equipment [STE])
         installed in the CP console area. Report any discrepancies to the appropriate agency
         and document work order/trouble ticket information on change over brief and daily
         events log.

     5.3.3.3. End of month COMSEC checklist. The end of month COMSEC checklist is
     developed and maintained to ensure all required COMSEC actions are completed each
     month.
  5.3.4. QRCs. QRCs are structured to save lives, protect resources, and rapidly disseminate
  time sensitive information. QRCs are brief, concise, and lead controllers through an orderly
  and prioritized sequence of actions. QRC automated notifications and conferences are
  authorized and encouraged (e.g., telephone alerting systems, network-centric emergency
  notification systems, INWS).
     5.3.4.1. QRCs are organized in a manner that allows controllers to instantaneously select
     the appropriate QRC. A minimum of three complete, identical sets of QRCs will be
     maintained, one at each controller position and one for the ACP (T-3). An electronic
     copy of the QRCs will be maintained external to the CP, in the event of a catastrophic
     event that prevents proper evacuation of the primary facility (T-3). MAJCOMs may
     authorize the use of electronic QRCs; however, one paper copy set must be maintained in
     the event of a complete power failure/inability to access electronic media. (T-2).
     5.3.4.2. The QRC binder will be conspicuously labeled to identify the contents as QRCs
     (T-3). QRC binders are divided into seven series; MAJCOMs/units are authorized to add
     additional series as needed. The QRC binders will include the following, as a minimum

     5.3.4.3. QRC construction. Use the following guidelines when constructing QRCs (T-3
     unless otherwise specified):
         5.3.4.3.1. Prioritize all checklist steps. Agencies and individuals listed to be
         contacted should be prioritized based on the initial data collected.
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                        33


          5.3.4.3.2. Only emergency-response notifications (e.g., ambulance, fire department,
          security forces) will be made prior to considering/initiating required AF OPREP-3
          actions (T-2).
          5.3.4.3.3. Telephone notifications will be limited to essential agencies/personnel
          only. Include appropriate primary and alternate agency contacts, during duty and
          non-duty hours, when practical. The maximum number of initial notifications per
          checklist will not exceed ten per controller.
          5.3.4.3.4. QRCs will include a step indicating CP daily events log entries are
          required; this step usually occurs at the second to the last step of QRC.
          5.3.4.3.5. QRC steps will refer controllers to Reports Guidebook and/or AFI 10-206,
          when applicable.
          5.3.4.3.6. QRC design should include the following considerations:
              5.3.4.3.6.1. Warnings. Critical information found in checklists that, if not
              followed, could result in mission failure, serious injury, or death.
              5.3.4.3.6.2. Cautions. Serious information that, if not followed, could result in
              mission degradation or equipment damage.
              5.3.4.3.6.3. Notes. Important checklist information that helps explain procedures
              or provide additional information.
              5.3.4.3.6.4. Lead-ins. Statements found in checklists that direct which steps
              should be accomplished in a particular situation; they can also direct the use of a
              different checklist. Lead-ins are usually presented in an “if, then” format and are
              always underlined.
              5.3.4.3.6.5. QRC references. List the specific reference(s) used to develop the
              checklist in the reference block at the bottom of the QRC; using "Local
              Procedures" is only permitted in the event of no other governing document
              requiring the checklist. Using "N/A" for a reference is not an option.
              5.3.4.3.6.6. List the date of checklist development or latest change in the date
              block.
   5.3.5. QRC subjects listed in Attachment 3 are not all-inclusive. CP managers develop and
   maintain QRCs based on their unit mission and/or probability of occurrence.
   5.3.6. Nuclear Surety QRC Review. QRCs relating to Nuclear Surety will be reviewed by
   unit weapons safety personnel semiannually or when changes occur (T-3). Safety reviews
   are documented on the AF Form 4436.
   5.3.7. QRC Changes. CP managers approve all new checklists, as well as significant
   revisions to existing ones. The NCOICs of CP Operations and CP Training will ensure all
   controllers are trained on new procedures and significant changes to existing procedures prior
   to checklists being posted (T-3). CP managers will advise controllers of significant checklist
   changes via CIF (T-3).
5.4. CP Daily Events Log. The purpose of the CP daily events log is to serve as an official
continuous record of events affecting the unit or functions of the CP. Because CPs must be able
 34                                                                  AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


to reconstruct the events, which occur on any given day, events logs will be completed for each
24-hour period (T-3).
   5.4.1. All CPs will maintain a CP daily events log using the AF Form 4377, Events Log, or
   other media prescribed by the owning MAJCOM (T-3). CPs are authorized to use a
   computer-generated (CG) AF Form 4377, as long as all fields are replicated and the bottom
   left of the form clearly states CG AF FORM 4377. CP daily events log will be opened at
   0001Z and closed at 2359Z (T-3).
   5.4.2. Classifying CP daily events logs. Unclassified CP daily events logs will be marked
   UNCLASSIFIED//For Official Use Only; classified logs will be marked according to content
   (T-0).
   5.4.3. Entries to the CP daily events log will be made in chronological sequence using Zulu
   time (T-3).
   5.4.4. Events logs for exercises will be maintained separate from real world CP daily events
   logs and clearly marked as EXERCISE at the top and bottom (T-3).
   5.4.5. As a minimum, the CP daily events log will document the following (T-3):
       5.4.5.1. All controllers on duty
       5.4.5.2. Shift checklist/changeover completion
       5.4.5.3. Significant events and notifications. Entries will include the checklist used and
       actions taken.
       5.4.5.4. Receipt of EAMs (include, as a minimum, originator and date-time-group
       [DTG])
       5.4.5.5. Changes to unit posture/preparedness
       5.4.5.6. Any event that requires initiation of a QRC
   5.4.6. Events logs are to be maintained as an official record IAW AFI 33-322 (T-2).
5.5. CIF Binder. The CIF binder is used to keep CP personnel informed of operational
information, such as HHQ policy/guidance, commander’s policy letters, leave and duty
schedules, training requirements, events, etc. The CIF should be maintained in the immediate
console area or electronically on a shared drive.
   5.5.1. The CIF binder will contain three distinct sections, one for each type of CIF item (T-
   2). Types of CIF items include:
       5.5.1.1. Temporary CIF Items. CIF items that are temporary in nature and support
       procedures that are expected to pass or be integrated permanently into checklists, OIs, AF
       Component/MAJCOM instructions, or moved to Permanent CIF items. Temporary CIF
       items should be integrated, moved, or rescinded within 90 days of issue.
       5.5.1.2. Permanent CIF Items. CIF items that support procedures that are permanent in
       nature and do not fit into checklists, OIs, or AF Component/MAJCOM instructions.
       These items either originated as permanent items or have been moved from Temporary
       CIF Items. Permanent CIF items are maintained until no longer needed.
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                          35


     5.5.1.3. C2CIF Items. CIF items are produced by AF and/or MAJCOM P&P that
     support procedural changes impacting the AF/MAJCOM CPs. C2CIF items are retained
     until rescinded or superseded by the issuing level.
  5.5.2. AF/AF Component/MAJCOM C2CIF Program. The C2CIF program ensures
  important information on CP operations is disseminated in a rapid and formalized manner.
  C2CIFs address a variety of issues such as test programs, interim policies and procedures,
  Readiness Reporting, operational reporting, etc.
     5.5.2.1. C2CIF Release Authority. AF/AF Component/MAJCOM CP P&P.
     5.5.2.2. C2CIF Numbering. AF/AF Component/MAJCOM CP P&P offices maintain a
     master list of C2CIF items released and controls their respective C2CIF program. AF
     items are identified by the designator: AF, calendar year (CY), and sequence number.
     As an example, the first AF originated C2CIF item for CY 2014 is designated “AF 14-
     001”, the second “AF 14-002”, etc. MAJCOM C2CIFs are identified by the appropriate
     MAJCOM acronym, CY, and sequence number. As an example, the first Air Force
     Space Command (AFSPC) C2CIF item for CY 2014 is designated “AFSPC 14-001”, the
     second “AFSPC 14-002”, etc.
     5.5.2.3. C2CIF Log. A listing of each active C2CIF issued is identified on a C2CIF log.
     The C2CIF log contains an assigned C2CIF designator, subject/title, rescind date, and
     “Applies to AFI” column.
  5.5.3. Unit CIF Program. The CP managers, NCOIC CP Operations, and NCOIC CP
  Training are authorized to post Unit CIF items. Items posted by the NCOICs of CP
  Operations or CP Training will be coordinated with CP managers prior to being posted (T-3).
     5.5.3.1. Unit CIF Numbering. Unit CIF items are designated by CY and sequence
     number. As an example, the first Unit CIF item for CY 2014 is designated “14-001”, the
     second “14-002”, etc.
     5.5.3.2. Unit CIF Logs. Develop a listing of each active CIF assigned to each CIF
     category. The log needs to contain an assigned CIF designator, title, date and person
     making entry, date and person removing, and remarks (T-3).
     5.5.3.3. CIF Disposition. CP managers should ensure old material is removed and
     filed/destroyed as appropriate, and that controllers are initialing CIF items IAW 5.5.4.2.
     Items of continuing value will be incorporated into directives, OIs, or filed in the file plan
     (T-3).
  5.5.4. Personnel Actions/Responsibilities:
     5.5.4.1. On-coming controllers will read and initial all new CIFs prior to assuming shift
     (T-2). All day staff personnel will read and initial all new items at least once a week, or
     prior to assuming shift, whichever occurs first (T-2).
     5.5.4.2. Upon reading a CIF, controllers place their initials on the corresponding line on
     the CIF log. Initialing the CIF log is an official statement by the controller that the CIF
     has been read and understood (T-2).
     5.5.4.3. Upon receipt of a C2CIF message, on-duty controllers will (T-2):
         5.5.4.3.1. Log message receipt in the CP daily events log
 36                                                                    AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


           5.5.4.3.2. Take appropriate action as directed by the C2CIF message
           5.5.4.3.3. File the message sequentially in the appropriate section of the CIF binder
5.6. Changeover Briefing. CPs will develop a (classified, on SIPR if required) briefing
controllers receive prior to assuming shift or sitting in, include as a minimum the following items
(T-3):
   5.6.1. EAM/FPCON/LERTCON/INFOCON Status. Address the current alert status, review
   of applicable EAMs, and the status of any open EACs.
   5.6.2. Airfield Status. For units with an operational airfield, address the status of runways,
   taxiways, lighting, Navigational Aids (NAVAID), and aircraft communications.
   5.6.3. Weather Conditions. Cover current and forecasted weather, to include weather
   watches, weather warnings, and other weather conditions that may impact unit mission
   accomplishment.
   5.6.4. Local, off-station and transient aircraft. Cover the location and status of unit aircraft
   that are on station, off station and any transient aircraft currently on station, or projected to
   arrive.

                                           Chapter 6

                        MISSION MANAGEMENT/MONITORING

6.1. Mission Movement. Execution of the mission is accomplished by controllers performing
pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight coordination, direction, and reporting necessary to ensure
successful mission accomplishment for all tasked missions. Specific controller mission
management/monitoring duties are based off Mobility Air Forces (MAF) or Combat Air Forces
(CAF) specific mission sets and unit requirements to support those mission sets. Information in
this chapter will not apply to all controllers at every location. MAF Controllers and those
supporting MAF transit operations (regardless of command), select Special Operations Forces
(SOF), and controllers at Consolidated CP locations supporting Air Mobility Squadron (AMS)
operations will adhere to mission execution procedures in AMCI 10-202 Vol 6, to include all
required forms and C2 systems (i.e.: GDSS, mission cards, etc) (T-2). MAF Controllers
supporting AMS operations will also follow guidance outlined in applicable AMC Instructions to
include, but not limited to: AMCI 10-202 V1 & V6, AMCI 11-206, AMCI 11-208) (T-2).
   6.1.1. Mission management is the function of organizing, planning, directing, and
   controlling CAF, MAF, SOF, and training missions operating worldwide. Mission
   management includes mission execution authority, i.e., the authority to direct where and
   when a mission goes and what it does once it arrives. This function is typically performed at
   the AOC level. An example of mission management functions are those performed by the
   618 AOC (TACC).
       6.1.1.1. Overall C2 mission management of MAF is provided by the NAF AOC that
       tasked the mission (e.g., 618 AOC will mission manage 18 AF-tasked missions and the
       613 AOC will mission manage 13 AF-tasked missions).
           6.1.1.1.1. 18 AF, through the 618 Air Operations Center (AOC) (TACC), will retain
           control of all AMC missions/operations at Consolidated CPs and will exercise that
           authority through the air mobility support controller(s) (T-2). Additionally, the AMS
           Commander at Consolidated CP locations will have authority to direct TACON over
           the AMC mission through the dedicated AMC controller(s) position (T-2).
   6.1.2. Mission monitoring is the function of organizing, planning, directing (limited), and
   controlling missions operating from or through a location. Mission monitoring does not
   include mission execution.
   6.1.3. General responsibilities for mission execution. C2 agencies such as the CP, MOC,
   ATOC, Airfield Management (AM Ops), etc., manage activities surrounding the execution of
   the mission and reporting the status of those activities.
   6.1.4. CP controllers maintain complete situational awareness concerning status and location
   of unit and transient aircraft. Controller situation awareness is instrumental to the prevention
   of and rapid response to instances of aircraft piracy (i.e., hijacking).
       6.1.4.1. Ensure procedures are developed to notify the NMCC of suspected or confirmed
       aircraft piracy (T-2).
       6.1.4.2. Controllers are highly encouraged to review the Crisis Management Guideline
       located in AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Attach 3).
 38                                                                   AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


6.2. Aircrew/Mission Support. The aircrew and CP interface is accomplished to provide an
exchange of required mission information.
   6.2.1. CPs provide information to support aircrew needs, as necessary, such as:
      6.2.1.1. Aircraft tail number and call sign
      6.2.1.2. Aircraft maintenance status
      6.2.1.3. Aircraft parking spot
      6.2.1.4. Departure time, route, and mission number
      6.2.1.5. Fuel load
      6.2.1.6. Cargo/passenger load
      6.2.1.7. Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP)
      6.2.1.8. Unique mission requirements
      6.2.1.9. DV information
      6.2.1.10. Deadhead crew, additional crewmember (ACM), etc., information
      6.2.1.11. Itinerary to next crew rest point
      6.2.1.12. Diplomatic clearance information
      6.2.1.13. 24-hour access to an aircrew intelligence read file
      6.2.1.14. Air refueling (A/R) information (e.g., receiver/tanker, mission status, A/R track
      weather, unique A/R radio frequencies)
      6.2.1.15. GDSS Airfield Database (AFD) printout
      6.2.1.16. Latest copy of North Atlantic Track (NAT) message
   6.2.2. Coordinate with the Flight Manager, when local events will impact a flight managed
   mission (T-2). Conversely, the Flight Manager will coordinate changes to flight managed
   missions with the CP (T-2).
   6.2.3. When requested by the aircraft commander, the CP should have the ability to provide
   or arrange for additional information or briefings related to such matters as, but not limited
   to:
      6.2.3.1. Hazardous cargo
      6.2.3.2. Electronic warfare activities
   6.2.4. For all en-route arrivals, the aircraft commander and ACMs will contact the
   appropriate CP and provide or receive the following information, as applicable (T-2):
      6.2.4.1. Stage posture
      6.2.4.2. Legal for alert time/alert window
      6.2.4.3. Crew/ACM orders
      6.2.4.4. Base information handout
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                          39


6.3. Originating Mission Setups.
   6.3.1. When supporting MAF missions/aircraft, controllers will ensure the below agencies
   have entered their information into GDSS not less than 6 hours prior to scheduled mission
   departure time (T-3):
      6.3.1.1. Current operations: Mission identifier and schedule.
      6.3.1.2. Applicable flying squadron: AC name and last four digits of social security
      number, squadron, wing, scheduled return time (SRT), call sign, and the breakdown of
      the aircrew (numbers of officers male and female and enlisted male and female).
      6.3.1.3. Maintenance group: Aircraft tail number, aircraft due home date (DHD), and
      parking.
6.4. Special Category Missions. Occasionally, CP controllers manage missions that are
operated with requirements and procedures different from standard missions. These special
category missions may place additional demands on the C2 system, above those required for
normal operations.
   6.4.1. CLOSE WATCH. CLOSE WATCH procedures expedite the flow of essential
   mission information up channeled to the agency imposing the procedure and ensure
   designated missions receive special attention. As applicable, CPs adhere to the following
   procedures for CLOSE WATCH missions (T-2):
      6.4.1.1. Mission movement forms, including computer equipment screen faces (e.g.,
      Theater Battle Management Core Systems [TBMCS], GDSS) used by the CP, are
      prominently annotated with the words "CLOSE WATCH" or the letters "CW", to
      facilitate the rapid identification of CLOSE WATCH missions.
      6.4.1.2. CPs monitoring Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) CLOSE WATCH
      missions will ensure the on-load and off-load contacts (airlift) or receivers (air refueling)
      are promptly notified of delays that effect on time operation of the mission and will
      advise them of the revised scheduling (T-2).
      6.4.1.3. PHOENIX BANNER/SILVER/COPPER Missions (Refer to AFI 11-289,
      Phoenix Banner, Silver, and Copper Operations). PHOENIX BANNER resources
      consist of designated aircraft and certified aircrews that support the President of the
      United States (POTUS). PHOENIX SILVER missions support the Vice President of the
      United States (VPOTUS). PHOENIX COPPER missions support the Secret Service.
      These missions have an established priority of 1A1 and will be tasked and mission
      managed as "CLOSE WATCH" missions by 618 AOC (TACC) (T-2). PHOENIX
      BANNER missions are the highest JCS priority missions flown by HQ AMC.
   6.4.2. CLOSE HOLD Missions. AMC operates certain missions that are highly sensitive.
   These missions place an unusual burden on the C2 system, since any facet of the mission
   may require special handling procedures and limited access. The sensitive information may
   include the itinerary, the material being transported, or the unit being supported. By
   identifying a mission as "CLOSE HOLD," HQ AMC limits the access to particular mission
   information and requires modification of certain C2 procedures. Real-time mission
   movement reporting WILL NOT be accomplished on CLOSE HOLD missions (T-2).
40                                                                  AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


  Specific modifications to normal C2 procedures, when required, are identified in the tasking
  order (mission operating directive, OPORD, etc.).
  6.4.3. PHOENIX PUSH. PHOENIX PUSH is a code name used to designate a mission with
  high-level interest from senior AF and DoD leadership, Congress, or the
  national/international media. PHOENIX PUSH may be designated for an entire mission or a
  particular segment of a mission; the designation may also be added after a mission has
  departed home station. While PHOENIX PUSH missions are CLOSE WATCH/CLOSE
  HOLD missions, they must receive special attention in addition to normal CLOSE
  WATCH/CLOSE HOLD procedures (T-2).
     6.4.3.1. Once a mission has been designated as PHOENIX PUSH, the GDSS CLOSE
     WATCH/CLOSE HOLD fields will be annotated, and a remark will be added indicating
     PHOENIX PUSH status (T-2).
     6.4.3.2. The PHOENIX PUSH designator mandates expeditious handling of the mission
     at all levels of operations.
     6.4.3.3. CP controllers will keep the 618 AOC (TACC) informed of any unusual actions
     relating to a PHOENIX PUSH mission. This must be done immediately, via the most
     expeditious communications means available, normally telephone. Due to the sensitive
     nature of PHOENIX PUSH missions, an advisory message will not suffice.
  6.4.4. Silent Running. Silent Running operations are designed to permit aircraft movement
  while minimizing the transmission of in-flight data and air/ground communications. They
  will operate within the C2 system and will be designated CLOSE HOLD missions (T-2).
  These missions will be preplanned to operate along a specified track or within a planned
  corridor to minimize conflict with other military missions or civilian air traffic (T-2). These
  procedures may be used in the event normal International Civil Aviation Organization
  (ICAO) procedures become unworkable or undesirable. CPs will not transmit to the aircraft
  unless (T-2):
     6.4.4.1. The aircraft commander requests information
     6.4.4.2. Emergency situations dictate
     6.4.4.3. Radio transmissions made at pre-determined times and with pre-determined
     information is required by the mission-operating directive
  6.4.5. Special Operations. While most special operations missions can be executed with
  either normal or CLOSE HOLD procedures, some missions operate outside the scope of the
  normal C2 system. In such cases, CPs will not be provided mission operating directives,
  OPORD, etc. No services will be required or expected from the CP. Special care must be
  exercised to preclude compromising such missions by queries as to the mission/status of the
  aircraft. Such queries will not be made without the specific approval of the aircraft
  commander (T-2). Special operations aircraft commanders or trusted agents will advise CPs
  of services required (T-2).
  6.4.6. Nuclear Airlift Operations. Nuclear airlift missions are all designated as CLOSE
  WATCH. The exact status of each mission is continuously monitored by the appropriate CP
  and the 618 AOC (TACC). Classification of nuclear mission information is governed by the
  USAF Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG), AF Nuclear Weapons Security
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                         41


   Classification Guide for Nuclear Weapons, mission directives, and nuclear transportation
   technical orders.
       6.4.6.1. Do not use terms that reveal nuclear cargo is on board a specific aircraft,
       mission, or at a specific location. The following guidelines are used for nuclear airlift
       missions (T-0):
           6.4.6.1.1. Do not try to talk around classified information on the radio, telephone, or
           message by substituting terms.
           6.4.6.1.2. When discussing a particular mission, use only the mission number or
           aircraft tail number. References to the mission number and itinerary are unclassified
           in themselves; however, including type of security required, mission priority, cargo
           data, or special regulations that reveal nuclear cargo is involved may be classified.
       6.4.6.2. The 618 AOC (TACC) exercises control over all AMC nuclear airlift missions.
6.5. Mission Movement Reporting. Real-time mission movement reporting is essential for
effective and responsive global C2.
6.6. Radio Discipline. Radio discipline is essential to mission effectiveness. CPs ensure only
information essential to mission execution and not available by other means will be transmitted
to, or requested from, airborne aircraft. Make every effort to exchange required information with
an aircrew prior to departure or after arrival, and by means other than radio when possible. CPs
may use voice call signs from Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) to identify military aircraft,
organizations, activities, and geographical locations when establishing and maintaining voice
communications (T-2).
6.7. Hazardous Weather/Runway Conditions. The C2 system must ensure local hazardous
weather and runway condition information is disseminated to appropriate agencies, and
confirmation is received from those agencies, when actions have been taken to prevent damage
to AF assets.
   6.7.1. CPs ensure meteorological watch (METWATCH) advisories, weather warnings, and
   runway surface condition data are received from weather units and AM Ops and
   disseminated to local agencies and departing/arriving aircraft (T-2).
   6.7.2. Commanders should establish procedures that provide "feedback" through the C2
   system to indicate METWATCH advisories, weather warnings, and runway surface
   conditions have been disseminated.
6.8. Aircraft Flying DV Personnel. All C2 facilities will notify the AF Watch of any USAF
aircraft carrying the DVs listed below that divert (T-2):
   6.8.1. POTUS/VPOTUS
   6.8.2. SECDEF
   6.8.3. CJCS/VCJCS
   6.8.4. SECAF
   6.8.5. SECSTATE
   6.8.6. All Service Chiefs

                                           Chapter 7

                      TRAINING, TESTING, AND CERTIFICATION

7.1. AF Master Training Plan (MTP). This chapter, the AF MTP, 1C3 CFETP, and AFI 36-
2201 contain specific instructions for documenting and administering the training program. The
AF 1C3 MTP consists of the AF Master Task List (MTL), CFETP, the AF Annual Training Plan
(ATP), Plans of Instruction (POI), and Performance Standards. All upgrade training is identified
and documented IAW AFI 36-2201, AF MTP, and 1C3 CFETP.
   7.1.1. AF MTL. The AF MTL is a comprehensive list of tasks performed within the career
   field. The AF MTL contains all CFETP Part II STS tasks. A reformatted version of the STS
   (found in the AF Form 623) is used as the AF MTL document and is attached to the MTP.
   The AF-mandated “CONTROLLER” duty position tasks for all CPs are listed in the AF MTL
   and must be trained to certify as a controller (T-1).
       7.1.1.1. The MTL is used in conjunction with MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/unit AF Form 797,
       Job Qualification Standard Continuation, if applicable, to create the unit MTL. NOTE:
       MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs/Units are encouraged to incorporate all non AF tasks under a
       related STS task and expand the new requirement in existing AF POIs, which will help
       eliminate the need for AF Form 797s and extraneous documentation.
   7.1.2. AF ATP. The ATP takes selected training received during initial training and applies
   it throughout the year for recurring training and proficiency.
   7.1.3. POI. POIs represent the minimum training standard for all tasks represented in the
   MTL and STS. By successfully completing a POI(s) teaching step(s), trainees achieve the
   minimum qualification standard for that task. The POIs identify three types of training
   standards:
       7.1.3.1. Knowledge. The use of mental processes that enable a person to recall facts,
       identify concepts, apply rules or principles, solve problems, and think creatively.
       Knowledge is obtained through self-study, training meetings, and testing.
       7.1.3.2. Performance. Part of a criterion objective that describes observable controller
       behavior (or the product of that behavior) that is acceptable to the evaluator as proof that
       learning has occurred.
       7.1.3.3. Both. Ability to recall facts, identify concepts, apply rules or principles, and
       demonstrate observable behavior, which pertains to the task.
   7.1.4. Performance Standards. Performance standards are developed for tasks identified as
   “Performance” or “Both”. Performance standards provide objectives with pre-existing
   conditions (when applicable), available resources (if applicable), allowable evaluator/trainer
   assists/errors, and a timeliness standard (when applicable) to clearly evaluate controller
   accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures in meeting the learning objective.
   7.1.5. Develop Unit Training Plan. The UTP is a single, comprehensive document
   consisting of the MTL, ATP, POIs, and Performance Standards, all integrated with
   AF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU and Unit-specific training items and requirements.(e.g. AF,
   USAFE, and Unit merged into one seamless document or AF, AMC, USAFE and Unit
44                                                                  AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


  merged into one seamless document). When applicable, units capture their specific mission
  requirements by selecting appropriate STS tasks, adding to the POIs, or adding an AF Form
  797, when required. The UTP is used to train personnel during initial training, recurring
  training, recertification training, skill-level upgrade training, and position qualification
  training. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs may develop more restrictive Command Standards for
  any of the areas below. Units are authorized to expand upon AF or MAJCOM standards for
  any of the areas below.
     7.1.5.1. AF Form 797. If a MAJCOM/FOA/DRU or unit AF Form 797 is developed, it
     will follow STS numbering in the applicable section (e.g., STS Task 3.1.11, Operate
     Tactical Systems, is supplemented as (ACC) 3.1.11.1, Operate COBRA, is used as a sub-
     bullet because “COBRA” is a Tactical System-Common Operating Picture). If not a sub-
     bullet, it must follow the next available number (e.g., STS Task 3.1.18. is the last task in
     the CP Systems/IT/Equipment section, by adding a new task that wouldn’t fall under any
     other task in that section it would be numbered as (ACC) 3.1.19.).
     7.1.5.2. MTL/STS Unit Task Identification.
         7.1.5.2.1. CP Managers and the NCOIC CP Training will identify all duty position
         training requirements and controller certification requirements using the STS/MTL
         (T-2).
         7.1.5.2.2. CP managers verify that all mission requirements are identified and trained
         (T-2).
         7.1.5.2.3. CP Managers and the NCOIC CP Training will develop a legend for the
         master CFETP identifying all the work center duty positions and task required for
         each position (T-2). The STS is documented and maintained IAW AFI 36-2201 (T-
         2).
     7.1.5.3. ATP.
         7.1.5.3.1. CP Managers and the NCOIC CP Training will identify tasks from the
         UTP for recurring training and determine the training standard (identified in para
         7.1.3.) and frequency (T-3).
             7.1.5.3.1.1. Tasks trained on a recurring basis through scenario, examinations, or
             formal training will be annotated on the ATP with an “X” in the applicable month
             column on the applicable task row.
         7.1.5.3.2. NCOIC CP Training will evaluate selected tasks marked as Performance or
         Both in either March or September (or both months) (T-2). Identify when the task
         will be evaluated by placing an “E” in the applicable evaluation month column on the
         applicable task row (T-2). Tasks will be trained in at least one of the months prior to
         the evaluation month (T-2).
         7.1.5.3.3. (If applicable) Added AF Form 797 Tasks. Tasks and subtasks requiring
         recurring training will be added to the ATP within the section it was added to on the
         AF Form 797.
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                        45


       7.1.5.4. POI.
          7.1.5.4.1. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Unit-specific tasks should be incorporated under an
          existing AF POI and the related STS task. If a similar STS task cannot be identified,
          then an AF Form 797 can be created. If an AF Form 797 is created, a new POI must
          be created to accompany it (T-2). POIs will include:
              7.1.5.4.1.1. References to specific instructions, manuals, pamphlets, OIs, and
              QRCs for each added task/subtask (T-2).
              7.1.5.4.1.2. NCOIC CP Training will establish a training standard to ensure
              trainee/controller proficiency on the added task/subtask (T-2).
              7.1.5.4.1.3. Teaching steps will be added to the task/subtask to ensure trainee
              receives all pertinent information required to accomplish the task/subtask (T-2).
       7.1.5.5. (If applicable) Adding Performance Standards. Create a performance standard
       for MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Unit-specific tasks added into existing POIs and/or any AF
       Form 797 tasks identified as Performance or Both (T-3).
7.2. CP Certification.
   7.2.1. Initial Training.
       7.2.1.1. Certified CP controllers administer all training. AFI 36-2201 identifies task-
       trainer requirements.
       7.2.1.2. CP controllers without CP console experience within the past 2 years will
       receive initial certification training (T-3).
       7.2.1.3. Initial certification training provides controllers with the knowledge and skills
       necessary to perform duties effectively at home station or in a deployed environment.
       During initial certification training, personnel will accomplish all training requirements
       identified in the STS and the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/unit 797 (if applicable) for
       certification as a controller (T-2).
       7.2.1.4. The NCOIC CP Training will conduct the initial orientation and evaluation,
       IAW AFI 36-2201, on behalf of the supervisor/rater (T-2). The orientation and
       evaluation with the trainee will be conducted within 5 duty days of entering training to
       determine the tasks to be trained and project a certification date (T-3).
   7.2.2. Certification Requirements.
       7.2.2.1. Written Examination
          7.2.2.1.1. General Knowledge Test (GKT)
          7.2.2.1.2. Emergency Actions Test
       7.2.2.2. Performance Evaluation
       7.2.2.3. Controllers performing PRP duties will be certified under PRP IAW DoD
       5210.42-R_AFMAN 13-501, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) (T-
       0). Administrative Qualification is not a certification.
46                                                                    AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


  7.2.3. Training Timelines.
     7.2.3.1. All controllers will enter training within 15 calendar days of reporting for duty to
     the CP (T-3).
     7.2.3.2. For Airmen participating in the First Term Airman Center (FTAC) program, the
     date entered training is the first duty day after FTAC completion. If a class date is not
     available within 15 days of date arrived station, initial certification training will begin and
     an annotation in the AF Form 623A, On the Job Training Record Continuation Sheet,
     will be made detailing the break in training (T-3). CP Controllers will not participate in
     any base detail that extends the FTAC program beyond the standard AF 2-week period
     (T-3).
     7.2.3.3. REGAF and full-time ARC CP managers will complete initial certification
     training within 120 calendar days of assuming the position (180 days for CP managers
     with an NC2 mission); if training goes beyond 120/180 days the MFM must be notified
     immediately (T-2).
     7.2.3.4. REGAF, full-time ARC, or Traditional Reservist (TR) CP controllers on 90
     consecutive Military Personnel Account (MPA) days will complete certification training
     within 90 calendar days from the date entered training (120 days for units with a NC2
     mission) (T-3). If training goes beyond 90/120 days, the MFM must be notified
     immediately (T-2).
     7.2.3.5. TR CP controllers not serving 90 consecutive MPA days will be certified within
     one year of reporting for duty (T-2). TR CP controllers not serving 90 consecutive MPA
     days in NC2 units will be certified within 18 months or 120 man-days, whichever comes
     first (T-2).
  7.2.4. Certification Authority.
     7.2.4.1. At CPs the installation commander or designated representative is the certifying
     official(s); this authority will not be delegated below the vice installation commander or
     director of staff (T-2).
         7.2.4.1.1. The CP Chief is authorized to recertify controllers who have been absent
         for 60 days or more, performing command post related duties (i.e., deployments). All
         other certification actions are the responsibility of the certifying official(s) (T-2).
         NOTE: CP Superintendents (regardless if CP Chief is assigned or available) are not
         authorized to recertify controllers.
     7.2.4.2. The certifying official(s) should conduct a personal interview with each CP
     controller prior to certification.
  7.2.5. Certification Documentation.
     7.2.5.1. Results of the certification tests and certification performance evaluation are
     recorded on the AF Form 4374, Command Post/Center Controller Certification Record
     (T-2).
     7.2.5.2. After the certifying official(s) has interviewed the controller and determined they
     are fully qualified, the certifying official(s) signs and dates the AF Form 4374 (T-2).
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                        47


       7.2.5.3. AF Form 4374s are maintained on each certified controller until the controller
       PCSs/PCAs (until arrival at new duty station), separates, or retires from his/her assigned
       unit. Do not re-accomplish certification documents when new certification forms are
       published or when the certifying official changes (T-3).
       7.2.5.4. For Consolidated CP/CP Association, AF Form 4374s should be signed by all
       applicable wing commanders with 1C3 personnel assigned to perform duties, for the
       Consolidated CP/ CP Association.
7.3. CP Recurring Training. The purpose of recurring training is to ensure CP controllers
remain qualified in all areas pertaining to their unit’s mission. This training is based on the
requirements established in the AF/MAJCOM/Unit ATP. The NCOIC CP Training will cover
tasks on the ATP through a combination of formal training meetings, self-study, and proficiency
training (T-3).
   7.3.1. Training meetings will be conducted in a classroom environment and occur a
   minimum of once per quarter (T-3).
       7.3.1.1. The NCOIC CP Training will document training meeting minutes, as well as the
       subtasks trained on the AF Form 4371, Record of Controller Formal Training (T-3). If
       short notice training was accomplished during the training meeting that was not listed on
       the ATP or self-study letter, it will be documented on the Form 4371 as supplemental
       formal training (e.g. recall procedures or areas of concern for a pending exercise need
       emphasis) (T-3).
       7.3.1.2. All CP controllers must attend the CP training meetings, unless excused by CP
       managers (T-3). The NCOIC CP Training will ensure all personnel not present at the
       training meeting receive training NLT 5 calendar days after returning to duty (T-3).
   7.3.2. Self-Study. The NCOIC CP Training will create a monthly self-study letter outlining
   that month’s training requirements, based on the ATP (T-3). All subtasks identified on the
   ATP for that month will be documented on the self-study letter (T-3). Additional training not
   required by the ATP can be added to the self-study letter each month without modifying the
   ATP. The self-study letter is signed by the CP Chief or Superintendent. Certified controllers
   thoroughly review all identified requirements, to include each teaching step within the POI of
   the identified task/subtask. CP managers ensure supervisors are involved with helping
   subordinates complete and understand self-study requirements. The self-study letter is
   published NLT the first day of each month. The self-study letter is retained in the CIF
   Binder until the next month (T-3).
       7.3.2.1. As a minimum, the self-study letter will contain the following information (T-3):
          7.3.2.1.1. When applicable, the agenda for the training meeting, (briefings, lectures,
          guest speakers, etc.)
          7.3.2.1.2. The task/subtask areas to be studied/reviewed (self-study) by all CP
          personnel
          7.3.2.1.3. The performance evaluation or scenario training schedule for the month, if
          applicable
          7.3.2.1.4. New/Revised publications and checklists
 48                                                                   AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


   7.3.3. Proficiency Training. Proficiency training consists of monthly written exams (EA and
   GKT) and performance evaluation or scenario training.
   7.3.4. Missed Training.
       7.3.4.1. Active-Duty/Full-Time ARC Personnel: All personnel absent from duty for 59
       days or less will review and make up all missed training not accomplished (e.g., training
       meetings, examinations, training scenarios, performance evaluations), within 10 calendar
       days of returning to duty (T-3). The NCOIC CP Training will ensure personnel are
       briefed on all procedural changes and/or significant events that occurred during their
       absence (T-3).
       7.3.4.2. TR and Drill Status Guardsmen (DSG) Personnel:
          7.3.4.2.1. TR and DSG personnel that miss monthly training, should review the
          C2CIF, and make up all missed training. Supervisors or the NCOIC CP Training will
          ensure personnel are briefed on all procedural changes and/or significant events that
          occurred during their absence. This training must be accomplished prior to assuming
          duty (T-3).
          7.3.4.2.2. TR and DSG personnel who miss two or more consecutive Unit Training
          Assembly (UTA) weekends will be decertified and entered into recertification
          training upon returning to duty (T-3). Prior to returning to duty, personnel will be
          recertified (T-3).
7.4. Controller Decertification.
   7.4.1. Decertification Requirements.
       7.4.1.1. Decertification. Personnel are decertified for several reasons, to include:
          7.4.1.1.1. Extended periods of absence longer than 60 days (T-3).
          7.4.1.1.2. Failure to maintain proficiency standards, to include failing three EA
          exams within a 6-month period or receiving an UNSAT on a performance evaluation
          (T-3).
              7.4.1.1.2.1. REGAF/full time ARC members failing to pass the monthly
              examinations will be required to complete a minimum of 8 hours of
              remedial/supplemental training (T-3). This training will take place on their next
              non shift/duty day (T-3). The failing member cannot be utilized as one of the on-
              duty controllers during this remedial/supplemental training (T-3). This training is
              documented in the AF 623A (T-2). ARC members will follow MAJCOM
              guidance.
          7.4.1.1.3. Security clearance withdrawal (T-1)
          7.4.1.1.4. AEF Deployments. Controllers will be decertified when tasked to deploy
          for 60 days or longer (T-3). Decertification will be documented once the controller
          has been gone for more than 60 days (T-3).
          7.4.1.1.5. Not working 2 shifts per month (T-2). NOTE: Certified controllers can
          take up to 59 days of consecutive leave or TDY without being decertified for not
          working two full shifts per month.
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                             49


   7.4.2. Removal from Career Field.
       7.4.2.1. Controllers who have been decertified for substandard performance two times
       within a 6-month period will be evaluated by CP managers and certifying official(s) for
       removal from the 1C3X1 AFSC (T-3). Controllers who have been decertified for
       substandard performance three times within a 6-month period will be removed from the
       1C3X1 AFSC, IAW with the AFECD (T-3). All reassignment, retraining, or discharge
       actions due to training deficiencies will be coordinated with the MFM and submitted
       through the local Force Support Squadron (FSS) (T-3).
   7.4.3. Decertification Authority. Decertification records can be signed by the CP Chief or
   certification authority.
   7.4.4. Decertification Documentation. The AF Form 4374 is used to decertify and recertify
   controllers.
7.5. Controller Recertification. Recertification training is a condensed version of initial
certification training. The NCOIC CP Training will identify if a trainee receives recertification
or initial certification training by conducting an evaluation of the trainee.
   7.5.1. If being recertified for a previous decertification, retrain only the deficient tasks (T-3).
   Controllers going through recertification training are not required to make up missed training
   given during absences (if applicable) (T-3).
   7.5.2. Recertification Documentation. The AF Form 4374 is used to decertify and recertify
   controllers.
7.6. Testing, Training, and Evaluations.
   7.6.1. Written Examination Requirements for Monthly Training and Certification.
       7.6.1.1. Examinations. A 90% score (critiqued to 100%) is required to pass all written

          documented on the AF Form 4372.
              7.6.2.6.2.1. An evaluation is rated as “SAT” if the controller completes all of the
              tasks within the number of allowable assists or errors identified in the
              Performance Standards portion of the MTP.
              7.6.2.6.2.2. An evaluation is rated as “UNSAT” if the controller exceeds the
              allowable number of assists or errors for an evaluated task identified in the
              Performance Standards portion of the MTP.
      7.6.2.7. Certification Scripts. Certification scripts will use actual and exercise EAM
      traffic and will follow performance evaluation ratings and scoring.
   7.6.3. The NCOIC, CP Training will ensure controller training materials (tests, scenarios,
   and evaluations) are properly controlled to prevent compromise or disclosure (T-0).
7.7. HHQ Testing.
   7.7.1. Higher Headquarters Testing. IG and MAJCOM P&P personnel may test controllers
   on CP procedures.
      7.7.1.1. Results of MAJCOM P&P-administered tests will not be used as the sole reason
      for decertification of an individual. Controller decertification recommendation should be
      based on overall performance during the HHQ visit and test failure.
      7.7.1.2. IAW all HQ EAP directives, the passing score for EA/Nuclear Control Order
      Procedures (NCOP) testing is 90%. During an IG inspection, if the entire unit’s HHQ
      EA/NCOP test average is below 90%, the section in the report where CP/EA/NCOP
      testing is documented will be rated UNSAT. Not applicable to AFRC CPs.

                               FACILITY REQUIREMENTS

8.1. General. This chapter outlines the minimum facility requirements for CPs.
   8.1.1. The working area for a CP is based on the functions performed and maximum number
   of personnel required to perform the tasks during peak periods. CP managers ensure the CP
   facility meets standards in UFC 4-010-01 DoD, Unified Facility Criteria; AFH 32-1084,
   Facility Requirements; AFI 31-101 and AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management
   Program Planning & Operations (T-1).
   8.1.2. When selecting a facility for the CP, commanders should consider survivability in a
   chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) environment, as well as its ability to
   provide protection against threats IAW AFI 10-2501.
   8.1.3. Commanders are not required to modify an existing CP to meet the specifics of this
   instruction, unless the CP is unable to support the unit’s mission or violates a standing
   security requirement outside of this AFI.
8.2. Construction Requirements (T-3 unless otherwise specified):
   8.2.1. Structure. Consoles, telephones, Information Technology (IT), and all other CP
   equipment will be set-up IAW current Information Assurance (IA) guidelines (e.g., AFSSI
   7700, Emissions Security; AFI 33-200, Information Assurance; AFI 33-201V1, Computer
   Security (COMSEC); AFI 33-201V2) and Information Protection Guidance (e.g., DoDM
   5200.01V1/V2, AFI 31-401) (T-0).
   8.2.2. Outer Door. The CP will have a primary external entrance door. As a minimum, the
   door will be of a construction type and installation that assures appropriate security IAW AFI
   31-101, and it will be equipped with a mechanical or electronically operated cipher lock or
   electronic badge system. The outer door can be either solid construction (if no inner door
   installed) or heavy metal-wire mesh (if inner door installed). If equipped with a key lock
   system, it will only be for emergency use.
   8.2.3. Inner Door. The inner entrance door (if installed) must be of solid construction,
   except for a reinforced window or peephole and securable credentials slot. Solid wood
   constructed doors will be reinforced externally with a steel sheet cover to prevent removal of
   the door. Ensure each external pin, bolt, screw, or other fastening device is protected to
   prevent removal. Doorframes shall be compatible with both the strength of the door and the
   adjoining wall construction, IAW AFI 31-101.
   8.2.4. EA Area. The EA area needs to be physically separated or shielded from view during
   EAM processing to limit access to formats and checklists during EA processing.
8.3. Facility Requirements (T-3):
   8.3.1. Emergency Power. All CPs will have an Emergency Generator system, IAW AFI 32-
   1063, Electrical Power Systems.
   8.3.2. Emergency Lighting. At a minimum the CP console area must be equipped with
   emergency lighting (i.e., battery-powered lighting).
 54                                                                   AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


       8.3.2.1. The CP should augment the emergency lighting system with flashlights (to
       include spare batteries and bulbs), to permit continued safe occupancy for at least 2 hours
       after a complete power loss or the length of time required to evacuate.
   8.3.3. Locks. Cipher pad or individually-pinned badge systems, approved IAW AFI 31-101
   for the CP protection level, are authorized for use on all CP inner, outer, EA area, and
   console doors.
       8.3.3.1. The outer and inner door to the standoff area will be equipped with a key on the
       exterior side of the door or door frame for emergencies. They must also provide remote
       unlocking capabilities from the console. Electronic locks must be configured so only one
       door is open at any time (to include remote unlocking from the consoles). In the event of
       failure, electronic locks will fail in the locked position and have a manual override to
       allow for emergency egress.
   8.3.4. Closed-Circuit Television. If the CP entrance is located where controllers would have
   to leave the console to perform personal identification, consider installing a closed-circuit
   television system. If this system is not available, one-way glass must be installed.
   8.3.5. Telephone. A telephone will be mounted on the exterior, next to the outer door. It
   should provide a direct line (hotline or speed dial) to the console. If hotline or speed dial is
   not available, CP managers will post phone numbers and instructions for dialing console
   controllers.
8.4. Facility Layout (T-3).
   8.4.1. EA Area or Console Area. CP managers will ensure there is a secure area within the
   facility to ensure protection of EACs and EA formats while processing EA (e.g. partitions
   blocking the view from other agencies or un-cleared personnel are acceptable). The console
   area must have adequate space for day-to-day operations and also for additional personnel
   during contingency operations. The console area must be fitted with a duress capability at
   each console position, terminating at the local monitoring facility (LMF)/remote monitoring
   facility (RMF), or Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC).
   8.4.2. CP Manager and Administrative Area. An area within the confines of the CP facility
   will be reserved for the CP Chief, Superintendent, and the administrative staff, with adequate
   office space to accommodate the number of personnel and any equipment necessary to
   perform their day-to-day duties. Privacy and close proximity to the console area are key
   considerations for the administrative area. The area will have workspace, seats, standard
   office equipment, and file storage.
   8.4.3. Training Area. An area within the confines of the CP facility will be reserved for the
   training area, with easy access to the console area, to facilitate training and testing of
   controllers. The area will have workspace, seats, standard office equipment, safes, and file
   storage.
   8.4.4. CAT Area. To ensure a good cross flow of information, a collocated CAT area is
   highly recommended. If not possible due to space limitations, secure communications (e.g.,
   dedicated phones, visual displays) must exist between the CP and CAT to ensure effective
   coordination.
   8.4.5. Other CP Areas.
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                         55


       8.4.5.1. Kitchen. CP managers will ensure controllers have proper food preparation and
       storage appliances (e.g., refrigerator and microwave) and a sink within the CP.
       8.4.5.2. Restrooms. CP managers will ensure sufficient restrooms support the maximum
       number of personnel required during peak periods (e.g., CAT activation). When
       possible, restrooms should be located within the CP secure area.
   8.4.6. Emergency Exit. All CPs must have an emergency exit that can only be opened from
   inside the CP. The doors must have an audible alarm for controllers on the console to be
   alerted when opened.
8.5. General CP Requirements (T-3). Ensure all CP console positions (e.g., senior, duty,
reports controller) are provided enough immediate workspace for computer systems, checklists,
and other material deemed necessary in the performance of the mission.
   8.5.1. Reproduction Equipment. The CP will have a copier authorized to reproduce, as a
   minimum, SECRET material located within the CP, in the immediate vicinity of the console.
   8.5.2. The console area will have a minimum of one 24-hour wall clock which displays a
   minimum of two time zones. One zone will be set to local time and the other set to Universal
   Time Coordinated (UTC) time. In addition, the clock must have a battery back-up.
8.6. ACP. (T-3): The goal for an ACP is to replicate the capabilities housed in the primary
facility. CP managers must develop procedures to perform CP duties from an alternate site
located away from the primary facility. This facility is not required to be an exact duplicate of
the primary CP, but must provide the ability to provide continued C2 capability and comply with
mission/PL requirements and communication systems, should the primary CP become
unusable/incapacitated.
   8.6.1. ACP Activation. CP managers will develop procedures to evacuate the primary
   facility in response to either an emergency situation requiring evacuation or commander
   directive. As a minimum, the following items should be addressed in the ACP activation
   procedures:
       8.6.1.1. Required Material. Either pre-position required materials or plan for the
       transportation of the material to the ACP.
       8.6.1.2. Information Updates. Provide primary and alternate methods for the timely
       transfer of pertinent information between the primary CP and the ACP, if applicable.
       8.6.1.3. Transfer of Control. Provide procedures for transfer control from the primary
       CP to the ACP and back, to include notification of appropriate HHQ agencies.
       8.6.1.4. Systems. ACP systems will be tested quarterly.
       8.6.1.5. Semiannual Activation. CP managers will ensure ACP is activated semiannually
       for a minimum of 2 consecutive hours. Activations as a result of real-world and or
       exercise events will fulfill the semiannual requirement, as long as all systems were tested
       and or activated. Document the activation on the events log or MFR and maintain in a
       file plan. for a minimum of 2 years.
8.7. CP Facility Remodeling (T-3): Prior to construction, CP managers will coordinate
design/plans with the installation Security Force Squadron (SFS) Information Security and
Physical Security section, Civil Engineering, Communications Squadron EMSEC personnel, and
 56                                                                AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014

                          SYSTEMS AND STATUS REPORTING

9.1. General Information. This chapter identifies typical communications systems and
capabilities in the CP.
9.2. C2 Systems and Applications. The following is a list of common C2 systems and
applications CPs use to carry out their C2 functions. The list is not all inclusive. Mandatory
items are identified below with the word (REQUIRED). (T-3 unless otherwise specified):
   9.2.1. (REQUIRED) Secure/Non-Secure           Internet     Protocol      Router   Networks
   (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) Computers. Access to SIPRNET/NIPRNET is required at each
   console position, allowing for proper information flow; operating communication database-
   run applications; mission monitoring; transmitting/receiving reports; and performing overall
   C2. Controllers must have active accounts and be able to log in to all systems.
   9.2.2. Land Mobile Radio (LMR). Radio communication service between mobile and land
   stations, or between mobile stations. LMRs are used for commanders’ quick-time recall and
   availability status. Other suitable systems, such as smart phones with mass notification
   capability, may be approved in lieu of LMRs.
   9.2.3. (REQUIRED) Secure Voice Communication.            Secure phones are encrypted
   telephone communication systems allowing units to discuss classified (e.g., REDSWITCH,
   STE, Voice over Secure IP [VOSIP]).
   9.2.4. (REQUIRED) Telephones or Communications Consoles.             Telephones or
   Communication consoles will meet requirements outlined in DoDI 8100.04., DoD Unified
   Capabilities (T-0).
   9.2.5. (REQUIRED) High-Frequency (HF)/Ultra High-Frequency (UHF)/Very-High-
   Frequency (VHF) Radio (at least one of the three). HF/UHF/VHF radios are used to
   communicate directly with aircraft and mission essential personnel and are mission
   dependent. As a minimum, all CPs, regardless of installation mission/configuration (e.g.,
   lack of an operational mission/active runway) should have a UHF radio, to facilitate C2 with
   aircraft transiting their area.
   9.2.6. (REQUIRED) INWS. INWS allows controllers to provide personnel installation-
   wide information such as: Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) levels, alarm
   conditions, FPCON/INFOCON changes, recalls, natural disaster warnings. The CP will be
   the lead INWS manager, and the primary INWS activation node will be located on console.
   9.2.7. GDSS. GDSS is a system for flight following MAF and SOF aircraft worldwide.
9.3. Controller Consoles. (T-3): Controller consoles should be centrally located to allow
controllers easy view of all display boards and other areas. As a minimum, the console area
must have console positions for two controllers, unless it is a non-operational CP. Consoles
must be configured with all the equipment required by controllers to perform CP duties. The
consoles should be side-by-side. The consoles should provide for rapid and assured selection of
radios, telephone systems, direct lines, remote controls, and voice recording capability. They
should also provide for ground-to-air, radio-to-wire phone patch, and conference calls. The
 58                                                                 AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014

      COMMAND POST SECURITY AND ENTRY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

10.1. Physical Security Considerations. It is the responsibility of CP managers, in conjunction
with the unit Resource Protection Program Manager, to ensure appropriate security measures are
in-place and maintained. The CP must be designated and controlled as a USAF Controlled Area
(PL-4) or Restricted Area (PL-1–3), IAW AFI 31-101 (T-2). Installation and tenant CPs that
function in the operational chain of command as C2 systems are designated the same PL as the
highest PL resource they support operationally (i.e. OPREP support doesn't equal operational
support). Tenant or geographically separated units are not in the wing’s operational chain of
command (T-2).
10.2. Entry and Circulation Control. (T-3 Unless otherwise specified): Entry and circulation
control procedures are based on the PL assigned to the facility and contained in each Installation
Security Instruction (ISI) or Installation Defense Plan (IDP) and in addition to AFI 31-101. The
CP must have procedures for CP entry and circulation control either in an OI or CBC. As a
minimum, the following areas will be addressed:
   10.2.1. Entry and Exit Procedures. Strict-entry procedures are required to provide adequate
   protection for personnel working inside the restricted area and to eliminate unnecessary
   traffic. Facility entry is controlled by properly trained individuals, granted unrestricted
   access and escort responsibilities into the facility during normal day-to-day operations.
   Armed SF, SF augmentees, and CAT augmentees trained in CP entry and circulation control
   procedures will control entry during CAT activation, contingencies, and increased FPCONs.
   All un-cleared, escorted visitors will be announced to the on-duty controller team when
   transiting common CP facility space (outside of the EA area or console area) for situational
   awareness. Unit procedures must comply with the following, when applicable:
       10.2.1.1. During routine operations, only one door of an entrapment/standoff area may
       be open at a time.
       10.2.1.2. During routine operations, personnel exiting the CP should ensure the
       entrapment/standoff area is clear (i.e., no one in entrapment/standoff area) before opening
       the inside door. When an entry controller (SF/SF Augmentee/CAT augmentee) is
       present, he or she controls access into the entrapment/standoff area and CP.
   10.2.2. IG team members and SAV/Functional Assistance Visit (FAV) team members are
   not required to have the locally-designated CP area numbers open on their Restricted Area
   Badges (RAB); inspectors and evaluators will use their own military ID (CAC), RAB, and/or
   advanced entry control card from their home station for entry, if a valid EAL is in place.
   10.2.3. Escorted entry will be IAW AFI 31-101 controlled or restricted area procedures. CP
   managers will ensure there are procedures to preannounce the presence of escorted personnel
   requiring authorized entry to a restricted area.
   10.2.4. In the console/EA area, ensure only authorized personnel have viewing access to
   EACs and formats IAW applicable EAP guidance.
   10.2.5. CAT Operations. During CAT or high-density operations, when an armed SF
   member/SF augmentee/CAT augmentee has been posted, they should be given the cipher
 60                                                                AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


   lock combinations to CP inner and outer doors to control entry (not the EA area door, if
   equipped). The cipher lock combinations are changed immediately upon completion of the
   exercise, operation, or resolution of the crisis situation.
10.3. EALs/Access Lists. The CP maintains all permanent EALs, active one-time EALs, and
EALs applicable for duration of evaluations/inspections/exercises (T-3). All EALs are validated
and authenticated according to AFI 31-101 (T-2).
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                         61


                                          Chapter 11

                  COMMAND POST CONTINGENCY DEPLOYMENTS

11.1. Contingency Deployments.
   11.1.1. In support of crises and contingencies, the USAF and CP career field are committed
   to provide forces where and when needed throughout the world. Preparing CP personnel for
   deployment is necessary and entails requirements and actions to be completed; also known as
   personnel readiness responsibilities.
   11.1.2. To achieve maximum personnel readiness, IAW AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s Manual,
   Section 2, complete all required items given by the Unit Deployment Manager (UDM). (T-3)
11.2. Contingency Training.
   11.2.1. The AFCFM and MFMs are encouraged to attend the Contingency Wartime
   Planning Course (CWPC), at Maxwell AFB, AL. This course provides senior leaders and
   managers with a foundation of knowledge in Joint and AF contingency and deliberate
   planning processes and systems.
11.3. Contingency Management. Contingency management ensures personnel and equipment
are properly sourced to meet the demands of wartime/contingency operations. Based on CP
manager inputs, MFMs posture all MAJCOM 1C3X1 resources in UTC Availability.
AFPC/DPW recommends sourcing of resources to meet worldwide-contingency requirements,
based upon what is postured within the AEF Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD)
Library. MFMs validate AFPC/DPW recommendations, and then the tasking flows to the unit
via a Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Levy.
   11.3.1. AEF Assignment.
       11.3.1.1. All controllers will be assigned an AEF tempo band, ensure each Airman
       knows the specific AEF band and block they are assigned (T-1). This provides each
       Airman with stability and predictability of their AEF deployment window.
       11.3.1.2. CP managers will assign controllers, by name, to a specific UTC and ensure
       controllers know which tempo band they are assigned to within 15 days of arrival on
       station (T-1).
           11.3.1.2.1. CP managers should ensure their resources (controllers) are evenly
           distributed across all bands, to prevent being over-tasked in a single band, as well as
           providing AFPC/DPW personnel in every band.
           11.3.1.2.2. Before placing a controller in a tempo band, CP managers should
           consider factors such as the member’s date arrived station, previous deployments, and
           any other factors which may impact their ability to deploy in an assigned band. Once
           assigned to a tempo band, the member remains in that tempo band, IAW AFI 10-401.
11.4. CP Post Deployment Critique. MFMs and CP managers ensure CP personnel returning
from a deployment complete a CP Post Deployment Critique Form (Attachment 4) within 30
calendar days of returning to duty (T-2). Critiques are reviewed by the individual’s CP managers
and sent to the MFM. MFMs forward all critiques to the AFCFM for review and action.

Terms
Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP)—An AMC document that provides flight crews with
winded, optimized flight plans for improved fuel economy and increased payloads. The flight
planner uses a Microsoft Windows based interface and communicates with the mainframe
located at Scott AFB, IL. Once the optimized flight plans are calculated, they are returned to the
user. Flight plans can be received in a format which will allow the user to open that flight plan
in PFPS (Portable Flight Planning Software), ultimately allowing the user to manipulate the data
and/or load the flight plan electronically into the aircraft mission computer. Creates electronic
flight plan Forms 175 and 1801 for filing with FAA. Database derived from Digital
Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) provided by NIMA. Future developments include
a web-based interface and improved interoperability with Air Force Mission Support System
(AFMSS) and AMC C2 systems.
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)—Airlift service provided for the movement of patients by AMC
aircraft assigned for aeromedical evacuation purposes.
Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF)—An organization comprised of air and space
capabilities that provides tailored force packages to meet combatant commander needs across the
full spectrum of military operations. AEFs are inherently capable of performing one or more of
the AF’s basic functions: Counterair, counterspace, counterland, countersea, strategic attack,
counterinformation, C2, airlift, air refueling, spacelift, space support, special operations
employment, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat search and rescue. The
fundamental underpinning to the sustained execution of these functions is the AF’s ability to
provide the full complement of Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) forces.
Air Mobility Control Center (AMCC)—AMCC is the functional name for the C2 flight that is
a part of each AMS. AMCCs provide C2 support at key en route locations. Normally OCONUS
AMCCs manage all aircraft and aircrews operating AMC and AMC-gained missions through
their location. Assigned personnel monitor strategic mobility missions, report mission
movement, and coordinate ground support activities to include maintenance, aerial port services,
and aircrew support for all AMC and AMC-gained missions transiting their station.
Air Mobility Division (AMD)—The AMD of an AOC plans, coordinates, tasks, and executes
air mobility operations for the COMAFFOR/JFACC. As one of the five divisions of the AOC
under the AOC Director, the AMD provides integration and support of all JOA air mobility
missions. The AMD Chief ensures the division effectively participates in the AOC planning and
execution process. The AOC director provides policy and guidance to the AMD regarding the
air and space planning and execution process. The AMD tasks intratheater air mobility forces
through wing and unit CPs when those forces operate from home bases, and through applicable
forward C2 nodes. The AMD usually consists of the following four teams: the air mobility
control team (AMCT), the airlift control team (ALCT), the air refueling control team (ARCT),
and the aeromedical evacuation control team (AECT). The DIRMOBFOR should be collocated
in the AOC to facilitate their close working relationship with the AMD.
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                         77


Air and Space Operations Center (AOC)—The senior agency of the AF component
commander that provides C2 of AF air and space operations and coordinates with other
components and services.
Augmented Aircrew—A basic aircrew supplemented by additional aircrew members to permit
in-flight rest periods. As a minimum, an augmented crew provides for in-flight rest for
crewmembers, if they are authorized and required for aircraft being flown or missions being
performed.
Authentication—A security measure designed to protect a communication system against the
acceptance of fraudulent transmission or simulation by establishing the validity of a message,
transmission, or originator.
Change Of Operational Control (CHOP)—The date and time (Greenwich Mean Time-GMT)
at which the responsibility for operational control of a force or unit passes from one operational
control authority to another. The CHOP point is the geographical position where responsibility
for operational control of a mission is transferred.
CLOSE HOLD Missions—Certain highly sensitive missions that require special handling,
limited access, and modification to normal C2 procedures.
CLOSE WATCH Missions—Term used to ensure designated missions receive special
attention, all possible actions are taken to ensure on-time accomplishment, and users are notified
when delays occur or can be anticipated.
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2
functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications,
facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and
controlling forces/operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Command and Control System—The facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and
personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing, and controlling operations of
assigned forces pursuant to the mission.
Command Center—The Command Center serves as the Higher Headquarters (HHQ) full-time
24/7 C2 node. The Command Center is a direct representative of the HHQ commander and
serves as the focal point of the HHQ operation, and as such receives and disseminates laterally,
up and down the chain-of-command, orders, information, and requests necessary for the C2 of
assigned forces and operations.
Command Post (CP)—The CP serves as one of the Installation Command and Control (IC2)
full-time 24/7 C2 nodes, directly responsible to the installation commander for IC2. The CP is a
direct representative of the (installation) commander and serves as the focal point of the unit
operation, and as such receives and disseminates orders, information, and requests necessary for
the C2 of assigned forces and operations.
Command Post Managers—The CP Chief and Superintendent directly in charge of the CP.
NOTE:—Unless specifically addressed, the use of the term ―CP managers in this AFI implies
actions may be completed by either the Chief or Superintendent.
 78                                                                    AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014


Contingency Response Group (CRG)—CRGs are designed to be first responders for opening
airbases. These units will bridge the gap between the seizure forces and the follow-on
combat/expeditionary combat support forces. CRGs are critical to the AF’s ability to rapidly
deploy U.S. military forces and initiate air operations of any type in minimal time at any base or
location around the globe. CRGs may also provide C2, aerial port services, quick turn
maintenance, force protection and various airbase support capabilities for AMC’s Global
Mobility mission. The CRG CONOPs and AFI 10-202, Contingency Response Groups, describe
CRG operations.
Crisis Action Team (CAT)—A staff formed by the commander to plan, direct, and coordinate
forces in response to contingencies, crises, natural/manmade disasters, or wartime situations.
The CAT develops courses of action and executes the commander's and HHQ’s directives. The
composition and function of the CAT is largely mission driven and therefore a MAJCOM or unit
commander prerogative. However, membership for the CAT is most frequently a combination
of the commander’s senior staff and special staff which includes a CP representative. The
composition of a CAT varies according to the situation.
Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS)— As a capabilities-based system, DRRS
indicates what tasks a unit can accomplish, based upon the mission(s) for which a unit was
organized or designed. DRRS provides this information on measured units at a specific point in
time. This information supports crisis planning, deliberate planning, and management
responsibilities to organize, train, and equip combat-ready forces for the Combatant
Commanders (CCDRs).
Defense Switching Network (DSN)—The basic general-purpose switched voice network of the
Defense Communications System (DCS).
Diversion—Operational term for the in-flight change of an aircraft's intended destination to any
other airfield. Diversion is differentiated from a reroute in that a diversion occurs during flight.
DV/VIP—Distinguished visitor/very important person. Military passengers, including those of
friendly nations, of star, flag rank, or equivalent status to include diplomats, cabinet members,
and members of Congress. Others may be designated as VIPs due to their mission or position by
the agency of the DoD authorizing the individual's travel. BLUE BARK passengers are handled
by AMC as VIPs. DV/VIP Codes are listed in the DoD Flight Information Publication, General
Planning, Table A1.1 para 4-3:

7—Colonels (USAF, USA, USMC)/Captains (USN/USCG) (O-6), GS/GM-15
Emergency Actions (EA)—The term used by C2 agencies identifying actions, procedures, and
communications used during periods of tension or increased readiness, whether or not an
increased LERTCON/DEFCON has been declared.
Emergency Action Message (EAM)—Messages through which JCS and subordinate
commanders pass significant directives to their forces.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—The central emergency management C2 element for
expanded emergency or contingency response operations that require additional support beyond
the Incident Command Staff capabilities; including major accidents, natural disasters, enemy
attack, and terrorist use of CBRNE materials. The EOC is organized into 15 Emergency Support
Functions (ESF), as mandated by the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) and
identified in AFI 10-2501.
En Route Station—Station between points of origin and destination at which missions will stop.
Flight Manager—Flight Managers are trained in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-255, Volume
1, Integrated Flight Management Training, and evaluated and certified IAW FAA, AF, and
MAJCOM standards. Flight Managers confirm information (weather, NOTAM, intelligence)
needed to plan assigned sorties is accurate, complete, and de-conflicted; create risk-mitigated
flight plans; file flight plans with Air Traffic Service (ATS), prepare, publish, and transmit
accurate and complete ADPs, provide verbal departure briefings to aircrews when contacted by
the aircrew, flight watch the sortie from takeoff to landing assisting aircrews in execution as
required, and coordinate sortie mission issues with appropriate authorities. They serve as the
focal point of a centralized support network which proactively monitors the sortie’s operational
environment, predicatively analyzes changes in key information elements that could pose
hazards/risks to sortie success, derives alternatives and pushes actionable plans (dynamic re-
tasking) to the aircrew and ATS.
Force Protection Condition (FPCON)—The FPCON system is a program standardizing the
military services identification of, and recommended responses to terrorist threats against U.S.
personnel and facilities. FPCONs are declared IAW AFI 31-101. Complete descriptions and
measures are detailed in AFI 10—245, Antiterrorism(AT).
Global Decision Support System (GDSS)— GDSS is used for MAF and SOF aircraft
worldwide. It is also used by CAF for selected missions. It is capable of unclassified/classified

application training.
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)—Also called Zulu time. Used as the standard time throughout
the world.
Hazardous Cargo/Materials— Explosive, toxic, caustic, nuclear, combustible, flammable,
biologically infectious, or poisonous materials that may directly endanger human life or property,
particularly if misused, mishandled, or involved in accidents.
Information Operations Condition (INFOCON)—Identifies the criteria for posturing forces to
combat attacks against our information infrastructure. INFOCONs will be established to defend
against a different type of warfare that is not limited to physical boundaries. INFOCONs address
protection of AF assets against electronic offensive actions and defensive countermeasures,
jamming, and denial of service. They will also prompt the response to generate offensive forces
and detail defensive countermeasures. An INFOCON establishes specific alert levels and
defines graduated response AF commanders must take at all organizational levels.
Installation Commander—The individual typically responsible for all operations performed by
an installation, normally the host unit commander.
Installation Command and Control (IC2)—The IC2 construct provides the commander of a
USAF home station or a deployed AEW/AEG to an expeditionary base with a single,
consolidated C2 center from which to monitor, assess, plan, and execute the full range of
installation activities. A key function of IC2 is the CP; other key IC2 functions may include the
CAT, MOC, EOC, SFD, Fire (911), and a basic intelligence function. Regardless of physical
location, all IC2 nodes should be linked virtually (virtual IC2) to expedite information flow
during disasters/contingencies.
Installation Notification and Warning Systems (INWS)—The INWS is a combination of
methods using audible and visual signals, verbal messages, and electronic communication.
Communication modes include sirens, horns, radio tone alerting, MNS, unaided voice
systems, public and broadcast address systems, local area network messaging, telephone
alert conferencing, pagers, television, radio, flags, signs, and other electronic or mechanical
methods. See UFC 4—021-01, Design and O&M: Mass Notification Systems for details about
warning standards.
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Codes—Four letter codes that identify
specific locations. The first letter indicates the ICAO region and the nation/location by the last
three letters. All Continental US codes begin with "K." (For example: "KCHS" designates
Charleston AFB and "KDOV" stands for Dover AFB.) This listing also includes Encode and
Decode listings, e.g., 4-letter code to airport and airport to 4-letter code.
Jabber—Common instant messaging platform that works in a fashion similar to chat rooms,
using a distributed architecture. CPs utilize SIPRNet Jabber to transmit time-sensitive
operational information (AF OPREP-3s).
Mission Management—The function of organizing, planning, directing, and controlling airlift
and/or tanker mission operating worldwide. Mission management includes mission execution
AFI10-207 11 JUNE 2014                                                                           81


authority, the authority to direct where and when a mission goes and what it does once it arrives
there.
Mission Monitoring—The function of organizing, planning, directing (limited), and controlling
aircraft operations. Mission monitoring does not include mission execution authority.
Operations Center—The facility or location on an installation/base used by the commander to
command, control, and coordinate all crisis activities.
Operational Readiness—JCS defines Operational Readiness as the capability of a unit, weapon
system, or equipment to perform the mission or function it is organized or designed to undertake.
It may also be used in general sense to express a level or degree of readiness posture. When used
in this latter context, JCS has directed all references to readiness posture be classified a minimum
of SECRET.
Operational Unit—A numbered AF organization, which employs assigned combat air, space
and cyber forces, and is listed in USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 3, Part 1,
Combat Forces (WMP-3).
Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF)—Designated AMC airlift squadrons and aircrews trained
and certified for peacetime movement of nuclear cargo.
Rescue Coordination Center (RCC)—A primary search and rescue facility suitably staffed by
supervisory personnel and equipped for coordinating and controlling search and rescue and/or
combat search and rescue operations. Personnel of a single service or component operate the
facility unilaterally.
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM)—Those airlift requirements that require special
consideration due to the number of passengers involved, weight or size of cargo, urgency of
movement, sensitivity, or other valid factors that preclude the use of channel airlift.
Special Air Mission (SAM)—Those missions operated by the 89 AW in support of the special
airlift requirements of the DoD.
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS)—The Joint Staff controlled system that
provides authoritative identification, location, and resource information to the President,
Secretary of Defense, and the JCS.
Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb)—provides net-centric, asynchronous,
collaborative event management capability in order to improve situational awareness for all
SIPRNET and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) authorized users.
Very, Very Important Parts (VVIP)—A designation applied to certain spare aircraft parts
which due to their high value, critical shortage, or immediate need to support NMCS
requirements, must receive special handling during shipment.
