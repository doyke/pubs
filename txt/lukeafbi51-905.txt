1. Authority. Commanders of military installations may summarily bar persons whose
presence, in their judgment, might hinder the mission or adversely affect the health, safety, or
morale of the persons assigned there. This authority proceeds from Article 1, Section 3, and
Article 2, Section 2, of the United States Constitution; Title 50, United States Code, Section 797,
and DoDD 5200.8, Security of Department of Defense (DoD) Installations and Resources.
Under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1382, a person who violates an order not to enter or
reenter may be prosecuted in federal court and may be fined not more than $5,000.00, or
imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

     individuals except DD Form 1173, Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card,
     identification card holders, civilian employees of Luke AFB (to include NAF employees) and
     active or reserve military members.
     2.2. 56 SFS will serve an Immediate Debarment Order to all subjects who have committed
     the offenses determined by the 56th Fighter Wing Commander (56 FW/CC) to be prejudicial
     to the good order and discipline of Luke AFB, as listed in paragraph 9.
        2.2.1. When an on-duty Security Forces member determines that an unaffiliated civilian
        has committed an offense listed in paragraph 9, the SFS member will contact his flight
        chief to coordinate the issuance of an Immediate Debarment Order. If, after coordination
        with the flight chief, SFS desires consultation regarding whether an offense listed in
        paragraph 9 has been committed, the SFS member will contact the on-call Judge
        Advocate General (JAG) over the phone (623-337-6548) for assistance.
            2.2.1.1. The Immediate Debarment Order will include the act committed as listed in
            paragraph 9, the date and location of the offense, the length of debarment in
            accordance with paragraph 9, the right of the subject to appeal the debarment, the
            address of the appeals office (56 FW/CC through 56 FW/JA), and a receipt
            acknowledgement signature line for the subject. A sample copy of the Immediate
            Debarment Order is located at Attachment 1.
            2.2.1.2. Subjects are to be read the Immediate Debarment Order and sign a receipt
            for the order. The subject will acknowledge receipt by signing and dating a prepared
            endorsement on the bottom of the Immediate Debarment Order. All copies of the
            Immediate Debarment Order must contain this endorsement. If subject refuses to
            sign the endorsement, the issuing member should write “Subject refused to sign” in
            the signature block and sign their name and date below that statement.
     2.3. The effect of the Immediate Debarment Order is immediate and continuous throughout
     the appeal process.

     3.7. 56 FW/CC must review the package and make the final decision on the recommended
     action. 56 FW/CC will sign debarment orders: This authority may not be delegated to
     subordinates. The package is then returned to 56 FW/JA who will inform 56 FSS/FSMC,
     56 FSS/FSMH, or the subject’s commander of 56 FW/CC’s decision.
     3.8. After a debarment order is signed the package will be forwarded to 56 SFS for update of
     the existing debarment list.
     3.9. The effect of the debarment is immediate upon receipt by the debarred individual and
     remains in effect throughout the appeal process.
4. Distribution and File of Debarment Order.
     4.1. When possible, debarment orders that are issued in conjunction with resignation,
     removal for cause, or discharge will be served to the subject of the order by supervisors (for
     civilian employees), commanders (for military members), or their delegees.
     4.2. 56 FW/JA will mail debarment orders that are not Immediate Debarment Orders and are
     not personally served on debarred individuals.
        4.2.1. Mailing Debarment Order. The debarment order will be sent to the subject by
        certified mail with an envelope marked “Deliver to Addressee Only.” In every case of
        mailing, a certificate of service must be completed. When the PS Form 3811, Domestic
        Return Receipt, is returned to the sender and reflects delivery made, the PS Form 3811
        will be attached (stapled) to the file copy of the debarment order. If PS Form 3811 is
        returned with the remarks “unclaimed,” a recheck for proper address, etc., must be
        accomplished and a second mailing completed. If the second notice is returned
        “unclaimed,” both PS Forms 3811 must be attached to the original copy of the Order and
        placed in the debarment package. No further attempts will be made to locate the subject
        unless new verified data becomes available. The subject’s name will be added to the

      14185 West Falcon Street
      Luke AFB, AZ 85309-1629

SUBJECT: Debarment from Luke AFB, Arizona

1. On 16 May 07, you were notified you were being removed for cause, or you submitted your
resignation prior to removal action.

2. Based upon this recommendation, I consider your continued presence on this installation to be
detrimental to the maintenance of good order and discipline. Effective immediately, you are
ordered not to enter Luke AFB, to include all annexes and lease-back facilities, for a period of
two years. Should any compelling reason exist that you believe is sufficient to justify a
modification or termination of this order, submit such reason, in writing, to 56 FW/JA, 7383 N.
Litchfield Road, Suite 2040, Luke AFB, AZ 85309.

3. If you fail to comply with this order, you will be in violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1382, which reads:

   Whoever, within the jurisdiction of the United States, goes upon any military, naval, or
   Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, for any
   purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation; or

   Whoever reenters or is found within such reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station,
   or installation, after having been removed therefrom or ordered not to reenter by any
   officer or person in command or charge thereof --

   Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

4. Should you reenter or be found within the limits of Luke AFB, to include all annexes and
lease-back facilities, in violation of this order, you will be subject to detention by military
authorities for prompt delivery to the appropriate civil authority.

5. If you are entitled to medical treatment at Base Medical Facilities, you may enter the base
for the sole purpose of obtaining medical treatment. To do so, you must present this letter to
the security forces personnel at the main gate and obtain the appropriate visitor pass. You may
not deviate from this route, nor stop for any reason on your way to and from the facility.

6. This order will remain in effect until revoked or modified, in writing, by the installation
commander. If you desire reconsideration or modification of this order, you may present your
justification to me, in writing, through the Staff Judge Advocate at Luke AFB.
