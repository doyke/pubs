1. BASH Program Information.
     1.1. General. This plan establishes a hazard abatement program to minimize bird and
     terrestrial animal strikes. Daily and heavy seasonal bird movements in the vicinity of Minot
     AFB create the most serious hazards to local and transient aircraft, if unchecked by local
     agencies. Due to the dynamic situation presented by birds and mammals, no single solution
     to the bird/wildlife strike problem exists. This document outlines mitigation techniques,
     directs BASH activities, and tasks organizations within the wing to support the program. This
     plan is designed to:
        1.1.1. Establish a Bird/Wildlife Hazard Working Group (BHWG) and designate
        responsibilities to its members.
        1.1.2. Establish procedures to identify potentially hazardous situations and to aid
        aircrews and supervisors in altering/discontinuing flying operations when warranted.
        1.1.3. Establish aircraft and airfield operating procedures to mitigate hazardous
        situations.
        1.1.4. Provide a system to disseminate BASH information to all assigned and transient
        aircrews on specific bird hazards and procedures for avoidance.
        1.1.5. Establish guidelines to decrease the attractiveness of the airfield to birds and
        mammals IAW AFI 32-1053.
        1.1.6. Provide guidelines for dispersing birds/wildlife when their presence on the airfield
        constitutes a viable threat to aircraft.
     1.2. Situation. Minot AFB is located in northwestern North Dakota in the Central and
     Mississippi flyways, 15 miles southeast of the Lake Darling Wildlife Refuge. The base is in
     Ward County, 8 miles north of the city of Minot. The airfield altitude measures 1,668 feet
     above sea level. Mean annual precipitation in the area is 17.2 inches. The total installation
     size is 1,907 hectares (HA) (4,714 acres) of which 820 HA (2,026 acres) are improved, 839
     HA (2,074 acres) are semi-improved, and 248 HA (614 acres) are unimproved. The base
     contains a wide variety of native prairie grasses and broadleaf plants. The base itself contains
     substantial standing water in spring and summer that acts as a major attractant for waterfowl,
     wading birds, and gulls. The surrounding off-base agricultural region provides a substantial
     food source for migrating waterfowl. Hazards exist on or around the airfield year round with
     an increase from March through November and peak activity during the spring and the fall
     migrations. The majority of bird strikes occur in the summer months involving small birds
     such as swallows that generally do not cause damage.
MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                                3


     1.2.1. Phase I/II. The bird population is low in the winter, and is typically moderate in
     the vicinity of the airport throughout the year at Minot AFB, significant increases in
     hazardous migratory bird activity occur during the BASH Phase II period. Phase II is
     defined as April-June and September-November migratory seasons. All other times
     throughout the year are classified as BASH Phase I.
  1.3. Specific hazards. Flying safety on the aerodrome will be significantly increased through
  habitat management, active bird hazard abatement methods, effective warning techniques,
  and depredation, as necessary.
     1.3.1. Waterfowl. Large flocks of waterfowl present the greatest threat during the
     migration seasons. Waterfowl transiting to and from Lake Darling over-fly the base.
     Waterfowl roost on the sewage lagoons during the spring and fall seasons, posing a
     limited threat to operations. Historically, migrating birds rarely fly higher than 100 feet
     when transiting from lagoon to lagoon on or near the base and can be monitored by the
     Minot AFB Tower. Mitigation efforts include use of pyrotechnics, aggressive use of the
     Bird Watch Condition (BWC) program, depredation, and vigilance from both ground and
     air personnel with manipulation of flight paths when needed.
     1.3.2. Birds of prey. Periodically, hawks and falcons soar over and near Minot AFB's
     runways in search of food. While searching, they often fly co-altitude with aircraft on the
     approach or departure flight paths. Mitigation efforts include maintaining the proper
     airfield grass height and eliminating potential prey (to discourage their hunting on the
     airfield), capture and relocation by qualified personnel, and the use of pyrotechnic
     dispersal techniques.
     1.3.3. Gulls. Gulls present a hazard in late summer when they hunt for grasshoppers
     around the airfield. Dispersal techniques include, but are not limited to, vehicle patrols,
     the use of pyrotechnics, and depredation.
     1.3.4. Mammals. The presence of whitetail deer in the local area represents an additional
     hazard to aircraft as the potential damage from an aircraft striking a deer is significant.
     Largely nocturnal feeders, the local deer population poses the greatest threat during
     periods of darkness with high illumination. Periodically, small groups of deer gain access
     to the airfield. In addition, a local white-tailed jack rabbit population also presents a
     limited threat. Found throughout the base, these animals seldom frequent the airfield.
     However, combined with a large Richardson’s ground squirrel population, jackrabbits
     provide a food source for predatory birds. Mitigation efforts include diligent inspection of
     flight line fencing to quickly discover and repair holes and means of entry for the
     animals, mounted and dismounted patrols of the airfield, use of pyrotechnics, diligent
     action by base agencies to assure airfield access gates are closed, and depredation of
     terrestrial wildlife threats when necessary.
  1.4. Passive BASH Risk Mitigation Measures.
     1.4.1. BHWG
         1.4.1.1. Function. Collects, compiles, and reviews data on bird strikes, identifies and
         recommends actions to reduce hazards. Recommends changes in operational
         procedures. Prepares informational programs for aircrews. Assists the commander by
         acting as a point of contact for off-base issues.
4                                                 MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


       1.4.1.2. Authority. The BHWG submits all recommendations to the operational
       commander for approval. Implementation is through normal chain of command.
       1.4.1.3. Composition. The chairman will be the 5 BW/CV. As a minimum, the group
       will consist of a representative from 5 BW/SEF, 91 MW/SEF, 5 OG/CC, 5 BW/JA, 5
       MXG, Airfield Management Operations (5 OSS/OSAA), Air Traffic Control (5
       OSS/OSAT), Civil Engineer (5 CES/CEO), Roads and Grounds (5 CES/CEOHP),
       Environmental Analysis (5 CES/CEAN), 23 BS/SEF, 69 BS/SEF, 54 HS/SEF, and 5
       OG/SOF.
       1.4.1.4. Meeting schedule. Semiannually, prior to the beginning of the spring and fall
       migrations or more often as necessary.
    1.4.2. Habitat modification. By incorporating specific practices into the base land
    management plan, Minot AFB can maintain a flight line habitat less attractive to birds
    and other wildlife. Any base beautification or wetland enhancement plans will be
    coordinated through Wing Safety           (5 BW/SE), Base Legal (5 BW/JA), Civil
    Engineering (5 CES/CEO), and Airfield Management (5 OSS/A3AA) IAW AFI 13-204
    Volume 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs.
       1.4.2.1. Managing grass height. Refer to AFI 91-202. Civil Engineering will mow to
       maintain a uniform grass height between 7 and 14 inches “effective height.” This
       refers to the grass depth after it is cut, not the actual height of the mower blade. Grass
       of this length deters birds by either preventing them from efficiently locating food
       sources close to the ground and/or preventing them from seeing the approach of
       predators. Fast growing species of weeds should be eliminated or reduced by the
       controlled use of herbicides or other methods. Do not allow grass to exceed 14
       inches, as tall grass will attract additional bird species and rodents which, in turn,
       attract birds of prey, deer, and waterfowl. Begin mowing adjacent to runways and
       finish in the infield or outer-most grass areas. This will cause insects and other
       animals to move away from aircraft takeoff and landing areas. Cut grass before it
       goes to seed to discourage granivorous birds from feeding on the airfield. The
       following agencies will aid the 5 CES in maintaining a uniform grass effect:
           1.4.2.1.1. The fire department will mow the sod grass 10 feet beyond the asphalt
           road behind the fire department. The front lawn of the fire department may be
           mowed short for base beautification. All other grass around the building and on
           the edges of the fast-response route will be maintained between 7-14 inches.
           1.4.2.1.2. The 5 AMXS and 54 HS building custodians will ensure compliance
           with mowing requirements outlined in this publication.
       1.4.2.2. Maintaining drainage ditches. Civil Engineering should regularly inspect
       ditches to keep them clear. Maintain ditch sides as steep as possible (minimum slope
       ratio of 5 to 1) and mow vegetation to discourage wading birds and emergent
       vegetation. Remove cattails and other water loving plants that are not easily cut to
       height (7 to 14 inches) due to saturated soil and the limits of mowing equipment.
       Improve drainage as necessary to inhibit temporary ponds or puddles and coordinate
       with 5 CES/CEAN to ensure no impact on wetlands.
MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                               5


       1.4.2.3. Controlling broadleaf plants. Keep broadleaf plants to a minimum on the
       airfield. Apply herbicides as necessary to achieve this and comply with AFI 32-1053,
       Pest Management Program. Broadleaf plants attract a variety of birds, may produce
       seeds or berries, and may limit grass growth. Obtain assistance in herbicide selection
       for broadleaf plant control, appropriate grass seed selection, fertilization, and erosion
       control vegetation from BASH team recommendations, U.S. Soil Conservation
       Service, or the Agricultural Extension Service.
       1.4.2.4. Planting bare areas. Eliminate bare areas on the airfield. Plant grass as
       required. Re-seed with the appropriate native grass to maintain ground cover and
       uniformity on the airfield.
       1.4.2.5. Fertilizing. Selectively stimulate grass growth to promote a uniform cover.
       Irrigation may be required to support turf growth.
       1.4.2.6. Removing dead vegetation. Remove dead vegetation such as brush piles,
       grass clippings, etc. This will effectively remove the cover it affords.
       1.4.2.7. Removing edge effect. Maintain the airfield as uniformly as possible to
       reduce the transition zone between two distinct habitat types (e.g., brush to
       grassland).
       1.4.2.8. Employing erosion control vegetation. Use vegetation that is appropriate for
       the region that does not go to seed at heights below 14 to 18 inches.
          1.4.2.8.1. Pest controls. Invertebrates and rodents are key food sources for many
          birds. Periodically survey and reduce these pests when required. Pesticides and
          traps can reduce pest populations. Ensure compliance with AFI 32-7086,
          Hazardous Materials Management, section 2.5. Only EPA approved pesticides
          are authorized, and must be used strictly according to label instructions (AFMAN
          32-1075). Use of these pesticides must be coordinated through and approved by
          the 5 CES Pest Management Shop. Use of these pesticides must be in strict
          accordance with their instructions IAW AFI 32-1053 and in conjunction with the
          approved EPA permits. Inspection and control should begin early in the spring
          after coordination is made with the animal control section of the Wildlife
          Management Plan.
       1.4.2.9. Eliminate roosting sites. Control blackbird and starling roosts by vegetation
       management of roost sites where possible. Prune trees to reduce the number of
       perches and remove entire tree stands if necessary. Refer to INRMP, AFI 32-7064.
       1.4.2.10. Hangars and Buildings. Facility Managers will bird-proof buildings and
       hangars as required to prohibit pigeons, sparrows, and swallows from nesting. Deny
       access by screening windows, closing doors, and blocking entry holes. Swallows will
       be controlled by aggressively removing all of their nests from buildings surrounding
       the flight line each spring. These nests will be removed regularly by the facility
       managers (daily if necessary) until the swallows choose a different roosting location.
       It is critical to remove the nests prior to their completion so the swallows choose to
       settle elsewhere to raise their young. Refer to UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport
       Planning and Design. Civil Engineering will advise facility managers when
       requested.
6                                                    MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


           1.4.2.11. Remove bird and animal carcasses from the airfield. In an effort to avoid
           attracting scavengers, remove carcasses as soon as they are discovered. Forward
           remains that may have been caused by collision with aircraft to Flight Safety (5
           BW/SEF) for identification.
           1.4.2.12. Leveling of airfield. Level or fill high or low spots to reduce attractiveness
           to wildlife and prevent standing water.
       1.4.3. Maintaining flight line fencing. Inspect the flight line perimeter fencing monthly
       for evidence of digging under the fences, holes in the fencing, or other means of wildlife
       penetration. Repair all discovered weaknesses immediately.
           1.4.3.1. Close perimeter gates. All personnel will ensure that all perimeter gates not
           located on major roadways will be closed at all times. Personnel passing through the
           gates are required to close the gates behind themselves before proceeding forward. If
           extended periods of opening are needed for a gate, a guard will be posted at the open
           gate until it is again closed and latched. Civil Engineering will ensure that all gates
           and latches are functional.
    1.5. Active BASH Risk Mitigation Measures. The following wildlife dispersal methods will
    be used concurrently with passive control measures to reduce the threat of wildlife strikes at
    Minot AFB. Although no single method will alleviate all threats, the collective use of the
    following techniques offers effective risk mitigation over time. AFPAM 91-212 notes that
    the “key to active wildlife dispersal is perseverance.” Agencies tasked within this instruction
    will actively pursue the following methods to ensure the highest success of the BASH
    program. Note: The Minot AFB Wildlife Biologist will be contacted prior to any shooting or
    trapping of terrestrial wildlife to ensure that the BASH effort is in compliance with the
    applicable state and federal regulations and permits for that animal.
       1.5.1. Mobile Observation and Harassment. Vehicles provide a means of both
       monitoring bird activity and denying airfield access to wildlife threats. The use of vehicle
       horns, flashing lights, bio-acoustics, and sirens offer temporary dispersal and requires
       continuous movement on the airfield. Use vehicles in conjunction with other active
       control methods to make the airfield unsuitable to avian threats and wildlife.
       1.5.2. Pyrotechnics. Pyrotechnics are noise producing devices fired from either a shotgun
       or a NJ-8 Very Pistol. The shotgun provides a greater range than the pistol. Both will be
       used in accordance with the following guidance:
           1.5.2.1. Shotgun.
               1.5.2.1.1. 5 BW/SEF. Flight safety will actively manage the use of the shotgun on
               the airfield. Trained by either CATM, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
               (USFWS), or State run Hunter Safety Course and then given Minot AFB specific
               training by 5 BW Flight Safety and USDA, authorized personnel will use
               shotguns to scare or depredate birds on or around the airfield. (See Section 1.5.5.
               for details concerning shotgun use on the airfield) Pyrotechnics for this weapon
               will be maintained by Airfield Management and tracked by members listed on the
               AF Form 68 Munitions Authorization Record. The Account Custodians will track
               and annotate weekly expenditures per explosive account requirements. Quarterly
               audits will be conducted IAW Air Force and Air Force Global Strike Command
MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                                7


            requirements.
     1.5.3. Bioacoustics. Bioacoustic devices offer bird dispersal through the use of species
     specific alarm or distress calls broadcast from vehicles on the airfield. If available, this
     system will be used in concert with other control methods.
        1.5.3.1. Application. Play the recordings in short intervals to prevent habituation by
        birds. Operate for 20-30 seconds, and then pause briefly. Repeat as required. Birds
        should respond by taking flight or becoming alert. These calls are most effective on
        ring-billed gulls. Pyrotechnics should be used in conjunction with bioacoustics, gas
        cannon, and/or depredation to enhance dispersal. Bioacoustics and pyrotechnics will
        be used on observed bird habitats or in response to requests from the
        Tower/Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
     1.5.4. Propane Gas Cannons. Propane gas cannons offer effective bird dispersal,
     especially when used at dawn or dusk. However, cannons must be relocated frequently to
     avoid habituation. These devices are effective on waterfowl, pheasants, and other game
     birds, and may also be used for gulls and blackbirds. Airfield Management will activate
     the cannons at their discretion or when directed by the SOF or 5 BW/SEF. Ensure 5
     SFS/Central Security Control (CSC) is advised prior to gas cannon operation. During
     periods of frequent use, the cannons will be relocated every 2 weeks. Ensure the propane
     tanks are full prior to each migration season.
     1.5.5. Depredation. Depredation provides a lethal alternative to mitigate bird hazards on
     the airfield. This section outlines the procedures, coordination efforts, and forms required
     to perform a safe and effective bird depredation program by the Minot AFB Depredation
     (MAD) Team on the Minot AFB airfield. Note: Depredation must occur in conjunction
     with other passive and active measures.
        1.5.5.1. General. The use of lethal force reinforces paired-response behavior,
        conditioning wildlife to avoid the airfield environment completely or react rapidly to
        government vehicles and operators accomplishing BASH measures.
        1.5.5.2. MAD Team Personnel. 5 BW/SEF, the Minot AFB Wildlife Biologist, 91
        MW/SE, Airfield Management, and other individuals identified by 5 BW/SEF as
        necessary for active depredation, are the only personnel authorized to depredate on
        the airfield and will be trained IAW requirements outlined in section 1.5.4.3. of this
        publication.
        1.5.5.3. Training. Personnel authorized to depredate will obtain or receive
        comprehensive training in the following areas:
            1.5.5.3.1. USAF Motor Vehicle License. Members will obtain a valid AF Form
            2293 prior to driving government vehicles.
            1.5.5.3.2. Flight Line Driving License. Members will obtain a flight light driving
            license prior to driving on the airfield IAW MAFBI 11-250.
            1.5.5.3.3. 5 BW/SEF Depredation Training. Members will be trained on firearm
            restrictions on the airfield, acceptable firing areas and directions, and any safety
            issues regarding employment of the firearms on Minot AFB, and proper handling
            of animal remains.
8                                                 MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


               1.5.5.3.3.1. In addition, all personnel employing firearms on Minot AFB in
               support of the BASH program will complete training as listed in 1.5.5.3.3.1.1
               or 1.5.5.3.3.1.2.
                 1.5.5.3.3.1.1. USAF Ground Weapons Training Certification (M-870).
                 Members will obtain training and qualify in the M-870 prior to using the
                 shotgun. Previously trained individuals will maintain currency and
                 accomplish additional training as required.
                 1.5.5.3.3.1.2. Hunter’s Safety Education Training. Members will
                 successfully complete a governmentally run hunter’s safety course prior to
                 depredating birds on the airfield. Members are required to produce the
                 documentation of completion of this training prior to engaging in wildlife
                 depredation on Minot AFB.
    1.5.5.4. Application. Due to the hazardous nature of depredating birds in an active
    airfield environment, coordination between base elements remains of paramount
    importance. This plan requires comprehensive inter-agency support and cooperation in
    order to effectively mitigate risks to personnel, aircraft, vehicles, and structures. Once it
    is determined that the bird condition warrants depredation, the following actions will be
    accomplished:
           1.5.5.4.1. Airfield Management. Airfield Management maintains the AF Form 68
           and 250 rounds of 5 BW/SEF or Minot AFB Wildlife Biologist-approved 12-
           gauge ammunition and 250 rounds of Shell Cracker/Shot Tell at Airfield
           Management.
               1.5.5.4.1.1. Personally owned firearms. All members utilizing personally
               owned firearms will abide by all applicable federal, state, and Minot AFB
               directives on the possession, transport, securing, and employment of firearms.
           1.5.5.4.2. Coordination. Prior to employing firearms on the flight line,
           Depredation Team members will notify Airfield Management of intent to
           depredate and estimated time when depredation activities will be complete.
           Airfield Management will then inform 5 SFS and command post of the impending
           depredation actions and estimated time of completion. Note: If depredation
           actions will continue past the estimated time of completion, members will notify
           Airfield Management of the new estimated time of completion. Airfield
           Management will then inform 5 SFS and command post of the new time.
           1.5.5.4.3. Communication. Depredation Team members will maintain positive
           two-way communication with the Tower at all times. If directed by Tower to
           depart the active runway environment, members will immediately respond to the
           call, do a “quick” inventory of equipment, and exit the active runway.
           1.5.5.4.4. Approved lines of fire. Approved lines of fire include from the infield,
           south across the runway. Individuals will not fire towards Taxiway Echo or the
           buildings on the infield. Firearms will not be fired in the direction of the Tower,
           taxiing aircraft, vehicles, structures, or any other background that can hold
           personnel or property. See Attachment 3 to this publication for firing zones and
           restricted areas. Be observant for vehicles or aircraft in immediate line of fire and
MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                              9


          immediately cease fire for any encroachment. The area of operations is defined
          within the confines of the airfield, not closer than 200 yards of any building, road,
          other vehicle or aircraft, and outside all security areas. 5 BW/SEF personnel may
          depredate at any location on the airfield when necessary for safety of flight.
          1.5.5.4.5. Depredating members will stay in contact with all shooters at all times
          and ensure safe lines of fire are maintained.
       1.5.5.5. Individuals employing depredation will adhere to this instruction and
       MAFBI 11-250 guidance at all times. All expended shells will be maintained for
       inventory upon completion of depredation. Return all expended shells to comply
       with explosive account requirements and limit Foreign Object Debris (FOD) on the
       airfield. During periods when not actively depredating, the shotgun(s) will be
       returned an approved (by 5 BW/SEF) and closed gun case.
       1.5.5.6. All animal remains will be properly handled and surrendered to 5 BW/SEF
       for disposal.
       1.5.5.7. Additional Rules of Engagement. The following will be accomplished to
       ensure the safe use of depredation in BASH control measures:
          1.5.5.7.1. Only shot approved by 5 BW/SEF or the Minot AFB Wildlife Biologist
          will be used.
          1.5.5.7.2. 5 BW/SEF and Airfield Management will ensure their respective
          storage of ammunition and firearms are accomplished IAW this instruction, DoD
          5100.76-M, AFI 31-101, AFI 31-101 AFGSC Supplement, and MAFBI 31-101.
          1.5.5.7.3. A letter of qualified shooters and training documentation will be
          maintained by         5 BW/SEF, Airfield Management, and 91 MW/SE, for their
          respective members of the Depredation Team. The qualified shooter list will be
          reviewed annually.
          1.5.5.7.4. Patrol members will cease firing NLT 10 minutes prior to aircraft
          movement on the runway to avoid scaring birds into the flight path of departing or
          arriving aircraft to include UH-1Ns. They will carry and reference a current B-52
          flight schedule, scheduled UH-1 flight summary, and transient aircraft schedule.
          1.5.5.7.5. Weapons and munitions storage at Airfield Management will be
          accomplished with an authorization letter from the 5 OSS/CC with coordination
          through 5 BW/SE. The 5 OSS commander will endorse the letter and forward it to
          the Airfield Management. A copy will be maintained at Airfield Management.
       1.5.5.8. Government Policy and Regulations. In order to be in compliance with
       governing directives, the following will be accomplished:
          1.5.5.8.1. The 5 BW Wildlife Biologist (or 5 CES/CEAN and 5 BW/SEF, in
          absence of a Wildlife Biologist) will maintain, and be ready to produce, current
          depredation permits with all applicable agencies at all times. Only the species
          annotated on the permit will be taken. However, “Emergency Take”, is
          authorized on all non-threatened and non-endangered species if a significant
          potential or active danger to aircraft is imminent. All “Emergency Take” actions
          will be reported to the permit maintainer and properly reported according to
10                                        MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


     permit guidelines. “Emergency Take” guidelines will be included as part of
     MAD Team training.
     1.5.5.8.2. Take numbers authorized by permit from the United States Fish and
     Wildlife Service (USFWS) will not be exceeded without prior approval. POC is
     the current depredation permit holder. A record of the number of birds taken,
     including species, must be maintained by            5 BW/SEF. Use Attachment 4
     to this publication. Carcasses of birds must be disposed of immediately. Current
     permits prevent keeping of bird carcasses for any reason.
     1.5.5.8.3. The following describe changes in USFWS policy on the taking of
     migratory birds.
        1.5.5.8.3.1. Air Force installations must have a depredation permit issued by
        the USFWS prior to any take of migratory birds necessary for health or safety
        reasons, including BASH program implementation.
        1.5.5.8.3.2. Federal agencies are still bound by the Endangered Species Act
        (ESA). Consult with the USFWS informally to ensure take operations are
        handled in accordance with the ESA.
        1.5.5.8.3.3. Installations must comply with migratory bird treaties entered
        into between the U.S. and other nations. Guidance or clarification can be
        attained through the 5 BW Wildlife Biologist and/or 5 CES Environmental
        office.
        1.5.5.8.3.4. Federal contractors and volunteers are not exempt from the
        mandates of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
        1.5.5.8.3.5. Although federal agencies are normally not bound by state laws
        pertaining to migratory birds, AFI 32-7064, para. 7.1.1 directs installations to
        protect state-listed endangered, threatened, or rare species when practical.
        Minot AFB will coordinate proposed takes with the North Dakota Game and
        Fish department and/or other stakeholders and be sensitive to the state's
        concerns.
        1.5.5.8.3.6. Any proposal to take, or otherwise impact, migratory bird species
        is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 USC 4321-
        4347) and AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)
        (32 CFR 989). For emergency situations, MAJCOMs and installations will
        follow the procedures outlined in AFI 32-7061, Section 4.8.2, Emergency
        Procedures.
        1.5.5.8.3.7. When the decision has been made to depredate, installations shall
        prepare an administrative record to document the "take."
        1.5.5.8.3.8. Each Air Force installation located in the U.S. or its territories
        will:
          1.5.5.8.3.8.1. Apply for a depredation permit from the USFWS
          1.5.5.8.3.8.2. Apply for any required state permits.
          1.5.5.8.3.8.3. Consult with the USFWS informally on issues of bird
MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                             11


                  conservation.
                  1.5.5.8.3.8.4. Retain records of take (or any other activity) of species
                  regulated under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Bald & Golden Eagle
                  Protection Act.
     1.5.6. Radio Controlled Aircraft. Remote controlled (RC) aircraft provide a continual
     method of harassment for airborne threats. Their use is most effective against gull
     populations on and around the airfield. When flown by a skilled operator, RC aircraft will
     disperse avian threats. The following procedures identify standard operating procedures
     and required airfield coordination requirements.
        1.5.6.1. Personnel. Only qualified volunteers will conduct RC operations on the
        airfield. Completion of all training requirements will be monitored by 5 BW/SEF.
        1.5.6.2. Equipment. When reporting to the airfield, qualified members will proceed
        with the following equipment:
            1.5.6.2.1. PPE.
                1.5.6.2.1.1. Hearing Protection.
                1.5.6.2.1.2. Leather Gloves.
            1.5.6.2.2. LMR.
            1.5.6.2.3. Vehicle with two-way radio.
            1.5.6.2.4. RC Aircraft.
            1.5.6.2.5. RC Aircraft Launch/Recovery Kit.
        1.5.6.3. 5 BW/SEF will determine the need for RC aircraft commensurate with the
        level of bird activity on the airfield and congestion of actual aircraft in the local
        traffic pattern. Planned RC aircraft flight periods will be published in the weekly 5
        OG flight schedule to the maximum extent possible. When notified of RC aircraft
        operations qualified individuals will proceed to           5 BW/SEF for equipment
        inventory and checkout. A log will be used to record equipment taken to the airfield,
        individuals flying the RC, and sign in/out times. This documentation will aid FOD
        prevention and location of personnel and equipment. Upon completion of initial
        checkout,         5 OSS/A-3A will notify all applicable agencies prior to the RC team
        proceeding to the airfield. The RC team will depart with all required equipment listed
        at 1.5.5.2 and a copy of the local flying schedule. The RC team will contact Tower for
        access onto the active runway using both the vehicle’s two-way radio and the LMR.
        Once established on the airfield, the RC team will comply with the following:
            1.5.6.3.1. Communication. Two people are required to operate the RC aircraft, a
            qualified person to actively fly and the other to act as a safety observer and
            maintain contact with the Tower on the ramp net. If personnel leave the vehicle,
            they must be in contact with the Tower using an LMR. Note: In the case of lost
            communication with the Tower, immediately terminate use of the RC aircraft and
            exit the airfield environment.
                1.5.6.3.1.1. Before using the RC aircraft, contact the SOF, Tower, Airfield
12                                         MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


        Management, and 54 HS duty officer at 723-6352/6353 by cell phone to
        ensure no full-scale aircraft are in the pattern or are expected to take off/land
        while using RC aircraft.
        1.5.6.3.1.2. Confirm that the Minot AFB Tower added the appropriate
        information to ATIS.
        1.5.6.3.1.3. Contact the LMR shop at 3-2412 in order to track any
        interference created by RC aircraft. RC aircraft are FCC Part 15 devices and
        may interrupt LMR communications.
        1.5.6.3.1.4. When RC flying is complete notify the Tower and state “off of
        the active runway environment”. Note: If RC aircraft operations are being
        conducted and Tower receives notification that an aircraft is on final to land,
        tower will immediately contact the RC team and instruct them to clear the
        runway. If an emergency situation develops that prevents the RC team from
        an expeditious recovery of the aircraft, the RC operator will crash land or
        ditch the aircraft on the infield near the Tower.
     1.5.6.3.2. The RC aircraft will not be operated on the airfield outside of operating
     hours established by Airfield Management.
     1.5.6.3.3. Restrictions. In the interest of safety and security, the following
     guidelines will be strictly adhered to:
        1.5.6.3.3.1. RC flying will not be accomplished by anyone except those who
        have successfully passed the 5 BW Flight Safety RC training program.
        1.5.6.3.3.2. RC flights will only occur during daylight hours.
        1.5.6.3.3.3. RC aircraft operations will not take place during inclement
        weather. Prevailing ceiling and visibility must be greater than 400 feet and 1
        mile (400-1). Contact 5 OSS/OSW at 723-6385/6386 for local weather
        conditions.
        1.5.6.3.3.4. RC aircraft operation will not take place when sustained winds
        exceed 20 knots.
        1.5.6.3.3.5. No RC flying will be accomplished unless radio contact is
        established and maintained with the Tower.
        1.5.6.3.3.6. RC flying will not take place when full-scale airborne aircraft are
        within 5 miles of the airfield. Exception: When a full-scale aircraft is waiting
        to land due to BWC SEVERE, RC flights may be accomplished but require 5
        OG approval.
        1.5.6.3.3.7. No RC flying will take place within 500 feet of any non-RC
        aircraft.
        1.5.6.3.3.8. No RC flying will take place within 300 feet of the WSA, MPA,
        APA, Missile Turn-Around Pad, or any structure on the airfield. This distance
        is measured horizontally.
        1.5.6.3.3.9. Do not over fly taxiing or parked aircraft, vehicles, or personnel.
MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 13


                 1.5.6.3.3.10. The RC aircraft must be flown close enough to the operator to
                 ensure safe operation and recovery. At Tower’s request, the RC team will land
                 the RC aircraft and depart the active runway or airfield environment.

            2.1.3.1.1.6. Comprehensive measures provide necessary information about
            bird migration, patterns of flight, concentrations and methods for identifying
            new bird threats to all aviators in area, not just those operating out of Minot
            AFB.
        2.1.3.1.2. Regional interest. More outlying communities may want information
        about activity as bird migration may move through their “neighborhood.” Markets
        include the Bismarck Tribune, Prairie Public Radio and Television, as well as
        newspapers that serve the area outside coverage of the local Minot press. Key
        messages to them include those above for local interest besides:
            2.1.3.1.2.1. Basic flight safeguards of base aircraft.
            2.1.3.1.2.2. System alerts and distribution.
            2.1.3.1.2.3. Concern for environmental impact of operations and impact on

3. Reports and Forms.
   3.1. General. Report all bird and/or wildlife strikes IAW AFPAM 91-212 and AFI 91-204.
   Successful completion enhances the BASH program at Minot AFB and enables adequate
   tracking of BASH hazards. 5 BW/SEF will provide AF Form 853s to all flying units, Airfield
   Management, and maintenance debrief as required.
   3.2. Bird/Wildlife Strike Reporting. In the case of a bird or wildlife strikes, tasked units will
   accomplish the following:
      3.2.1. All bird or wildlife strikes on aircraft landing at Minot AFB, whether damage
      occurred or not, will be reported to the MOC via normal maintenance channels. The
      aircrew and/or maintenance personnel will complete an AF Form 853 (Air Force Bird
      Strike Report), available on the web publications page, detailing the bird or wildlife
      strike. The MOC will notify              5 BW/CP and 5 BW/SE in accordance with the
      MOC notification checklist. A copy of the completed Form 853 will be faxed by the
      MOC to 5 BW/SEF.
      3.2.2. Aircrews involved in bird/wildlife strikes will fill out an AF Form 853 and provide
      a detailed account concerning the incident. Forms will be available in flight binders and
      at maintenance debrief. Submit the completed form with mission paperwork.
      Maintenance debrief will fax the completed report to 5 BW/SEF.
      3.2.3. Maintenance personnel discovering a bird strike will notify the MOC, who will in
      turn notify the on-duty FOD/DOP Manager or designated representative from Quality
      Assurance (QA). The FOD/DOP Manager or designated representative from QA will
      insure that the AF Form 853 is completed and faxed to 5 BW/SEF for all bird strikes. If
      aircraft damage is suspected or evident, MOC will notify 5 BW/SEF and a safety
      professional will be dispatched to retrieve samples and investigate BASH evidence.
      Impound the aircraft if deemed necessary by Air Force Instruction 21-101 and Minot
      AFB 21-201 Supp. 1.
      3.2.4. Airfield Management personnel will contact 5 BW/SEF in the event that bird
      remains are discovered on the airfield. An AF Form 853 will be accomplished if evidence
      suggests that bird remains were caused by impact with an aircraft. Follow guidance
      outlined in section 3.3. of this publication and then contact Minot AFB civil engineering
      for removal and disposal of remains. Airfield Management will assist transient aircrews
      in completing the AF Form 853 and will obtain unit/organization information when
      damage occurs. Fax the completed report to 5 BW/SEF.
      3.2.5. 5 BW/SEF will compile all reported bird strike data for the 5 BW and input the
      information into the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS). 91 MW/SEF will
      accomplish the same for 54 HS bird strikes.
 24                                                 MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


      3.2.6. Bird strike damage meeting AFI 91-204 Class A, B, or C requirements will be
      reported by 5 BW/SEF or 91 MW/SEF immediately.
      3.2.7. Bird strike damage meeting AFI 10-206 requirements will be reported by 5
      BW/CP.
   3.3. Bird Remains Identification:
      3.3.1. Individuals discovering bird remains will place non-fleshy bird parts (feathers,
      beaks, or feet) in a plastic bag and forward to 5 BW/SEF or 91MW/SEF (as appropriate)
      with a copy of the completed AF Form 853. Blood smears collected on a paper towel and
      small pieces of a feather may also be used for identification. Even the smallest fragment
      of a feather should be collected and saved. Only individuals familiar with the Air Force
      Safety Center guidance on retrieving remains (for example, in QA or 5 BW/SEF) will
      collect the samples of bird and/or wildlife remains.
      3.3.2. 5 BW/SEF or 91 MW/SEF will forward remains to the Smithsonian Institution
      IAW AFMAN 91-223.
4. 5 BW Flying Operations.
   4.1. General. This section outlines rules concerning all 5 BW aircraft. Note: 91 MW
   operators please refer to Section 5 of this publication for guidance.
      4.1.1. It is critical to immediately exchange information between ground agencies and
      aircrews concerning the existence and location of birds that pose a hazard to flight safety.
      A cautionary advisory will be published in the DoD Flight Information Publication AP/1
      under the Supplementary Airdrome Remarks highlighting the bird hazard and their
      heaviest concentrations during April-May and August-November.
   4.2. BWC Codes. Per AFI 11-418, MAFBSUP, the following terminology has been
   established for rapid communication of bird activity. Bird locations should be given with the
   condition code. These codes are standard and other terminology is not authorized.
      4.2.1. Condition SEVERE. Heavy concentration of birds on or immediately above the
      active runway or other specific location that represents an immediate hazard to safe
      flying operation. Supervisors and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission needs
      before conducting operations in areas under condition SEVERE.
      4.2.2. Condition MODERATE. Bird activity near the active runway that presents an
      increased potential for strikes. Further OG/CC clarification defines MODERATE as
      “Concentration of birds observable in locations which represent a probable hazard to safe
      flying operations.” BWC MODERATE requires increased vigilance by all agencies and
      supervisors, and extreme caution by aircrews.
      4.2.3. Condition LOW. Normal bird activity on or above the airfield with a low
      probability of hazard.
   4.3. Declaring Bird Watch Conditions.
      4.3.1. The following personnel comprise the BWC team and are authorized to
      upgrade/downgrade the bird watch condition. Notification will be IAW Section 4.6. of
      this publication. 5 OG/CC and SOF (primary), 5 OSS/OSAA (Airfield Management) and
      5 BW/SEF (secondary)
MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 25


     4.3.2. When both members of the team are on the flight line, the final decision to
     upgrade/downgrade the BWC will be made by the highest authority as rank-ordered
     above. However, before changing the BWC, information from other team members,
     Flight Safety, pilot reports, and Tower will be considered.
     4.3.3. When Tower observes high numbers of birds either visually or on radar, they will
     inform the SOF or Airfield Management using radio or telephonic communications.
     Tower will advise the BWC team about raising/lowering the bird watch condition.
     4.3.4. Positioning. The following procedures will be used during 5 BW and/or 91 MW
     aircraft launches or airborne aircraft recoveries into Minot AFB. When under condition
     SEVERE or when deemed necessary by the SOF or Airfield Management, the following
     personnel will assume the following positions on the airfield: SOF: Maintain oversight
     from the Tower, 5 OSS/OSAA: Spread out as necessary on or near the active runway, 5
     BW/SEF: Spread out as necessary on or near the active runway
         4.3.4.1. If all players are not available on the airfield, or the SOF is in the Tower, the
         remaining personnel will position themselves based on the situation to best monitor
         and/or disperse the bird activity. If persistent bird activity exists on the airfield, all
         players will coordinate efforts listed in section 1.5. of this publication to reduce the
         threat.
     4.3.5. Airfield Management will raise/lower the BWC based on observations and inputs
     from Tower, and 5 BW/SEF in the absence of the SOF.
     4.3.6. During heightened BWCs, active bird control efforts will be employed to reduce
     the threat. The use of these measures will be implemented IAW section 1.5. of this
     publication. Continue efforts until the BWC is returned to LOW, darkness precludes
     effective bird harassment, or all aircraft are recovered.
     4.3.7. When bird activity increases and the potential for BWC MODERATE or SEVERE
     exists, the SOF or Airfield Management will notify 5 BW/SEF, who will then respond to
     the airfield as the situation and manning warrants.
  4.4. Updating the BWC. Once a BWC has been raised above LOW, it is the declaring
  authority’s responsibility to update the condition. Obtain updated information and reassess
  the bird condition every 15 minutes until the BWC returns to LOW during periods of aircraft
  activity or one hour prior to takeoffs and landings. The condition can remain the same, be
  upgraded, or downgraded as necessary. If able, Tower, maintenance personnel, and aircrews
  will provide bird updates to the SOF or Airfield Management based on observations. The
  SOF must update Airfield Management when changes to the BWC occur.
     4.4.1. The SOF will update the BWC during B-52 operations. At the termination of
     launches or recovers, the SOF will advise Airfield Management that they are departing
     the airfield, identify the BWC, and indicate the next time a SOF will be on the airfield.
     4.4.2. Airfield Management will update the BWC during normal airfield operating hours
     in the absence of the SOF. If the BWC remains above LOW after the departure of the
     SOF, Airfield Management will monitor the airfield and adjust the BWC as the situation
     demands. During periods of sustained BWC MODERATE, Airfield Management will
     ensure personnel assess the BWC one hour prior to aircraft activity and every 15 minutes
26                                                MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


     following that time until the BWC drops to LOW or aircraft either land or depart the
     airfield. Note: The 54 HS accepts responsibility for flying operations during BWC
     MODERATE and does not require 15 minute BWC updates for Airfield Management.
     However, if the BWC reaches SEVERE or the 54 HS requests assistance, Airfield
     Management will respond to the airfield to mitigate risk.
  4.5. Flight Restrictions. The following restrictions have been given by the 5 OG/CC to all B-
  52H pilots based on location and condition. Airborne crews may coordinate with Tower to
  enter holding during conditions MODERATE or SEVERE while waiting for the condition to
  return to LOW in order to conduct transition training. However, crews MUST hold at an
  altitude above bird concentrations. Note: The 54 HS/DO is the authority to restrict air
  operations for the 91 MW helicopters. Note: The restrictions associated with each condition
  do not preclude the aircraft commander’s emergency authority to land if fuel status or other
  emergencies pose a greater risk.
     4.5.1. Condition SEVERE:
         4.5.1.1. Traffic Pattern. 5 OG/CC approval is required for all takeoffs and landings.
         Transition training is not allowed. Operational Risk Management must be considered
         when approving takeoffs and landings during condition Severe. The 5 OG/CC may
         consider changing runways, delaying takeoffs and landings, diverting aircraft, etc.
         4.5.1.2. Low-Level Routes and Training Areas. Avoid specified areas and altitudes.
     4.5.2. Condition MODERATE:
         4.5.2.1. Traffic Pattern. Takeoffs and full stop landings are allowed. Transition
         training requires 5 OG/CC approval and will be kept to the minimum required for
         mission accomplishment.
         4.5.2.2. Low-Level Routes and Training Areas. Change flight profile or altitudes to
         minimize bird hazards.
     4.5.3. Condition LOW: Conduct mission requirements as normal. Normal bird activity
     on or around the airfield presents a low hazard probability.
  4.6. Communications. Disseminate BWCs by the following means:
     4.6.1. Declaring authority will notify Airfield Management when changing BWC.
     Airfield Management will contact all associated agencies and run the appropriate QRC.
     4.6.2. Include BWCs other than LOW in the hourly ATIS information. Airfield
     Management personnel will notify 5 BW/CP, Minot AFB Tower, and aircrews stepping
     to fly of BWC MODERATE or SEVERE.
     4.6.3. The Tower is the primary agency for transmitting BWCs to airborne aircraft or
     aircraft awaiting takeoff clearance.
     4.6.4. Under BWC SEVERE, Minot Tower will issue the advisory, "Minot is bird watch
     condition severe, birds on/near the runway (as appropriate)” IAW FAA Handbook
     7110.65.
  4.7. Aircrew Responsibilities and Procedures: Aircrews that observe or encounter any bird
  activity while in flight which constitutes a hazard will contact the Tower, SOF, or 5 BW/CP
MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   27


   for relay to SOF or Airfield Management as appropriate. The following information will be
   included:
      4.7.1. Call Sign.
      4.7.2. Location.
      4.7.3. Altitude.
      4.7.4. Time of Sighting.
      4.7.5. Type of bird (if known).
      4.7.6. Approximate number of birds.
      4.7.7. Behavior of birds (soaring, migrating, loafing on runway, etc.).
   4.8. Procedure for maintenance personnel, Tower, and 5 BW/CP. If a bird activity report is
   received, notify the SOF (or Airfield Management if the SOF is not on the airfield).
5. 91 MW Flying Operations.
   5.1. General. This section outlines rules concerning all 91 MW aircraft. It is applicable to the
   unique flight regimes and capabilities of helicopters. Note: 5 BW operators please refer to
   Section 4 of this publication for guidance.
   5.2. Authority. Tower will notify 54 HS/SOF via Helicopter Ops Desk when bird conditions
   change during helicopter flight operations. Implementation of helicopter operational
   restrictions due to hazardous bird conditions will be made by the Commander, DO, or 54
   HS/SOF as the situation dictates. Aircrews in flight will be informed of the current bird
   condition and will adhere to the following guidance. However, this document does not
   substitute pilot judgment, as situations may warrant more immediate action to safely recover
   both crew and aircraft.
   5.3. Guidance. The 54 HS/DO or his designated representative or higher will apply
   operational restrictions to local flying operations that are tailored to observed bird activities.
   In many situations informing aircrews that increased bird activity exists will be sufficient
   action. However, some situations will require more positive actions to reduce the potential
   for a bird strike. Although restrictions will vary with the type and location of bird activity,
   the following minimum restrictions should be complied with:
      5.3.1. Condition SEVERE:
          5.3.1.1. Traffic Pattern. Helicopter flight crews will avoid the vicinity of bird activity
          and make a full stop landing or depart the traffic pattern. Restricting authority and
          crews should consider delaying departures and arrivals or diverting aircraft.
          5.3.1.2. Low Levels. Specific areas and altitudes should be specified and avoided.
          (EXAMPLE: Alpha Flight area below 1,000’ – avoid). Choose alternate route if
          available.
          5.3.1.3. Night. Night operations should be suspended. Aircraft in the local pattern
          should accomplish one landing to a full stop. Aircraft in flight, but not in the local
          pattern, should be delayed or diverted until the SEVERE condition is downgraded, if
          practicable.
28                                                  MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


     5.3.2. Condition MODERATE:
         5.3.2.1. Traffic Pattern. Helicopter flight crews will avoid the vicinity of bird activity
         and adjust or minimize traffic patterns to mitigate risk.
         5.3.2.2. Low Levels. Fly at altitudes necessary to minimize bird hazards.
         5.3.2.3. Night. Helicopter flight crews will use night vision goggles to avoid the
         vicinity of bird activity and will fly at altitudes and airspeeds to minimize bird
         hazards.
     5.3.3. Operators flying in the uncontrolled environment following airfield closure will
     not have bird hazard abatement support. Caution will be used to mitigate the risks
     associated with avian threats.
  5.4. Communication. The BWC will be disseminated by any combination of the following
  means:
     5.4.1. BWCs exceeding LOW will be posted at the operations desk.
     5.4.2. 54 HS/SOF will brief aircrews during SOF briefing as appropriate.
     5.4.3. 54 HS/SOF will inform airborne aircraft via radio.
     5.4.4. Airborne aircraft will report hazardous bird activity via radio to the 54 HS/SOF
     and other airborne aircraft.
  5.5. Reporting. The following reporting procedures will be used for reporting hazardous bird
  activity and actual bird strikes:
     5.5.1. Reports of hazardous bird activity will be passed from the 54 HS/SOF to the
     Tower via the Helicopter Ops Desk.
     5.5.2. Helicopter contract maintenance will report observed hazardous bird activity to the
     54 HS/SOF.
     5.5.3. Aircrews and 54 HS/SOF will report bird strikes in accordance with the Bird
     Strike Quick Reaction Checklist at the 54 HS/SOF desk.
     5.5.4. Maintenance will report previously undetected bird strikes to the 54 HS/SOF.
     5.5.5. After duty hours, maintenance will collect non-fleshy bird strike evidence using
     the collection bags in the aircraft “nav kit” and notify the 54 HS/SOF the next duty day if
     there is no aircraft damage. Maintenance will report bird strikes resulting in aircraft
     damage to the 54 HS Commander or DO immediately, and comply with the
     aforementioned evidence collection procedures.
  5.6. Transient Crews. Transient helicopter aircrews flying in support of, or in conjunction
  with, the 54 HS will comply with the criteria outlined in this publication.
  5.7. 91 MW/SEF and 54 HS/SEF BASH Responsibilities. 54 HS/SEF will inform crews of
  hazardous migratory bird areas and times based upon current BAM models and aircrew
  inputs. Additionally, he or she will ensure copies of all AF Forms 853 and bird remains are
  promptly forwarded to 91 MW/SEF for bird strike tracking. 91 MW/SEF will forward the AF
  Forms 853 and bird remains IAW Annex D. Aircraft damage will be reported IAW AFI 91-
  204.

                                     MAPS AND CHARTS

A2.1. General. This attachment outlines the requirements for the maps and charts required to
implement the BASH program. These requirements address the following maps and charts:
    A2.1.1. Base habitat map.
    A2.1.2. Surrounding area map.
    A2.1.3. Low-level route/training area range maps.
A2.2. Minot AFB Habitat Map: (OPR: MAFB Wildlife Biologist)
    A2.2.1. Conduct a survey, as required, to identify major habitat types available to birds.
    Construct a map based on this survey.
    A2.2.2. When a specific hazard is identified and the location of the activity is isolated, use
    the habitat map to determine if a specific attractant exists which can be altered within the
    scope of
this plan.
    A2.2.3. Use the map for long-range civil engineering programs to reduce actual and
    potential hazardous environmental factors on Minot AFB.
    A2.2.4. Provide copies to 5 BW/SEF, 91 MW/SEF, Airfield Management, 23/69 BS/SEF,
    and 54 HS/SEF upon request.
A2.3. Minot AFB Surrounding Area Map: (OPR: 5 CES/CEPT)
    A2.3.1. Construct a map of the surrounding area using the Habitat Map guidance listed
    above.
    A2.3.2. Use this map to identify specific hazards such as wildlife refuges, wetlands, lakes,
    landfills, etc., to avoid over flight. Modify hazards through negotiation with the local
    community when possible.
    A2.3.3. Provide copies to 5 BW/SEF, 91 MW/SEF, Airfield Management, 23/69 BS/SEF,
    and 54 HS/SEF upon request.
A2.4. Low-Level Route/Training Area/Range Maps: (OPR: 5 OSS/A-2T) Maintain maps
depicting all low-level routes/ranges/areas used by 5 BW aircraft. Annotate wildlife refuges on
the charts.
A2.5. Low-Level Route/Training Area/Range BASH Charts: (OPR: 23 BS/FSO)
    A2.5.1. The USAF Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) is available on the web at
 34                                                 MINOTAFBI91-212 10 OCTOBER 2013


http://www.usahas.com/bam/. Low-level routes, along with military and civilian airfield data,
will be available by request.
   A2.5.2. The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) provides bird strike risk information
   from observations made by the NEXRAD weather radar system. Weather radar data is
   processed by the AHAS system to detect birds in “near” real time. This information is on the
   web at http://www.usahas.com/.
   A2.5.3. Use data to recommend changes in the use of routes/areas during periods of peak
   bird activity.
   A2.5.4. 23/69 BS/FSO and the Flight Commander of the Day will insure current BASH
   charts are included and updated on the Virtual Base Operations briefing (located at the
   23rd/69th Bomb Squadron Step Desk).
