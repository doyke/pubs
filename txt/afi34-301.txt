                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Legal Status of NAF Civilian Employees. NAF employees are Federal employees within
the Department of Defense (DoD) but are not subject to the same personnel laws administered by
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for APF employees. Title 5 United States Code
§2105(c) explains this NAF employee status and identifies the OPM-administered laws that
cover NAF employees unless otherwise specifically stated in law.
1.2. Types of Appointments. NAF employees can obtain two types of appointments: Regular
or Flexible.
     1.2.1. Employees may obtain either type of appointment on a limited-term basis.
     1.2.2. The Air Force guarantees regular employees 20 to 40 hours per week.
     1.2.3. The needs of the activity determine flexible employees' work hours.
        1.2.3.1. Although the Air Force doesn't guarantee flexible employees will work every
        week, they may work up to 40 hours per week.
     1.2.4. Activities post a work schedule for all employees.
1.3. Quality Assessment. The Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and installation
commanders assess the NAF personnel program in accordance with AFMAN 34-312.

           PREPARING AND MAINTAINING NAF PERSONNEL RECORDS

2.1. Responsibilities.
   2.1.1. Force Support Squadron (FSS) NAF-Human Resources (HR) Section. The NAF-HR
   Section maintains central custody of all Standard Forms (SF) 66, Official Personnel Folder
   (OPF), SF 66-C, Merged Records Personnel Folder (MRPF), and SF 66-D, Employee
   Medical Folder (EMF).
       2.1.1.1. The NAF-HR Section prepares, maintains, safeguards, and disposes of all
       records and forms it uses for personnel administration IAW DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-
       302, Freedom of Information Act Program, AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program, and
       AFRIMS.
       2.1.1.2. NAF-HR Sections use the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) to
       establish and maintain employee and position data, and to process Air Force Form 2548,
       NAFI Request for Personnel Action. This data system is operated at all levels of the Air
       Force.
   2.1.2. Managers and Supervisors of NAF Employees.           Supervisors comply with this
   instruction by:
       2.1.2.1. Initiating personnel actions.
       2.1.2.2. Maintaining records on their employees.
2.2. Official Personnel Folder (OPF). The OPF contains records which accurately show an
employee's most essential information from date of employment to date of separation. NAF-HR
Sections:
   2.2.1. Prepare and maintain an OPF (SF 66) for each employee.
   2.2.2. File documents in an employee's OPF according to long-term or temporary retention.
   2.2.3. File long-term documents on the right side of the OPF and temporary documents on
   the left side of the OPF.
2.3. Employee Medical Folder (EMF). The EMF (SF 66-D) contains occupational-related
civilian employee medical records covering an individual's NAF employment. While medical
facilities under the control of a medical officer retain medical records on civilian employees,
NAF-HR Sections create and maintain the EMF for any records the medical facility doesn't
maintain.
2.4. Merged Records Personnel Folder (MRPF). The MRPF (SF 66-C) contains the
personnel records of employees moving between NAF and civil service who receive benefits
under the Public Law 101-508 §7202, Portability of Benefits for Nonappropriated Fund
Employees Act of 1990. Once the NAF-HR Section establishes an MRPF for an employee, it is
used to retain:
   2.4.1. The employee's records in all later NAF and civil service employment.
   2.4.2. Records from an employee's work in another employment system.
 8                                                                     AFI34-301 16 APRIL 2013


2.5. Disposition of Personnel Records and Folders. NAF-HR Sections dispose of personnel
records and folders in accordance with AFRIMS.
2.6. Other Personnel Records and Forms. NAF-HR Sections do not set up any other
personnel records and forms other than those required by this instruction.
2.7. Supervisor’s Records. Supervisors maintain an employee work folder for all employees to
document significant events and discussions concerning employee performance, recognition, and
conduct.
     2.7.1. Supervisors at higher levels do not keep duplicate sets of records.
     2.7.2. Title 5 USC §552a, Privacy Act of 1974, applies to the employee work folder, so
     supervisors must protect it from unauthorized access at all times.
2.8. Releasing Information From Personnel Folders. The Privacy Act:
     2.8.1. Gives employees the right to:
        2.8.1.1. Know what personnel records the Air Force collects, maintains, and distributes.
        2.8.1.2. Correct and amend their personnel records.
     2.8.2. Requires Air Force officials comply with DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302 and AFI
     33-332 when:
        2.8.2.1. Releasing information and documents in employee's personnel folders.
        2.8.2.2. Amending or correcting those records.
        2.8.2.3. Setting fees for providing records.

permit a “spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin” to take up to 26 workweeks of leave to
care for a “member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserve,
who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status,
or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness.” It also
permits an employee to take FMLA leave for “any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that

of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency
operation.”

                                          Chapter 11

                                 POSITION CLASSIFICATION

11.1. Systems for Classifying and Paying Positions. NAF positions are classified into one of
three major pay-setting systems:
   11.1.1. Prevailing rate positions consisting of CT positions.
   11.1.2. NAF pay band positions.
   11.1.3. Child development and youth positions.
11.2. NAF CT (NA, NL, and NS) Pay System. The CT pay system includes positions in a
recognized craft or trade.
   11.2.1. It incorporates three pay schedules:
       11.2.1.1. NA and NL, which each consist of 15 grades with five steps in each grade.
       11.2.1.2. NS, which consists of 19 grades with five steps in each grade.
   11.2.2. New employees normally start at step one and progress through the five steps at
   predetermined intervals.
11.3. NAF Pay Band (NF) System.
   11.3.1. The NF pay band system includes these positions:
       11.3.1.1. Clerical.
       11.3.1.2. Administrative.
       11.3.1.3. Retail.
       11.3.1.4. Recreational.
       11.3.1.5. Managerial.
       11.3.1.6. Executive.
       11.3.1.7. Technical.
       11.3.1.8. Professional.
   11.3.2. The NAF pay band system includes six pay bands (NF-I through NF-VI), each with a
   minimum and maximum hourly rate.
11.4. Child and Youth (CY) Pay System Program. The CY pay system covers child and
youth positions within the Child Development and Youth Programs Centers.
   11.4.1. This system includes two pay bands, each with a minimum and maximum hourly

11.5. Standardized Position Descriptions (SPDs) and Position Guides (SPGs). NAF-HR
Sections and supervisors use Air Force SPDs and SPGs when establishing new, revising or
filling NAF civilian positions. They are designed to aid installation-level Chief, Human
Resources and managers by reducing the time spent in local development and classification.
SPDs/SPGs may be tailored to fit local requirements at the time of application; however, such
changes are minor and may not impact the classification or staffing pattern of the local position.
Application of any Air Force NAF SPD/SPG does not eliminate the requirement for adequate
description of the local position or eliminate the responsibility of the Chief, Human Resources to
ensure proper application of the Air Force NAF SPD/SPG selected for use. If a local
determination alters the staffing pattern, a local position number must be issued. Approved Air
Force NAF SPD/SPGs may be found on the NAF Classification section of the AFPC Services
Human Resources website at www.usafservices.com/.
11.6. Supervisor Responsibilities.
   11.6.1. Determine the duties of positions.
   11.6.2. Use Air Force SPDs and SPGs when possible.

       Description.

   11.6.4. Report changes in duties to the Chief, Human Resources promptly.

11.7. Responsibilities of Chief, Human Resources. Chief Human Resources classify new
positions.

      12.2.4.1. The NAF-HR Section adjusts the pay of NF-I and NF-II employees using the
      average percentage increase indicated on the NAF Pay System Report for each pay band.
