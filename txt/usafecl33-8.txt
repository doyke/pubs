This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-3, Information Management. The
Inspection Checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and the USAFE
Supplement, inspection programs. This checklist is intended for inspection use. The checklist identifies
compliance items that support policy established by DOD 4525.6-M, Department of Defense Postal Man-
ual and DoDM 4525.8, Department of Defense Official Mail Manual. It applies to all United States Air
Forces in Europe (USAFE) Postal Operations. It does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) or Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication
on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to Directorate of Communications and
Information, Plans Branch (HQ USAFE/A6XP), Unit 3050 Box 125, APO AE 09094-0125. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the
Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in AF Records Management System (AFRIMS):

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Extensive changes in poli-
cies and procedures from the previous edition required a complete revision of this publication.


1. General. Use this checklist to prepare for Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI) and annual postal oper-
ations inspections. The checklist items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspec-
tion or assessment. As a minimum, units should use inspection checklists in conjunction with the Unit
Self-Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabili-
ties. Higher headquarters may use this checklist in whole or in part during visits or exercises.

    1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items identi-
    fied by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector General
    (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key result
       areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-com-
       pliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect system reliabil-
       ity. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, Department of Defense (DoD)
       directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs are referred to as significant
       guide items requiring direct Inspector General (IG) evaluation. Identify CCGIs by using uppercase
       and bold letters.
       1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall perfor-
       mance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance
       but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Identify CGIs by using standard
       sentence case.

2. Applicability. All items in this inspection checklist are assigned an applicability code designating
units that inspection items apply to (AFI 90-201 USAFE Supplement, Inspector General Activities, Table
A11.2., Inspection Applicability Table). Code 1 applies to HQ USAFE/A6 and 3rd Air Force, Directorate
of Communication and Information (3 AF/A6). Code 3 applies to main operating bases: Aviano, Incirlik,
Lakenheath, Lajes, Mildenhall, Ramstein and Spangdahlem. Code 5 applies to Munitions Support Squad-
rons (MUNSS) facilities: Buechel, Ghedi, Kleine Brogel and Volkel. Code 7 applies to Air Base Squad-
rons (ABS)/Air Base Groups (ABG): Ankara, Geilenkirchen, Croughton/Blenheim Crescent, Fairford,
Menwith Hill, Izmir, Kalkar, Moron, Alconbury/Molesworth and Stavangar. Code 9 applies to the 2d Air
Postal Squadron (2 AIRPS). The checklist includes all postal functional areas; however, inspectors will
only evaluate those functional areas that exist at each location.
