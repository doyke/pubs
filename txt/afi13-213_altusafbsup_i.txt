                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
   1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for developing an Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to
   provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and/or
   operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
   Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as a part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on an
   airfield.
   1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply with
   the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
   For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level instruction.
   1.1.3. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
   pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
   personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved
   with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person
   enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft
   without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). Runway incursions have the
   potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
   involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
   follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
   Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-
   vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
   1.1.4. Shared-Use Airfields. Airfield Management (AM) personnel at shared-use airfields
   (e.g. Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) must work with the civil airport manager
   to develop and implement local airfield driving procedures where applicable.
   1.1.5. Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield Authority
   (SAA) or equivalent, may authorize deviations to airfield driving procedures outlined in this
   AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated.
      1.1.5.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
      should be by exception only and include a Risk Management assessment. Factors to
      consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of time the operation has
      been in place and available resources.
      1.1.5.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
      deviations to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, for an operational review.
      1.1.5.3. Provide the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, an informational copy of
      approved deviations to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight,
      and developing area of responsibility execution activities.
1.2. Waivers, Recommended Changes and Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or
Procedures.
   1.2.1. Waivers.
6                                                AFI13-213_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2012


       1.2.1.1. Waiver Authority. HQ AFFSA/A3A will provide waivers to this instruction
       only upon an official MAJCOM OPR for AO request when a requirement makes a waiver
       necessary or compliance with creates a hazard. HQ AFFSA/A3A grants waivers to this
       AFI for a period not to exceed two years.
       1.2.1.2. Waiver Process. AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver will be used
       to request waivers to this instruction. If additional space is required, annotate on plain
       bond paper and submit along with the form. Number each comment with the
       corresponding block number. In addition, units will submit an Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Assessment in accordance with AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools or alternate risk mitigation procedures with all
       waiver requests.
           1.2.1.2.1. All waiver requests to this instruction must be reviewed/coordinated on by
           the Wing Airfield Driving Program Manager (Wing ADPM), Airfield Operations
           Flight Commander (AOF/CC) and Wing Safety.
           1.2.1.2.2. The AOF/CC forwards the AF IMT 4058 through the Senior Operational
           Commander (e.g., OG/CC) to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, who will then
           review/coordinate and send to HQ AFFSA.
           1.2.1.2.3. Submit additional data (e.g., Letters of Procedure (LOP), airfield diagrams,
           etc.) to substantiate the waiver request as required.
       1.2.1.3. Submit waiver renewal requests to HQ AFFSA No Later Than (NLT) 30 days
       prior to expiration.
    1.2.2. Recommended Changes. Use the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
    Publication to submit recommended changes to this AFI. Recommended changes must be
    coordinated on by the Wing ADPM, AOF/CC and host Wing/CC or equivalent then
    forwarded to the MAJCOM OPR for AO.               The MAJCOM OPR for AO will
    review/coordinate on proposed changes prior to forwarding to HQ AFFSA/A3A for final
    disposition.
    1.2.3. Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or Procedures. In accordance with AFI 33-360,
    Publications Management Program, a Guidance Memorandum (GM) or Interim Change (IC)
    will be used to prescribe procedures and guidance pending revision of this AFI. New USAF
    procedures/guidance will be distributed through the MAJCOM OPR for AO. GMs and ICs
    will be posted on the AFDPO website until formalized in this publication.

        3.2.7.2.9. Identify procedures for emergency removal or exit of vehicles and/or
        pedestrians in the event of vehicle/ATCT radio failure. At a minimum, procedures
        will include the following:
        3.2.7.2.9. (ALTUSAFB) Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians will follow
        procedures in AFI 13-213, paragraphs 3.2.7.2.9.1. – 3.2.7.2.9.2., in the event of radio
        failure.
            3.2.7.2.9.1. ATCT will flash the runway edge lights on and off to alert vehicle
            operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or emergency that
            requires them to immediately exit the runway.
            3.2.7.2.9.2. All vehicle operators/pedestrians must exit the runway immediately.
            Contact ATCT or AM immediately and advise off the runway and include any
            pertinent information that might affect safe runway operations. If not able to
            communicate with ATCT or AM via radio, use other means of communication
            such as a cellular phone (when available). Report incident to AM immediately.
            3.2.7.2.9.2. (ALTUSAFB) If radio problems occur, exit the CMA and contact
            ATCT via commercial (580) 481-7010/DSN 866-7010 or AMOPS via
            commercial (580) 481-6200/DSN 866-6200. DO NOT ENTER OR CROSS
            ANY RUNWAY OR TAXIWAY IF RADIO FAILURE IS SUSPECTED.

        3.2.7.4.5. Hot Spots (as determined locally) when depicted on a different airfield
        diagram.
     3.2.7.5. Procedures and standards to comply with airfield signs, marking and ATCT light
     gun signals. Note: Provide a detailed description and an example of the following:
        3.2.7.5.1. Airfield signs (e.g., mandatory and informational).
        3.2.7.5.1. (ALTUSAFB) Mandatory signs are provided when an instruction must be
        followed. A mandatory sign is internally lit and has white inscription on a red
        background. Informational signs are used as necessary to indicate a specific location,
        or destination on an aircraft movement area, or to provide other useful information.
        Mandatory and informational signs are depicted in Attachment 11.
            3.2.7.5.1.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Runway Holding Position Signs (Attachment
            11, figure A11.1). Runway holding position signs are located on taxiways that
            intersect a runway and correspond with Runway Hold Position Markings, as
            shown in Attachment 8. The runway numbers on the sign are arranged to
            correspond to the respective runway threshold. For example, ―17L-35R‖
            indicates that the threshold for Runway 17L is to the left and the threshold for
            Runway 35R is to the right. On taxiways that intersect the beginning of the
            takeoff runway, only the designation of the takeoff runway may appear on the
            sign. For example, ―17R‖ indicates the beginning of Runway 17R. Vehicle
            operators or pedestrians will not proceed beyond these signs without approval
            from ATCT. All vehicles and/or pedestrians will ―STOP‖ before the sign and
            contact ATCT to request permission to proceed onto the CMA, beyond the hold
            sign and marking location.
            3.2.7.5.1.2. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical
            Area Holding Position Sign (Attachment 11, figures A11.2. and A11.3). The
            inscription ―INST‖ is used for protection of the ILS critical area at Taxiway K2,
            and the inscription ―ILS‖ is used to protect the Precision Obstacle Free Zone
            (POFZ) critical areas, as shown in Attachments 8 and 9. Both the ILS critical
            area and POFZ signs correspond with Instrument Holding Position Markings
            (Attachment 10, figure A10.3). When the instrument landing system is being
            used, it may be necessary to hold a vehicle or aircraft at designated taxiway
            locations to protect the critical areas. This prevents vehicles and aircraft on the
            ground from interfering with the ILS signal transmitted to an aircraft on final
            approach. Vehicle drivers will be instructed by ATCT to hold short of either the
            ―INST‖ holding position on Taxiway K2 or POFZ holding positions (depicted by
            ―ILS‖ signs) at Taxiways H, K2 and E2 when operating during the following
            conditions listed below.
               3.2.7.5.1.2.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) The ILS critical area holding position
               procedures will be in effect when the reported ceiling is below 800 feet and
               visibility is less than 2 statute miles. The ―INST‖ sign identifying the ILS
               holding position is located on Taxiway K2 prior to Runway 17R threshold, as
               shown in Attachment 8, figures A8.1 and A8.3.
               3.2.7.5.1.2.2. (Added-ALTUSAFB) The POFZ holding position procedures
26                                         AFI13-213_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2012


            will be in effect when visibility is less than ¾ statute mile, ceiling of 250 feet
            or less, and an aircraft is on final approach within 2 miles of the runway
            threshold. The POFZ holding position ―ILS‖ signs are located on Taxiways H,
            K2 and E2, as shown in Attachments 8, figure A8.1. and Attachment 9,
            figures A9.1. and A9.2.
        3.2.7.5.1.3. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Non-mandatory signs (Attachment 11,
        figures A11.4. – A11.8.). Non-mandatory signs are classified as informational
        and guidance signs. These signs are used as necessary to indicate a specific
        location, direction, or other useful information. Non-mandatory signs include
        taxiway location signs, boundary signs, taxiway direction signs, and runway exit
        signs.
            3.2.7.5.1.3.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Taxiway Location Sign. This sign
            identifies the taxiway on which an aircraft or vehicle operator is located. This
            sign has yellow inscriptions on a black background with a yellow border and
            does not contain arrows, as depicted in Attachment 11, figures A11.1. and
            A11.4.
            3.2.7.5.1.3.2. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Boundary Sign. These signs are used to
            identify the exit boundary of a runway protected area and instrument holding
            position protected area. This runway protected area boundary sign has a black
            inscription that depicts a holding position marking on a yellow background, as
            depicted in Attachment 11, figure 11.7. The instrument holding position
            protected area boundary sign has a black inscription that depicts the ILS/INST
            holding position marking on a yellow background, as depicted in Attachment
            11, figure A11.8. Vehicle operators can use these signs as a guide when to
            report back to ATCT when they have exited a runway or ILS/POFZ critical
            area.
            3.2.7.5.1.3.3. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Taxiway Direction Sign. These signs
            indicate directions of other taxiways leading out of an intersection. The signs
            have black inscriptions on a yellow background and always contain arrows
            oriented to the approximate direction of the turn, as depicted in Attachment
            11, figures A11.4. and A11.5.
            3.2.7.5.1.3.4. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Runway Exit Sign. These signs are
            located prior to a runway/taxiway intersection on the side and in the direction
            of the exit taxiway. This sign has a black inscription on a yellow background
            with an arrow oriented to the direction of the exit taxiway, as depicted in
            Attachment 11, figure A11.6.
     3.2.7.5.2. Airfield markings (e.g. runway, taxiway, apron/ramp, instrument, etc.).
        3.2.7.5.2.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Runway markings. Runway markings are
        white in color and include runway threshold, designation (e.g. 17L), centerline,
        touchdown, and side stripe markings. Refer to AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations
        and Movement on the Ground, paragraph 3.5., for additional information. Note:
        Runway shoulder markings and chevron markings in the overruns are yellow in
        color to identify areas along the edge of the runway and overruns not intended for
AFI13-213_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2012                                                        27


           use by aircraft.
           3.2.7.5.2.2. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Taxiway and Apron Markings. Taxiway and
           apron markings are yellow in color and consist of centerline, edge, and shoulder
           markings. As depicted in Attachment 10, figure A10.5, taxiway and taxilane
           centerline markings consist of a single continuous yellow line to identify the
           designated path of travel on taxiways, through parking ramps, and to aircraft
           parking locations. Taxiway and apron edge markings consist of a continuous
           double yellow line to define the taxiway and apron boundaries from the shoulder,
           as depicted in Attachment 10, figure A10.4. Taxiway shoulder markings identify
           pavements that are not intended for use by aircraft. Refer to AFI 11-218,
           paragraph 3.6., for additional information.
           3.2.7.5.2.3. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Runway Hold Position Markings. Runway
           hold position markings indicate where vehicles, pedestrians, and aircraft are
           supposed to stop. These markings consist of four yellow lines, two solid and two
           dashed, extending across the width of the taxiway prior to the runway, as depicted
           in Attachment 10, figure A10.1. The solid lines are always on the side where
           vehicles, pedestrians, or aircraft is to hold. These markings are coincidental with
           Runway Holding Position Signs, and personnel must stop and contact ATCT to
           request permission to proceed beyond these markings.
           3.2.7.5.2.4. (Added-ALTUSAFB) ILS and POFZ Hold Position Markings. ILS
           and POFZ hold position markings consist of two yellow solid lines spaced two
           feet apart connected by pairs of solid lines extending across the width of the
           taxiway, as depicted in Attachment 10, figure A10.2. These markings are
           adjacent to the mandatory signs described in paragraphs 3.2.7.5.1.2. When the
           ILS or POFZ critical is being protected, as outlined in paragraphs 3.2.7.5.1.2.1
           and 3.2.7.5.1.2.2., vehicles will stop so no part of the vehicle extends beyond the
           holding position marking. See Attachments 8 and 9 for locations of ILS and
           POFZ markings.
           3.2.7.5.2.5. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Taxilane Wingtip Clearance Marking. This
           marking is used to define the limits of the designated taxi route and ensure
           appropriate wingtip clearance for aircraft taxiing through the parking aprons.
           These markings consist of two yellow broken stripes, as depicted in Attachment
           10, figure A10.3, and are located along the length of Taxilanes A, B, C, B1, and
           B2. Vehicle operators will park or drive vehicles behind this marking when
           approached by an oncoming aircraft to ensure appropriate wingtip clearance is
           provided between aircraft taxiing through parking aprons.
           3.2.7.5.2.6. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Restricted Area Marking. Restricted areas
           are identified by a solid red line on the pavement surface as depicted in
           Attachment 8, figures A8.2. – A8.4. Entrance is limited to authorized personnel
           only and the AF Form 1199C must be properly marked, worn and visible.

            3.2.7.5.3.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Runway Lighting.                Altus AFB runway
            lighting consists of runway edge lights, runway end lights, and runway threshold
            lights, which are used to outline the lateral and longitudinal limits of the usable
            surface of the runway. Runway edge lights, as depicted in Attachment 11, figure
            A11.9, are white in color and define the edge of the runway. Runway end lights
            are red in color define the end of the operational runway. Runway threshold
            lights are green in color to provide positive identification of the beginning of the
            operational runway surface. Refer to AFI 11-218, paragraphs 3.9.1. – 3.9.3., for
            additional information on these runway lighting systems.

AFI13-213_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2012                                                             29


        3.2.7.7.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Vehicles will not cross in front of an aircraft unless
        signaled to do so by the pilot or instructed by ATCT. Vehicle operators will never
        proceed between an aircraft and a marshaller.
     3.2.7.8. Procedures and standards for parking and chocking vehicles on the airfield.
     3.2.7.8. (ALTUSAFB) Vehicle parking and chocking requirements will be in
     accordance with (IAW) AFOSHSTD 91-100, paragraph 6.4.5.
     3.2.7.9. Procedures and standards to comply with fixed and mobile obstacle distance
     requirements. Identify and define the minimum clearance requirements for fixed and
     mobile obstacles in relation to the runway, taxiway, taxilane, and aircraft-parking apron
     based on the most demanding aircraft using the facilities.
     3.2.7.9. (ALTUSAFB) All vehicles operating in/or around the airfield are considered
     mobile obstacles. Maintenance and emergency vehicles operating on ramps/aprons and in
     the CMA have special separation standards and are not addressed in this section. All
     other vehicles operating on an airfield must comply with the following:
        3.2.7.9.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) The lateral clearance distance from taxiway
        centerline to parked or moving vehicles is 200 feet. When operating off the edges of
        a taxiway do not park or operate a vehicle within 200 feet of the taxiway center line.
        No vehicle will be parked and left unattended within 200 feet of the taxiway
        centerline.
        3.2.7.9.2. (Added-ALTUSAFB) The lateral clearance distance from the edge of all
        ramps and aprons to a mobile obstacle is 50 feet from the wingtip of any aircraft.
        When operating off the edges of a ramp or apron do not park or operate a vehicle
        within 50 feet of a moving aircraft. To ensure separation from any aircraft in the Air
        Force inventory, vehicles should park a minimum of 125 feet from edge of pavement.
        3.2.7.9.3. (Added-ALTUSAFB) The lateral clearance distance from the runway
        centerline is 1000 feet. When operating within this area, do not park and leave a
        vehicle or equipment unattended.
        3.2.7.9.4. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Mobile ground support equipment will be placed
        on the airfield (taxiways, aprons, etc.) no sooner than three hours before an arrival
        and must be moved no later than three hours after a departure. When such equipment
        is not in use, it shall be removed and stored in areas that do not violate aircraft
        clearance requirements for normal operating routes (marked taxilanes or taxiways) or
        other imaginary surfaces.
     3.2.7.10. Procedures and standards to comply with control tower light gun signals. Air
     traffic controllers use a light gun as a backup system for communicating with aircraft or
     ground vehicles if their radios stop working. When a vehicle operator experiences a
     radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they must vacate the runway as quickly and safely
     as possible and contact the ATCT or AM by other means, such as a cellular telephone to
     advise of the situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the runway,
     should turn the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait
     for the controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know
     and comply with the following signals:
30                                             AFI13-213_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2012


     3.2.7.10. (ALTUSAFB) Vehicle operators will be trained on and comply with control
     tower light gun signals IAW AFI 13-213, paragraph 3.2.7.10., and have AFVA 11-240
     affixed in all vehicles that operate on the airfield.
        3.2.7.10.1. Steady Green Light: ―Cleared to cross‖, ―Proceed‖, ―Go‖.
        3.2.7.10.2. Steady Red Light: ―STOP! Vehicle will not be moved‖.
        3.2.7.10.3. Flashing Red Light: ―Clear active taxiway/runway‖.

        3.2.7.10.5. Red and Green Light: ―General warning. Exercise extreme caution.‖
        During alerts and emergency conditions all non-essential personnel will withdraw to
        AM or their work control center until the emergency is terminated. The withdrawal
        of contractors will be at the discretion of AM.
     3.2.7.11. Procedures and standards for Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention.
     Note: Vehicle operators must make every attempt to stay on paved surfaces and avoid

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator, must know exactly what the controller
   wants them to do.
   4.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the ―microphone
   button‖, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   ―stuck mike,‖ and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time
they proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
 42                                              AFI13-213_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2012


intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always
give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   4.3.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER
                                      AIRFIELD ONE.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, JACKSONVILLE
                                      TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                      AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO
                                      CROSS (runway) AT

                                      OF (runway).”
   4.3.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

Table 4.2. Sample Read back Instructions
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS
                                       APPROVED TO CROSS (runway)

                                       SHORT (at location).”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                      “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                       AIRFIELD ONE CROSSING

ATCT:                                  ―AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.”

   4.3.3. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a
   read back to the ATCT.

or for you to hold at the Runway Hold line/VFR hold line prior to receiving approval into the
CMA.
Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Major Command (MAJCOM)—For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF Major
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. MAJCOM also refers to the OPR for Airfield

between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
AFI13-213_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2012                                                              51


Perimeter Road—A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Precision Obstacle Free Zone—An 800 foot wide by 200 foot long area centered on the runway
centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from
ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4
statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet.)
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.

aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
   1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
   2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC
instructions, AFIs and/or FARs.
   3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled
movement area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not
been authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission
was not understood or received.
