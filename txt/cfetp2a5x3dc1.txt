                   CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN

PART I

PREFACE

1. This career field education and training plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide
personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. To
read, review, or print a copy of current CFETP, go to http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. NOTE:
Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification
training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors will use both parts of the CFETP to plan,
manage, and control training within the career field.
2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression
information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. Section C
associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other).
Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and
facilities. Section E identifies transition training guide requirements to support career filed
restructures.
2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS)
and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training; Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) conducted training; wartime course requirements; core task; and
correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the course objective list and training
standards supervisors use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C
identifies available support materials. An example is Qua lification Training Packages (QTPs)
developed to support proficiency training. These QTPs are identified in http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil. Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine
resources available to support training; included here are both mandatory and optional courses.
Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors use to determine
additional training requirements unique to the MAJCOM.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in the specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan will enable us to
train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part
II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

SECTION A - GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers
(AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers,
supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training
program. This plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 2A5X3D should receive to
develop and progress throughout their career. This CFETP identifies initial skills, upgrade,
qualification, advanced, and proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS specific
training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty
for award of the 3-skill level. This training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical
training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification
requirements, and correspondence course requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill levels.
Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman
in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade
training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the
job. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency
training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable training courses, or on-the-job
training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum
required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes, some are:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field's training
program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an
individual's career.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the
training delivery method.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career
field training process.

2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comp rehensive
and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.
2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, Training
Detachment (TD) and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and
documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop
acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide identified training.
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training,
contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-developed mandatory training, to support
this AFSC, must be identified for inclusion into plan and must not duplicate other available
training resources.
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.
The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. The using MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field



                                             7                               Change 1 - April 2006
training requirements. The AETC training manager for AFSC 2A5X3D will initiate an annual
review of this document by AETC and MAJCOM AFSC functional managers to ensure currency
and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

5. Skill and Career Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice
to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its
mission. It’s essential that everyone involved in training do his/her part to plan, develop, manage,
and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will
ensure each individual receives necessary training at appropriate points in their career. Enlisted
personnel must complete all mandatory training requirements as outlined in AFI 36-2201, Air
Force Training Programs; AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification; and this CFETP for award
of the 3-,5-,7-, and 9-skill levels. The following outlines the minimum requirements for award of
these skill levels:
5.1. Apprentice (3-level): Complete a resident initial skills training course for award of the 3-
skill level. Retraining into a similar AFSC or shred may be accomplished via OJT alone only
when specified in the retraining instructions as approved by the respective AFCFM. Personnel
retraining via OJT may be awarded 3-skill level when the following are met: complete
knowledge training on all tasks taught in the initial skills course, complete duty position
requirements identified by the supervisor and all other mandatory requirements.
5.2. Journeyman (5-level): Complete mandatory CDC, if available, all core tasks identified in
the CFETP and other duty position tasks identified by the supervisor. They must also complete
15 months in upgrade training (UGT). Individuals in retraining status (TSC ’F’) must complete a
minimum of 9 mo nths in upgrade training.
5.3. Craftsman (7-level): Be a staff sergeant, complete the mandatory CDCs, if available, all
core tasks identified in the in the CFETP and other duty position tasks identified by the
supervisor. They must also attend the 7-skill level craftsman course (if available) and for award
of the 7-skill level individuals must complete a minimum of 12 months in UGT. Individuals in
retraining status (TSC ‘G’) must complete a minimum of 6 months in upgrade training.
5.4. Superintendent (9-level): Be a senior master sergeant.

6. Training Decisions. The CFETP was developed using a building block approach (simple to
complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Airborne
Surveillance Radar System career field. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and
how to meet these training requirements. The strategy must ensure we develop affordable
training, eliminate duplication, and prevent a fragmented approach to training. The following
decisions were made by MAJCOM Functional Managers and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) at
the Career Field Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) held at Sheppard AFB, 22-26
January 2001, the follow-on U&TW held at Keesler AFB, 20-23 February 2001.
6.1. Initial Skills Training. A decision was made to revise both the current E-3 AWACS 3-
level course and the E-8 JSTARS 3- level course. Course revisions are scheduled for October
2002 and are timed to coincide with the modification schedule of the E-3 and E-8 aircraft. Major
changes include modification of subject knowledge to include Radar System Improvement
Program and Computer Replacement Program data. The existing trainers at Keesler AFB are not
adequate to support training after the modifications are complete, and there is currently no
funding projected for replacement or upgrade of either the AWACS or JSTARS trainers. Hand-
on training will shift to the training detachments where upgraded trainers are available.

6.2. Five Level Upgrade Training Requirements. The 5-level CDC requirements were
reaccomplished to update the CDC to include information on E-3 (RSIP) and E-8 (CRP)
modifications. The 5- level CDC is changed to 2A553D and is divided into three courses: D, E,
and F. Course D covers common electronic principles, maintenance procedures, and radar
theory. Course E covers the AWACS radar system and Course F covers the JSTARS
surveillance system. Completion of all three is required for 5- level up-grade.
6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements. The mandatory CDC for upgrade to
seven- level remains 2AX7X.
6.4. Continuation Training. The purpose of the continuation training program is to provide
additional training exceeding the minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on
present and future duty positions. MAJCOMs develop a continuation training program that
ensures individuals in the Airborne Surveillance Radar Systems career field receive the
necessary training at the appropriate point in their career. The training program will identify
both mandatory and optional training requirements.

PART II

SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by Air Education and
Training Command (AETC) for classes beginning October 2002.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:
2.1. Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks,
knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-,
and 7-skill level. An asterisk (*) before the number indicates a wartime course objective.
2.2. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements.
Core tasks identified with an *R are optional for ANG and AFRC. As a minimum, certification
on all core tasks applicable to at least one Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft assigned must
be completed for skill level upgrade. Core task exemptions: (1) core tasks which are not
applicable to base assigned aircraft or equipment are not required for upgrade (units are not
required to send personnel TDY for core task training); (2) units are not exempt from minimum
core task training if aircraft/equipment are assigned to another unit on base, and (3) core tasks on
more than one assigned MDS are not required unless deemed mandatory by the MAJCOM
Functional Managers, commanders, and/or supervisor. MAJCOM Functional Managers,
commanders, and supervisors may designate additional core tasks as necessary. When
designated, certify these core tasks using normal core task certification procedures.
2.3. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and
knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document
technician qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification completed
date.
2.4. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as result of training on the
task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. When two
codes are used in columns 4A and 4C(1) (e.g. 2b/b), the first code is the established requirement
for resident training on the task/knowledge, and the second code indicates the level of training
provided in the course due to equipment shortages or other resource constraints. See
CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listing.




                                            18                               Change 1 - April 2006
2.5. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to
indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career
development courses.
2.6. Job Qualification Standard. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job
training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI
36-2201. For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. "Go"
means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for
accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures. When used as a JQS, the following requirements
apply:
2.6.1. Documentation. Reference AFI 36-2201V3.
2.6.2. Converting from Old Document to CFETP. Reference AFI 36-2201V3.
2.6.3. Documenting Career Knowledge. Reference AFI 36-2201V3.
2.6.4. Decertification and Recertification. Reference AFI 36-2201V3.
2.6.5. AF Form 797. Reference AFI 36-2201V3.
2.6.6. Disposition of Training Records. Upon separation, retirement, commissioning, or
promotion to Master Sergeant (unless otherwise directed by the AFCFM, MAJCOM, unit
commander, or supervisor), give the individual their training records. Also, give individual's
outdated training records after transcribing records. Do not remove any training records that
show past qualifications unless transcribed to a new CFETP/AFJQS. For example, an individual
working in a tool crib must maintain documented career field qualifications in case they return to
duty on the flightline or in the shop. Supervisors must exercise good judgment when removing
training records not needed in current duty positions.
2.7. Specialty Training Standard. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the
Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are
developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive
practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter
areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher
grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual
responsibilities are in chapter 14 of AFI 36-2606, US Air Force Reenlistment, Retention, and
NCO Status Programs. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve.
3. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to the
AETC Training Manager at, 365 TRS/TRR, 609 9th Ave., Sheppard AFB TX, 76311-2335, DSN
736-7891. Reference specific STS paragraphs. A customer service information line has been
installed for the supervisors’ convenience to identify graduates who may have received training
on task/knowledge items in this training standard. For a quick response to problems, call our
