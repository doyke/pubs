SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated references and formatting.
1. Policy and Procedures. It is understood that situations may arise in which the prescribed
course of treatment or care for a patient may be in conflict with the religious beliefs or personal
values of a staff member.
   1.1. It is the responsibility of the staff member to immediately notify his/her supervisor of
   his/her concerns and to request that he/she be excused from participating in that particular
   aspect of treatment or care of the patient.
       1.1.1. The 59th Medical Wing Code Of Ethics has been adopted to ensure that all facets
       of the organization's mission are performed according to the highest standards of personal
       and professional conduct. Adherence to these standards is neither optional nor selective.
       The staff of the 59 MDW shall not trade or compromise for financial, professional, or
       other gain, any of the standards described in the Code Of Ethics. Every individual's
       actions should be judged by considering whether the action is honest, decent, legal, and
       proper, and whether it could withstand scrutiny. It is the responsibility of every member
2                                                             59MDWI44-160 30 MARCH 2011


       of the 59th Medical Wing to act in a manner that is consistent with the organization's
       values and this ethics code.
    1.2. The supervisor will make a decision on the request. As permitted by the situation, this
    request must be communicated in writing by the staff member to the supervisor as soon as
    reasonably possible, but not longer than 24 hours after the initial notification. The request
    must include the specific aspect(s) of treatment/care from which the employee is requesting
    to be excused and the reasons for making the request.
    1.3. The staff member will deliver the written request to the first line supervisor who will
    keep a copy of the request and forward the original to the respective department chief.
    1.4. When a staff rights issue has been decided, the first line supervisor should deliver a
    written response to the staff member explaining the decision.
    1.5. If a satisfactory solution to a staff rights issue cannot be resolved at the level of the
    immediate supervisor, the issue should be raised to the next level supervisor (Medical
    Directors, Nursing supervisors, Chief Nurse, or Chief of Staff at the group or wing level), or
    to the Chief, Department of Ministry and Pastoral Care, if the issue involves a conflict with
    religious beliefs. When conflicts cannot be resolved within the organizational chain of
    command, members of the 59 MDW may seek guidance from the 59 MDW Human
    Relations/Equal Opportunity Office under AFI 36-2706, Military Equal Opportunity
    Program.
    1.6. DELETED.
    1.7. If there is any question about the validity of a staff member’s rights issue, before it is
    denied it is strongly recommended that the case be reviewed by the Medical Law
    Consultant’s Office.
    1.8. DELETED.
    1.9. The 59 MDW will attempt to make accommodations for all reasonable staff member
    requests for exclusion from patient treatment or care resulting from a conflict with the staff
    member’s religious beliefs or personal values. This may include honoring a staff member’s
    request for transfer to another department or service in which such conflicts are less likely to
    occur.
    1.10. Aspects of treatment or care which may fall into this category include (but are not
    limited to):
       1.10.1. Withholding life sustaining treatment.
       1.10.2. DELETED.
       1.10.3. Do not resuscitate orders.

       1.10.5. Selective reduction of multiple gestation pregnancies.
       1.10.6. Sterilization procedures.
       1.10.7. Writing prescriptions for certain drugs or filling these prescriptions.
       1.10.8. Blood transfusions in patients with certain religious beliefs.

     1.10.9. DELETED.
     1.10.10. Following a plan of treatment/care when the employee believes the best
     interests of the patient are at risk.
  1.11. The 59 MDW’s goal is to honor the religious, moral, and ethical views of its staff who
  request to be excluded from certain aspects of patient treatment/care for religious, moral or
  ethical reasons. The 59 MDW will attempt to accommodate all reasonable requests.
2. DELETED.
