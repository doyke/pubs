1. Scope.
      1.1. This instruction establishes responsibilities and operating procedures for vehicle operations on
      the Spangdahlem (AB) airfield. Airfield driving is for official use only, with maximum attention
      paid to safety and accident prevention. Drivers may not deviate from procedures or principles set
      forth in this instruction except in the interest of safety. Airfield safety is paramount; conscientious
      and safe driving will prevent most accidents. The requirements of this instruction must be included
      in the unit’s self-inspection program if personnel perform airfield driving duties.

        and 100 percent for the diagram and marking portion. Failures of either examination will require
        the trainee to be retrained and tested again no earlier than 48 hours later. After three failures the
        trainee and supervisor must bring a letter signed by the unit commander verifying the trainee is
        mission essential and must operate on the airfield to DAFM/AFM for approval to re-test. Upon
        successful testing, the AF 483 will be stamped ―Authorized Airfield SAB‖ or ―CMA/Runway
        (RWY) Access Not Authorized‖ and signed by the AFM, DAFM or designated AM
        representative. Authority must not be delegated outside AM. NOTE: Examination is updated as

          The vehicle must exit the taxitrack or taxitrack leg at the nearest taxitrack leg, access road or
          PAS and wait behind the white wingtip clearance line until the aircraft has passed.
      7.1.2. During snowfall, stop and yield for snow removal equipment. Snow vehicles travel at
      high speeds to clear snow and have priority over other vehicle traffic.
   7.2. Taxiway Papa. Taxiway Papa is a high traffic surface. Arriving and departing aircraft, AM
   Ops, emergency response and other airfield support agencies use it constantly.
      7.2.1. All vehicles will stop and get permission from the Control Tower before entering the
      CMA on Taxiway Papa.
      7.2.2. There is insufficient wingtip clearance for any aircraft to pass vehicles on Papa. In these
      instances, vehicles will find the nearest paved exit. If a safe exit appears impractical, follow the
      rules and principles in paragraph 7.10., Avoiding Aircraft. It is necessary for all drivers to have
      situational awareness and plan their movements ahead of time.
   7.3. Hot-Pits. There are three hot-pit areas within the Alpha Taxitrack (upper, middle and lower
   pits). It is imperative all vehicles and personnel follow the directions of the hot-pit crews while
   operations are taking place.
22                                                          SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009


        7.3.1. When the lower pits are in use, nobody is allowed to enter Ramp 3 via the FOD
        checkpoint by building 101 or the road next to building 203. Hot-pit crews will post signs to
        cordon off the area.
        7.3.2. When the upper pits are in use, vehicles should not enter the area within the red circle.
        Hot-pit crews will direct vehicles away from the area.
     7.4. Aprons. Aprons are used to park, load/unload and service aircraft.
        7.4.1. Reduce speeds when driving near parked aircraft. All vehicles will remain out of the
        loading and unloading zones of aircraft, except for vehicles and equipment used in such
        operations.
        7.4.2. Remain watchful for equipment and personnel operating in these areas.
        7.4.3. Watch for aircraft entering and exiting the apron areas.
        7.4.4. Equipment rules in paragraph 6.9. must be adhered to.
     7.5. Taxiways. Taxiways generally have a high volume of aircraft traffic.
        7.5.1. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) hold lines (see Attachment 3/10) are positioned where
        taxiways intersect with the runway. Vehicles may never enter the runway without express
        approval from the Control Tower. Always remain behind VFR hold lines unless given Control
        Tower approval to cross them.
        7.5.2. Operators will remain out of the intended path of aircraft entering or exiting the runway.
     7.6. Runway. The runway is the most critical of all airfield pavements. Vehicle operators will
     exercise extreme caution when operating on or near the runway. Access to and crossing the runway
     should be kept to a minimum.
        7.6.1. The Control Tower is the approving authority for any movement on the runway, including
        aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians. All operators will contact the Control Tower via the ramp net
        or ground control frequency to gain authorization to enter the runway or any area within 100’ of
        the runway. This also includes the overruns.
            7.6.1.1. Operators will report to the Control Tower when they exit the runway and must gain
            additional authorization to re-enter the runway after exiting. This applies to operators of all
            types of vehicles or equipment, including emergency responders and personnel requesting
            access on foot.
        7.6.2. Any vehicle operator told by Control Tower or AM Ops to exit the runway will comply
        immediately by safely expediting to the nearest exit and reporting off the runway. Operators
        forced to exit the runway may contact Tower to re-enter the runway after pending operations are
        completed.
        7.6.3. Any operator told to hold short of the runway (remain behind the VFR hold line) will do
        so regardless of their perceived need to enter the runway.
     7.7. Arm/DeArm Areas. Arm/DeArm crews must comply with wing tip clearance criteria and
     remain aware of vehicle and equipment located in the arm/de-arm areas.
        7.7.1. Crew vehicles will not be left on the taxiway, shoulder or arm/dearm pad.
        7.7.2. Arm/DeArm equipment, including fire bottles, will be promptly removed from active
        areas when operations terminate. Equipment may only be placed 3 hours before planned use and
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009                                                                       23


     left no longer than 3 hours after use. Equipment shall be stored away in the designated area
     over-night or during non-operations periods.
  7.8. Control Tower or Vehicle Radio Problems and Visual Blind Spots
     7.8.1. Users may experience radio problems on the airfield, such as poor transmission or receive
     capability. This is commonly known as a radio blind spot. Maneuver your vehicle to another
     location and try your transmission again. If a partial transmission is received from the Control
     Tower, ask for the instructions again. Do not proceed on the CMA/runway if the Control Tower
     transmission was incomplete or unreadable.
         7.8.1.1. Radio blind spots exist at both ends of the runway.
         7.8.1.2. The Control Tower will not allow any vehicles into the CMA if transmissions are
         broken, too weak or otherwise unclear. If these problems occur, obtain a different radio and
         perform a radio check with AM Ops or the Control Tower.
  7.9. Traveling From an Unimproved Surface to an Airfield Pavement Surface. Any vehicle
  leaving a paved surface must adhere to the following rules before re-entering a paved surface. This
  includes the runway, taxiways, arresting system, perimeter area and any airfield access roads.
     7.9.1. Vehicles will proceed from the unimproved surface and stop as soon as all four wheels are
     on the pavement area.
     7.9.2. Perform a roll-over FOD check of all four tires, the vehicle body, frame and the bumpers.
     Remove all debris from these surfaces and secure the FOD within a designated container.
     7.9.3. If unable to adequately clean the vehicle and FOD is left on the hard surface contact AM
     Ops to get a sweeper to assist.
  7.10. Avoiding Aircraft. Vehicle operators will follow this guidance in order to prevent interfering
  with aircraft operations and causing an incident or mishap. It is the operator’s responsibility to
  maintain sufficient clearance and to prevent operational interference with aircraft. When an aircraft
  is approaching and there is not sufficient clearance, locate the nearest paved exit, proceed directly to
  it and wait for the aircraft to pass. If an operator cannot locate a paved area, quickly identify a safe
  non-paved area for exit. Remain away from ditches and marshy areas if possible.
  7.11. Spotter Requirements.
     7.11.1. Aircraft should not taxi within 25 feet of any obstacle or obstruction, including but not
     limited to vehicles and equipment. Vehicles and equipment are hereafter referred to as vehicle.
     7.11.2. When vehicle operators find themselves in a location where they will be within 25 feet
     of a taxiing aircraft and they cannot safely exit the vehicle from the area, they must post
     themselves between the vehicle and aircraft to act as a spotter in a location the pilot can easily
     observe from the cockpit.
     7.11.3. The operator will carefully watch the clearance between the far outer edge of the wingtip
     and the vehicle to ensure the wing will not strike the vehicle.
     7.11.4. If sufficient clearance exists, the operator will waive the pilot through the area, observing
     clearance until the aircraft is completely past the vehicle.
     7.11.5. Aircraft will not taxi closer than 10 feet to a vehicle. If less than 10 feet of clearance
     exists, the operator must hold up both hands to stop the pilot from taxiing through. In this case,
     the operator must find a way to remove the vehicle from the area before the aircraft may proceed.
24                                                           SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009


     7.12. Airfield Facilities Protection.
        7.12.1. Vehicle operators must pay attention to their position relative to all airfield lights. Lights
        damaged by vehicle traffic cost thousands of dollars per year. Lights and their bases are
        designed to break when hit, thus limiting damage to aircraft. Airfield lights damaged by vehicles
        must be reported to AM Ops immediately. Check the vehicle tires and pick up any loose debris
        before departing the area.
        7.12.2. During the winter season (November through March) orange ―snow poles‖ may be
        placed on light housings. The poles are anchored to the light housing with the rubber tip
        removed to prevent it from being an FOD hazard. If the poles are run over or damaged, pick up
        the debris and report it to AM Ops as soon as possible.
        7.12.3. Vehicles that hit equipment or buildings on the airfield must remain in place and contact
        AM Ops and SFS immediately. AM Ops and SFS personnel will respond to the location.
        7.12.4. Any operator witnessing damage to pavement or coming across damaged pavement,
        should report the location to AM Ops as soon as possible. Also report large amounts of
        hydraulic fluid, oil or corrosive agent spills on pavement areas.
     7.13. Combat and Exercise Operations.
        7.13.1. Personnel required to drive in Mission Oriented Protective Posture 4 (MOPP4) must
        receive additional training to include a practical day and night driving orientation in MOPP4.
        The orientation training must occur during periods of zero or low aircraft traffic. A certified,
        non-MOPP4 uniformed trainer must be in the passenger seat at all times. An example training
        guide is provided in attachments 6 and 7. It is the responsibility of the unit to ensure proper
        training and ensure the individual can safely operate a vehicle in MOPP4; this is very important
        when operating on the airfield and in the vicinity of any aircraft operation.
            7.13.1.1. After the trainee is deemed competent to drive in MOPP4, the trainer will make
            ―MOPP4‖ annotations on the back of the trainee’s AF 483.
            7.13.1.2. Drivers will reduce speed when driving in MOPP2, MOPP3, or MOPP4. The
            principles of Attachments 6 and 7 will be observed at all times.
            7.13.1.3. As often as possible, two people will be present in the vehicle to aid situational
            awareness.
        7.13.2. If an exercise alarm condition requires a vehicle to stop on a taxiway, the vehicle will be
        moved to ensure no impact on aircraft operations.
            7.13.2.1. Do not park in such a manner as to pose an obstacle to taxiing aircraft or
            responding emergency vehicles. Remain only as long as necessary for proper alarm
            response.
     7.14. Cargo Deployment Function (CDF):
        7.14.1. During exercise and real world cargo deployment, Ramp 3 becomes a cargo marshalling
        yard.
        7.14.2. The Deployment Control Center (DCC) will advise AM Ops when cargo deployment
        operations will be in effect. This must be coordinated in advance to ensure no transient aircraft
        are scheduled to use Ramp 3.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009                                                                   25


     7.14.3. The DCC will coordinate directly with fuels to deconflict any wing ―hot-pit‖ refueling
     operations. During ―hot-pit‖ refueling all CDF activities on Ramp 3 will cease and all personnel
     and equipment will evacuate the area.
     7.14.4. CDF augmentees operating on Ramp 3 will not require an AF 483. These individuals
     will operate on Ramp 3 ONLY and are not allowed access to any other areas of the airfield
     without an AF 483 or escort.
     7.14.5. CDF augmentees will receive a safety brief from the DCC on Ramp 3 operations, driving
     boundaries, FOD control and advised they are not allowed access to the rest of the airfield.
     7.14.6. DCC will ensure an AF 483 qualified driver acts as a safety observer to guide vehicles to
     the start of the processing line and to ensure no aircraft are on the taxitrack.
     7.14.7. DCC will advise AM Ops when CDF operations are complete and Ramp 3 is clear of all
     equipment/personnel.
  7.15. FOD Control/Prevention. Airfield vehicles are major sources of foreign objects on the
  airfield. All airfield personnel have a responsibility to control/remove FOD from the airfield.
     7.15.1. Prior to entering the airfield and at all FOD checkpoints, stop, turn off the engine,
     properly set transmission and parking brake and perform a roll-over FOD check by visually
     checking the tires, body, frame and undercarriage for debris. (Note: Petroleum Oil Lubricant
     Refueling Unit-11 will be allowed to stop, chalk vehicle, and conduct roll-over FOD checks
     while the engine is running)
     7.15.2. Ensure onboard equipment is properly stowed/secured. Check for loose items on the
     vehicle floorboards, seats, or dashboard for items that can easily fall out if the door is opened
     while on the airfield.
     7.15.3. Obey FOD checkpoint signs at designated airfield areas.
     7.15.4. During winter, ice and snow chunks must be removed from the wheel wells, bumpers
     and vehicle body before entering the airfield.
     7.15.5. Operate vehicle on hard/paved surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If operating on
     unpaved surfaces, check and remove FOD immediately upon returning to paved surfaces.
     7.15.6. Do not wear hats on the airfield. Exception: cold weather gear as authorized by 52 FW
     policy.
     7.15.7. Personnel will only carry items essential to mission and job accomplishment and will
     abide by formally established tool inventory procedures.
     7.15.8. Operators will perform a roll-over FOD check after utilizing an airfield access road
     before the vehicle is again driven on any taxiway, apron or runway.
     7.15.9. Operators will perform a roll-over FOD check after driving in any airfield median or in-
     field area. All personnel will notify AM Ops prior to driving in any in-field area.
  7.16. Airfield Vehicle Restrictions. At times, vehicle restrictions may be imposed due to
  construction, operations, emergencies, quiet hours or other mission requirements.
     7.16.1. All personnel will abide by airfield vehicle restrictions.
26                                                           SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009


        7.16.2. AM Ops notifies airfield users of restrictions via email to the ADPM and by publishing
        local Notices to Airmen (NOTAM).                 All personnel may check NOTAMs at
        https://www.notams.jcs.mil. Insert ―ETAD‖ in the retrieval box and click ―View NOTAMs‖.
        7.16.3. The most serious restriction, a ramp freeze, is initiated when a portion of the airfield
        must be sterilized to stop all vehicle traffic for safety and/or emergency purposes. When a ramp
        freeze is in effect, vehicle operators may have to exit the primarily affected area, remain a certain
        distance from a primarily affected area, exit critical airfield areas or temporarily stop their
        vehicles and remain at their current location until the freeze is terminated. Required actions will
        be specified and units must have a process to inform airfield operators when freezes are
        implemented.
        7.16.4. Ramp freezes will be coordinated through the Secondary Crash Phone, telephone, email,
        and FM radio nets (when appropriate).
        7.16.5. Ramp freezes do not apply to emergency response vehicles or other vehicles directly
        supporting the cause of a ramp freeze. Vehicles not directly involved in response will abide by
        any established cordons.
     7.17. Jogging. Permitted on ramps 1 and 2 with prior coordination from the 52d Maintenance
     Group. Jogging is not authorized on the taxitrack. On Ramp 5 permitted only with prior
     coordination with the 726 AMS and will be restricted to shoulder areas only. Joggers must never
     enter active taxiways.
     7.18. Vehicle Operations during Snow/Ice Removal.
        7.18.1. Vehicle operators will make every effort to prevent packing of snow on aircraft
        movement areas in addition to minimizing the FOD hazard associated with snow/ice falling off
        vehicles.
        7.18.2. Vehicle operators will use the vehicle driving lanes as required. No driving should occur
        on the centerline unless duties dictate. If driving lanes are not available, drivers will operate
        vehicles along the furthest edge of the paved surface.
        7.18.3. No training should be conducted on the airfield once snow/ice removal operations have
        commenced.
        7.18.4. Personnel will restrict vehicle movement on unplowed surfaces on the airfield to prevent
        compacting of ice/snow. Vehicles should be limited to those required for immediate execution
        of duties on the airfield.
        7.18.5.    Tire chains may only be employed on airfield pavement after obtaining
        coordination/approval from AM, Safety and 52 CES. Requesting agency will conduct an
        operational risk assessment with the above agencies when evaluating the need for tire chains to
        minimize pavement damage and FOD hazard.
        7.18.6. Vehicles equipped with studded tires will not operate on the airfield.
        7.18.7. Snow removal equipment is exempt from the speed limits when necessary for
        operational efficiency.
        7.18.8. Snow removal equipment will not be required to stay within the driving lanes.
     7.19. Jet Blast Hazard Areas. There is a jet blast hazard any time an aircraft engine is running.
     Always use extreme caution when operating around running aircraft especially in the Alpha
     Taxitrack and PAS/hardstand areas. Pay particular attention to the areas listed below.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009                                                                    27


      7.19.1. Ramp 5 engine run area. Never proceed between the aircraft and the blast fence during
      an engine run. Follow the direction of the maintenance personnel doing the engine run.
      7.19.2. Hot Pit Fueling Areas. Follow the directions of the fuel pit crew.
      7.19.3. Arm/DeArm Pads. Do not drive behind running aircraft on the arm/dearm pads unless
      necessary. Always drive to the easternmost edge of Taxiway Papa if proceeding by running
      aircraft.
      7.19.4. Ramp 4. When aircraft are parked on the front row (west side of the ramp) with the
      exhaust facing Alpha Taxitrack you are not permitted to drive on the Alpha Taxitrack while
      engines are running.
      7.19.5. 22d Fighter Squadron FOD Check Point. Evacuate the FOD checkpoint when aircraft
      are taxiing from PAS 65 hardstand.
      7.19.6. Ramp 1/2. Do not proceed behind running aircraft when parked on Ramp 1 and 2.
      7.19.7. Smoking Areas. Smoking is not allowed in the controlled movement area, on any
      aircraft parking ramp, taxiway, or runway. Smoking areas must be approved by Fire Prevention
      and a copy of the approval letter must be provided to AM Ops.
   7.20. Night Vision Devices. NVDs are not authorized for use in the airfield environment. Any
   units requiring to operate under black out conditions must process a letter of procedure with the 52
   OSS/OSA prior to start of operations.
8. Controlled Movement Area Operations.
   8.1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
      8.1.1. The CMA consists of a large imaginary area surrounding the runway. The CMA boundary
      is defined by the instrument, runway, and controlled movement area markings surrounding the
      runway environment depicted on the diagram in Attachment 9. All vehicles operating within any
      CMA must have a designated call sign on file at AM Ops. This list serves to prevent duplicate
      call signs and provides a reference for airfield support/control agencies. (See Attachment 2).
      Vehicles will not enter the CMA unless absolutely necessary.
      8.1.2. Access into the CMA requires two-way radio communication and approval from the
      Control Tower. The Control Tower controls all aircraft, pedestrian, and vehicular traffic in the
      CMA. Pedestrian/vehicle operators must maintain direct radio contact with the Control Tower
      while in the CMA.
      8.1.3. Entry onto the runway or into/through the instrument landing system (ILS) CAT I/II
      critical areas (see Attachment 11-13) requires additional approval from the Control Tower.
      Approval from the Control Tower for entry onto the CMA does not automatically include
      approval for the ILS critical areas or runway. A separate request must be made to the Control
      Tower for entry onto/through each ILS critical area and runway. Vehicle operators leaving an
      ILS critical area or runway will notify the Control Tower once they have exited.
      8.1.4. During ILS CAT II conditions, vehicle operators will not enter the airfield by any means
      other than the primary taxiways. Vehicle operators will not use the access roads onto the
      arm/dearm pads while under CAT II conditions.
      8.1.5. Vehicle operators and pedestrians will observe the ILS CAT II critical area boundary
      markings running along the northeast portion of Ramp 5 to near Charlie taxiway (see Attachment
      12.) Operators must exercise extreme caution to ensure inadvertent crossing does not occur.
28                                                           SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009


        8.1.6. Vehicles on the CMA must maintain direct radio contact with the Control Tower in the
        event they are directed to exit an ILS critical area. Vehicle operators must advise the Control
        Tower when they have exited an ILS critical area.
        8.1.7. Whenever the MOCC requests maintenance personnel respond to the CMA, MOCC
        personnel will ensure the vehicle operator is CMA authorized and remind them to contact the
        Control Tower for approval onto the CMA/runway.
        8.1.8. POVs, golf carts and bicycles are prohibited from operating within the CMA. Contractor
        POVs will be given access to the CMA for specific projects. Contractors must have a qualified
        escort with them at all times and have radio contact with the Control Tower.
        8.1.9. In the event of a radio failure, watch the top floor of the Control Tower for light gun
        signal and expeditiously depart the CMA via the shortest route that does not enter/cross the
        runway. Refer to paragraph 8.4. for more information regarding light gun signals.
     8.2. CMA/Runway Access Procedures.
        8.2.1. Vehicle operators shall look both ways for aircraft taxiing, landing, or departing prior to
        calling the Control Tower for access onto the CMA or runway. Proper radio phraseology will be
        adhered to at all times.
        8.2.2. Requests to enter the CMA or runway will be initiated with Tower stating call sign,
        present location on the airfield, and request (what you want to do). Vehicles will hold short of
        the appropriate ―hold lines‖ until radio approval is given by the Control Tower. Vehicle
        operators are required to repeat back Control Tower instructions verbatim prior to operating on
        the CMA. NOTE: The Control Tower is often busy on other frequencies and may take some
        time to respond. Vehicle operators should be patient and pause before calling again.
        8.2.3. While under ILS CAT II conditions, the Control Tower will cycle the in-pavement stop
        bar lights to red.
        8.2.4. Vehicle operators will ensure the Control Tower uses their exact call sign/location.
        Hearing the correct location of your vehicle but the wrong call sign does not constitute approval
        nor does the hearing the correct call sign but the wrong location.
        8.2.5. Due to the complexity of air traffic control, other instructions may also be given, making
        it essential that vehicle operators listen carefully and repeat instructions back exactly as they are
        given. If unsure of communications, vehicle operators will always clarify instructions with the
        Tower prior to proceeding.
        8.2.6. Vehicles equipped with rotating beacon lights will have them on while in the CMA.
        Vehicles not equipped with rotating lights must have emergency hazard/warning flashers
        illuminated while in the CMA.
        8.2.7. Entering the CMA and crossing the runway merely for convenience is strictly prohibited.
        Personnel must use Arnold Blvd to reach the other side of the base, unless a runway crossing is
        absolutely necessary.
        8.2.8. Vehicles that must cross the runway should do so at midfield. Vehicles crossing at the
        end of the runway may also be blocked by aircraft taxiing as there is no space for vehicles to
        move out of the way.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009                                                                  29


     8.2.9. Vehicle operators leaving the CMA/runway will notify the Control Tower once they have
     exited to include identifying exit location. Avoid using the word ―clear‖ when informing the
     tower you have exited the runway and/or CMA.
     8.2.10. When tower requests a vehicle to exit the runway, the vehicle will depart immediately to
     an area behind the appropriate hold lines until authorized back on the runway by the Control
     Tower. Notify the Control Tower once the vehicle has exited the runway.
     8.2.11.   Airfield Management and the Control Tower will monitor proper radio
     phraseology/terminology and discipline on the CMA. The Control Tower will notify Airfield
     Management of any vehicles/ personnel observed operating in the CMA/runway without
     complying with the above procedures.
     8.2.12. During published airfield operating hours, vehicle operators are prohibited from
     attempting to obtain access onto the CMA, ILS critical area, or runway through a third party,
     such as Command Post (CP) or MOCC. Approval must be granted by the Control Tower.
     8.2.13. During snow removal operations, the Control Tower may relinquish control of the CMA,
     including the runway, to a snow control vehicle operator. During these times, personnel will
     coordinate entrance on/off the CMA, including the runway, with Snow One on the ramp net.
     Once control is returned, all vehicles and personnel will again maintain radio communications
     with the Control Tower and monitor the ramp net at all times until reporting off of the CMA.
     8.2.14. When the airfield is closed and the Control Tower is not manned, personnel requiring
     access to the CMA, ILS critical areas or runway will contact CP via the ramp net for
     authorization. During snow removal operations, Snow Control will assume control of the CMA
     from the Command Post. During this time, all requests to CP will be forwarded to snow control
     for approval.
     8.2.15. Maintenance crews may work in the grass infield areas with approval from Airfield
     Management. Crews will maintain direct two-way radio communication with the Control Tower
     and follow CMA procedures as outlined in this instruction.
  8.3. Convoy Responsibilities.
     8.3.1. Convoy leaders will brief drivers on route, speed, procedures, etc.
     8.3.2. Convoys shall maintain close formation at all times.
     8.3.3. Convoys will not exceed five vehicles at one time.              Fire Department, Airfield
     Management, and Security Forces are exempt.
     8.3.4. Vehicles or persons without proper radio equipment must be escorted by an individual
     who is airfield certified and has two-way radio communication with Control Tower.
     8.3.5. Leader will obtain proper clearance for all vehicles from the Control Tower prior to
     proceeding onto any portion of the controlled movement area to include the runway.
     8.3.6. Leader must say the word, ―plus‖ and the number that will be accompanying when
     requesting permission onto the CMA.
     8.3.7. Once given permission from the Control Tower, leader must communicate this approval
     to the escorted party.
     8.3.8. Convoy leader will notify the Control Tower after the last vehicle has left the
     runway/CMA.

     8.4. Control Tower Light Gun Signals .
        8.4.1. The Control Tower controls all traffic (personnel, aircraft and vehicles) operating in the
        CMA. In addition to, or in place of radio instructions, the Control Tower may use light gun
        signals. As in radio instructions, light gun signals must be obeyed immediately.
        8.4.2. All vehicles that operate on the airfield will prominently display AFVA 11-240, in plain
        view of the driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it
        can be flipped down for ready reference (see Attachment 4). AFVA 11-240 is available at
        http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. Drivers will know and comply with the following signals
           8.4.2.1. Steady Green Light: Cleared to cross.
           8.4.2.2. Steady Red Light: STOP! Vehicles will not be moved.
           8.4.2.3. Flashing Red Light: Clear runway or taxiway immediately.
           8.4.2.4. Flashing White Light: Return to starting point on the airport.
           8.4.2.5. Alternating Red and Green Light: General warning. Exercise extreme caution.
        8.4.3. The Control Tower will raise and lower the intensity of the runway lights as an alternate
        emergency exit signal during radio or light gun failure.
        8.4.4. The Control Tower will turn the taxiway lights on and off to remove vehicles from the
        taxiways when vehicles fail to acknowledge them by radio or response to light gun signals.
     8.5. Runway Evacuation Procedures.
        8.5.1. The Control Tower will contact personnel working on the runway via radio to evacuate
        the runway and move to a distance behind the runway hold line.
        8.5.2. When expeditious runway evacuation is requested, to the maximum extent possible,
        vehicles and equipment will be moved only on hardened surface areas.
        8.5.3. When immediate runway evacuation is required, vehicles and personnel will clear the
        runway by the most direct method without delay to include, if necessary, departing the hardened
        surface to a point behind the runway hold line or sign if line is not visible.
        8.5.4. In the event of a radio failure and if it becomes necessary for the Control Tower to direct
        vehicles or personnel away from the runway, the Control Tower will attempt to contact the
        vehicle through light gun signals. If the vehicle does not respond, the Control Tower will cycle
        the runway lights from the lowest to highest intensity to signal a loss of radio communication. If
        communications cannot be reestablished, the vehicle will immediately depart the runway. If the
        above procedures fail, the Control Tower will notify Airfield Management to respond and
        verbally direct personnel to exit the runway.
        8.5.5. Personnel will not return to the runway until given specific verbal permission by the
        Control Tower. If the vehicle departed the paved surface, a roll-over FOD check must be
        performed prior to entering the paved surface.
        8.5.6. Personnel experiencing radio failure or being unable to communicate with the Control
        Tower while on the CMA/runway will exit at the nearest taxiway and contact the Control Tower
        at the earliest possible moment to report off.
     8.6. Airfield Signs, Markings and Lighting .
        8.6.1. There are two types of airfield signs, mandatory and informational (Attachment 3).
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009                                                                    31


        8.6.1.1. Mandatory signs must be obeyed. The instrument or runway hold line signs are
        examples of mandatory signs. Mandatory signs have white inscriptions on a red background.
        8.6.1.2. Informational signs indicate a specific location or destination, or provide useful
        information, such as taxiway or ramp designations. Informational signs have black
        inscriptions on a yellow background or vice versa.
     8.6.2. Various markings are painted on the pavement. Vehicles must pay strict attention to
     markings which correspond with mandatory signs. These markings have a direct bearing on
     flight safety. Other markings define taxiways, roadways, or pavement boundaries.
        8.6.2.1. Runway Holding Position Markings are painted on the pavement and correspond to
        mandatory signs. There are two different hold lines commonly referred to as VFR and
        Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) (Instrument) hold lines (Attachment 3,10,11).
            8.6.2.1.1. VFR Runway Holding Position. Two solid six-inch wide yellow lines and two
            dashed six-inch wide yellow lines running across each taxiway. The dashed lines are on
            the runway side of the taxiway. These markings identify the locations on a taxiway
            where an aircraft or vehicle is supposed to stop when it does not have clearance to
            proceed onto the runway.
            8.6.2.1.2. Instrument Holding Position. Two solid yellow parallel lines with double
            vertical yellow stripes spaced two feet apart, These markings prevent aircraft and
            vehicles from interfering with signals transmitted to inbound aircraft from the ILS during
            periods of poor weather. Vehicles must stop behind the instrument hold line and request
            access from the Control Tower prior to entering the area.
        8.6.2.2. Taxiway and Apron Edge Stripes. Two continuous 6-inch wide stripes separated by
        a 6-inch wide gap. This marking is used when there is little contrast between the taxiway and
        the surrounding area. The marking delineates the edge of the taxiway or apron from other
        pavements or surfaces which are not intended for use by aircraft.
        8.6.2.3. Wingtip clearance lines. A single, solid white line at the mouth of each taxitrack
        leg, access road or PAS leading up to Alpha Taxi track and on ramp 5 and 6. This marking
        delineates the minimum distance from the taxiway or taxi track centerline where vehicles,
        personnel or equipment may be positioned to ensure proper wingtip clearance is provided.
     8.6.3. There are numerous airfield lights. If a light is broken or is found to be not operational,
     notify AM Ops.
        8.6.3.1. Taxiway edge lights are blue lights that define the lateral limits and direction of a
        taxiing route. Some lights will be above ground and some will be flush mount.
        8.6.3.2. Runway edge lights are white lights that outline the longitudinal limits of the usable
        surface of the runway. Most runway edge lights are above ground, but some are flush mount.
        8.6.3.3. While under ILS CAT II conditions, the Control Tower will cycle the in-pavement
        stop bar lights to red. These lights are flush mount lights located prior to holding position
        markings.
  8.7. Radio Phraseology. Using proper radio phraseology mitigates misunderstandings between
  vehicle operators and the Control Tower.
     8.7.1. Vehicle operators are required to read back all Control Tower instructions when
     operating in, or requesting to operate in or near the CMA. Reading back instructions indicates to
32                                                          SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009


        the Control Tower that operators understood the instructions and will comply with them. When
        in doubt, ask the Control Tower to repeat their instructions.
        8.7.2. Never use the words ―clear‖ or ―cleared‖ when in radio communication with the Control
        Tower. These words are reserved for communications between the Control Tower and aircraft.
        8.7.3. Example of Airfield 3 requesting permission to enter the CMA from taxiway Charlie:
            8.7.3.1. Airfield 3: ―Tower, Airfield 3 is on Taxiway C, request permission to enter the
            CMA.‖
            8.7.3.2. Control Tower: ―Airfield 3, Tower, proceed on the CMA from Taxiway Charlie,
            hold short of the runway.‖
            8.7.3.3. Airfield 3: ―Tower, Airfield 3, proceeding on the CMA from Taxiway Charlie.
            Will hold short of the runway.‖
            8.7.3.4. Advising the Control Tower when you are no longer on the CMA at Taxiway Echo:
                8.7.3.4.1. Airfield 3: ―Tower, Airfield 3 is off the CMA at Taxiway Echo.‖
                8.7.3.4.2. Control Tower: ―Airfield 3, Tower, roger, off CMA at Taxiway Echo. Hold
                short of the CMA.‖
                8.7.3. 4.3. Airfield 3: ―Tower, Airfield 3 will hold short of the CMA.‖
9. Reporting, Violations and Enforcement.
     9.1. Authority. Unit commanders, unit ADPMs, SF personnel and AM Ops personnel have
     authority to revoke airfield driving privileges. ADPMs and unit commanders may revoke airfield
     driving privileges only for personnel assigned to their unit. Individuals who violate the requirements
     in this instruction may lose their airfield driving privileges and/or subject themselves to
     administrative or disciplinary action.
     9.2. Responsibilities.
        9.2.1. Airfield Management, Wing Safety, and Security Forces patrols may randomly stop
        vehicles and check the driver’s AF 483 to insure that operators are authorized to drive on the
        airfield.
        9.2.2. It is the responsibility of all personnel working or driving on the airfield to report unsafe
        driving practices when observed.
        9.2.3. 52 SFS will monitor airfield vehicle operations for compliance with AFOSHSTD 91-100,
        SABI 31-204, and this instruction.
        9.2.4. Airfield Management and the Safety office are the primary airfield safety observers on the
        airfield.
     9.3. Violations. All violations must be reported to AM Ops, who will then notify the DAFM and
     the Airfield Operations Flight Commander. Personnel violating the provisions of this instruction
     may be removed and/or detained by Security Forces or Airfield Management. Airfield Management
     will investigate and report the infraction in writing to the unit ADPM, and unit commander.
     Depending on the severity of the infraction, Airfield Management may revoke the individual’s
     airfield driving privileges.
        9.3.1. When notified of an airfield driving violation, AM Ops will respond and escort the
        violator to Building 47. Airfield Management will obtain the individual’s AF 483. The
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009                                                                         33


     individual who committed the violation will complete a statement.              The unit ADPM and
     immediate supervisor will be contacted.
     9.3.2. If the violation is reported well after the fact, the violator will report with their supervisor
     to AM Ops as soon as requested.
     9.3.3. Security Forces will respond and provide escort, as requested. 52 SFS personnel can issue
     a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, to personnel who violate airfield driving
     procedures in accordance with (IAW) this instruction. 52 SFS personnel will notify the Airfield
     Manager of all violations or citations issued on the airfield environment.
     9.3.4. A CMA violation is an airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians
     entering the CMA without specific control tower approval. This definition also includes runway
     incursions.
  9.4. Consequences. Consequences for airfield driving violations may vary based on the nature or
  circumstances of the violation. The DAFM or AFM has final authority to determine consequence
  actions other than those mandated below.
     9.4.1. Runway Incursion. A runway incursion is the most serious CMA violation. A runway
     incursion involves the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of
     a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft. Runway incursions are often caused
     by incorrect vehicle driver position, loss of situational awareness and breakdown in
     communication with the Control Tower. These are further classified into three operational
     categories (Operational Error, Pilot Deviation, Vehicle/Pedestrian).
         9.4.1.1. Runway incursions that have an adverse impact on flight operations require
         completion of AF 651, completed by Air Traffic Control or the aircraft involved in the
         situation.
         9.4.1.2. Forward completed AF 651s to the AOF/CC who will forward to Wing Safety
         within 24 hours. Courtesy copy to 52 OSS/OSAM.
         9.4.1.3. The individual’s AF 483 must be surrendered to AM Ops and airfield driving
         privileges must be revoked until an investigation, retraining/certification is complete. As a
         minimum, violators will have their AF 483 and POV pass (if applicable) revoked for 30 days
         for the first offense and six months for a second offense. A third offense results in driving
         privileges being revoked for the remainder of their assignment.
         9.4.1.4. After the 30-day period, violators must be retrained by their unit ADPM. Retraining
         will include all requirements IAW this instruction. A letter of recommendation for
         reinstatement of driving privileges from the unit commander must accompany the training
         paperwork to AM Ops.
     9.4.2. Runway incursions and other CMA violations that do not impact aircraft operations may
     require completion of AF 457.
         9.4.2.1. ATC must forward completed AF 457s to AOF/CC to forward to safety. Send a
         courtesy copy to 52 OSS/OSAM.
         9.4.2.2. A violator’s AF 483 and POV pass (if applicable) may be revoked for up to 30 days,
         at the discretion of the DAFM or AFM for CMA violations. All runway incursions will
         follow rules stated above.
34                                                          SPANGDAHLEMABI13-203 15 May 2009


           9.4.2.3. Regardless of the revocation period, the violator must be retrained by the unit
           ADPM. Retraining will include all requirements IAW with this instruction. A letter of
           recommendation for reinstatement of driving privileges from the unit commander must
           accompany the training paperwork to AM Ops.
        9.4.3. For non-CMA violations: For first offense, the Airfield Manager will determine whether
        to revoke or suspend airfield driving privileges. Privileges may be suspended up to 30 days for a
        first offense. Common non-CMA violations are speeding (checked by pacing), having
        permission in the CMA but entering CATI/II area without permission, failure to yield right of
        way, failure to maintain safety distances or similar rules, failure to complete roll-over FOD
        check, failure to carry AF 483 while driving on the airfield, and failure to wear seat belts.
     9.5. Revocation Periods. Actual revocation periods will be determined by the AFM or DAFM
     after considering the severity and circumstances surrounding the violation. Below are some
     examples of possible revocation periods.
        9.5.1. First violation: 7 to 30-day suspension of privileges.
        9.5.2. Second violation: One to six-month suspension of privileges.
        9.5.3. Third violation: Permanent suspension of privileges.

job and have the permission of the installation commander.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—As defined in base Airfield Operating Instructions, any portion
of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific ATC approval for access
(normally via two-way radio contact with the control tower). CMAs include but are not limited to areas
used for takeoff, landing and as required taxiing of aircraft. NOTE: This definition is used in lieu of
movement area as defined in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary.
Controlled Movement Area Violation—An airfield infraction caused by aircraft, vehicles, or
pedestrians entering the CMA without specific control tower approval. This definition includes runway
incursions and infractions caused by communication errors.
Foreign Object Damage (FOD)—External foreign object that may cause damage to an aircraft or
equipment resulting in possible degradation of required safety or operational characteristics.
Instrument Holding Position Line—Two solid parallel stripes (yellow in color) perpendicular to the
axis of taxiway centerline with double vertical stripes spaced 10 feet apart. Vertical stripes of a pair are
spaced two feet apart. Boundary marking used to protect the ILS critical area (see Attachment 3).
Movement Area (USAF/FAA)— The runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airfield which are
utilized for taxiing/hover taxiing, air taxiing, take-off, and landing of aircraft, exclusive of loading ramps
and parking areas. Specific approval for entry onto the movement area must be obtained from Air
Traffic Control.
Runway— Pavement surface used for aircraft takeoff and landing.
Runway Incursion— A CMA violation that is the result of an unauthorized entry or erroneous
occupation of a runway or other surface used for takeoff and landing of aircraft regardless of impact on
aircraft safety. These incidents can be caused by aircraft, vehicles, pedestrians, or communication
errors.

Runway Environment— The runway and the area within 100 feet of the runway edges, to include:
overruns, taxiways leading to the runway beyond the runway hold line and grassy areas adjacent to the
runway and the area within the approach lights at the end of each runway end.
Runway Holding Position Line – Four parallel yellow stripes perpendicular to axis of the taxiway
centerline and extending across the taxiway and shoulders. The two stripes closest to the runway
centerline are dashed lines and the other two are solid lines. Boundary marking used to protect the
runway environment (see Attachment 3).
Taxiway— Artificially surfaced strip for taxiing aircraft to and from aircraft parking areas and the
runway.

                                   PHRASEOLOGY TRAINING

A5.1. Responsibility. It is the responsibility of all individuals who talks on the radio to ensure their
transmissions are conducted in a professional manner. Slang, CB jargon and incorrect radio procedures
can compromise safety. One of the most important items in radio communications is to speak in a
manner that ensures others understand what you have said.
A5.2. Radio Operations. Before depressing the transmission button to talk, first think of what you will
say. Radio transmissions should be brief and clear. Ensure someone else is not already talking on the
frequency or waiting for a response.
A5.3. Phonetic Alphabet. The phonetic alphabet was developed to avoid misunderstanding of
communications. Because letters such as "B," "C," "D," and "E" all have similar sounds, they can easily
be mistaken for one another, especially during radio transmissions. The following is the phonetic
alphabet:

Table A5.1. Phraseology
          A Alpha                                 N November
          B Bravo                                 O Oscar

A5.4. Radio Phraseology. Certain phrases are used in command and control and airfield operations.
Ensure you know the following to better understand what the Control Tower is telling you. These
phrases will also be used when communicating with the Control Tower.

Table A5.2. Radio Phraseology
                      Say again = Repeat
                      Speak Slower = Slow down rate of speech
                      Standby = Wait

                        Words Twice = Repeat every word again (twice)
                        Affirmative = Yes, or it’s true
                        Correction = Made a mistake and will repeat the correct information
                        Go Ahead = Proceed with message
                        How Do You Hear Me? = Readability
                        Negative = No
                        Roger = Acknowledged
                        Wilco = Understood message and will comply with instructions



A5.5. Examples of Use.
     A5.5.1. When requesting approval from the Tower, ensure you state the name of the agency you are
     calling, followed by your call sign. State your location and your request. Wait until the Tower
     acknowledges your transmission before proceeding. Always repeat the instructions given by Tower
     to ensure they were received properly.
     A5.5.2. If you receive instructions from the Tower and do not understand them, ask the tower to
     ―say again‖ and wait for the repeated message to make sure you understand.
     A5.5.3. If you are having a difficult time because the individual is talking too fast, ask the individual
     to ―speak slower‖ and the individual will repeat the previous transmission more slowly.
     A5.5.4. When the Tower issues time-critical instructions such as ―Exit runway immediately,‖ you
     may acknowledge by saying ―Wilco‖ or ―Negative,‖ as appropriate, preceded by your call sign. You
     will respond immediately to time-critical requests which may include the word ―expedite.‖
     A5.5.5. Example of Airfield 3 requesting permission to enter the runway from taxiway Alpha:
        A5.5.5.1. Airfield 3: ―Tower, Airfield 3, request permission to enter Runway 05 from taxiway
        Alpha east side.
        A5.5.5.2. Tower: ―Airfield 3, Tower, proceed on Runway 05 from taxiway Alpha, report when
        off.‖
        A5.5.5.3. Airfield 3: ―Tower, Airfield 3 proceeding on Runway 05 from taxiway Alpha. Will
        report when off.‖
     A5.5.6. Advising the Tower when you are no longer on the runway after exiting on taxiway Echo:
        A5.5.6.1. Airfield 3: ―Tower, Airfield 3 is off Runway 05 at taxiway Echo west side.‖
        A5.5.6.2. Control Tower: ―Airfield 3, Tower, roger, off Runway 05 at taxiway Echo.‖
     A5.5.7. Never use the words ―clear‖ or ―cleared.‖ These are only used between the Tower and
     aircraft.

A7.1. General Driving in MOPP4 adds more risks than standard daily operations, and makes
coordination more difficult. This attachment provides an outline of details that should be covered and
items that should be displayed during training. Where applicable, Airman Manuals/local guides should
be used to explain actions necessary during differing situations. This is only a guide. It is the
responsibility of the unit to ensure proper training and ensure the individual can safely operate a vehicle
in MOPP4, this is very important when operating on the airfield and in the vicinity of any aircraft
operation.
