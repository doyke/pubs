2.3.11.2. Crewmembers need not carry specific sections of flight manuals or checklists that do
not apply to the unit system or aircraft. If crewmembers remove pages or sections that do not

2.8. (Added) Flight Manual Technical Data Security. Flight Manuals (FM) (basics, revisions,
changes and supplements) contain technical data classified as Scientific and Technical
Information. Per AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information, FM data
requires the use of secured or encrypted methods of transmittal, and lists all approved methods of
unclassified flight manual data transmission.
3.5.2. HQ AFDW/A3OV serves as AFDW’s representative to the Flight Manual Executive
Steering Group (FMESG), but may delegate the responsibility as required.
6.3.3.1. (Added) 811 OG and 1 HS Flight Crew Information File libraries (flight manual
publication portion only) are subject to guidance specified in TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order
System, since they are classified as "Operational Libraries" types (TO 00-5-1 section 4.7). Flight
Crew Information File libraries must be inventoried annually to ensure the contents are complete
and current. The contents are compared to either a current “Master TO Report by Account”
listing provided by the servicing TODA, or against the TO Catalog.
6.3.3.2. (Added) To ensure currency of individual crewmember Flight Manual publications:
6.3.3.2.1. (Added) HQ AFDW/A3OV will publish in the supplement to AFI 11-2UH-1N,
Volume 3, a list of publications required for each aircrew position.
6.3.3.2.2. (Added) Units will review publication requirements annually/ to ensure an adequate
supply.
6.3.4.1. Flight manual issuance and accountability procedures are:
6.3.4.1.1. (Added) 1 HS/CC will appoint, by memorandum, an officer or non-commissioned
officer as the flight manuals control officer to carry out the requirements of AFPD 11-2, Aircraft
Rules and Procedures; AFI 11-215; and TO 00-5-1.
6.3.4.1.2. (Added) AFDW units will issue all required publications as listed in AFI 11-2UH-1N,
Volume 2. Electronic copies are considered current and complete only when all applicable
changes and supplements are imbedded/integrated into the basic flight manual. LEP checks on
electronic FMs will only be completed in accordance with para 8.1.2.3. When a crewmember
prints a hard copy of a flight manual an LEP check is required.
6.3.4.1.3. (Added) Flight manuals that are not issued or used as part of a reference library are
not required to be posted or current. Once issued, flight manuals must be current before they are
used.
6.3.4.1.4. (Added) AFDW does not “release” flight manual publication revisions, changes, or
supplements. 811 OG/OGV or 1 HS/CCV will review publications for accuracy and are cleared
to implement upon receipt, unless discrepancies are noted. If discrepancies are noted, 811
OG/OGV will contact HQ AFDW/A3OV for guidance before implementing the new or revised
flight publications. HQ AFDW/A3OV will coordinate with all using commands and provide
resolution guidance.
6.3.4.1.5. (Added) Unless discrepancies prevent, all flight manuals will be posted within 5
workdays from date received by the library custodian. Flight crew members will post all flight
manuals prior to flight.
6.3.4.2. The 811 OG/CC will publish written procedures to ensure flight manuals, checklists,
changes, and safety or operational supplements are distributed in a timely manner. These
AFI11-215_AFDWSUP 23 November 2011                                                              3


procedures will ensure aircrews have the latest publication changes that affect the mission before
operating or maintaining aircraft or equipment, along with ensuring individuals review new
changes and supplements before their next flight. This process is documented in part B of the
squadron Flight Crew Information File.
6.3.4.2.3. The 811 OG/CC will publish written policy that establishes a redundant system to
view the Flight Crew Information File library at all times, as well as a backup system for all
electronically viewed publications in the Flight Crew Information File library.
6.3.4.3. AFDW’s method of maintenance of flight manuals is the electronic medium. Paper
copies of flight manuals do not need to be current. Checklists from flight manuals are excluded.
Checklists may be either electronic or paper. Electronic and paper checklist must be maintained
current.
6.3.4.4. The 811 OG/CC will publish written procedures to ensure flight crewmembers
accomplish and document periodic reviews on their personal FMP to ensure currency. These
periodic reviews will be conducted, at a minimum, when a change or supplement is released for
the publication. This requirement may be conducted in conjunction with the LEP checks required
in Chapter 8 of this supplement.
6.3.6. HQ AFDW/A3OV will designate a MAJCOM representative for FMP and flight manuals
review conferences (FMRC).
6.3.9. 811 OG/OGV/1 HS/CCV may e-mail minor FMP errors through normal command
channels to HQ AFDW/A3OV. HQ AFDW/A3OV will forward the errors to the appropriate
Flight Manual Manager.
7.1.2. The text insertion method may be used when posting supplements and interim changes to
publications. Digital text may be inserted in available space on the affected page provided the
insertion does not cover existing verbiage and font properties correspond with existing text.
Write-in changes for corrections to title page(s) and LEP are authorized.
7.1.4. Flight crew members are required to perform LEP checks on paper copies of flight
manuals and checklists as follows:
7.1.4.1. (Added) Initial. When publications are issued, all pages will be compared to the LEP.
Annotate this inspection on the LEP page along with the date and reviewer’s initials and any

check is required to be annotated. Other dates are acceptable if a chronological table is kept.
7.1.4.4. (Added) Use of photocopies to replace missing flight manual pages, to include
checklists, is authorized until replacement pages can be obtained. This includes printed copies
from other digital files and may include write-in changes.
7.1.5. For routine updates, revisions, and suggestions, submit an AF Form 847 through
Stan/Eval channels to HQ AFDW/A3OV, for review and resolution.
7.1.6. (Added) Flight crewmembers will assemble flight manuals and checklists in their proper
sequence. Checklists may be tabbed for quick reference. Complete checklists derived from
different TOs/manuals may, for convenience, be carried within the same checklist binder.

Information File library and will be conducted as follows:
8.1.2.1.1. (Added) Initial. When a flight manual is initially inserted into the library, all pages
will be compared to the LEP. Annotate this inspection as “annual” on the title page or LEP page
along with the date and reviewer’s initials and any discrepancies (missing pages, improper
printing, etc.).
8.1.2.1.2. (Added) Annual. Check all pages with the LEP. Annotate this inspection as “annual”
on the title page or LEP page along with the date and reviewer’s initials and any discrepancies
(missing pages, improper printing, etc.).

with the LEP, annotate this inspection as “change” on the title page or LEP page along with the
date and reviewer’s initials, any discrepancies (missing pages, improper printing, etc.), and carry
forward the last annual LEP date and initials to the new title/LEP page. If a complete
comparison of all pages against the LEP is performed while posting the change, the reviewer
may update the previous annual inspection with the date and reviewer’s initials and any
discrepancies (missing pages, improper printing, etc.).
8.1.2.1.4. (Added) Revisions. When a revision is posted, all pages will be compared to the LEP.
Annotate this inspection as “annual” on the title page or LEP page along with the date and

data stored and ensure encryption when at rest due to high theft potential. Compact Discs are not
required to be encrypted.
8.3.3. (Added) Coordinate with HQ AFDW/A3OV to ensure a single source for digital flight
manuals.
8.3.4. (Added) Electronic TOs may be used in-flight as the primary source document. Flight
