  Operations Security (OPSEC) - an analytical process used to
  deny our adversaries unclassified – but sensitive -
  information concerning our intentions and capabilities by
  identifying, controlling, and protecting indicators
  associated with our planning processes or operations.
  Apply OPSEC to:
      -Military Operations – “Loose Lips, Sink Ships”
      -Personal Activities – “Loose Lips, Helps Thieves’
      -Professional Activities – “Loose Lips, Sink Jobs”
            Know Your Critical Information and Protect it!
