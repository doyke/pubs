                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to establish the AF NNMSB, describe its
purpose, operations, and scope of authority, and implement its safety policies and procedures.
1.2. NNMSB Members and Advisory Personnel.
     1.2.1. NNMSB Members. The NNMSB is comprised of experienced individuals designated
     by their command or agency. Members must have expert knowledge of AF nonnuclear
     munitions, related systems, and associated operational safety policies and procedures, and
     must be able to act as AF technical authorities for the purposes of the NNMSB.
        1.2.1.1. Members must also be knowledgeable of their command’s unique policies,
        procedures and operational limitations and constraints. They will staff within their
        commands or agencies all read-ahead material, resolve differences, and bring command
        positions to the board meetings. In addition, members will thoroughly evaluate each
        study and review documents prior to an NNMSB meeting.
        1.2.1.2. Members actively participate in all NNMSB meetings. Members present their
        command’s position and strive to resolve all conflicts based on the best interest of the
        AF. Members will arrange for a proxy when attendance at a meeting is not possible.
        When notified of appointment to the NNMSB, a new member will arrange for an
        orientation with the Executive Secretary. This orientation may be done in conjunction
        with a normally scheduled convening of all board members. If this option is used, the
        new member will coordinate his/her orientation with the Executive Secretary at least two
        weeks prior to the meeting.
        1.2.1.3. Members must possess the authority needed to ensure a comprehensive technical
        review within their command or agency of the safety studies and analyses on which
        NNMSB safety evaluations are based. The NNMSB membership is composed of one
        voting representative from each of the following commands and agencies:
            1.2.1.3.1. Headquarters (HQ) Air Combat Command (ACC)
            1.2.1.3.2. HQ Air Education & Training Command (AETC)
            1.2.1.3.3. HQ Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
            1.2.1.3.4. HQ Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)
            1.2.1.3.5. HQ Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
            1.2.1.3.6. HQ Air Force Space Command (AFSPC)
            1.2.1.3.7. HQ Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)
            1.2.1.3.8. HQ Air Mobility Command (AMC)
            1.2.1.3.9. HQ Pacific Air Forces (PACAF)
            1.2.1.3.10. HQ United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE)
            1.2.1.3.11. Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC)
AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013                                                            5


          1.2.1.3.12. Air National Guard (ANG)
1.3. Chairperson and Member Duties.
   1.3.1. The AF Chief of Safety, AF/SE, designates the Chairperson with the grade of Colonel
   (or civilian equivalent) or above. The Chairperson, or his/her designated representative,
   presides at NNMSB meetings. For a given matter before the Board, the Chairperson casts a
   vote only when a ballot of members present results in a tie.
      1.3.1.1. Members from HQ ACC, HQ AFMC, HQ AMC, HQ PACAF, HQ USAFE, and
      AFOTEC constitute a quorum for conducting NNMSB business. Under unusual
      situations, such as a short notice or conflicting requirements, quorum members may
      delegate their votes to another quorum member (proxy), provided the proxy member and
      the NNMSB chairperson agree to the delegation. When the NNMSB reviews nonnuclear
      munitions where operational use is limited to other commands (e.g., HQ AFSOC), the
      members from those commands will be included in the quorum requirements.
      1.3.1.2. Advisory Personnel. Advisory personnel (e.g., Explosive Ordnance Disposal
      (EOD), Air Logistics Center personnel) are invited to attend NNMSB meetings, as
      required. At times attendance by such advisors may be essential to the effective conduct
      of NNMSB business. Advisors do not exercise a vote during the formal proceedings. If
      the membership holds that inadequate advisory expertise is present to allow proper
      evaluation of munitions, then at the discretion of the Chairperson, review of the item may
      be postponed until a subsequent meeting.
          1.3.1.2.1. The Chairperson approves the composition of special ad hoc groups to
          provide NNMSB-related review and advisory services to special access programs.
          1.3.1.2.2. If not designated as the Chairperson, AFSC/SEW will provide the NNMSB
          with a representative to function as an advisor or consultant to the NNMSB at every
          meeting.
          1.3.1.2.3. Individual NNMSB members may invite advisors and consultants, and will
          notify the Executive Secretary of those attendees well in advance of the meeting.
          1.3.1.2.4. If the Chairperson, the Executive Secretary, or member anticipates that
          operational limitations may be imposed as a condition of certification of munitions
          for operational use, the Executive Secretary will advise the affected organization
          requesting NNMSB review. In addition, that organization will request participation
          by one or more advisory representatives of the affected AF Secretariat or Air Staff
          offices.
          1.3.1.2.5. Representatives, advisors, and consultants from other HAF offices or
          government agencies, as required, will be invited to attend NNMSB meetings when
          their munitions (or munitions requiring their expertise) are under review.
          1.3.1.2.6. Other advisors whose attendance may be appropriate are representatives of
          the AF procuring or modifying activity, the responsible test organization, and the user
          organization or unit.
          1.3.1.2.7. Knowledgeable medical personnel shall be invited to attend when items
          under review contain chemical agents; depleted uranium; radiant energy from
          electronic, optical, or sonic sources; or other biomedical hazards.

    1.3.2. The NNMSB may conduct joint reviews with the weapons safety certification bodies
    of other services for joint development programs. Joint reviews will normally be co-chaired,
    and can include participation of members from multiple Services. The NNMSB, however,
    reserves the prerogative to deliberate separately on a particular issue to achieve an AF
    position. Joint meeting minutes may also serve as official NNMSB minutes.

                      NNMSB MISSION AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. NNMSB Mission.
   2.1.1. The NNMSB functions as an overall design review authority and System Safety
   Group (SSG) for nonnuclear munitions and conducts assessments, approvals, and
   certifications throughout munitions research, development, test and evaluation, production,
   deployment, and operational life cycle.
   2.1.2. For nonnuclear munitions intended for operational use by the AF, the NNMSB:
      2.1.2.1. Reviews and establishes design safety and qualification test criteria, standards,
      and requirements for nonnuclear munitions and related items.
      2.1.2.2. Provides guidance to program management authorities throughout the life cycle
      of munitions programs and ensures criteria for safety certification reviews receive
      adequate consideration during the design, development, test evaluation, and operational
      deployment phases.
      2.1.2.3. Maintains safety awareness over all new or modified nonnuclear munitions,
      including those developed by the AF, those obtained from other US military services, and
      those obtained from foreign sources.
      2.1.2.4. Ensures safety certification or approval by another service or government does
      not replace the required NNMSB review and approval. However, certification and
      approval actions conducted jointly with another service’s certification/approval authority
      may satisfy the NNMSB review and approval process.
      2.1.2.5. Ensures a munitions or equipment item that is safety certified under the AF
      Nuclear Safety Certification Program (AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Design
      Certification Program) is certified for nonnuclear use, provided the nonnuclear portion of
      the system was evaluated. Such nuclear certified munitions and equipment items are not
      reviewed by the NNMSB unless specifically requested by a NNMSB member.
      2.1.2.6. Verifies whether loss of nuclear certification (e.g., restricted from use or removal
      from the Master Nuclear Certification List (MNCL)) has resulted in the loss of
      nonnuclear certification.
      2.1.2.7. Retains review and SSG authority and responsibility for nonnuclear munitions
      developed, procured, or otherwise obtained by the AF but not intended for AF
      operational use.
      2.1.2.8. When requested, reviews nonnuclear munitions items intended solely for foreign
      military sales (FMS). These items are reviewed, but not certified, by the NNMSB even
      without an AF end user. This ensures these items receive the same level of design safety
      review as munitions that are certified by the NNMSB.
   2.1.3. During the conduct of its safety study and review program, the NNMSB:
 8                                                AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013


        2.1.3.1. Ensures that munitions are evaluated against AF safety criteria, standards, and
        requirements and evaluations are based on analysis results and data obtained from
        engineering, development, and operational testing.
        2.1.3.2. Verifies (through results of evaluations) that required level of design and
        performance safety is achieved during all of a munitions item’s life cycle. An item’s life
        cycle includes all phases of development, production, and AF operational use (including
        transportation, handling, maintenance, employment, and disposal) from program
        initiation through item removal from the AF inventory.
        2.1.3.3. Reviews the safety aspects of explosives operations, when requested by a
        NNMSB member or HAF office, and recommends to the responsible organization actions
        to improve safety or occupational health provisions of the operation.
2.2. Systems, Munitions and Components to be Evaluated.
     2.2.1. Aspects of munitions systems, such as add-on components, software, and off the shelf
     equipment, will be evaluated as integral parts of the systems to which they belong. The
     following nonnuclear munitions systems, subsystems, components, and related equipment
     items, except as noted, are within the purview of the NNMSB:
        2.2.1.1. Nonnuclear Explosive Devices. All types of warheads, projectiles, bombs,

            NNMSB GENERAL AND TECHNICAL SAFETY FUNCTIONS

3.1. General NNMSB Functions. The following applies to all nonnuclear munitions systems,
subsystems, components, and associated support equipment the NNMSB reviews.
   3.1.1. NNMSB approval is required prior to airborne testing of live-loaded uncertified
   munitions and initiating devices.
   3.1.2. Prior to entry of new nonnuclear munitions into the AF inventory, regardless of
   source, a HAF certification for operational use is required. Certification will normally be
   based on NNMSB recommendation. Safety certification or approval by another US military
   service or foreign government does not replace NNMSB review and certification
   requirements.
   3.1.3. No munitions or related equipment items will be released for operational use until
   adequate technical data (maintenance, storage, loading, EOD procedures, etc.) are available
   to the user. Final certification will not be recommended by the NNMSB until final technical
   order and final hazard classification actions have been completed.
3.2. Technical Safety Functions.
   3.2.1. The NNMSB is charged with accomplishing the following technical safety functions:
      3.2.1.1. Tailoring design safety criteria and standards and establishing safety
      performance requirements for nonnuclear munitions systems, subsystems, components,
      and related items the NNMSB reviews and evaluates.
      3.2.1.2. Identifying and evaluating hazards in the design of munitions systems,
      subsystems, components or related items using the system safety engineering principles
      outlined in the current revision of Military Standard 882 (MIL-STD-882D). In addition,
      the NNMSB recommends methods to reduce the risk of hazards identified during
      NNMSB proceedings to obtain a level acceptable to the AF.
      3.2.1.3. Establishing or approving procedures and warnings to help protect personnel,
      equipment, and property when risks cannot be adequately controlled through design
      provisions.
      3.2.1.4. Developing safety recommendations, which minimize risk during the life cycle
      of nonnuclear munitions, taking into consideration the mission requirements,
      employment concepts, and operating environments.
      3.2.1.5. Minimizing retrofit actions required to improve design safety. The NNMSB
      accomplishes this by identifying and including safety design criteria during the
      development phase of munitions systems, subsystem, component or related item.
      3.2.1.6. Using historical safety data and lessons learned from similar munitions programs
      to help evaluate new designs.
3.3. Insensitive Munitions Technical Working Group (IMTWG).
   3.3.1. The IMTWG is an established subgroup of the NNMSB and assists and acts on behalf
   of the NNMSB with respect to its role in the AF Insensitive Munitions (IM) program. The
AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013                                                     11


  IMTWG serves as a source of expertise to advise the NNMSB on all matters pertaining to IM
  program management and technical requirements. The IMTWG briefs current activities to
  the NNMSB during regularly scheduled meetings.
 12                                            AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013


                                          Chapter 4

      CERTIFICATION, STUDIES, TEST, AND SAFETY STANDARD FUNCTIONS

4.1. Overview. NNMSB design safety certification action is required for nonnuclear munitions
prior to entry into the AF operational inventory and is accomplished through review of various
safety studies and test results. In addition, the NNMSB will not recommend final certification
until adequate technical data is available to the user.
4.2. Certification.
   4.2.1. A design safety certification is based on a Technical Munitions Safety Study (TMSS)
   or Munitions Safety Analysis (MSA) reviewed during a regular or special meeting.
       4.2.1.1. The TMSS is a comprehensive safety study of nonnuclear munitions, used to
       document safety engineering evaluations and to submit safety findings for NNMSB
       review. The TMSS must contain sufficient information to fully support the certification
       recommendations formulated by the board.
       4.2.1.2. The MSA is a less comprehensive safety study than the TMSS and is typically
       prepared for munitions support equipment and less complex systems (e.g.
       countermeasure flares, flight termination systems for drones) that have a minor impact on
       safety. Like the TMSS, the MSA must fully support NNMSB positions.
   4.2.2. Although the MSA is not subject to HAF approval after NNMSB review (except as
   noted below in paragraph 4.2.6.), the MSA should not be used as the basis for Board action
   when a certification issue regarding higher level management attention is expected,
   regardless of the development status or intended use of the item under review. The
   Executive Secretary is available to provide guidance as to the appropriateness of the MSA
   versus the TMSS for any given item.
   4.2.3. A non-complex review and approval or certification actions under NNMSB purview
   may not require a TMSS, TMSS supplement, MSA, or Test Hazards Assessment Review
   (THAR) (e.g. use of a modified bomb sling, flight testing of a practice bomb with a spotting
   charge, or certification of small arms, or small arms ammunition). For such actions, the
   NNMSB has delegated approval or certification authority to the Executive Secretary. Each
   item certified by the Executive Secretary will be approved through the use of an Executive
   Secretary Letter. These letters will be maintained on file by the Executive Secretary. At
   each regularly scheduled meeting of the NNMSB, the Executive Secretary will inform the
   Board of such approvals or certifications accomplished subsequent to the previous meeting.
   4.2.4. The Chairperson and NNMSB members will be provided the draft edition of the
   TMSS or MSA in sufficient time prior to the scheduled meeting to allow proper review
   within the members’ MAJCOMs. In no case will the review time be less than 25 days (for 2
   or less straightforward weapons studies). For ambitious meeting agendas (for example, 4 or
   5 studies for complex weapons), some of the draft TMSSs and MSAs will be distributed 45-
   50 days in advance, to level the members’ review work load. Read-ahead information will
   also be provided for other (non-certification) meeting business requiring a NNMSB decision.
   Such read-ahead information will be provided at least 14 days prior to the meeting. If any
AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013                                                         13


   Board member states insufficient time was provided for a proper MAJCOM review, then the
   item in question will be removed from the meeting agenda.
   4.2.5. If during their TMSS or MSA review, the Board members have questions or identify
   concerns, they will inform the TMSS or MSA preparing activity so that additional
   information may be made available at the NNMSB meeting.
   4.2.6. Following formal review of the draft safety study, NNMSB design safety conclusions
   and certification recommendations are included in the TMSS or MSA. The TMSS is then
   prepared for release to HAF and SAF offices.
   4.2.7. The Executive Secretary will maintain up-to-date reference material on the scope,
   content, level of detail, and format requirements for the TMSS and MSA and will provide
   appropriate guidance to agencies charged with preparing a TMSS or MSA.
4.3. Test Approval Functions.
   4.3.1. The NNMSB issues design safety approvals for testing of uncertified munitions items
   listed in paragraph 2.2 and initiating devices (e.g. fuzes) involving the airborne launch of
   munitions from AF aircraft and aircraft not in the AF inventory flown by AF pilots. The
   captive carriage phase of such flight test programs may be entered prior to NNMSB approval
   for the live launch phase. NNMSB approval is not required for flight test of new munitions
   that are inert when loaded.
   4.3.2. The basis for the flight test approval is the THAR conducted during a regular or
   special meeting.
      4.3.2.1. Under extraordinary circumstances the Board members may be requested to
      issue flight test approvals individually in lieu of a formal meeting. In this situation,
      approval must be unanimous. This procedure may be used only with the agreement of
      the Chairperson and all quorum members.
      4.3.2.2. The Board members and Chairperson will be provided read-ahead information at
      least 14 days prior to conducting a THAR. Such information may be a simple point
      paper for non-complex items, or it may be a comprehensive technical data package for
      test munitions that are potentially more hazardous.
   4.3.3. If an NNMSB flight test approval is issued conditional upon completion of follow-on
   actions, the Executive Secretary will monitor these actions until their completion. If
   NNMSB flight test approval is not issued, the Executive Secretary will inform the requesting
   agency of the reasons for non-approval.
4.4. Safety Standards and Functions.
   4.4.1. The NNMSB is the AF focal point for the development and/or adoption of design and
   performance safety standards for nonnuclear munitions.
   4.4.2. Once approved by the NNMSB, safety standards and functions play a major role in
   determining a munitions design safety acceptability during the Board certification process.
   This applies equally to munitions developed or procured for performance or commercial
   specifications.
 14                                              AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013


   4.4.3. Attachment 3 lists standards currently approved by the NNMSB and considered
   applicable to the design, development, test, and evaluation of nonnuclear munitions intended
   for use by AF units.
   4.4.4. The Executive Secretary will maintain awareness of applicable national and
   international standardization activities (including those in the private sector) and offer
   additional standards for possible NNMSB approval as appropriate. See Attachment 3.
   4.4.5. In its capacity as the AF nonnuclear munitions SSG, the NNMSB provides munitions
   safety guidance to program management authorities responsible for acquisition of nonnuclear
   munitions. This guidance can be on design safety, analysis, and testing matters that could
   have a bearing on future certification. Guidance formulated by the NNMSB will be
   documented in the meeting proceedings. If a program management authority believes this
   approach might impact acquisition strategy, the NNMSB may direct the Executive Secretary
   to provide the guidance to the weapons program management authority. All official
   correspondence associated with NNMSB guidance or Executive Secretary letters will be
   maintained by the Executive Secretary.
4.5. Non AF Use Ammunition in the Joint Safety Review Process.
   4.5.1. The Executive Secretary for the AF NNMSB is the AF representative to joint safety
   review processes. He/she provides AF coordination for joint weapon systems and munitions
   that are presented for use by Services/organizations other than the AF.
       4.5.1.1. If joint weapon systems and munitions are to be used by AF personnel, the
       respective agencies must follow the instructions outlined in Section 5.2.1 for the desired
       systems/munitions in order to support a review by the full NNMSB voting panel in
       conjunctions with other Service safety review boards for approval/certification, as
       defined by this AFI.
       4.5.1.2. When the NNMSB Executive Secretary receives a request for review by the
       Joint Safety Boards for joint service approvals of weapons systems and munitions that
       will not be used by AF personnel, the Executive Secretary will reply that no NNMSB
       review is required.
   4.5.2. To expedite a joint safety review, the convening of a special session or an electronic
   review by specific members of the NNMSB will be decided by the Board Chairperson.
   4.5.3. The Executive Secretary has authority to assign members to an AF review group if
   needed to review joint weapons systems and munitions for AF or non-AF use.
4.6. Risk Assessment. The NNMSB issues a risk assessment for instances when urgent
timelines are not sufficient to support the normal Certification/Test Approval process. The intent
of the risk assessment is to evaluate hazards based on information gathered to support an
Emergency Operational Capability (EOC) for urgent military operations to ensure the
appropriate level of risk mitigation or acceptance is achieved.
   4.6.1. Determine acceptability of risks in accordance with MIL-STD-882D, Systems Safety.
   4.6.2. Determine risk acceptance authority in accordance with DoDI 5000.02, Operation of
   the Defense Acquisition System, AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
   Management, and MIL-STD-882D, Systems Safety.
AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013                                                           15


                                          Chapter 5

                            SAFETY STUDIES AND REVIEWS

5.1. Overview. The primary tool used by the NNMSB to evaluate the nonnuclear munitions and
related equipment items is a positive safety study and review program set forth in MIL-STD-
882D, Systems Safety. Application of MIL-STD-882D, Systems Safety techniques provides
assurance that nonnuclear munitions and associated support and test equipment items, other
munitions related items, and all operating procedures and technical data meet the highest safety
standards.     The safety evaluation process considers design, logistics, and operational
requirements throughout a munitions item’s life cycle. The program requires maximum use of
existing safety documentation and lessons learned.
5.2. Nonnuclear Munitions Safety Study and Review Process
   5.2.1. The agency (Program Executive Officers, Designated Acquisition Commanders,
   System Program Directors, Product Group Managers, Joint Program Offices, etc.)
   responsible for procuring or modifying nonnuclear munitions, including all nonnuclear
   missiles and related items specified in paragraph 2.2, is also responsible for ensuring the
   requirements of this directive are satisfied. These management and responsibilities include:
       5.2.1.1. Ensuring a munitions item requiring NNMSB study and review is identified to
       the Executive Secretary or his/her designated Systems Safety Engineer early in the design
       or acquisition process. This allows review and certification actions to begin early enough
       to minimize any affect of the NNMSB review on schedule and procurement costs.
       5.2.1.2. Ensuring compliance with all required design safety standards (in paragraph 6.1)
       and that adequate resources are allocated for explosives hazard classification and
       insensitive munitions action (including testing as specified in TO 11A-1-47, DoD
       Ammunition and Explosives Hazard Classification Procedures and current revision of
       MIL-STD-2105C, Department of Defense Test Method Standard: Hazard Assessment
       Tests for Nonnuclear Munitions).
       5.2.1.3. Ensuring appropriate safety studies (TMSS, MSA, or THAR) are prepared at the
       earliest date possible in the development cycle as outlined below. In addition, early
       reviews by the NNMSB are highly desirable so impacts of safety related design changes,
       if any, are minimized.
   5.2.2. Designated Systems Safety Engineers will work with the responsible agency to
   ensure:
       5.2.2.1. A copy of the study or review documentation is submitted to the Executive
       Secretary at least 45 days prior to the NNMSB meeting. Final design drawings,
       electronics diagrams, copies of fault tree analyses, etc. will be provided by the
       responsible agency no later than 90 days prior to the NNMSB meeting.
       5.2.2.2. Review documents and a study or review presentation are provided at the
       scheduled NNMSB meeting. The purpose of the presentation is to address design safety
       issues of the items under review and to respond to any concerns or questions the NNMSB
       members may have. In addition, guidance on presentation scope, level of detail, and
       format should be requested from the Executive Secretary.

   5.2.3. Requests for release of information contained in a staff approved TMSS, MSA, or
   THAR must be submitted to the Executive Secretary.
5.3. Preparing a Technical Munitions Safety Study (TMSS) (see Attachment 2). The TMSS
is a detailed safety study of nonnuclear munitions and is used to document safety engineering
findings and to submit safety recommendations for NNMSB review. A TMSS is,
   5.3.1. Prepared for nonnuclear munitions and related items of which the NNMSB maintains
   awareness as specified in this instruction.
   5.3.2. Prepared by a HQ AFMC system safety engineering organization or by any other
   organization possessing sufficient safety engineering expertise.
   5.3.3. A document used to present only the necessary design/performance details required
   for system evaluation and not as a source data for muntions. NOTE: Data in a TMSS may
   contain proprietary and/or privileged information.
   5.3.4. Usually prepared following the start of development, test, and evaluation (DT&E), or
   following the start of the initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) portion of a
   combined DT&E/IOT&E.
   5.3.5. Reviewed by the NNMSB and approved by the appropriate staff agencies prior to
   entry of production items into the AF inventory.
   5.3.6. Forwarded to applicable staff agencies with the NNMSB’s recommendations for
   coordination. Upon staff approval, a NNMSB recommendation becomes a directive on the
   specified action agencies.
5.4. Preparing a Munitions Safety Analysis (MSA). When the preparing activity decides that
munitions support equipment and less complex systems (e.g. countermeasure flares, flight
termination systems) has only minor impact on safety, the activity may prepare, with the
concurrence of the Executive Secretary of the NNMSB, an MSA instead of a complete TMSS.
However, the NNMSB may direct that a complete TMSS be prepared on the item in lieu of the
MSA. An MSA is,
   5.4.1. Needed to support a conclusion that a munitions item or modification of a munitions
   item has only a minor impact on safety.
   5.4.2. Required for newly designed or modified unique or peculiar support equipment used
   with nonnuclear munitions. Staff agency review and approval of the MSA is not required.
   5.4.3. Prepared by a HQ AFMC system safety engineering organization or by any other
   organization possessing sufficient safety engineering expertise.
   5.4.4. Not used as source data for munitions and should present only the necessary
   design/performance details required for system evaluation. NOTE: Data in an MSA may
   contain proprietary and/or privileged information.
5.5. Preparing a Test Hazards Assessment Review (THAR). A THAR is the minimum
analysis necessary before live airborne testing of uncertified munition items.
   5.5.1. The intent of this assessment is to prevent danger to, or loss of, aircrew and aircraft
   during live test of uncertified munitions and initiating devices.
AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013                                                             17


   5.5.2. Munitions must be approved by the NNMSB for live airborne testing to include items
   loaded with live energetic material such as bombs, warheads, cluster bomb units, projectiles,
   rocket motors, flares, bursting charges, or similar devices.
   5.5.3. Initiating devices must be approved for live airborne testing to include fuzes, rocket
   motor arm/fire devices, flare safety and ignition devices, guidance sections, and devices
   having an influence on initiation, such as retarders, launchers, and suspension racks.
   5.5.4. The live flight test approval requirement does not prevent test of uncertified initiating
   systems when the items are inert filled.
   5.5.5. A THAR must contain a physical and functional description of the item and sufficient
   analysis to ensure the item is safe for use within the controlled test environment. Review and
   approval of a TMSS or an MSA by the NNMSB satisfies the requirement for a THAR.
   5.5.6. A THAR is prepared by a HQ AFMC system safety engineering organization or by
   any other organization possessing sufficient safety engineering expertise as determined by
   the NNMSB.
   5.5.7. The THAR should not be used as source data for munitions and should be considered
   to carry the same limitations on disclosure as other safety documentation used expressly for
   mishap prevention.
5.6. Preparing a Risk Assessment (RA). An RA is for rare instances when urgent timelines
are not sufficient to support the normal Certification/Test Approval process.
   5.6.1. If Emergency Operational Capability (EOC) is requested by combatant commands to
   support an urgent military operation, the Program Manager (PM) will submit a RA request
   through the MAJCOM to AFSC/SEW for NNMSB coordination and approval.
   5.6.2. The EOC request must include a Residual Risk Analysis (RRA). An RRA is an
   overall assessment of a system’s suitability for emergency operations from a safety
   perspective. It should provide all information necessary to make informed risk management
   decisions. The RRA must include:
      5.6.2.1. A risk analysis using the approach outlined in MIL-STD-882D, Systems Safety.
      5.6.2.2. Recommendations and strategies to mitigate mishap risks exposed through
      operations or maintenance.
      5.6.2.3. A risk mitigation strategy approval by the appropriate Risk Acceptance
      Authority. Determine the appropriate Risk Acceptance Authority using the highest
      mishap category of the initial risks (while recommended actions are being incorporated
      into the design) and residual risks (after all recommended actions have been
      incorporated). Refer to MIL-STD-882D and to DoDI 5000.02 to determine the required
      mishap Risk Acceptance Authority.
   5.6.3. The PM will submit the operational necessity, the scope of intended use, and the
   period of time required to be excluded from the normal Certification/Test Approval process.
   5.6.4. If approved, AFSC/SEW will provide documentation with the risk assessment to the
   PM. During the risk assessment period, data should be collected on safety related operational
   deficiencies and potential system improvements.

                        INCORPORATION OF DESIGN SAFETY

6.1. Munitions Design Safety Standards and Criteria.
   6.1.1. Mandatory design safety standards for all munitions will be submitted to the NNMSB
   for HAF approval.
   6.1.2. Munitions design safety standards will incorporate a life cycle approach to ensure
   munitions can be safely handled, stored, and operated in all environments the items can
   reasonably be expected to experience throughout its life cycle. In addition, ensure munitions
   meet the requirements of Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO)
   certification.
   6.1.3. Munitions design safety standards must be given equal consideration along with
   logistics and operational requirements.
   6.1.4. Design safety standards have been developed for certain types of munitions or
   components and must be followed. See Attachment 3 for examples of applicable standards.
6.2. Munitions Design Safety Deviations.
   6.2.1. Deviations from munitions design safety standards are authorized only with the
   NNMSB’s recommendation and concurrence of AFSC/SEW.
   6.2.2. Deviations from munitions design safety standards will not be considered unless
   alternative design concepts or procedures are provided, with the concurrence of the NNMSB,
   and meet the intent of the applicable standard.
   6.2.3. When munitions design safety deviation is either recommended or not recommended
   by the NNMSB and approved by AFSC/SEW, the applicable staff agency is the final
   approval or disapproval authority pending discussion with the NNMSB and review of the
   associated NMMSB documentation.
AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013                                                          19

                           ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

7.1. Administrative Procedures.
   7.1.1. Meeting Frequency. Normally, meetings of the NNMSB are held semi-annually.
   Special meetings may be called to support time-critical acquisition program activities.
   Meetings of the NNMSB will be scheduled only by the chairperson or his/her representative;
   generally not to exceed once each quarter. The Chairperson will decide on a case-by-case
   basis if the amount of NNMSB business warrants scheduling additional meetings. In
   addition to these regular NNMSB meetings, special meetings may be held when required to
   support time-critical munitions development program milestones.
   7.1.2. The NNMSB (members and advisory personnel) will meet in formal session when
   called by the chairperson, or designated acting chairperson.
   7.1.3. The Executive Secretary provides meeting notification at least 30 days in advance of a
   regularly scheduled meeting date.
   7.1.4. If a quorum member is not represented and proxy is unavailable, the Chairperson
   determines if the meeting will proceed with available members.
   7.1.5. For special meetings the Executive Secretary informs the requesting agency that
   funding of the Board members’ and Chairperson’s travel expenses will be a condition for
   conducting the special meeting. The Executive Secretary polls members as to their
   availability before final special meeting dates are established.
7.2. Protocol.
   7.2.1. Members will make a concerted effort to reach unanimous agreement for each matter
   requiring a Board position.
   7.2.2. When unanimous agreement is not possible, the majority position is established by
   open ballot of the members.
   7.2.3. The Chairperson casts a vote only when a ballot of the members present (including
   proxy votes) results in a tie.
   7.2.4. Members representing the minority position may, at their discretion, prepare a
   minority report for inclusion in the official meeting minutes.
7.3. Presentations.
   7.3.1. Normally all items appearing in an NNMSB meeting agenda will be supported by a
   structured presentation. The presentation is intended to answer questions arising during
   documentation review and to stimulate detailed discussions.
   7.3.2. Agencies preparing NNMSB presentations should ensure essential supporting
   personnel (e.g., AF program management authorities, contractor representatives, etc.) are
   present to participate as needed during the presentation and discussions.
   7.3.3. The Executive Secretary provides appropriate guidance to agencies charged with
   preparing and delivering NNMSB presentations.
 20                                             AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013


7.4. NNMSB Requirements.
   7.4.1. During a formal session, complete a comprehensive review of any TMSS, MSA, or
   THAR presented for developmental, prototype, and existing nonnuclear munitions and
   associated support equipment.
      7.4.1.1. Reviews consider related issues such as the potential requirement for shields and
      barricades during electrical testing, the safety adequacy of packaging concepts, the
      availability of required technical data, and EOD procedures.
      7.4.1.2. Identify areas of design safety deficiency relative to items under review. Specify
      conditions for certification when such deficiencies are noted.
   7.4.2. Develop or review design safety standards, and recommend the adoption for AF use as
   appropriate.
   7.4.3. Recommend policies, controls, and procedures to minimize hazards during nonnuclear
   munitions operations.
   7.4.4. Charter special projects and ad hoc groups, as required.
7.5. Meeting Minutes, Studies, and Board Actions.
   7.5.1. Minutes. For each meeting, document NNMSB proceedings with a comprehensive set
   of minutes. For each item under review, the minutes (and the TMSS or MSA as necessary)
   will include applicable findings, recommendations, and required additional actions. In
   addition, the Chairperson designates a primary action agency for items under review.
      7.5.1.1. NNMSB minutes certify munitions studied are acceptable or not acceptable for
      further testing or use from a design safety viewpoint. When the minutes are signed by
      each member and approved by the Chairperson, they become the official NNMSB
      position. If unanimity cannot be achieved, minority reports may be prepared by the
      dissenting members and made a part of the official minutes.
      7.5.1.2. NNMSB meeting minutes constitute interim fulfillment of approval/certification
      of munitions requirements and grant interim safety approval or certification for
      nonnuclear munitions or related items. If a staff agency disagrees with meeting minutes,
      AFSC/SEW will notify applicable commanders of disapproval and/or subsequent
      modification, if required, of interim approval or certification.
      7.5.1.3. Commanders may proceed with munitions operations                      based    on
      recommendations in NNMSB meeting minutes, pending HAF concurrence.
      7.5.1.4. The Executive Secretary finalizes meeting minutes and updates TMSSs
      (amended to include NNMSB findings and recommendations). Also, the Executive
      Secretary submits the entire report to AFSC/SEW to initiate the AF/SE and AF staff
      agency approval process.
      7.5.1.5. Signed NNMSB minutes and TMSS, with relevant findings and
      recommendations, are forwarded to AFSC/SEW, 9700 G Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM
      87117-5670. AFSC/SEW acts as the coordinating agency to obtain staff agency review
      and approval.
AFI91-205_EGLINAFBSUP_I 13 MAY 2013                                                           21


       7.5.1.6. As appropriate, the Executive Secretary notifies program management
       authorities, test organizations, and unit commanders to proceed with planned activities
       and operations based on NNMSB’s recommendations. If a staff agency disapproves a
       NNMSB recommendation, the Executive Secretary will notify concerned agencies of the
       change in certification status.
   7.5.2. Studies. Once notified of AF/SE approval of a TMSS, the Executive Secretary
   publishes the report in its final version and distributes it to NNMSB members and associates,
   agencies responsible for implementing NNMSB recommendations, and other interested
   organizations.
       7.5.2.1. Approval of a recommendation to develop or modify a system signifies staff
       agency awareness that such action would be desirable from a safety viewpoint. It does
       not mean that such an action will be officially proposed, initiated, or funded by a staff
       agency as a direct result of the recommendation. This is the primary responsibility of the
       action agency.
       7.5.2.2. After a study is approved by HAF, the NNMSB’s recommendations (as
       documented in the meeting minutes) are directive on the designated action agency. The
       action agency initiates and monitors action on the recommendations and makes periodic
       status reports to the Executive Secretary of the NNMSB until final action item closeout.
   7.5.3. Action Items. Once NNMSB meeting minutes are approved by HAF, actions to
   implement Board recommendations are monitored until completion. Action items will be
   tracked until closure.
       7.5.3.1. The Executive Secretary periodically requests action item completion status
       reports from designated action agencies.
       7.5.3.2. The Executive Secretary arranges for action item status reports at each regularly
       scheduled NNMSB meeting.
       7.5.3.3. The NNMSB determines when a recommended action item has been
       successfully completed.
       7.5.3.4. The NNMSB may delegate to the Executive Secretary the authority to close
       purely administrative action items or to close a given action item upon the completion of
       a specific event (for example, the publication of a technical order).
       7.5.3.5. When all action items related to munitions certification have been closed, final
       certification of a munitions item is granted. Final certification is documented in the
       minutes of the NNMSB meeting effecting closure.
7.6. Partnering Staff Agencies.
   7.6.1. The following staff agencies will receive informational copies of NNMSB actions.
   These offices include the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the AF for Acquisition,
   Director of Global Power, SAF/AQPM; the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the AF for
   Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health, SAF/IEE; the AF Director of Logistics,
   Deputy Chief of Staff/Logistics, Installations and Mission Support (Integrated Life Cycle

  Division), AF/A4LW; and the AF Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans, and
  Requirements, Directorate for Force Application, AF/A5R-C.
  7.6.2. These agencies must respond to AFSC/SEW within 30 calendar days indicating their
  concurrence or non-concurrence with NNMSB findings and recommendations. No response
  within the prescribed 30 day period constitutes approval.
7.7. AFSC/SEW.
  7.7.1. Serves as technical lead for resolving any issues arising during staff agency
  coordination of the studies.
  7.7.2. Upon receipt of concurrences or successful resolution of non-concurrences, submits
  TMSS to AF/SE for approval and forwards signed approvals to the Executive Secretary. In
  addition, minutes are provided to AF/SE for review.
  7.7.3. Acts as approval authority for requests to deviate from mandatory design
  requirements.
  7.7.4. Reports unfavorable mishap trends identified for munitions previously certified by the
  NNMSB that may require reevaluation by the NNMSB.
  7.7.5. Appoints voting members of the IMTWG to include, as a minimum, a Chairperson, a
  AFSC/SEW member, and the Executive Secretary from the NNMSB.
7.8. HQ AFMC/SEW.
  7.8.1. Designates an Executive Secretary of the NNMSB, a NNMSB member, and an
  engineering support function responsible for conducting NNMSB studies and analyses.
7.9. Other Commands. HQ ACC, HQ AETC, HQ AFGSC, HQ AFSOC, HQ AFSPC, HQ
