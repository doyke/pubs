                                          Chapter 1

                   AIR NATIONAL GUARD CORPORATE PROCESS

1.1. The ANG Corporate Process (ANG CP). The ANG Corporate Process (ANG CP) is the
process for identifying, developing and prioritizing funding options to provide well-coordinated
resource allocation recommendations to the Director, Air National Guard (DANG), during
execution years, budget years and across the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). The purpose
of the ANG CP for Programming is to validate and prioritize requirements for funding within
fiscal constraints across the FYDP. The purpose of the ANG CP for Budget Execution is to
facilitate decision making regarding current fiscal year budget matters.
1.2. The ANG CP supports the National Guard Bureau’s (NGB). The ANG CP supports the
National Guard Bureau’s (NGB) legal purpose of serving as a channel of communication
between the Department of the Air Force and the states (10 USC 10501.b) for planning and
administering the budget of the Air National Guard (ANG) (10 USC 10503.6 and DoDD 5105.77
(NGB)).
1.3. The ANG CP uses the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
(PPBE). The ANG CP uses the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE)
process to plan and administer the budget of the ANG. PPBE is an Office of the Secretary of
Defense (OSD) process, established by Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 7045.14 and
Management Initiative Decision (MID) 913, and implemented by AF Policy Directive (AFPD)
16-5, AFI 16-501 and AFI 65-601. The PPBE process is designed to produce a DoD budget for
the President of the United States (POTUS) for submission to Congress.
1.4. The ANG CP is a dual-track process. The ANG CP is a dual-track process with one track
addressing planning and programming issues within the FYDP and a second track addressing
current fiscal year budget and execution issues. NGB/A8 is responsible for leading
programmatic issues while NGB/FM is the lead for budget execution year issues. NGB/A8 is
responsible for managing the overall ANG CP regardless of which directorate leads the
discussion.
1.5. NGB/A8Y is responsible for leading the program integration process. Integration is
achieved by ensuring the ANG POM (Program Objective Memorandum) is coordinated with
ANG and NGB Senior Leaders and submitted to Headquarters Air Force (HAF) A8 staff within
all deadlines. NGB/A8Y develops ANG CP timelines to meet HAF deadlines, integrates all
ANG Panel products into a single ANG programmatic position, facilitates ANG CP for
programmatic meetings and ensures Senior Leader vector checks are accomplished.
Additionally, NGB/A8Y is the focal point for interaction with the HAF/A8PE “Engine Room.”
All of these actions ensure the ANG submits a fully coordinated POM that complies with
Strategic Guidance and facilitates the ANG’s ability to shift funding from lower priority
missions to higher priority missions.

                                        Chapter 2

        AIR NATIONAL GUARD CORPORATE PROCESS—PROGRAMMING

2.1. The ANG CP for Programming. The ANG CP for Programming is a sequential process
for managing and vetting proposed changes to ANG programs via three decisional bodies: the
ANG Intermediate Level Review (ILR), the ANG Board and the ANG Council. The ANG CP is
designed to deliberate proposed programmatic changes and arrive at a final ANG POM for
submission to HAF. The ANG CP for Programming follows a sequential timeline (often called a
“Snakechart”), which is developed annually by NGB/A8Y.

Figure 2.1. The ANG CP – Programmatic Timeline (example).




2.2. ANG CP Programmatic Timeline (Snakechart). Figure 2.1 is an example of the ANG
CP Programmatic Timeline (Snakechart). The timeline is driven by date of POM submission by
Major Commands (MAJCOM) as directed by HAF. The ANG is considered a MAJCOM for
programmatic purposes. The ANG CP Timeline is divided into the following five phases
separated by the vertical lines on the timeline:
 6                                                        ANGI16-501 19 NOVEMBER 2014


Table 2.1. The ANG CP Timeline Five Phases.
           I        Training and Program Analysis
               II   Strategic Guidance
     III            Option Development
     IV             Deliberation and POM Development
     V              Senior Leader POM Review and Submission
     2.2.1. The ANG CP Timeline illustrates several opportunities for field-driven strategic
     inputs to ANG strategic direction. The Strategic Planning System (SPS), Guard Senior
     Leadership Conference (GSLC) and Senior Leadership Conference (SLC) are forums for
     ANG unit leaders to provide inputs to ANG POM development.
     2.2.2. Two tasks shown on the ANG timeline are external to NGB/A8.
           2.2.2.1. Core Function Leads (CFL) will coordinate changes to Core Function Support
           Plans (CFSP) with respective stakeholders, including the ANG. NGB/A8X coordinates
           the CFSP Scrub and informs the ANG CP of any change affecting ANG equities. In
           addition, CFL and HAF require a thorough briefing on ANG Programs from the Program
           Element Monitors (PEMs), termed “PEM Parades.”
           2.2.2.2. Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements are authored and
           periodically updated by parent MAJCOMs to define manning and resource requirements.
           NGB/A2, NGB/A3, NGB/A4, NGB/A6, NGB/A7 and NGB/SG are required to execute a
           DOC Statement Scrub to inform the ANG CP of any requirements change.
           2.2.2.3. NGB/A1M performs an annual “manpower scrub” to analyze present and future
           UTC and UMD status to inform the current POM build.
2.3. The Training and Program Analysis Phase. The Training and Program Analysis Phase
(see Figure 2.2) provides PEMs programmatic training from both AF/A8P and NGB/A8YI. The
training prepares PEMs for program analysis and provides instruction on various IT programs
critical for POM development.
ANGI16-501 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                7


Figure 2.2. The ANG CP – Training and Program Analysis Phase.




   2.3.1. There are several levels of required training that must be accomplished at specific
   times in the program cycle.
      2.3.1.1. Air Force PEM training consists of three courses: PPBE, Automated Budget
      Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and Resource Allocation Programming
      Information Decision System (RAPIDS). PPBE training is critical to understand the
      entire FYDP development process. ABIDES and RAPIDS training enables PEMs to
      become proficient on the two software programs most often used during the ANG POM
      build. PPBE, ABIDES and RAPIDS training should be scheduled as soon as a new PEM
      is assigned. Registration for the training is available on the Air Force Portal, AF/A8P
      homepage. NGB/A8YI is the POC for Air Force PEM training.
      2.3.1.2. NGB/A8YI leads PEM training for all ANG PEMs. The training focuses on the
      PEM’s role in the ANG POM build. Additional training is provided on developing
      common ABIDES reports and using RAPIDS products for option development. ANG
      training is accomplished annually during the August/September timeframe.
   2.3.2. Program analysis is executed by PEMs with inputs from NGB/A1, NGB/A2,
   NGB/A3, NGB/A4, NGB/A6, NGB/A7, NGB/SG, NGB/A8X and the Execution Year
   Working Group (EYWG).
      2.3.2.1. PEMs are the Subject Matter Experts (SME) on their respective programs. The
      most critical knowledge includes the requirements and funding levels of assigned
      program’s manpower, Operations and Maintenance (O&M), aircraft, flying hour and
      infrastructure requirements. PEMs are responsible for identifying and providing
      recommendations for correcting any errors or deficiencies impacting the execution of
      programs. Other required knowledge includes National Guard and Reserve Equipment
      Appropriations (NGREA) and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds impacting
      assigned programs.
 8                                                        ANGI16-501 19 NOVEMBER 2014


        2.3.2.2. NGB/A1 assists PEMs by providing Unit Manning Document (UMD)
        information for detailed manpower analysis by the PEMs.
        2.3.2.3. NGB/A2, NGB/A3, NGB/A4, NGB/A6, NGB/A7 and NGB/SG provide PEMs
        with UTC (Unit Type Code) and DOC assistance.
        2.3.2.4. NGB/A8X is responsible for coordinating CFSPs with the CFLs. During
        coordination, NGB/A8X will inform PEMs of CFSP highlights impacting their respective
        programs.
        2.3.2.5. The EYWG consists of representatives from NGB/A8 and NGB/FM. The
        EYWG informs PEMs of any O&M rebalancing efforts that may affect assigned
        programs. These efforts are designed to adjust O&M programming levels to more
        closely match the actual execution of the program.
     2.3.3. At the end of the Training and Program Analysis phase, ANG PEMS should be
     knowledgeable of the PPBE process, capable of using ABIDES and RAPIDS and intimately
     familiar with their programs. Additionally, DOC statements should be current, requirements
     for each program known, and potential programming changes identified.
2.4. The Strategic Guidance Phase. The Strategic Guidance Phase informs the priorities for
each POM. The ANG CP considers options based on National Security Strategy (NSS), National
Defense Strategy (NDS), National Military Strategy (NMS), Quadrennial Defense Review
(QDR), Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), Defense Planning and Programming Guidance
(DPPG), Air Force Programming Guidance and the Director, Air National Guard Planning and
Programming Guidance. In addition, the ANG considers inputs from CNGB Programming
Priorities and SPS inputs to the DPPG. Most important to the ANG CP are the Chief, National
Guard Bureau (CNGB) inputs and DPPG. The purple boxes in Figure 2.3 represent strategic
guidance to the ANG CP for Programming. The SLC and GSLC affords an avenue for the field
to provide input the POM build, while vector checks provide CNGB opportunities to adjust ANG
POM priorities in order to meet CNGB’s intent.

Figure 2.3. The ANG CP – Strategic Guidance Phase.




     2.4.1. The CNGB provides specific inputs to the ANG CP for deliberation. These inputs are
     in the form of CNGB Programming Priorities.
ANGI16-501 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  9


   2.4.2. The DPPG shapes priorities for the ANG POM build and is informed by CNGB’s and
   DANG’s Strategic Priorities. NGB/A8X is responsible for drafting the DPPG for DANG
   approval.
   2.4.3. The purpose of the ANG SPS is to incorporate strategic inputs into ANG POM
   development. The ANG SPS includes inputs external and internal to the ANG.
       2.4.3.1. The NSS, NDS, QDR and DSG are external strategic inputs at the DoD level or
       above, which impact AF and ANG strategic decisions. It is important that PEMs
       understand these documents in order to inform and justify option development.
       2.4.3.2. NGB/A8X works with the ANG SPS to develop tools that aid in the information
       sharing and communication process between the states and the Air National Guard
       Readiness Center (ANGRC). These tools enable states to plan for and communicate
       inputs on desired mission types and present initiatives for consideration into the POM
       process. The Common Operating Picture and Requirements (CoPR) database provides a
       strategic toolbox and geographic information system of ANG capabilities. The Future
       Missions Database (FMD) is a transparent database for state planners to use as a tool to
       examine potential future missions by state and by unit capabilities. Finally, the ANG
       Initiatives website is the execution phase of TAG approved initiatives and is managed by
       NGB/A8F. ANG key leaders, strategic planners, programmers, PEMs, FAMs, and
       Career Field Managers (CFM) should be aware of all these tools and potential initiatives
       affecting their programs.
   2.4.4. The Strategic Guidance phase will ensure all ANG PEMS, Panel Chairs, EYWG and
   NGB/A8 Leadership are knowledgeable of applicable strategic guidance. Following this
   phase, all involved should understand how internal and external strategic guidance will
   impact potential adjustments to ANG programs.
2.5. The Option Development Phase. The Option Development Phase is the opportunity for
ANG Panels and PEMs to recommend adjustments to assigned programs (See Figure 2.4).
Program changes are typically developed at the panel level, however, the DANG, ANG Directors
and National Guard staff may recommend programmatic changes. ANG PEMs rely on the
assistance of Integrated Process Teams (IPT) to develop potential options.

Figure 2.4. The ANG CP – Option Development Phase.




   2.5.1. Program Element Monitors (PEMs) form the foundation of the ANG CP for
   Programming. PEMs perform ground-level research into issues preventing optimal program

  execution and formulate solutions through IPTs. The solutions take the form of program
  change options, which are validated by Panel Chairs and presented to the ANG CP for
  consideration.
  2.5.2. The Integrated Process Team (IPT) is a cross-functional body of SMEs designed to
  address specific missions or tasks. At a minimum, IPTs should meet on a bi-monthly basis.
  While IPTs are typically chaired by the PEM, it is not a requirement. Each Program Element
  (PE) should have an associated IPT and membership in the IPT should consist of all
  functionals associated with a program. An IPT is formed when specific requirements exist to
  either solve a specific problem, issue or deficiency, or to address the ongoing well-being of a
  program. For example, all major weapons systems in the ANG, such as the F-16 and C-130,
  will have a permanent IPT that meets regularly to discuss and propose solutions to issues
  related to the weapons system. Other IPTs will be short-lived in nature and may disband
  once the issue being addressed is resolved.
  2.5.3. ANG Panels are groupings of mission and mission support programs organized to
  correspond to the Air Force Panel structure. Each ANG program is part of an ANG Panel.
  ANG Panels inform the ANG CP by identifying, developing, and prioritizing disconnects
  (insufficient resources in an existing program), initiatives (new program or new mission
  stand-up within and existing program), and offsets (reducing resources from existing
  programs) within their area of expertise. The area of expertise includes both the assigned
  programs and assigned “cross-cutting” commodities or issues.

     2.5.3.2. ANG Panel Chairs are assigned to lead their respective Panel and are responsible
     for managing Panel assigned Programs. Panel Chairs have three major responsibilities:
        2.5.3.2.1. Preview options presentations to ensure they are validated requirements
        and ready for consideration by the ANG ILR. Prior to consideration, options should
        be fully and accurately priced, and will include a capabilities and risk assessment
        adequately supported by facts. Options briefings will include multiple Courses of
        Action (COAs) for the ANG ILR to deliberate.
        2.5.3.2.2. Integrate all Panel options into a single prioritized list from which the
        ANG ILR may begin its deliberation.
        2.5.3.2.3. Act as the primary advocate for options presented by his or her panel
        during ANG POM deliberations and represent ANG interests to the associated HAF
        Panel.
     2.5.3.3. ANG Panel meetings are chaired by NGB/A8Y and are used to coordinate panel
     chair efforts. Panel meetings provide a forum for Panel Chairs to coordinate on cross
     cutting options and other issues.
  2.5.4. Prior to option development, ANG PEMS are required to brief the ANG ILR on the
  programmatic details of assigned programs; these briefings are known as PEM Parades.
  PEM Parades serve two purposes. First, PEM Parades assist PEMs and the ANG ILR in
  gaining a thorough understanding of the programmatic details of ANG programs. Second,
  PEM Parades provide A8Y the opportunity to de-conflict with other program elements and
  become an advocate for the advancement of the program. PEM Parades should highlight
  current and future programmatic funding issues for consideration in option development.
  2.5.5. PEMs, with the assistance of IPTs, will develop programming change options.
  RAPIDS slides provide the programmatic details required for option deliberation. Each
  option will have associated RAPIDS slides, facer, tri-chart and Bullet Background Paper
  (BBP).
  2.5.6. PEMS are responsible for developing MILCON advocacy slides to support required
  MILCON projects associated with their programs. These slides will be used when MILCON
  options are prioritized in the Air Force Corporate Process (AFCP).
  2.5.7. While the Panel Chairs and PEMS are developing options, the EYWG will propose
  options to bring O&M programming more in line with O&M execution. These options must
  zero balance (O&M initiatives must equal O&M offsets). EYWG options are due at the
  same time as panel options.
  2.5.8. NGB/A1MP will validate all manpower end-strength adjustments and NGB/FMAF
  will validate all manpower dollar adjustments for options presented during ANG CP
  deliberations.
  2.5.9. At the end of the option development phase, all Panels Chairs and EYWG will
  forward RAPIDS options to NGB/A8YI for compilation. Once all options are received, the
  master RAPIDS database, administered by NGB/A8YI will be “locked.”

2.6. The Deliberation and POM Development Phase. The Deliberation and POM
Development Phase is the process by which competing options are prioritized by the ANG ILR
and ANG Board to form a balanced ANG POM position (see Figure 2.5).

Figure 2.5. The ANG CP – Deliberation and POM Development Phase.




   2.6.1. The ANG ILR serves as the first level of cross-functional review in the ANG CP. The
   ANG ILR consists of deputy/associate directorate level GS-14/15s, O-5s or O-6s. The ANG
   ILR reviews resource allocation recommendations presented by panels and then “racks and
   stacks” options to formulate a “1-N” list. The ANG ILR forwards the 1-N list and
   recommendations to the ANG Board.
      2.6.1.1. The ANG ILR is chaired by the NGB/A8 Deputy Director and facilitated by the
      Program Integration Division Chief, NGB/A8Y. In the absence of the NGB/A8 Deputy
      Director, the NGB/A8 Associate Director or NGB/A8Y will chair the ANG ILR. The
      ANGRC/CV serves as an advisor to the ANG ILR, providing a senior leader perspective.
      2.6.1.2. ANG ILR membership includes one individual from each of the following
      organizations:
          2.6.1.2.1. The deputy directors (or assigned alternates) for A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6,
          A7, A8, FM and SG are voting members of the ANG ILR. The deputy/associate
          directors’ are responsible for considering implications of proposed options to their
          respective Directorate and informing their ANG Board primaries.
          2.6.1.2.2. Support function members should advise deputy/associate directors on
          options impacting their respective functional areas.
          2.6.1.2.3. MAJCOM Guard Advisors from ACC, AFMC, AFSPC, AMC, AFGSC,
          AFRC, AETC and AFSOC should advise the ANG ILR on issues pertaining to their
          respective MAJCOM.
          2.6.1.2.4. Advisory members include Panel Chairs, A6X, A8X, A8P, A8F, A8YI,
          A1M, A1X, A3X, A4P, A7S and NGB/LL. Advisory members may provide relevant
          material to assist ANG ILR members in fully understanding options being considered.
ANGI16-501 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 13


     2.6.1.3. Options presented to the ANG ILR will be vetted and then placed up for vote. A
     simple majority of all voting members present will be used to forward issues to the ANG
     Board for consideration. In the event of a tie, the ANG ILR Chair will be the tie-breaker.
  2.6.2. The ANG Board. The ANG Board is the senior cross-functional review body in the
  ANG CP. The ANG Board consists of directorate level GS-14/15s and O-6s/O-7s. The
  ANG Board reviews resource allocation recommendations offered by the ANG ILR and
  provides final recommendations to the ANG Council.
     2.6.2.1. The ANG Board is chaired by the ANGRC/CC and facilitated by NGB/A8. In
     the absence of the ANGRC/CC and NGB/A8, the NGB/A8 Deputy Director or NGB/A8
     Associate Director will preside over the ANG Board.
     2.6.2.2. ANG Board membership includes one individual from each of the following
     organizations:
        2.6.2.2.1. The directors (or assigned alternate) for A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8,
        FM and SG are a voting member of the ANG Board. The director, or designated
        representative, is responsible for considering implications of a proposed option to
        their respective directorates.
        2.6.2.2.2. Support Function members (IA, IG, JA, PA, HC, HR and SE) should
        advise directorates on issues impacting their respective functional areas.
        2.6.2.2.3. MAJCOM Guard Advisors from ACC, AFMC, AFSPC, AMC, AFGSC,
        AFRC, AETC and AFSOC should advise the ANG Board on options pertaining to
        their respective MAJCOM.
        2.6.2.2.4. Advisory members include Panel Chairs, A6X, A8X, A8P, A8F, A8YI,
        A1M, A1X, A3X, A4P, A7S, NGB/LL and NG-J8-PB or other as deemed required by
        NGB/A8. Advisory members may provide relevant material to assist directorates in
        fully understanding options being considered.
        2.6.2.2.5. Options presented to the ANG Board will be vetted and then placed up for
        vote. A simple majority of all present voting members will decide options adopted by
        the ANG Board. In the event of a tie, the ANG Board Chair will serve as the tie-
        breaker.
  2.6.3. The conclusion of the deliberation and POM development phase will produce an ANG
  Board approved, balanced ANG POM recommendation ready for ANG Council approval.
  The ANGRC/CC or the ANG Board may request the ANG ILR or on short notice NGB/A8,
  to present alternative COAs.

Figure 2.6. The ANG CP – Senior Leader POM Review and Submission Phase.




2.7. The Senior Leader POM Review and Submission Phase. The Senior Leader POM
Review and Submission Phase is the final phase of the POM build. During this phase the ANG
Council reviews the recommendations of the ANG Board (See Figure 2.6). ANG Council
membership consists of the DANG, Deputy Director, Air National Guard (DDANG), Executive
Director, Air National Guard (EDANG) and ANGRC/CC, and is facilitated by NGB/A8. The
DANG chairs the ANG Council and is the final decision authority for matters vetted by the ANG
CP. The ANG Council will weigh ANG Board POM recommendations and may consider other
factors not considered by the ANG Board. In addition to receiving recommendations from the
ANG Board, the ANG Council receives inputs from the CNGB, the SPS and The Adjutant
Generals (TAGs). ANG Council decisions will be implemented by the ANG either at the
directorate level or, in the case of Program Objective Memorandum (POM) decisions, forwarded
to the AFCP for consideration in the Air Force POM.

                                         Chapter 3

     AIR NATIONAL GUARD CORPORATE PROCESS—BUDGET EXECUTION

3.1. The ANG CP for Budget Execution. The ANG CP for Budget Execution is similar to the
ANG CP for Programming. However, while the ANG CP for Programming deals with the future
year programming in the FYDP, the ANG CP for Budget Execution deals with corporate
decision making on current fiscal year budget issues. The process from top down includes the
DANG, ANG Board, ANG ILR, FAWG, and the Commodity Level IPTs/Working Groups
(CWGs).
3.2. For budget execution issues. For budget execution issues during the execution year, the
various Commodity specific CWGs should: determine the funding levels; shortfalls; impacts of
shortfalls; articulate requirements; and propose COAs. The COAs will be forwarded through the
Commodity Manager/FM Analyst through the ANG CP for further integration. CWGs are
chaired by the commodity manager, and attended by the appropriation execution manager,
resource advisors, and pertinent stakeholders.
   3.2.1. The Appropriation Execution Manager (AEM) is responsible for providing oversight
   and direction to the CWG, including funding levels and ground rules. The AEM acts as the
   primary liaison for up channeling conflicts within the process.
   3.2.2. Commodity Managers (CM) are appointed by the lead directorate for a particular
   commodity. These commodities include: Civilian Pay; Weapon System Sustainment;
   Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization; Flying Hour Program; Security Agreements;
   Recruiting/Advertising; Travel; Non-Fly Depot Level Repairables; Base Operating Costs;
   Facilities, Operations, Maintenance Agreements; Medical; Support Equipment;
   Transportation; and other sub commodities (i.e., Joint Staff BOC).
       3.2.2.1. Commodity Manager Responsibilities include:
          3.2.2.1.1. Manage resources. Using Checkbook, the CM will receive funding from
          the AEM, and push it out to units and to directorate accounts to accomplish their
          mission. The CM is responsible for tracking execution and either fully utilizing
          resources or return balances to the AEM.
          3.2.2.1.2. Advise PEMs and NGB/FM of execution year issues impacting mission
          execution and recommend solutions.
          3.2.2.1.3. Maintain an unfunded requirements list (URL) for the assigned
          commodity.
          3.2.2.1.4. Bring execution year unfunded requirements forward to the CWG and
          Financial Analyst Working Group (FAWG).
   3.2.3. Resource Advisors are any analyst assigned to oversee and execute resources. They
   may be a PEM or assistant to a commodity manager.
   3.2.4. Stakeholders are any non-funding oriented advisor. This may include other
   commodity managers with relevant issues to resolve within another commodity, or non-FM
   directorate personnel providing guidance to the working group to aid in decision making.
   They are most often A1 and A3 personnel.

3.3. For execution year issues. For execution year issues, the Commodity Manager becomes
the advocate for the issue, and nominates the issue for consideration to the FAWG. The FAWG
is chaired by the relevant AEM (i.e., the O&M or MilPers AEM). Specific responsibilities of the
FAWG include the following: reviewing current execution; evaluating funding shortfalls and
requirements, and proposing COAs to resolve issues to be forwarded and presented to the ANG
ILR – Financials.
   3.3.1. The AEM is the chair for the FAWG. The AEM provides the status of funds and
   funding limitations to be evaluated by the FAWG. The AEM should preview COAs to
   ensure they are appropriate and address pertinent execution issues. Execution issues should
   include the impact of budget shortfalls and COAs previously staffed at the CWG level. The
   AEM will produce the briefing package to be presented to the FAWG, and update decisions
   made to the presentation for the ANG ILR–Financials.
   3.3.2. Commodity Manager responsibilities at the FAWG include: Advocating for their
   respective program, to include advising other CMs and NGB/FM of issues impacting mission
   execution; recommending solutions; maintaining a URL for the assigned commodity, and
   being a voting member to approve COAs for review by the ANG ILR-Financial.
3.4. The ANG ILR structure. The ANG ILR structure is outlined in detail in paragraph 2.6.
The ANG ILR is the first decision making body for budget execution issues. Differences
between the ANG ILR - Programming and ANG ILR-Financial (Budget Execution) are as
follows:
   3.4.1. The ANG ILR - Financial is Co-chaired by ANGRC/CV and the NGB/FM Deputy or
   the designated replacement. The recommendations from the FAWG are briefed by the Chief,
   Budget Execution Branch.
   3.4.2. ANG ILR - Financials membership consists of the same voting members as the ANG
   ILR’s for Programming, specifically:
       3.4.2.1. The Deputy (or designated representative) for each directorate (A1, A2, A3, A4,
       A5, A6, A7, A8, FM and SG) is a voting member of the ANG ILR. ANG ILR members
       are responsible for considering all implications of an issue short of the political.
       3.4.2.2. Deputy Secretariat members (IA, IG, JA, LL, PA, HR, HC and SE) should
       advise Deputy Directorates on issues impacting their respective representation.
       3.4.2.3. MAJCOM Guard Advisors from ACC, AFMC, AFSPC, AMC, AFGSC, AFRC,
       AETC and AFSOC should advise the ANG ILR on issues pertaining to their respective

       A3X, A7S, FMC and NGB-J8, as appropriate. Advisory members may provide relevant
       material to assist the deputy directors in fully understanding the issue(s) being
       considered.
   3.4.3. The issues presented to the ANG ILR - Financial for Budget Execution will be vetted
   and then placed up for vote. A simple majority of all present voting members will be counted
   for issues addressed by the ANG ILR. In the event of a tie, the ANG ILR Chair will be the
   tie-breaker. If approved, the decisions and recommendations, to include all dissenting

                 THE AIR FORCE CORPORATE STRUCTURE (AFCS)

4.1. The Air Force implements the PPBE process through the AFCS. Much like the ANG
CP, the goal of the AFCS is to offer a corporate perspective through the application of cross-
functional judgment, experience, and cost-benefit analysis. The primary purpose of the AFCS is
to develop resource allocation and prioritization recommendations for AF senior leadership to
enact program adjustments given current fiscal and programmatic guidance.
4.2. The ANG CP interfaces with the AFCS at multiple levels during POM development.
   4.2.1. The AFCS Panels are the Air Force centers of expertise for their portfolios and the
   first level of corporate deliberation in the AFCS. The Panels’ primary mission is to integrate
   input from multiple sources including CFL, MAJCOM, Air Reserve Component, HAF
   functional representatives, and other SMEs in order to prepare fact-based programming
   options that are repeatable, defendable and viable. The Panel structure is comprised of five
   Mission Panels and four Mission Support Panels. ANG panels are organized to parallel to
   Air Force Panel structure and ANG Panel Chairs interface with HAF counterparts to
   advocate for ANG Programs.
   4.2.2. The Intermediate Level Review (ILR), formerly known as the Air Force Group
   (AFG), provides senior-level leadership (O-6 and civilian equivalents) a forum for initial
   corporate review and evaluation of appropriate issues within the same broad categories as
   both the Air Force Board (AFB) and Air Force Council (AFC). The ILR is the first level of
   the AFCS that does detailed integration and programmatic assessment across Air Force
   Service Core Functions (SCF) to create a balanced Air Force program. Representatives are
   selected by their two-letter sponsors or AFB principal and are responsible for preparing their
   principals for AFB meetings. ILR representatives are expected to fully represent the equities
   of their respective function. Prior coordination with other agencies (i.e. other 3- or 4-digit
   offices) within their respective function will occur prior to ILR sessions in order to facilitate
   corporate decision-making. The Associate Director of Plans and Programs (NGB/A8),
   (Deputy Director of Plans and Programs is the designated alternate), is an Air Staff member
   of the ILR and advocates for the equities of the ANG.
   4.2.3. The AFB provides flag-level (1-2 star general officer and civilian equivalent) review,
   evaluation, and recommendations within the same broad categories as the AFC.
   Representatives are selected by their AFC principal and are responsible for preparing their
   principal for AFC meetings. AFB representatives are expected to fully represent the equities
   of their respective function; prior coordination with other agencies (i.e., other 3-digit
   directorates) within their respective function should occur prior to AFB sessions in order to
   facilitate corporate decision-making. The Deputy Director of the Air National Guard
   (Director of Plans and Programs is the designated alternate) is an Air Staff member of the
   AFB and advocates for the equities of the ANG.
   4.2.4. The AFC is the senior forum for cross-functional consideration of the most critical Air
   Force issues. The AFC reviews and evaluates Air Force objectives, policies, plans, programs,
   budgets, and studies to make timely recommendations to the Secretary of the Air Force
   (SECAF) and CSAF. The AFC also provides expeditious HAF (Secretariat and Air Staff)
 20                                                      ANGI16-501 19 NOVEMBER 2014


   two-letter/digit coordination on significant, urgent, and complex issues to ensure Air Force
   plans, policies, and programs comply with Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), OSD, and national
   objectives. The DANG is an Air Staff member of the AFC representing the equities of the
   ANG.

                                          Chapter 5

    OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PROGRAM AND BUDGET REVIEW

5.1. Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program and Budget Review (PBR). Office of
Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program and Budget Review (PBR) is the formal process which
integrates the service POM/ Budget Estimate Submissions (BES) submissions into the final
Defense Budget sent to the President. PBR typically starts after the Services submit their
POM/BES and runs until December. PBR allows the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) to adjust
service POM submissions by inserting funding for requirements which are either underfunded or
not funded at all. The SecDef can also direct the services to cancel or adjust programs to meet
the overall SecDef direction. PBR also involves review of Service Budget submissions focusing
on proper pricing, reasonableness, and program execution. Final OSD changes to either the
service POM submissions or their corresponding BES are combined into documents called
Resource Management Decisions (RMDs) which direct service adjustments to their POM/BES.
After all RMD actions are accomplished by the services, the final DoD Budget becomes the
President’s Budget (PB) and is submitted to the President for review. While the National
Guard’s participation in PBR is led by the National Guard Joint Staff (J8), certain members of
the ANG staff are involved in the PBR process. This chapter will provide a general overview of
the PBR process and more specific instructions on ANG involvement in the PBR process. The
OSD, Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (D-CAPE) and the OSD
Comptroller (OSD-C) review the service POM submissions
5.2. PBR begins before the services have submitted their POM/BES to OSD. D-CAPE and
OSD-C both identify specific areas to study during PBR and both perform front end assessments
(FEAs) on those topics prior to service POM submissions. The FEAs may or may not include
NGB/ANG participants depending on the topic under review. FEAs will drive some of the
specific issues D-CAPE and OSD-C will focus on during PBR. During the OSD FEA process,
ANG members normally have little to no interaction with D-CAPE and OSD-C.
   5.2.1. Additionally, strategic portfolio reviews (SPR) may be conducted on specific topics as
   directed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). SPRs will generally drive
   specific themes for enhanced consideration throughout the PBR process.
5.3. Either via SPRs or FEAs, OSD will identify issues. Either via SPRs or FEAs, OSD will
identify issues that re quire further investigation during PBR to become issue papers. Issue
papers identify program shortfalls (manpower, acquisition, funding, etc.) that will be closely
studied by issue team members as part of PBR. Issue papers may also be submitted by the OSD
Policy, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics
(OUSD AT&L), Services, Combatant Commanders, Defense Agencies and NGB/J8. Budget
issue papers are reviewed directly by OSD-C and are either approved for funding adjustments or
denied. POM issue papers are reviewed by OSD-CAPE, in conjunction with OSD Policy and
OUSD AT&L. Issue papers may be tiered by the DEPSECDEF for review and appropriate focus
of effort. If the issue paper is approved by OSD-CAPE, it moves on in the PBR process to the
Issue Team for in-depth analysis. Although NGB/J8 is responsible for submitting issue papers to
OSD, ANG is also involved in two ways. First, ANG PEMS and Panel Chairs may identify
issues for potential issue paper nomination. More commonly, ANG issues are decided by the
DANG or DDANG and then it is up to the appropriate PEM to develop the specific issue paper
 22                                                         ANGI16-501 19 NOVEMBER 2014


for coordination through the A-Staff. Second and more often, is the role of coordination on
NGB/J8 issue paper nominations. All issue papers from the NGB/J8 will go through several
rounds of coordination prior to being approved for submission by the Chief, National Guard
Bureau. Once issue papers are submitted to OSD, NGB-J8 will notify the Joint, Army and Air
Staff of the issue papers accepted by OSD-CAPE or OSD-C for further investigation during the
PBR process.
5.4. PBR Issue Teams. PBR Issue Teams are assigned the task of investigating the merits of
issue papers and forwarding recommendations for each Issue to the 3-Star Programmers. OSD
sets up multiple Issue Teams based on the issues to be investigated. Typical issue teams include:
building partnership capacity, command & control, communication, cyber, efficiency, global
posture, ground forces, homeland defense, installations, ISR, manpower, Major Defense
Acquisition Program (MDAP), missile defense, mobility, naval forces, science & technology,
space, special operations forces, strategic offense, and tactical air (TACAIR). NGB-J8 is
responsible for creating an issue team representative list which identifies a primary and alternate
for each issue team requiring National Guard representation. Issue team representatives will be
selected from the Joint, Army and Air Staffs as appropriate. The issue team’s primary
representative should be an O-6 or equivalent (Note: Most issue teams will not allow civilian
contractors to attend issue team meetings and they may never represent the NGB). The alternate
issue team representative should also be an O-6, but O-5 is acceptable. The issue team is led by
an OSD-CAPE member. Other issue team members come from the different Service staffs,
COCOM (Combatant Command) staffs, and members of the CJCS (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
Staff) Joint Staff. ANG issue team representatives have a unique responsibility. On most issues,
ANG issue team representatives will support the Air Force POM position. However, when Issue
Team discussions or course of actions (COA) negatively impact the ANG, it is the Issue Team’s
responsibility to voice a coherent argument against the COA. While the ANG representative
may be the only one who disagrees with the COA, it is important to voice any concerns since the
issue team representative directly represents the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. By
speaking up, the issue team representative is voicing the Chief’s non-concurrence with the COA.
Regardless of the content of the Issue Team discussions, issue team representatives are
responsible for writing an executive summary (EXSUM) after each issue team meeting which
highlights the keys points and states any potential impact to the ANG. NGB-J8 will send out the
EXSUM format to each Issue Team representative and alternate at the beginning of each PBR
cycle. EXSUMs with ANG equity will be sent to NGB/A8 for action. These EXSUMs are
compiled by NGB-J8 and distributed on a weekly basis to all Joint Staff, Army and Air Guard
General Officers. After each issue team analyzes their issue papers, the issue will either be
disapproved or approved. If approved, COAs will be recommended to the next level in the PBR
process, the 3-Star Programmers.
5.5. 3-Star Programmers. The 3-Star Programmers are responsible for debating COAs
presented by the Issue Team Chairs and making recommendations to the Deputy’s Management
Action Group (DMAG). The 3-Star Programmers consist of the Service Programmers, COCOM
Deputies (if required), Joint Staff Directors, Defense Agency Deputies and the National Guard
Comptroller or designated replacement. The 3-Star Programmer Chair is the Director, OSD-
CAPE. Issues making it out of the Issue Teams are presented to the 3-Star Programmers.
Typical recommendations by the 3-Star programmers are the following: forward to DMAG with
recommended COA, direct Issue Teams to develop additional COAs, or disapprove the issue.
ANGI16-501 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   23


The National Guard representative to the 3-Star Programmers will be pre-briefed on all the issues
to be covered during the meeting by the corresponding NGB Issue Team representative. After
the 3-Star Programmer meeting is complete, the attendee will forward an EXSUM to all Joint
Staff, Army and Air Guard General Officers.
5.6. The DMAG. The DMAG is the senior level review Group in the PBR process. The
DMAG is chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense while the Vice Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff acts as the vice-chair. DMAG membership is listed in DoDD 5105.79, Enclosure
4. Members of the DMAG provide advice and recommendations to the Deputy SecDef on
budgetary issues. The Chief, National Guard Bureau is a member of the DMAG. As such,
CNGB will be prepped prior to each DMAG meeting either by the Senior NGB Leader who
attended the 3-Star Programmers or the Issue Team Lead.
5.7. The final PBR decisions. The final PBR decisions are published in a classified document
called a Resource Management Directive (RMD). Each POM cycle may have one or more
RMDs. Once the RMD is published, Services normally have twenty-four hours to reclama items
on the RMD. Most reclama attempts are not approved unless there is an obvious mistake. The
RMD is Service specific in that it will direct a Service to fund an issue at a specific amount.
However, the RMD doesn’t always direct where funding should be taken from to pay for the
directed issue. Because the Services don’t know what their RMD “bill” will be, they develop a
war chest of offset options they can tailor to pay for their respective RMD funding requirements.
This war chest may contain options which negatively impact the ANG. As such, it is the PEM
and Panel chair’s responsibility to know all the options on the war chest and make leadership
aware of them. After all RMD actions have been laid into the budget, the Service POMs become
the DoD President’s Budget and is sent to the White House for review.
5.8. After the President’s review. After the President’s review of the PB, the PB is submitted
to Congress in the form of Justification Books (J-Books). J-Books are developed by NGB/FM
with details provided by the PEMs after the ANG POM is submitted to the Air Force. After the
RMD(s) adjust the POM, J-Books are updated to reflect changes caused by the RMD(s). JBooks
explain to Congress exactly what changes to the budget were made in the PB. All program
growth must be fully justified, and accuracy is paramount. Once the J-Books complete a Security
Review, the budget is ready for presentation to Congress in early February. Presentation to
Congress is done through press conferences and “staffer days” when the members of key
committees in the House and Senate visit HQ USAF for briefings and discussion on the PB.

                                            Chapter 6

            CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION AND APPROPRIATIONS

6.1. After the President’s Budget (PB). After the President’s Budget (PB) is sent to Congress
in February, Congress begins a long and detailed review of the PB. The process includes
hearings and testimony from the Service Chiefs, Chief of the National Guard Bureau and
Director of the Air National Guard. Also, multiple questions from the Senate and House will be
sent to the Air Staff for official response. The end result will be an Authorization Bill and
Appropriations Bill, both of which will eventually be signed into law by the President.
   6.1.1. The Authorization Bill, when signed by the President, allows Congress to fund those
   items approved by Congress in the Bill. The Authorizations Bill is the “what to fund.” The
   Appropriations Bill is the “how much to fund.” NGB/LL is the National Guard Bureau’s
   primary source for tracking and posting the Defense Authorization and Appropriation Bills as
   they make their way through the Legislative Process. The NGB/LL website is found at the
   link, http://www.ng.mil/ll/default.aspx.
   6.1.2. The Appropriations Bill is the legislation that appropriates funding to the
   Congressional Authorizations. As such, the Appropriation Bill is important for a PEM to
   monitor as it determines whether or not options approved by the DoD and Congress are
   funded to the level needed. If not, another option may be required in subsequent POMs.
6.2. Once the Senate and House approve the Defense Bill. Once the Senate and House
approve the Defense Bill, it is sent to the President for signature into law. Theoretically,
Congress will send the Defense Bill to the President prior to October 1 of the new fiscal year that
the Defense budget is funding. If that does not happen by 1 Oct, Congress will either enact a
Continuing Resolution to keep the Government and DoD operating or the Government and DoD
will shut down until funding is approved.
6.3. Continuing Resolution. If a Continuing Resolution is enacted, NGB/FM is responsible for
executing the ANG budget within the constraints imposed in the Continuing Resolution.
