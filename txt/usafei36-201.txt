This instruction implements AFPD 36-2, Employment and Affirmative Action. It establishes the policies
and procedures for the operation of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Appropriated Fund
Summer and School Year Student Employment Programs. It is based on authority contained in Assistant
Secretary of Defense (ASD) (Manpower, Reserve Affairs) Memorandum, 14 July 1972, and ASD (Man-
power and Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) Memorandum, 12 May 1981, Summer and Student Employ-
ment of US Citizen Dependent Youth in Foreign Areas, and Air Force Supplement to Federal Personnel
Manual, Chapter 213, Excepted Service. See Attachment 1 for a list references, acronyms, and terms.
See Attachment 2 for student employee pay and leave entitlements.
Summary of Revisions
This instruction is revised to update terminology and organization changes; add coordination with local
customer service representative (paragraph 1.3.6); add installation responsibility to fund program (para-
graph 3.3) and deletes sample financial request, sample standard position descriptions, title and series
information. A margin bar indicates changes from the previous version.



1. Policy, Objective, and Planning.
   1.1. Policy. Consistent with the availability of resources, USAFE appropriated fund activities will
   operate the student employment programs as prescribed in this instruction. Activities of other com-
   mands which are serviced by a USAFE civilian personnel flight (CPF) are encouraged to participate
   in these programs by identifying and funding their student positions.
   1.2. Objective. The objective of the USAFE student employment programs is to accomplish neces-
   sary work through the temporary employment of US citizen student dependents. As a by-product of
   this objective, students are given the opportunity to gain work experience and to earn money while in
   the overseas area. For information concerning education-related work assignments for students in a
   nonpay status, refer to Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 308, Volunteer Service.

    1.3. Advance Planning. Careful advance planning is important to assure the success of the student
    employment programs. Therefore, civilian personnel officers will ensure that all necessary prepara-
    tory actions, including the following, are initiated in a timely manner and subsequently monitored to
    completion:
       1.3.1. Provide appropriate information to commanders and supervisors to solicit their support.
       1.3.2. Request serviced organizations identify the number of positions to be used for student
       employment and provide the names of supervisors to be contacted.
       1.3.3. Publicize the program to ensure all interested, eligible students are afforded an equal oppor-
       tunity to apply. Publicity should include information regarding eligibility criteria, types of posi-
       tions available, duration of employment, work schedules (full or part-time), weekly and daily duty
       hours, rate of pay, procedures to follow in applying for work, necessity for possessing a Social
       Security Account Number (SSAN), and other information deemed appropriate or necessary.
       1.3.4. Develop employment plans that will assure maximum employment opportunities for all eli-
       gible applicants.
       1.3.5. Train supervisors and orient employees.
       1.3.6. Ensure early coordination with local customer service representative to determine appro-
       priate organization information is in the Defense Civilian Payroll System.

        history repository check (SCHRC) is not required. Students so hired must be placed under

        that they are assigned.

Terms
Dependents—The spouse or unmarried child of an active duty military member or a federal US citizen
civilian employee recruited in the United States. Family members of locally hired civilian employees are
not considered dependents for employment purposes in accordance with DoD Instruction 1400.23.
School Year Employment—Temporary part-time employment while attending school on a substantially
full-time basis. For pay and leave purposes, students hired for the school year employment program are
equivalent to general schedule employees.
Student—A US citizen who is at least 14, but less than 23 years old; enrolled or has been accepted for
enrollment (during upcoming semester or quarter) on a substantially full-time basis as a resident (actual
physical attendance) student of a secondary school or an institution of higher learning. For individuals
graduating from a secondary school who have not yet been accepted into an institution of higher learning,
a statement from the sponsor or parent and verified by the secondary school principal or counselor that
application has been made is adequate evidence to qualify as a student. NOTE: NON-US citizen student
dependents may not be employed in the USAFE student employment programs according to Air Force
Sup to FPM Chapter 213-I, paragraph 5a(6)(b). Non-US citizen dependents may only be employed under
the laws, rules, and regulations of the host country. All host countries where USAFE CPF serviced
organizations are located exclude the employment of some non-US citizens and (or) prohibit paying
non-US citizens in US dollars. These exclusions, found in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Status
of Forces Agreement (SOFA), agreements with host countries, and host country laws, thus prohibit the
employment of non-US citizen dependents in the USAFE student employment programs.
Student Work—Necessary work defined in paragraph 2.2 which normally must be accomplished by
temporary overhire or for which no other labor resources are available.
Summer Employment—Temporary full-time or part-time employment during the normal school year
summer vacation. For pay and leave purposes, students hired for the summer employment program are
equivalent to wage grade employees.
