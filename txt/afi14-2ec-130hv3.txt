1.1. General.
     1.1.1. Scope. This volume outlines the procedures applicable to EC-130H intelligence
     operations. With the complementary references cited, this volume prescribes standard
     operational procedures to be used by all EC-130H ground intelligence personnel. These
     operational procedures are the minimum and can be supplemented by additional unit-level
     written guidance. Unit-level written guidance may expand upon these basic procedures, but
     in no case will it be less restrictive.
     1.1.2. References. The primary references for EC-130H intelligence operations are AFI 14-
     2EC-130H Volume 1, EC-130H Unit Intelligence Training; AFI 14-2EC-130H Volume 2,
     EC-130H Unit Intelligence Evaluation Criteria; AFTTP 3-1.General Planning, General
     Planning and Employment Considerations; AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide, Threat Reference
     Guide and Countertactics; AFTTP 3-1.EC-130H, Tactical Employment—EC-130H; and this
     publication.
     1.1.3. Compliance. The senior intelligence officer (SIO) will ensure compliance with Air
     Force and MAJCOM directives and procedures as well as special notices in the Intelligence
     Read File (IRF).
     1.1.4. Waivers.    ACC/A2 will notify AF/A2DF of significant trends in waiver
     correspondence if such correspondence indicates the need to readdress existing policy and
     guidance.

                          EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of EIT: Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force
Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). The Chief of Wing Intelligence may determine if other
unit personnel require external training and will modify training requirements as appropriate.
3.2. External Intelligence Training Program Management.
     3.2.1. Only qualified external intelligence trainers will conduct unsupervised EIT events.
     (T-2) EIT specialized training requirements and evaluation criteria are identified in AFI 14-
     2C-130, Volumes 1 and 2.
     3.2.2. The Chief of Wing Intelligence will:
        3.2.2.1. Appoint in writing an EIT program manager to oversee program execution. (T-
        3)
        3.2.2.2. Coordinate detailed program guidance with all applicable commanders of any
        unit for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly scheduled basis. (T-3)
     3.2.3. The EIT Program Manager will:
        3.2.3.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems,
        projected wartime/Air Expeditionary Force tasking, deployment and forward operating
        location(s). Include input from operational squadrons, tactics representative, aircrew
        flight equipment (AFE) personnel, SF personnel, AFOSI, and Survival, Evasion,
        Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, as appropriate. (T-2)
        3.2.3.2. Develop written guidance on procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
        evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. (T-3)
            3.2.3.2.1. List specific training objectives for each major area of intelligence training
            and the training method and resources used to satisfy the objective. Training methods
            may include, but are not limited to: briefings, demonstration-performance, formal
            and informal lectures. Training resources may include, but are not limited to: threat-
            of-the day briefings, current intelligence briefings, academic training sessions, theater
            orientation briefings and weapons system videos.
            3.2.3.2.2. Coordinate this guidance with any agency (e.g. Tactics, SERE, AFE) that
            assists intelligence personnel in providing training.
        3.2.3.3. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training
        cycle. (T-3)
        3.2.3.4. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
        requirements. (T-3)
        3.2.3.5. Analyze trends following each training cycle and apply lessons learned, as
        applicable. (T-3)
        3.2.3.6. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group EIT program to the appropriate
        commander at the end of each training cycle. The evaluation will include as a minimum:
AFI14-2EC-130HV3 28 November 2012                                                                9


       the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (high miss questions, weak
       areas, etc.); and corrective actions taken. See Attachment 5 for an EIT Report example.
       (T-3)
3.3. Aircrew Intelligence Training. AIT will be coordinated with the wing or group Tactics
Flight or Officer. The AIT program will cover, at a minimum, these topics on an annual basis:
   3.3.1. Threat Knowledge.
       3.3.1.1. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for direct unit
       involvement. Include examples of weapons employment tactics (e.g., enemy use of
       barrage fire, 4-ship flight formations, etc.).
       3.3.1.2. Provide inputs to the lead MAJCOM-developed master question file (MQF).
       3.3.1.3. Ensure AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide is the primary reference for threat knowledge
       training and ensure training is current with the latest edition. Ensure AFTTP 3-1.EC-
       130H is the primary reference for EC-130H tactics and ensure training is current with the
       latest edition. References may be supplemented with other classified and unclassified
       publications such as Tactics Bulletins, Tactics Analysis Reports, Country Studies, etc.
   3.3.2. Visual Recognition (VR). Only aircrew members with a visual vantage point outside
   the aircraft require VR training. It is recommended for all other aircrew.
       3.3.2.1. Ensure VR training includes airframes likely to be encountered in the unit-tasked
       Area of Responsibility including rotary and fixed-wing, as well as joint/allied assets.
       Training also should cover major categories of ground equipment and naval vessels.
       3.3.2.2. Training should incorporate all aspects/angles, theater specific paint schemes, fin
       flashes and various configurations. Training should teach aircrew how to describe threats
       they encounter to assist intelligence personnel in positive identification. Include

 actors/forces. In addition to providing the current situation, the analyst
 should also identify potential actions or decisions that could significantly
 change the situation (i.e. use analytical skills).Follow local directives
 regarding the briefing’s timing, contents, and name.
