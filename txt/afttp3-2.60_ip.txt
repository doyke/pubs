                                       PREFACE 


1.   Scope
      This publication is designed for use at the tactical and operational levels. This
manual provides multiservice tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) for chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) decontamination. It defines the roles of
military units and staffs involved in the preparation, planning, and execution of
decontamination operations. It addresses the requirements for the different techniques
used in decontamination. This manual focuses on the need for all United States (US) forces
to be prepared to fight and win in a CBRN environment. It addresses the support the
Department of Defense (DOD) may have to provide to support homeland security (HLS).
The planning and coordination for CBRN decontamination takes place with the realization
that the potential CBRN environment could be one in which there is deliberate or
accidental employment of CBRN weapons, or deliberate or accidental attacks or
contamination with toxic industrial material (TIM) (see Joint Doctrine for Operations in
Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical [NBC] Environments).
2.   Purpose
       This publication provides a reference for CBRN decontamination; bridges the gap
between service and joint doctrine; and contains tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)
for planning and executing operations in a CBRN environment. This manual addresses
concepts, principles, and TTP to include planning, operational considerations, and training
and support functions. It serves as the foundation for the development of multiservice
manuals and refinement of existing training support packages (TSPs), mission training
plans (MTPs), training center and unit exercises, and service school curricula. It drives the
examination of organizations and materiel developments applicable to CBRN
decontamination.
3.   Application
      The audience for this publication is combatant commands, joint task forces (JTFs),
functional and service component units, and staffs in foreign and domestic locations that
could be challenged by operations in a CBRN environment.
4.   Implementation Plan

     DECONTAMINATION: CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES, AND LEVELS 




1.   Background
     The hazards associated with CBRN attacks and events often force US forces into
protective equipment, thereby degrading their ability to perform individual and collective
tasks and reducing combat power. Such hazards may be created by the deliberate use of
CBRN weapons or a release from industrial sources. Additionally, they may be created by
accidental release, natural disasters, or collateral damage release from industrial sources
(TIM). These hazards may require decontamination of personnel, equipment, facilities, or
terrain.
     a.   Forms of Contamination. CBRN agent contamination is the deposition on or
absorption of CBRN agents by personnel, materiel, structures, and terrain. US forces may
encounter CBRN agent contamination through direct attack, movement through
contaminated areas, the unwitting use of contaminated facilities, or the movement of agent
clouds. Forms of contamination may be—
          (1) Vapor. Vapors can be generated by generators or bursting munitions.
Vapor in an open or outdoor area will generally disperse rapidly.
          (2) Liquid. CB agents can be disseminated as liquids. Liquid droplets can
range from thick and sticky to the consistency of water. Liquids can also be disseminated
as an aerosol.
         (3) Aerosol. An aerosol is a liquid or solid composed of finely divided particles
suspended in a gaseous medium. Examples of common aerosols are mist, fog, and smoke.
They behave much like vapors.
            (4) Solids. Solid forms of contamination include radioactive particles,
biological spores, and dusty agents. A dusty agent is a solid agent that can be disseminated
as an aerosol.
    b.    Hazard Transmission. When CBRN contamination cannot be avoided, resources
may require decontamination. Contaminated hazards can be transmitted as follows:
         (1) Transfer. Anything that contacts a surface covered with liquids or solids
contamination will tend to pick up that contamination and move it from one surface to
another.
          (2) Spread. Touching a surface covered with liquid or solid contamination can
spread contamination on that same surface.
           (3) Desorption. Liquid contamination absorbs into porous material. Once
absorbed, it begins to desorb or give off low levels of vapor that pass into the air.
           (4) Vapor and Aerosol. Vapors and aerosols can be carried through the air and
will disperse rapidly.

     c.    Decontamination. CBRN agent contamination should be avoided when possible.
When this is not possible, personnel and equipment must be decontaminated to reduce or
eliminate the risk to personnel and to make equipment serviceable. Decontamination
procedures will not degrade the performance of personnel or equipment and will not harm
the environment. The levels of decontamination are immediate, operational, thorough, and
clearance.
           (1) Immediate Decontamination. Immediate decontamination minimizes
casualties and limits the spread or transfer of contamination.
          (2) Operational Decontamination. Operational decontamination sustains
operations by reducing the contact hazard, limiting the spread of contamination, and
eliminating or reducing the duration that MOPP equipment must be used.
            (3) Thorough Decontamination. Thorough decontamination reduces
contamination to the lowest detectable level by the use of tactical-level capabilities. The
intent of thorough decontamination is to reduce or eliminate the level of MOPP. This is
accomplished by units (with or without external support) when operations and resources
permit.
         (4) Clearance Decontamination. Clearance decontamination provides
decontamination to a level that allows unrestricted transportation, maintenance,
employment, and disposal.
    d.    Methods of Decontamination. Decontamination is accomplished by
neutralization, physical removal, and weathering.
           (1) Neutralization. Neutralization is the most widely used method of
decontamination, particularly for chemical warfare (CW) agents. Neutralization is the
reaction of the contaminating agent with other chemicals to render the agent less toxic or
nontoxic. When mixed with a reactive decontaminant, the agent is converted into other
substances (i.e., reaction products). The reactive decontaminant may be a commonly
available material (e.g., household bleach) or a specifically designed decontaminating agent
(see Appendix A for measurements and weights of containers that could be used).
           (2) Physical Removal. Physical removal is the relocation of the contamination
from one mission-critical surface to another less important location. Physical removal
generally leaves the contamination in toxic form. It often involves the subsequent
neutralization of the contamination. For example, if soap and water are used to remove the
agent, the runoff may be drained into a pit containing bleaching powder. However,
depending on mission requirements, physical removal can be an effective technique without
subsequent neutralization.
           (3) Weathering. Weathering involves such processes as evaporation and
irradiation to remove or destroy the contaminant. The contaminated item is exposed to
natural elements (e.g., sun, wind, heat, precipitation) to dilute or destroy the contaminant
to the point of reduced or negligible hazard. This may be as simple as letting a vehicle sit
in the hot desert sun to bake off the contaminant. Natural weathering is the simplest and
most often preferred method of decontamination, particularly for terrain and
non-mission-essential buildings and roads.

2.   Hazard
     The potential for the increased use of CBRN weapons and the increased risk of TIM
hazards from commercial, industrial and medical facilities has increased the urgency for
developing more effective detection, protection, and decontamination procedures and
equipment (see Appendix B for more information on the technical aspects of CBRN
decontamination). Opposing forces may acquire or produce CBRN agents or seize TIM from
commercial facilities. During the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, Muslim forces
deliberately positioned canisters of chlorine from the Tuzla industrial chemical plant to
deter Serb artillery attacks.
     a.    CW Agents and Delivery Means. Typically classified by their effects on the body,
CW agents consist of choking, nerve, blood, blister, and incapacitating agents (see Potential
Military Chemical/Biological Agents and Compounds for more information on CW agents).
Virtually all weapons systems, from howitzers to aerial bombs and missiles, can be used to
deliver CW agents over a wide area. Terrorists and insurgents can use spray systems or
other devices in localized attacks.
     b.     Biological Warfare (BW) Agents and Delivery Means. BW is the use of
pathogens or toxins as weapons. BW agents include anthrax, plague, cholera, smallpox,
ricin toxin, botulinum toxin, mycotoxin, aflatoxin, and many others. Conventional
munitions, such as aerial bombs and missile warheads, can be modified to deliver BW
agents. Other delivery means include spray devices affixed to manned aircraft or aerial
drones and ground-based aerosol generators.
    c.    Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs). RDDs scatter radiological material
without a nuclear explosion. The material is dispersed by a small blast to contaminate and
deny access to terrain or facilities, which slows military operations. “Dirty bomb” is a
common term for an RDD.
    d.   Nuclear Weapons. Nuclear weapons can be delivered by conventional or
unconventional means. Weapons effects can cause significant residual radiation hazards.
      e.    TIM. Industry develops and produces TIM for industrial operations or for
research by industry, government, and academia. These TIM are not manufactured to
produce human casualties or to contaminate equipment and facilities. Nevertheless, TIM
can be highly dangerous and lethal. Rapid industrialization in the developing world is
seldom accompanied by the safety and regulatory regimes found in the United States and
Western Europe. Hazards from TIM can occur through collateral damage to industrial
facilities or through the acquisition and use of these chemicals by opposing forces. These
TIM include hydrogen cyanide, cyanogens chloride, phosgene, and chloropicrin. Many
herbicides and pesticides are TIM that could also present a contamination hazard.
3.   Concepts—Combat Operations
     Decontamination is necessary to allow personnel to remove their protective gear and
resume normal operations after they become contaminated. Weathering is the most
desirable means of decontamination. However, time and operational needs may not permit
this option.
    a.    Decontamination Purpose and Operational Impact. Decontamination is the
removal or neutralization of hazardous levels of contamination from personnel, equipment,




4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                I-3
materiel, and terrain. The ultimate purpose of decontamination is to restore full combat
power in the shortest possible time.
    b.    Principles of Decontamination Operations. Decontaminate immediately for an
agent on the skin. Perform higher levels of decontamination as a result of risk assessment.
Personnel should consider the following:
           (1) Speed. Personnel should conduct decontamination operations as quickly as
possible. Direct exposure to some CBRN, toxic industrial chemicals (TIC), or TIM agents
will create casualties and could be fatal within minutes. The sooner equipment is
decontaminated, the less likely it is to absorb the agent or spread to other surfaces.
          (2) Need. Decontaminate only what is necessary. Personnel have a limited
amount of resources available and should expend resources only where they are needed.
           (3) Priority. Decontaminate the most essential items first; foremost will be the
skin if contact occurs. Once wearing protective equipment, personnel should begin
decontamination operations on clothing, equipment, and vehicles.
          (4) Limited Area. Personnel should perform decontamination near the area
where the contamination occurs. This limits the spread of contamination to other areas
and reduces the time spent traveling.
      c.    Response—Wartime Operations. When a CBRN incident occurs, the commander
must decide whether decontamination is required to restore combat power and, if so, what
level of decontamination is required (see Table I-1 and Table I-2). Immediate and
operational decontamination are time-critical. These levels of decontamination save lives
and help to regenerate and maintain combat power. The units and activities affected will
continue their primary mission. However, the level of effort required for thorough and
clearance decontamination will remove the unit (for an extended period of time) from the
primary mission. Decontamination is not a sequential process that requires the conduct (in
order) of immediate, operational, and thorough decontamination. For example, weathering
may alleviate the requirement to conduct thorough decontamination. See Appendix C for
further information on the decontaminants that can be used for the different levels of
decontamination.
           (1) Immediate. Immediate decontamination is carried out to save lives and
reduce penetration of agent into surfaces. This may include decontamination of personnel,
clothing, and equipment. Immediate decontamination will help prevent casualties and
permit the use of individual equipment and key systems.
                 (a) Skin decontamination is a basic survival skill and should be
performed within 1 minute of being contaminated. Decontamination of the eyes is an
immediate decontamination action that involves flushing the eyes with water as soon as
possible following contamination (see Chapter III).
                (b) Personal wipe down should be performed within 15 minutes. This is
done to remove contamination from individual equipment. Use detector paper or an
improved chemical-agent monitor (ICAM) to locate the agent. Use a radiac set to locate
radiological contamination; and then brush, wipe, or shake it off.

                (c) Operator wipe down should be done within 15 minutes. Operators use
the M100 Sorbent Decontamination System (SDS) to decontaminate the surfaces they need
to touch or contact to operate the equipment. Radiological contamination in the form of
dust particles may be wiped, scraped, or brushed off.
NOTE: The M100 SDS is not authorized for use on Naval aircraft.

           (2) Operational. Operational decontamination is carried out by contaminated
units (with possible assistance from a decontamination unit). It is restricted to the specific
parts of contaminated, operationally essential equipment, material and work areas to
minimize contact and transfer hazards and to sustain operations. This may include
individual decontamination beyond the scope of immediate decontamination,
decontamination of mission-essential equipment, and limited terrain decontamination.
Operational decontamination reduces the level of contamination, thus lessening the chance
of spread and transfer. When combined with weathering, MOPP levels may be reduced
without further decontamination, depending on the surface or material being
decontaminated and the agent. See Appendix D for more information on the
decontamination of specific surfaces.
               (a) A MOPP gear exchange should be performed within 6 hours of being
contaminated due to the performance degradation that occurs when a unit is in MOPP4. A
MOPP gear exchange allows a unit to remove the gross contamination from personnel and
equipment, which provides temporary relief from MOPP4 and a return to an increased
operating tempo (OPTEMPO) in pursuit of mission accomplishment.
                (b)   Vehicle wash down should be performed—
                     • Within 1 hour of contamination for equipment that is not painted
with chemical agent-resistant coating (CARC).
                      •   Within 6 hours of contamination for CARC-painted equipment
                      •   When the mission does not permit a thorough decontamination.
           (3) Thorough. DED and DAD are conducted as part of a reconstitution effort
during breaks in combat operations. These operations require immense logistical support
and are manpower-intensive. Thorough decontamination is carried out to reduce
contamination on personnel, equipment, materiel, and work areas. This permits the partial
or total removal of individual protective equipment (IPE) and maintains operations with
minimum degradation. While conducting thorough decontamination, contaminated units
will be non-mission-capable. The resulting decrease in MOPP will allow the unit to operate
with restored effectiveness.
                 (a) The DED and DAD restore items so that they can be used without
protective equipment. As a safety measure, some services require the use of protective
gloves until clearance decontamination has been completed. These operations require
support from a CBRN decontamination unit or element.
                 (b) Representative actions that may follow a thorough decontamination
include the following:
              •    Replacing personnel who may have become injured or ill during
decontamination operations.
              •     Reordering supplies (e.g., detector paper, decontamination solution,
decontamination kits and apparatuses).
                 •    Maintaining or repairing vehicles and equipment, including
recalibration or replacement of detectors and alarms.

                •    Marking used decontamination sites and selecting new
decontamination sites, reporting old and new decontamination sites, and recording and
reporting previously contaminated personnel and equipment.
                •    Documenting resource expenditures.
                •    Conducting force health protection (FHP).
                •    Preparing after-action reviews.
           (4) Clearance. Clearance decontamination of equipment and personnel allows
the operation to continue unrestricted. Decontamination at this level will probably be
conducted at or near a shipyard, advanced base, or other industrial facility. Clearance
decontamination involves factors such as suspending normal activities, withdrawing
personnel, and having materials and facilities not normally present. Essentially, resources
from an industrial base (e.g., Army Materiel Command, Air Force Material Command,
Naval Sea Systems Command, and Marine Corps Systems Command [MARCORSYSCOM])
will be required. During clearance decontamination, resource expenditures are
documented, FHP measures are conducted, and after-action reviews are prepared.
     d.    Decontamination Decisions.
           (1) The decision to decontaminate is a risk assessment and is made within the
context of mission, enemy, terrain and weather, time, troops available and civilian
(METT-TC) considerations, and the resources available (see Figure I-1, page I-8).
NOTE: The USMC uses the term mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and
support available—time available (METT-T) vice the Army’s use of METT-TC.
Civilian considerations are inherently measured within the context of this
acronym.




               Figure I-1. How Decontamination Affects Combat Effectiveness




4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              I-7
                 (a) The individual or crew decision to conduct immediate decontamination
will minimize casualties and limit the contact hazard. This applies the speed and need
principles of decontamination. Following decontamination, the unit continues to “fight
dirty.” The unit’s MOPP provides protection; however, continued wearing of MOPP gear
causes performance degradation.
                (b) The unit or activity decision to conduct operational decontamination
will provide temporary relief from MOPP4 and limit the spread of contamination.
Operational decontamination supports sustained unit operations for prolonged periods and
is conducted as far forward as possible.
                 (c) The command decision to conduct thorough decontamination should
reduce contamination below the detectable level with tactical-level detection equipment.
Caution should be exercised. Current tactical detectors are not sensitive enough to ensure
that the item does not off-gas when the temperature rises. Units can operate at this
temperature without the degradation imposed by higher MOPP levels. The commander
determines which assets are critical for a subsequent mission and allocates the resources to
conduct DED and DTD. The commander accepts the trade-off that the contaminated assets
will not be available for the period of time required to conduct a thorough decontamination.
           (2) The commander applies METT-TC considerations to the risk assessment
process to determine if and where operational or thorough decontamination is required.
For example, weathering may reduce contamination below detectable levels. Additionally,
thorough decontamination may be deferred until the operational situation or resources are
available to support the process. Furthermore, unique requirements such as
decontamination of electronic equipment or depleted uranium (DU) contamination may
have special considerations (see Appendix E for more information).
           (3) Risk assessment is a continuous process. Low-level residual contamination
may remain following weathering or decontamination. The contamination may also not be
detectable by tactical-level detection devices (see Appendix F for a summary of how the
environment could impact decontamination operations). Medical surveillance (MEDSURV),
conducted by preventive medicine (PVNTMED) personnel, is an FHP measure to identify
medical threats for personnel who may be exposed.
4.    Concepts—Homeland Security
      HLS missions may require that defense decontamination support be furnished for the
two component parts of HLS—homeland defense (HLD) and CS. Decontamination support
will follow a process that essentially involves preparation, response, recovery, and
restoration. (Chapter XI provides more detailed information on decontamination support
for HLS.) CBRN decontamination operations conducted in support of HLS will comply with
29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and
Emergency Response, within the United States, its territories, and possessions.
      a.   Preparation Phase. Military units tasked to assist local or state responders must
become intimately familiar with the National Response Plan (NRP) and coordinate and
train closely with local civilian emergency response agencies so that protocols and
procedures are coordinated, understood, and practiced before an actual event occurs in the
community. Whether preparing for HLS or combat operations, US military forces maintain
the capability to conduct or support decontamination based on unit capabilities. Unit or

activity HLS preparatory actions are similar to other contingencies. Representative actions
include—
         •   Planning contingency operations.
         •   Preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs).
         •   Conducting liaison with applicable organizations.
         •   Establishing memorandums of agreement (MOAs) with appropriate authorities.
         •   Establishing and maintaining required certifications.
         •   Conducting training and exercises.
    •     Obtaining required equipment (commercial or government) to accomplish
primary or collateral missions (e.g., patient decontamination).
     b.    Response Phase. When a threat or an actual occurrence of a CBRN incident
requires HLD or CS decontamination support, DOD resources with decontamination
capabilities may respond. The required missions may include mass and casualty
decontamination, or technical assistance for decontamination (see Chapter XI for more
information on these missions). Personnel performing decontamination operations in
support of HLS must be trained and certified to the first-responder operations level as
defined in 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.
    c.      Recovery Phase. For CS, recovery, transition, and redeployment operations start
when civil authorities or other designated agencies relieve the commander of selected
decontamination-related tasks. The operational duration of the response mission is
determined by the requirements established by the appropriate authority. The
requirement for mass and casualty decontamination will likely end following the response
phase. The requirement for technical decontamination to support first-responder
operations in a hot zone may continue. Military units with decontamination capabilities
may redeploy during this phase or be assigned other responsibilities. A transition plan is
implemented and tasks are transferred from the commander to the appropriate civil
authorities. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and contracted services may augment
these civil authorities. Upon completion of the required recovery support, the commander
executes a transition and redeploys.
    d.     Restoration Phase. Restoration constitutes those actions necessary to return the
decontamination section or unit to its full operational capability. Restoration actions will
generally be done at a unit’s home station. Restoration actions may include the following:
         (1) Replacing personnel who may have become injured/ill during
decontamination operations.
         (2) Reordering supplies (e.g., detector paper, decontamination solution,
decontamination kits and apparatuses).
          (3) Maintaining and repairing vehicles and equipment, including recalibration
or replacement of detectors and alarms.
             (4)   Marking used decontamination sites and selecting new decontamination
sites.
      (5)          Documenting personnel and equipment expenditures, event logs, and
MEDSURV.

          (6) Concluding outstanding agreements with civil authorities or CS
organizations.
5.     Service Capabilities
     All services have varying levels of CBRN decontamination capabilities. All US forces
at the individual warfighter level must have immediate decontamination capabilities. Most
US military units at the major subordinate command level (e.g., brigade, regiment, wing,
shipboard) have operational and thorough decontamination capabilities. Clearance
decontamination will normally be conducted at the Unified Combatant Command level (i.e.,
Central Command [CENTCOM]) with the assistance of multiple agencies within the
command.
6.     Training and Exercises
     Individual and joint unit decontamination training across the force ensures the
readiness to fight and win should an adversary employ CBRN weapons. Training is a
responsibility shared by combatant commands, services, and a number of DOD agencies.
Training and exercise programs must incorporate the principles for operations in CBRN
environments and include realistic consideration of CBRN weapons effects on sustained
combat operations.
     a.    Training. Training opportunities exist both internally and externally and should
include the following:
       •    Initial and sustainment training.
       •    Individual, collective, and unit training.
       •    Intra-agency and interagency training.
     b.    Exercises. Exercises provide the opportunity to interact with other units or
services and federal, state, or local agencies. Exercises developed by non-DOD agencies
provide an opportunity to improve military capabilities for support of HLS operations with
minimal resources. These exercises emphasize interoperability requirements and stress
staff coordination. They also serve to identify shortfalls in communications or other
capabilities that must be corrected.

                                         Chapter II
      DECONTAMINATION OPERATIONS: PLAN, PREPARE, AND 

                        EXECUTE 


1.   Background
     Decontamination planning provides recommendations for commanders’ guidance.
This helps ensure that forces and facilities are prepared to operate in CBRN environments;
supports the commander’s decision-making requirements; and identifies, assesses, and
estimates the enemy’s CBRN capabilities, intentions, and most likely courses of action
(COAs).
2.   Decontamination Planning
     The decontamination planner must consider the hazards that may result from CBRN
or TIM contamination. Decontamination assessments include mission analysis, COA
development, and the analysis and comparison of enemy and friendly COAs.
Decontamination planning is dynamic and continuous from preattack to postattack,
through recovery operations.
NOTE: TIC and other hazardous materials [HAZMAT] are considered TIM
throughout this manual.
        The unit CBRN defense personnel and staff work together to ensure that
decontamination planning is fully integrated into deliberate and crisis action planning.
They accomplish this through wargaming friendly versus enemy COAs and by mutually
developing products designed to assist the service components, multinational partners, and
joint force commanders (JFCs) decision-making processes.
     a.    Commanders, with input from their staffs, assess their vulnerability to CBRN
attacks. Commanders determine the required protection for their units by assessing the
capabilities of the enemy. They estimate the likely impact of CBRN attacks and, based on
the concept of operations (CONOPS), determine the methods to reduce the impact and
allow for mission accomplishment. This includes MOPP acclimatization training and
decontamination planning to mitigate the affects of a CBRN attack. See Multiservice
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Vulnerability
Assessment for further information on CBRN vulnerability assessment (VA).
    b.     The CBRN planner writes a decontamination plan as part of a CBRN defense
annex of the operation order (OPORD).
          (1) In preparing the decontamination portion of the CBRN defense annex, the
planner assesses the likelihood that decontamination operations will be required, the
probable extent of those operations, and the best procedures for execution.
          (2) In preparing the decontamination portion of the CBRN defense annex, the
planner should consider the following questions:
          • Does the enemy possess CBRN weapons and has he demonstrated the intent
to use them?
           •   Does the unit’s mission bring it into likely contact with TIM hazards?


4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             II-1
        • What is the unit’s decontamination capability (see Appendixes G and H for a
summary of decontamination capabilities for the services)?
         • Does weather and terrain favor enemy use of CBRN weapons? (For terrain
decontamination, see Appendix I.)
          •   What are the unit’s logistics requirements?
          •   What is the unit’s level of decontamination training?
          •   Is contamination avoidance possible?
          •   What decontamination assets are available?
          • What likely decontamination sites are available (through map
reconnaissance)?
            (3) During the plan preparation, all factors of the METT-TC considerations are
measured. The METT-TC considerations will impact the representative planning areas
(e.g., decontamination sites, priorities of effort, decontamination decisions, and
decontamination triage).
                 (a) The preselection of decontamination sites is essentially a map
reconnaissance that is based on the supported commander’s plan. (Detailed information on
a potential site may be determined from intelligence assets.) Preselected sites should be
within an avenue of approach, but just off main routes for easy access. Close proximity to
rivers, streams, or other water sources is also important. In conducting a map
reconnaissance, consider the following:
               •     Probable level of decontamination that will be conducted.
               •     Terrain (soil composition).
               •     Mission.
               •     Cover and concealment.
               •     Water sources.
               •     Drainage.
               •     Presence or absence of contamination.
               •    Road network that facilitates the movement in and out of the site for
both the contaminated unit and the resupply squad.
              •      Adequate area for the dispersal of equipment before, during, and after
decontamination.
               •     Location of downwind friendly personnel.
                  (b) The commander will establish priorities of effort that determine which
contaminated units are decontaminated first. Since decontamination assets are limited,
the commander must establish a priority of decontamination support. The priority of effort
lists the units in the order they will receive decontamination support. This can change
from phase to phase during an operation. The CBRN staff develops the priority of effort
based on an understanding of the commander’s intent.




II-2                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
              (c) The commander decides when and where operational and thorough
decontamination will occur according to METT-TC. Note that the different levels of
immediate decontamination always occur as battle drills at the prescribed times following a
CBRN attack.
                 (d) Planning to decontaminate what is necessary ensures that units or
activities understand the decontamination triage (identifying clean and dirty elements).
Even though a unit has been identified for decontamination, it does not follow that each
individual, vehicle, or item belonging to that unit is contaminated. Decontamination triage
is the process of identifying those individuals, vehicles, aircraft, ships, ships spaces, or
items of equipment that require decontamination. Only the identified elements are to be
processed through the decontamination site. The commander may then employ his
uncontaminated elements to support the decontamination operation.
      c.   Plans for decontamination operations will be included in the CBRN defense
annex to the operation plan (OPLAN) or OPORD. In preparing the decontamination
portion of the CBRN defense annexes, the planner must assess the disposition of forces and
assets available for CBRN reconnaissance and decontamination. It must identify locations
for preselected decontamination sites and linkup points and the missions for the CBRN
decontamination assets. It must also identify plans for divert airfields and/or naval vessels
for recovery operations and identify contingency plans for stations, ports, airfields, forward
arming and refueling points (FARPs), and facilities to receive contaminated aircraft and
ships with personnel and cargo aboard.
3.   Wartime Planning Considerations
     Multiple factors must be considered when planning CBRN decontamination during
wartime.
     a.    Joint or Combined Operations. These factors include the following:
     •     Intelligence collection, analysis, and production.
     •     Situational awareness (SA).
     •     Common planning, training, and equipment standards.
     •     Health service support (HSS).
     •     Protection of the joint rear area (JRA) and theater sustainment capabilities.
     •     Priorities.
     •     Minimum essential requirements for the decontamination.
     •     Human factor effects of the MOPP.
     •     Logistics burden of CBRN decontamination.
     •     Effect of the CBRN attack on the C2 systems.
     •   Capabilities and limitations of US, multinational, and host nation (HN)
decontamination assets.
    •  Consequence management (CM) support outside the continental United States
(OCONUS), its territories, and possessions.
     •     Mortuary affairs.



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                II-3
           (1) SA. Adequate SA is a central concern for decontamination planning. An
integrated warning and reporting system provides a significant measure of protection by
allowing friendly forces to minimize exposure to the hazard. Accurate and timely
understanding of the hazard and its effect minimizes the possibility of having excessive or
inadequate force protection (FP). Warning system provisions also address the need to warn
personnel, based on an alarm, thus causing units to increase their protective posture, and
can act as a warning order (WARNORD) for dedicated decontamination assets.
          (2) Common Planning, Training, and Equipment Standards. Common
standards for CBRN decontamination (especially training, exercises, and equipment
maintenance) enhance joint force capabilities.
            (3) HSS. Key elements of HSS include casualty estimation, chemoprophylaxis
and immunizations, MEDSURV, PVNTMED, diagnostics, mass casualty management,
evacuation, and patient decontamination requirements. HSS planning addresses
decontamination considerations. Unit plans should recognize that CBRN attacks have the
potential to create mass casualties. The treatment and evacuation of CBRN patients will
be difficult and hazardous to the patients, medical personnel, and medical treatment
facilities (MTFs). HSS CBRN defense planning includes appropriate liaison with affected
and supportive civilian HSS MTFs and an assessment of the capabilities and limitations of
those MTFs.
            (4) Protection of the JRA and Theater Sustainment Capabilities. The JRA and
theater sustainment capabilities must be protected. A successful adversary CBRN attack
on a critical logistics facility or a major TIM attack near it may degrade OPTEMPO and
force generation capabilities. Mitigation and decontamination measures focus on
maintaining support to combat operations and rapidly restoring the degraded capabilities.
Alternate sites are designated and exercised in advance to ensure uninterrupted JRA
operations and theater sustainment capabilities.
           (5) Priorities. In wartime, manpower and time are critical resources that
cannot be wasted on nonessential tasks. Therefore, the decontamination of areas, facilities,
and equipment will be prioritized and limited by necessity, to allow resumption of
operations by protected personnel. Priorities will be directly impacted by the mission with
the realization that protected personnel can work with contaminated equipment.
Therefore, decontamination must be aimed at restoring mission capability rather than
totally minimizing hazards. If decontamination is not possible or needed,
non-mission-essential areas may be marked and restricted from use. The first priority will
be given to personal decontamination to prevent casualties and reduce manpower losses.
The second priority will be the decontamination of equipment and material or facilities
necessary to meet mission requirements as established by the commander. During
wartime, decontamination operations will be expedited as the situation requires. Primary
considerations will be for effective accomplishment of the mission.
          (6) Minimum Essential Requirements. The minimal conditions that should be
met in planning decontamination operations are as follows:
          •     Identification of contamination.
          •     Designation and marking of contaminated area.
         •    Identification of facilities, equipment, and material that have been
contaminated.

             •      Availability of personnel to fully operate each decontamination station.
             •      Number and deployment or utilization of decontamination personnel.
             •      Selection of appropriate decontaminant and decontamination equipment.
             •      Selection of an effective method of decontamination.
             •      Selection of a site for decontamination of equipment, supplies, and
personnel.
             (7)    Human Factor Effects of MOPP.
                  (a) Physiological and psychological stress will occur during
decontamination operations. Body temperature must be maintained within a narrow limit
for optimum physical and mental performance. MOPP gear restricts the heat loss
mechanisms because of its high insulation and low permeability to water vapor. In
addition, physical work requires more effort when personnel wear protective clothing
because of its added weight and restricted movement. Work intensity, which is managed by
leaders, is also a major contributing factor to heat stress.
                (b) Military personnel wearing MOPP while conducting decontamination
may experience heat stress. To prevent heat stress from resulting in injuries, they follow a
prescribed cycle of work and rest periods. See Table II-1 for work/rest cycles and water
replacement guidelines. The work/rest cycles are based on the environment (temperature,
humidity, and solar load), the workload of the individual, and the clothing ensemble being
worn. These work/rest cycles are usually described in terms of minutes of work allowed per
hour. The remainder of the hour (after completing the work allowed) is used for rest,
allowing heat to dissipate and allowing the individual to cool down. The local application of
work/rest cycles is directly influenced by METT-TC.

          (8) Logistics Burden of CBRN Attacks. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques
and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection.
            (9) Effects of CBRN Attacks on C2 Systems. CBRN attacks can degrade C2
systems. Effective decontamination operations rely on a C2 system that keeps the
commander informed and communicates the commander’s intent. For example, being
notified of the commander’s priorities for decontamination is critical for ensuring that
support is synchronized.
           (10) Capabilities and Limitations of US, Multinational, and HN
Decontamination Assets. In preparation for multinational operations, unit planners assess
coalition member CBRN capabilities for decontamination and interoperability with US
forces. The planning process should consider the implications and feasibility of diverting
US assets and capabilities to support HN and other multinational members in
accomplishing the required decontamination objectives.
          (11) OCONUS CM Support. OCONUS CM support will generally be
characterized by crisis action planning. A CBRN or TIM incident may result in US forces
providing OCONUS decontamination support. The support would probably be for a short
duration and would require extensive coordination and liaison with the HN.
      b.     International Coalition Operations. Decontamination may be conducted within
the context of multinational arrangements. Planning is accomplished through both US and
multinational channels. Coordinated CBRN defense planning is essential to the unity
effort (e.g., operations; logistics (including infrastructure); intelligence; deception;
decontamination; warning, detection, and monitoring; CM; and CBRN interoperability).
Supporting plans that address coordination and liaison, host nation support (HNS), and the
provision of mutual support are examples of the essential tasks that must be accomplished.
4.     Homeland Security Planning Considerations
    Decontamination support for HLS and CS present unique planning considerations.
CBRN decontamination planning ranges from planning to provide technical assistance and
recommendations to planning for resources for mass decontamination. The following are
examples of planning considerations that apply for HLS and CS:
     •     CBRN specialists and planners understand and can operate within the civilian
based incident command system (ICS).
    •      CBRN specialists and planners understand the terms of reference used to
support first-responder decontamination operations.
      •     CBRN specialists conduct planning with civilian counterparts at the federal,
state, or local level, as applicable.
     •     CBRN specialists and planners train and exercise for support of HLS or CS
operations.
    •     CBRN specialists, as required, maintain the required certification to operate in a
CS mission with civilian first responders.
     •    Military issue of the IPE (MOPP ensembles) do not meet Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) Level C requirements.

5.   Preattack Decontamination Operations
     Preattack decontamination actions are taken to increase readiness.
     a.     Preattack Considerations. Preattack considerations extend from the present
until the first enemy weapon effects occur within the theater of operations.
           (1) Commanders will conduct VA and estimate the need for decontamination
based on the threat, the resources available for decontamination, and the potential results
of this operation. Preattack actions also consider the following:
           •    Assessing the CBRN threat.
           •    Identifying and preparing collective protective shelters (CPSs) and MTFs.
           •    Ensuring the proficiency in CBRN decontamination procedures and
methods.
           •    Preparing to conduct decontamination operations (based on the nature and
extent of contamination and resources available for decontamination).
          •     Preparing to conduct response procedures (before and after a CBRN
attack). Guidance must be based on the concept that there may be no warning before an
attack and that all attacks in a high-threat area may contain CBRN agents.
           •    Providing instructions for a warning unit or the base populace.
          •    Notifying key personnel of an attack, of procedures for the activation of
preselected CPSs, and of the need to don the protective clothing.
          •     Decontaminating mission-essential facilities (see Appendix I for
information on terrain decontamination).
           •    Identifying recovery actions that must begin as soon as possible after the
attack.
           (2) Subordinate units and activities must support and comply with the
commander’s intent. They develop contingency plans for CBRN defense actions that
support missions conducted within the theater assigned. Plans must address CBRN
detection, warning, reporting, and decontaminating procedures and a rapid transition into
a CBRN defensive posture.
            (3) Specialized CBRN teams will be formed from existing personnel resources
to detect, identify, and decontaminate CBRN contamination and to operate protective
shelters.
           (4) Each soldier must be trained to perform decontamination of his own body,
clothing, personal equipment, individual weapons, and casualties.
      b.    Reconnaissance/Site Survey of Decontamination Sites. Decontamination site
selection is necessary during preattack operational and thorough decontamination
planning. The following criteria should be considered for decontamination site selection:
     •     Wind direction (to include downwind direction from friendly personnel).
     •     Water supply.
     •     Overhead concealment.



4 April 2006               FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60               II-7
       •    Maximum use of existing facilities.
       •    Drainage.
     •    Trafficability. The path or road must be able to withstand large amounts of
water being placed on it.
     •   Accessibility. The site should be accessible to the largest vehicle in the
contaminated unit.
     •   Size. The area must be large enough to handle all stations of the level of
decontamination being conducted, especially Station 3 of thorough decontamination.
       c.   Site and Linkup Point Selection.
           (1) The controlling headquarters (HQ) selects the potential decontamination
sites as part of mission planning. More than likely, this HQ will only be capable of a map
reconnaissance. For decontamination sites on the friendly side of the forward line of own
troops (FLOT), every effort must be made to conduct a ground reconnaissance of the site.
For thorough decontamination and supported operational decontamination, it is imperative
that these sites be further reconnaissanced by the supporting decontamination unit. For
example, when an operational decontamination is executed by an Army battalion, the
battalion CBRN noncommissioned officer (NCO) should make every attempt to reconnoiter
these sites.
           (2) As decontamination sites are selected (during the map reconnaissance), one
or more linkup points are chosen to support each site. Linkup at the designated point
includes establishing security, positioning the necessary marshalling areas, camouflaging
the entry and exit points, designating the direction of flow into and out of the site, and
ensuring that the unit’s supply or prestaged embarked assets have sufficient replacement
MOPP gear.
       d.   Coordination.
           (1) The individual in charge of decontamination must make careful
coordination with those elements involved to ensure the successful completion of the
operation. The unit to be decontaminated must be aware of linkup points, times, and its
own responsibilities for the procedure.
          (2) Much of the coordination will be arranged through the decontamination
element or the unit’s higher echelon, particularly when involving the following:
            •    Power-driven decontamination equipment (PDDE) support.
            •    Engineer support for site preparation and closure.
            •    Supply and transportation for linkup with bulk water trucks.
            •    Air defense and security forces for security when those elements are
required.
            •    HSS.
            •    Augmentee support.
           •    Support of medical patient decontamination operations (if the MTF is
colocated adjacent to troop decontamination).



II-8                    FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60       4 April 2006
     e.   Communications. Primary communications between the decontamination
element and the supported unit will be via radio. Therefore, signal operating instructions
(SOI) should be included in the supported unit’s initial request for decontamination
support.
     f.    Maintaining SA.
            (1) Warnings. Warnings of CBRN contamination are conveyed by alarms and
signals. Units use easily recognizable and reliable alarm methods to respond quickly and
reliably to CBRN hazards. Standard alarms, the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
Warning and Reporting System (NBCWRS), and contamination markers help give orderly
warning that may also require a change of MOPP level. Alarms and signals may include
the following:
           •     Audible alarms.
           •     Automatic alarms.
           •     Visual signals.
           (2) Markings. Contamination is marked to warn friendly personnel. Units or
CBRN reconnaissance teams mark the likely entry points into the area and report
contamination to higher HQ. The only exception is when marking would help the enemy.
In this event, the hazard is reported to higher HQ as an unmarked contaminated area.
When a unit enters a previously marked contaminated area, personnel check the extent of
contamination and adjust plans as necessary. As the hazard area changes, the unit
relocates the signs. When the hazard passes, the unit removes the signs. The unit reports
all changes to higher HQ. The decontamination site noncommissioned officer in charge
(NCOIC) ensures that his team properly marks the decontamination site with the standard
markings and sends the NBC5 (areas of actual contamination) report forward.
           (3)   Control Measures.
                 (a) Ensure that drivers of contaminated vehicles know when to move into
position at the wash-down location.
                 (b)   Ensure that the contaminated unit has provided site security.
               (c)     See Appendix J for thorough decontamination station signs used as
control measures.
           (4) Wide-area data flow (Web site) provides up-to-date status, information, and
conditions across a broad spectrum.
      g.  Maintenance of Decontamination Equipment. A thorough operator level
maintenance should be done on all decontamination equipment. If no mission-capable
equipment is found, all the shortcomings should be forwarded to higher echelons so that the
force commander is aware of the full decontamination capability.
      h.   Pre-positioning of Logistics. Units will need to pre-position the replacement IPE
for issue at the end of the DED as part of the thorough decontamination. If replacement
IPE is needed during operational decontamination, the unit should pre-position the IPE for
use during MOPP gear exchange. As the CBRN threat rises, IPE and chemical
decontamination equipment should be pre-positioned forward to ensure timely delivery to
units for operational and thorough decontamination.

        i.   Other Preattack Actions. Other key preattack actions are included in Table II-2.
                             Table II-2. Preattack Decontamination Actions
                    • Know the current and future missions.
                    • Outline the capabilities of the unit or activity.
                    • Know the external support available from CBRN units.
                    • Know the decontamination support available to detached/remote elements.
                    • Designate the decontamination sites.
                    • Employ avoidance (whenever possible) within the context of the mission.
                    • Designate the TFAs.
                    • Establish and exercise the CBRN warning and reporting system.

6.      Execution
     Actions necessary to successfully execute decontamination operations include
establishing a C2 site, establishing clean areas or zones, ensuring security, providing
proper and detailed reporting, ensuring the availability of resources, and controlling and
documenting personnel exposure.
     a.   Decontamination Site C2. In a thorough decontamination, the supported unit is
responsible for overall control. The level that an operational decontamination operation is
being conducted determines C2 for the decontamination site. There are different levels (or
techniques) of control when conducting operational decontamination.
          (1) Decentralized Operational Decontamination. The unit commander
requests decontamination equipment support, selects the decontamination site, links up
with the decontamination element, and conducts the decontamination.
           (2) Centralized Operational Decontamination. The CBRN staff controls the
decontamination. The commander selects the site, and the battalion CBRN staff directs
site setup and security and provides C2. The CBRN staff officer or NCO travels with the
decontamination element and communicates via radio.
     b.    Establishment of Clean Areas and Zones. A predecontamination staging area is
established downwind of the decontamination site. In the predecontamination staging
area, the supported commander segregates vehicles by checking for contamination. Clean
areas must be provided to avoid recontaminating personnel and equipment as they finish
the decontamination process. The decontamination element should be set upwind of the
decontamination site entrance. The MOPP gear exchange should be in place upwind and at
a 45° angle of vehicle wash down. After processing, the vehicles should marshal in a
postdecontamination assembly area (AA) upwind of the DTD and DED areas.
     c.    Security. Security ensures that the decontamination operation is conducted
without interference. The supported unit is responsible for site security. Cover and
concealment must be considered in decontamination site selection. Traffic control is
another component of security. Linkup points and the entrances to AAs should be
controlled to ensure that uncontaminated personnel or vehicles do not enter.
     d.    Reporting. Proper and detailed reporting is critical to the success of the
decontamination operation and to the restoration operations that will occur at the end of
the conflict. At the end of the decontamination operation, several things must be reported.



II-10                     FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                    4 April 2006
The CBRN unit will be responsible for submitting a complete NBC5 report after the site is
closed. The supported unit will report the following to its higher HQ:
     •     Quantity and types of vehicles decontaminated.
     •     Number of personnel decontaminated through the DTD.
     •     Number of causalities.
     •     Time decontamination site was opened and closed.
     e.   Consumption Rates. Decontamination operations expend resources. The
chemical unit must plan to have enough of the proper supplies on hand to perform its
mission. For information on consumption rates, see Chapter XII.
      f.   Resupply. After a decontamination operation, the CBRN unit must restore itself
to mission-capable status. While the supported unit has the requirement to keep on-hand
supplies to conduct a DTD, the supporting CBRN unit may supply the majority of the
equipment and supplies expended. Likewise, while the supported unit is required to
provide the chemical unit with replacement supplies and material at the end of a DED, the
CBRN unit should make its material requirements known to the maneuver forces logistics
staff. The logistics staff may then arrange for decontamination supplies to be issued, often
in “push” packages.
     g.   Personnel Exposure Control and Documentation. During decontamination
operations, steps should be taken to limit the exposure of personnel to the contamination.
Such measures include the decontamination crews wearing toxicological aprons or
wet-weather gear over MOPP gear and locating post decontamination AAs upwind. The
accurate documentation of individual exposure to contaminants will be essential for proper
medical treatment should those personnel become injured.
7.   Postdecontamination Operations
    Postdecontamination operations provide for the restoration of combat power to the
commander.
     a.   Immediately following an attack, recovery operations will be initiated.
Operations related to mission-essential operations may continue in a contaminated
environment. Those personnel not immediately required to ensure the continuation of
mission-essential activities will likely remain in their shelters until the hazard dissipates
or decontamination efforts allow resumption of their normal duties.
     b.    Postattack operations involve assessing the degree of mission degradation after
the attack and reporting postattack readiness.
     c.    Commanders will ensure that postattack operations emphasize those actions
necessary to restore mission and support functions. Representative postattack actions
include the following:
     •     Assessing damage and casualties.
     •     Restoring communications for C2.
     •   Detecting, identifying, marking, isolating, decontaminating, and reporting
contaminated areas and equipment.
     •     Performing casualty decontamination.

      d.    After completion of operational or thorough decontamination, units close out the
sites used for MOPP gear exchange, vehicle wash down, DED, and DTD. In a thorough
decontamination, the DED is closed first. The CBRN unit then processes through the DTD
and the DTD is closed. Then the CBRN unit marks the area as a contaminated area and
reports its exact location to the supported unit using an NBC4 report. See Chapters IV and
V for procedures to close a site.

                       IMMEDIATE DECONTAMINATION 


1.   Background
     Once aware of chemical-biological (CB) contamination on the bare skin, initiate
immediate decontamination techniques, without command, by using the personal
skin decontamination kit (SDK). Decontaminate the hood, mask, gloves, and
weapon using the individual equipment decontamination kit (IEDK). To remove
radiological contamination from equipment and personnel, brush it off and wash the
area with soap and water.
NOTE: Throughout this manual, SDK refers to the M291 kit and IEDK
refers to the M295 kit.
2.   Skin Decontamination
    Start the skin decontamination techniques within 1 minute of becoming contaminated.
Some toxic chemical agents, especially nerve agents, kill within minutes.
     a.    Chemical.
           (1) Use the SDK within 1 minute of contamination of the exposed skin.
Instructions for its use are listed on the individual packet within the kit. Flushing the eyes
with water is also a critical immediate decontamination action and should occur as soon as
possible following contamination.
           (2) If an SDK is not available, chemical contamination may be blotted from the
skin with a cloth and flushed with water from a canteen. Soap (if available) can be used to
wash the agent from the skin. Washing with soap and water (preferably warm water) is
the best method for toxic-agent removal if SDKs are not available, but this method is not as
effective as using the decontamination kits.
     b.    Biological. Immediately decontaminate using soap and water when there is a
suspected exposure to a BW agent. Careful washing removes nearly all the agent from the
skin’s surface. Hypochlorite solution or other disinfectants are reserved for gross
contamination (e.g., following the spill of a solid or liquid agent from a munition directly
onto the skin). Grossly contaminated skin surfaces should be washed with a 0.5 percent
chlorine solution, if available, with a contact time of 10 to 15 minutes. See Appendix C for
details on how to make this solution.
      c.   Radiological. To remove radiological dust particles, brush, wash, or wipe them
off. If MOPP gear is wet, conduct a MOPP gear exchange as soon as possible because
brushing or shaking will not remove the contamination. Wash the exposed areas of the
skin with soap and water, and pay particular attention to the hair and fingernails.
3.   Personal Wipe Down
     The personal wipe down technique is most effective when done within 15 minutes of
being contaminated. Using the IEDK, wipe down the mask, hood, gloves, and other
essential gear. Use the M295 IEDK, an M291 SDK pad, a stick, or any stiff device to
remove the gross contamination from the protective overgarment. Scrape any clumps off



4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60               III-1
the material. Brush off radiological contamination or frozen chemical-agent contamination.
See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
(NBC) Protection for detailed information on overgarment protective qualities.
     a.   Chemical. Decontaminate individual equipment using the IEDKs. The ICAMs,
chemical-agent monitors (CAMs), and M8/M9 detector paper are used to detect
contamination and monitor the level of contamination on the equipment.
     b.   Biological. Wash with soap and water. If water is not available, use IEDKs in
the same manner as described for chemical-agent decontamination.
     c.    Radiological. Locate radiological contamination with monitoring equipment and
remove by brushing or shaking it off. Avoid breathing the dust particles by wearing the
protective mask or a piece of cloth over the nose and mouth. Wipe off the equipment with
soapy water (preferably warm) using rags or damp paper towels.
4.      Operator Wipe Down
     Decontaminate other mission-essential surfaces of the equipment before continuing
the mission. Operators wipe down is most effective when done within 15 minutes of
contamination.
        a.   Chemical.
           (1) Decontaminate the surfaces that must be touched on the exterior of the
vehicle or the equipment with the M100 SDS. If the M100 SDS is unavailable, scrub the
surfaces with super tropical bleach (STB) to decontaminate the equipment.
NOTE: The M100 has not been authorized for use on USN or USMC aircraft. Use
hot, soapy water to perform operator’s wipe down on all aircraft. Also, STB
should not be used to decontaminate aircraft surfaces.
           (2) Scrub STB dry mix or slurry onto the exterior surface with brushes (if
available). Wait 30 minutes, and then wash it off. If necessary, use the nonstandard
decontaminants that are discussed in Appendix C. The ICAM, CAM, and M8/M9 detector
paper are used to determine what surfaces require decontamination.
     b.    Biological. For decontamination of equipment, a 0.5 percent chlorine solution
should be used, if available. A contact time of 30 minutes prior to normal cleaning is
required. Bleach is corrosive to most metals and fabrics so rinse thoroughly and oil the
metal surfaces after completion. Other nonstandard biological decontaminants are
described in Appendix C.
NOTE: Bleach has not been authorized for use on USN or USMC aircraft. Use hot
soapy water to perform operators wipe down on all aircraft.
     c.     Radiological. If surfaces are contaminated by fallout, rain out, neutron-induced
contaminations, or any type of radiological agent, use the monitoring equipment to help
locate it and then decontaminate the surfaces as required. Decontaminate if detection
equipment is not available and contamination is suspected. Radiological contamination can
usually be removed by brushing or scraping. Water is effective for flushing away
radiological contamination; however, use drainage ditches that flow into a sump to control
the runoff. Remember, the contamination has not been destroyed, it has just been moved.
The runoff will still be hazardous. If time permits, brush or scoop away the top inch of soil
from the fighting position to lower the effects of radiological contamination.

5.   Spot Decontamination
     a.    Purpose. Aircrews and aircraft ground support crews can use spot
decontamination as an immediate measure to remove contamination from critical locations.
Spot decontamination is performed to limit the spread of contamination on aircraft that
requires servicing between sorties, to support ingress and egress of aircraft by crews and
passengers, and when performing pre- and postflight inspections. Spot decontamination
reduces the contamination on the areas that must be touched during servicing.
     b.    Procedures.
          (1) Ensure that sufficient quantities of soapy water or applicable aircraft
cleaner and fresh water are available.
          (2) Scrub service areas with soapy water using brushes, rags, or sponges until
deposited material, dirt, and grime are removed.
           (3)   Rinse areas with fresh water from a bucket or hose.
           (4) Ensure that service providers decontaminate gloves (SDK, soapy water, or
high-test hypochlorite [HTH] solution).
           (5)   Perform service on the aircraft.
           (6) Decontaminate runoff by applying a standard or nonstandard
decontaminant to the deck/ground/airfield. Runoff can be hosed overboard or into collection
sumps. If runoff is hosed without prior decontamination, it should be treated as
contaminated.

                      OPERATIONAL DECONTAMINATION 


1.   Background
      Operational decontamination limits the spread and transfer of contamination, allows
temporary relief from MOPP4, and facilitates additional decontamination requirements.
By speeding up the weathering process, the need for a thorough decontamination may be
eliminated. This chapter focuses on land forces operational decontamination TTP. This
process will likely require about a 120-square-yard area (depending on the number of
contaminated vehicles) and may not require a nearby water source. An operational
decontamination consists of a vehicle wash down and a MOPP gear exchange. The
techniques that may be used to conduct an operational decontamination include the
following:
     •     Decentralized control for a company-size unit.
     •     Centralized control for a battalion-size unit.
     •     Centralized control for a brigade-size unit.

2.   Planning
     Operational decontamination requires a well-thought-out plan to be successful. The
advantages and disadvantages of operational decontamination techniques are listed in
Table IV-1, page IV-2.

      a.    Decentralized control of a company-size element undergoing decontamination is
provided by the contaminated unit’s commander. The advantages of this method are that it
is flexible and it conforms to the METT-TC conditions. It also disperses the units over a
large area, making them less vulnerable to attack by the enemy. The disadvantages are
that C2 is more difficult, it is difficult to synchronize the support assets to one location, it
may require rehearsal time, it takes more time overall, planning assets are not available at
that level, and the company cannot sustain operations without additional support from
higher HQ.
     b.    Centralized control of a battalion-size unit is similar to the above except that the
unit CBRN NCO controls the decontamination. The unit commander and the CBRN NCO
direct the site setup and provide security and C2 for the selected site. The CBRN NCO
travels with the decontamination element and communicates via the radio.
     c.   Centralized control for a brigade-size unit is done when decontamination assets
within the brigade have been consolidated. In this technique, the brigade CBRN NCO
performs those functions described for the battalion CBRN NCO.
3.     Phases
      The three phases for an operational decontamination are preparation, execution, and
site clearance (see Table IV-2).

                    Ensure that the site has good overhead concealment.
                    Ensure that the site has food and water sources (plan for 100 gallons of water per vehicle).
                    Ensure that the site has good drainage.
Linkup              Ensure that the NCOIC knows where to link up with the contaminated unit and knows the location
                    for site setup. Radio communication is essential for the operations.
                    Ensure that the decontamination element is positioned properly and ready to dispense hot, soapy

                    Ensure that the contaminated unit sets up and operates the MOPP gear exchange at the same
                    time as the vehicle wash down. Consider contamination runoff when positioning the
                    decontamination element.
                                                      Execution
Site control        Ensure that the drivers of the contaminated vehicles know when to move into position at the
                    wash-down location.
                    Ensure that the contaminated unit has provided site security.

      a.        Preparation.
           (1) The preparation phase starts with the decision to conduct an operational
decontamination and ends with a site that is set up and ready for operation. The
ICAM/CAM is used to identify which vehicles need decontaminating, and decontamination
support is requested.
           (2) Coordination with higher HQ includes identifying the linkup point and the
unit that will provide the decontamination support. SOI are exchanged, and the technique
(decentralized company-size control, centralized battalion size control, or centralized
brigade-size control) is selected. The number and type of vehicles and the number of
personnel for a MOPP gear exchange are provided.
          (3) Site selection is done by the controlling HQ. The site may have been
designated in the OPORD or selected based on the current METT-TC.
          (4) Linkup at the designated point includes establishing security, positioning
necessary marshalling areas, camouflaging removal points, designating the direction of flow
into and out of the site, and ensuring that unit supply has sufficient replacement MOPP
gear.




4 April 2006                   FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                                  IV-3
          (5) Site setup requires the decontamination crew to position itself upwind from
the entrance, set up the MOPP gear exchange about 164 feet upwind from the vehicle wash
down at a 45° angle, and notify the contaminated unit when the site is ready.
       b.   Execution.
          (1) The execution phase starts with establishing positive control over the site
and ends with processing the last contaminated vehicle and person through the site.
Vehicles move from the predecontamination area to the site upon order or by watching the
vehicle ahead. The assistant driver leaves the vehicle and proceeds to the MOPP gear
exchange point. The contaminated unit provides security. Throughout the execution
phase, periodic wind checks should be performed to ensure that the wind has not shifted
and placed the soldiers conducting the MOPP gear exchange in a CBRN hazard.
           (2) Each vehicle receives a 2- to 4-minute wash down with hot, soapy water
and moves to a point near the MOPP gear exchange area. Vehicles can be washed with
cold, soapy water or only cold water when hot, soapy water is not available. Any remaining
personnel requiring a MOPP gear exchange will get one then. When the squad or crew has
finished, personnel remount the vehicles and move into an after-decontamination AA to
await further instructions or move to their next battle position.
            (3)   Vehicle Wash Down.
                (a) A vehicle wash down may be conducted with or without standard
decontamination equipment in a one- or two-lane configuration. An unsupported wash
down requires the contaminated unit to use its assigned decontamination apparatuses or
other alternate washing equipment that can produce 60 to 120 pounds per square inch (psi)
of water pressure. The capacity to heat water and inject soap increases the effectiveness. A
supported wash down requires decontamination equipment assets that are organic to the
unit or from a supporting decontamination unit. A two-lane wash down is simply two
one-lane wash downs parallel to each other (see Figure IV-1).

                (b) Other configurations are limited only by the constraints of the
METT-TC. Figure IV-2 illustrates a dispersed operational decontamination setup. Table

                           Sufficient water, fuel, and detergent for
                           vehicles.
4. Move to AA.             None                                          Vehicles move to the MOPP gear
                                                                         exchange area (if required) or the next
                                                                         battle position.

      (4) MOPP Gear Exchange. A MOPP gear exchange can be done with a buddy team,
a triple buddy team, or an individual (emergency). For planning purposes, estimate 30
minutes for a squad or a platoon-size element to complete the exchange. Since individual
performance is severely degraded after 6 hours at MOPP4, the MOPP gear exchange should
be scheduled before that time.
           (a) Buddy Team Method. This method uses pairs of warfighters under the
supervision of their squad leader/team leader (TL) to conduct the buddy team MOPP gear
exchange. See Table IV-4 for the procedures for the buddy team method MOPP gear
exchange with the joint-service, lightweight, integrated suit technology (JSLIST). See
Table IV-5, page IV-11, for BDO MOPP gear exchange steps. See Table IV-6, page IV-19,
for the step-by-step procedures for units equipped with the combat vehicle crewman
uniform system (CVCUS)/chemical protective undergarment (CPU).
            (b) Triple Buddy Team Method. This method is used by personnel equipped
with the M40A1, M42, or M43 mask with the quick-doff hood. A third person is needed to
hold the filter canister and hose to prevent pulling the mask away from the person’s face.
See Table IV-7, page IV-23, for the step-by-step procedures for this method. For units
equipped with the CVCUS/CPU, see Table IV-8, page IV-28.
          (c) Individual (Emergency) Method. This method is used only when a person
does not have a buddy to help him and the risk of MOPP gear failure demands that an
exchange occur. See Table IV-9, page IV-32, for the step-by-step procedures for this
method. For units equipped with the CVCUS/CPU, see Table IV-10, page IV-36. For the
procedures for the individual (emergency) method of MOPP gear exchange with the
JSLIST, see Table IV-11, page IV-39.

      c.    Site Clearance. The site clearance phase includes cleanup, marking, and
reporting. METT-TC will dictate the cleanup requirements. Contaminated waste is
collected from the operational decontamination. See Appendix K for information on site
clearance procedures.

                      THOROUGH DECONTAMINATION 


1.   Background
       a.   Thorough decontamination operations reduce and sometimes eliminate
contamination from equipment and personnel. This allows the MOPP level to be reduced.
Operators and crew members must perform periodic checks on their equipment since there
is a risk of residual contamination. Operators make these checks with standard detectors
(e.g., M8/M9 paper, ICAM/CAM) and the M256A1 kit. This chapter focuses on land force
decontamination operations as part of ongoing combat operations or reconstitution
operations.
     b.   Combat service support (CSS) elements replenish combat stocks, refit
equipment, and replace personnel and equipment, as required. The contaminated unit,
with some assistance from a decontamination unit, performs the DTD.
NOTE: The USN and the USMC do not have standing CBRN support units to
perform decontamination. See Appendix G for service CBRN decontamination
capabilities.
     c.   A supporting CBRN unit performs the DED or DAD. The planning
considerations that are required to conduct a thorough decontamination operation and the
methods that various decontamination units use to conduct DTD/DED are discussed in this
chapter. The exact layout of a thorough decontamination site is determined by the
METT-TC. After a thorough decontamination operation, the unit moves out of the
decontamination site into a tactical AA. The unit, while in this tactical assembly, may
undergo reconstitution or may prepare for future operations.

2.    Planning
    Thorough decontamination is the most effective type of decontamination, but it is the
most resource-intensive.
      a.    Thorough decontamination operations are conducted beyond the range of enemy
direct-fire systems. If a contaminated unit requires a thorough decontamination as part of
its reconstitution operations, the decontamination site is established near the
reconstitution area or the parent unit rear area. Company-size units are usually
reconstituted in the brigade rear area while battalion-level units are reconstituted in the
division rear area.
      b.    All echelons prepare for thorough decontamination operations as part of the
overall planning process. The CBRN staff can begin to develop the decontamination plan
from the commander’s general guidance. Coordination with higher HQ is required to
determine the availability of engineer support for site preparation and closure. Engineers
provide support for sumps and drainage ditches. They also coordinate with the civil affairs
office for HNS (personnel, equipment, and supplies) and for environmental requirements
and restrictions.
     c.    The CBRN staff selects possible lineup points throughout the unit area of
operation (AO) based on such factors as the decontamination type, terrain, mission, threat,
road network, and availability of water. Decontamination site locations that support these
lineup points are finalized after reconnaissance of the sites by the decontamination platoon.
After the decontamination sites are selected, linkup points are chosen to support each site.
A site may have more than one linkup point.
      d.    Since decontamination assets are limited, the commander must establish
priorities of decontamination support and list the units in the order they will be
decontaminated. This can change from phase to phase during an operation. The CBRN
staff develops the priority of support based on an understanding of the commander’s intent.
     e.     Giving the priority of support to the lead task force during the assault phase may
not be the best choice since the contaminated elements will not stop for decontamination
until after the assault is complete. The commander should establish a priority of work that
specifies the order in which equipment will be decontaminated. (For example, a priority of
work may be in this order: engineer equipment, artillery pieces, main battle tanks, and
long-haul vehicles.) Ships with embarked amphibious and aviation units will have to
prioritize similarly, as will aviation units operating ashore. A limiting factor is the
availability of water. A typical vehicle requires 500 gallons of water during the DED. The
actual amount of water required varies by the vehicle and its contamination level. The
supported unit CBRN staff must develop a water resupply plan for thorough
decontamination operations.
     f.    A water resupply plan can be as simple as selecting a series of linkup points
along a route where the chemical unit can link up with a bulk water truck. More complex
water resupply plans include caching water throughout the AO, coordinating for the
movement of water bladders by aircraft, and identifying water sources in the unit AO. The
use of nonpotable, salt, and brackish waters should be considered. See Table V-1 for the
planning factors for the rinse station.

3.    Preparation
      Units prepare for thorough decontamination to be successful.
     a.    Subordinate units review their higher HQ decontamination plan. If additional
decontamination sites or assets are required, they request them from the higher HQ. The
supporting decontamination leader conducts a reconnaissance of the designated
decontamination sites. Since the decontamination sites are initially selected by map
reconnaissance, the actual site may not be suitable. If the selected site cannot support
decontamination operations, the CBRN unit leader attempts to find another site close to
the original site and notifies the supported unit and higher HQ of the change.
     b.    The decontamination unit leader determines the support requirements that are
needed to operate the decontamination site. Engineers are required to dig sumps, improve
access to the site, and dig ditches for runoff. Air defense and military police are required to
provide security. Medical support is also required. Depending on the operational situation
and the threat, some DED sites may be prepared in advance. Routes must be established
and published in the OPORD, leading the contaminated unit to the linkup point.
NOTE: Inform units not to proceed directly to the decontamination site.
4.    Execution
       The actual decontamination operation begins once a contaminated unit requests
decontamination support. The unit leader must assess the situation and accurately report
it to the HQ. This situation report (SITREP) should include the type and extent of
contamination, the current location, the unit’s ability to perform the current mission while
contaminated, and the time the unit will become ineffective in combat. The contaminated
unit should perform immediate decontamination techniques to increase its survivability
and to limit the spread of contamination. An operational decontamination should also be
considered and performed, as appropriate. The request for decontamination support must
contain several essential elements of information to assist the CBRN staff and the
decontamination unit leader in coordinating the decontamination operation. These
essential elements of information include the following:
      •     Designation of the contaminated unit.
      •     Location of the contaminated unit.
      •     Time the unit became contaminated.

      •     Time the unit can move and begin decontamination.
      •     Type of contamination.
      •     Number and type of vehicles contaminated.
     •   Special requirements (e.g., patient decontamination station, recovery assets, unit
decontamination team).
      •     Supported unit’s frequency and call sign to facilitate initial linkup.
     a.   The supporting decontamination unit is given a WARNORD to conduct a
decontamination operation. Subsequent WARNORDs provide more detailed information.
After requesting decontamination support, the supported unit issues an
OPORD/fragmentary order (FRAGORD) to the chemical unit.
     b.  The supporting decontamination unit must coordinate the movement of the
contaminated unit to the linkup point. If the contaminated unit is out of the supported unit
AO, the move must be coordinated with the higher HQ.
     c.   Once the chemical unit is set up, the decontamination unit leader moves to the
linkup point. Other elements may provide assets to support the decontamination
operations, such as medical, engineer, air defense, and military police. These elements link
up with the chemical unit before the arrival of the contaminated unit (see Table V-2).
     d.   The supported unit is responsible for site security and overall control. The
decontamination leader is responsible for operating the predecontamination area and for
processing vehicles.
     e.    After linkup is achieved and all support assets are in position, the actual
decontamination operation begins. The decontamination platoon leader, with help from the
commander of the contaminated unit or the supported unit C2 cell, supervises the
decontamination operation. All equipment not necessary for decontamination operations
should be located in an uncontaminated area to limit the spread of contamination.

     f.    A thorough decontamination site consists of the following areas:
     •     Predecontamination staging area.
     •     DED area.
     •     DTD area.
     •     Postdecontamination AA.
      g.   There should be an alternate route for vehicles that have been decontaminated
but did not pass the M8 paper or ICAM test. This limits the spread of contamination by not
exposing clean vehicles with vehicles that might need to be reprocessed back though the
DED. The chemical unit leader selects these areas based on operational guidance, the road
network, available cover and concealment, and the water supply. The contaminated unit
uses the predecontamination staging area to ready itself. The postdecontamination AA is
the location where the vehicles and personnel exiting the DED and DTD areas are linked
up before moving from the decontamination site (see Figure V-1).

5.    Predecontamination Staging Area
     The contaminated unit moves to the predecontamination staging area about 500
meters downwind of the thorough decontamination site. The contaminated unit performs
predecontamination actions, to include segregating vehicles by checking for contamination.
     a.    For chemical contamination, use the ICAM/CAM and the M8/M9 detector paper.
When monitoring vehicles for contamination, there should be about 15 meters between each
vehicle to prevent false positive readings with the ICAM. For radiological contamination,
use the AN/PDR-77, AN/VDR-2, or ADM-300 radiac detector.
     b.  If the vehicle only has isolated areas of contamination, use the M100 to
decontaminate those areas. Recheck for contamination, and consider the vehicle clean if
contamination is not detected.
NOTE: Do not use the M100 on sensitive items.
6.    Vehicle Crews
      Vehicle crews play an integral part in the thorough decontamination process.
     a.    The vehicle crews, except for the drivers, dismount. As the crews dismount, they
remove all contaminated equipment, including sensitive items (i.e. electro-optical), from the
top and sides of the vehicles. Once the crews have exited the vehicle, they will not reenter.
This prevents contamination from being spread into the vehicle interior.
      b.   Using the pioneer tools from the contaminated vehicles, the crew removes all
heavy mud and debris. They concentrate on the undercarriage, which would be the most
likely place for contamination to collect and the hardest place to decontaminate. Once the
crew is finished with the pioneer tools, they are placed back on the vehicle. The initial
removal of the mud and debris makes it more likely that the decontamination wash will
remove any remaining contamination.
     c.    Seat covers (when applicable), canvas items, camouflage netting, wooden rails,
and any other material that can absorb liquid contamination are removed. These items
create a potential transfer hazard and are not easily decontaminated. Left untreated,
absorbed chemical agents will desorb after being decontaminated and will create a vapor
hazard. The crew removes the items that cannot be decontaminated by the standard
methods used in the DTD and places them at the collection point. Decontamination unit
personnel provide advice concerning the decontamination or disposal of these items.
     d.    Design vehicle-loading plans to minimize the amount of equipment carried on
the outside of the vehicle that cannot be readily decontaminated. Whenever possible,
CBRN covers should be used when a chemical attack is expected (see Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection). All CBRN
covers are removed and disposed of as contaminated waste during the predecontamination
actions.
     e.   Equipment and supplies that are exposed after removal of coverings should be
checked for contamination. If the items that can be removed are uncontaminated, they
should be moved via a clean route to the postdecontamination area. Contaminated
equipment and supplies will be decontaminated or disposed of properly.

7. Detailed Equipment Decontamination and Detailed Troop Decontamination
Areas
     In coordination with the CBRN unit leader operating the decontamination site, the
contaminated unit begins sending contaminated vehicles by priority for processing.
Communication is maintained between the predecontamination staging area and the CBRN
unit leaders. All assistant vehicle drivers are the first individuals sent through the DTD to
ensure that there is a driver exchange at Station 3. See Appendix J for a series of charts to
support DED station attendants and supervisors.
     a.    Postdecontamination AA. The CBRN unit leader selects the general location for
the post decontamination AA. It must be big enough to hold the entire unit and to provide
the proper cover and concealment while undergoing the thorough decontamination. The
postdecontamination AA is located about 1 kilometer (km) upwind from the DED and DTD
areas. The unit assembles in the postdecontamination AA after completing the DTD and
DED operations. The unit occupies the postdecontamination AA until the entire unit has
gone through decontamination and will then be instructed to move to a reconstitution
location or a tactical AA to prepare for future operations.
      b.   Decontamination Sumps. The construction of decontamination sumps will be
required to control the wastewater runoff from various stations in the DED and for the
disposal of expendable supplies from the DED or DTD. The sumps should be of an
appropriate size and volume for the station that requires the sump. To prevent the spread
of contamination into the ground and to assist in the weathering process, each sump should
be lined with a sufficient amount of STB. See Appendix K for a discussion on
contaminated-waste disposal.
      c.   DTD. The contaminated unit or its higher HQ is responsible for setting up,
operating, manning, and closing the DTD area at the thorough-decontamination site. The
CBRN unit leader determines the general location of the DTD within the decontamination
site and provides technical advice on setting up, operating, and closing the DTD area. The
supervisor of the DTD must establish a work/rest cycle. There are eight stations for a DTD.
Spacing between the stations is approximately 5 meters (see Figure V-2, page V-8). A
summary of personnel and equipment for a DTD is provided in Table V-3, page V-8.
Whenever possible, personnel should process through the DTD in buddy teams. If a buddy
is not available, the station attendant will provide assistance.

* Denotes the equipment needed for radiological contamination.
NOTE: Assume that an operational decontamination was done before the thorough decontamination.

          (1) Station 1—Individual-Gear Decontamination. At this station,
contamination is removed from individual gear (load-bearing equipment, mask carrier,
helmet, and weapon). The individual gear is checked with the ICAM or M256 kit to ensure
the completeness of the decontamination.
                (a) Preparation. At this station, the following equipment and supplies are
needed: four 30-gallon containers for each two decontamination lanes used; two
long-handled brushes for each two decontamination lanes used; sufficient STB slurry mix
for chemical contamination; hot, soapy water and a sponge for radiological contamination;
rinse water; two ponchos or plastic sheets; and engineer tape.
                 •    Dig a sump that is 6 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 4 feet deep (minimum).
Place four 30-gallon containers near the sump for easy changing. Fill two containers with
the STB slurry mix. Fill the other two containers with clean water for rinsing, and place
them about 3 feet forward of the STB containers. Place two long-handled scrub brushes at
each container of STB slurry.
                •    Prepare the slurry. Mix 100 pounds of STB with 20 gallons of hot
water. (The decontamination unit provides the hot water.) Change the mixture after 20
personnel have decontaminated their gear, and change the rinse water after every 10
personnel or when it appears dirty. Dump the old rinse water and used STB in the sump.

                 •    Place a poncho or a plastic sheet on the ground at the checkpoint.
Using engineer tape, divide the poncho or sheet in half (this is the contamination control
line). Ensure that the checkpoint is a minimum of 10 feet from the other stations in order
to get a true reading on the detection equipment. Place the following equipment at the
checkpoint for an average company-size unit: one ICAM, eight books of M8 detector paper,
four M256A1 detector kits, 100 plastic trash bags, and one AN/VDR-2 for radiological
contamination. An additional CAM/ICAM may be required in the event of saturation of the
ion chamber.
                (b) Execution. The contaminated person decontaminates his gear by
washing and scrubbing it for 6 minutes in the container with hot, soapy water or an STB
slurry mix (see Figure V-3). If he is wearing the M42 mask, he should use hot, soapy water
and a sponge or an STB slurry mix to decontaminate the hose and canister.




                     Figure V-3. Decontaminating Individual Equipment
                  •    The contaminated person dips his gear into the clean-water container,
rinses it for 4 minutes, hands it to the attendant, and then proceeds to the next station.
The attendant takes the gear to the equipment checkpoint, places the decontaminated gear
on the “dirty” side of the contamination control line, and returns to the container to pick up
more gear. The monitor at the checkpoint checks the gear using the appropriate detection
device and the procedures associated with that device. If residual contamination is
detected, the attendant recycles the gear and decontaminates it again. If the gear passes
the check, the attendant places it on the clean side of the contamination control line. The
attendant carries the equipment to the reissue point.
                •    The contaminated gear may go through more extensive washing and
checking procedures if time allows. The longer the gear is washed or left out in the air after
washing, the lower the contamination level will be. The gear may be put in closed areas or

plastic bags and checked for hazardous vapors with the M256A1 detector kit or the CAM.
The CAM only detects the G- and V-series nerve-agent vapors and the H-series blister-
agent vapors.
                 (c) Risk. If these procedures are done improperly, contamination may
remain on the equipment. The resulting vapor hazard could cause casualties to unmasked
personnel, particularly in closed areas (vehicle interiors) or heavily wooded areas where air
circulation is poor.
           (2) Station 2—Overboots and Hood Decontamination. At this station, gross
contamination on overboots, trouser legs, mask, and hood is neutralized. If ample hoods
are available at the reissue point, the hood should be cut away.
                (a) Preparation. The following equipment and supplies are needed for the
mask and the shuffle pit: one cutting tool for each decontamination lane used, one SDK or
IEDK per person, plastic trash bags (as required), ten drums of STB, and one shovel. One
person is required to operate this station. The attendant directs and observes the
contaminated personnel as they decontaminate their overboots and hoods.
                •    Prepare a shuffle pit by digging a shallow pit about 3 feet long, 3 feet
wide, and 6 inches deep.
                 •     Fill the shuffle pit with STB dry mix or STB slurry, depending on the
availability of water.
                •    Prepare the STB dry mix by mixing three parts of earth to two parts of
STB.
                •    Prepare the STB slurry as at Station 1.
                •    Add more STB to the mix after ten people have processed through the
shuffle pit. The CBRN unit will provide ten drums of STB for every company-size unit that
goes through the station.
                (b) Execution. The contaminated person walks into the shuffle pit,
spreads his legs apart (double shoulder-width), bends at the waist, and uses his hands to
thoroughly rub the STB dry mix or the STB slurry on his overboots and lower trouser legs
(see Figure V-4, page V-12). He takes special care to rub the rear of his overboots and also
removes any excess decontaminant from his gloves.

                          Figure V-4. Shuffle Pit Decontamination
                 •     If a replacement hood is available, remove the hood as follows: Buddy
1 cuts the shoulder straps and draw cord on Buddy 2’s hood. Buddy 1 pulls Buddy 2’s hood
inside out over the front of the mask, being careful not to touch the exposed neck or head.
Buddy 1 gathers Buddy 2’s hood in one hand and, using a cutting tool, cuts away the hood
as close as possible to the eye lens outsert, voicemitter, and inlet valve covers. Make sure
that nothing is left dangling below the bottom of the mask.
                 •    If a replacement hood is not available, Buddy 1 decontaminates and
rolls Buddy 2’s hood in the same manner as for a MOPP gear exchange (see Chapter III).
When the task is completed, Buddy 1 and Buddy 2 reverse roles.
NOTE: Personnel should check their overboots, rubber gloves, and overgarment
for damage. Any rips, tears, or punctures in these items should be reported to the
monitor at Station 5. This allows the monitor to check personnel for
chemical-agent symptoms and check their clothing for possible contamination.
                •    Buddy 1 decontaminates his own gloves. He loosens Buddy 2’s
overgarment hood by unfastening the barrel lock. (NOTE: If there is difficulty
unfastening the barrel lock, loosen the draw cord.) He then loosens the draw cord
around the edge of the hood and unfastens the hook-and-pile fastener at the chin. Buddy 1
must take care to avoid touching Buddy 2’s skin and throat.
                 •    Buddy 1 removes Buddy 2’s overgarment hood by opening the front
closure flap and pulling the slide fastener from the chin down to the chest. Buddy 1
instructs Buddy 2 to turn around. Buddy 1 grasps the back of Buddy 2’s hood, rolls the
hood inside out (being careful not to contaminate the inner garment), and pulls the hood off.
                (c) Risk. If these procedures are done improperly, contamination can be
transferred from the hood to the combat boots, head, and neck.
          (3)   Station 3—Overgarment Removal.



V-12               FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60           4 April 2006
                (a) Preparation. At this station, the contaminated overgarments are
removed before the agent penetrates the overgarment material and touches the
undergarments or the skin. The following equipment and supplies are needed: two
30-gallon containers for each two decontamination lanes, 100 plastic trash bags (or about
one per person), and ten boxes of SDKs. One person is required to operate this station. He
directs and monitors personnel as they remove their overgarments in the same manner as a
MOPP gear exchange (see Chapter III).
                (b)   Execution.
NOTE: The attendant avoids touching the person’s skin or inner clothing. If
contact is made, decontaminate immediately and then proceed with the
overgarment removal.
                 •    The attendant assists the contaminated person in removing his
overgarment. The contaminated person locates his trouser suspender snap-couplers by
feeling for them on the outside of his jacket and releases them. The attendant cuts and
removes the M9 detector paper from around the person’s wrist. He unfastens the
hook-and-pile fastener over the jacket zipper, waist cord, and wrist straps on the jacket.
The attendant unfastens the front-closure flap on the front of the jacket and pulls the slide
fastener from the top of the chest down to the bottom of the jacket. He unfastens the
webbing-strip snaps at the bottom of the jacket and releases the coat retention cord. He
unfastens the back snaps and instructs the person to make a fist. Touching only the outside
surface of the jacket, the attendant loosens the bottom of the jacket by pulling the material
away from the body. He then pulls the jacket down and away from him (see Figure V-5).




                       Figure V-5. Removing the Overgarment Jacket
                •   The attendant instructs the person to turn around, extend his arms in
front of him, and make a fist to prevent the removal of his chemical protective gloves. The
attendant grasps the jacket near the shoulders and removes it by pulling it down and away
from the body.
NOTE: If there is difficulty removing the jacket in this manner, pull one arm out
at a time.
               •     The attendant cuts and removes the M9 detector paper from the
trousers. He unfastens the hook-and-pile fasteners and zippers on the cuffs of the trousers.
He also unfastens the front waist snaps and unzips the front zipper. He has the person lift

one leg and point that foot down and bend slightly at the knees for stability. The attendant
grasps the cuff of the elevated foot with a hand on each side and pulls the cuff in an
alternating, jerking motion until the person can step out of the trouser leg. The process is
repeated on the other leg.
NOTE: The attendant ensures that the person steps wide enough so that he will
not rub his clean leg against the contaminated boot and overgarment.
          (4) Station 4—Overboots and Gloves Removal. At this station, contaminated
overboots and gloves are removed to limit the spread of contamination. The overboots and
gloves may also be decontaminated for reissue.
                (a) Preparation. At this station, the following equipment and supplies are
needed for every two lanes used: engineer tape, two cutting tools, and 100 plastic trash bags
(or about one per person).
                •    If the overboots and gloves are not being decontaminated, two
30-gallon containers are needed.
                  •    If the overboots and gloves are being decontaminated, the following
items are needed: eight 30-gallon containers; two long-handled brushes; two ponchos or
large plastic sheets; one CAM; one AN/VDR-2 (for radiological contamination); four M256A1
detection kits; one immersion heater; 100 plastic trash bags; M8 detector paper, as
required; 10 percent STB/HTH solution; hot, soapy water; and cold rinse water.
                •   If replacement overboots and gloves are available, establish a liquid
contamination control line and set two 30-gallon containers 1 foot back from the line (see
Figure V-6). Personnel should support themselves using the containers and discard their
overgarments into the containers. An attendant directs and monitors the personnel as they
remove their overboots and gloves in the same manner as a MOPP gear exchange (see
Chapter III); however, the person steps over the control line instead of onto a jacket.

V-14               FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60           4 April 2006
                 •   If replacement overboots and gloves are not available, fill two
30-gallon containers with hot, soapy water; two 30-gallon containers with a 10 percent
STB/HTH solution, placing two scrub brushes near the containers; and then fill two
30-gallon containers with cold rinse water. One attendant supervises and assists the
personnel wearing the M42 mask. The other two attendants decontaminate the overboots
and the gloves; one processes the overboots, while the other processes the gloves.
NOTE: Replace the water in all the containers once 20 items have been processed.
When available, the decontamination platoon will assist with the water
requirements.
                 •   Use engineer tape to mark the liquid-contamination control line on the
ground. Place the cutting tools, two dirty containers, and plastic bags on the dirty side of
the liquid contamination control line. The liquid contamination control line separates the
dirty and clean areas. No liquid agent should be tracked on the ground beyond the liquid
contamination control line.
                  (b) Execution. The attendant unfastens or cuts the elastic closures on the
overboots. The contaminated person faces the liquid contamination control line and steps
back about 12 inches. The attendant steps on the back of the overboot and instructs him to
lift his heel and work his foot out of the overboot and step across the liquid contamination
control line (see Figure V-7). Repeat the process on the other foot. If this process cannot
remove the overboot, the attendant cuts it off and discards it in the designated container.
The person holds the fingertips of his gloves and partially slides his hands out. The
attendant removes the gloves. If the contaminated person is wearing the M42 protective
mask, the attendant from Station 6 carries the filter canister until it is removed. The
overboots and gloves are decontaminated using the following steps:




                       Figure V-7. Liquid Contamination Control Line
NOTES:
1. Check all items for holes, tears, and punctures; and discard any item with a
defect. Do not decontaminate any item that is unserviceable.
2. The attendant at Station 4 performs his duty from the dirty side of the liquid
contamination control line.
                 •    Step 1. Submerge the gloves and overboots in their respective
container of hot, soapy water. (Some of the contamination is removed during this step.)


4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            V-15
When the overboots and gloves are removed from the container, ensure that no water
remains inside them.
                  •    Step 2. Submerge the gloves and overboots in their respective
containers of STB/HTH solution. Thoroughly scrub the items until no visible
contamination remains. After scrubbing, submerge each item once more before
transferring it to the rinse container.
                 •   Step 3. Thoroughly rinse the scrubbed items, making sure that they
are rinsed inside and out.
                •    Step 4. Place the usable items on a poncho or a plastic sheet to air-dry
and weather.
                 •   Step 5. Place the usable items in a plastic trash bag along with an
M256A1 detector kit. If the detector kit shows that contamination remains, the attendants
can recycle the items or discard them. However, if the kit shows no contamination, the
items can be reused.
                (c) Risk. If the overboots are improperly removed, the combat boots may
become contaminated and contamination may be spread to the clean areas. If the gloves
are not properly removed, the undergarments and skin may become contaminated.
            (5) Station 5—Monitoring. At this station, contamination on personnel is
identified, spot decontamination is provided, and medical aid is provided, as required.
                (a) Preparation. The following equipment and supplies are needed for the
attendant and health care provider: first aid supplies, one CAM/ICAM, one AN/VDR-2 (for
radiological contamination), five books of M8 detector paper per 100 people, and one case of
SDKs. A health care provider should be present to treat any casualties suffering from
chemical-agent symptoms. If a health care provider is unavailable, a combat lifesaver
should be present.
                 (b) Execution. The attendant checks personnel for agent vapor
contamination using the CAM/ICAM (see Figure V-8). The attendant uses M8 paper to
detect liquid agents. Symptoms of agent poisoning are the most obvious indication of skin
contamination. At this station, the trauma specialist checks each person for symptoms of
agent poisoning and treats them, as required. Personnel should report damage to their
MOPP gear that was identified at Stations 2, 3, and 4. The attendant can then
decontaminate the identified areas with the SDK. Personnel are remonitored after
decontamination. It is possible that all liquid chemical contamination is absorbed into the
clothing. If so, M8/M9 detector paper will indicate negative, even though there is a hazard.




V-16                FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
                          Figure V-8. Checking for Contamination
                 (c) Risk. If this station is omitted, the contaminated personnel could
become a casualty. After this station, the personnel will not be checked for contamination
or decontaminated again. Commanders can choose to conduct a more extensive
contamination check here if medical assistance and time are available. This decreases the
risk of casualties.
          (6) Station 6—Mask Removal. At this station, the mask is removed without
contaminating the person. The mask is taken to a mask decontamination point, limiting
agent transfer at the station.
                (a) Preparation. The M8A1 or M22 automatic chemical-agent detector
alarm (ACADA) and engineer tape are needed. Two people are needed to operate this
station. They remove and carry the masks to Station 7.
                (b)   Execution.
                  •   If the hood is still attached to the mask, the attendant pulls the hood
over the front of the mask, grabs the mask by the voicemitter cover, and pulls the mask off
the person. The person holds his breath as the mask is removed. If the mask has optical
inserts, the attendant holds the mask open so that the person can remove the inserts
without touching the outside of the mask. The person walks upwind 5 meters, crosses the
vapor contamination control line, and then resumes breathing. The attendant brings the
mask to Station 7.
NOTE: The attendant should show the individual the exit route before he
removes his mask and closes his eyes.
                 •    If the wind direction remains constant, no chemical vapor hazard is
expected beyond the vapor contamination control line. Position the M8A1 or the M22
ACADA upwind of the station to warn of vapor hazards. The person getting
decontaminated moves straight ahead; while his mask, which may still give off vapors, is
held on the dirty side of the vapor contamination control line and taken to Station 7 where
it is decontaminated.
                 (c) Risk. If the mask is removed improperly, the person can breathe toxic
vapors. There is a high probability that the vapor hazard is still present on the mask and
the hood after it is decontaminated. The person must not touch the outside of the mask
because it could contaminate his bare hands. (The person then proceeds to Station 8.)

         (7) Station 7—Mask Decontamination Point. At this station, all the
contamination is removed from the mask.
NOTE: Once 20 items have been processed in the wash containers, replace the
water. Once 10 items have been processed in the rinse water, replace it. Place
the contaminated waste into the sump.
                (a)    Preparation.
                 •   At this station, the following materials and equipment are needed:
four containers (about a 3-gallon capacity); one CAM (for chemical only); hot, soapy water;
rinse water; mask-sanitizing solution; one immersion heater; one 30-gallon container; two
sponges; and one case of paper towels per company.
                  •   Dig a sump that is 4 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4 feet deep to discard
the used filters and canisters. Place the equipment and materials as shown in Figure V-3,
page V-8. Three people are needed to operate this station. Two people strip, wash, rinse,
sanitize, and dry the masks. The other person checks the masks and carries them to the
reissue point.
                 (b) Execution. Remove the eye lens outserts and the hood (if the hood
was not cut off at Station 2). Remove and discard the filters or canisters. Put the items
into the properly marked containers. Wash the mask, hood, eye lens outserts, and hoses on
the M42 and M43 masks in hot, soapy water. Rinse these items in clean water, dip them
into the sanitizing solution, agitate them for 5 minutes, and then rinse them again in clean
water. Ensure that two different buckets of water are used for rinsing. Add one tube of
mask-sanitizing solution (HTH) for each quart of water. Wipe the masks with rags until
they are almost dry. Discard each container of mask-sanitizing solution into a sump after
every ten masks. Check the masks for contamination with a CAM. If the masks are still
contaminated, recycle them for more decontamination and then decontaminate your rubber
gloves. If the masks are not contaminated, take the masks to the reissue point. Take care
not to become contaminated or to contaminate the reissue point.
                 (c) Risk. If these procedures are done improperly, personnel may become
contaminated when the masks are reissued at the reissue point. Even if they are done
correctly, there is still a possible danger when many masks are stacked together. Small
amounts of residual vapor from each mask can become potentially dangerous.
NOTE: Runners between Stations 7 and 8 are in MOPP2 and are prepared to go to
MOPP4.
           (8) Station 8—Reissue Point. At this station, the mask and its components are
provided to personnel for reassembly and decontaminated individual equipment from
Station 1 is reissued.
               (a) Preparation. At this station, the protective mask prescribed load list
parts are needed. The unit CBRN NCO or supply sergeant sets up the reissue point to
provide personnel with replacement parts for all types of protective masks and to assist in
mask maintenance. If M42 or M43 masks are used, the unit CBRN NCO must be at this
station.
               (b) Execution. The mask and its components are reissued to the person
who assembles it in the AA. The unit CBRN NCO affixes canisters to the cleaned M42 and




V-18                  FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         4 April 2006
M43 hoses. The person picks up their individual gear and moves to the
postdecontamination AA.
               (c) Risk. If these procedures are done improperly, personnel may be
inadequately equipped for future operations.
NOTE: If time is critical, the CBRN NCO will have replacement chemical suits,
overboots, and gloves at this station for reissue. If time is available, personnel
will receive this equipment at the postdecontamination AA.
     d.    Resupply Support Responsibilities. The supporting decontamination unit must
supply most of the equipment and supplies that are required to operate the DTD. This does
not relieve the supported unit of the requirement to maintain adequate supplies to conduct
DTD procedures.
           (1) A decontamination unit will continue to receive support from its parent
organization. The supported unit provides the decontamination unit with replacements,
supplies, and material at the end of the DED. This shortens the time that the
decontamination unit is not mission-capable following the DED. The supported unit must
coordinate for supplies and equipment necessary to operate the DTD. Three people are at
the station for proper operation.
          •    One person supervises the decontamination of the individual gear and
takes the decontaminated equipment to the checkpoint. He also prepares a new slurry
mixture as necessary.
           •   One person remains at the checkpoint and checks the gear using the
detection equipment to ensure that it is decontaminated.
           •    One person transports the decontaminated gear to the reissue point.
            (2) Typical nondecontamination units do not have more than two CAMs per
company-size unit. However, the DTD requires a minimum of three CAMs. The supporting
HQ may need to provide additional CAMs. The division support command (DISCOM)
sustains the division decontamination units. A decontamination unit attached to a
maneuver force identifies the resources that are needed to accomplish the mission and
passes these requirements to the maneuver staff supply officer (S-4)/component logistics
staff officer (G-4). The S-4 and G-4 then coordinate with the supporting CSS element to fill
the requirement. The supply units that operate the Class II points issue the protective
masks and overgarments. They normally package protective clothing as complete sets of
MOPP equipment to support a predetermined number of personnel. Decontamination
supplies may be issued in preconfigured “push” packages.
      e.   DED. Decontamination units are responsible for setting up, operating, and
closing the DED portion of the thorough decontamination operation. The DED for CB
contamination is comprised of five stations. For radiological contamination, the DED uses
all but Station 2. Stations are normally 50 meters apart; however, spacing is METT-TC­
dependent. Resupply procedures are of critical importance. Resupply vehicles typically
operate independently and need to maintain communications with the platoon HQ in the
event that the platoon relocates or needs to change linkup locations or the mission
requirements change.

                                        CAUTION
                     Do not kneel or touch the ground while attempting
                     to remove contamination.

       (1)    Station 1—Primary Wash.

                 (a) At this station, the gross contamination and dirt are removed from the
vehicle. Spray the vehicle for 2 to 3 minutes with hot, soapy water, and scrub it to help
remove caked-on dirt. The mechanical action of scrubbing also helps remove thickened
chemical agents. Although the undersurfaces are difficult to reach, try to remove as much
dirt as possible. After scrubbing the vehicle, spray it again for 2 to 3 minutes to remove
loosened dirt and contamination. This station uses about 250 gallons of water per vehicle.
Larger vehicles with large quantities of dirt use more water. The runoff from this station is
contaminated and must be treated as hazardous. The contaminated runoff must be
controlled; if available, engineer support may be used to construct a sump. This station
requires high water pressure systems (M12A1 power-driven decontamination apparatus
[PDDA], M17 lightweight decontamination system [LDS], or multipurpose decontamination
system [MPDS]) rather than low water volume systems (65-gallon-per-minute [GPM]
pumps).
NOTE: Use 35 cubic feet of space per 250 gallons of liquid runoff when calculating
the size for the drainage sump.
                 (b) The effectiveness of the wash depends on the type of wash (hot, soapy
water; hot water; cold water; or steam). The relative effectiveness rankings for selected
surfaces are listed in Table V-4. Hot, soapy water is heated from about 120°F to 140°F to
and a detergent is added to reduce surface tension. The detergent removes the agent by
emulsification, which is followed by the mechanical displacement of the suspension. Hot
water alone is less effective than hot, soapy water. For some chemical agents, cold water
exhibits better solvent characteristics. Because of the high temperature, some agents are
best removed by steam through vaporization. See Potential Military Chemical/Biological
Agents and Compounds, for the chemical and physical properties of CW agents.

           (2)   Station 2—Decontaminant Application.
                  (a) At this station, a decontaminant is applied to the entire vehicle. The
vehicle is divided into four parts, and a member of the scrubbing team is assigned to each
part. This limits the workload of each member of the scrubbing team and avoids
duplication of work. STB slurry, STB dry mix (if the temperature is below 0°F), or another
approved decontaminant is applied starting at the top of the vehicle and working toward
the undercarriage. Every effort is made to apply the decontaminant to the undercarriage,
especially if the vehicle has crossed a contaminated area.
                 (b) Before starting the decontamination operation, the decontamination
crew prepares the slurry mix in the M12 PDDA or by mixing 100 pounds of STB with 20
gallons of hot water in 30-gallon containers. Each member of the scrubbing team wears a
toxicological agent-protective (TAP) apron or wet-weather gear to protect him and his
clothing from being saturated with water, decontaminant, or agent.
NOTE: Use 35 cubic feet of space per 250 gallons of liquid runoff when calculating
the size for the drainage sump.
              (c) Ensure that there is a sufficient amount of decontaminant on the item
being decontaminated for neutralization to occur.
           (3)   Station 3—Contact Time/Interior Decontamination.
                (a) At this station, the decontaminant is allowed to completely neutralize
the chemical agent and the interior of the vehicle is decontaminated. Vehicles are moved to
a concealed position. The attendant tracks the time each vehicle enters and exits this site
to ensure that at least 30 minutes has passed. When there is a 30-minute contact time,
there should be no desorption for most chemical agents. The attendant also tracks whether
any contamination is found on the inside of the vehicle. This information may be needed
for redeployment as part of the clearance decontamination.
                  (b) While the vehicle is held at this station for the decontaminant to
completely react, the driver inspects the interior of the vehicle for liquid contamination.
The driver is given M8 detector paper to check for chemical contamination. If he identifies
contamination, he is given decontamination supplies to decontaminate the interior of the
vehicle. The best decontamination solution for use in the interior of vehicles is a 5 percent
solution of HTH or STB. The driver wipes all reasonably accessible surfaces with a rag or
sponge soaked in the HTH or STB solution. He should not attempt to decontaminate areas
where there is little likelihood of contamination (electrical assemblies, the area beneath the
turret floor, etc.).
                (c) Once the interior decontamination is complete, the driver places
covers over the seats and floor of the vehicle. (This prevents the assistant driver from
soaking excess decontaminant into his MOPP gear.) The driver dismounts the vehicle and
proceeds to the start of the DTD. The assistant driver, having completed the DTD, checks
with the attendant to ensure that at least 30 minutes have passed, mounts the vehicle, and
moves it to the next station. All drivers must exercise caution when entering or exiting the
vehicle.
                 (d) For radiological contamination, use an AN/PDR-77 or AN/VDR-2
radiac detector to determine the extent and location of contamination inside the vehicle. If
there is contamination, determine the intensity of the contamination. If the contamination



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             V-21
is greater than 0.33 centigray (cGy), the interior of the vehicle must be decontaminated.
Use a wet sponge to wipe the interior of the vehicle.
           (4) Station 4—Rinse. At this station, the decontaminant is removed from the
vehicle. Spray the vehicle with water from the top to the bottom. Take care to rinse the
undercarriage. This station uses about 200 gallons of water per vehicle. Failure to remove
all the decontaminant from the vehicle may cause a false positive reading at Station 5. If
high water pressure systems (M12A1 PDDA, M17 LDS, or MPDS) are not available,
large-volume water pumps (65- and 125-GPM) should be used at this station. The driver
removes plastic or other material (if present) covering the seats and floor and disposes of it
as hazardous waste.
           (5) Station 5—Check. At this station, the vehicle is checked to see if it has a
negligible contamination level or if it still has significant contamination remaining.
Detection procedures will vary depending on the type of contamination. If significant
contamination is found on the vehicle, the vehicle is recycled to Station 2 for chemical
contamination or to Station 1 for radiological contamination. (See Figure V-1, page V-5, for
a suggested layout of the recycle route.) Caution must be exercised to prevent the vehicle
from contaminating clean areas. If the vehicle cannot be recycled, the commander must
decide what to do with the vehicle; at a minimum it should be segregated from the clean
troops and vehicles for weathering to occur. Personnel operating the vehicle must remain
in elevated MOPP. If sufficient resources and time are available, the vehicle should be
placed back into a through decontamination line.
                (a)    Chemical (CAM Interferents).
                  •    The ICAM/CAM is used to check for the presence of vapor from
residual liquid contamination. A one-bar or lower reading on the ICAM/CAM indicates a
negligible contamination level. Once the ICAM/CAM indicates the presence of vapor
contamination, M8 detector paper is used to verify the presence of liquid contamination. If
it is suspected that the ICAM/CAM and M8 detector paper are producing false positive
results, use an M256A1 detector kit near the area to verify the presence of contamination.
See Table V-5 for a list of common interferents that can cause false positive readings on the
CAM. If the vehicle has significant contamination remaining, recycle it to Station 2 for
chemical contamination or to Station 1 for radiological contamination. The commander
may modify the recycle criteria based on mission requirements.

                •     There will be desorption of chemical agents from the surfaces after
decontamination. The desorption of vapors on surfaces painted with the CARC will stop
sooner than it will on surfaces painted with alkyd. Consider this when checking
decontaminated items for overall decontamination effectiveness.
                 (b) Radiological. Use the AN/PDR-77, ADM-300, or AN/VDR-2 to
determine if any contamination remains. If there is contamination remaining, determine
the intensity of the contamination inside and outside the vehicle. If the contamination is
greater than 0.33 centigray per hour (cGy/hr), the vehicle is then recycled to Station 1.
     f.    Recycle Criteria. The commander, with the CBRN unit leader’s help, establishes
the recycle criteria before starting the decontamination operations. The recycle criteria
determine which vehicles will return to Station 1 after contamination is detected. If the
unit has sufficient time and resources, any vehicle having more contamination than the
acceptable level should be recycled. However, time and resources are usually limited and
not all vehicles can be recycled. The recycle criteria are based on the weathering effects.
      g.    Reconstitution Criteria. The operational and thorough decontamination
operations that are performed on vehicles or major equipment will be recorded on the
Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report (General-Purpose Vehicles). This
information will become a permanent record for these vehicles or major equipment. The
entries that are required on this form are the type of decontamination performed,
decontaminant used, date-time group (DTG) completed, location of the decontamination
site, and type of monitoring equipment used to verify decontamination completeness. This
information will assist with reconstitution operations once the conflict or war has ended.
     h.    DED Layouts.
           (1) Decontamination units establish thorough decontamination sites differently
because of organization and equipment differences. The optimum layout for each type unit
is described in the following paragraphs. This layout provides the maximum output for
units at 100 percent personnel and equipment strength. The equipment and personnel
requirements for the optimum layout are identified for the decontamination unit and the
supported unit (augmenter) (see Table V-6, page V-24).

           (2) Since it is unlikely that all units will be at 100 percent strength, alternate
layouts are discussed. For each alternate layout, decontamination unit equipment
requirements are identified. However, personnel requirements are not identified by the



V-24                     FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             4 April 2006
chemical unit and supported unit. The total number of personnel that are needed is
identified, with a minimum number of decontamination unit personnel.
     i.   Alternate-Layout Planning Considerations. CBRN unit leaders use METT-TC to
determine the best possible DED layout to execute their mission. When determining
alternate DED layouts, they use the following guidelines:
          (1) The ability to spray hot, soapy water or steam under pressure must be
retained at Station 1.
            (2)   The largest number of people is required at Station 2.
            (3)   Experienced and qualified ICAM/CAM operators are required at Station 5.
          (4) Water does not have to be hot to rinse off the decontaminant; however, the
lower the water pressure, the greater the amount of water required for the rinse.
     j.     Decontamination Unit (M12A1).
           (1) The optimum DED layout for an M12A1 PDDA-equipped decontamination
unit requires the use of all authorized equipment and personnel. While this DED layout is
manpower- and equipment-intensive, it provides for the rapid decontamination of vehicles
and equipment (eight vehicles processed per hour). This layout uses dual lanes at Stations
1, 4, and 5 to process two vehicles at a time. Since the most time- and labor-intensive work
takes place at Station 3, this station is designed to process three vehicles at a time.
           (2) It may not be possible for an M12A1 PDDA-equipped decontamination unit
to use the optimum DED layout. Limited personnel or equipment will affect the DED
layout. See Table V-7 for an alternate layout. The processing rate using this layout will be
affected by work/rest cycles (see Table V-8, page V-26).

NOTE: When operating in temperatures above 75°F, consider the ability of the personnel to accomplish the
mission. Once the personnel have reached their maximum workload for heat stress, they cannot recover
quickly enough to accomplish the decontamination mission. A viable option is to postpone the
decontamination operation until a cooler part of the day or evening. This will reduce the heat stress load on
the personnel and increase the probability of mission success.

     k.      Decontamination Platoon (M17 LDS or MPDS).
           (1) The decontamination units equipped with the M17 LDS or MPDS will set
up the DED differently than the decontamination units equipped with the M12A1 PDDA
(see Table V-9). While the optimum DED layout is manpower- and equipment-intensive, it
provides for the rapid decontamination of vehicles and equipment (eight vehicles processed
per hour). The layout uses dual lanes at Stations 1, 4, and 5 to process two vehicles at a
time. Since the most time- and labor-intensive work takes place at Station 3, this station is
designed to process three vehicles at a time. The processing rate of this layout will be
affected by any work/rest cycles.

*Denotes personnel from the decontamination unit.

      l.    Thorough Decontamination Site Closure. Once all vehicles and personnel from
the contaminated unit have processed through the thorough decontamination site, the site
can be closed. Coordination with the supported unit is necessary before actually closing the
site to ensure that all contaminated elements have been processed. The decontamination
unit closes the DED first. Once the DED is closed, the decontamination unit processes
through the DTD. After the chemical unit has processed through the DTD, the DTD is
closed. At this point, the decontamination unit marks the area as a contaminated area and
reports its exact location to the supported unit using an NBC5 Report.
           (1) Closing the DED Area. The DED is closed in sequence, starting at
Station 1. All vehicles, equipment, and nonexpendable supplies are inspected for
contamination. If contamination is found on an item, it is decontaminated.
                (a) Station 1—Primary Wash. Spray all vehicles and equipment with hot,
soapy water to remove any contamination that could have been transferred during the
primary wash operations. Drain the water billets or fabric tanks of water. Inspect all
equipment and vehicles for contamination using the appropriate detection equipment.
                (b) Station 2—Decontaminant Application. Throw the mops and brushes
that were used in applying the decontaminant into a sump or bury them. Inspect the
unused decontaminant, and load it on a vehicle.
               (c) Station 3—Contact Time/Interior Decontamination. Inspect any
unused supplies and equipment for contamination. If no contamination is detected, load
the equipment and supplies on a vehicle. Throw all contaminated supplies into the nearest
sump.
                 (d) Station 4—Rinse. Spray all vehicles and equipment with hot, soapy
water to remove any contamination that could have been transferred during the rinse
operations. Drain the water billets or fabric tanks. Inspect all the equipment and vehicles
for contamination using the appropriate detection equipment. If no contamination is
detected, load the equipment onto the vehicles. Spread one can of STB dry mix into each of
the sumps and then cover them. Post NBC hazard markers near the covered sumps.
               (e) Station 5—Check. Ensure that all equipment has been checked for
contamination. If it is not contaminated, load it onto a vehicle. If it is contaminated,
decontaminate it according to the appropriate technical manual (TM). Throw any
contaminated supplies into the nearest sump. Move all vehicles upwind of Station 5 and
inspect them again for contamination. If any contamination is detected, use the M100 to

decontaminate the identified areas. Once the vehicles are staged, all personnel proceed to
the DTD.
          (2) Closing the DTD Area. Once all personnel from the DED have processed
through the DTD, it may be closed. After the last person has exited the DTD—
                (a) Pick up all used supplies from Station 7, and put them in the Station 7
sump. Remove the contamination control line. If engineer tape was used, dispose of it in
the Station 7 sump.
                (b) Move all usable supplies and equipment from all stations to Station 1.
Discard all unusable supplies from Stations 3, 4, and 5 in the Station 1 sump.
               (c) Decontaminate all supplies and equipment collected at Station 1 using
the decontamination and rinse water at Station 1. Pour the decontamination and rinse
water from the station into the sump, and decontaminate the containers.
              (d) Mark the entire decontamination area. Remove your overgarment
using the MOPP gear exchange technique, and dispose of it in the sump at Station 1.
                (e) Move any equipment used to fill the sump upwind of the
decontamination area. Decontaminate rubber gloves, and move all remaining equipment
and supplies at Station 1 upwind of the decontamination area. Keep this equipment and
supplies separate from that used to fill the sump.
NOTE: See Appendix K for detailed procedures on the disposal of contaminated
waste.
8.     Thorough Decontamination Under Unusual Conditions
     Decontamination operations are not restricted to daylight hours. The enemy may
employ CBRN weapons at night, since weather conditions are usually more favorable for
their employment. Consequently, CBRN contamination encountered at night may require
decontamination before daylight.
     a.   Conducting decontamination operations at night is a challenge. “White light”
cannot be used without possibly revealing your location. However, decontamination
personnel must have illumination to perform essential decontamination tasks such as
spraying water, applying decontaminants, using detection equipment, and doffing the
MOPP gear.
      b.   Use M8/M9 detector paper to check for chemical contamination and to see how
well the chemical decontamination was performed. If contamination is present, the paper
color changes to red, which cannot be seen if red-filtered light is used. The CAM and
M256A1 detector kit can be used to identify and detect chemical agents, but they require a
light source to obtain a reading.
     c.    Several vehicles waiting for or undergoing decontamination present a significant
infrared signature because of the hot engines. Entering, exiting, and moving within the
decontamination site is difficult under blackout conditions.
     d.    Night-decontamination operations are difficult, but they can be accomplished.
Conduct thorough decontamination operations in built-up areas, whenever possible. Use a
building for DTD operations and a warehouse for DED operations, if available. This allows
the use of white light. Personnel can see what they are decontaminating, see where they
are going, and read the color changes of the M8/M9 detector paper.

     e.    There will be a need for additional people to act as ground guides in the DED
area. The NCOICs of Stations 1, 2, and 4 will inspect each vehicle with a flashlight or
chemical light before the vehicle can proceed to the next station. There should be at least
two flashlights at each station in the DED and DTD areas.
9.   Colocation of Patient Decontamination With Troop Decontamination
     The decontamination of patients for entry into an MTF or while they are awaiting
evacuation in clean vehicles for transport to an MTF can be established adjacent to a DTD
area. Close coordination needs to be maintained between medical personnel supervising
the patient decontamination and personnel supervising the DTD. This offers benefits to
both units.
NOTE: See Chapter X and FM 4-02.7 for more information.

                       CLEARANCE DECONTAMINATION 


1.   Background
     a.    Clearance decontamination is the final level of decontamination. It is the most
resource-intensive. It requires command involvement, guidance, and decisions on the
disposition of possible mission-essential equipment.
     b.    Clearance decontamination provides the decontamination of equipment and
personnel to a level that allows unrestricted transportation, maintenance, employment and
disposal. Clearance decontamination can be used to prepare organizations or individual
units for return to their home garrisons, whether within the United States, its territories,
or possessions. At the end of a conflict or at normal rotation during peacekeeping or nation-
building operations, a unit may be ordered to return to garrison. US military assets may
also be required to support clearance decontamination to support HLS/HLD requirements.
     c.    Tasks given to CBRN defense personnel or elements supporting clearance
decontamination may involve the physical status of the unit or activity itself, or they may
involve the fulfillment of obligations under a treaty or memorandum of understanding
(MOU) to the HN. These tasks may include the following:
     •     Recordkeeping.
     •     Postconflict intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB).
     •     FP.
     •     Decontamination.
     •     Containment of residual hazards.
     •     Recovery and control of enemy CBRN capabilities.
     •     FHP.
     •     Coordination with multinational forces or nonmilitary entities.
     •     Contaminated material retrogradation.
      c.    Most of the specified and implied tasks of CBRN defense personnel supporting
clearance decontamination are simultaneous and interdependent. For example, post
conflict IPB supports FP, containment of residual hazards, and contaminated material
retrogradation. Clearance decontamination may include supporting recovery and control of
the enemy CBRN hazards (see Figure VI-1, page VI-2). Recordkeeping supports virtually
all other tasks. Recovery operations are closely related to conflict termination.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            VI-1
                           Figure VI-1. Decontamination Support
     e.    Clearance decontamination requires a significant level of effort. The resources
needed to conduct clearance decontamination (i.e., low-level CBRN or TIM monitoring
capabilities, decontamination units, MEDSURV, supplies, and equipment) require
coordination from the unit level through the combatant command level.
2.     Postconflict Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace
     As a conflict ends, there remain significant IPB-related functions that may continue to
require decontamination support.
      a.   Even when the conflict has terminated, the continued presence of threat CBRN
weapons, contaminated areas, and TIM hazards presents volatile situations. This may be
particularly true as HN and international relief agencies enter the area. CBRN defense
assets may be tasked to support intelligence collection on enemy CBRN weapons that are
assessed to exist but which have not been captured or destroyed. In such cases, intelligence
will attempt to develop a complete picture of the enemy’s residual CBRN assets and
capabilities—including probable locations and dispositions of weapons and agents, research
and production facilities, documentation, key enemy military and civilian personnel, and
possible reaction from residual enemy forces.
     b.    The CBRN defense personnel may also be tasked to assess the hazards from
indigenous TIM facilities that have suffered collateral damage and to be prepared to deal
with the release of TIM from those facilities.

3.   Force Protection
      During conflict termination, FP measures still deter, detect, contain, and mitigate the
possible effects of CBRN attacks and threats. Unit draw-down may invite strikes by
residual enemy forces or terrorists to punish and inflict revenge on the United States and
coalition forces. Planning for decontamination operations, therefore, must continue.
Decontamination site selection can now be based on internal lines of communication (LOCs)
rather than the axis of advance, which facilitates logistics and transportation. Other site
selection considerations (such as road network accessibility, water sources and drainage,
and likely wind direction) still apply.
4.   Decontamination
     Clearance decontamination may be required as part of a supported unit’s restoration
operations. For example, a unit may now have time to conduct clearance decontamination
that was deferred during previous operations. Decontamination elements may also be
tasked to support the decontamination of civilian personnel, equipment, facilities or terrain
in coordination with HN authorities. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
for NBC Defense of Theater Fixed Sites, Ports, and Airfields for more information on
clearance decontamination procedures.
5.   Containment of Residual Hazards
     Expect to receive taskings to identify, assess, and mitigate contamination hazards that
may remain at the end of the conflict. An assessment based on the accurate records of
known hazards will help determine what actions are necessary (e.g., isolation, weathering,
decontamination, containerization). Decontamination may be required, and
decontaminated materials may be transferred to the HN or to follow-on forces.
6. Recovery and Control of Enemy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear Capabilities
     Emphasis will be placed on identifying and securing enemy CBRN capabilities. As
enemy CBRN weapons, agents, and facilities are discovered, they will likely be disabled,
destroyed, or isolated. Decontamination elements can expect taskings to support the
recovery and control of enemy CBRN capabilities.
     a.    As in combat operations, prior planning will facilitate decontamination support
and ensure that the mission is successful. Decontamination elements should maintain
close coordination with those forces searching for and assessing residual enemy CBRN
capabilities (particularly the types of agents, locations, and size of facilities). This
coordination will enable decontamination planners to anticipate logistics, transportation,
and personnel requirements.
     b.    A search and recovery task force (S/RTF), formed to gain timely control over
enemy CBRN capabilities, may include a decontamination specialist to advise on how
items, facilities, or hazard areas may be decontaminated or advise on the practicality of
decontamination. This specialist would provide vital planning information to the
decontamination element.
     c.    The S/RTF would also provide emergency responses to CBRN incidents or
accidents, resulting in an emergency response from the supporting decontamination
element. This requires the decontamination element to maintain close coordination with its
higher HQ and supporting transportation and logistics elements.

7.     Force Health Protection
     a.     The services use MEDSURV systems to identify outbreaks of illness, which can
help in the assessment and identification of potential BW casualties. Medical teams can
identify, treat, and handle CBRN casualties. MTFs have personnel who are trained in
decontamination procedures so that only clean patients will enter and be admitted to
hospitals. Biologically contagious patients can be treated under isolation conditions. HSS
systems also conduct health risk assessments for CBRN and TIM exposure and monitor
individual exposure as part of their recordkeeping. For more information, see FM 4-02.7.
     b.    Records kept by decontamination elements also contribute to the surveillance
process. When coordinated with health service units is maintained, useful information on
individual exposure and decontamination (such as the type of agent, level of radiation
exposure, number of exposed individuals, dates and times of exposure events) can be
provided to assess the patient’s condition and short- and long-term treatment requirements.
8.     Coordination With Multinational Forces or Nonmilitary Entities
     a.     As combat operations terminate, multinational forces or HN elements may arrive
and assume missions from redeploying US units. The activities of these forces and
organizations may include the decontamination and management of contaminated areas.
The US decontamination elements may be tasked to take the lead or to assist in these
activities. Working relationships with these elements should be defined by a treaty or
MOU.
     b.   Incoming personnel must be briefed on multinational or HN procedures,
equipment, and training. In any case, ensure that the responsibilities of each element and
the procedures to be used are agreed to and clearly understood by all parties.
9.     Contaminated Materials Retrogradation
     As a part of unit redeployment, some equipment to be redeployed (retrograded) may
have potential residual or low-level contamination. Suspected equipment may be identified
through the records made during operational and thorough decontamination operations.
Also, any vehicle or piece of equipment that was present in an attack or a downwind hazard
area may have residual contamination.
     a.    If equipment is to be retrograded under nonemergency conditions, then it is
assumed that there will be time for thorough and clearance decontamination and
weathering. Redeployment planning should specify consolidation points in the JRA for
equipment suspected of residual contamination. Specialized detectors and monitors may be
needed for clearance decontamination to confirm and monitor for contamination. As
suspected equipment is consolidated for monitoring, decontamination, and weathering,
security and buffer zones around the site provide an additional contamination control
measure. Personnel engaged in monitoring, preparation, and clearance decontamination of
equipment will require stringent personal protection and specialized detectors. This
process may continue for weeks or months.
      b.  Even after thorough decontamination, potential vapor and contact hazards will
likely remain. The risk increases as contaminated equipment is consolidated and as
personnel work around the equipment for extended periods. The risk increases again as
equipment is disassembled for maintenance or containerization (therefore, the need for
clearance decontamination). However, given the limitations of decontamination technology,

some items of equipment may require extensive weathering before retrogradation, or may
have to be destroyed.
     c.   Once in the continental United States (CONUS), an item of equipment with a
contamination history will require precautionary measures throughout its remaining life
cycle. Guidance on the eventual disposition of previously contaminated equipment should
be provided from the strategic level.
     d.     Accurate record keeping is crucial to a successful clearance decontamination
operation. Messages sent or received via the NBCWRS; records of personnel and
equipment undergoing operational, thorough, and clearance decontamination; and
photographic or video records will be referred to again in assessing a unit’s requirements
during clearance decontamination operations and in evaluating the (former) battlespace for
residual CBRN and TIM hazards. Especially important are NBC 4, 5, and 6 reports, which
may also be used to report TIM hazards. There may be a requirement to share information
on contaminated areas (contained in NBC 4, 5, and 6 reports) with the HN. (The security
that surrounded an NBC5 report during operations may no longer be required when
hostilities have ceased.) These reports may also form the basis for new CBRN
reconnaissance and monitoring missions at the end of hostilities.
            (1) Records pertaining to personnel and equipment that have undergone
operational and thorough decontamination are also necessary for assessing the unit
undergoing clearance decontamination. These records are made at the predecontamination
triage (they identify elements that required decontamination and identify uncontaminated
elements that were sent ahead to the postdecontamination AA) and should contain vehicle
and equipment identification numbers. While the contaminated unit is responsible for
maintaining an accurate decontamination record, it is useful for the supporting
decontamination element to keep a duplicate record. For example, such records can be used
to justify the expenditure of decontamination materials and the reordering of supplies. In
the context of clearance decontamination operations, the decontamination element may be
required to account for decontaminated personnel and equipment, even those that belong to
a supported unit.
            (2) Prepare follow-up reports as the conflict nears an end. Prepare summaries
that outline when, where, and how CBRN attacks or TIM incidents occurred. These records
will facilitate many of the tasks associated with clearance decontamination operations,
particularly postconflict IPB and the containment of residual hazards. Site incident reports
involving personnel will be useful in evaluating long-term health issues that could be
operationally related and will contribute to overall FHP.

                                        Chapter VII 

         FIXED-SITE, PORT, AND AIRFIELD DECONTAMINATION 


1.   Background
      a.   This chapter addresses fixed-site decontamination, capabilities, and
organization. It also discusses the procedures for processing personnel on a fixed site for
chemical and radiological decontamination. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense of Fixed Sites, Ports,
and Airfields for more detailed information on CBRN decontamination operations for fixed
sites. Decontamination is necessary when protective items cannot be worn to perform the
mission, or when long-term occupancy is anticipated. Examples of fixed sites include the
following:
     •     Command, control, communications, and intelligence facilities.
     •     Ports and airfields.
     •     Temporary key structures for reserve and large troop concentration.
     •     Supply installations, and depots.
      •     Pre-positioning of material configured to unit sets (POMCUS) storage locations,
airfields, water terminals, and rail terminals.
     •     MTFs.
     •     Ammunition supply points and petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL) points.
     •     Maintenance sites.
     b.    Decontaminate as soon as possible. Remove any contamination that forces
personnel into a higher MOPP level. The first steps in recovering mission effectiveness are
personnel decontaminating themselves, their personal equipment, and critical, mission-
essential equipment.
      c.   Decontaminate only what is necessary. For fixed sites, decontamination is more
of a manpower resource constraint rather than a time constraint. Decontaminate only
mission-essential equipment, and mark contamination appropriately. An example of this
principle is the loading and unloading of supplies on a boxcar at a site with railheads.
Since fixed-site personnel do not have the capability to decontaminate the entire boxcar,
only those parts that are touched, such as the door, are decontaminated.
     d.    Decontaminate by priority. The commander must establish a set of priorities.
These priorities may be broken down by functional area if the site performs missions such
as maintenance (light and heavy), ammunition repair and supply, and general supply.
Items such as wheeled vehicles, forklifts, and railcars, which are critical to the overall
mission, should be decontaminated first.
     e.   Limit the spread of contamination. Units should conduct decontamination
(operational and thorough) outside the contaminated area but near where the
contamination occurred. This reduces the risk of spreading contamination to other areas
and reduces travel time.



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60           VII-1
2.      Assessing Capability
     Fixed-site decontamination capabilities must be adapted for each fixed site. Mobile
decontamination equipment capabilities may be available at a fixed site to decontaminate
equipment, roads, and buildings. Loading docks, entries and exits, and building exteriors
can be decontaminated with more conventional methods such as using STB and soap and
water. Equipment such as fire trucks could also be used. Commanders should identify all
systems that are capable of contributing to the decontamination effort (e.g., fire trucks,
steam cleaners, water pumps). Decontamination equipment can be retrofitted to
accommodate the throughput of each work area. For instance, rest-and-relief shelters need
rapid personnel decontamination systems, and supply operations need a decontamination
system that can handle moderate-size pieces of equipment at a high volume.
3.      Organizing for Decontamination
       The commander should designate and train teams that can perform decontamination
for fixed-site operations. The following are fixed-site decontamination techniques that the
teams could apply:
     a.    Decontamination can be conducted at contaminated entry and exit points to
sustain the mission. This concept is more practical and efficient when employing limited
decontaminated assets. The STB application could be conducted 3 meters on each side of
the entry and exit points. Transfer hazard will remain a problem until all parts of the area
have weathered. Buildings entries and exits must be decontaminated accordingly.
     b.    To decontaminate helipads and similar sites, spray STB on entry and exit
approaches or on paths in an event that chemical contamination occurs. Airborne STB
particles can damage sensitive aircraft components so the area should be washed with
water prior to landing helicopters.
     c.    In POMCUS sites, decontaminate entry and exit approaches to limit
contamination. Exposed vehicles in motor parks will get contaminated, but most likely
there will not be enough personnel to drive the vehicles to a decontamination station.
Decontaminate parked equipment by spraying them with STB or hot, soapy water. Driving
other vehicles around the parked vehicles and equipment will get the outside air flowing
and will accelerate the weathering process of the chemical agents.
      d.   Establish a patient transfer zone for medical assets where designated dirty
ambulances coming from the contaminated area can transfer patients to clean ambulances
for patient movement to the MTF.
4.      Buildings and Mission-Essential Operating Areas and Surfaces
     The decontamination of buildings and mission-essential surfaces and equipment
requires a well-thought-out process.
     a.     Buildings. The decontamination of a building consists of two parts—interior and
exterior.
           (1) Interior. When conducting decontamination of the interior of a building,
the following activities must occur:
            •    Secure the facility.
            •    Sample to confirm and determine the extent of the contamination.



VII-2                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60        4 April 2006
            •     Evaluate the sampling results.
            •     Isolate the areas to prevent the spread of the contamination.
           •    Remove critical objects for special decontamination procedures. Take care
to ensure that contamination is not spread or transferred during movement.
            •     Decontaminate localized areas of the contamination.
            •     Continue monitoring and protecting against low-level exposure risks.
            •     Document and record the decontamination operations.
           (2) Exterior. When decontaminating the exterior of a building, see Appendix D
to determine how to decontaminate specific building surfaces (e.g., roofing material and
wood). Many materials may absorb contamination and may not be completely
decontaminated. The removal or sealing (painting) of these surfaces may be required to
reduce the hazard. Continue monitoring the decontaminated surfaces until the detector
indicates there is no more off-gassing. As temperatures rise, off-gassing of previously
contaminated surfaces may occur at detectable levels. A point detection device (e.g.,
ICAM/CAM) should be used to monitor contaminated surfaces.
     b.     Mission-Essential Operating Surfaces and Equipment.
          (1) On- and Off-Loading Ramps and Piers. Use Appendix D to determine how
to decontaminate the surfaces of on- and off-loading ramps and piers.
            (2)   Helipads. Use Appendix D to determine how to decontaminate helipad
surfaces.
         (3) Lines of Communications. See Appendix I for information on terrain
decontamination.
            (4) Staging Areas. Staging areas pose a unique opportunity for the enemy to
contaminate large amounts of personnel and equipment. Commanders and their CBRN
staffs must ensure that they can effectively identify contaminated personnel and
equipment. Decontaminating only those personnel and equipment that have been
contaminated saves resources and time. The decontamination of staging areas can be
critical to operations. In addition to the personnel and equipment contaminated,
contaminated routes in and out of staging areas must be decontaminated to reduce the
likelihood of the spread of the contamination. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance for methods to determine the
location and extent of contamination.
            (5)   Terrain. Terrain decontamination is covered in Appendix I of this manual.
5.   Personnel Processing Procedures (Chemical)
      A comprehensive CBRN VA can help determine a suitable location for the fixed-site
contamination control area (CCA) and the toxic-free area (TFA) complexes. The next
consideration is determining how large an area will be needed. The CCA and TFA may be
off or on the installation. The location of the CCA and TFA will depend on feedback from
the CBRN VA.




4 April 2006              FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             VII-3
      a.   Off Site. The decision to site CCA and TFA complexes off the installation
(probably at preselected sites located at least 10 km from the installation) should work if
the following parameters are present:
          (1) The sites are located at least 15 km away from populated areas, and the
proposed routes to the CCA and TFA complexes are not intersected by potential civilian
evacuation routes.
           (2) Locations provide adequate space, multiple access routes, sufficient water
and utility support, communications (primarily back to the main installation C2 and
warning and notification networks), and a degree of personnel protection (from elements
and hostile attack).
          (3) Civilian populations are not located downwind within 15 km of the CCA
complex, to include the aeration area and contaminated-waste disposal area.
            (4) There is an exceptionally limited or nonexistent ground threat, to include
activities from terrorists.
          (5)   The installation possesses sufficient resources to execute the plan.
      b.   On Site. Finding and utilizing clean areas for CCA and TFA operations within
the installation perimeter is preferable when—
           (1) The installation is near heavily populated civilian areas or near a potential
civilian evacuation route (there may be resulting traffic jams that would probably result in
making off-base CCA and TFA complexes unreachable).
          (2)   A ground threat exists.
        (3) The population is resource-constrained in regards to transportation.
Communications limitations are also a factor.
         (4) The installation is large enough to possess areas outside the target-rich
environment associated with the industrial and main housing areas.
            (5) The installation possesses a reliable detection network. The potential risk
to personnel as a result of changing weather conditions and certain terrain features is
increased if the installation cannot field an effective detection system. For example,
because agents tend to follow the low-lying areas of the ground, an installation may
establish CCAs and TFAs on uncontaminated hilltops, ridges, or multistoried buildings. It
is possible that the concentrations of an agent at these levels (verified through the use of
detectors) are such that rest and relief may be obtained by “going up.”
    c.   Combined Approach. A combined approach of site selection may be the best
methodology. The prioritization for site selection should be—
          (1)   On site with a ground level arrangement.
          (2)   On site with a vertical arrangement (space permitting).
          (3)   Off site.
       d.   Space Requirement. The requirement for space is a factor associated with
selecting the site for CCA and TFA complexes. The minimum size for CCA and TFA sites is
500 square meters. Once a processing line is established and people are moving through it
(i.e., as one person leaves a station, another person steps up), a relatively smooth flow will



VII-4                FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
begin to take place. Each of the CCA and TFA complex subcomponents has accompanying
space requirements, and there are several variables.
            (1) CCA Entrance. A single entrance area can be used for multiple processing
lines. However, the size needed for the entrance area depends on the number of personnel
the installation is expecting to process at any given time. This number will also drive the
sizes of the transportation point, CCA, and holding area where personnel can rest while
waiting for their turn to process.
           (2) CCA Processing Lines. The CCA processing lines will take a large amount
of space in order to optimize processing and FP ideals. Spread out the distance between
processing stations as far as reasonably possible. If space permits, stations should be
spaced approximately 18 meters apart and areas within each station should be 9 meters
apart. Establish the lines in an angular, staggered fashion as opposed to a straight line.
The line angle should be 20°. When using this method, the concentration of trailing vapor
hazards washing over people downwind of each processing station is significantly reduced.
           (3) Mask Refurbishment Area. Lay the out-processing lines with plenty of
space for the mask refurbishment area located in the contact hazard area (CHA). The mask
refurbishment area requires sufficient space for working; a disposal area for detection kits,
decontamination kits, hoods, and eye lens outserts; a stock of spare parts; and a holding
area for masks waiting to be checked.
          (4) Ground Chemical Ensemble (GCE) Aeration and the Contaminated-Waste
Disposal Area. The aeration and disposal areas have the potential to be as large or larger
than the processing lines. Therefore, an area of approximately 200 square meters is
recommended. This area should be separate from the CCA lines and the TFA by
approximately 50 meters.
          (5) Buffer or Transition Area. Once monitored, personnel remove their masks
and proceed to the TFA. At least 25 meters is recommended from the end of the vapor
hazard area (VHA) to the TFA.
           (6) TFA. The size of the TFA is the largest variable of all. An area of 500
square meters is recommended. The main housing portion of the TFA should be separated
from the CCA processing lines by the maximum distance available. A separation of at least
100 meters is recommended. A chemical-vapor detection network should exist between the
TFA and the CCA. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear,
Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance for guidance on setting up a chemical detection
network.
      e.    Other CCA and TFA Consideration Factors. The selection process involves
numerous factors, to include the availability of areas that are upwind and a safe distance
from contamination, areas accessible by ground transportation, and areas offering as much
privacy and concealment as possible. Selecting locations that are out in the open may
invite secondary attacks and the unwanted curiosity of others. Additional considerations
include areas where localized weather conditions and wind patterns remain consistent,
areas away from valley and ridgelines, areas offering the most inherent necessities, and
areas within walking distance of the personnel shelter portion of the TFA. It will do no
good to decontaminate crew members if they cannot get to a clean area to rest and debrief.
If the shelter is not in the immediate area, arrange transportation.




4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            VII-5
          (1) The locations must also offer the best possible options for disposing of or
removing contaminated waste. Always coordinate the disposal of hazardous waste with
CBRN specialists.
            (2) For an airbase (AB), choosing a site near the ground personnel processing
line will facilitate resupply and provide better security. However, a potential secondary
hazard exists with this technique since ground crew personnel are more likely to encounter
contamination. However, the aircrew ensemble, by design, does not provide protection from
liquid contamination. They should not process through the ground crew CCA.
          (3) Multiple site locations should be chosen to ensure the coverage of threat
contingencies.
           (4) Other considerations during the site selection process are site security,
communications, the slope of the terrain, and the presence of other natural features. The
protection of equipment from temperature extremes, rain, and pilferage is also required.
            (5) For an AB, the decontamination site must be capable of accommodating the
appropriate aircraft type in the required numbers. It should be relatively secure but close
enough to refueling and rearming points to permit a reasonably quick turnaround if
required. The site should have sufficient terrain flight routes within 2 to 3 km to facilitate
entry and exit. A slight slope to the terrain is desirable but must remain within aircraft
limits. It is preferable to sequence groups of aircraft through the decontamination site to
prevent arriving or departing aircraft from interfering with decontamination operations.
Depending on the personnel and resources available, it may be possible to clean several
aircraft simultaneously.
     f.  CCA and TFA Patient Decontamination Sites. Optimal requirements for a
decontamination site include the following:
          (1) Colocation with the supported MTF (not closer than 75 meters downwind or
crosswind and situated so that arriving vehicles and casualties can reach it without
approaching the MTF).
            (2)   Access to water (free of CBRN contaminants but not necessarily potable).
            (3)   Hookup to electricity or an electric generator for water pump operation and
lighting.
          (4) Approximately a 60-meter controlled perimeter and ground or floor
gradient sufficient to facilitate the drainage of contaminated water away from the
decontamination facility and MTF.
NOTE: For detailed instructions on patient decontamination, see Chapter X and
FM 4-02.7. Patient spot decontamination can be performed at the CHA with
transport to an MTF that has a patient decontamination station (PDS).
     g.   Decontamination Site Layout. The CCA and TFA complexes are composed of
subelements; each is connected in some way and can only be successfully accomplished
through cohesive, integrated operations. See Figure VII-1 for an example of a
decontamination site layout.




VII-6                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         4 April 2006
                      Figure VII-1. Sample Decontamination Site Layout
          (1) The transportation drop-off point should be located on the downwind side of
the CCA (approximately 30 meters). Establish a wind device (i.e., windsock) to monitor the
wind direction. It is in this area that the first active efforts are taken by individuals to
reduce contact and vapor hazards. As personnel leave the transportation drop-off point,
they should be directed (by a sign or by an attendant) to the CCA.
          (2) The entrance to the CCA includes the following areas: arrival and initial
decontamination, weapons clearing, wash and holding, and external equipment removal.
Use this CCA entrance for the following:
                 (a) To perform the initial decontamination of each person and his buddy
prior to entering the CHA.
                (b)   To inform personnel of the sequence of events and emergency response
procedures.
                (c)   To provide a covered area for rest and relief while waiting to process.
               (d) To allow for the turn-in of weapons and the removal of external
personal equipment other than the overgarment (i.e., helmet, vest [aircrew], web gear,



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             VII-7
mask carrier, flak vest, and cold/wet weather gear). Most of this equipment cannot be
decontaminated to safe levels.
            (3) The CHA is where individuals remove their overgarments. The goals of the
CHA are contamination reduction in regards to processing personnel and the containment
of all contact hazards (i.e., agents in liquid or solid form) within the CCA. See Figure VII-2
and VII-3 (pages VII-9 and VII-10) for examples of a CCA layout for ground crew and
aircrew operations.
            (4) The overgarment removal area may not be necessary if the chemical threat
is low, the unit is sufficiently stocked with suits, and the resupply line is functioning. In
this case, previously used suits could be sent directly to the contaminated-waste disposal
area. However, if the threat of multiple CBRN attacks is probable, suits are in short
supply, or there is not a realistic resupply capability, then the removal area is critical to
mission sustainment. Units must perform a risk assessment before establishing an
overgarment aeration area. Personnel should consider the following when selecting a site:
                  (a) Locate the removal area as close to the CHA as possible. However,
ensure that the aeration area is downwind from the CHA and VHA transition point. Also,
ensure that the aeration area is far enough from the TFA and mask removal point that it
does not present a threat to unprotected personnel. The vapor hazard must be constantly
monitored because the collection of contaminated suits in a single area will create an
artificial hot spot.
                (b)   Ensure access to the suits for egress.
                (c) Optimize the effects of weathering. Expose the suits to high
temperatures, sunlight, and high winds; and also provide overhead cover to prevent
inadvertent recontamination.
                (d) Secure the area using available resources.
            (5) It is probable that at least two contaminated-waste areas will be
required—one within the MOB area and one in conjunction with the CCA function. Site
selection should be based on prevailing winds for the season, and the site should be located
downwind of all personnel housing and rest-and-relief locations. If sufficient equipment
exists, place automatic vapor alarms around or downwind of the area. CBRN
reconnaissance personnel should periodically monitor outside the area with a handheld
vapor detection device, such as the ICAM or the M256.
           (6) The VHA provides the last chance for the CCA staff to verify that
processing personnel are free of contamination before transitioning to the TFA. In the case
of open-air processing, there should be at least a 15-meter buffer zone between the end of
the CHA and the monitoring station. At the end of the VHA, attendants should verify that
the chemical vapor concentrations are at safe levels before they let personnel remove their
mask. A decision to remove the mask will be based on the recommended safe levels
provided. Consequently, the two-stage approach of clothing removal and monitoring is
executed throughout this area.

                 (a) Personnel must remove clothing that could be “off-gassing” in the
VHA prior to entering the TFA. Personnel should not be allowed to automatically
transition into the TFA wearing their underwear if they were not using the battle dress
uniform (BDU) option since that layer of protection would be missing. Consequently, each
installation must develop a workable CONOPS for clothing replacement.
                (b) If the threat dictates, personnel should be monitored with the ICAM
for “dusty” contamination within the VHA. The attendants’ sight and the use of M8/M9
paper are not effective, especially in the case of dusty mustard. In order to provide the
highest degree of protection for personnel, VHA attendants must routinely monitor the air
at the mask removal point.
            (7) The purpose of the mission-critical equipment (MCE) refurbishment area is
to decontaminate MCE and return it to the warfighter as quickly as possible. This area
includes refurbishment of the ground crew, firefighters, and explosive ordnance disposal
(EOD) equipment. To prevent bottlenecks during this process, this function should have
dedicated personnel when the CCA is fully operational. Regardless of whether it is a single
activity or several line-by-line activities, the personnel will require large supplies of plastic
bags, M8 paper, M291/M295 decontamination kits, sponges, and bleach. The refurbishment
area should be located outside the CCA processing lines. The refurbishment duties are
split between the CHA and the VHA. Ensure that adequate space, dedicated personnel,
and supplies are available for this tasking.
               (a) Personnel in the TFA will remain vulnerable to a new CBRN attack
and radical wind shift until their masks are returned.
               (b) Untrained personnel may inadvertently be the cause of casualties.
Extreme attention to detail is required regarding contamination identification, mask
decontamination (if appropriate), mask cleansing, and filter replacement. The eyes are the
most vulnerable part of the body, and the slightest mistake on the part of the mask
refurbishment team may result in vision problems and the immediate loss of productivity.
          (8) The transition buffer zone between the CCA and the TFA is the area where
personnel remove their masks prior to entering the TFA.
           (9)   The TFA includes accountability and logistics resupply points.
                (a) In open-air processing, the rest-and-relief area of the TFA is located at
least 200 yards outside the CCA boundary. Shifting wind directions or the accumulation of
contaminated materials (potential hazard effects from off-gassing or agent resuspension)
necessitate the need to establish the TFA far from the CCA in an open-air environment.
When overpressure systems are used, the entire structure beyond the point of the air lock is
the TFA.
                   (b) There is a requirement for the installation to operate egress
processing lines. Adequate space must be provided for sufficient egress lines to allow
personnel to process out of the TFA while keeping with shift change requirements. CCAs
should accommodate simultaneous ingress and egress lines and inhibit cross contamination
of egressing personnel. In a worst-case scenario, many lines may be necessary because
personnel would have to utilize previously used overgarments, combat boots, and clothing.
In this scenario, space would also have to exist to store these items along the egress
processing lines. There is also a space requirement for the storage of individual equipment
(i.e., web belts, canteens, first aid kits, helmets, M9 paper).

              (c) The size of the supply transition point depends on the wings CCA
implementation philosophy and the degree of contamination control utilized prior to the
attack.
                (d) The size of the TFA is the largest variable of all. An area of 200
square meters is recommended. The main housing portion of the TFA should be separated
from the CCA processing lines by the maximum distance available. A separation of at least
100 meters is recommended. A chemical-vapor detection network should exist between the
TFA and the CCA.
        (10) Other considerations during the site selection process are site security,
communications, terrain slope, and the presence of other natural features.
           (11) Optimal requirements for the CCA and TFA patient decontamination sites
include the following:
               (a) Colocation with the supported MTF (not closer than 75 meters
downwind or crosswind and situated so that arriving vehicles and casualties can reach it
without approaching the MTF).
                 (b)    Access to water (free of CBRN contaminants but not necessarily
potable).
                 (c)    Hookup to an electricity source for water pump operation and lighting.
                 (d) Approximately a 60-meter controlled perimeter and ground or floor
gradient sufficient to facilitate the drainage of contaminated water away from the
decontamination facility and MTF.
                 (e) Protection of the equipment from temperature extremes, rain, and
pilferage is required.
6.   Personnel Processing Procedures (Radiological)
     Prossessing personnel prior to actually sending them to decontamination can, in some
cases, help alleviate the need for decontamination altogether.
     a.   Site Selection of the Contamination Control Station (CCS). The following
considerations apply for CCS site selection:
      •    Locate the CCS downwind of the entry control point and operating areas, no
closer than 300 feet to the nearest hazard.
     •      Select an area that is free of weeds, brush, and rocks. A paved area is preferred.
      •    Ensure that the CCS team members monitor a 25-square-foot area around the
selected site.
                                             CAUTION
                       The runoff of removed material should be carefully
                       contained since it will remain a radiological hazard.

     b.     CCS Setup.
         (1) Setup procedures will begin after the area is monitored and deemed clear of
contamination.

           (2) Individuals setting up the CCS will don protective equipment and will
tape-up, ensuring that no skin is exposed, and determine and record background readings.
            (3) Administrative personnel will log all personnel in and out of the area and
inspect all personnel entering the area to ensure that they are properly dressed.
          (4) The team chief will inspect all CCS members and personnel processing into
the CCS for holes and tape.
     c.    CCS Activation.
           (1) As soon as it is determined that there is contamination and that personnel
are returning to the CCS, personnel in the CCS will don their masks and tape-up, ensure
that the area is cleared of unnecessary personnel and material, contact the rear line, and
report the area “hot.” The CCS is now ready for processing.
          (2) The team chief will ensure that personnel are processed by priority (e.g.,
injured, TLs), move throughout the area, and monitor all actions in the CCS.
     d.    Personnel Processing.
           (1)   Personnel will be processed on a priority basis.
           (2)   Injured personnel will be processed as follows:
            •    If by ambulance, the vehicle will be allowed to leave and the route taken
will be closed, monitored, and cleaned if it is found to be contaminated.
          •     If by litter, the person will be wrapped in a blanket and the litter will be
passed over the hot line and put into an ambulance on the clean side.
           (3) All equipment and documents will be dropped on the hot side of the
equipment drop table. Any contaminated item that needs to leave the area will be bagged.
The person requiring the item will pick it up after it has processed through the CCS. All
tape (except tape around wrists) will be removed and placed in the tape barrel (use the
buddy system).
                 (a)   Station 1.
NOTE: The person being processed is seated.
                 •     Remove the bootie nearest the hot line, and place the bootie in the
barrel.
                 •     Ensure that the foot is held in the air to be monitored for radiological
contamination.
                 •     Place the boot down on the clean side of the hot line if the boot is
clean.
                 •     Remove and remonitor the boot if it is contaminated.
                 •     Repeat procedures for the other foot.
                 •     Instruct the person not to leave the mat until directed.
                 •     Stand up on the clean side of the hot line, and proceed to the next
station.

                  (b)   Station 2.
NOTE: The person being processed will stand spread-eagle.
                  •     Conduct whole-body monitoring for alpha, beta, and gamma rays.
              •         Monitor one side of the body for alpha rays and the other side for beta
and gamma rays.
                  •     Instruct the person to turn around 180° and repeat the monitoring.
                  •     Start monitoring at the inlet valve or filter inlet on the mask.
                  •     Monitor the rest of the head and shoulders.
                  •     Monitor the body trunk with a large X formation.
                •    Instruct the individual to proceed to the medical station for processing
if no contamination is found.
                  •     Instruct the individual to proceed to Station 3 if contamination is
found.
                  (c)   Station 3.
                 •      Remove the hood from the head. If the hood unfastens from the suit,
take it off and put it in the barrel.
                  •     Remove the protective clothing.
                  •     Place the clothing in the barrel.
                  •     Proceed to Station 4.
                  (d)   Station 4.
                  •     Use the same procedures as Station 2.
                 •   Have the person remove his outer clothing and place it in the barrel at
Station 3 if contamination is found.
                  •     Have the person return to Station 4 for remonitoring if contamination
is found.
                •    Have the person remove his mask and proceed to the medical station
if no contamination is found.
                •   Have the person put on clean protective clothing, and transport him to
the supporting MTF for decontamination if contamination is still found.
                  •     Ensure that all personnel exit through the medical station.
     e.    Area Expansion. Establish another personnel processing line or a new area if
the existing area becomes too congested.
     f.      CCS Shutdown. Use the following procedures for shutdown:
         •   Monitor, clean, and discard (as required) all area equipment and material.
         •   Monitor the area for remaining contamination.
         •   Request assistance from specialized teams if the area is still contaminated.

               AIRCRAFT AND AIRCREW DECONTAMINATION


1.   Background
      This chapter addresses aircraft and aircraft cargo decontamination (i.e., general
planning, aircraft decontamination planning, aircraft decontamination levels and
procedures, civil air fleet and contract airlift decontamination, aircraft munitions
decontamination, and air cargo decontamination). For more detailed TTP for air and naval
forces aircraft and aircrew decontamination, see AFMAN 10-2602.
2.   General Planning
      The protection of aircraft and aircrews is of utmost importance during a CBRN threat.
The ultimate goal is to minimize sortie generation degradation (by limiting the number of
personnel that are exposed, the amount of equipment exposed to the contamination, and
the time spent in IPE). The following factors should be considered during decontamination
planning:
      a.    Combatant commanders have the responsibility to designate a decontamination
location and coordinate approval with the HNs. AB, airfield, and FARP commanders and
officers in charge must organize the capabilities and personnel of permanent, tenant, and
transient organizations to support decontamination operations.
            (1) Infrastructure factors that should be considered during the site selection
process include the adequacy of the aircraft ramp area, access to water (free of
contaminants but not necessarily potable), prevailing winds, the slope of the terrain,
security, and hookup to electricity or an electric generator (for water pump operation,
lighting, billeting, communications, etc.).
           (2) The goal is to eliminate or reduce the contamination and restore the
mission-critical resources to a condition that permits unrestricted use, handling, and
operation.
          (3) Thorough decontamination operations will be conducted after hostile
actions have terminated, when the commander determines it is in the unit’s best interest,
or when directed by higher authority.
     b.  Operational units shall coordinate locations for parking the contaminated and
uncontaminated aircraft, the location of aircraft and aircrew decontamination sites,
maintenance personnel decontamination sites, and the retrogradation or disposal of
contaminated equipment and consumables with host commands.
     c.   Aircraft are most vulnerable while they are on the ground and not protected by
overhead cover. For this reason, taxi time should be minimized and every effort made to
take advantage of available cover.
     d.   Units and activities place special emphasis on securing the aircraft points of
ingress and egress by closing or covering cockpits, doors, and ramps when the aircraft is not
in use and prior to decontamination.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              VIII-1
     e.    The priority of the decontamination should support sortie generation.
Maintenance procedures shall address the decontamination considerations (such as covered
areas for parking, inspections, servicing, munitions/pod/tank loading and unloading,
arming and dearming, and washing) prior to maintenance. The predecontamination
procedures focus on the following areas:
         (1) Protecting critical assets, using detection devices, marking and segregating
contaminated equipment, and removing and replacing contaminated coverings.
Commanders should use the contaminated equipment for contaminated operations.
           (2) Receiving and providing disposition of contaminated equipment or products
(e.g., support equipment, munitions, fuel, and spare parts). Actions may include moving
equipment and aircraft through a decontamination line or outside of the maintenance areas
for weathering.
      f.    Aircraft returning from missions may present little or no threat of contamination
to the airfield or facility. Contaminated aircraft will be directed to an alternate
(contaminated) airfield before landing (if possible). The following actions are applicable in a
CBRN environment:
           (1) Use monitoring equipment to detect contamination on the aircraft and
aircrew, and report the results.
              (2)   Remain in IPE until decontaminated.
          (3) Complete the immediate decontamination efforts as quickly as possible
once contamination is detected. Decontamination activities must be completed before the
agent absorbs into the surface (typically within minutes from the time of agent contact).
               (a) Be aware of the locations of nonporous surfaces where the liquid may
stay. Though these surfaces are the most receptive to decontamination, they also represent
the most dangerous areas for liquid transfer and vapor hazard.
                (b) Avoid exposing personnel to porous surfaces (e.g., painted metal or
rubber) that will sorb chemical agents. Although sorption minimizes the liquid transfer
hazard, the vapor hazard remains.
              (4)   Perform the required servicing on the aircraft.
         g.   Special Considerations.
          (1) Operational and thorough decontamination procedures are similar to
aircraft maintenance corrosion control.
           (2) Key leadership and installation personnel must realize that there are
limitations associated with decontamination efforts and form realistic expectations for an
effective decontamination.
           (3) CBRN agents can infiltrate the aircraft interior through the aircraft
environmental control system and contaminate the cockpit area and avionics bay. The
principal chemical-agent challenge to avionics components is vapor, regardless of the type
of agent.
           (4) The sensitivity of electrical equipment to chlorine or other water-based
solutions severely limits its feasibility for decontamination.




VIII-2                   FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60      4 April 2006
           (5) Units conduct operational and thorough decontamination planning by
identifying C2 relationships, team requirements, equipment requirements,
decontamination assets, and contaminated-waste collection points. Team checklists guide
the decontamination team activities. These plans and checklists are focused on the unit
tasks (such as critical cargo movement and postconflict decontamination operations).
Requirements that exceed the unit or activity resources are included in the resource
requests.
           (6) No effective chemical compound is available for thorough aircraft
decontamination. STB corrodes the metal components and the aircraft skin. Immediate
decontamination may be performed using the service-authorized decontamination kits or
solutions.
3.   Aircraft Decontamination Levels and Procedures
      The levels of decontamination for aircraft are the same as those described in Chapter I
(immediate, operational, thorough, and clearance). However, this section will address only
the first three levels. Aircrew decontamination procedures are outlined in Chapters III, IV,
and VII.
     a.  Immediate Decontamination. There are three components of immediate
decontamination. They are skin decontamination, personal wipe down, and spot
decontamination. Skin decontamination and personal wipe down are described in Chapter
III.
     b.    Spot Decontamination. Spot decontamination is an immediate decontamination
technique that will normally be performed on aircraft that have been recovered and will be
quickly turned around for continued flight operations. Spot decontamination reduces the
contamination on areas that must be touched during an operation and while servicing the
aircraft. Conducting spot decontamination will reduce contamination and limit its spread.
The following steps should be used for conducting spot decontamination ashore or afloat:
          (1)   Spot Decontamination of Fixed-Wing Ejection Seat Aircraft and
Helicopters.
                 (a) Determine a location for the decontamination. The location to conduct
spot decontamination depends on the operating cycle, the space available (ship or facility),
and the size of the aircraft being decontaminated.
                (b) Spot decontamination should be performed by the crew, division,
team, or work section responsible for the service being performed. All personnel involved in
spot decontamination shall wear appropriate nonaircrew MOPP gear. Wet-weather
clothing may be worn over MOPP gear to prevent the saturation of the nonaircrew
protective ensemble. Table VIII-1 (page VIII-4) and the following list, provide a baseline for
the areas that should be decontaminated prior to servicing the aircraft:
                •    Refueling access.
                •    Ordnance, armament, and equipment.
                •    Ingress and egress (ladders, handholds, footholds, steps, etc.).
                •    Preflight and postflight check areas.
                •    Inspection areas.

                      •     Support equipment (seats, controls, chocks, chains, etc.).
                      •     Aircraft tie-down and tow points.

                    (c)     The procedures for spot decontamination are as follows:
                  •    Make available sufficient quantities of soapy water or applicable
 aircraft cleaner and fresh water.
                 •    Scrub the service areas using brushes, rags, or sponges with soapy
 water until deposited CB material, dirt, and grime are removed.
                    •       Rinse with fresh water from a bucket or hose.
                    •       Decontaminate gloves.
                    •       Perform service.
                •     Decontaminate runoff cleaner by applying standard or nonstandard
 decontaminant to the deck, ground, and airfield; and then hose overboard or into collection
 sumps. If runoff is hosed without prior decontamination, it should be treated as
 contaminated.
              (2) Spot Decontamination of Large-Frame, Fixed-Wing, Nonejection Aircraft.
 If mission requirements do not allow ample time for operational decontamination or
 weathering, provide spot decontamination of large-frame aircraft. Large-frame aircraft
 (i.e., C-5, C-17, C130, and C141) will normally operate from an open ramp without cover
 while on the ground for a short period of time. Their vulnerability to CBRN contamination
 on the ground will result from being outside and unprotected at the time of a chemical
 attack. Additionally, the size of the aircraft makes spot decontamination a much larger

task. Contamination can also transfer from contaminated personnel or cargo allowed on
the aircraft.
NOTE: These procedures are written in generic form to cover all large-frame
aircraft and require the user’s knowledge of the applicable aircraft. For example,
the C-5 user would understand that decontamination of the cargo ramp area
would include both forward and aft ramps while the C-17, C-130, and C-141 users
would only be concerned with single aft ramps.

                                             CAUTION
                      Ensure that all decontaminants used in these
                      procedures are authorized in appropriate aircraft and
                      maintenance manuals before execution. Failure to do
                      so may violate maintenance instructions and damage
                      the aircraft.

                (a) A TL directs the efforts of two-person teams as they decontaminate
the aircraft. The TL can be any maintenance specialty code, military occupational specialty
(MOS), or Navy enlisted classification (NEC); but it is recommended that a qualified
aircraft crew chief be used. The mechanics performing as members of the two-person teams
can be any maintenance specialty code, MOS, or NEC provided they are familiar with the
ground handling and flight line safety procedures for the applicable aircraft and can work
in full MOPP gear.
                  (b) Three two-person teams designated as Teams A, B, and C are
recommended. The number of personnel can be adjusted based on the availability and
workload, provided the two-person team concept is not violated. Tasks are designated by
the letter (A, B, or C) of the team doing the work, but these team designations are optional
if more or less personnel are used.
                (c) The TL assembles the full team at the nose of the aircraft for a
situation and safety briefing. He uses the applicable aircraft ground handling TM or TO to
make the aircraft safe for maintenance. He briefs personnel on the absolute necessity of
operating in two-person teams and the use of the “buddy system” to enhance personal
decontamination and safety throughout the operation. The TL also performs the following
duties:
                •     Ensures that the required supplies are available (such as M295 kits,
M9 tape, shuffle box, logbook, bags, heavy-duty plastic).
              •    Ensures that the required equipment is available (such as handheld
radios and ICAMs/CAMs).
               •     Uses M295 kits to spot-decontaminate ground fire extinguisher(s) to
ensure that they are available in an emergency.
               •    Assigns two-person inspection teams to inspect and
spot-decontaminate portions of the aircraft interior and exterior.
                (d)   Team A performs the following duties:
                •    Inspects (using the appropriate detection device) and
spot-decontaminates the crew entry area. Pays particular attention to the crew entry
doors, ladder, and handrail.

                •     Places the shuffle box with absorbent at the foot of the ladder.
                 •   Cleans feet in the shuffle box prior to entering the aircraft, checks
each other for contamination (decontaminate if necessary), and proceeds up the ladder into
the aircraft.
                •     Inspects and decontaminates any contamination present onboard in
the crew entry area, to include the galley and closest floorboards.
                •     Exits the aircraft and reports the findings to the TL for entry into the
log.
                •     Disposes of the waste in the garbage bag.
                •    Inspects (using ICAMs/CAMs or the appropriate detection device) and
spot-decontaminates the ground interphone connection/door. Pays particular attention to
the cable connection area and door latches.
                •     Reports the findings to the TL for entry into the log.

                 (g) The TL reviews the aircraft forms and directs the teams to
spot-decontaminate any areas of the aircraft requiring access for maintenance (engine
nacelle latches, access panels, tires). The TL reports any abnormal findings or actions to
the maintenance and operations sections. He also accounts for all team members.
      c.    Operational Decontamination. The goal of operational decontamination is to
limit the spread of contamination and to minimize the hazards to personnel, while allowing
operations to continue. The following procedures apply to ejection seat aircraft, large-frame
aircraft, and helicopters. Detailed aspects of specific operational personnel and equipment
procedures for air and naval forces are addressed in AFMAN 10-2602.
            (1) Responsibilities. Aerial ports of embarkation (APOEs) and APODs will
concentrate the decontamination efforts on operational decontamination during hostilities.
Thorough and clearance decontamination are generally conducted following the end of
hostilities. The magnitude of this effort will depend upon the type and concentration of
contamination, mission requirements, and available resources. Commanders conduct
operational decontamination to minimize contact hazards, accelerate the weathering
process, and limit cross contamination of mission-critical resources. Performing aircraft
wash down within 1 to 6 hours of contamination will speed the weathering process and may
allow the aircraft to be operated and maintained in reduced aircrew IPE or MOPP levels.
Aircraft operational decontamination is accomplished by decontaminating surfaces (exterior
and interior) that must be touched during aircraft servicing and operations.
           (2)   Preparation.
                (a) Areas. Multiple areas will need to be set up, marked, and maintained
within zones to effectively control or eliminate the potential for cross contamination. The
locations depend on the operating cycle, the space available (facility or ship), and the type of
aircraft being decontaminated. Figures VIII-1 and VIII-2 (page VIII-10) depict examples of
stationary aircraft decontamination areas.
                 (b) Water. The site must have sufficient fresh water to wet the entire
exterior of the aircraft. For planning purposes, the following recommendations are
provided: CH46E, 250 gallons; CH53E, 350 gallons; F/A18, 300 gallons; and C130, 800
gallons.
NOTE: Water requirements are approximations. The water requirements for
specific aircraft should be based on the surface area compared to the
recommended water volumes provided above.
               (c) Equipment. Washing equipment that can produce 60 to 120 psi of
water pressure is preferred. The capacity to heat water and inject soap increases the

effectiveness. The lack of pressurized washing equipment decreases the effectiveness of the
wash down and may require scrubbing to achieve the desired effect. The M17 lightweight
decontamination systems (USMC), M12 PDDA, standard water pumps, and pressure
washers, and firefighting equipment are examples of standard and field-expedient
equipment.

                (d) Decontamination Area or Pad. A suitable remote site that is at least
500 feet away from all other flight line activities must be selected to conduct aircraft
decontamination. The decontamination pad must have enough space so that all of the
drainage and wastewater runoff is collected and contained. The establishment and
enforcement of an entry control point is required to control and monitor access to the
decontamination pad.
                 (e) Containment Area. An aircraft decontamination containment area
should be large enough to completely cover the ground under the entire aircraft and catch
all the contaminated runoff water. The construction of the pad should be of a waterproof
material (vinyl, plastic, or tarp) with suitable sides (berm) to control and contain the water
or decontaminant runoff. Operational decontamination sites established at wash racks will
require a containment feature (such as sandbags, sand-filled fire hoses, or commercially
available containment berms or pools) that is large enough to accommodate the aircraft
being washed and to prevent runoff from spreading contamination. The pad size will vary
based on the type of aircraft requiring decontamination and must be built to accommodate
the largest known contaminated aircraft. Sample aircraft sizes and recommended pad
containment areas are given in Table VIII-2.

                 (f) Overspray or Splatter Hazard Area. Another factor to consider is the
potential for an overspray or splatter hazard during decontamination operations. The
liquid containment system associated with a ground barrier is designed to allow the
wastewater to be collected in an appropriate container, pending further analysis and proper
disposal. If possible, establish the decontamination area at a 20° angle to the prevailing
winds. Using this method, the concentration of trailing vapor hazards will be significantly
reduced.
                 (g) Site. Sewer drains must be plugged, and a system for containing
discarded wastewater must be established using a temporary berm. Ensure that the
ground slope allows the runoff to flow to the downwind side of the washing operation but
still be retained in the area so that it will not cross contaminate other areas. All
wastewater used in the decontamination process will need to be collected and tested.
                (h) Wastewater Storage. Wastewater storage tanks should be available to
store runoff. In areas where sufficient natural drainage exists to carry wastewater away
from the operation, wastewater lagoons could be constructed to provide a holding area for
the wastewater, pending proper disposal. If lagoons are utilized, they must be established
downwind of the decontamination area, properly marked, and fenced. Because of the large
construction requirements, lagoons should only be used as a last resort.
                (i.) Collection System. The design of the collection system largely
depends on the specific site conditions such as the slope of the land, soil composition, and
wind direction. Planners must also consider piping and sump pumps to move contaminated


4 April 2006               FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          VIII-11
water into storage tanks or a holding lagoon. The quantity and selection of piping and
pumps depend on the slope and distance from the decontamination pad to the holding
tanks.
            (3) Procedures. Aircraft wash-down techniques are employed to reduce the
levels of contamination on the aircraft between sorties (when time allows). An aircraft
wash down should be performed as a minimum contamination reduction measure when
time does not permit a more extensive decontamination.
                (a) All personnel involved in the aircraft wash down shall wear the
appropriate MOPP gear prior to the aircraft entering the decontamination site.
Wet-weather clothing or TAP aprons worn over MOPP gear is recommended to prevent the
saturation of the nonaircrew protective ensemble.
               (b) Personnel place the appropriate barrier and contamination hazard
markings prior to commencing the wash down. They erect barriers to isolate the
decontamination site. Appropriate (CB) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
contamination markers should be attached to the rope barrier to warn personnel of a
contamination hazard.
                 (c) Aircraft stands or ladders should be available to the spray areas
inaccessible from the ground or deck. As a last resort, decontamination personnel can climb
on the aircraft.
                (d)   The aircraft is towed or taxied into position.
                 (e) The aircrew egress. If contaminated, the aircrew must remain with
the aircraft in IPE or may be directed to a personnel decontamination site (shore-based) or
CCA (ship) for the removal of contaminated IPE and flight gear.
                (f)   The crew closes all of the hatches, doors, and windows on the aircraft.
                 (g) Warm, soapy water is applied to the aircraft. Spray should be applied
to the aircraft working upwind to downwind and top to bottom. Do not neglect the landing
gear and the belly of the aircraft. Angle the spray streams from 15° to 30° in order to avoid
water being introduced behind the hatch and cover seams that house the sensitive aircraft
components. Control the overspray to avoid transferring the contaminated runoff to
personnel or to areas outside the decontamination barrier.

                                               CAUTION
                  Consult the appropriate aircraft maintenance publications for
                  areas that could be damaged by the application of water spray.
                  Prepare these areas for aircraft wash down as specified in TMs
                  for normal washing. The spray streams should be angled from
                  15° to 30° in order to avoid water being introduced behind the
                  hatch and cover seams that house the sensitive aircraft
                  components. Ensure that only approved aircraft cleaners are
                  used. The overspray should be controlled to avoid transferring
                  contaminated runoff to personnel or to areas outside of the
                  decontamination barrier.


                (h)   Rinse. Perform this optional step for corrosion control purposes if
time allows.



VIII-12               FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60           4 April 2006
                 (i) Check the interior for liquid or solid contamination. If contamination
is discovered, spot-decontaminate by wiping with rags dipped in warm, soapy water or
another approved aircraft cleaner.
                (j)   Move the aircraft to an area where it can weather.
                (k)   Repeat steps 3 (a) through (j) as required.
           (4) Site Close-Out. At the end of the decontamination procedures, the
decontamination pad must be cleaned with a standard or nonstandard decontamination
solution to ensure that all traces of contamination have been neutralized. Additionally, the
planners should consider that all joint- or crack-sealing material will need to be removed
and replaced.
      d.   Thorough Decontamination. The goal of a thorough decontamination is to reduce
contamination to negligible levels or to eliminate it so that aircraft can be operated and
maintained safely for extended periods of time without aircrew IPE or nonaircrew IPE.
Thorough decontamination consists of personnel and equipment decontamination. Detailed
aspects of specific thorough personnel and equipment decontamination for air and naval
forces are addressed in AFMAN 10-2602. This section primarily addresses thorough
aircraft decontamination procedures for forces operating ashore. Thorough personnel
decontamination is outlined in Chapter V.
           (1) The DAD restores items so that they can be used without aircrew IPE or
nonaircrew IPE. Normally, the DED and the DAD are conducted as part of a reconstitution
or during breaks in combat operations.
            (2) The thorough decontamination of aircraft is costly in terms of time and
resources. A critical limitation to aircraft thorough decontamination is decontamination of
the interior. Electronics, electrical systems, and other sensitive components of cockpits,
flight decks, and cargo areas can become damaged if subjected to the volume of water that
would have to be introduced in order to effectively remove contamination from these areas.
As discussed, there are currently no available decontamination technologies, other than
using standard aircraft soaps and cleaners to displace contamination from an aircraft.
Therefore, in considering thorough decontamination of an aircraft, commanders must first
determine the extent of the contamination to the interior spaces of the aircraft. If these
spaces are heavily contaminated, it may make more sense to operationally decontaminate
the exterior of the aircraft, spot-decontaminate the interior of the aircraft, and allow the
aircraft to weather to an acceptable level instead of spending the resources to conduct a
thorough decontamination of the exterior, knowing that spot decontamination of the
interior is the best that can be achieved with the current decontamination technology.
           (3) The procedures for DAD are similar to those for operational
decontamination. The principal difference between the two techniques is the amount of
time that is required. There is a stationary, single-station method and a five-station
method for conducting DAD. In either method, DAD will take longer because of the
requirement to scrub the aircraft. Scrubbing the aircraft with soap will assist with the
contaminant removal process and increase the effectiveness of decontamination. All
personnel involved in the DAD may wear the appropriate rain gear. Rain gear is
recommended to prevent the saturation of the nonaircrew protective ensemble.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          VIII-13
                 (a) Determine the Location for the Decontamination. The location to
conduct aircraft decontamination is dependent on the operating cycle, space available at the
facility, and the type of aircraft being decontaminated.
                 (b) Conduct Site Preparation. Considerations for selecting a thorough
decontamination site and the preparation of that site are similar to those discussed in
operational decontamination (paragraph 3c). Thorough decontamination will require more
logistics support. For planning purposes, the following recommendations are provided: CH­
46E, 500 gallons; CH-53E, 700 gallons; and C130, 1600 gallons. Containment at the DAD
will have to be increased to hold the additional runoff.
NOTE: Water requirements are approximations. The water requirements for
specific aircraft should be based on the surface area compared to the
recommended water volumes provided above.
               (c)   Perform Single-Station Procedures.
                •     Tow or taxi the aircraft into position; and close all of the hatches,
doors, and windows on the aircraft. Prepare the aircraft the same as for a normal washing,
and then initiate the decontamination process.
                •     Apply warm, soapy water to the outside of the aircraft. Spray should
be applied to the aircraft, working from upwind to downwind and top to bottom.

                                             CAUTION
                 Consult appropriate aircraft maintenance publications for areas
                 that could be damaged by the application of water spray.
                 Prepare these areas for aircraft wash down as specified in TMs
                 for normal washing. Spray streams should be angled from 15°
                 to 30° in order to avoid water being introduced behind the hatch
                 and cover seams that house sensitive aircraft components.
                 Ensure that only approved aircraft cleaners are used. The
                 overspray should be controlled to avoid transferring
                 contaminated runoff to other personnel or to areas outside of
                 the decontamination barrier.


                 •     Apply appropriate aircraft cleaner or soap to the exterior of the
aircraft using long-handled brushes or nonabrasive scrub pads. Scrub the soap into the
exterior surfaces of the aircraft, working from upwind to downwind and top to bottom. Pay
particular attention to the areas where contamination tends to accumulate, such as landing
gear, landing gear bays, tires, and areas with POL.
                 •    Check the interior spaces with a CAM/ICAM or M8 paper. If
contamination is discovered or suspected, spot-decontaminate these areas with rags or
sponges dipped in warm, soapy water or with another approved aircraft cleaner. Wring-out
the excess water to avoid contaminated runoff. Porous material such as cargo straps, seats,
and seat belts cannot be effectively spot-decontaminated. These items and other porous
items should be removed and weathered or discarded. Personnel performing the interior
decontamination must ensure that they are not transferring contamination inside of the
aircraft. If necessary, decontaminate the footgear and gloves before entering the aircraft.

                 •    Apply rinse water to the outside of the aircraft. Spray should be
applied to the aircraft, working from upwind to downwind and top to bottom. Heated water
will aid in contamination removal.

                                           WARNING
                      Overspray should be controlled to avoid
                      transferring the contaminated runoff to personnel
                      or to areas outside of the decontamination barrier.




                                             CAUTION
                      Consult the appropriate aircraft maintenance
                      publications for areas that could be damaged by the
                      application of water spray. Spray streams should be
                      angled from 15° to 30° to avoid water being introduced
                      behind the hatch and cover seams that house the
                      sensitive aircraft components.



                 •    Check for contamination. Use the CAM/ICAM, M8A1, M22 ACADA,
MK26 Ship ACADA, M256/M256A1, or biological handheld assay (HHA) (as required) to
check the exterior for contamination. If contamination is found, recycle the aircraft
according to the command guidance or segregate the aircraft from personnel and other
aircraft for the weathering process to lower contamination levels.
               (d)   Perform Five-Station Procedures.
                •   CBRN units may set up, operate, and close the DAD portion of the
thorough decontamination operation. Table VIII-3 (page VIII-16) shows the personnel and
equipment requirements for the five-station DAD. The site setup is the same for CBR. The
DAD area is composed of primary wash, decontaminant solution application, contact time
and interior decontamination, rinse, and check stations (see Figure VIII-3, page VIII-17).

                •    The representative actions that are taken at each station are as
follows:
                    o     Station 1: Primary Wash. At this station, gross contamination is
removed from the aircraft. The aircraft is sprayed for 2 to 3 minutes with hot, soapy water.


                                         WARNING
                    To prevent damage, avoid hitting the aircraft’s skin
                    at a 90° angle. Also avoid the sensitive areas
                    shown in Figures VIII-4 and VIII-5.

                    o     Station 2: Decontaminant Application. At this station, a
decontamination solution is applied using a decontamination apparatus such as the M12A1
PDDE or the M17 LDS (in the siphon injector mode). After the solution is applied, a
member of the scrubbing team scrubs the aircraft skin. This allows the chemical agent to
mix with the decontamination solution (especially when thickened chemical agents are
present). STB and HTH should not be used because of their corrosive nature.
                       o     Station 3: Contact Time and Interior Decontamination. At this
station, the decontamination solution is allowed to completely neutralize the chemical
agent; also, the interior of the aircraft is decontaminated (if necessary). The aircraft will
remain in Station 3 at least 30 minutes. The decontamination solution reacts with most
chemical agents within 5 minutes. However, allowing the decontamination solution to
remain on the contaminated surface for 30 minutes should ensure a complete
neutralization.
                          •     Inspect the interior of the aircraft for liquid contamination
using the CAM/ICAM and M8 detector paper. If a liquid-chemical contamination is
identified, decontaminate the interior of the aircraft.

                                        WARNING
                       Personnel should not be in the aircraft during
                       this operation.

                         •    Decontaminate the aircraft’s interior with hot, soapy water
as long as maintenance personnel approve the use of it on certain pieces of equipment. Use
IEDKs or damp, soapy washcloths to decontaminate optical and electrical equipment and
instruments.
NOTE: The IEDK leaves a charcoal residue on surfaces.
                           •    Use a radiac meter for radiological contamination to
determine the extent and location of the contamination inside the aircraft. If there is
contamination, determine the intensity of the contamination. If the contamination has an
intensity greater than 0.33 cGy, decontaminate the interior of the aircraft. Use hot, soapy
water to wash the contaminated areas and a sponge to mop up the water and the
contamination.
                      o     Station 4: Rinse. Removed the decontamination solution is from
the aircraft. Spray the aircraft with water from top to bottom. Take care not to damage the
aircraft skin. This station will use about 250 gallons of water.

                                       CAUTION
                 Failure to remove all of the decontamination
                 solution from the aircraft skin may cause corrosion.


                     o     Station 5: Check. At this station, the completeness of the
decontamination is checked. Detection procedures vary depending on the type of
contamination. If significant contamination is found on the aircraft, recycle it to Station 2
for chemical contamination or to Station 1 for radiological contamination.
                            •    Use the ICAM to check for the presence of vapors. If the
ICAM indicates the presence of vapors, use the M8 detector paper to check for liquid
contamination. If it is suspected that these are producing a false positive, use an M256A1
detector kit to confirm or deny the presence of contamination. If the aircraft has significant
contamination remaining, recycle it. Desorption of chemical agents may occur after the
decontamination. On CARC-painted surfaces, the desorption of vapors will stop sooner
than on alkyd-painted surfaces.
                          •     Use the radiac meter to determine if any contamination
remains. If so, determine the intensity of the contamination.
                  •    The commander establishes the recycle criteria before starting a
decontamination operation. If contamination is detected at Station 5, the recycle criteria
are used to determine which aircraft are returned to Station 2 or, if radiologically
contaminated, to Station 1. If the unit has sufficient time and resources available, the
aircraft still having detectable levels of contamination should be recycled. However, time
and resources are usually limited and not all aircraft can be recycled.
     e.   Operational and Thorough Decontamination. Operational and thorough
decontamination sites for aircraft must be selected with care. The decontamination area
must be large enough for the required number of aircraft, have an available water source,



VIII-20              FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
and allow for adequate drainage. The sites should be relatively secure; however, they
should be close enough to the AOs to allow for a reasonably quick turnaround of the
aircraft. The sites should not have less than a 5 percent slope. Decontamination sites
should be integrated into the tactical plan.
4.   Civil Reserve Air Fleet and Contract Airlift Operations
     The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) and contract airlift crews are provided ground
crew CW defense ensembles for emergency use. Crews receive just-in-time training in
order to quickly and properly don the suit and proceed to a protective shelter. Civil crews
are not expected to sustain operations in a CB environment. Therefore, they have no
decontamination capability.
     a.    Civil aircraft are not usually modified for operations in a CBRN environment.
     b.  Civil aircrews are not obligated or trained to fly into a contaminated
environment. The CRAF will not intentionally operate in a known contaminated
environment.
     c.   If an aircraft becomes contaminated while on the ground, the crew will be
evacuated by the first available means and the aircraft will be grounded until it is
decontaminated.
5.   Aircraft Munitions Decontamination
     This paragraph addresses aircraft munitions; specifically, contaminated munitions
assets, the decontamination of munitions assets, and the handling of contaminated waste.
      a.   Munitions personnel must possess an immediate decontamination capability for
themselves (M291 and M295 decontamination kits, and glove and boot decontamination
troughs with 5 percent chlorine solutions) and an operational decontamination capability
for munitions, assets, and vehicles. For the decontamination operations to be beneficial,
the site personnel must initiate the decontamination shortly after the onset of
contamination since there will not be sufficient time for off-site personnel to arrive and
conduct the decontamination operations.
      b.    If the aircraft munitions are contaminated while in the storage area, the
munitions handlers maintain MOPP4 (even if the aircraft parking area and other resources
are uncontaminated). If dealing with contaminated individually wrapped trailers in the
flight line weapons storage area, the weapons load crew removes the barrier material and
disposes of it as contaminated waste before transporting the load to the aircraft parking
area. However, if positioning the weapons without overhead cover for more than 1 hour at
(or in the immediate vicinity of) the aircraft parking area, the weapons load crew replaces
the barrier material before leaving for the site.
          (1) Because of the hazard that is imbedded in contaminated munitions
equipment and weapons, munitions personnel must conspicuously identify the
contaminated assets and keep them separated from the uncontaminated resources
(whenever possible). Contaminated munitions remain hazardous to unprotected personnel
for extended periods.
           (2) Contaminated munitions should be hung on the contaminated aircraft. If it
is necessary to use the contaminated munitions on uncontaminated aircraft, ordnance shall
be decontaminated before applying it to an aircraft.



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            VIII-21
           (3) If the munitions area is contaminated and the weapons build process did
not have an overhead cover, the commanders should determine the need for additional
weapons during this period. If the munitions operation built enough weapons for the next
24 hours, it may not be necessary to continue building bombs in the first few hours after an
attack. Munitions work crews should conduct decontamination of the munitions area,
munitions equipment, and munitions.
         (4) The supervisors and munitions work crews shall ensure that the
contamination status of munitions and equipment is clearly marked.
      c.   For the decontamination operations to be beneficial, the individual vehicle and
equipment operators must immediately decontaminate the parts of the munitions assets
that will be touched within 15 minutes of being contaminated. Units may organize and
equip contamination control teams to support sustained operations. They use the team
concept (normally two members) to assist unit personnel in developing and executing the
immediate decontamination measures, resupplying the unit with decontaminants, and
collecting and disposing of contaminated waste.
           (1) There is no need for extensive decontamination of each contaminated piece
of ordnance, vehicle, or equipment (trailer, bomb loader, etc.) as long as the personnel
clearly identify the contaminated assets as containing a residual hazard. The operator’s or
work center’s accomplishment of the immediate decontamination using M295
decontamination kits will suffice to continue the mission operations. The decontamination
operations will not produce significant results once the agent has sorbed into the paint or
other absorbent surfaces. Depending on the surface, this sorption takes place in periods
ranging from less than 1 minute up to 1 hour. Regardless of the decontamination technique
used, it will be relatively easy to remove agents from the smooth panels before they absorb
into the surface. However, the CBRN agents will tend to remain at low levels in crevices,
rivet heads, and joints.
          (2) The majority of munitions assets on installations use paint with
polyurethane compounds. Chemical agents readily sorb into this type of paint. Thus, the
decontamination operations will not have a significant effect unless they take place within
minutes after the time of contamination. Timely decontamination will reduce the residual
contact hazard. Impermeable surfaces (arming wires and other unpainted metal
components) do not allow the agent to penetrate. Therefore, these locations represent the
most dangerous areas on the contaminated assets.
           (3) Plastic and rubber components are porous materials, and the agents easily
soak into these components. While the use of the M295 decontamination kit or a 5 percent
chlorine solution will effectively reduce or eliminate the operational contact hazard, the
agent will remain imbedded in the material and an off-gassing hazard will remain.
           (4) There are no effective, operationally feasible methods for completely
decontaminating canvas storage covers, webbing, and other textile materials contaminated
with liquid chemical agents. These items will have to be weathered or removed and treated
as contaminated waste.

6.       Air Cargo Movement Decontamination
     Contamination can significantly disrupt the air and ground cargo movements if the
cargo handlers do not plan and execute preattack and postattack actions. The commanders
must identify and coordinate the task priorities, obtaining additional support when needed.
      a.    Cargo handlers must effectively employ preattack and postattack measures to
minimize mission degradation and enable sustained operations. This includes the
coordinated use of a system that balances the mission criticality level (importance) of the
cargo with the hazard category (residual danger) associated with the materials to
determine the appropriate action. The cargo handlers will require assistance from their
unit CBRN reconnaissance team and CBRN specialists to determine the degree of
contamination that is present on the cargo, cargo storage areas, and cargo movement areas.
Personnel controlling the cargo movement will use Table VIII-4 to identify the mission
criticality of the material and will conspicuously mark the relative code on the cargo.
                        Table VIII-4. Cargo Movement Mission Criticality Level
 Mission Criticality                                          Definition
       Level
C—Critical               The cargo is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 4 hours,
                         regardless of the existence of contamination.
P—Priority               The cargo is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 12 hours,
                         regardless of the existence of contamination.
A—Accelerated            The cargo is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 24 hours,
                         regardless of the existence of contamination.
R—Routine                The mission can be delayed until contamination levels, such as MOPP4 are not
                         required, regardless of how long it takes the contamination to dissipate.
N—Negligible             The mission can be delayed until there is no measurable contamination. This
                         type of cargo should not be accepted inside the cargo movement area. Room
                         must be saved for higher priority cargo.

     b.      Table VIII-5 may be used to determine the hazard category associated with the
cargo.
                                 Table VIII-5. Cargo Movement Hazard Category
 Hazard                                                Definition
Category
     1       Actual or suspected surface disposition of biological pathogens
     2       HD, L, or GB vapor present without contact hazard
     3       VL or L contact hazard present without measurable vapor hazard
     4       HD or GB contact hazard combined with a medium level of danger associated with vapor
             concentrations (4 to 5 CAM/ICAM bars with HD and up to 6 CAM/ICAM bars with GB)
     5       HD, L, GB, or VX contact hazard combined with a high level of danger associated with vapor
             concentrations (6 or more ICAM/CAM bars with HD, positive M256A1 tab for L, 7 or more
             ICAM/CAM bars with GB, or 6 or more CAM/ICAM bars with VX)
             NOTE: In the case of GB, high vapor hazard alone can drive this category designation.

      c.    In addition to the required CBRN reconnaissance, self-aid, and buddy care
activities, cargo handlers accomplish the following actions. The timing of the postattack
reconnaissance and self-aid buddy care activities depend on the situation, the direction
from the installation, and the unit chain of command. Unless otherwise directed, do not

accomplish the following actions until after the liquid deposition phase of the attack has
ended.
          (1) Determine the contamination status of each individual cargo pallet.
Annotate and report the results to the commander.
            (2) Remove and replace the covering within 6 hours (the sooner the better) if a
single sheet of plastic is protecting the contaminated assets. Carefully remove the outer
layer and replace it as time permits if a double or triple sheet of plastic or canvas is
protecting the contaminated assets,. Carefully roll the material so that the contaminated
side is rolled to the inside, and discard the material as contaminated waste.
           (3) Mark the item as contaminated according to the unit marking procedures
(NBC marking kit, signs on all sides) if barrier material is not protecting the contaminated
cargo. Attach each type of signs to the cargo if it is contaminated with more than one type
of agent (e.g., CB).
             (4) Annotate the front of the appropriate NBC marking kit sign with the
mission criticality and hazard category designator for prioritizing the cargo movement. The
code for the mission criticality designator will be the first letter of the appropriate word
(i.e., “C” represents critical and “N” represents negligible). The code for the hazard category
is the number designator itself (i.e., “3” represents a contact hazard without a measurable
vapor hazard).
           (5) Annotate the specific agent, date, time of marking, and temperature (F or
Celsius [C]) at the time of the marking operation on the rear of the marking sign. If using
the DOD sampling kits (biological-agent samplers), annotate on the rear of the sign
whether the HHA tests are positive or negative.
                 (6)   Report the contamination status of each pallet to the unit operations center.
          (7) Use Table VIII-6 to determine what decontamination actions, if any, are
necessary based on the mission criticality level and hazard category of the contaminated
cargo.

     d.  Use the following detection guidelines when loading and transporting
contaminated cargo:
           (1) Determine the contamination status of the material handling equipment
and the transport vehicles. Determine if the items have measurable amounts of
contamination. Attempt to locate the pockets of contamination. This may entail the use of
a CAM/ICAM to pinpoint the pockets of dirt and grease that may house the agents in liquid
or dusty forms, which the M8 paper does not readily identify.
           (2) Take the following precautions if the transport vehicle is uncontaminated to
keep it clean during the cargo movement process:
              (a) Conduct immediate decontamination on the portions of the material
handling equipment exposed to the cargo pallet or the transport vehicle. Use the M295
decontamination kit or 5 percent chlorine bleach solution to decontaminate.
                (b) Place plastic or another barrier material in the bed of the transport
vehicle over the area where the cargo pallets will sit.
                    (c)       Replace the outer layer of barrier material on the cargo pallets (if
necessary).
                (d) Ensure that the transport vehicle operator is the only person in the
transport vehicle and that he wears the appropriate level of IPE.
                 (e) Ensure that the local cargo handlers perform the actual cargo loading.
The cargo handlers should not touch, stand on, or go inside the vehicle unless absolutely
necessary. If it is necessary, they should use the decontamination troughs containing 5
percent chlorine solutions to decontaminate their gloves and boots before making contact.
               (f) Check the clean the transport vehicle for evidence of cross
contamination, and if contaminated, conduct an immediate decontamination.

               (g) Seal the vehicle chocks or other transport vehicle accessories that may
have come in contact with contaminated surfaces inside a plastic bag prior to loading.
                (h) Mark the vehicle and the cargo to clearly identify the hazard
associated with the contaminated cargo.
           (3) Use the following guidelines when loading and transporting clean cargo
after attacks with CB agents:
              (a) Determine the contamination status of the material handling
equipment and the transport vehicles.
                (b) Take the following precautions if the material handling equipment or
transport vehicle is contaminated to prevent them from cross-contaminating the cargo
pallet during the cargo movement process:
              •    Conduct immediate decontamination on the portions of the material
handling equipment that will come in contact with the cargo pallet.
                 •    Place at least two sheets of plastic or another layer of barrier material
in the bed of the transport vehicle over the area that the cargo pallets will sit on.
               •    Ensure that the pallets have at least a double wrap of barrier
material. The transport vehicle operator should be the only person in the transport vehicle,
and he must wear the appropriate level of IPE.
                •     Ensure that the local cargo handlers perform the actual cargo loading.
The cargo handlers should not touch, stand on, or go inside the vehicle or vehicles unless
absolutely necessary. If necessary, they should use the decontamination troughs containing
5 percent chlorine solutions to decontaminate their gloves and boots after making contact.
               •     Check the pallets for evidence of cross-contamination, and if
contamination is present, immediately decontaminate.
                 •     Appropriately mark the vehicle to clearly identify the associated
hazard.
          (4) The cargo movement personnel should accomplish the following actions
when receiving contaminated cargo from another location:
                 (a)   Acquire the available information concerning the cargo. This includes
the following:
                 •     A description of the cargo.
                 •     A description of the suspected contamination on the cargo.
                 •     The physical condition of the cargo.
                •    The time of the estimated cargo contamination in relation to the
anticipated reception time at the installation.
                 •     The status of the vehicle operators.
                 •     Contact information for the CBRN specialists and the unit expecting
delivery.
                 (b) If the cargo does not have a high mission priority (as stated by the
receiving unit), assess the ability of the unit or cargo handlers to isolate the cargo upon


4 April 2006              FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60           VIII-27
reception. If choosing the isolation option, clearly cordon off the area surrounding the
pallets. Use a cordon radius of 25 feet (or as directed by CBRN personnel).
                 (c) If the personnel must expediently use the contaminated cargo to
facilitate the mission operations, the receiving unit or cargo handlers should take the
following actions:
             •    Ensure that the reception personnel are in the appropriate MOPP
(normally MOPP4).
                •    Remove the layers of the barrier material (if present), cargo nets, or
pallet banding; and dispose of these items as contaminated waste.
                •    Verify the type and level of the contamination (for example, VX in
liquid form on metal boxes with no measurable vapor hazard).
                 •    Remove the specific cargo from its packaging configuration (if
feasible), and dispose of the packing material as contaminated waste.
                 •   Accomplish the appropriate decontamination activities based on the
extent of the contamination, agent present, cargo surface, and time available.
                •   Mark the contaminated cargo appropriately so that work center
personnel will immediately recognize the potential residual hazard.
      e.   Use the following decontamination guidelines for aircraft pallets:
           (1) Determine, report, and annotate the contamination status of each pallet. If
a single sheet of barrier material protected the contaminated assets, remove and replace
the covering. Accomplish this within 6 hours (the sooner the better). Carefully roll the
material so that the contaminated side rolls to the inside, and then dispose of the material
as contaminated waste. If a double or triple sheet of plastic or canvas protected the
contaminated assets, remove the outer layer and replace it as time permits.
           (2) Dispose of the barrier material as contaminated waste in the appropriate
predetermined location. If a barrier material did not protect the contaminated property,
identify the item as contaminated.
           (3) Pay special attention to pallet netting. If the netting was contaminated, it
will most likely be impossible to decontaminate over time. Ensure that the contaminated
wrapping materials are disposed of in a temporary waste disposal area. Routinely transfer
the contaminated waste to the installation contaminated waste disposal site.

                   SHIPBOARD/MARITIME DECONTAMINATION 


1.    Background
     This chapter addresses shipboard CBR decontamination and the decontamination
aspects of CBRN recovery operations. Recovery operations involve those operations in
which military or civilian personnel, equipment, and supplies move from sites off of naval
ships (e.g., ashore or on another vessel into amphibious shipping)
2.    Shipboard Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Decontamination
      Shipboard CBR decontamination requires a well-thought-out plan and organization.
      a.    Shipboard Organization and Manning. The primary advisor to the commanding
officer for CBR decontamination actions is the damage control assistant (DCA). The
damage control organization includes the personnel assigned to damage control repair
stations, standoff detector operators, countermeasure washdown system operators,
ventilation control personnel, on-station monitors, survey teams, decontamination teams,
and personnel decontamination station operators coordinated through the damage control
center (DCC). Medical personnel are integrated into the shipboard chemical, biological, and
radiological defense (CBRD) organization. Shipboard personnel may be required to conduct
CBRD actions with a variety of routinely embarked units, including USN staffs, USN
aviation squadrons and detachments, USMC units, USN special warfare units, EOD
personnel, elements of Naval beach groups (NBGs) assault craft units, USCG law
enforcement detachments, and USA units. Minimum damage control repair station
manning requirements are outlined in NWP 3-20.31. The number of personnel may be
modified by the type of ship. See the commander’s repair party manual (Commander Naval
Surface Forces Instruction [COMNAVSURFORINST] 3541.1) for a particular ship class.
     b.   Shipboard Decontamination Techniques and Procedures. Detailed CBR
decontamination actions are outlined in NWP 3-20.31, NSTM 470, and NSTM 070.
Shipboard CBRD decontamination and contamination control capabilities are focused on
the survivability of the unit and are conducted primarily by the shipboard damage control
organization.
      c.       Shipboard Safety Precautions.
           (1) Countermeasure Wash Down System (CMWDS). For decontamination with
detergents, in the absence of an oxidizer, the contaminants are not chemically neutralized
and remain toxic. The possibility exists that the agent-contaminated water may drain or
flow in such a way that contamination remains on the ship. Decontamination operations
should be planned and conducted so that most of the runoff flows into the sea and that
areas of heavy traffic and sensitive areas are not recontaminated. Care should be taken to
minimize spraying or splashing of the contaminated liquid.

                                           WARNING
                       Aircraft subjected to CMWDS will become deadlined
                       due to corrosion control requirements until
                       emergency reclamation maintenance is performed.


4 April 2006                FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         IX-1
           (2) Protective Clothing. Full chemical protective clothing shall be worn, and
those personnel who might be exposed to contaminated spray should wear wet-weather
gear over the JSLIST. However, wearing wet-weather clothing will dramatically increase
heat stress. This factor shall be taken into consideration when planning the
decontamination efforts.
          (3) Surfaces. No decontaminated surface should be assumed to be completely
free of CBR hazards until suitable tests are negative. Traces of an agent will often remain
trapped in crevices or absorbed into paint even after treatment with an oxidizer.
Weathering will reduce contamination over time.
            (4) Sensitive-Equipment Decontamination. Most shipboard surfaces can be
safely treated with the standard hypochlorite and detergent solution. The solution shall
not, however, be used on aircraft, ordnance material, or electronic instruments because of
the risk of corrosion damage.
           (5) Use of Hypochlorite. Pure, undiluted calcium hypochlorite burns upon
contact with many organic compounds (including petroleum products and some chemical
agents). Calcium hypochlorite powder shall be added to the water before being used in ship
decontamination. The powder shall not be scattered onto shipboard surfaces. See NTRP
3-20.31.470 (NSTM 470) for mixing instructions and NTRP 3-20.31.670 (NSTM 670) for
stowage instructions.
     d.    Decontamination Priorities. Faced with the presence of contamination, the
commander must decide to what degree decontamination is required. The best means of
contamination prevention or control is achieved through the proper use of the CMWDS.
However, aircraft that is exposed to the saltwater spray of the CMWDS will be deadlined
until emergency reclamation maintenance is performed. Pockets of contaminants may
require an operational or thorough decontamination through the use of fire hoses or other
means. Thorough decontamination is extremely labor-intensive. Clearance
decontamination is not technically feasible with onboard assets. Effective preparations for
CBR decontamination operations must include the designation of those areas for which
decontamination is absolutely essential to ensure the mission’s sustainability. The
decontamination of other areas will be deferred, and the crew will “fight dirty” as required.
When the mission permits, the ship should be repositioned to an uncontaminated location.
The need for additional decontamination measures should then be evaluated (natural
weathering may eliminate much of the hazard). All clear should be sounded as soon as
possible to allow a reduction in the MOPP level.
     e.    Decontamination Levels. Decontamination is the primary countermeasure
process supporting sustained operations in CBRN environments. Risk management (RM)
requires that the decisions regarding the level of decontamination be implemented and the
optimum time for such implementation be allowed.
     f.    Decontamination Materials. Decontamination materials consist of installed
systems and shipboard expedients. The installed systems include CMWDS, a fire main
system, decontamination stations, and ventilation control systems. Expedients consist of
readily available shipboard items such as brushes, buckets, bags, swabs, soap, calcium
hypochlorite, and rags (see NSTM 470).
       g.   CBR Decontamination Actions after Attack.




IX-2                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
           (1) Chemical. Ship and personnel decontamination procedures will commence
as soon as possible. In practice, decontamination is any process that eliminates or
substantially reduces the hazards of contaminated surfaces or objects. It includes the
physical removal of an agent by wash down, the chemical destruction or neutralization of
an agent, or weathering.
               (a) Operational Recovery. The restoration of shipboard operations after a
chemical attack will be very labor-intensive. Mission intensity is the primary factor in
determining personnel availability. Specific priorities must be established based on
operational need. As intensity subsides, the priority can shift to more general
decontamination activities.
                 (b) Survey. Once the CW attack has ended and the ship or force is
believed to be clear of the agent cloud, survey or monitoring teams will conduct a survey of
the entire ship. Vital areas such as ventilation intakes must be free of liquid contamination
before commencing purge ship procedures. The contaminated areas must be identified and
isolated.
                 (c) Personnel Protection. Personnel protection will gradually be reduced
as practical, consistent with shipboard CW hazards and the probability of a subsequent
attack. The protective mask is not removed for showering, but is worn until verification
that no vapor hazards exist aboard ship and all clear is announced ship-wide. Personnel
protective measures during decontamination operations are straightforward. Personnel
directly involved in the operations must be masked, wearing CBR IPE and foul-weather
clothing with all closures fully sealed. Personnel downwind of the operation must remain
masked and continue wearing chemical protective clothing.
                 (d) Personnel Decontamination. Personnel CCAs used aboard the ship
are installed or expedient. Installed stations are spaces that by functional design, location,
and installed equipment are designated for personnel decontamination. Expedient stations
are designated spaces in which the use of improvised procedures and equipment is
necessary to meet the practical demands of the situation. It may be necessary to operate
several decontamination stations simultaneously if risk to personnel is deemed greater
than the current operational requirements. It is desirable to have personnel
decontamination facilities capable of processing at least half of the exposed topside
personnel at any given time. Refer to NSTM 470 for a detailed description of the
decontamination area setup and procedures. Refer to NAVAIR 00-80T-121 for the
modifications to standard shipboard contaminated doffing procedures that apply to
aircrews.
                  (e) Surface and Equipment Decontamination. Using the CMWDS and
fire hoses are the countermeasures available for general, overall decontamination of the
ship’s exterior surfaces. Agent depositions remaining after wash down and fire hosing
include absorbed and surface depositions. CW agents absorbed into the paint, deck
coatings, etc., can usually be left to evaporation and the weathering effects of the
environment. Decontamination may still be required after wash down with fire hoses, and
splash or spray of contaminant-bearing water can be a hazard to the decontamination
personnel or to anyone downwind of the hosing operation.
                 (f) Interior Decontamination. In the event that interior decontamination
is required, the standard decontaminant available on USN ships is calcium hypochlorite
mixed with detergent in an aqueous solution. Steaming is an effective alternative means of


4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60               IX-3
decontaminating a ship’s interior; however, it is recommended that this procedure be
conducted at a shipyard. Steaming, which displaces all air from the contaminated
compartment, allows the compartment surfaces to be heated to a maximum temperature of
approximately 212°F. Agent vapor may discharge from a steamed compartment
unchanged, but mixed with the exhaust steam. This could result in a hazard to personnel.
Interior decontamination must include ventilation blowers. Blower vanes and the
surrounding housing can be expected to be heavily contaminated and must be
decontaminated to avoid reevaporation or blow-off hazard to the compartments served.
                (g) Final Recovery. Personnel must take precautions to prevent skin
contact with decontaminated surfaces, because of the possibility of CW agents desorbing
from paint and other coverings. Personnel engaged in decontamination must continue to
maintain the maximum levels of protection. Personnel in well-ventilated spaces do not
require protection after gross decontamination and purging of the residual vapors has
removed vapor hazards. Personnel should exercise caution when working in poorly
ventilated spaces.
            (2) Biological. The decontamination of vital spaces should be accomplished as
soon as possible. It is important to identify the personnel who may have been exposed to
the threat. The available shipboard decontaminants should include calcium hypochlorite,
topical disinfectants, soap and water, and laundry bleach. The objective following an attack
is to ensure that the ship can continue its mission without an excessive risk to the
personnel following an attack. Damage control personnel may need to assist with the
following:
                 (a) Ship Decontamination. Follow the standard decontamination
procedures using an approved method such as steaming, using decontamination solution,
swabbing, and spraying. The DCA must establish a priority list prior to beginning the ship
decontamination and concentrate on vital stations and crew living spaces. Industrial
facilities may be required for the final decontamination process, depending upon the type
and concentration of the agent. After the decontamination is complete and the ship has
exited the affected area, the greatest threat of infection will be from contact with exposed
individuals. Once infected individuals have been identified (a process that could take
several days), they should be isolated from the rest of the crew.
                 (b) Detection. The decontamination of BW agents is complicated by the
fact that portable monitoring equipment is extremely limited. The decontamination may
consist of a general scrub-down, concentrating initially on vital or known areas of
contamination. Areas of known contamination are identified by the observation of BW
agent clouds or the detonation of munitions containing BW agents.
           (3) Radiological. Radiological hazards can last a long time and can range in
severity from instantaneous casualties to a health hazard that is long-term but of no
immediate operational significance. Radiological countermeasures cannot be applied in the
same sequence in all situations. Command consideration of the tactical situation and the
degree of radiological involvement will influence decisions regarding the countermeasures
to be used (when they are used and how long they will remain in effect). When a ship is
under attack, the commander must first defend the ship from the attack. If the attack is
intense, all radiological countermeasures must wait until the requirements for the essential
defense of the ship have subsided.




IX-4                FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
                 (a) Operational Recovery. The operational recovery phase of a major
radiological involvement starts when emergency actions are discontinued. Maintaining the
level of operational capability required to satisfy the existing tactical situation must be the
primary objective of this phase. It also needs to include reducing the radiation hazards and
repairing the damage. This phase extends over the period of time of decreasing shipboard
radiation when vital stations can be operated for limited periods of time without producing
casualties. Ship maneuvering, personnel shelter, crew rotation and reduction, and early
ship decontamination are applicable countermeasures. In this phase, the command may
have to accept some casualties to maintain the required offensive or defensive capability of
the ship. Setting the appropriate material condition to secure the ship is essential. When
ordered, the closure of fittings will never be given priority over the movement of personnel
to sheltered locations. Ventilation ducts, boilers, and air passages should also be checked
for the accumulation of contaminants. The contamination of saltwater systems does not
present an immediate hazard.
                (b) Personnel Decontamination. The adequate decontamination of
personnel can be accomplished using decontamination stations, designated washrooms, or
showers. Personnel decontamination stations should be located within the ship to afford
personnel the best shielding from radiation. The detection of contaminated personnel with
a radiac meter is difficult when the intensity of penetrating radiation from other sources is
high.
                  (c) Ship Decontamination. The DCA shall develop a decontamination
prioritization list for the vital watch stations. Hosing and manual scrubbing are the most
effective decontamination measures suitable for use at sea. Saltwater is the basic material
for decontamination of a ship at sea. The institution of decontamination procedures will
commence after fallout has ceased and when the tactical and radiological situations permit.
A monitoring team shall make a rapid survey of selected topside locations and report the
results to aid in the decision to order decontamination.
                 (d) Final Recovery. The final recovery phase of a major radiological
involvement starts after the intensity of radiation has dropped to a level that no longer
presents a radiological threat. Minimizing the long-term hazard to the health of the crew is
the objective of this phase. Shipboard decontamination and contamination control are
applicable measures. The time of cessation can be determined from the plot of intensity
versus the time readings plotted by the DCC. When the readings continue to decrease at a
steady rate, the assumption can be made that fallout has ceased. When the topside
radiation levels are below 5 rads/hour, the period of operationally significant radiological
involvement is concluded.
3.   Recovery Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination
     Recovery operations are principally intended for the expeditionary strike group (ESG)
commanders, amphibious squadron commanders, landing force commanders, embarked
units, and staffs performing the recovery operations. When tailored, these principles can
also be applied by any size Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) (e.g., a single-ship
MAGTF or an expeditionary strike force or amphibious task force) or by ships responding to
a CBRN attack. See Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Recovery Operations in a
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Environment for detailed
information on CBRN recovery operations.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60               IX-5
     Recovery operations encompass those operations in which military forces and civilian
personnel (to include casualties), equipment, and supplies move from naval ships (e.g.,
ashore or on another vessel) onto amphibious shipping. These operations may include—
       •    Preplanned amphibious withdrawal of forces subsequent to operations ashore.
       •    Noncombatant or other evacuations.
       •    Recovery of personnel and equipment.
    •    Movement of forces and equipment from shore-to-sea as part of ongoing tactical,
humanitarian, or logistical operations.
      •    Operations undertaken to investigate the nature of materials being transported
on a vessel at sea using a ship’s boarding party or specialized landing force team.
      This section addresses the decontamination procedures required to support
retrograding forces, to include their equipment, DOD essential civilians and contractors,
and civilians under the protection of an expeditionary force. Paramount to the discussions
of recovery operations in a CBRN environment is an understanding that these operations
will place extreme demands on a ship’s freshwater system to support the effort.
Accordingly, commanders at all levels shall institute procedures to conserve water and
order that excess water be stored in advance of known or suspected CBRN operations. In
completing the requirements for decontaminating personnel and equipment, commanders
are not authorized to alter a ship’s basic design to reconfigure a space or create accesses;
conversely, they may modify the use of a space (e.g., establish an isolation ward).
       a.   Procedures.
            (1)   Decontamination Procedures.
                 (a) Decontamination procedures are generally personnel- and
labor-intensive operations. They are largely dependent upon the use of chemical solutions
to rid surfaces of contaminants and upon time to complete weathering or decay in order to
achieve a state of cleanliness that enables the personnel to perform their assigned duties
without the added burden of wearing IPE. The amount of space available to complete the
procedures will generally be determined by the class of ship. Commanders of cruisers,
destroyers, frigates, and smaller-sized ships should anticipate using their flight deck or
fantail areas to support decontamination procedures.
                (b) A solution of calcium hypochlorite, detergent, or other soap is used in
scrubbing and swabbing. Normally, a 9 percent solution in seawater is used, but a 3 or 5
percent solution can be mixed if calcium hypochlorite is in short supply. Directions for
mixing solutions of various strengths are provided in Table 470-7-2 of NSTM 470. If
calcium hypochlorite is unavailable, laundry bleach can be used as a substitute. The
pattern of swabbing is top to bottom, front to back. The minimum amount of
decontamination solution that will adequately cleanse the area should be used. Brisk
rubbing and scrubbing should be used to mix the agent thoroughly with the oxidizer so that
chemical neutralization can proceed more quickly. After an area is scrubbed and swabbed
with the calcium hypochlorite solution or a detergent solution, the area shall be rinsed with
seawater or freshwater while continuing to scrub and swab as necessary to remove any
residue.




IX-6                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         4 April 2006
                                        CAUTION
                  Attention must be given when mixing the solution. The
                  tendency is to make a 10 percent solution. Above 9
                  percent, the solution becomes caustic and it can
                  degrade or destroy equipment and materials. Calcium
                  hypochlorite is not recommended for use on aircraft.



                 (c) If calcium hypochlorite is not available and detergent must be used
alone, scrubbing and swabbing will only result in the physical removal of the agent, not
detoxification. The detergent assists in bringing the agent into solution. The resulting
solution contains toxic agents and shall be washed overboard by fire hosing. In areas where
fire hosing is not possible, rinse the area with buckets of clean freshwater or seawater and
scrub and swab as necessary to remove the toxic solutions.
                   (d) Harsh detergents and oxidizers cannot be used to decontaminate
electronic systems and aircraft without risking damage to the equipment. Instead, only the
materials normally used in maintenance and corrosion control on such systems and aircraft
shall be used. Care shall be exercised to avoid contact with the runoff or other residue as
the toxic properties of the agent are not changed by physical removal methods. The residue
or runoff is still toxic.
           (2)   Decontamination Coordination.
                (a) Forces who are retrograding to a ship or directing the movement of
contaminated personnel and equipment to a ship shall attempt to reduce the extent of
contamination to the lowest possible amount (consistent with the threat and nature of the
operation) before embarking the ship. They shall also make every effort to inform and
update the receiving platform of the nature of any known or suspected contamination and
the degree of decontamination procedures performed.
                 (b) Commanding officers support and assist in the decontamination of
ground forces by ensuring that suitable locations, equipment, and properly trained
decontamination teams are on station. Furthermore, they are ultimately responsible for
ensuring that recovered personnel have completed the required decontamination
procedures before allowing them access to interior spaces. They have the authority to
decide what equipment shall be discarded; however, they will coordinate with the
commander of troops and the commanders of carrier air wings (CAW), MAGTF, and
MAGTF air combat elements (ACEs) to determine the final disposition of recovered landing
force vehicles, aircraft, supplies, and equipment.
                 (c) If the ship is basically clear of contaminants, only the flight deck or
well deck are contaminated, and operations must continue, the commanders will work front
to back in clearing the hazard and establish a pool of decontaminated craft to assume
transport duties for the unaffected personnel and equipment. In some instances, it may be
advisable to transfer the unaffected or decontaminated craft to a clean ship to maintain the
ability to move both unaffected and contaminated personnel and equipment. In order to
minimize the need to repeat decontamination procedures, as long as a need exists to move
contaminated personnel, then contaminated or previously contaminated craft will be used
to move these individuals and their equipment.



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            IX-7
           (3) CCA. The establishment of CCAs is critical to the effectiveness of any
decontamination effort. The CCA serves as the focal and initial entry point for any effort to
bring personnel into the interior of the ship. In well decks, the CCA should be set up as far
back as possible, to include on the stern gate if sea states permit and the effort is to support
personnel returning in combat rubber raiding craft (CRRCs) or like craft. Similarly, CCAs
that are established in hangar bays should be positioned as near an elevator as possible.
Containment pits should be set out to capture contaminated water, which will help reduce
decontamination efforts that will be required for the deck. The collected water is drained
through fire hoses rigged to discharge overboard.
NOTE: Since the hoses will become contaminated and require disposal, ships
should maintain a pool of old fire hoses that can be expended under such
circumstances.
            (4) Decontamination Showers. Aside from the obvious advantage showers
afford for removing contaminants from personnel, showers provide two added benefits.
They give cooling to individuals suffering from the effects of heat stress and they offer a
psychological boost from the feeling of removing the contamination. After showering,
personnel should be advised to keep previously exposed portions of their body uncovered as
long as possible since clothing will block or reduce the weathering effect. Additionally,
wearing clothing on previously exposed skin can drive any residue further into the skin.
Ships have the following five basic options for providing showers for personnel:
                (a) Established Decontamination Showers. Showers offer the best facility
to complete personal decontamination. The ship’s decontamination teams can monitor
personnel through view ports, and contaminated personnel can be guided in completing the
required procedures. However, their location within the ship is not always conducive to
providing returning forces an area close to their entry point onto the ship or the CCA,
which can lead to increased chances for spreading contaminants or offer challenges for
providing safety.
                  (b) Locally Manufactured Showers. Locally manufactured showers offer
the flexibility to meet the design variations within classes of ships, assist in overcoming
shortfalls in decontamination station locations and quantities, and complement locally
developed plans to process individuals with varying needs. They are dependent upon an
undefined quantity of stock material that may or may not be available on the ship to
complete such a structure (e.g., spare shower heads, various sized piping and fittings,
flexible hose, and fabric to cover the structure to create some semblance of privacy and
control the contaminated water residue/spray). Accordingly, locally manufactured showers
should be planned in advance. Efforts should be made prior to deploying or entering a
CBRN-contaminated area to procure the needed supplies so that multiple units are
manufactured and contingency operations are properly supported.
                 (c) Portable Shower Tents. Portable shower tents offer flexibility for
decontaminating a large force or group of civilians. Easy to erect, these portable and self-
contained units include all the piping and wastewater containment capability required to
complement a CCA. Ships would need to rig a source of freshwater or saltwater and a
drainage hose over the side. Consider if the water should be heated and how to heat it if no
access to hot, freshwater exists.
                 (d) Field Showers from Embarked Units. Field showers, designed and
utilized by forces ashore, offer yet another option to meet the challenge of decontaminating


IX-8                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            4 April 2006
a large number of personnel. This equipment would most likely be sent to the field in
support of the landing force or naval support elements and would be an essential part of the
effort to complete their decontamination prior to retrograding to the ship. The ship’s use of
such equipment would require that an MOU be established in advance of such operations.
                (e) Fire Hoses. Rigging fire hoses to create a makeshift shower could
serve as a minimal resource for providing a shower to retrograding personnel. Like the
field and portable showers, some consideration would have to be made for heating the
water. Likewise, personnel manning such stations could be jeopardized by experiencing
hypothermia or increased incidences of dehydration and heat stress from wearing
wet-weather gear to protect their CBRN suits.
           (5) Wash and Gear-Removal Stations. Ships may rig any number of CCAs to
enable personnel to ready themselves for being certified safe for entering the interior of the
ship. Stations will range from areas where individuals can initially attempt to
decontaminate their personal gear and small arms, or to areas that serve as a collection
point for these items, to ultimately providing sites where they can doff their IPE before
proceeding to the shower. If a ship establishes a CCA in the well deck or the hangar bay
and does not have a portable decontamination shower or a locally manufactured shower in
close proximity, a process shall be adopted for moving personnel from the CCA to the
shower wherein the personnel are afforded some measure of privacy (e.g., ships can rig
screening curtains along the route or provide individuals with disposable garments). The
principal decontamination solution for personal gear and equipment will be calcium
hypochlorite. Calcium hypochlorite solutions and the synonymous HTH solution are
prepared in accordance with NSTM 470 by personnel wearing facial shielding, aprons,
rubber gloves, and CBR protective gear. Additional guidance for the construction of shuffle
pits (boot wash), mask lens wash, scissors wash, etc. is provided within Recovery Operations
in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Environment.

                                           CAUTION
                         Do not use saltwater for the mask lens wash
                         because it may scratch the mask lens.


            (6) Shipboard Decontamination of Personnel. The decontamination of
retrograding personnel shall follow the established procedures for decontaminating
shipboard personnel. Personnel shall be routed to a CCA where the initial decontamination
procedures are conducted. Upon completion of the tasks directed at the CCA, personnel
shall be routed to a decontamination shower facility. Contaminated personnel should be
given step-by-step procedures, read aloud to them where possible, by members of the ship’s
decontamination station teams. For situations in which escort ships within an ESG or
carrier strike group (CSG) are tasked to receive contaminated personnel, ships shall follow
the established procedures (see NTSM 470) consistent with decontaminating scrubber or
survey teams. However, in order to support the embarkation, it is necessary to establish a
CCA in the vicinity of the fantail, for personnel retrograding by small craft; or in the
vicinity of the flight deck, if the movement is by helicopter. Personnel will not retrograde to
a submarine.
          (7) Casualty Treatment/Patient Decontamination. As with shore forces,
casualty decontamination should be performed separately from noncasualty



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              IX-9
decontamination. A medical staging area or mass casualty area should be placed near the
decontamination area, but far enough away so that personnel will not be affected by any
contaminant. Refer to NTTP 3-20.31, NSTM 470 and FM 4-02.7.
           (8) Decontamination of Other Forces/Special Decontamination Personnel.
Some modifications to the shipboard personnel decontamination process may be necessary
to accommodate the differences between shipboard protective clothing and equipment and
the corresponding items used by other organizations. Shipboard decontamination station
personnel need to be aware of the differences. Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection describes Army protective
clothing and equipment that may also be worn by USMC and USN beachmasters and
construction personnel. The following items differ from the shipboard counterparts as
indicated:
          •     The BDO is a two-piece ensemble with slide fastener closures used by
ground forces. It cannot be decontaminated. The newer JSLIST suit is similar.
          •  The USA M-40 series masks are worn by ground forces with a hood that
extends downward over the shoulders. The hood is not part of the overgarment.
         •      Green or black vinyl overshoes are used with the BDO. They are worn over
combat boots for chemical protection and can be decontaminated and recovered.
           •    The USA has a suit, contamination avoidance, liquid protection (SCALP)
that may be worn over the BDO for up to 1 hour for protection from gross liquid
decontamination. The SCALP is a lightweight, disposable suit consisting of a jacket,
trousers, and footwear covers.
            •     USA aircrew members may wear the aircrew uniform integrated for the
battlefield, a two-piece uniform with hook-and-pile closures. In addition to providing CBRN
protection, it also provides flame protection; it replaces the standard flight suit and the
BDO.
          •     The chemical protective gloves used by these personnel are similar to the
shipboard item.
The features that differentiate the protective equipment and ALSS used by USN and
USMC aircrews are specifically detailed in NAVAIR 00-80T-121 and include the following:
          •     The A/P22-14 (V) 1-4 aircrew respirators are designed to be compatible with
the standard aircrew helmet.
            •     Blown, filtered air is provided to the mask by a battery-powered pusher fan
that is affixed to a C2/C2A1 canister. The pusher fan/canister assembly resides in a pocket
attached to the crewman’s survival vest or CBR overvest. CBR respirators used by
fixed-wing aviators have a second filter canister that connects to the aircraft oxygen
systems.
          •    The aircrew CPU consists of an undershirt and trousers. The fabric is
composed of a nonwoven material with encapsulated carbon in a stretchable matrix. It is
worn under the flight suit. The set can be washed once and reused if it is not contaminated.
This undergarment cannot be decontaminated.
           •    A disposable plastic cape can be worn over the flight suit for protection
from liquid agents.


IX-10               FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60           4 April 2006
          •     Chemical protective socks are worn under standard aircrew flight boots;
disposable plastic overboots may be worn over the flight boots.
            •    The chemical protective gloves worn by aircrew personnel are of three
varieties, two of which are similar to the shipboard item. The third is made of a gore-type
material. Nomex™ flyers gloves are worn over the chemical protective gloves.

                                      WARNING
                     Operational decontamination procedures for
                     contaminated ground force personnel are not
                     adequate to allow them entry into the ship.
                     Personnel must complete the thorough
                     decontamination procedures before being
                     permitted to enter the interior spaces.


       b.   Flight Deck Operations. Aviation operations in a contaminated environment
create challenges for a ship’s aviation department. The aviation department head and
commanding officer of an embarking aviation unit shall establish MOUs during
predeployment to set policies for such contingencies. They must also arrange for frequent
training to attain mission-essential task list standards will be necessary. Plans must be
developed for conducting extended flight operations, thus necessitating a possible
requirement for additional personnel trained to support flight deck operations. General
statements such as “personnel are not transported after dark” will be negated by
operational and tactical requirements, and such approval can be granted by the MAGTF
commander. One option to meeting these challenges may be to reduce the number of
aircraft operated, with a corresponding reduction in the number of flight deck spots used.
Still, supervisors will need to anticipate a requirement for additional flight deck colored
shirts, additional vests, an increase in the amount of IPE, and foul-weather gear. Some
items may be capable of being laundered, but personnel may be required to don
contaminated equipment over their IPE in the interest of following recognized safety
procedures and to limit the contamination of clean equipment. Recovery operations will
require considerable space to support the collection, separation, weathering, and off-gassing
of equipment, weapons, flight deck jerseys, float coats, ordnance, etc. Likewise, depending
upon environmental conditions, added restrictions may be enacted that limit work periods
to correspond with the heat stress work restrictions.




4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             IX-11
                                             WARNING
          Commands shall not attempt to minimize contamination to aircraft by
          stationing personnel with energized fire hoses on the flight deck and
          directing the aircraft to hover or pass through a “wall of water,” even if it is
          only freshwater that is streamed toward the aircraft. The combination of
          rotor wash and the potential for aircraft ingesting water into the air intakes
          or damage by too strong a stream of water striking the aircraft present too
          great a risk for personal injury or damage to the aircraft.


Because flight operations are normally conducted when winds are off the bow, commanding
officers should endeavor to maintain a wind off the starboard bow to reduce the area
potentially contaminated by a CBRN hazard. Ships should anticipate using their
high-reach equipment and cranes as part of the plan to detect and clean contaminated
areas. The use of the mechanical deck scrubber is not recommended because of its ability to
be decontaminated is highly suspect.
            (1) Moving Aircrews. Because decontaminating the interior of aircraft is
difficult, care must be exercised when moving pilots and aircrew from the interior of the
ship to their aircraft to avoid contaminating the exterior of their individual protective suits
or boots. This can be accomplished through the use of temporary boot covers and the
assistance of the flight deck support personnel. Personnel must remain mindful that
contaminants can be kicked up by jet exhaust and helicopter rotor wash. Flight crews
disembarking from their aircraft will be processed in a manner that is consistent with the
procedures used for troops moving from the aircraft.
           (2)   Moving Troops.
                  (a) Members of the combat cargo division or flight deck crew will guide
retrograding forces from helicopters to the appropriate CCA. If possible, personnel will
remain in the helicopter until the rotor blades have ceased turning. Once the blades have
stopped turning, personnel will be led in a single file to the designated CCA. If rotor blades
must remain engaged, personnel will be directed to move as expeditiously as possible to
clear the helicopter while being led to the appropriate CCA (maintaining a single file). The
use of lights or other markers should be used to identify the path personnel should attempt
to remain within.
                 (b) For personnel departing the ship on a clean helicopter in a
contaminated environment, there is a similar concern as for the aircrew. The outside of the
helicopter may be contaminated upon landing on the ship. These personnel would
generally have to be encapsulated in their IPE before they could move from the ship’s
interior to embark their assigned helicopter. Ideally, it would be helpful if these troops
could cross the contaminated flight deck and board their externally contaminated helicopter
without contaminating their boots or suits. This would in turn require the use of temporary
coverings for their boots as they crossed the contaminated deck. The use of large numbers
of temporary boot coverings raises concerns about foreign object damage (FOD) to the
engines. For this reason, loading might also need to be done prior to the engine startup,
giving time to recover stray boot covers. Alternatively, troops could walk across the deck
contaminating their boots and then don temporary boot covers as they enter the transport




IX-12                FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                 4 April 2006
helicopters. This would leave the boots of the vertical assault troops contaminated, which
is less than ideal, but would use the temporary covers to protect the floor of the helicopter.
                (c) It would be best to protect the troops and the transport helicopter
from becoming contaminated. This may require that a pathway be decontaminated on the
deck from catwalks to helicopter spotting areas if the temporary boot covers are not used.
Still another option to consider is the use of a plastic covering to line the floor of the
helicopter. Again, completing such an action will require regard for FOD and a review of
all requirements.
            (3) Loading and Unloading Aviation Ordnance on Aircraft. Aviation ordnance
and ammunition is treated similar to personnel with cargo with regard for minimizing the
spread of contaminants. Returned munitions should not be stored in ship’s magazines until
certified as decontaminated.
           (4)   Aircraft Decontamination.
                 (a) If air and ground crews are careful when operating in a contaminated
environment, cross contamination from the exterior to the interior can be minimized.
In-flight airflow over the aircraft’s smooth skin at typical flight speeds facilitates a higher
rate of evaporation. Still, some agents will migrate into crevices, rivet heads, and joints
and continue to be a hazard. A common area of contamination will also be on the aircraft’s
tires. Thickened agents evaporate slowly and may remain a hazard even after prolonged
flights.
                 (b) If the interior is determined to be contaminated, flying the aircraft
with the doors open can help reduce the hazard. Procedures for decontamination of naval
aircraft, aircrews and aviation support personnel are provided in NAVAIR 00-80T-121.
Information on emergency reclamation requirements can be found in Aircraft Weapons
Systems Cleaning and Corrosion Control and Organizational/Unit Intermediate
Maintenance for Avionics Cleaning and Corrosion Prevention/Control.

                                        CAUTION
                    Ships are cautioned that improperly sealed flight
                    deck lighting can contribute to contaminants
                    seeping into the interior spaces of the ship.


              (c) If time is available and flight operations are secured, aircraft should
be moved forward to a wash-down spot consisting of a containment pit and a
decontamination team.
NOTE: Ships should try to maintain at least one landing spot of separation
between the recovery landing spots and the wash-down sites.

                                         CAUTION
                     Do not use steam to decontaminate an aircraft.
                     Damage to the composite materials used in the
                     construction of aircraft may result.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              IX-13
                 (d) An aircraft wash down (i.e., operational decontamination) should be
conducted within 6 hours of becoming contaminated, but it is most effective when conducted
within 1 hour. Some amount of chemical contamination may remain after the aircraft wash
down. The aircrew shall continue to wear their protective masks and rubber gloves for
protection until a thorough decontamination is conducted or until the aircraft has
weathered and the contamination is below detectable levels.

                                            CAUTION
                          Most of the field-expedient decontaminants
                          are corrosive and could cause damage to
                          aircraft materials.


                (e) While it is possible to perform a thorough decontamination of
individual aircraft, this can be a tedious and time-consuming activity that will require a
considerable amount of manpower to accomplish.
       c.   Well Deck Operations. The requirements for well deck and small boat operations
in a CBRN environment are similar in nature to those of flight deck crews. The ship’s first
lieutenant and DCA, working in conjunction with the ships combat cargo officer, coordinate
policies for manning requirements and decontamination procedures with the embarked
element commanders. Once such operations are directed to occur, the DCA and the ship’s
first lieutenant brief the assigned personnel on the plan of action for the survey and
decontamination procedures, recovery of equipment and personnel, and any offload
requirements. All well deck personnel will require IPE consistent with the threat and their
duties. Once cleared to disembark their craft, personnel will be led to a CCA to initiate
decontamination procedures. Craftmasters shall be advised to maintain loads that were
wet during transit to the ship if contamination is known or suspected to exist. It is the
responsibility of the craftmasters, coxswains and drivers to keep the CBRN defense cell and
well deck control officer advised of the craft’s contamination condition. Depending on a
variety of factors (e.g., tactical situation, sea state, and craft capabilities) craftmasters,
coxswains, and drivers will attempt to decontaminate any known hot spots prior to
recovery. They shall also attempt to complete a survey to verify that the decontamination
is complete. If the craft is unable to be given a wash down, personnel may be brought into
the ship and soaked using the ship’s firefighting sprinklers with the aqueous film-forming
foam (AFFF) secured. Similarly, the craft can be positioned in close proximity to the ship’s
quarter and sprayed by personnel with saltwater fire hoses. Once this is completed, a
report to the ship shall be made citing that the craft is ready to enter the well. If the
environmental conditions permit, and if the procedures exist and can be authorized, a stern
gate or sill marriage is preferred. If the sea state conditions do not permit or if a final
recovery of the craft is expected, the craft should be brought in using the steepest possible
wedge and then be grounded out. All crafts and loads will be rinsed from top to bottom,
front to back. Following the decontamination operations and when the landing craft can be
directed to exit the well, the ship will flood the well deck to further eliminate any hazards.
For the amphibious transport dock (LPD-4) class of ships, energizing the water curtain can
be used to isolate the vehicle storage area from the landing craft air cushion (LCAC) to
spray and rinse the loads. The recovery and decontamination procedures described in the
following paragraphs will be completed for the craft (as applicable).

           (1)   LCAC.
                 (a) The craftmasters shall maneuver their craft to maximize the exposure
to sea spray. Propeller reversal, with the craft proceeding downwind and across the wind,
is recommended as a minimum. If the craftmaster’s survey confirms that the craft is clean,
direct the craft to proceed into the well. Conversely, if the craft is still contaminated and
the tactical situation and sea state permit, direct the LCAC to go off-cushion astern or
alongside the ship. Have the ship’s well deck crew hose down the craft with saltwater from
the stern or catwalks; avoid hitting the LCAC propellers with a solid stream of water.

                                            WARNING
                    Spraying water into the moving propellers could produce
                    catastrophic blade failures presenting hazards to
                    personnel. Spraying solid streams of water at stopped
                    propeller blades could result in damage to the propellers
                    and should be avoided.

                (b) If the LCAC is still contaminated and the operational situation
permits, bring the LCAC in using the emergency recovery rig and spot it as far behind as
possible to reduce the likelihood of spreading the contamination within the well deck. With
the crew and troops remaining within the craft, well deck teams will survey the LCAC and
decontaminate the hot spots. If the LCAC went over land to recover or deliver its load,
contaminants will have been absorbed into permeable material, presenting a long-lasting
contact and vapor hazard. At-risk material includes nonskid coverings and the rubber
skirt; a thorough decontamination will likely result in their removal and replacement. It is
possible that the emergency recovery line might become contaminated through contact with
the craft. Following the last evolution, discard the line over the side, ensuring that it does
not create a hazard to navigation. If a replacement line is not available, cut off the affected
portions and reconstruct the line’s features as necessary.
                 (c) When bringing a contaminated LCAC into the well deck, every effort
should be taken to clear the well deck and wing walls of all porous materials (e.g., lines, fire
hoses). Porous materials exposed to the contamination should be jettisoned. Personnel who
are exposed to LCAC-generated wind and spray shall don their JSLIST and wet-weather
gear. All well deck and vehicle storage supply ventilation shall be turned on high speed, all
exhaust ventilation shall be secured, and all vent exhaust intake covers shall be covered to
ensure that air is forced toward the rear part of the ship and exits through the stern gate
opening. When sea state and weather permit, it may be necessary to deviate from the
ship’s normal recovery ballast condition in order to minimize the spraying action of the
contamination throughout the well deck and wing walls. In such cases, it will then be
necessary to complete an emergency recovery of the LCAC using the towing rig with the
propellers secured. Ballast the ship to the steepest wedge possible, with the water level at
the sill to a minimum of 5 feet. Recover and shut down the LCAC engines. Activate the
well deck sprinkler system with the AFFF in the recirculating mode, and operate the
system for 2 minutes to wash down any contaminated spray from the craft. Fire hose main
pressure should be at the maximum, and all nozzles should be operational to ensure the
complete designed coverage. The survey and decontamination teams will then conduct
established checks and cleaning procedures that are consistent with the ship’s CBRN
defense bill.



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              IX-15
            (2) Landing Craft, Utility (LCU). The LCU initiates active decontamination
during transit to the ship, including activation of its CMWDS. Upon nearing the ship, the
LCU should be directed to take and maintain its station alongside the ship at the slowest
and safest possible speed. Once alongside, the ship’s force uses additional fire hoses from
the catwalks to concentrate on those areas not fully covered by the LCU system. The LCU
crew is then directed to survey their exterior and report results to the ship; any hot spots
will be further decontaminated. If agents have been left on the craft for over an hour, the
epoxy-based paint may have absorbed them and a thorough decontamination may be
required. The ship’s force and LCU crews should pay particular attention to the crew cabin
ventilation, air conditioning systems, and the large filter units for the engine air intake
system. The crew cabin ventilation system can create a serious vapor hazard by blowing
the agent vapor into an otherwise sealed compartment. When retrieving an LCU, a stern
gate or sill marriage is preferred to minimize the contamination of the ship. Alternatively,
bring the LCU in and ground it out without fully deballasting. With the ramp down, the
ship’s survey team checks the craft for any residual agents and, working with the craft
crew, completes the decontamination. Direct disembarking personnel to proceed to the
CCA to commence personal decontamination and to receive medical attention (if required).
Complete the decontamination of the craft while the well is deballasted, flushing out the
well deck in the process.
NOTE: There is a possibility that the steadying lines will be contaminated.
Following the last evolution, discard the lines over the side, ensuring that they do
not become a hazard to navigation. If replacement lines are not available, cut off
the section which came in contact with the craft and resplice the line’s eye.
            (3) Amphibious assault vehicles (AAVs) essentially complete an external
decontamination as a function of their transit to the ship. To further decontaminate the
craft, position the personnel in the vicinity of the stern and direct them to hose down the
AAV with saltwater prior to signaling it to enter the well. Once in the well, keep the
hatches closed, with the crew and troops still inside, stop the AAV in the center of the well,
and hose it down again with saltwater from fire hoses on both wing walls. Turn the AAV
180 degrees, and hose it again before backing it into a parked position. Keep the planking
wet before and during recovery to avoid or reduce the likelihood of the agent saturating the
wood. The AAV platoon commander will initiate the internal decontamination procedures.
After a survey and the additional decontamination, permit the crew and troops to exit the
vehicle, directing them to the CCA to complete their decontamination and medical
assistance before allowing them into the interior of the ship. Setting “Circle William“
hinders the ship’s ability to ventilate the heavy AAV fumes from some well decks and could
contribute to a buildup of fumes in the well deck and contribute to reduced visibility.
         (4) Landing Craft, Mechanized (LCM). The procedures are the same as for an
LCU, except the craft has no CMWDS and does not use a stern gate or sill marriage.
            (5) CRRC. Contaminated CRRCs should be recovered one at a time. When
environmental conditions permit, the CRRCs and their crews should remain in the rear
section of the well deck during their survey and decontamination. The decontamination
team uses portable showers for the crews. Once an initial rinsing has been completed, the
personnel are directed to proceed to the CCA for decontamination and medical attention (if
required).




IX-16               FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60           4 April 2006
            (6) Other Small Craft. For davit-hoisted small craft (e.g., motor whaleboats,
rigid hull inflatable boats), call the craft alongside for the initial decontamination by the
shipboard fire hose teams; take care not to injure the personnel or swamp the boat. Once
the craft is at the rail, the personnel disembark, are surveyed, and are directed to the CCA
for decontamination and first aid (if required). The craft receives a thorough survey and
decontamination prior to being hoisted aboard and secured. If a determination cannot be
made that the craft is decontaminated, and if weather permits, it may be left at the rail
until further decontamination can be accomplished. The eyes on all of the steadying lines
and the sea painter will be dipped into an HTH solution and then cut off and disposed of
over the side; new eyes on the lines will be made.
     d.    Vehicle and Equipment Decontamination Procedures.
            (1) Ships generally lack sufficient equipment to conduct a thorough
decontamination of vehicles; specifically, they do not carry wash racks to facilitate easy
access to the undercarriage of the vehicles. Any effort to embark the contaminated vehicles
and cargo into previously uncontaminated amphibious shipping requires a thorough review
of all the options available to complete the assigned mission (to include a review of the
follow-on mission responsibilities). If the ESG has the option to consolidate the clean cargo
and vehicles before loading the contaminated items, such a course of action shall be
pursued. If wash ramps are not available, ships with a “false beach” offer the best option
for receiving the contaminated vehicles (e.g., LPDs, amphibious assault ships [general
purpose and multipurpose, and cargo variant landing ship docks [LSDs]).
           (2) In order to accomplish the cleaning, ships should ballast, create a steep
wedge, and avoid submerging the false beach. When sea state and wave action in the well
deck permit, create a 3- to 5-foot basin of water in the well deck, attach fording gear to the
vehicles, and slowly drive them for 5 to 10 minutes in the saltwater. Spray with fire hoses,
and use scrubbing teams (as necessary) to decontaminate the unsubmerged areas. Once
the vehicle is determined to be free of contaminants, it will be directed to move further up
on the false beach and receive a freshwater wash down to minimize corrosion potential.
Finally, maintenance personnel should perform the post-saltwater emersion maintenance
tasks.
           (3) Steam cleaning may be considered as an option for decontaminating
vehicles and cargo, but such evolutions are likely to be extremely dangerous and difficult to
accomplish. Steam lancing can produce injuries similar to surgical incisions and the risks
may far outweigh the potential gains that might be made over attempting to complete the
decontamination procedure by creating a pool of water as described above.
     e.    Force Reconstitution.
           (1) Reconstitution is generally beyond the capabilities of an ESG. However,
reconstituting and expeditiously returning the force to a full mission readiness standard is
the ultimate goal of any decontamination effort. In some instances this will not be possible
until a considerable period of time has elapsed (e.g., following a nuclear warfare attack).
Should the force be unable to restore itself to a full operational-readiness standard,
assistance from outside commands or agencies will be sought, to include replacing
contaminated personnel and equipment with assets obtained from the rear area commands.
Similarly, in situations where the forces are being maneuvered (i.e., transported) from one
landing force objective to another, forces may only be capable of accomplishing a limited
operational decontamination. If the forces are unable to complete a thorough


4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             IX-17
decontamination, the commanders will make every effort to ensure that personnel are
afforded the maximum level of support in assuring their comfort. For example, landing
forces may be required to remain in the well deck or sequestered on the flight deck, but
every effort will be made to afford them with adequate shelter and meals. Commanders
may likewise find it more practical to take advantage of consolidating the forces along the
lines of their levels of contamination and have one or more of the ships serve as
contaminated ships and the remainder as clean ships, thus modifying the landing plan to
align with the modified force disposition.
           (2) The commanders may reduce the protective postures and allow the
unprotected military personnel, DOD essential civilians, and contractors to operate in the
proximity of the formerly contaminated material or equipment. This reduction can be made
after using the currently fielded and available technologies to validate that the
decontamination procedures or weathering have reduced the hazards from material and
equipment to nondetectable levels. The commanders will ensure that the equipment and
personnel are periodically monitored to determine if signs of a return of the contamination
are detected. Should a hazard be identified, commanders will direct that appropriate action
be taken to safeguard affected personnel.

                                            WARNING
                     Risks to personnel safety increase as residually
                     contaminated equipment is consolidated and
                     personnel work around this equipment for
                     prolonged periods, particularly in areas with
                     limited air circulation.


           (3) Before initiating the action to recover potentially contaminated equipment
to the CONUS for repair, the commanders should coordinate with the JRA coordinator to
determine if an emergency condition exists and warrants the risks associated with such an
action. Generally, the equipment will not be returned to CONUS until it has been
determined to be clear of contamination, even if such an action results in the requirement
for an extended period of time for weathering. If the equipment cannot be decontaminated,
destruction may be required.

                                               CAUTION
                     Civil aircraft will not normally be used to transport the
                     contaminated equipment due to the safety and legal
                     concerns.

               PATIENT EVACUATION AND DECONTAMINATION


1.   Background

      a.   The evacuation of patients under CBRN conditions forces the unit commander to
consider how he will commit evacuation assets to enter the contaminated area. Generally,
if a supported force is operating in a contaminated area, most or all of the medical
evacuation assets will operate there also. Efforts should be made to keep some ambulances
and aircraft free of contamination. See FM 4-02-7 and FM 8-10.6 for additional
information.

     b.    On the modern battlefield, land forces have three basic modes of evacuating
patients (personnel, ground vehicles, and aircraft). Watercrafts may also be used to
conduct patient evacuation for waterborne forces (see MCRP 4-11.1E).

     c.    Cumbersome MOPP gear, climate, increased workloads, and fatigue will greatly
reduce the effectiveness of the unit personnel. Using the personnel to physically carry
patients incurs a great deal of inherent stress.

      d.   The evacuation of patients must continue even under CBRN conditions. The
medical leader must recognize the constraints that CBRN contamination places on him and
then plan and train to overcome them. These constraints include the need for the allocation
of dirty evacuation vehicles, patient transfer processes from dirty to clean vehicles, the
allocation of personnel and supply resources for PDS operations, and the restricted working
conditions of medical personnel wearing MOPP in ambulances with patients who have not
been thoroughly decontaminated.

     e.   When evacuating patients in a CBRN contaminated environment, evacuation
considerations should include the following:

          (1) Evacuation assets could become contaminated in the course of battle.
Optimize the use of contaminated medical and nonmedical resources before employing
uncontaminated resources.

           (2) Once a vehicle enters a contaminated area, it is highly unlikely that it can
be spared long enough to undergo decontamination. This will depend upon the
contaminant, the tempo of the battle, and the resources available for patient evacuation.
Normally, the contaminated vehicles (air, water, and ground) will be confined to
contaminated environments. However, immediate decontamination may be accomplished
to reduce the amount of contamination in the patient transport area.

           (3) Ground ambulances or other assets that are easy to decontaminate and
readily replace should be used versus using air ambulances. However, this does not




4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60               X-1
preclude the use of aircraft in a contaminated environment or the evacuation of
contaminated patients.

           (4) If evacuation personnel are sent into radiologically contaminated areas,
adhere to the operational exposure guide (OEG). Radiation exposure records must be
maintained by the supported unit and made available to the commander, staff, and medical
leader. Based on the OEG, the commander (with the assistance of his medical staff), will
decide which evacuation elements are sent into the contaminated environment.

           (5) The relative positions of the contaminated area, FLOT, threat air defense
systems, and the patient’s medical condition will determine if and where air ambulances
may be used in the evacuation process with minimal air crew exposure. One or more air
ambulances may be restricted to the contaminated areas. When possible, use ground
vehicles to cross the line separating the contaminated and clean areas.

           (6) Patients should receive immediate and patient decontamination at the
operational level and first aid and buddy care prior to being placed on evacuation vehicles.
To reduce the spread of contamination on ground ambulance wheels for vehicles that have
been in the contaminated area, a contamination control line can be established at the edge
of the contaminated area where patients can be transferred from the dirty ambulances to
clean ambulances that do not contain contamination on their wheels. The clean medical
evacuation vehicles would then proceed to a PDS at an MTF. The patients have not been
given patient decontamination at the thorough level at this point. The inside of these clean
vehicles may become contaminated if patients are not provided with immediate
decontamination of their MOPP uniforms to remove most of the contamination. This
necessitates that all ambulance crew members wear MOPP while in the field vehicles to
protect them from possible cross contamination or vapor hazards from agent on patient
MOPP. Another alternative is to determine the specific routes that will be used by dirty
medical evacuation vehicles to get to the PDS at an MTF. The routes used by the dirty
ground vehicles to cross between contaminated and clean areas are considered dirty routes
and are not crossed by clean vehicles. See FM 4-02.7 for the setup of a PDS at an MTF.

           (7) When employing ground ambulances, watercraft, or aircraft in a medical
evacuation, place plastic sheeting under the litters to prevent transferring contaminants
from the patients or litters to the inside of the vehicle. The plastic sheeting can be removed
with the patients, thus removing most of the contamination with it. When plastic sheeting
is not available, placing a blanket under the litter will reduce the amount of agent that
makes contact with the inside of the vehicle.

           (8) The rotor wash of the helicopter or turbulence (e.g., prop blast) from wing
aircraft must always be kept in mind when evacuating patients, especially in a
contaminated environment. The intense winds may disturb contaminants, increasing
vapor hazards at the contaminated landing site. The effects of downwash may be reduced
by allowing the helicopter to land and reduce to flat pitch before patients are brought near
it. Additionally, a helicopter must not land too close to a PDS that is open to the air as it
can disturb dust and contaminants that may be in the area. If the PDS operation is in an
uncontaminated area and contains contaminated runoff (such as in a bladder to hold
contaminated waste), downwash should not be an issue at the PDS.




X-2                  FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
           (9) Casualty protection during an evacuation is critical. Casualties who have
been thoroughly decontaminated at a forward MTF and have had their MOPP ensemble
removed must be placed in a patient protective wrap (PPW) or have their MOPP ensemble
replaced if they are to be transported on a dirty aircraft, watercraft, or ground vehicle or
when they are moved across a contaminated area.

           (10) Medical evacuation by a fixed-wing aircraft will be severely limited as these
assets are few compared with rotor wing and ground ambulance, and they require
significant time to decontaminate. Some nations may not allow casualties from
contaminated areas to travel through or over their territory. Every effort should be made
to thoroughly decontaminate the casualty by removing the contaminated clothing and
thoroughly washing the patient at an MTF PDS prior to the casualty reaching the staging
area. The patient must undergo a thorough decontamination before entering a fixed-wing
aircraft that is designated as clean.

     f.   Operational decontamination of medical evacuation assets should be
accomplished to minimize crew exposure if the mission permits. The unit SOP should
include equipment decontamination procedures.

2.   Patient Decontamination

     a.    Contaminated patients potentially create increased hazards to casualty
extraction teams, HSS personnel, MTFs, and materiel. Detailed information on patient
decontamination is found in FM 4-02.7. This section provides an overview of patient
decontamination for the individual services.

     b.   Personnel who have undergone a CBRN attack may suffer from the effects of a
CBRN agent, TIM exposure, a conventional wound, psychological stress reactions, or a
combination of these. In addition, some personnel may suffer from heat injuries induced by
extended time spent in MOPP4.

    c.   Patient decontamination supports the decontamination process at the
immediate, operational, and thorough levels.

      d.    The process of patient decontamination begins at the incident site. The
contaminated service member performs immediate personal decontamination. If the
service member is unable to decontaminate himself due to injury or incapacitation, a buddy
performs this function. The contaminated areas on the MOPP ensemble and the exposed
skin are decontaminated. For liquid chemical contamination, the M291 SDK is useful. If
the M291 SDK is not available, use soap and water or a field-expedient absorbent material
(such as clean, dry earth), ensuring that the skin is not abraded during its use. For vapor
and aerosol contamination, use soap and water. Immediate decontamination is critical to
limit the injury to the contaminated individual. For biological contamination, soap and
water will remove these agents, but may not kill all of them. Radioactive contamination
can also be removed (but not neutralized) with water or soap and water, by simply brushing
dust and debris from the clothing and hair, or vacuuming with a vacuum that is fitted with
a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             X-3
      e.   Every attempt must be made to limit the spread of contaminants onto the
medical evacuation vehicles. As much contamination as possible must be removed from the
patient’s MOPP prior to loading him on the evacuation assets to reduce the contamination
of these assets and the cross contamination of the other patients and crew. Individuals who
are transported to the MTF for care may or may not be contaminated. If feasible,
uncontaminated patients should be protected from cross contamination. Ways to reduce
cross contamination include the following:

      •   Designating areas for the contaminated patients on the ambulance.

      •   Placing the contaminated patients on plastic sheets in the vehicle.

     •     Identifying separate assets for dirty and clean patients who are transported from
the battlefield in MOPP.

     •     Decontaminating the MOPP of all patients who come from the dirty evacuation
assets (ensuring that the MOPP gear is adequately decontaminated reduces cross
contamination inside the dirty vehicle).

     f.  The key in patient decontamination at the thorough level is that the proper
decontamination procedures must be followed to limit the spread of contamination so that
MTFs and other patients are not compromised through the incapacitation of medical staff
who are wearing CBRN protective equipment.

     g.    Each service follows slightly different procedures for thorough patient
decontamination (based on the service’s mission and equipment). All services follow similar
principles, which include the following:

          (1) Medical personnel supervise the patient decontamination operations.
Augmentees from the supported units are usually required to assist in the decontamination
process and perform patient lifting and washing.

            (2) In the triage area outside the PDS, further decontamination of MOPP is
performed to limit the spread of contamination (while necessary medical care is provided to
stabilize the patient).

            (3) Medical triage officers sort patients, considering the priorities for
treatment, decontamination, and evacuation, based on the patient’s need for care and his
ability to benefit from what is available at that MTF.

           (4) Those who do not require lifesaving procedures at a smaller MTF may
remain in their MOPP4 ensemble on the dirty side of the hot line. There, the patient will
be given patient operational decontamination and medical stabilization and returned to
duty or evacuated to a larger in-theater MTF (where there is adequate staff to provide
patient thorough decontamination to larger numbers of patients).

           (5) Patient decontamination at the thorough level is a comprehensive cleaning
process that must be carried out prior to a patient being allowed inside any MTF. It
involves removing all of the patient’s MOPP and any underclothing that is suspected of



X-4                  FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         4 April 2006
being contaminated. Typically, all of the patient’s clothing is removed. The patient’s skin
is then decontaminated. When water resources are limited, only the patient’s mask and
those areas of suspected skin contamination are decontaminated (pay particular attention
to areas where there were breaks in the protective clothing and around wounds). The M291
and soap and water are used for chemical contamination. However, a 0.5 percent
hypochlorite solution is useful if water is limited and the M291 kits are not available. Soap
and water are best for biological and radiological contamination. For all agents, a complete
body wash, using soap and water, can be performed (if adequate resources are available).

         (6) Medical care and triage are provided before, during, and after patient
decontamination to ensure that the patient remains stable enough to survive the procedure.

           (7)   Open wounds are irrigated with clean water or saline.

            (8) The least desired alternative for skin decontamination is hypochlorite
solution. If used, only a 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution is used for patient
decontamination. Higher concentrations will irritate and burn the skin and allow some
nerve agents to enter the skin more rapidly. During patient decontamination at the
thorough level, the only place where 5 percent hypochlorite (full strength liquid bleach)
solution is used is to decontaminate plastic mesh litters that are designed to be
decontaminated. The litters are rinsed before reuse. The litter washing process is
performed away from the patient decontamination area.

           (9) All patients who arrive at the PDS wearing protective masks will remain in
their masks during the decontamination process and until they are out of the PDS vapor
hazard area. Medical personnel may remove the patient’s protective mask to intubate the
patient. The resuscitation device, individual, chemical (RDIC) is used if there is a vapor
hazard in the area of treatment.

         (10) Patients who are treated outside the MTF should not have their MOPP
removed as long as they do not enter the MTF or a clean area or do not require skin
decontamination.

           (11) Contaminated bandages and splints are only removed by trained medical
personnel. The bandages are removed; the skin is decontaminated and only replaced if
bleeding continues. Splints are not removed during the decontamination process; cravat
and other strapping material may be removed one item at a time, the skin decontaminated
and a new cravat placed on the splint. Repeat this process until the entire splint has been
decontaminated.

3.   Army Patient Decontamination Procedures

       a.   The Army is a land-based mobile force, which uses patient decontamination
procedures that meet the mission demands. Decontamination equipment is simple, is easy
to relocate and set up, can be used in a limited water environment, and takes up relatively
little storage space.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             X-5
     b.    Each MTF, from Level I to larger, has a patient decontamination medical
equipment set. Larger facilities, such as Levels III and IV, have more equipment and staff
to handle larger numbers of patients evacuated to them from smaller, forward MTFs.

     c.   Smaller, battalion level MTFs are not staffed to perform patient thorough
decontamination and medical treatment. Therefore, patient thorough decontamination
must be performed by nonmedical personnel from the supported units or units located
within the base cluster or in vicinity of the MTF. These individuals are supervised by the
medical personnel. The minimum number of personnel required for basic PDS operation is
16. Larger MTFs will require greater numbers of personnel as they will need to process
greater numbers of patients. Also, additional personnel should be considered to allow for a
work-rest rotation of workers. Personnel are split into two categories. The two categories
are:

     •     Nonmedically trained augmentees to assist with ambulatory decontamination
and litter decontamination.

     •     Medically trained personnel serve as medics at the triage area, dirty side
emergency medical treatment (EMT) areas, litter and ambulatory decontamination areas,
clean side of the hot line, and clean treatment area.

      d.   If the MTFs are located near the troop decontamination units, coordination can
be made to colocate medical patient decontamination and nonmedical troop
decontamination side by side to share assets. Brigade is the lowest level that this operation
can be effectively planned. However, decontamination support for other unique operational
organizations (e.g., SOF) may require execution at a lower level. The operation requires
close coordination between the brigade chemical officer, brigade S-4, brigade surgeon, and
medical company commander.

       e.   Army patient thorough decontamination involves decontamination procedures
for litter and ambulatory patients. This encompasses a series of specific steps for patient
medical stabilization, the removal of clothing, wash down, and mask removal before entry
into the MTF. Army field decontamination equipment sets provide buckets, sponges, liquid
soap, HTH for a shuffle pit and hypochlorite solution preparation, litters, and litter stands.

     f.   Detailed step-by-step instructions for the operation of the Army PDS are found
in FM 4-02.7.

4.    Marine Corps Patient Decontamination Procedures

      a.  The Marine Corps is an amphibious mobile force that can conduct patient
thorough decontamination operations on a ship, according to the Navy shipboard
procedures, or on land with procedures similar to those used by the Army. It uses patient
decontamination procedures at the thorough level that meet the mission demands.
Decontamination equipment is simple, is easy to relocate and set up, can be used in a
limited water environment, and takes up relatively little storage space.

     b.   The Navy MTFs supporting the Marine Corps are not staffed to perform patient
thorough decontamination and provide medical treatment. Therefore, the patient thorough



X-6                  FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
decontamination must be performed by nonmedical personnel from the supported units or
units located within the base cluster or in vicinity of the MTF. These individuals are
supervised by the Navy medical personnel. The minimum number of nonmedical personnel
required for a Level I battalion aid station for patient thorough decontamination is identical
to the requirements for the Army. The requirements include personnel to assist with
ambulatory decontamination, litter decontamination, and hot line management. Navy
medical personal minimal requirements would include medics at the triage area, dirty side
EMT area, litter and ambulatory decontamination areas, and the hot line. Levels II and
larger will require greater numbers of personnel as they will need to process greater
numbers of patients at larger Navy medical facilities supporting Marine Corps units. In
these cases, additional manpower will be needed to ensure appropriate manpower
work-rest rotation.

      c.    The Marine Corps land-based patient thorough decontamination involves
decontamination procedures for litter and ambulatory patients. This encompasses a series
of specific steps for patient medical stabilization, the removal of clothing, wash down, and
mask removal before entry into the MTF. The equipment and procedures are almost
identical to those of the Army, with minor differences in the cutting of clothing procedures
for patients.

     d.   Detailed, step-by-step instructions for the operation of the Marine Corps
land-based PDS are found in FM 4-02.7.

5.   Navy Patient Decontamination Procedures

      a.   The Navy is primarily a sea-based force that can conduct patient thorough
decontamination operations on a ship (according to Navy shipboard procedures) or on land
for land-based Navy MTFs.

      b.   Ship-based procedures are unique to the Navy due to the architecture and layout
of the ship. Contaminated litter casualties are typically triaged, stabilized, and
decontaminated above deck and then brought below deck for treatment after they are
decontaminated. Some ships may contain decontamination stations built within the ship
where patients can be processed below deck.

     c.    Patient thorough decontamination procedures for land-based Navy MTFs are
similar to those of the Army, depending on the decontamination equipment available.

      d.   Detailed, step-by-step instructions for the operation of the Navy land-based PDS
are found in FM 4-02.7.

6.   Air Force Patient Decontamination Procedures

      The USAF is deployed as a land-based force that projects air power from a stationary
site that may become contaminated. USAF patient thorough decontamination procedures
are for deployed and CONUS forces in two separate configurations.

     a.  In deployed environments, the USAF utilizes expeditionary medical
decontamination teams (EMDTs). These teams, with equipment and procedures, meet the



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              X-7
mission demands for a stationary land support force that must sustain operations in a
contaminated environment. Patient thorough decontamination is designed to allow the
force to continue limited operations in an environment that becomes contaminated. Patient
decontamination equipment is packaged to be air-transportable, ergonomically designed for
optimal manning, and rugged for sustained use. USAF patient decontamination assets are
only deployed with a chemically protected deployable medical system (CPDEMEDS) 25-bed
medical package or larger. Decontamination equipment includes a Small-Shelter,
Personnel Decontamination System (SSPDS), which is composed of tentage, a water
bladder, a litter roller system, water heaters for handheld soap and water sprayers, and a
runoff wastewater collection system. The SSPDS has lanes for both litter and ambulatory
patients. Environmental control units regulate the temperature inside the SSPDS and
maintain positive air pressure through access doors to the outside so that the unit can
operate with contamination outside. The environmental control units also include air locks
to the CPDEMEDS MTF. The 19-person manpower detail, which makes up one EMDT, is
primarily composed of medical personnel who train together and perform all the
decontamination procedures and medical care involved in the patient decontamination
process. One EMDT can simultaneously process an average of 15 ambulatory and 15
nonambulatory casualties per hour. Detailed step-by-step instructions for the operation of
the EMDT are found in AFI 10-204, with supplemental information found in FM 4-02.7.

      b.    Within CONUS, the USAF uses an in-place patient decontamination capability
(IPPDC). This is a nondeployable asset that is designed to provide patient thorough
decontamination at USAF MTFs. It is designed for patients who self-present or are
transported for definitive medical care to the MTF and may have bypassed
decontamination at the incident scene. Equipment includes a decontamination tent that
can be readily deployed. The entire tent setup includes plumbing, with soap and water
sprayers, to decontaminate both litter and ambulatory patients and a roller system for
litter patients. It also has water heaters and a runoff water collection system. The
plumbing must be connected to a fire hydrant or an outside faucet. The IPPDC
decontamination team is typically composed of 12 medical personnel who train as a group.
Detailed, step-by-step instructions for the operation of the IPPDC are found in AFI 10-204,
with supplemental information found in FM 4-02.7. Many CONUS MTFs have similar
nondeployable patient decontamination layouts.

                                          Chapter XI 

     DECONTAMINATION IN SUPPORT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 


1.   Background
     a.    During every incident involving a CBRN release, there is a possibility that the
target could be a military installation, unit, or activity or a civilian site. The targets could
include critical infrastructures or members of the public. The DOD maintains significant
decontamination resources (personnel, equipment, and supplies) that may be used to
support a request for federal assistance. Additionally, service decontamination resources
may likely be used to respond to an incident or accident at a military installation. This
chapter will briefly address how DOD decontamination capabilities could be provided to
support HLS. Additionally, this chapter will address decontamination terms, procedures,
and planning considerations that could be applicable to an incident or accident supporting
HLS.
      b.    To prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major
disasters, and other emergencies, the United States Government (USG) has established a
comprehensive approach to domestic incident management. The objective of the USG is to
ensure that all levels of the government have the capability to work efficiently and
effectively together. In order for the government to accomplish this mission it developed
the Federal Response Plan and later the NRP.
     c.   For additional information refer to Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Aspects of Consequence Management.
2.   Federal Assistance
     Providing decontamination assistance to non-DOD government organizations requires
detailed coordination.
      a.   Local and state governments routinely respond to a wide array of domestic
emergencies without any federal assistance. Some CBRN incidents may not overwhelm
local response capabilities, but may require technical advice and assistance that is not
readily available in local or state agencies. However, a large-scale incident may overwhelm
local and state responders, requiring considerable federal assistance.
     b.    Requests for assistance (RFAs) from civil authorities are coordinated through the
processes outlined in the NRP. If local or state authorities submit an RFA, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) develops a mission assignment and tasks the
appropriate primary agency. If the tasked primary agency needs additional assistance, it
may request military support through the on-scene defense coordinating officer or the
Secretary of Defense (SecDef). The military elements capable of providing the necessary
response are then sent to the incident area under the operational control of the defense
coordinating officer (DCO) or JTF (during a CBRN incident) to perform the tasks.
       c.      Under DODD 3025-1, imminently serious conditions resulting from a civil
emergency or attack may require immediate action by military commanders or by
responsible officials of other DOD agencies to save lives, prevent human suffering, mitigate
great property damage, or limit the spread of contamination.

3.  Response to a Homeland Security Incident—Decontamination
Considerations
     There are important differences between a HAZMAT incident and a CBRN incident.
Responders must be aware of these differences and take the proper precautions for self-
protection, protection of other responders, and protection of the public during response
actions. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and
Chemical Aspects of Consequence Management for decontamination considerations that
apply to consequence management operations.
       a.   General Considerations.
            (1) With most CBRN material, responders must complete decontamination
swiftly in order to save lives and minimize the number of victims. Although a rapid
response is required because of the speed that many of the toxic chemical agents affect the
body, responders must resist rushing in to assist until the situation is over.
           (2) The number of expected victims is the first major difference between a
standard HAZMAT situation and a CBRN incident. Responders may be required to control,
triage, decontaminate, and track a large number of people at the site of a CBRN incident.
Scene control may involve a large area, a mass victim situation with numerous responders
who want to help, and the press corps seeking information about the incident. A response
of this magnitude will require more personnel and material than may be available;
therefore, detailed contingency planning, training, and exercising is required in advance.
          (3) A terrorist CBRN incident is a federal crime scene. During the
decontamination process, responders must make every effort to preserve evidence for
eventual use in apprehending and prosecuting the perpetrators.
           (4) Runoff control is required to reduce the spread of the hazard. Because of its
potential toxicity, keep decontamination runoff away from sewer drains, groundwater,
streams, and watershed areas. If runoff cannot be controlled, notify the appropriate
agencies (e.g., sewer, water, and environmental).
     b.    Purposes of Decontamination. The potential for exponentially increasing panic
and cross contamination after a CBRN release is staggering. Responders who are called
upon to assist in the decontamination process must possess the ability to execute the
decontamination procedures properly; thus, negating the exponential effects and enhancing
victim confidence.
       c.   Decontamination Levels.
           (1) Emergency decontamination can occur at any point during a
decontamination operation. Like mass decontamination, it commonly refers to procedures
taken for the rapid reduction of agent from the skin. However, when an emergency arises
during the decontamination process (e.g., the responder runs out of air during a technical
decontamination), quick steps must be taken to alleviate or mitigate the emergency while
also practicing contamination avoidance.
          (2) Mass decontamination is a commonly used term referring to the rapid
reduction of agent from the skin of many contaminated victims. Mass decontamination is
performed as quickly as possible while also practicing contamination avoidance. Other




XI-2                FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         4 April 2006
terms associated with the mass decontamination process are emergency, gross, and
immediate decontamination.
           (3)   Technical decontamination commonly refers to the deliberate
decontamination of responders, equipment, and evidence. Technical decontamination can
also be performed on a mass contaminated populous if conditions allow. Technical
decontamination is performed with the emphasis on neutralization of the agent. Speed is
not a factor. Terms that are commonly associated with technical decontamination are
detailed, thorough, deliberate, definitive, and responder decontamination.
     d.    Decontamination Planning Considerations.
           (1) Mass decontamination can take many improvised forms, with the intent
being the rapid removal of the agent.
               (a) Government agencies (e.g., OSHA) recommend a high-volume,
low-pressure water system as the default standard for mass decontamination.
               (b) High-pressure water systems are discouraged because they may force
contaminants through the clothing and increase contamination on the victim.
               (c) Field-expedient methods, like the ladder-pipe decontamination system
method developed by the Howard County Fire Department for the Baltimore Exercise
(BALTEX) V (an emergency response demonstration in Baltimore, Maryland), proved that a
multiple-apparatus platform allows responders to create a longer corridor for
decontamination that will accommodate a large number of victims.
                (d) Commercially available decontamination systems are effective, but
most of these systems are trailer-mounted and require transportation to the incident site,
causing delays. However, if these systems are centrally located and rapidly deployable,
they offer an advantage over other systems because they provide the following:
                •    Heated showers.
                •    Cover.
                •    Systems to control runoff.
                (e) The use of chlorinated swimming pools, elevated master nozzles, fog
streams, and public-school shower facilities are other improvised methods that meet the
intent of emergency decontamination. The objective is the rapid and gross removal of most
of the agent involved in the incident.
           (2) Emergency decontamination does not require the use of a decontamination
corridor, although the nature of the corridor lends itself to an organized and effective
decontamination operation.
           (3) Weather conditions and the possible requirement of an indoor
decontamination site (e.g., school gym with showers, car wash, or community center) are
things to keep in mind when choosing a location. Techniques for adjusting water pressure
may also come into play when using hose lines and elevated master streams in the
decontamination process.
          (4) Appropriate personal coverings are provided for persons undergoing
decontamination, using items readily available from the local area, such as disposable
ponchos, coveralls, and salvage covers. Incident logistics coordinators or responders might



4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            XI-3
procure blankets, large towels, sheets, and tablecloths from local restaurants, stores,
hospitals, and hotels. Consider providing overhead cover to afford additional consideration
for modesty.
            (5) Establishing a triage, treatment, and transport area in a clean and secure
location that is large enough to accommodate all victims must also be considered. Ensure
that all responders are aware of the signs and symptoms of CBRN exposure. The use of
mechanical ventilation and pharmaceuticals may be required to stabilize victims.
           (6) Decontaminated victims and responders must be treated and transported to
supporting MTFs immediately following the decontamination. Consider mass transit, when
available, to assist in transporting victims.
       e.   Safety of Responders.
            (1) The safety of responders is of the utmost importance. All responders with
the potential to encounter contaminated victims or be exposed to contaminated material
must wear protective clothing and respiratory protection equal to or one level below the
level of protection required for the hazard. Responders can assure maximum consideration
for the safety of themselves and victims by instituting and following safety procedures. The
following are the levels of protection given in Department of Labor (DOL) Regulation 29
CFR 1910-120:
                 (a)    Level A.
                •     Positive pressure, full face piece, self-contained breathing apparatus
(SCBA) or positive pressure-supplied air respirator with escape SCBA approved by the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
                 •      Totally encapsulating chemical-protective suit.
                 •      Coveralls (optional).
                 •      Long underwear (optional).
                 •      Gloves, outer and inner, chemical-resistant.
                 •      Boots, chemical-resistant, steel toe and shank.
                 •      Hard hat (under suit) (optional).
               •    Disposable protective suit, gloves and boots (depending on suit
construction, may be worn over totally encapsulating suit).
                 (b)    Level B.
                •     Positive pressure, full face piece SCBA or positive pressure-supplied
air respirator with escape SCBA (NIOSH-approved).
                 •    Hooded chemical-resistant clothing (overalls and long-sleeved jacket,
coveralls, one- or two-piece chemical-splash suit, disposable chemical-resistant overalls).
                 •      Coveralls (optional).
                 •      Gloves, outer and inner, chemical-resistant.
                 •      Boots, chemical-resistant, steel toe and shank.
                 •      Boot covers, outer, chemical-resistant (disposable) (optional).

                 •     Hard hat (optional).
                 •     Face shield (optional).
                 (c)   Level C.
             •    Full face piece or half mask, air-purifying respirators
(NIOSH-approved).
               •     Hooded chemical-resistant clothing (overalls, two-piece
chemical-splash suit, disposable chemical-resistant overalls).
                 •     Coveralls (optional).
                 •     Gloves, outer and inner, chemical-resistant.
                 •     Boots, chemical-resistant, steel toe and shank (optional).
                 •     Boot covers, outer, chemical-resistant (disposable) (optional).
                 •     Hard hat (optional).
                 •     Escape mask (optional).
                 •     Face shield (optional).
                 (d)   Level D.
                 •     Coveralls.
                 •     Gloves (optional).
                 •     Boots or shoes, chemical-resistant, steel toe and shank.
                 •     Boots, outer, chemical-resistant (disposable) (optional).
                 •     Safety glasses or chemical-splash goggles.
                 •     Hard hat (optional).
                 •     Escape mask (optional).
                 •     Face shield (optional).
           (2) If the agent is unknown, Level B is the minimum required protection.
Military issue IPE (MOPP ensemble) does not meet OSHA Level C requirements. If
wearing MOPP—
           •     Minimize contact with the victims.
           •     Practice contamination avoidance.
           •     Know the agents and the signs and symptoms of their effects.
          •    Institute the universal safety precautions to better protect operations level
responders from blood-borne pathogens.
NOTE: MOPP gear does not provide adequate protection for many TIM.
     f.    Isolation and Organization of Ambulatory Victims.
           (1)   Determine the best ways to isolate victims and establish victim control.




4 April 2006              FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             XI-5
          (2) Explain to victims that they need help. Provide them with instructions
pertaining to what steps need to be taken. This can be done with loudspeakers or public
address systems.
           (3) Evacuate the victims upwind and uphill of the hazard. Separate the
victims who are showing symptoms (symptomatic) from the victims who are not showing
symptoms (asymptomatic). Separate men and women. Collect personal items (e.g., use a
plastic bag and a method of identification, voucher personal articles for later return).
           (4) Provide special consideration to families, small children, the elderly, and
special-needs persons.
       g.   Types of Decontaminants.
          (1) While there are numerous types of decontaminants available for use by
responders, they fall into three basic categories:
                (a) Miscellaneous (Commercial). Available stockpiles of these
decontaminants may be quickly expended and not readily replaceable. Therefore, it is
important that responders have an understanding of other decontaminants, their sources,
and their uses.
               (b) Natural. The use of natural decontaminants will reduce the responder
time and the use of available decontaminants.
                (c) Standard Military. If the military is called in to support the incident,
military decontaminants may be available.
           (2) Decontaminants should be stocked and stored before any incident. They
must be accessible and clearly marked for content. Test decontamination material
routinely for viability (strength). Operations level responder training must stress
decontaminant use, application, and risk (e.g., agent use and contact time for personnel and
equipment).
           (3) When capabilities and resources allow, decontaminants of choice are soap
and water, water, or household bleach if soap and water are limited. Full strength, 5
percent bleach solution from the bottle should only be applied to equipment (15-minute
contact times) and never to skin. It will decontaminate most CB agents. A 5 percent bleach
solution followed by a complete flushing is the maximum bleach concentration used for skin
and clothing (though not exactly matching the recommended percentages, a standard rule
of thumb is 10:1, or 10 parts water to 1 part bleach). Do not apply bleach to a victim’s face.
            (4) Responders may use commercially available materials (such as absorbents)
for the control of liquid contamination at an incident scene and the removal of most gross
chemical contamination from surfaces. Contamination will be transferred to the absorbent
material, which must be treated as contaminated waste and disposed of accordingly. Since
there is no preparation time for absorbent material application, utilize the material as soon
as it arrives at the incident scene.
            (5)   Nonaqueous (without water) methods provide a means for contaminant
removal.
                (a) The use of dry, gelled, or powdered decontaminating materials to
absorb chemical agents is appropriate (if their use is expedient). Commonly available
absorbents include dirt, flour, baking powder, sawdust, charcoal, ashes, activated carbon,


XI-6                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
alumina, silica gels, and clay materials. Although these absorbents may be an expedient
means of decontamination, their effectiveness has not been determined. In general,
absorbents only remove contamination, they do not always neutralize the agent.
                 (b) The DOD uses the M291 and M295 SDKs, which employ a
charcoal-based resin absorbent and are available for commercial purchase. However, while
these kits are effective in removing spots of liquid chemical-agent contamination, they may
not be suitable for treating mass casualties. This is due to their potentially limited
availability and the relatively high labor requirements because of the size of the
decontamination pad and the time it takes to clean large amounts of contamination from
the victim.
          (6) The use of natural degradation and ultraviolet (UV) light does not require
responder preparation or application time. UV light kills most biological agents quickly,
but does not kill spores.
     h.    Decontamination Corridor.
           (1) Responders must be prepared to conduct emergency
decontamination and to set up a decontamination corridor. To do this, select and
secure a large area upwind and uphill of the hot zone. Provide protection for and be
able to accommodate the decontamination of large numbers of victims. Base an
emergency decontamination operation on speed rather than neatness.
            (2) The sooner one begins and completes the decontamination, the
better, as time will be a critical element. The decontamination process also has the
potential of creating a hazard. Notify the proper authorities downstream if
responders cannot confine the runoff to the incident scene. To reduce this hazard,
responders must do the following:
               (a) Control decontamination runoff as best as possible. Know where it is
going, and ensure that it will not flow into clean areas.
             (b) Coordinate with local environmental management officials if possible.
Confinement may be critical if radiological materials are involved.
                   (c) Establish measures for the decontamination of fatalities. One method
is to establish an additional lane within the decontamination corridor. Consider the
psychological implications of the colocation with living victims and the potential need for
autopsies for evidence as factors in determining where to establish the decontamination
facilities for fatalities.
            (3) After establishing the decontamination corridor, responders must
effectively communicate to the victims what action can be expected as they pass through
the corridor during the decontamination process.
               (a) During decontamination, have the victims remove their outer clothing,
down to their undergarments to increase the thoroughness of the decontamination process.
The removal of clothing removes approximately 50 to 80 percent of the contamination.
                (b)   Additionally, consider implementing the following techniques:
                •     Use bags (such as trash bags, biohazard bags, or other bags of suitable
size and strength) to collect and identify the individual clothing removed from the victims.

                  •    Place the bagged clothing into a sealed container (tagged for
identification) for a more thorough inspection later.
                 •    Wet the victims down before removing their individual clothing (if the
hazard is biological or radiological). This will embed the agent on the clothing of the
victims and reduce the potential for the biological or radiological agent to adhere to the
bodies of the victims or becoming reaerosolized.
                •    Blot the agent off (using a pinching motion) to remove the liquid (if the
hazard is a suspected liquid mustard [blister] agent).
       i.   Nonambulatory Emergency Decontamination of Patients.
           (1) Emergency cutout and decontamination of the nonambulatory victims at a
WMD terrorist event presents many challenges to the first responders. Responders must
be able to perform cutout procedures efficiently in order to accommodate the numerous
victims that will need immediate medical attention. Precautions must be taken to prevent
the spread of contamination to the responders, team, victims, and uncontaminated ground.
          (2)     Minimize responder and victim exposure during the decontamination
process by—
           •     Selecting PPE at a level that protects the responder against the threat
(chemical or biological agent). OSHA guidelines state that the PPE level must be at least
one level below the contaminated responder’s protective level. When the agent is unknown,
OSHA requires PPE Level B. However, PPE Level A protection is recommended for
additional safety pending the agent identification.
            •     Wearing positive pressure SCBA.
            •     Limiting the number of responders that come in physical contact with
victims.
            (3)   Consider the following techniques to provide protection when handling
victims:
           •    Use supports to hold the stretchers and backboards off the ground (e.g.,
milk crates or sawhorses).
           •   Keep clothing away from the victim’s face during removal (limits the victim
breathing the agent).
            •     Remove or cut the clothing from head to toe, front to back.
          (4) Do not cut through holes or tears when removing clothing from victims.
These are clues to the event and may prove to be useful evidence.
          (5) Control and monitor all responder’s activities throughout the incident for
accountability and treatment in the event they become contaminated. If responders become
contaminated, they may be required to conduct self-decontamination procedures to assure
their own safety.
       j.   Technical Decontamination.
           (1) When setting up the technical decontamination corridor, establish it away
from the emergency decontamination corridor. During the emergency decontamination
process, the emphasis is on speed and CBR agent removal since the victims have no

protection against the agent. Technical decontamination concentrates more on
completeness and neutralization since the responders are in protective clothing.
           (2) The distance between the stations of the corridor is critical in minimizing
the vapor hazard and cross contamination. The distance is most critical at the last station,
where personnel remove their respiratory protection and move to the cold zone. The
incident commander or HAZMAT technician will establish the distances required between
stations based on the weather conditions, the number of victims, space available, the type of
agent used, and time restraints.

                                       LOGISTICS 



1.   Background
        Many of the materials that are needed to conduct decontamination operations are
identified in this chapter.
2.   Consumption Rates and Replenishment
    Serious consideration must be given to consumption rates and the replenishment of
items in order to sustain decontamination operations and remain prepared.
     a.    Skin Decontamination and Personal Wipe Down. Each warfighter carries his
own SDK. The SDK will be stored in the individual’s mask carrier. The basis of issue per
individual is two SDKs (12 packets). The unit maintains at least one SDK per assigned
person for resupply. Personal wipe down is also done with these kits.
     b.     Individual Gear Decontamination. The standard decontamination kit for
individual gear is the IEDK. Each warfighter carries an IEDK according to procedures
outlined in their unit SOP. The basis of issue per warfighter is one IEDK. Each kit
contains four individual decontamination packets, enough to decontaminate two complete
sets of individual gear.
     c.   Operator Wipe Down. The unit or activity will use the M100 SDS for operator
wipe down. The M100 contains two packs of reactive sorbent powder, two wash mitt type
sorbent applicators, a case, and two straps. It allows two operators to perform simultaneous
decontamination operations.
     d.    MOPP Gear Exchange. Each warfighter wears or carries one complete set of
MOPP gear. The unit or activity will maintain additional sets of MOPP gear as specified in
the service logistics authorization documents. When a unit or activity undergoes a MOPP
gear exchange, the unit sends a supply vehicle with the replacement MOPP gear and any
decontaminants to rendezvous with the contaminated element at the operational
decontamination site. The units or activities will generally maintain a 5 percent overage of
MOPP gear, based on their personnel strength or authorization (whichever is greater) to
ensure that a complete range of sizes and replacement gear is available. All MOPP gear,
serviceable and unserviceable, is handled as organizational clothing and equipment (Class
II supplies). The higher HQ is responsible for resupplying these items.
     e.    Vehicle Wash Down.
           (1) Vehicle wash down is done in the unit or activity AO by the unit
decontamination crew. The crew moves to the operational decontamination site, conducts a
rendezvous with the contaminated element, and conducts the wash down. The vehicle
wash-down crew may use a PDDE to spray 100 to 150 gallons of hot, soapy water on each
vehicle to wash off the gross contamination. For vehicles such as the M1 series armored
fighting vehicles, 200 gallons of water may be required per vehicle. Each 100 gallons of
water provides a two- to three-minute wash. See Chapter IV for planning, coordinating,
and determining the requirements for a vehicle wash down.




4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            XII-1
          (2) A PDDA, such as the M12A1, injects detergent into the water as it
operates. It uses 2.5 quarts of detergent for every 1,200 gallons of water (about 1 quart of
soap per 450 gallons of water).
     f.    DTD. Generally, the units or activities conduct the DTD with the support of the
CSS assets. Materials for this technique must be requested from the supporting CSS
assets. The reconstitution operations should be closely associated with the
decontamination operations. An assessment and recovery team ensures that the material
and equipment are available for the decontamination operation as a part of the
reconstitution effort.
        g.   DED.
           (1) A CBRN unit must have access to a large water source (e.g., rivers, ponds,
or a public water system) to conduct a DED. The CBRN unit leader estimates the amount
of decontaminants that are needed. A CBRN decontamination unit sets up the DED site,
supplies the decontaminants, and conducts the DED. The CBRN decontamination unit
should carry enough decontaminants to service one company or squadron size unit. A
CBRN decontamination unit that is assigned to conduct a DED for approximately 16
vehicles should carry a minimum of 4 gallons of liquid detergent and thirty 50-pound drums
of STB. The CBRN decontamination platoon is usually resupplied through its parent unit.
Command assignment relationships can change the resupply channels. (See Table XII-1 for
the estimated water consumption guidelines for operational decontamination, DED, and
DTD.)

30-gallon container          Varies, see Chapter IV         The initial setup requires approximately 250 gallons of
                                                            water. The water must be changed after 10 personnel
                                                            have been decontaminated through the DTD to avoid the
                                                            transfer of contamination.
                                                            Station 1 (120 gallons, four 30-gallon containers)

3-gallon container                                          Station 7 (12 gallons, four 3-gallon containers)
                                                            Example:
                                                            About 150 personnel are to be decontaminated through
                                                            the DTD. Two hundred-fifty gallons of water will be
                                                            needed for every 10 personnel.
                                                            150 (number of personnel) ÷ 10 (required water change)
                                                            = 15 (the amount of times the water will need to be
                                                            changed)
                                                            15 x 250 (gallons of water for every 10 personnel) =
                                                            3,750 gallons of water for 150 personnel
1
  To reduce contamination, conduct operator spray down before the operational decontamination. This process
  requires less water consumption during a thorough decontamination.
2
  Always include a 10% planning factor to the total estimate of the water consumption for the DED and the DTD.
  Example: 2,250 (gallons of water for the DTD) x 10% = 225 (additional gallons of water). A total of 2,250 + 225 =
  2,475 (gallons of water required for the DTD).
3
  The planner should consider the vehicle predecontamination action to estimate the water consumption. He should
  consider the vehicles that were processed through the operational decontamination because they will normally
  increase the weatherization process and may reduce the water usage.

           (2) See Table XII-2 for the decontamination resources that should be available
at each organizational level for the USA unit decontamination requirements. See Table
XII-3 (page XII-4) for the USA units estimated requirements for the equipment and
supplies that are needed for the decontamination operations. See service logistics and
authorization documents for their allocation of decontamination resources. See Table XII-4

3.   Maintenance Considerations
     The disabled equipment or systems located within a contaminated area should not be
removed for maintenance or returned to the owning organization until after they have been
decontaminated. Minor on-site maintenance of the contaminated equipment or systems
may be necessary. All maintenance that is performed on contaminated or potentially
contaminated equipment and systems must be coordinated with the owning unit
commander and the maintenance unit. If available, decontamination units may assist by
providing site and equipment decontamination for the affected area.

NOTES:
1. The avoirdupois system of weights is used for pounds, ounces, and drams except when specified. The
avoirdupois system is the everyday system of weights commonly used in the United States where 16
ounces = 1 pound and 16 drams = 1 ounce. It is considered more modern and standardized than the
alternative troy or apothecary system.
2. The US gallon is a different size than the UK gallon, so no liquid measures of the same name are the
same size in the US and UK systems.

                                         Appendix B
      TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, 

 RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND TOXIC INDUSTRIAL MATERIAL 

                  DECONTAMINATION 


1.   Background
      This appendix provides basic information on the technical aspects of CBRN weapon
effects and characteristics as it relates to decontamination. It also briefly addresses the
decontamination-related aspects of TIM. Many CBRN and TIM substances are airborne
hazards and may leave some degree of residual contamination that is hazardous to
humans.
2.   Nuclear and Radiological Weapons
     Radioactive material will remain radioactive for some time and forces use removal or
shielding methods to effectively decontaminate.
     a.    Nuclear weapons have an enormous potential for physical damage and residual
contamination. An RDD is a device that causes the dissemination of radioactive material
across an area without a nuclear detonation. An RDD functions by using conventional
explosives to blow up and scatter radioactive debris across a targeted area. This type of
weapon may also cause conventional casualties to become contaminated with radioactive
material and would complicate recovery actions within a contaminated area. Significant
amounts of radioactive material may be deposited on surfaces after the use of a nuclear
weapon or an RDD. Military operations in these contaminated areas will require an
evaluation of the potential hazards and may require protective actions and
decontamination. Operations could result in military personnel receiving radiation
exposure or contact with particulate contamination, which would warrant medical
evaluation and remediation.
      b.    Nuclear radiation is characterized as initial or residual. The initial radiation is
produced within 1 minute of the explosion. Residual radiation, also referred to as delayed
fallout, occurs over a period of time. Fallout is composed of radioactive particles from the
bomb and material from the surface of the earth that is carried into the air by the
explosion. The larger particles return to the earth within 24 hours, but the smaller dust
particles may take several months to fall. Other hazards include the presence of
radioactive material on or in exposed sources, such as food and water.
           (1)   Little or no fallout is generated by a high-altitude burst.
          (2) Little or no fallout is generated by an airburst. While the fireball is still
glowing, a tremendous amount of radioactive energy is released.
           (3) The heaviest amount of fallout from a surface burst occurs within 24 hours
in the immediate area of ground zero (GZ). Lighter fallout, in the form of a radioactive
cloud, creates a residual radiation hazard (or footprint) that can extend hundreds of
kilometers downwind. Table B-1, page B-2, provides representative estimates of the
downwind radiation hazards resulting from different sized nuclear weapon detonations.

These estimates are for planning purposes and are subject to change based upon variables
such as environmental conditions and the height of the weapon detonation.

      c.   The types of ionizing radiation are described below.
           (1) Alpha particles are charged particles that are approximately four times the
mass of a neutron. Because of their size, alpha particles cannot travel far and are stopped
by the dead layers of the skin or by a uniform. Alpha particles are a negligible external
hazard; but when they are emitted from an internalized source, they can cause significant
cellular damage in the region immediately adjacent to their physical location.
           (2) Beta particles are very light-charged particles that are found primarily in
the fallout radiation. These particles can travel a short distance in the tissue. If large
quantities are involved, beta particles can damage the skin and produce a “beta burn” that
can appear similar to a thermal burn.
          (3) Gamma rays, emitted during a nuclear detonation and from the fallout, are
uncharged radiation similar to X-rays. They are highly energetic and pass easily through
most material. Because of their high penetration ability, exposure to a gamma radiation
source can result in a whole-body exposure.

          (4) Neutrons, like gamma rays, are uncharged and are emitted only during a
nuclear detonation; they do not present a fallout hazard. Compared to gamma rays,
neutrons can cause 20 times more damage to the tissue.
     d.   The three principle means to mitigate nuclear weapon effects are time, distance,
and shielding.
           (1) Time. Minimize the exposure times of the personnel conducting the
decontamination. Personnel should remain inside unless directed otherwise through the
chain of command. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear,
Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection for information on radiation exposure guidance.
           (2)   Distance. Maximize the distance from the hazards.
           (3) Shielding. Concentrate efforts to prevent physical contact with the fallout.
As a minimum, wear the appropriate IPE when outside. The standard-issue chemical
protective masks afford protection from the inhalation and ingestion of radioactive
material. Remain within the protected areas or shelters until directed otherwise. Perform
damage assessment, self-aid, and buddy care and report these actions. Decontaminate
when necessary to remove or reduce the contact or long-term exposure hazards from the
fallout particles. The units and activities that are exposed to the initial radiation must first
identify the intensity (dose rate) of the residual or induced radiation using radiac meters.
They will then send the NBC 4 contamination and radiation dose status reports through
the command channels. The commanders identify the units that exceed the OEG. They
decide whether to withdraw these units and conduct decontamination operations or to
continue with the mission. The personnel contaminated by the radioactive dust or debris
perform an immediate decontamination by brushing or wiping their bodies and gear. As
the mission permits, they can further reduce the radiation exposure by occupying armored
vehicles, bunkers, shelters, or buildings. Highly contaminated vehicles and major weapon
systems that pose a hazard undergo operational decontamination. This procedure limits
the spread of the contamination to other areas and reduces radiation hazards. Early
decontamination is necessary to cut down on the cumulative effects of radiation.
3.   Biological Warfare Agents
     There are many factors that determine how to decontaminate BW agents.
      a.   BW agents are pathogens or toxins. Some kill, while others incapacitate; some
act quickly, while others incubate for several weeks; and some are contagious, while others
are not. The pathogens include spore-forming agents (anthrax) that can persist for days in
the environment. See Table B-2, page B-4, for information on the properties of selected
biological agents.

     b.   Knowing how an agent can be disseminated is important to shaping an effective
response. The size, shape, intensity, and overall effectiveness of the agent deposition
pattern are influenced by the delivery method.
         (1) Theater ballistic missiles are a viable means of delivery for many agents
and may cause some contamination depending on the type of agent.
            (2) The size of the submunition pattern allows the area targets to be more
effectively targeted.

         (3) Stationary or vehicle-mounted ground sprayers can be used to deliver
agents. However, the resulting line source can cover a very large area and may cause some
contamination at the point of release for a point source depending on the type of agent.
         (4) As an airborne line source, aircraft sprayers may also yield some
contamination depending on the type of agent.
          (5) In addition to weapons-associated delivery of BW, BW agents can be
disseminated through other means such as fomite spread and food or water contamination.
                (a) Using inanimate objects (fomites) to spread an agent is another
potential way to disseminate a biological agent, such as smallpox.
               (b) Food or other products for human consumption are also a group that is
vulnerable to BW agent contamination.
               (c) Water supplies are a potential means for a biological attack. Some
pathogens can grow and survive in water for a considerable length of time. However, the
amount of agent required to have an operational impact make this a less likely means of
delivery.
      c.   Environmental Factors.
           (1) Environmental factors will dictate the size and shape, dosage at inhalation,
height of the agent deposition, and the concentration of the agent deposition patterns on
the ground.
           (2) The conditions necessary to cause an operationally significant
reaerosolization hazard are not completely understood. The form of the agent at the time of
delivery is significant. Dry anthrax may be deposited over large areas with relatively small
deposition levels on the ground. It is unlikely that reaerosolization of the anthrax from
these depositions will generate an operationally significant hazard.
      d.   Most biological agents are not persistent and will decay within hours or days
with exposure to the environment. However, anthrax spores can survive in a nonvegetative
state for years if embedded just beneath the surface where they would be shielded from UV
radiation, temperature, and humidity effects.
     e.    The DOD biological sampling kit provides a simple presumptive identification
capability for a limited number of biological agents (pathogens and toxins). However, the
user will most likely not know what areas are contaminated. BW agents are generally not
recognizable in the air or on a surface by the human senses.
          (1) Since BW agents are released as small particles and aerosols, they tend to
move with the wind. Stronger winds move the clouds faster, resulting in a lower exposure.
In calm conditions, the agent cloud stays close to the release site.
           (2) A successful attack requires the agent to mix with the air. Stable layers
restrict the vertical movement of the agent particles so that the agent released below an
inversion remains available for inhalation and causes a higher likelihood of exposure.
           (3) Landforms, buildings, and surface coverings (e.g., trees, brush, sand, and
asphalt) influence the channeling of the wind and affect the spatial agent distribution.
          (4) BW agents decay in the atmosphere at different rates based on heat,
humidity, and exposure to UV light. Most BW agents will survive for relatively short



B-6                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
periods of time (minutes to hours) in the open atmosphere. The relatively low rate of
biological decay of anthrax spores makes anthrax an attractive BW agent. Anthrax can
survive between one and two days in the air.
          (5) In a weaponized release, the level of deposition onto ground surfaces is very
low. Agent survival on the surfaces is an important characteristic for considering the risk
from a reaerosolization and the need for decontamination. Anthrax spores and smallpox
virons have been found to be quite stable in soil (for many years).
           (6) The time of day affects the operational impacts of an attack because each
agent biologically decays at a different rate depending on temperature, humidity, and UV
light intensity. In general, night or early morning, with their lower temperatures and UV
light, provides the best conditions for a successful BW agent attack because of the lower
biological decay. During this period, neutral and inversion conditions (especially with low
wind speeds) result in the agent clouds, which maintain lower physical decay (i.e.,
spreading of the biological agent over time).
4.   Chemical Agents
     There are many considerations when determining chemical-agent decontamination.
     a.     Factors such as hazard duration, climactic conditions, the amount and type of
contaminated resources, the number of personnel who physically come in contact with
contamination, and the type of chemical agent affect, postattack recovery, and medical
support activities are all considerations for determining chemical-agent decontamination.
The primary CW agents of concern for decontamination are nerve and blister agents.
Adversaries may seek to increase their effectiveness of chemical agents by employing them,
where possible, under favorable weather conditions. Weather factors that affect
chemical-agent employment include wind speed, air stability, temperature, humidity, and
precipitation.
     b.    Chemical agents can adversely affect personnel through three principle routes of
entry: inhalation, absorption of liquid or solid agent through the skin, and absorption of
vapor through the skin.
     c.    The following are methods an enemy could use to enhance dissemination.
           (1) Chemical agents, such as blister and nerve, have historically been released
in neat liquid form, but can be disseminated in thickened or solid particulate (dusty) form.
Agents disseminated in neat liquid form initiate a hazard cycle wherein the droplets settle
to the ground after detonation, posing a direct contact hazard to people and equipment
while the droplets are airborne. The agent is also beginning to evaporate during the
droplet fall phase, so a vapor hazard starts to emerge. The largest vapor concentrations
and probabilities of cross contamination remain highest while the droplets remain on the
surface. In varying degrees of time, the agent will absorb into all but the most nonporous
surfaces (e.g., glass, unpainted metal). Once this occurs, the agent may still present a
hazard because of the toxic vapors off-gassing from the contaminated surface.
           (2) Thickened agents are created by adding small amounts of selected
compounds to the agent and thoroughly mixing the substances. Agent thickening may
increase the time required for the agent to sorb into major terrain surfaces. During the
decontamination process, thickened agents generally require considerably more effort.




4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              B-7
          (3) Chemical-agent penetration of materials presents challenges that personnel
must recognize. Toxic vapors from absorbed liquid agents can penetrate nonporous
materials and create a residual vapor hazard, even though physical contact with the liquid
agent never occurred. Further, personnel must be aware that chemical agents can
penetrate barrier materials, such as plastic sheeting, and release toxic vapors on the
underside of the material. Table B-3 provides examples of agent penetration times for
common materials. Agent penetration over time is one of the reasons that contaminated
barrier materials should be replaced as soon as possible after an attack.
             Table B-3. Protective Capability of Common Barrier Material (in Minutes)
            Barrier Material        GD                TGD                    HD               VX

           NOTE: The criteria for these examples are the penetration of toxic vapor through the
           material.

      d.      Characteristics.
          (1) Chemical agents, like all other substances, may exist as solids, liquids, or
gases depending on temperature and pressure. Most wartime chemical agents used in
munitions are liquids, although some may be in a solid or dusty form. Following a
detonation of the munitions container, the agent is primarily dispersed as liquid or aerosol.
            (2) Certain chemical agents, such as selected nerve or blister agents, when
encountered during the warm months of the year at sea level are liquids, but they are
volatile to a certain extent. That is, they volatize or evaporate, just as water or gasoline
does, to form an often invisible vapor. A vapor is the gaseous form of a substance at a
temperature lower than the substance boiling point (BP) at a given pressure.
           (3) The tendency of a chemical agent to evaporate depends not only on its
chemical composition, vapor pressure, air temperature, and air pressure, but also on
variables such as wind velocity and the nature of the underlying surface with which the
agent is in contact. All external factors being equal, because of the respective agents vapor
pressures, pure mustard is less volatile than the nerve agent GB, but is more volatile than
the nerve agent VX. However, all of these agents evaporate more readily when the
temperature rises, a strong wind is blowing, or when they are resting on a nonporous
surface rather than on a porous surface.
           (4) When a chemical agent is disseminated as a vapor from a bursting
munition, the cloud initially expands, grows cooler and heavier, and tends to retain its
form. If the vapor density of the released agent is less than the vapor density of the air, the
cloud rises, mixes with the surrounding air, and dilutes rapidly. If the agent forms a dense
gas (the vapor density of the released agent is greater than the vapor density of air), the
cloud flattens, sinks, and flows over the earth’s surface.
          (5) Aerosols are finely divided liquid or solid substances suspended in the
atmosphere. Airborne aerosols behave in the same manner as vaporized agents, but are
heavier and tend to retain their forms and settle back to the earth.




B-8                       FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                      4 April 2006
           (6) When a chemical agent is used for its liquid effect, evaporation also causes
the agent to release chemical vapor. The liquid continues to evaporate while the liquid
droplets are airborne and for some period of time after reaching the surface. Agent vapor
pressure will govern the rate at which the liquid will evaporate. Once the liquid is no
longer present on the surface, the desorption (chemical agent vapor returning back into the
air) process begins.
           (7) Some agents may be in a powder or dusty form. Dusty agents are created
by soaking very small particles of inert substances in liquid chemical agents. These solid
particles retain about half of the agent that is found in a liquid droplet of the same size.
     e.   See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and
Chemical Reconnaissance for detailed information on detector capabilities and employment
techniques.
     f.    Chemical-Agent Response to Decontamination Practices.
           (1) When the decontamination process includes scrubbing, decontamination
effectiveness is greatly improved. This appears to be true whether the mode of action of the
decontaminant is principally chemical or physical because the mechanical action of
scrubbing allows a greater amount of agent to react at any given time. For example, testing
has shown that scrubbing is indispensable while using soapy water in the decontamination
of HD. In general, dissolving the agent in the decontaminant facilitates the rapid
destruction of an agent. Additionally, with a longer weathering time before
decontamination there is an increase in the decontamination effectiveness because of the
evaporation of the CW agent resulting in less CW agent requiring decontamination.
           (2) The overall subjective rating of the decontamination effectiveness of hot,
cold, or hot soapy water and steam for all surfaces and agents is: steam > hot water > hot
soapy water > cold soapy water > cold water. However, G and V agents are more soluble in
cold water than in hot and HD is more soluble in higher water temperatures.
           (3) Bleach is effective in removing agents from surfaces; however, it is not able
to remove agents that have already penetrated into the paint. Thus, while a bleach wash
will remove all the contamination from a painted surface, none is destroyed inside the paint
layer. To remove agent H from the paint, an organic solvent in the decontaminant is
usually required. Nonsorptive paints, such as CARC, inhibit the penetration of agent into
the paint layer, thus allowing the bleach to react with the agent.
5.   Toxic Industrial Material
     TIM can be found during all types of operations in peacetime or war.
      a.   A TIM hazard, whether manufactured, stored, distributed, or transported can
present hazards to US forces. TIM should be recognized for the hazard they pose and the
risks that may result from an explosion or fire. Most present a vapor (inhalation) hazard.
This vapor concentration may be very high at or near the point of release. It may also
reduce the oxygen concentration below what is required to support life. TIM are generally
categorized as shown in Table B-4.

      b.   Forces will generally operate in environments where there are TIM. If an
uncontrolled or deliberate release occurs, there may be an impact on the full range of
military operations. Most TIM are released as vapors. These vapors exhibit the same
dissemination characteristics as CW agents. The vapors tend to remain concentrated
downwind from the release point (RP) and in natural, low-lying areas such as valleys,
ravines, or man-made underground structures. High concentrations may remain in
buildings, woods, or any area with low air circulation. Explosions may create and spread
liquid hazards, and vapors may condense to liquids in cold air.
      c.   The most important action if TIM is released is the immediate evacuation of
personnel outside the hazard area. Use the Emergency Response Guidebook to identify
specific hazards and decontamination implications.
6.     Technical Reach-Back
     Technical reach-back is the capability to contact a technical SME when an issue
exceeds the on-scene subject matter expert’s (SMEs) capability. Reach-back should be
conducted using established unit protocols. Many of the reach-back resources listed in
Table B-5 have other primary missions and are not specifically resourced for reach-back.
Issues may include nonstandard agent decontamination of CBRN and TIM. This
information could include persistency, medical effects, and decontamination or protection
requirements.

                                 DECONTAMINANTS 


1.   Background
     A decontamination procedure is characterized by the use of specific decontaminants,
equipment, or actions to decontaminate an object; one or more modes of decontamination
may be involved. Each particular mode of decontamination is determined by the process
that best effects decontamination (i.e., chemical, physical, or natural processes). In most
decontamination procedures, all three modes of decontamination occur, supplementing each
other.
2.   Types of Decontaminants
     There are three general types of decontaminants—natural, standard, and
miscellaneous. There are also developmental decontaminants that are being tested and
evaluated.
     a.    Natural Decontaminants.
           (1) Weathering. Weathering gradually decomposes CB agents by aeration,
hydrolysis, and evaporation. The time necessary for decontamination by weathering
depends on the persistency of the agent, its composition, climatic conditions, and the type of
surface. Although weathering is the easiest method of decontamination, persistency of an
agent is difficult to predict. Therefore, mission deadlines, unfavorable weather conditions,
or hazards to unprotected personnel may require the use of a faster method of
decontamination. Contaminated surfaces will be posted with standard contamination
markers and may be left to the natural decontamination process. Natural weathering of a
chemical agent is the simplest method of decontamination and, in some cases, may be the
preferred method. If environmental conditions are suitable, weathering is an effective way
to decontaminate military materiel, including heavy equipment and vehicles. Increases in
the temperature and relative wind speed are the two key facts that accelerate the
evaporation of an agent from a contaminated surface. In areas where warm, sunny, windy,
and dry weather conditions exist, a substantial amount of agent would evaporate under
weathering conditions. On the other hand, evaporation may not be practical for
cold-weather or nighttime decontamination if there is a time constraint. Although
weathering is recommended for chemical agents with high volatilities, such as GD or GB,
their evaporation time frame would change when applied with a thickening agent. If time
constraints are of little consequence, evaporative decontamination by weathering is an
option for many materials in warm weather. The rate of weathering from surface types
examined (bare metal, painted metal surfaces) at approximately 25°C shows the following
order of decrease as a function of time: This order for the neat agents parallels what might
be expected from examining their vapor pressure (GD > TGD > HD > THD > VX).
                (a)   Air. Winds rapidly disperse the vapors of the chemical agents.
                  (b) Temperature and Wind. High temperatures speed up the change of
state for liquid vapor (evaporation) and hasten the dispersion of chemical agents in the air.
The persistency of the liquid chemical agents decreases as the temperature increases.
Because the CW agent evaporation rate approximately doubles with each 10°C increase in


4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              C-1
temperature and because evaporation increases an average of approximately 25 percent
with each 1 meter per second wind speed, the blowing of hot winds over CW
agent-contaminated areas should hasten the weathering process.
                (c) Humidity and Precipitation. Moisture tends to hydrolyze the chemical
agents. However, most agents hydrolyze very slowly. Heavy rain aids the decontamination
by mechanically removing the agents. However, it may cause a concentration of agents in
drainage areas, thus creating another contamination hazard.
                (d) Sunlight. Sunlight serves as a decontaminant. Even in cold weather,
the direct sun may warm surfaces above air temperature and hasten evaporation and
decomposition of the agents. Additionally, the sun’s UV radiation will destroy most BW
agents.
           (2) Earth (Covering). Earth can be used to seal in the contamination or as an
absorbent for the contamination. Covering an area with approximately 4 inches of earth
gives protection as long as the earth is not disturbed and the chemical agent exposed.
Additional protection may be obtained by mixing bleach with the earth. An area treated in
this manner may be subjected to light use; however, periodic monitoring will be required.
          (3) Fire. The ideal conditions for the use of fire are during periods of lapse
temperature gradient with a moderate wind speed away from friendly forces. Burning
operations could cause a downwind hazard and should be carried out with caution.
          (4)   Water.
                (a) Flowing water will flush agents from surfaces and will hydrolyze some
agents, such as mustard and lewisite. Hydrolysis is a very slow process and should not be
used as a primary means for decontamination. Hot water is a much more effective
decontaminant than cold water, and the addition of soap produces a more effective
decontaminant.
                (b) Although water alone will hydrolyze mustards and lewisites, a toxic
and blistering residue is formed. Scrubbing with hot, soapy water will physically remove
the residue; an alkaline solution will destroy the chemical-agent properties. Therefore,
water alone should not be used to decontaminate objects when it is practical to use
standard decontaminants.
               (c) High-pressure application produces a better cleaning action than low
pressure. Flushing will remove the surface contamination but will not affect the agent that
is sorbed.
                (d) Water used in decontamination operations is contaminated and must
not be disposed of in areas where it might flow or be washed into streams or other bodies of
water or where it might contaminate groundwater used as a water supply.
                 (e) Soaking contaminated items in boiling water is an excellent method of
decontamination. Soaking them in cold water is less effective. If hot water is not available
or if it might cause damage to the item, warm water may be used.
             (5) Soil. Soil should be considered a field-expedient decontaminating medium
whether or not other decontaminants are available for use. However, the effectiveness of
soil as a field-expedient decontaminant remains to be quantified. In all tests using soils or
clays as the decontaminating medium, it was concluded that as much material as possible
must be used for decontamination and that decontamination must begin as soon as


C-2                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60           4 April 2006
possible. The use of ample soil will help ensure the absorption of chemical agents and will
also reduce the amount of vapor that is released. Soil can be used to remove chemical
agents from surfaces by scouring and by sorption. Sorption occurs primarily in the clay and
organic soil fractions. In the absence of better absorbents, soil may be used in removing
liquid contamination from material; however, the used soil becomes contaminated and must
be treated as contaminated waste.
                 (a) Under various conditions, chemical agents that have been sorbed by
clay minerals can desorb, presenting a secondary hazard. Water has a tendency to hinder
the sorption process in soil. Water also contributes to the movement and redistribution of
chemicals entrapped in soils. The role in sorption and the inactivation of chemical agents
by the organic matter in soils is not fully known. Nerve agents are decomposed by
naturally occurring processes in the soil. The degradation of mustard also occurs; however,
the rates and data on the conditions are very sparse. Studies indicate that mustard is very
difficult to degrade by natural processes occurring in soil.
                (b) The way agent is held within various soil components is not
completely understood. Tests have shown that, following sorption, some agents can be
released from the soil; thus, they can contaminate individuals who come in contact with
contaminated soil. Work done with organophosphate insecticides indicates that clays will
probably not permanently adsorb nerve agents. Certain insecticides, and presumably
chemical agents, can remain in soil for long periods. Soil used in decontamination should
be marked, dated, and isolated.
                 (c) Testing has shown that soil can be effective when used simply as a
scouring material. However, coarse materials have the least effective surface area for
sorption and are, thus, less effective in this role. Clay is the most absorptive portion of the
soil. Table C-1 (page C-4) provides guidelines for the use of soil as a decontaminant.
     b.    Standard Chemical Decontaminants.
           (1)   STB.
                (a) Description and Use. STB is a decontaminating agent for most CW
agents. STB is a mixture of chlorinated lime and calcium oxide in a white powder form.
STB, in a diluted solution, can be substituted for household bleach. When manufactured, it
contains 30 percent available chlorine. Because of this chlorine content, a protective mask
and gloves should be worn when handling STB. STB decomposes slowly in storage; this
decomposition is easily recognized by the chlorine odor. STB can be expected to cause
serious degradation of electronic equipment, it is corrosive to most metals, and it is
injurious to most fabrics. It has a slight effect on nonmetals and a moderate effect on
sealants.
                (b) Chemical Action. STB decontaminates mustard, lewisite, and nerve
agents. The vapor given off during the reaction with chemical agents is likely to be toxic.
Bleach will produce a strong exothermic reaction with liquid mustard. This reaction may be
severe enough to produce a flame. STB may be applied directly to surfaces contaminated
with liquid mustard when there is no objection to potentially toxic vapors or if extreme heat
would not damage the surface. Mixing STB with water or earth facilitates its distribution
and diminishes the temperature resulting from its reaction with liquid mustard. Dry
surface and deposits of STB do not react with liquid chemical agents that have been
absorbed into the ground or other porous materials, because they do not come into direct



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                C-3
contact with the agent. However, as long as STB retains its chlorine content, it serves to
neutralize the vapors as they rise from the contaminated surface. Due to the decomposition
of STB, the covering should be renewed at least every 24 hours. If the seal is broken by
abrasion or traffic, the vapors will again become a hazard and the STB covering must be
renewed.
                    Table C-1. Guidelines for the Use of Soil as a Decontaminant
•	  Use any relatively dry soil as a decontaminant. Under adverse conditions, wet soil is better than nothing.
•	  Begin the decontamination procedure as soon as possible so that a high percentage of agents will be removed.
•	  Smear soil or mud on equipment prior to a chemical attack as a precautionary measure. This will provide
    preemptive sorption of liquid chemical agent. A soil or mud coating will also help protect against agent aerosols
    or vapor. A soil or mud patch could serve as a temporary barrier to seal small breaks or tears in protective
    coverings.
•	 Establish an order of priority when decontaminating unprotected surfaces so that items with porous surfaces are
    decontaminated first. For porous materials, the elapsed time between contamination and decontamination
    should be less than 15 minutes; for less porous materials, the elapsed time between contamination and
    decontamination should not exceed 1 hour. If these times are exceeded, decontamination with soil can still be
    performed; however, the effectiveness of the decontamination will be diminished.
•	 Rub soil over contaminated surfaces to hasten the agent absorption and facilitate the abrasive removal of the
    agent from equipment. Use caution when removing the agent from porous surfaces to avoid forcing the agent
    into the pores.
•	 Discard spent soil, and replace it with fresh soil between 30 seconds and 1 minute if additional decontamination
    is required. The absorptive capacity of soil used for decontamination will be exhausted.
•	 Use at least four times the minimum amount of soil required to remove the visible agent to complete
    decontamination.
•	 Identify or mark the used soil following decontamination so that it can be properly treated and avoided for as long
    as possible.
•	 Vacate any area where the soil was used as a decontaminant following decontamination because agent can
    slowly desorb as vapor from contaminated soil.
NOTE: If no better alternative exists, soil previously used for decontamination can be guardedly used again.
Processes in the soil slowly deactivate agents, thus the longer the time lapse since the use of a soil, the
safer it will be. Additionally, the agent will slowly desorb from the soil, which will further reduce soil
contamination.

                  (c) STB Mixtures. STB may be mixed with water to form a wet mixture
called “slurry”, or it may be mixed with dry earth to form “dry mix.”
                •     Slurry. There are two types of slurry: one for manual application and
the other for application by a PDDA. For manual application with swabs, brushes, or
brooms, the most effective slurry consists of approximately equal parts (by weight) of STB
and water, prepared by mixing 50 pounds of STB with 6 gallons of water. The
recommended load for a 500-gallon PDDA is 1,300 pounds (or approximately 26 fifty-pound
cans) of STB and 225 gallons of water. Detailed information about the preparation of slurry
for use in the M12A1 PDDA is in applicable equipment TOs and TMs. To prepare the
slurry, mix 100 pounds of STB with 20 gallons of hot water.
                  •    Dry Mix. This mixture consists of STB thoroughly mixed with dry
earth. The proportion by weight is two parts (two shovelfuls) of STB to three parts (three
shovels full) of earth or other dry material. Personnel may shuffle their boots in dry mix
before and after completing decontamination operations in which their boots are likely
exposed to agents. Dry mix may be placed under equipment to decontaminate any agent
flushed from it. For small-area decontamination, use approximately 1 pound of STB per
square yard for short, grassy areas and 3 to 5 pounds per square yard for bushy or wooded
areas for the decontamination of liquid chemical agents.


C-4	                     FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                           4 April 2006
                 (d) Use in Cold Weather. STB mixtures (dry mix and slurry) do not
effectively decontaminate agents that have become solidified as a result of low
temperatures.
                (e) Procedures after Decontamination. STB can be left on many surfaces
after use. However, it must be rinsed thoroughly from metal surfaces immediately
following the 30 minute contact time. Metal surfaces must then be oiled or greased to
prevent corrosion. On wood or other porous surfaces, several applications of STB may be
necessary. When decontamination is complete, surfaces must be flushed with water to
remove slurry.
            (2) High-Test Bleach (HTB) or HTH. HTH is a bleach material in granular or
tablet form, containing a minimum of 70 percent calcium hypochlorite. The compound
contains a higher percentage of chlorine than STB and is, therefore, more corrosive. HTH
can be used for the decontamination of individuals and personal protective material. HTH
will not blister paint during a decontamination operation that includes a prerinse and
postrinse; however, it can severely corrode metals. See Tables C-2 through C-4 for
information on preparing HTH solutions.

          (3) Reactive Sorbent Powder. This sorbent is a free-flowing, reactive, highly
absorptive powder manufactured from aluminum oxide. The M100 SDS replaces the M11


4 April 2006                     FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                                 C-5
and M13 decontamination apparatuses, portable (DAPs) that were employed in spray-down
operations associated with immediate decontamination. Each M100 SDS consists of two
0.7-pound packs of reactive sorbent powder, two wash mitt type sorbent applicators, a case,
straps, and detailed instructions. An optional chemical agent-resistant mounting bracket is
also available. The M100 SDS uses a reactive sorbent powder to remove chemical agents
from surfaces. The use of the M100 SDS decreases decontamination time and eliminates
the need for water.
      c.   Miscellaneous Decontaminants.
           (1) Soap provides a good cleansing medium for removing surface
contamination, dirt, or grease. By this action, mustard is emulsified and carried off; it is
not neutralized. Hot, soapy water is effective for decontaminating (neutralizing) G agents.
V agents will be destroyed slowly by hot, soapy water. Although soapy water will remain
effective as long as suds are maintained, a solution of 10 pounds of soap in 11 gallons of
water is recommended for the decontamination of G agents. An important use of soap is in
personnel decontamination and the removal of contamination from aircraft. Soap solution
may be used in PDDAs, and in bucket-and-broom procedures for the decontamination of
materials and surfaces. Soap is used in the decontamination of clothing by laundering.
           (2) Caustic Soda (Sodium Hydroxide or Lye). Caustic soda is a white solid that
dissolves easily in water or alcohol. The chemical name for caustic soda is sodium
hydroxide; it is commonly known as lye. Considerable amounts of heat are generated when
caustic soda is dissolved; therefore, containers must not be handled with bare hands. A
water solution of caustic soda will destroy G agents on contact. Caustic soda hastens the
hydrolysis of lewisite. However, mustard is destroyed only after prolonged contact with
caustic soda. An alcoholic solution of caustic soda will decontaminate BZ and VX agents.
                 (a) Preparation and Use. Water solutions of caustic soda are effective in
most concentrations, but normally the more concentrated the solution, the faster the
decontamination. Hot solutions decontaminate faster than cold solutions. A 5 percent
solution prepared by dissolving 5 pounds of caustic soda in 12 gallons of water is
recommended. Alcoholic solutions of caustic soda may be prepared by dissolving 5 pounds
of caustic soda in a mixture consisting of 6 gallons of water and 6 gallons of alcohol.
However, both woolen and cotton clothing are greatly deteriorated by even a 5 percent
solution. Solutions should not be prepared in aluminum, magnesium, tin, or zinc
containers. Contact with these metals causes the formation of flammable hydrogen gas.
Iron or steel containers are suitable. Glass or earthenware containers can be used in an
emergency if the solution is stirred constantly to keep the temperature down.
                 (b) Safety Precautions. Skin areas that come in contact with either the
solid or solution form of caustic soda should be washed immediately with a copious amount
of water. Affected clothing should be removed immediately. If the eyes are involved, they
should be flushed at once with a copious amount of warm water and the individual should
seek medical treatment. Personnel handling caustic solutions should wear rubber gloves
and protective masks or other respiratory and eye protective devices. Caustic soda burns
human tissue and eats away clothing on contact. Ingestion causes damage to the digestive
tract. Inhalation or ingestion of its dust or concentrated mist causes damage to the
respiratory system and digestive tract. Seek medical attention immediately. The use of a
mask and gloves is mandatory when handling caustic soda.




C-6                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
           (3) Washing Soda (Sodium Carbonate). Washing soda is a white powder
having alkaline properties. Commercial grades may contain large amounts of sodium
carbonate. Common names include soda ash and laundry soda. It does not destroy blister
agents as readily as caustic soda or sodium hypochlorite. In addition, it does not destroy V
agents as readily as sodium hypochlorite. A hot solution of washing soda is an effective
means of decontaminating CN. The solution, hot or cold, is very effective for the
decontamination of G agents and is recommended.
           (4) Ammonia (NH3) or Ammonium Hydroxide (NH4OH). Ammonium hydroxide
is a water solution of ammonia. Ammonia or its water solution is an effective
decontaminant (as a weak hydroxide) for several chemical agents. Ammonia may be used
to decontaminate the G agents; however, it is slower acting than caustic soda or caustic
potash.
           (5) Common Solvents. Common organic liquids such as deicing fluids,
kerosene, and alcohol may be used as solvents for many chemical agents. Most organic
solvents are fire hazards, and some are toxic. Use suitable safety precautions. Solvents
decontaminate by removing agents from contaminated surface; they do not destroy the
agent. The solvent action of the liquid varies with the nature of the contaminated surface
and the contaminant.
               (a) Use. Solvents must be used carefully to avoid spreading the
contamination. Swabs saturated with solvent are used on small areas. A contaminated
area is swabbed several times; swabs are changed as necessary. The number of times an
area is swabbed is determined by the amount of contamination, the amount of grease on the
surface, and whether the area will be treated with another decontaminant.
                 (b) Safety Precautions. After being used on a contaminated surface, the
cloth end of the swab must not touch bare skin or clothing. The solvent used to wash off the
agent becomes contaminated and must be disposed of as contaminated waste. If ground
contaminated with waste solvent is to be utilized, it must be decontaminated.
           (6) Degreasing Solvent. Degreasing solvents are noncorrosive,
water-dispersible liquids that are commonly used to clean aircraft and automotive engines
by absorbing grease and oily dirt. The solvent may be used in decontaminating procedures.
It may be diluted with water or kerosene and is effective in removing chemical agents by
solvent action through the removal of grease and oil holding the agent. After being applied
to contaminated equipment, the solvent is allowed to remain 15 minutes or more,
depending on the degree of contamination. Water, preferably under pressure, is used to
remove the solvent and to flush the dirt, grease, oil, and chemical agents from the
equipment. Contaminated waste must be disposed of properly.
           (7) Absorbents. Absorbents are various materials used to remove, but not
destroy, agents. Earth, charcoal, coal dust, clay, and sawdust may be used as absorbents.
The absorbents are contaminated after use and must be handled as contaminated waste.
          (8) Adsorbents. Adsorbent is a material used to adhere or become attached
mechanically or chemically to a chemical agent, but which does not destroy the agent. The
adsorbent is contaminated after use and must be handled as contaminated waste.
          (9) Household Bleach. Household bleach is 2 to 6 percent sodium hypochlorite
in water. For vehicle wash down, household bleach will corrode the metal parts of vehicles.
When the lack of water is a concern and a 5 percent available chlorine solution is needed,


4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              C-7
household bleach could be used for vehicle wash down. Bleach is useful to decontaminate
all types of microorganisms and most chemical agents.
       d.     Developmental Decontaminants.
           (1) DF 200. The DF 200 is an aqueous solution containing a peroxide activator
and hydrogen peroxide. DF 200 can be used for the decontamination of material and for the
following contamination on porous surfaces: G agents on concrete, asphalt, sand, and soil; H
agents on concrete; and V agents on asphalt and concrete. However, the operational
constraints in Table C-5 apply for the use of DF 200. At all times, operators working with
DF 200 will be in MOPP gear and all runoff will be collected and treated as potential
hazardous waste. Standard decontaminants should continue to be used for all other
chemical contamination and all biological decontamination.
                               Table C-5. Operational Limitations of DF 200
•	  Use mops and brushes as DF 200 applicators.
•	  Do not use degraded DF 200 for chemical and biological decontamination operations if STB or HTH is available.
    Degraded DF 200 is defined as DF 200 with compromised packaging, DF 200 without a lot number, DF 200 with
    an unknown storage temperature history, and/or DF 200 with a storage temperature history known to exceed
    85°F.
NOTE: Surface corrosion (rust) may degrade the ability of DF 200 to decontaminate chemical agents. DF 200
will produce surface corrosion of many unpainted/uncoated metallic and alloy surfaces.
•	 Use a hot, soapy water prewash and two applications (15-minute contact time) of DF 200 during thorough
    decontamination for VX and HD. Use a hot, soapy water prewash and one application (15-minute contact time)
    of DF 200 GD. Apply the DF 200 as a scrub.
•	   Do not use DF 200 on aircraft or optics. Limit DF 200 use on synthetic rubber or plastic materials (plastic
     windshields and seals) as much as possible under field conditions. Inspect nonmetallic material components for
     degradation after exposure to DF 200.
•	   Do not use DF 200 for any biological contamination, including porous surfaces.
•	   Maintain surface wetness with DF 200 for 30 minutes as DF 200 is active only when wet. Reapply and restart
     the 30-minute wet contact time if the DF 200 dries.
•	   Use DF 200 within 6 hours after mixing.
•	   Rinse nonpermeable clothing with water following exposure to DF 200. Do not expose semipermeable protective
     garments to liquid DF 200.
•	   Replace mask filters after each DF 200 decontamination mission. Replace mask filters after every 12 hours of
     DF 200 decontamination operations if decontamination operations are continuous.
•	 Use butyl gloves for up to 6 hours following exposure to DF 200. Use only 14- and 25-mil gloves for 24 hours
   after exposure to DF 200.
•	 Do not treat sumps containing DF 200 with STB or HTH. Use additional DF 200 for sump treatment.
•	 Rinse DF 200 from vehicles.
•	 Do not mix DF 200 and STB/HTH, and do not store them together.
•	 Use the M256A1 to verify decontamination following decontamination by DF 200.
NOTE: Detector responses to DF 200 are similar to other field decontaminants. DF 200 can interfere with the
accurate functioning of the USMC version of the CAM as well as all ICAMs, ACADAs, M8 paper, and M9
paper.

           (2) Decon Green. This decontaminant provides the decontamination of CW
agents even at low temperatures (-31°C). The solution is noncorrosive to common surfaces
of military interest and leaves no toxic residue. Besides chemical agents, this
decontaminant also affords the destruction of anthrax spores to undetectable levels. Decon
green consists of three components that are mixed together to provide the active
decontaminant. Once mixed, the solution must be used within 2 hours. When the solution

is applied, it should be rinsed off 15 minutes after application. The decontaminant can be
applied using a spray applicator. Personnel must use MOPP4 when mixing or applying this
decontaminant.
            (3) Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion (RSDL). The FDA has approved
RSDL for use by the US military. The lotion removes chemical agents or the T-2 toxin and
also reacts with the chemical agents, rapidly neutralizing them so they are non-toxic. RSDL
must be applied to exposed skin (intact) as soon as possible after exposure to a chemical
agent. The lotion is impregnated in a sponge pad packaged as a single unit in a heat-sealed
foil pouch.
3.   Decontamination Solution Preparation
     Several precautions must be followed when mixing STB or HTH. Use Tables C-2
through C-4 (page C-5) to mix the appropriate decontamination solutions.
     a.    Mixing STB Slurry. Add the STB to the water. Do not add detergent.

                                        WARNING 

                       DO NOT mix STB with anything except water. 



     b.   Mixing HTH Solutions. HTH is most effective in a solution with detergent. The
detergent brings the agent into solution and, thus, in contact with the hypochlorite, where
the chemical reaction can take place. In preparing the HTH decontamination solution,
always add HTH to the water, mix to dissolve, and then add the detergent and stir
thoroughly.

                                      WARNING
                   Never add water to HTH or add HTH to water with
                     which detergent has already been mixed. A
                    dangerous reaction may result in either case.


4.     Storage and Shelf Life
      The shelf life of HTH is 2 years. An expiration date is printed on each bottle. HTH is
an oxidizer and should be kept isolated from fuels, oils, greases, paints, organic solvents,
cellulose products, and any other material that is easily oxidized. These materials are
incompatible and may cause a violent reaction or fire. HTH will react with rags, fabrics,
detergent, antifreeze, and ammonia in addition to the materials listed previously. When
heated, HTH decomposes to chlorine gas, phosgene, and other toxic and corrosive fumes.
Do not use HTH near heat sources or open flames because toxic gases may be produced. Do
not stow oxidizers near heat sources, in areas adjacent to ammunition storage, or in areas
where the maximum temperature exceeds 100°F (37.8°C) under normal operating
conditions. Contact with moisture causes formation of toxic chlorine gas. Accidental
mixture with small amounts of water spray from firefighting may cause toxic-gas
formation. Drenching with excess water can control this reaction. Stowage areas shall be
kept cool, dry, and well-ventilated. Containers used for holding oxidizers should have a
warning label indicating their reactivity and associated hazards.
5.     Decontaminants
     See Tables C-6 through C-8 (pages C-11 to C-21) for a representative listing of
standard, miscellaneous, and natural decontaminants.

  DECONTAMINATION OF SPECIFIC SURFACES AND MATERIALS

     This appendix should be used to determine how to decontaminate various surfaces.
Table D-1 lists specific surfaces or materials and briefly explains the representative
methods of how to conduct a CBRN decontamination. In turn, detection and identification
equipment must be used to check the completeness of decontamination.

               SPECIAL DECONTAMINATION CONSIDERATIONS 


1.   Background
      This appendix addresses decontamination considerations for sensitive equipment,
munitions, CBRN munitions disposal, sample transfer and processing, DU, radioactive
isotopes, and contaminated remains.
2.   Vulnerable/Sensitive Equipment
      Most military equipment has not been critically assessed for its ability to withstand
decontamination without adverse effects. As more materiel testing is done, specific
decontamination instructions will be included in the applicable TMs/TOs for all types of
equipment. We know that some equipment is extremely vulnerable to damage when
subjected to decontamination. The decontamination of equipment containing vulnerable
components presents certain challenges. Electronics and optics are especially vulnerable to
damage if not carefully decontaminated. Some materials, such as canvas and rubber, tend
to absorb chemical agents. As a result, decontaminating absorbent surfaces is extremely
difficult, if not impossible. Many decontaminants are highly corrosive and cannot be used
on certain materials. They may also corrode and render ammunition unserviceable.

                                   CAUTION
                   Do not subject vulnerable equipment to
                   unnecessary decontamination.


      a.   Electronics. Moisture, dust, and corrosive decontamination materials can
damage unsealed electronic equipment circuitry. Most field electronic equipment is
watertight for environmental protection. This also provides good protection against CBRN
contamination. Contamination will probably not penetrate gasket-equipped protective
covers and sealed components on electronic equipment; but if exposed, the contaminants
may be present on the outside of cases containing the electronic equipment. Wipe down the
outside portions of the equipment case with a designated decontaminant. After
decontaminating the outside, wipe down the equipment with water or an approved solvent
to remove traces of decontaminant solutions. If equipment seals appear damaged or the
penetration of CBRN contamination into the inside of the equipment is suspected, then the
unit should be treated as if it was unsealed. Under no circumstances should electronic
equipment be immersed in a decontaminant solution or subjected to high-pressure
application of decontaminant solutions. The following high-value electronic equipment
presents examples of items that would be damaged by corrosives:
     •     Joint, Helmet-Mounted Cueing System.
     •     AN/PVS-4 night vision goggles.
     •     AN/TVS-5A night vision goggles.
     •     AN/PVS-7B night vision goggles.
     •     M12 range finder.

      •   Tow sight.
      •   M49 telescope.
      •   AN/TAS-5 Thermal Imagery System.
      •   AN/TAS-6 night vision sight, Thermal Imagery System.
      •   AN/GRC-160 radio set.
      •   AN/MRC-69 radio-telephone set.
      •   AN/PRC-119 radio set.
      •   AN/PRC-139 radio set.
      •   AN/TRC-68 radio set.
      •   AN/VRC-12 radio set.
      •   AN/VRC-87 radio set.
      •   AN/VRC-92 radio set.
      •   AN/VRC-87 Single-Channel, Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).
      •   AN/VRC-92 SINGARS.
           (1) For chemical contamination, use M100 sorbent on metal electronic cases.
For biological agents, wipe the equipment exterior with a cloth and hot, soapy water or use
a miscellaneous decontaminant (see Appendix C). If contamination is not extensive, use the
M295 decontamination kit.
           (2) Corrosive decontaminants should never be used on unsealed electronic
equipment. This type of equipment is often found inside shelter assemblies and helicopters.
Refer to the appropriate TMs or TOs for acceptable decontamination procedures for
unsealed electronic equipment.
           (3) For radiological contamination, brush, wipe, or vacuum contamination from
equipment. The contamination is not destroyed, just moved from one place to another. So,
control the runoff and treat it as a hazardous substance.
     b.    Optics. Optical systems are extremely vulnerable to decontamination materials
that might scratch or adversely affect the lenses. Wipe optical systems with a soft,
nonabrasive material such as a lens-cleaning tissue, cotton wadding, or a soft cloth dipped
in hot, soapy water. Wipe the optical system with decontaminants. Do not immerse it.
         (1) Hot, soapy water is the preferred decontaminant for chemical and biological
contamination. The M291 SDK may be used if hot, soapy water is not available.
NOTE: Do not use the M295 IEDK. It contains an abrasive sorbent, which may
damage the optics.
           (2) Radiological contamination should be blown off with a stream of air or
wiped off with hot, soapy water. Rinse the surface by wiping with a sponge dipped in clean
water.
     c.   Ammunition. Decontaminate contaminated ammunition with cool, soapy water.
Apply with a PDDE, brushes, mops, rags, or brooms. Cool, soapy water is the preferred
decontaminant for all types of contamination on ammunition.


E-2                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         4 April 2006
                                        CAUTION
                     Do not use STB on ammunition. It removes critical
                 markings from ammunition. It may also corrode and render
                    ammunition unserviceable. Do not use nonstandard
                 decontaminants that are corrosive. They also may remove
                           critical markings from the ammunition.

     d.    Supplies.
           (1) Canvas Items. Some materials, such as canvas, tend to absorb chemical
agents and may not be decontaminated and reused. These items include LBE and web
gear. Decontamination is difficult. It may be necessary to burn or bury them if they are
heavily contaminated with a chemical agent. Either STB dry mix or slurry may be used.
Slurry is more effective. In many cases, weathering may be the preferred decontamination
technique because scrubbing canvas frequently imbeds the contamination further and
worsens the situation. If the item must be decontaminated, boiling for 1 hour in soapy
water is the preferred decontaminant for chemical and biological contamination.
Radioactive contamination can be removed by brushing and then washing. It may also be
vacuumed. Other options for disposing of contaminated canvas should be considered
against METT-TC. CBRN protective covers protect vulnerable items, but these covers
should be buried or destroyed after use.
           (2)   Subsistence and Water.
                 (a) Decontamination removes the contaminant and provides food that is
safe for consumption. Food salvage operations require extensive efforts to assess, identify,
and evaluate. These efforts are further compounded if food supplies are suspected of being
comprised by CBRN contaminates. Decontamination efforts require even more elaborate
procedures that impact labor, time, and supplies of operational forces. The use of
appropriate decontamination must be emphasized to fit the situation and meet the mission.
That is, decontaminate just enough to sustain operations and keep fighting, rather than
creating a contamination-free environment. Normally, decontamination efforts will be
limited to the scope and nature of the packaging and packing materials.
                 (b) The first critical step is to take appropriate personal precautions
before starting decontamination procedures and dividing suspected exposed food items into
groups. Based on the division of food items, the time of exposure and the possible exposure
agent may be identified. Listed below are the food groups by priority, based on the ease of
decontamination and the ability to monitor the items in question:
                 •     Group I. Canned or packaged items exposed only to a CW agent
vapor.
                 •    Group II. Canned or packaged items that are contaminated on the
outside with a liquid CW agent, a BW agent, or radioactive fallout.
               •   Group III. Unpacked or poorly packaged items that have been
exposed to any CBRN agent.
                 •     Group IV. Food contaminated through the food chain.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            E-3
                 (c) There are three levels of decontamination for subsistence. These are
individual, unit, and support levels. See FM 4-02.7 for definitive information on
subsistence decontamination.
               •     Individual decontamination of subsistence is performed by each
service member on the subsistence items in his possession at the time of the attack.
Decontamination procedures are conducted as outlined in the unit tactical standard
operating procedure (TSOP) and in FM 4-02.7.
                 •    Unit personnel under the supervision of CBRN-trained personnel
organic to the unit perform this level of decontamination as soon as possible after a CBRN
attack and in conjunction with area decontamination procedures. Decontamination is
attempted only on subsistence items that are in original, intact containers that do not
permit or have not allowed CBRN penetration. Special decontamination requirements and
advisability of decontamination efforts are relayed to unit commanders through command
or medical channels as required.
                  •    Specially trained and equipped decontamination units and teams
accomplish support levels of decontamination. This is accomplished at major subsistence
storage facilities and areas, such as the general support (GS) Class I activities in the
theater. Medical personnel advise on technical matters pertaining to the decontamination
operations involving subsistence items and also monitor the decontamination results and
recovery operations.
                (d) Contaminated water must not be used until it has been treated by
quartermaster water production and distribution units or other equally capable water
purification units and approved for use by the medical authority. The treatment of
contaminated water requires chemicals and equipment that are only available to
specialized water purification units; individuals or units should not attempt to treat their
water. The decontamination of water is only undertaken when uncontaminated sources are
not available, and then only with the approval of the medical authority. See FM 10-52 for
details.
           (3) Painted Surfaces. Chemical agents will penetrate alkyd-painted vehicles
and will desorb small quantities of agent for hours to days (depending on certain factors,
such as temperature). However, most systems are CARC-painted. CARC-painted surfaces
significantly reduce agent penetration and are decontaminated more effectively than alkyd-
painted surfaces.
           (4) Vegetation. Vegetation also affects the persistency of chemical
contamination. When dispersed over vegetation, some of the chemical agent droplets cling
to the vegetation. This increases the surface area of agent exposed to the elements and the
rate of evaporation, but the contamination may be more dangerous because personnel may
be more likely to come into contact with the contaminated plants. In shaded woods, despite
the greater surface area covered by the agent, the reduced ambient temperature and winds
increase the persistency of the chemical agent.
3.    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Munitions Disposal
      CBRN enemy munitions or other improvised devices may be encountered. Captured
enemy CBRN munitions or agents may have sustained damage or be leaking due to
deterioration. Leaking munitions must be decontaminated, evacuated, and disposed of
safely by specialized units, such as EOD, who have properly trained personnel to perform


E-4                 FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         4 April 2006
this task. All personnel must use the applicable IPE when there is a possibility of
exposure. Notify an EOD unit for the disposal and decontamination of CBRN munitions.
4.   Sample Transfer, Evacuation, and Processing
      If the decontamination unit headquarters requires a sample of the agent for
confirmation, it will be collected and packaged by the unit or activity obtaining the sample.
The sample is properly labeled, bagged, and prepared for evacuation. The sample is
evacuated according to the procedures outline in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Biological Surveillance.
5.   Depleted-Uranium Decontamination
      DU is an extremely dense metal used in munitions to penetrate heavy armor or as
protective shielding (armor packages). DU is also used as equipment components. Unfired
shells or intact DU armor does not exceed peacetime regulatory standards for personal
exposure. Unfired or intact DU does not present a health risk.
     a.   DU exposure and incidents may occur anytime there is damage to the DU armor
package, a vehicle is hit with DU munitions, DU munitions are damaged, or equipment
components containing DU are damaged. The DU armor can be damaged during vehicle
maneuvers, onboard fires, maintenance activities, or ballistic impacts. DU munition
problems may occur during storage, transportation, combat, testing, or manufacturing. DU
contamination may be present on the ground in areas where equipment was destroyed or
damaged. The USAF primarily uses DU in aircraft counterbalances and in 30-millimeter
(mm) armor-piercing and incendiary munitions.
           (1) DU can present a number of hazards, depending on its physical (solid
versus particulate) and chemical forms. These hazards can be grouped into three
categories: radiological, toxicological, and pyrophoric.
                (a)   Radiological.
                •    DU presents a radiological hazard from external and internal
radiation dose standpoints. Externally, DU and its decay products emit beta and gamma
radiations that can serve as sources of external radiation for personnel. Contact gamma
dose rates from bare DU can be 15 millirems per hour (mrem/hr), while skin contact dose
rate due to beta radiation from bare DU is approximately 238 mrem/hr.
                •     Internally, insoluble DU oxide can be inhaled and deposited into the
lungs, where irradiation by alpha particles is the primary concern. In general, aircraft
counterbalances and DU penetrators used in munitions are typically covered to prevent
corrosion (oxidation). The primary groups at risk for external exposure are munitions
handlers and aircraft maintenance personnel. The primary groups at risk for internal
exposure are personnel involved with DU contamination that can potentially become
airborne and subsequently inhaled.
                 (b) Toxicological. Soluble forms of DU can present a significant
toxicological hazard. Like any heavy metal, DU can be ingested or inhaled into the body
and, subsequently, enter the blood stream. It may be toxic to the kidneys and other organs.
                (c) Pyrophoric. The pyrophoric hazard presented by DU is normally
associated with fine particulates of metallic DU generated during fabrication processes.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              E-5
Particulate oxides of DU are generated as a result of normal corrosive processes on exposed
DU, fires, and penetrator impact with armor, but are not pyrophoric.
            (2) Military and civilian vehicles may become contaminated with DU either as
a result of direct penetrator strikes, by traveling through a DU-contaminated environment,
or as a result of an accident or fire. Penetrators striking an armored target essentially burn
their way through the armor. As a result, DU oxide particles are formed and can be
deposited in or on the vehicle or short distances downwind (typically less than 100 yards).
The metal surrounding the DU penetration hole is generally the area of highest
contamination. The amount of DU contamination resulting from a crash of an aircraft
having DU counterbalances is dependent on its physical integrity.
            (3) Environmental media (and water) can be a receptor of contamination from
other sources (i.e., weathering of intact DU components, DU released from penetrator
strikes or fire). The level of this contamination is minor in comparison to that encountered
on vehicle surfaces, exposed counterbalance surfaces, etc. The one exception is hard-target
range operations involving DU munitions that are left exposed to oxidize and further add to
the soil contamination.
          (4) Ingestion or inhalation of DU from any form of contaminated media is the
primary hazard of concern. Taking the necessary precautions to minimize these risks
requires appropriate PPE (i.e., clothing and detection equipment) and procedures.
Required procedures and equipment will vary depending on the type of work to be
accomplished. Some common sense rules to apply when dealing with radioactive material
are—
                (a) Evacuate or cordon off the area and avoid it when radioactive
contamination is present. If you must work in a contaminated environment, wear
protective equipment. Also, health monitoring or exposure control operations will be
required.
                 (b) Ensure that your protective equipment is operational and appropriate
for the task to be accomplished.
                (c)    Do not eat, drink, or smoke in a potentially contaminated area.
                 (d) Roll down your sleeves, wear gloves, and cover any exposed skin areas.
This provides protection from alpha and beta radiation in the form of particles. Pay
particular attention to protecting open cuts or wounds, and wear a protective mask.
Depending on temperature, protective clothing availability, DU contamination levels, and
tasks to be performed, wear your overgarment or coveralls or roll down your sleeves and
blouse your trousers as directed by CBRN or medical personnel. Dust off your uniform
after leaving a vehicle and before removing your protective mask. Always exercise
standard field hygiene, including washing your hands and face.
                (e)    Limit external hazards by wiping or washing exposed areas as soon as
possible.
                (f) Minimize time, maximize distance, and maximize shielding to keep
any doses received as low as possible.
                (g) Assume a DU contamination zone at 50 meters around actively
burning fires involving any armored combat vehicles or ammunition supply vehicles.

      b.  DU contamination may include DU oxides (dust), contaminated shrapnel,
munitions components, or armor components. DU primarily emits alpha particles;
however, beta, gamma, and X-ray ionizing radiation are also emitted. DU contamination
can be inhaled, ingested, or injected. DU contamination does not pose an immediate health
risk. Damaged or destroyed enemy or friendly armor vehicles may be DU-contaminated.
Unless an individual has a valid reason to enter such vehicles, he should stay away from
them. Consequently, contamination should be removed from personnel or vehicle surfaces
when directed by the unit commander based on METT-TC considerations.
     c.     Visual signs that DU contamination is present include heavy, dull, black dust or
small, round holes. DU contamination can only be verified with a radiac meter. An
AN/VDR-2 (beta shield open) or AN/PDR-77 with an alpha or beta probe (flat-pancake
surface) is used to detect and measure DU contamination. These probes are included in the
radiological protection officer kit.
     d.    General decontamination procedures are as follows:
     •     Use a radiac meter to determine if DU contamination is present.
      •   Provide protection, including appropriate clothing, for workers as directed by the
unit chemical or medical personnel.
     •     Identify what is to be decontaminated.
     •     Obtain necessary equipment and materials.
     •   Brush, wash, or wipe off contamination with a damp cloth. Use a HEPA filter
vacuum cleaner if available.
     •     Work from the outside of the contaminated area to the inside.
    •     Cover fixed contamination with tape, paint, paper, plastic, or other disposable
material.
     •    Use the standard double-bag-and-tag process for hazardous waste. The only
contaminated waste generated by DU will be the vacuum cleaner bags after use on multiple
vehicles.
6.   Decontamination of Specific Radioisotopes
     Radiological contamination may occur in the form of one element. In this section, the
decontamination of six specific, commonly found radioactive elements is discussed. The
discussion is applicable not only to these elements but also to other elements having similar
chemical properties.
      a.   Cesium. The common radioisotope of cesium is cesium-137. It emits beta and
gamma radiation, decaying to stable barium-137. Cesium-137 is widely used in gamma
sources. It occurs in these sources as cesium chloride pellets. Cesium chloride is a soluble
salt. The contamination from a sealed source leak absorbs water, becomes damp, and
creeps. Contamination from a sealed cesium source is best decontaminated by wet
procedures unless the contamination is on a porous surface, in which case, vacuuming
should precede wet procedures. Cesium is known to adsorb from solution onto glass
surfaces. The decontamination of a cesium liquid-contaminated surface is best
accomplished by wetting the surface, absorbing the solution with a rag or other absorbent
material, and rinsing the area several times with water. If the contamination persists,



4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              E-7
brushing and a detergent solution should be used. A cesium-contaminated solution which
has been standing for some time is best decontaminated by absorbing any remaining liquid,
treating the surface several times with water (allowing the water to stand on the surface
about 1 minute each time), and then absorbing the liquid from the surface. If the
contamination remains, further treatment depends on the surface. Metallic surfaces are
treated with strong mineral or oxidizing acids. Waxed surfaces are removed. If
contamination still persists, abrasion or other removal techniques are used.
      b.   Cobalt. The common radioisotope of cobalt is cobalt-60, a beta gamma emitter.
Metallic cobalt-60 is commonly used in sealed gamma sources. Particles of cobalt dust
adhering to small articles are readily removed by ultrasonic cleaners or by dipping in a
dilute solution of nitric, hydrochloric, or sulfuric acid. Cobalt dust contamination that
exists over a large area is best removed by vacuuming. Sealed cobalt sources may leak as a
result of an electrolytic action between cobalt and the container. The result is often a
soluble cobalt salt that creeps and spreads. This is best decontaminated with a detergent
or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution, followed by treatment with mineral
acids. Contamination from solutions containing cobalt may be treated with water solutions.
      c.    Plutonium. The most common isotope in which plutonium may be present as a
contaminant is plutonium-239, an alpha emitter. This isotope is present in the AN/UDM-6
calibration source. Plutonium contamination may be a result of a nuclear-weapon accident,
in which case the plutonium will be scattered as metal or oxide in a dust form. Both forms
of plutonium are insoluble. The aging of plutonium-239 contamination is impractical since
it has a 24,000-year half-life. Plutonium contamination that covers a small area is best
decontaminated by vacuuming. If contamination remains, the area should be washed with
a detergent solution. Any contamination that remains can be sealed in a protective coating
of paint, varnish, or plastic. Plutonium oxide or metal dust spread over a large area (e.g., a
field) is best decontaminated by removing the top layer of soil and disposing of it as
radioactive waste. Personnel should wear respiratory protection when decontaminating or
moving the soil.
      d.   Strontium. The most common radioisotope of strontium is strontium-90, a beta
emitter. The daughter particle of strontium-90 is yttrium-90, which is also a beta emitter.
Strontium-90 and yttrium-90 are commonly used in sealed beta sources, such as the M6
source. Generally it is present as chlorine or carbonate. The chlorine is hygroscopic; it
absorbs water and creeps out of the container. This contamination is best decontaminated
by vacuuming, followed by treatment with water, complexing agent solution, and mineral
acid in that order. Contamination resulting from a dilution containing strontium is best
decontaminated by absorbing the solution and washing the area with a detergent solution.
If strontium contamination persists, the top layer of the surface should be removed by
abrasion or another removal procedure and a sealing coat should be placed over the surface.
       e.   Tritium. Tritium is the radioisotope of hydrogen and is a weak beta emitter. If
it is released to an area as a gas, the best method of decontamination is to flush the area
with air. Since inhalation of tritium can present an internal hazard, personnel entering an
area containing tritium gas should wear an appropriate SCBA. Objects in an area exposed
to tritium may absorb the gas and should be disposed of if possible. They may be degassed
under a vacuum by flushing with helium or hydrogen. A cleaned surface may be
contaminated again in a matter of hours by percolation of absorbed tritium to the surface.
There is no practical way of removing tritium oxide from water due to its similarity to
natural water.

     f.    Uranium. The most probable source of uranium contamination is a
nuclear-weapon accident in which the fissionable uranium is spread as metal or oxide dust.
The common isotopes of uranium contamination are uranium-235 and uranium-238. This
metal or oxide is insoluble and is best removed from a contaminated surface by brushing or
vacuuming, treating with mineral acids or oxidizing acids, and then sealing. Large-area
uranium contamination is best decontaminated by removing the top layer of the surface or
by sealing.
7.   Contaminated-Remains Decontamination
     Mortuary affairs personnel are responsible for coordinating the disposition of
contaminated remains. This includes the decontamination of remains when required.
      a.   Introduction. Command responsibilities (i.e., service, combatant commander,
subordinate unit) for mortuary affairs are outlined in Joint Publication (JP) 4-06. The TTP
for processing contaminated remains are also outlined in JP 4-06.
          (1) Command mortuary affairs support plans are prepared based on
supporting the operational requirements of the command. Mortuary affairs support plans
may differ in scope, detail, objectives, and available resources between commands.
            (2) When planning the level of mortuary affairs support, consider multiple
factors, to include the possibility of searching, recovering, evacuating, and decontaminating
contaminated remains.
            (3) When a CBRN event has occurred on the battlefield, there is a possibility
that deceased personnel were exposed to contaminating agents. If the situation does not
lend itself to the determination of a hazard on an individual basis, all remains within the
affected area will be treated as if contaminated. If the theater surgeon or staff determines
that biological agents have been employed, all remains will be treated as if contaminated.
      b.   Concept of the Operation. A mortuary affairs decontamination collection point
(MADCP) may become operational whenever the threat of CBRN warfare exists. The Joint
Mortuary Affairs Office (JMAO) acts as the theater central point of contact for coordination
for this operation. The handling of contaminated remains is a process consisting of the
following:
         (1) The MADCP is deployed to the area concerned for the recovery of
contaminated remains. The MADCP will set up operations just outside the contaminated
area.
         (2) Upon verification that the remains have been decontaminated, they are
evacuated to the theater mortuary evacuation point or designated holding area.
          (3) The final verification of decontamination completeness will be conducted
within the theater.
     c.    Responsibilities.
          (1) Geographic combatant commanders are responsible for searching,
recovering, tentatively identifying, and evacuating remains from their areas of
responsibility (AORs). They ensure that the proper planning, training, staffing, and
equipment is furnished for mission requirements (e.g., ensuring proficiency of team
personnel on CBRN protective measures and providing CBRN specialists for the MADCP).
           (2)   Service component commanders are responsible for providing or arranging


4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60             E-9
for mortuary affairs support for their personnel.
           (3) Subordinate commanders at all levels are responsible for the initial search,
recovery, tentative identification, and evacuation of all deceased unit personnel within their
area of operation (see FM 10-64 and JP 4-06). If the threat of CBRN is suspected or
present, commanders will request MADCP support to perform recovery operations and the
subsequent decontamination of remains.
       d.   CBRN Search, Recovery, Tentative Identification, and Evacuation Operations.
            (1) CBRN search, recovery, tentative identification, and evacuation are the
first steps in the care and handling of deceased personnel during MADCP operations. To
ensure successful mission accomplishment, the leader of the MADCP conducting the search
and recovery must gather all available information for the mission such as coordinating
with intelligence, medical, and CBRN personnel on potential hazards. Personnel assigned
to support MADCP must be thoroughly trained in CBRN defense and the use of personnel
protective measures and personnel detection. During search operations, if a CBRN hazard
is suspected or if an unknown hazard situation exists, the MADCP will assume the
appropriate protective posture (e.g., MOPP4).
          (2) MADCP recovery personnel will be in CBRN IPE when conducting recovery
missions. When remains are encountered, check them for unexploded ordnance, explosives,
and booby traps. Ensure that all hazardous items are removed. Coordinate with a
supporting CBRN or EOD specialist/team for assistance or guidance when CBR agents or
hazardous items are suspected. Once contaminated remains are determined to be safe to
handle, proceed with the recovery.
           (3) The remains are placed in a CB human remains pouch, if available, and
care is taken to minimize the spread of contamination. When a CB pouch is not available,
the Type II-A human remains pouch should be used.
NOTE: The human remains pouch does not retain all fluids, and off-gassing of
vapor can occur through pouch membranes.
          (4) Recovery site operations outlined in FM 10-64 are followed, to include
indicating (if known) whether the remains are contaminated and marked (i.e., annotating
applicable forms and markers to indicate CBR contamination).
         (5) Personnel evacuating contaminated remains to a MADCP remain in IPE.
The transport means used to evacuate contaminated remains is monitored and
decontaminated as required.
       e.   Mortuary Affairs Decontamination Collection Point.
          (1) Mortuary affairs personnel establish and operate the MADCP. MADCP
operations adhere to the procedures outlined in JP 4-06.
            (2) Personnel support is required after completing the evacuation mission to
the MADCP, such as thorough DTD. The conduct of DTD takes about 1 hour. The MADCP
site will also receive support from a supporting decontamination unit for a complete DTD.

8.   Animals
    Throughout history, animals have played an important part in military operations.
Today, military working dogs (MWDs) continue to provide support to the warfighter.
     a.    The decontamination of MWDs and other government-owned animals (GOAs)
should be accomplished by MWD handlers and supporting veterinarian personnel in
accordance with FM 4-02.18. Contaminated MWDs and other GOAs are decontaminated in
a manner similar to that of service members. The initial decontamination of the animal
should be completed with an M291 SDK. The initial decontamination of the handling
equipment (leashes, collars, muzzles) should be completed with an M295 IEDK, a 5 percent
hypochlorite solution, or a 5 percent sodium solution (G agents only).
NOTE: Each MWD handler should carry several extra M291s and an extra M295.
     b.    Definitive decontamination requires the removal and replacement of all
contaminated handling equipment and the thorough washing of the animal with soap and
water, followed by a thorough rinsing with water. If soap is not available, copious rinsing
with water alone should provide adequate decontamination. Each handler should store
extra handling equipment in a chemically protected container.

      EFFECTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON DECONTAMINATION 


1.   Background
      US forces may find themselves anywhere in the world and subjected to the conditions
in that region. Weather and terrain conditions will influence the decontamination process
used. The conditions in cold weather and arctic areas, hot weather and desert areas, urban
areas, mountains, and jungles impact how decontamination operations are performed. If
METT-TC allows, permitting the contamination to weather is generally a preferred option.
However, marking, reporting, and periodically rechecking the contamination is required.
The effects of the environment will also impact decontamination manpower requirements.
2.   Cold Weather
      Cold can kill, maim, and disable without any help from a human foe. Cold weather
regions are characterized by extreme cold weather and deep snow during winter months.
Whiteout, gray out, and ice fog are weather phenomena that have an impact on northern
operations. In whiteout, a person seems to be surrounded by an unbroken white glow.
Gray out is similar to a whiteout except that the horizon is distinguishable. Depth
perception and orientation are lost in the absence of shadows, the horizon, and clouds. Ice
fog forms when water vapor is produced by human activities and the air at low
temperatures is unable to hold the moisture. Ice fog may appear over personnel, vehicles,
bivouac areas, and permanent facilities, marking their location. Ice fog can obscure vision.
     a.    Chemical Agents. Chemical agents also react differently at extremely low
temperatures. For example, at 32°F (0°C), HD, CX and HT become solids. As the
temperature drops to minus 15°F (minus 25°C), AC, CK, HN-3, and PD become solids.
Munitions containing normally persistent agents become very persistent at low
temperatures, and some normally nonpersistent chemicals become persistent. GB, a
normally nonpersistent agent, could remain a transfer hazard for up to 30 days in arctic
climates. Although frozen agents do not present a significant problem in solid state, they
become hazards when they warm up. See Table F-1 (page F-2) for the freezing/melting
points of selected chemical agents.

      b.   Decontaminants. Decontamination is a problem because low temperatures also
reduce the effect of decontaminants. When temperatures reach 32°F, water can no longer
be used. In such situations, use STB or HTH as a dry mix (two parts of STB to three parts
of unfrozen earth). If unfrozen dirt is not available, use snow (same proportion). Apply the
dry mix by shoveling it on contaminated surfaces or by filling sandbags with the mix and
dusting it on the surfaces. Remove the dry mix by brushing, scraping, or using
uncontaminated earth or snow to “wash” it off. Other decontaminating methods using
nonstandard solvents and fuels may be used, but observe fire safety, protect personnel from
corrosives, and take precautions against supercooling effects. Because of their low freezing
points, solvents such as aviation fuel (JP-8), diesel fuel, and kerosene may be used to
physically remove contamination. These solvents only flush the agent from the surfaces.
They generally do not neutralize agents nor do they eliminate agents that soak into
surfaces. Nonstandard solvents generally are very flammable and must be handled with
care.


F-2                         FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                  4 April 2006
     c.    Decontamination Operations.
          (1) Decontamination apparatuses and water trucks may have to be deployed
with empty tanks instead of full ones as in temperate climates. To prevent freezing, it may
be necessary to preheat water when loading water trucks and the tanks of decontaminating
apparatuses and keep it heated until it is used. These vehicles may have to be enclosed and
warmed so that the engines will start. Decontaminate apparatuses and drain water trucks
immediately after use to prevent damage from freezing.
            (2) Vehicles and personnel covered with contaminated snow should be
decontaminated before the snow has a chance to melt and freeze. Such snow forms layers
of ice that make contamination difficult to remove. Radioactive fallout that is mixed with
snowfall must be removed as soon as possible. Use tree branches (if available) to remove
contaminated snow.
           (3) Snow can be used to cover contamination; however, the snow can blow
away or the contamination can resurface when tracked vehicles, personnel movement, or
digging disturbs it. Snow cover provides some protection if left undisturbed, but this
protection is too uncertain to rely on.
           (4) Personnel supporting cold weather decontamination operations may use
warming areas for rest and relief. However, if personnel get a frozen agent on their
clothing, the agent will be hard to detect because low temperatures have slowed its
evaporation.
           (5) Moving vehicles through the decontamination site will be a challenge.
Caution must be exercised. It will be hard for the vehicles to navigate and stop if there is
ice present on the ground.
3.   Hot Weather (Desert and Jungle)
     Hot weather can considerably complicate decontamination operations.
      a.   Desert Areas. Extreme temperatures characterize desert regions with ranges
varying between 30°F to 130°F over a 24-hour period. These regions have long drought
periods, which are interrupted by sudden rains that bring flash floods. There are shortages
of suitable groundwater. Large areas suitable for tracked-vehicle maneuvers may
sometimes have impassable ravines; wet, spongy grounds; and sand areas.
           (1) Water. The principal problem for decontamination in the desert is the lack
of water. The use of STB slurry will burden the logistical system because of the water
required for mixing and rinsing. Non-water-based decontaminants (natural solvents) may
be required. Contamination avoidance becomes increasingly important in desert operations
because of limited water sources.
          (2) Heat Stress. Heat stress is a critical issue for personnel. Operating
decontamination stations in daytime temperatures may require short periods of work
followed by long periods of rest. See Chapter II for guidance on work/rest cycles.
          (3) Weathering. Weathering is a viable decontamination option. High daytime
temperatures can increase the evaporation of liquid contamination. For example, if a
vehicle were contaminated with THD in a hot, desert environment, at least 99 percent of
the contamination would have evaporated within 2 hours. Therefore, vehicle wash down
may not be necessary. As a result, vapor concentrations will be high but should not last



4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              F-3
long. If liquid contamination soaks into soft, porous soil (such as loose sand), evaporation is
not as quick. Strong winds also increase the evaporation rate. Low temperatures during
the night have a reverse effect and tend to increase the persistency of chemical and
biological contamination. The sandblasting effect of sandstorms may remove contamination
from surfaces facing the storm. Desert sunlight and high temperatures will destroy many
CB agents without additional decontamination measures.
          (4) Bearings and Other Critical Moving Parts. Bearings and other critical
moving parts need extra lubrication in the desert. This complicates decontamination
because lubricants tend to absorb chemical agents. After a sandstorm, maintenance must
be conducted regardless of the last scheduled maintenance. Therefore, perform
decontamination first and, if time is critical, decontaminate only those surfaces that will be
touched during maintenance. This will not eliminate vapor hazards.
     b.    Jungle Areas. The characteristics of jungle climates vary with the location.
Close to the equator, all seasons are nearly alike, with rains throughout the year. Farther
from the equator, especially in India and Southeast Asia, jungles have distinct wet
(monsoon) and dry seasons. Both zones have high temperatures averaging 78°F to 98°F,
heavy rainfall (as much as 400 inches annually), and high humidity (90 percent)
throughout the year.
           (1) Temperature/Humidity. Many tasks in the jungle take more time than in
other environments. When temperatures rise to the 85°F to 100°F range, personnel can
only continue medium or heavy workloads by reducing their MOPP level. Since
decontamination crews will be more susceptible to heat stress, leaders should plan for
frequent crew rotations and provide enough decontamination personnel to conduct
decontamination operations. Biological agents can persist in the heat, humidity, and
shade, which are characteristics of the jungle. Therefore, weathering is not a practical
means of biological decontamination. See Chapter II for information on work/rest cycles.
          (2) Rain. Tropical rainstorms will flood decontamination sites unless the sites
are adequately drained. Decontamination sites should be put on high ground during the
rainy season. Ground that appears firm may become impassable. Rain can help the
decontamination process by washing away contamination on exposed surfaces. Rain can
also hydrolyze some agents. However, runoff may contaminate the soil.
          (3) Terrain. Contamination will be retained temporarily in the jungle canopy,
reducing the immediate hazard. Later, rains will wash these particles to the ground and
concentrate them in low areas. These areas are likely to become contamination “hot spots.”
The thick vegetation can reduce sunlight and wind, increasing the persistency of some CB
agents.
         (4) Decontaminants. Solid decontaminants, such as STB powder, tend to cake
and decompose at a faster rate than in temperate climates. Caking is no problem, but the
decomposition eventually makes STB powder ineffective.
            (5) Lubricants. Frequently oil exposed metal parts and grease wheel bearings
to protect them from moisture. Since POL tends to absorb chemical agents, additional
decontamination may be needed. Measures taken to protect electronic communications
equipment from moisture may reduce the need for decontamination since these measures
provide good CBRN protection.

4.   Urban Areas
      The need for decontamination operations in urban areas may also exist, and it may be
easier to support. Water sources are generally available, and commercial chemicals may be
used as decontaminants. Decontamination operations in urban areas will not differ
significantly from similar operations in the field; however, keep the following
considerations in mind:
       a.   Structures. Wood and concrete tend to absorb liquid agents, and they may give
off toxic vapors for days or weeks. Building decontamination is very difficult and requires
large quantities of decontaminants. Covering the contamination with plastic sheets, STB
slurry, sodium silicate, or other substances that cover or absorb the agent can reduce the
hazard. Even though a particular part of a building is not intended for occupation, it may
still need to be decontaminated to prevent the contamination from spreading.
      b.    Streets and Sidewalks. Streets and sidewalks also absorb liquid agents and then
give off toxic vapors when heated by the sun. These surfaces may need to be
decontaminated several times to reduce hazards. Streets, sidewalks, or other porous
surfaces are best decontaminated by weathering if the time and the situation permit.
     c.    Sanitation Systems and Runoff. Urban areas may have sophisticated sanitation
systems. When those systems are destroyed, sanitary conditions become far worse than
those in areas where sanitation systems have never existed. Sanitation systems must be
maintained to avoid overloading decontamination capabilities. Contaminated water and
residue must be controlled so that it will not create a hazard. Support may be necessary to
construct controlled runoff areas.
5.   Mountains
     Excluding extremely high, Alpine type mountains, most mountain systems are
characterized by heavy woods or jungle, compartments and ridge systems, limited routes,
and highly variable weather conditions. All these factors will affect decontamination
operations.
     a.   Mobility. The terrain and the disruption of existing routes may dictate that
decontamination operations be decentralized. Additional water-carrying vehicles may be
needed to support decontamination. Forces must be organized to be self-sufficient and may
have decontamination elements attached to them initially. Decontamination elements
must be equipped with greater hauling capabilities, especially for water.
      b.   Weather. Although there is a general climatic correspondence between high
latitudes and high altitudes, there are factors that act as additional local variables that
may impact decontamination.
         (1) Wind. Mountains have changing weather and constant winds that promote
weathering at a faster rate.
            (2) Temperature. Cool or cold temperatures have an adverse effect on
decontamination operations. Air temperature drops about 6.5°C for each kilometer of rise
in altitude. The drier the air, the more pronounced the drop in temperatures. At high
altitudes, there may be differences of 40°F to 50°F between the temperature in the sun and
that in the shade. Low temperatures that normally exist at extremely high altitudes may
demand decontamination procedures and precautions similar to those used in cold-weather
operations. Daytime operations can be scheduled to avoid some low-temperature problems.

          (3) Sunlight. Increasing altitude results in increased sunlight because the air
becomes clearer as altitude increases. At high altitudes, exposed surfaces are heated much
more than they would be in the lowlands. The clearer air also results in a greater loss of
heat by radiation at night. Sunlight destroys most biological agents.
     c.    Altitude. The body must adjust to the lower air pressure at high altitudes.
These adjustments take time. As much as 70 percent of sea level work capacity may be
attained after months in a high-altitude environment by acclimatized personnel.
Practically all unacclimatized personnel can be expected to show some altitude effects
above 2,100 meters.

                                        Appendix G 

                  DECONTAMINATION UNITS AND ASSETS 


1.   Background
     This appendix contains basic information on service decontamination capabilities.
2.   Army
     This paragraph describes the organizational structure, mission, capabilities,
limitations, C2, and basis of allocation of Army CBRN units that have a decontamination
capability. The basis of allocation is determined by the number and type of units being
supported, and capabilities are available at brigade and battalion level to provide C2 of
subordinate unit decontamination assets.
     a.   Chemical Brigade. The chemical brigade commander, with the advice of his staff
and in conjunction with the theater/corps/JTF chemical section, evaluates and determines
the chemical unit support requirement for the supported commander. The brigade
commander advises his higher commander concerning the employment of CBRN
decontamination units.
          (1) Mission. Provide C2 of two to six battalions and other assigned or attached
separate companies.
           (2)   Capabilities.
          •    Provide C2, and supervise the operation of the brigade and two to six
subordinate chemical battalions or separate companies.
            •    Plan and coordinate for the combat, combat support, and CSS operations
for all assigned and attached units.
           •     Allocate units and resources to conduct CBRN decontamination.
           •     Provide necessary logistical and administrative support to the brigade HQ.
           •     Provide organizational level maintenance to the brigade HQ.
           (3)   C2 HQ. Normally supports a theater, corps, or JTF.
           (4)   Basis of Allocation. One per corps and one per theater support command
(TSC).
     b.    Chemical Battalion. There are many different organizations that a chemical
battalion can support. The nonenhanced chemical battalion may support a corps or larger
sided AO. Smaller scale operations may require the chemical battalion to work directly for
a JTF. In all situations, the chemical battalion commander, in conjunction with the
supported unit chemical staff, will develop the CBRN decontamination plan according to
METT-TC considerations. The functions and responsibilities of the chemical battalion are
usually constant but will depend on the command and support relationship given it by the
higher HQ.
           (1)   Mission. Provide C2 of two to five chemical companies.
           (2)   Capabilities.

3.    Marine Corps
      The USMC NBC defense teams consist of personnel trained in NBC decontamination
and NBC reconnaissance in support of USMC MAGTF operations. NBC decontamination
teams are formed primarily at the company level from assigned personnel with oversight
and supervision provided by NBC specialists (MOS 5711/5702) at the battalion level and
higher. NBC defense teams at the company level may be reinforced by the attachment of
other company teams as directed by the senior commander. Positioning NBC defense
teams at the company, squadron, and battalion levels allows the USMC to task-organize its
NBC decontamination and reconnaissance elements/assets across the MAGTF, depending
on the situation and mission.

       a. Decontamination Teams. Decontamination teams are the backbone of the
MAGTF decontamination capability. Teams are trained and equipped in a manner that
facilitates task organization and are tailored towards specific decontamination operations.
These decontamination teams are capable of rapid employment through the use of organic
vehicles that have been dedicated to the teams. Teams are force-multiplied to support
sustained operations.

            (1) Major Subordinate Command (MSC) Decontamination Teams. Each MSC
has a decontamination team comprised of NBC defense specialists that is task-organized as
required to support MAGTF operations. The team organization is based upon providing one
decontamination section for each MSC civil engineer (CE), regiment, Marine aircraft group
(MAG), and five for each force service support group (FSSG). Each section is staffed with
one section leader and three section members. Teams are task-organized to perform their
operational decontamination missions based on mission requirements and the commander’s
priorities. The nuclear, biological, and chemical center (NBCC) operations coordinator will
direct the task organization and employment and will coordinate the support for the team.
The actual common operating environment (COE) will be based upon the vulnerability
analysis and adjusted as required to respond to the enemy’s use of NBC agents. Each
operational decontamination section is trained and equipped to support casualty
decontamination, MOPP drop, MOPP gear exchange, and vehicle/aircraft wash down.
           (2) Subordinate Command Decontamination Teams. All battalions and
squadrons that function as an integral unit during combat operations are trained and
equipped to support casualty decontamination, MOPP drop, MOPP gear exchange, and
vehicle/aircraft wash down. Team members come from the unit command element. Teams
task-organize to perform their operational decontamination missions based on mission
requirements and the commander’s priorities. Decontamination teams provide the
commander with the ability to—
         •    Prepare contaminated casualties for transport to a casualty
decontamination site by removing as much contamination from the casualty as possible.
          •    Conduct MOPP drop.
          •    Conduct MOPP exchange.
          •    Conduct vehicle/aircraft wash down.
          •    Provide site workers for thorough/clearance and casualty decontamination
operations.

         (3) USMC NBC Decontamination Teams. The USMC NBC decontamination
teams may also be task-organized in support of the following decontamination operations:
                (a) Patient (Casualty) Decontamination. Casualty decontamination is
conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in this manual and MCRP 4-11.1F.
Each MSC maintains a capability set with sufficient supplies and materials to set up one
casualty decontamination site (CDS) that is capable of decontaminating 100 casualties.
The decontamination team/section will require additional personnel augmentation to set up
and sustain operations at the CDS. This augmentation will consist of any available USMC
(CDS workers) and medical personnel who are familiar with triage and the treatment of
casualties with conventional and CBRN agent injuries. Personnel working on the CDS will
be rotated in accordance with the work rates and work/rest cycles contained in Multiservice
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection.
Medical personnel required to support the CDS will be task-organized based on mission
requirements and the commander’s priorities. The shock trauma platoons located in the
medical battalion are ideally suited for supporting the CDS. The MAGTF NBCC will direct
the establishment of at least one CDS whenever the vulnerability analysis indicates the
likelihood of encountering CBRN contamination. MSCs will establish additional CDSs in
those instances when the single MAGTF site does not adequately support their
decontamination needs. The personnel used to man the CDS will conduct MOPP drop to
remove their CBRN IPE prior to crossing the contamination control line (hot line) or
entering any clean area.
              b. Thorough Decontamination. The MAGTF is prepared to conduct
thorough decontamination of its vehicles, equipment, DED, aircraft, and DAD. Personnel
decontamination will be accomplished primarily by using the MOPP drop and/or the MOPP
gear exchange procedures identified in this publication.
               (1) The MAGTF decontamination elements are structured and equipped in
a manner that provides a flexible capability. Operational decontamination will be used to
support the high OPTEMPO associated with FP. Thorough decontamination will be
conducted in support of retrograde operations or as required to support unusual
circumstances.
                 (2) The MAGTF CE CBRN operations coordinator will organize and
coordinate thorough decontamination operations. The MSC and subordinate command
operational decontamination teams, medical personnel, engineers, and other augmentees
are task-organized as required to support the MAGTF thorough decontamination
operations. The divisions and FSSGs will each maintain a capability set with sufficient
supplies and materials to set up one DED that is capable of decontaminating 100 medium
tactical vehicle replacements (MTVRs) (7-ton) each. The wings will maintain a capability
set with sufficient supplies and materials to set up one DAD capable of decontaminating
100 aircraft (Marine attack squadron [VMA]/Marine light/attack helicopter squadron
[HMLA]).
               (3) All vehicles, equipment, and aircraft must be checked for
contamination during retrograde operations. Contaminated vehicles, equipment and
aircraft must go through thorough (clearance) decontamination operations.

      c. MAGTF NBCC. The MAGTF NBCC will task-organize decontamination teams
as required to support the following operations:
                •   Terrain decontamination.
                •   Fixed-site decontamination.
                •   Sensitive-equipment decontamination.
                •   DU decontamination
                •   Contaminated-remains decontamination.
     d. USMC Chemical/Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF). The CBIRF was
established by the direction of the Commandant of the USMC as a result of Presidential
Decision Directive 39 (PDD-39), which states that the United States shall give the highest
priority to developing the capability to manage the consequences of NBC materials or
weapons use by terrorists.
           (1) Mission. When directed, the CBIRF forward-deploys domestically or
overseas in order to provide FP and/or mitigation in the event of a WMD incident. CBIRF is
prepared to respond to no-notice WMD incidents with a rapidly deployable initial-response
force (IRF) and follow-on forces (FOF) if required. CBIRF also conducts FP training for
Fleet Marine Force units.
           (2) Organizational Structure. The CBIRF is composed of 350 to 375 USMC and
USN personnel and consists of three elements. In garrison, the CBIRF is under the
operational control (OPCON) and administrative control (ADCON) of the 4th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade Antiterrorism (4th MEB/AT) who falls under the II Marine
Expeditionary Force (II MEF) and USMC Forces, Atlantic (MARFORLANT). The CBIRF is
an incident response force that executes CM operations in support of a combatant
commander or lead federal agency. The CBIRF has limited organic equipment
decontamination capability, but does not conduct DED or area decontamination operations.
Further, the majority of CBIRF personnel are trained in Level A and B operations. TIC and
TIM are potential threats to US forces, even OCONUS, since littoral areas include port and
industrial complexes where the storage and manufacture of these materials are common.
The CBIRF also has state-of-the-art monitoring and detection equipment used to identify,
sample, and analyze NBC hazards, including TIC and TIM, as well as oxygen (O2) and
lower-explosive levels (LEL).
          (3)   Command Element.
          •     Provides liaison teams to other agencies or commands.
          •     Interfaces with local and military commanders.
          •     Coordinates all on-site CBIRF operations.
          •     Establishes data/voice reach-back to scientific and medical advisors.
          •     Prepares CBR plume models.
          (4)   Reaction Force Company Capabilities.
          •     Agent detection and identification.
          •     Sampling and collection.

           •     Decontamination of 65 to 75 nonambulatory casualties per hour.
           •     Mobile laboratory.
4.   Air Force
      This paragraph provides an overview of the USAF CBRN structure and
decontamination response capabilities.
     a.   AB CBRN Defense Capabilities. USAF CBRN forces are structured to support
AB survivability and operations. Each AB has one central focal point for CBRN defense,
the CE readiness flight (office symbol CEX), which is contained in the CE squadron.
Representative decontamination related functions include—
   •    Conducting CBRN defense training for all USAF personnel and training unit
CBRN teams (contamination control, shelter management).
     •     Developing base CBRN defense plans and procedures.
     •     Advising the commander on all nonmedical aspects of CBRN defense.
     •     Establishing personnel CCAs.

          (1) CBRN defense actions require a force structure that includes both primary
duty and base augmentation forces. Primary duty CBRN defense forces are located within
the CE squadron readiness flight.
           (2) In-place and deployed units provide augmentation manpower for CCTs and
CCA teams. Deliberate planning guidelines for identifying specialist and augmentation
support for NBCC defense are found in AFI 10-204. The installation, theater, or USAF
planning agent determines the actual requirements after considering the threat and
missions for each in-place and deployed location.
     b.    AB NBC Defense Structure. The AB NBC defense structure includes a defined
C2 structure and CONOPS for wartime operations. The host wing commander sets alarm
conditions, MOPP levels, and FP conditions for the entire base. The survival recovery
center (SRC) is the (base) command post element that develops, recommends, implements
(with wing approval), and tracks pre-, during-, and postattack passive-defense activities on
the base. The SRC broadcasts alarm conditions and MOPP exchanges to all units on base,
activates the base siren, tracks casualties and damage to installation resources, and directs
recovery efforts. The SRC tracks the location of all known postattack hazards on the base.
      c.   Unit Control Center (UCC). The next level down in the command structure,
below the SRC, is the UCC. It monitors the status of unit activities and maintains a log of
unit actions. The UCC passes information to and from the SRC, and it directs and monitors
the implementation of unit pre-, during-, and postattack actions. UCCs maintain a base
map with all unit structures, shelters, bunkers, and primary operating areas color-coded or
marked to enable quick identification. UCC checklists outline tasks and responsible unit
functions under each alarm condition. Following attacks, the UCC directs (in coordination
with the SRC) and reports postattack hazards to the SRC and coordinates recovery actions.
     d.    UCC Capabilities. UCCs track the location of all known postattack hazards that
may affect their unit personnel or mission. This includes hazards such as contamination
and unexploded ordnance (UXO). The UCC advises unit personnel of hazard locations and
directs the movement of unit assets away from hazard areas. If the base uses the NBC
sector or zone concept, the UCC tracks the alarm condition and MOPP for the sectors/zones
and controls movement of unit resources into and out of the contaminated areas.
     e.     Deployable Teams. Within the USAF, deployable teams with a decontamination
capability (see Table G-1) are organized under unit type codes (UTCs). UTCs prescribe
specific team support for a given contingency. Within this concept, trained individuals are
deployed for assignment to these teams when the need arises. The teams have multiple
capabilities.

      f.   Casualty Decontamination. The decontamination of casualties protects them
from the detrimental effects of contamination and protects those who move and treat them.
Units and individuals have the responsibility for immediate decontamination during the
self-aid buddy care (SABC) process (i.e., use of M291 and M295 decontamination kits). This
should be done as soon as contamination is found and prior to moving casualties to the
medical facility; quick action saves lives. Upon completion of SABC efforts, units should
move contaminated casualties into the medical treatment system as soon as possible, even
if decontamination is not complete. The MTF will plan for and provide patient
decontamination depending on the local threat conditions. The wartime patient
decontamination team provides this capability and may be deployed, depending on the NBC
threat. Medical units without a patient decontamination team may need to establish a
decontamination capability using personnel and material of opportunity. Commanders at
the employment location may need to provide manpower augmentation to the medical unit

in the event of insufficient medical resources. Ambulatory personnel with no significant
symptoms should process through unit or area CCAs for decontamination whenever
practical. Patient decontamination resources are limited and are best-suited for personnel
in need of medical care. See Table G-2 for a synopsis of CE and CBRN decontamination
capabilities.

5.     Navy
     This paragraph provides an overview of USN decontamination CBRD capabilities and
organization.
       a.   Afloat. CBRD is coordinated aboard each ship according to the specific CBRD
bill for that ship. The responsibility for the CBRD normally rests with the damage control
officer, who organizes the CBRD team. Personnel are assigned to operate decontamination
stations as designated by the damage control officer.
    b.  Ashore. Disaster preparedness teams are established by the naval shore activity
commanding officer. CBRD decontamination teams consist of the following assets:
         (1) CBR Survey Team. Surveys the assigned areas to determine CBR
contamination locations and levels and marks hazardous areas.
         (2) Personnel Decontamination Team. Conducts chemical and radiological
decontamination of personnel who are not seriously injured.

         (3) Facilities and Area Decontamination Team. Is responsible for performing
CBR decontamination of essential facilities and areas.
         (4) Radiation Monitor Team. Provides radiation monitoring capability and
equipment to personnel performing rescue, first aid, and firefighting.
          (5) Dosimetry Team. Determines the radiation dosage of personnel by reading
dosimeters and recording readings.
          (6) Clothing Decontamination Team. Retrieves contaminated clothing from
personnel decontamination stations and determines its reusability. Delivers clothing to
decontamination stations and returns it to the clothing supply team.
          (7) Nuclear Accident Team. Provides assistance to the on-scene commander
and performs emergency actions that may be necessary to minimize the initial results of a
nuclear accident/incident.
            (8) Shelter Management Team. Provides the orderly administration of all
activities related to the comfort and welfare of all inhabitants of an assigned shelter.
6.     Other Units
     Selected units, such as USA reserve component CBRN units, are equipped with
additional resources to support casualty decontamination requirements. The mission of
these units is to provide a domestic response capability for casualty decontamination in
support of CM operations.
     a.   These units are equipped with a platoon set of domestic response style
equipment (see Table G-3, page G-12) to decontaminate both ambulatory and
nonambulatory casualties. The set includes a quickly erectable tent with runoff
containment included for the actual decontamination, two other tents for sun protection for
the workers and victims, showers for washing and rinsing, and rollers for decontaminating
nonambulatory victims.

     b.    USA reserve units, while designed for overseas deployment, have the capability
to provide domestic-response casualty decontamination (DRCD) in support of CM. These
units are not designed or intended to replace functions carried out under the ICS or
functions normally performed by the emergency first-responder community. Instead, these
units provide additional capability as needed to support CM. They are not designed for a
rapid response, but can be mobilized and deployed within days. The basic functions
performed by these units include the following:
        •    Receive the mission, activate the mobilization plan, and initiate unit movement.
        •    Conduct mission assessment to develop a force packet.
        •    Coordinate unit movement and deployment.
        •    Conduct liaison operations.
        •    Conduct staging operations.
        •    Conduct incident integration operations.
        •    Conduct decontamination site selection, parameters, and setup.

     DECONTAMINATION KITS, APPARATUSES, AND EQUIPMENT

1.    Background
     Table H-1 lists the decontamination equipment and materials, and Table H-2 (page
H-2) lists detection equipment and materials. Various materials and equipment are used in
decontamination operations. Some are simple to use and are readily available to personnel.
Others are very complex to use and are available only to specially trained teams.

2.    Decontamination Devices for Personnel
     Decontamination devices for personnel are the warfighter’s first defense against
contamination on the skin. They are an integral part of immediate decontamination.
      a.     M291 SDK.
             (1)    Users: All services and components.
            (2) Description. The M291 kit (Figure H-1) consists of six identical packets
that contain a mixture of activated resins. This resin mixture adsorbs and neutralizes
liquid chemical agents present on an individual’s skin and neutralizes agents. The mixture
consists of an adsorbent resin, a resin containing sulfonic acid, and a hydroxylamine-
containing resin. The black powder residue will provide a visual confirmation of the
thoroughness of application and will not cause any skin irritation even after prolonged
contact with skin. However, normal precautions must be observed so that the powder does
not enter open wounds, the mouth, or the eyes. This kit will also be used for training; no
training aid will be produced. The issue is 20 M291 SDKs per box.
           (3) Mission. The M291 is used to decontaminate the skin, mask hood, and
protective gloves. After masking, the individual opens a packet from the kit, removes the
applicator pad, and applies an even coating of resin powder while scrubbing the entire skin
area suspected to be contaminated.
            (4) Capabilities. One applicator pad will decontaminate both hands and the
face if necessary. If the face must be decontaminated, the neck (including the throat area)
and the ears must also be decontaminated using a second applicator pad. The black powder
resin will provide a visual confirmation of the thoroughness of application and will not
cause any skin irritation even after prolonged contact with skin.

     b.    RSDL.
           (1)   Users. All services and components.
           (2) Description. RSDL is a broad-spectrum liquid CW agent decontaminant
that will remove and destroy military chemical agents on contact. After CW agent
destruction, RSDL leaves a nontoxic residue that may be washed off with water. It does not
need to be removed immediately. RSDL is safe for use on all intact skin surfaces and for
limited duration use in the eyes. RSDL reacts rapidly, providing the full removal and
destruction of CW agents within 2 minutes, enabling efficient decontamination of
casualties. The RSDL kit is fielded with three kits per package.
         (3) Mission. The RSDL is used to decontaminate intact skin only. It is
impregnated in a sponge pad and packaged as a single unit in a heat-sealed foil pouch.
When exposed to CW agents, the user wipes the exposed skin with the lotion.
           (4) Capabilities. RSDL acts within seconds of being applied to the skin,
neutralizing the toxicity of chemical agents by breaking down their molecules. Apply the
lotion within 1 minute of contamination. The lotion is effective against cutaneous nerve
and blister agents, such as mustard, GB, and VX.
3.   Decontamination Devices for Equipment
    Decontamination devices are used for all levels of equipment decontamination (e.g.,
immediate, operational, and thorough).
     a.    M295 IEDK.
           (1)   Users. All services and components.
           (2) Description. The M295 kit (see Figure H-2, page H-6) provides a means to
decontaminate individual equipment through physical removal and absorption of chemical
agents, with no long-term harmful side effects. The M295 consists of four individual
wipe-down mitts—each enclosed in a protective packet. Each wipe-down mitt consists of a
decontaminating powder contained within a pad material. When used, the sorbent powder
from the mitt flows freely through the pad material. The M295 allows for the
decontamination of individual equipment, such as gloves, footwear, weapon, helmet, and
LBE through physical removal and sorption of chemical agents. The residue of the powder

shows where the powder has been used or, more importantly, what areas have not been

         (3) Mission. The M295 kit is used to decontaminate the individual’s personal
equipment (i.e. protective gloves, mask, hood, NBC overboots, helmet, LBE, and weapon).
Each packet consists of a decontamination mitt filled with 22 grams of the decontaminant
compound, 20 M295 kits are packed in a fiberboard-shipping container.
      b.   M100 SDS.
           (1)   Users: All services and components.
           (2) Description. The M100 SDS (Figure H-3) uses a reactive sorbent powder to
remove and neutralize chemical agents from surfaces. The use of the M100 SDS decreases
decontamination time and eliminates the need for water. Each M100 SDS consists of two
0.7-pound packs of reactive sorbent powder, two wash mitt type sorbent applicators, a case,
straps, and detailed instructions. An optional chemical-resistant mounting bracket is also
available. The sorbent decontamination system provides a simple, rapid, and efficient
system to decontaminate small and individual issue items. The sorbent is used during the
operator’s wipe-down portion of immediate decontamination on surfaces that personnel
must touch or contact to operate the equipment, such as door handles, crew-served
weapons, etc. The sorbent powder is applied to the mitt or flat surfaces prior to
decontaminating. The M100 SDS is not classified as a hazardous material and, therefore,
can be shipped through normal transport processes.
         (3) Mission. The M100 replaces the M11/M13 DAP and associated
decontamination solution number 2 (DS2) used in operator wipe down (immediate
decontamination) with a reactive, neutralizing sorbent powder.

     c.    M12A1 Power-Driven Decontamination Apparatus.
           (1)   Users. USA.
           (2) Description. The M12A1 consists of a 500-gallon tank, a pumper unit, and
an M2 water heater. Each unit is mounted on a skid base. Power for operating the
equipment is supplied by the pump unit, which uses a 20-horsepower military standard
gasoline or diesel engine to drive a centrifugal pump and a 28-volt direct current generator.
The M2 water heater is electrically connected through a main power cable to a generator in
the pump unit. A personnel shower assembly stowed on the tank unit in disassembled form
can be readily assembled in varying configurations to shower up to 24 personnel at one
time.
         (3) Mission. The M12A1 is used to support thorough, operational, and terrain
decontamination missions.
           (4)   Capabilities. The M12A1—
                 (a)   Is used to spray water, STB slurry, and other decontaminants.
                 (b)   May be used for firefighting and spraying water.
     d.    Fixed-Site Decontamination System (FSDS).
           (1)   Users. USA.
           (2)   Description.
               (a) The FSDS (Figure H-6, page H-10) is a compressed-air,
foam-generating system, consisting of a pump and bulk decontaminant tank that can be


4 April 2006              FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60            H-9
mounted on a commercial vehicle or trailer. The system may be used in three different
modes: a spray bar is mounted at the rear of the trailer for terrain decontamination, a deck
gun is mounted in the truck bed for fixed-site equipment and facility decontamination, and
a foam dispensing nozzle with a 100-foot spray hose is mounted on the trailer for direct
decontaminant application and to supplement deck gun operations.
NOTE: Decontaminant in “foam” form is not authorized for use at this time. DF
200 is currently approved for CENTCOM use only.




                           Figure H-6. FSDS Placed in a Civilian Vehicle
                 (b)     The systems primary decontaminant is DF 200.
           (3) Mission. The primary function of the FSDS is to provide a decontamination
capability for APODs and SPODs. The system also provides the capability to perform
decontamination on main supply routes (MSRs), vehicles, equipment, and aircraft.
Inherent in the mission to decontaminate APODs and SPODs is the requirement to
decontaminate staging areas, runways, roads, buildings, and container expresses
(CONEXs). Each of these areas requires different approaches, configurations, and planning
factors. (See paragraph 5 for the TTP to support FSDS operations.)
           (4)   Capabilities. The FSDS provides—
                 •     Mobile terrain decontamination.
                 •     Fixed-site and facility decontamination.
                 •     Equipment decontamination.
5.     Fixed-Site Decontamination System Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
     Three individuals (supervisor, driver, and spray cannon/wand operator) man the
system. The system has three modes of operation: spray bar at the rear of the trailer, deck
gun on the truck bed, and 100-foot spray hose on the trailer. Only one mode of operation is
possible at one time. To decontaminate horizontal surfaces (staging areas, docks, and
roads) the rear spray bar is the primary mode of operation. To decontaminate buildings,
structures, and containers, the deck gun is the primary mode. The spray hose will be used




H-10                     FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60    4 April 2006
to augment the deck gun and also will be available for smaller areas, vehicles, and aircraft
and to perform self-decontamination of the system.
      The primary decontaminant is DF 200. DF 200 is supplied as a three-part solution:
Part A, Part B and Part C activator. The system is configured with a trailer that contains
three separate storage tanks for the solution. There are two 500-gallon tanks, one each for
Parts A and B, and a 30-gallon tank for Part C. Tank C pours directly into Tank B so
activation occurs prior to mixing of Parts A and B. Tank C should be released prior to
movement in order for Parts B and C to get mixed well. The system mixes the solutions as
it operates and, therefore, premixing of the solutions is not required. The system can be
filled and standing ready without the need to perform the loading after the mission is
received. This allows for a quick response when a mission must be performed.
     a.    Mission Receipt.
           (1) The planner determines the surface composition of the contaminated area
in order to determine the effects on the mission (i.e., absorption and desorption rate,
reaction of surface with decontaminant, concerns of contaminant transfer due to
uncontrolled runoff).
          (2) The planner determines the extent of the contamination in order to identify
the quantity of required decontamination applicators. Table H-3 identifies the capability of
one system with a 1,000-gallon load of DF 200. The planner also determines the extent of
the contamination, which will determine the resupply quantities required.
                 Table H-3. Typical Mission Parameters (1,000 gallons of DF 200)

          Contaminated Areas              Time          Speed               Coverage

   Roads, runways, and staging areas   18 minutes   2–3 mph        25,000 square feet

           (3) The planner identifies any additional requirements (i.e., additional pumps,
detectors, and nonstandard equipment).
          (4) The planner assesses the weather conditions (temperature, precipitation,
and winds) and determines how they may affect the mission. The assessment will also
evaluate whether the mission must be adjusted based on the conditions. For example,
extreme heat may cause the contaminant to dissipate faster than a thorough
decontamination operation can be completed, so a limited area may be decontaminated to
maintain operations until weathering effects are complete.
          (5)   The planner determines the entry and exit routes. The locations of the
routes depend on factors such as the locations of the contamination and the threat.
Additionally, multiple start points may be used because two FSDSs can be used at the same
time.
           (6) The planner determines support requirements (e.g., engineer, logistical,
security, and other assets) needed to safely complete the mission.
     b.    Mission Preparation.
           (1)    Dispatch resupply vehicles, and coordinate the supply linkup location.
          (2) Determine IPE requirements, and request resupply quantities of all IPE
and other expendable items and equipment.

       c.   Precombat Checks.
           (1) Individual Equipment. Inspect IPE, to include M40 protective mask and
filter, BDO or JSLIST, overboots, gloves, wet-weather gear, and TAP aprons.
            (2)   FSDS. Conduct preventive-maintenance checks and services (PMCS), and
fill fuel and decontaminant tanks. Load Tank A with Solution A, or load Tank B with
Solution B, and fill Tank C with the fortifier. Ensure that the washer fluid reservoir is
topped off, and load extra wiper fluid and wiper blades. Also ensure that wet wipes are on
board for the gunner to use to wipe DF 200 residue off his protective mask eye lenses.
           (3) Weapons. Ensure that all individual and crew-served weapons are
serviceable and that ammunition has been issued to all personnel.
           (4) Communications System of the FSDS. Ensure that PMCS has been
performed on all communications systems. Obtain call signs and frequencies, and load
communications security into all systems. If nonsecure communication devices are used
(handheld, etc.), make communications checks with all personnel. Radios must have
earpieces and microphones that can operate under the mask hood. The primary
communications contact in a vehicle must be the driver; the vehicle commander, once
dismounted, will not have access to interior communications systems.
          (5) Convoy Route. Brief all personnel on the convoy route and the type of road
march to be conducted.
          (6)    Support Requirements. Ensure that any external support elements are
integrated into the mission (e.g., security).
         (7) Coordination. Although the FSDS has the ability to decontaminate itself,
decontamination support may have to be coordinated to ensure that the FSDSs are
decontaminated thoroughly upon completion of the assigned mission in preparation for
subsequent missions.
       d.   Mission Execution.
           (1) As the systems depart the starting point, the fortifier in Tank C will be
released into Tank B. During the convoy, the fortifier will be thoroughly mixed with
Solution B. When the squad reaches the RP, the DF 200 will be ready for decontamination
operations.
           (2) Upon arrival at the identified site, the FSDS supervisor will direct the
driver to stop prior to entering the contaminated area and will start the FSDS in the
trailer. Once the supervisor and the spray operator exit the vehicle and the mission starts,
they will not reenter the vehicle until the unit has been decontaminated. They should don
either TAP aprons or wet-weather gear prior to entering the contaminated area.
          (3) The FSDS will proceed down the road/MSR at approximately 2 to 3 miles
per hour while the spray bar dispenses DF 200. The driver will place the vehicle in four-
wheel drive, low and allow the vehicle to move while idling.
            (4) Any obstacles encountered while conducting spray operations (vehicles,
debris, etc.) will also be sprayed with decontamination solution so that they may be safely
removed after the contamination has been neutralized. The operator at the system controls
may have to stop the vehicle, turn off the spray bar, and spray this equipment with the




H-12                  FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60        4 April 2006
hose or deck gun. If two systems are available, one may be used to spray the equipment
and obstacles while the second is used to spray surfaces.
           (5) The contamination will be approached from the upwind direction, and the
area will be decontaminated in 10-feet-wide slices. Multiple systems may work in tandem,
each covering a 10-foot swath, ensuring that the swaths overlap and result in full coverage.
Since the system operates at a slow speed (2 to 3 mph), the driver must maintain close
attention to the trailer. If the spray pattern does not overlap, the contamination will
remain. The slow speed increases the time it takes to return to the correct pattern. For
example, Figure H-7 indicates two systems conducting terrain decontamination.

                 (a) When operating in tandem, the drivers must ensure that spray
patterns overlap. Driving the low speed required can cause the vehicle to drift, and if full
overlap is not obtained, the area not covered must be resprayed. The vehicle supervisor or
gunner should walk alongside the vehicle as it proceeds and ensure that overlap occurs by
communicating the progress to the driver. Figure H-8 (page H-14) shows FSDS operations
conducting terrain decontamination operations that overlap.

                 (b) The CBRN decontamination unit must establish an overwatch
position and control decontamination operations. The decontamination control point (DCP)
(Figure H-9) is the primary location to observe progress and control resupply operations.
Since all contaminated situations are different, the leadership can determine if planned
resupply operations will be sufficient to complete the mission.

this case, multiple vehicles will reduce the time it takes to complete decontamination.
Resupply vehicles should remain upwind of the contaminated area. Figure H-10
demonstrates how resupply vehicles will approach the hazard area and not cross into that
area.

     e.    Resupply COAs.
           (1) Option 1. Five-ton or larger trucks drop totes (i.e., supplies) at a hot line
near the contaminated area. This method should be used primarily if a good estimate of
the amount of decontaminant needed can be determined.

            (2) Option 2. A 5-ton truck with a forklift conducts a tank exchange at a hot
line. Another forklift would be needed at the supply issue point. This method can be used
if unit leadership feels that there may be a need for resupply during the mission. Resupply
for the system should be conducted in such a manner that the supply vehicles remain clean.
The supply vehicles move to the resupply point located upwind of the contaminated area. A
hot line will be established, and supply vehicles will not move downwind from that line.
Totes will be dropped based on the estimated requirements determined during a recon of
the contaminated area. Once the mission is completed, resupply trucks, hoses, and totes
will be contaminated and will need to be decontaminated. If accurate estimates of DF 200
requirements can be made, the DF 200 can be pre-positioned and the resupply trucks
should not need decontamination.
     f.   Large-Area Missions. Large-area missions (such as airfields, staging areas,

runways. Decontamination personnel will recon the area and develop a plan to cover the
contaminated surfaces with decontamination solution as depicted in Figure H-11 (page H­

          (1) Interior decontamination of the vehicle should begin immediately upon
completion of the mission. Interior seat covers and other interior covers must be removed
and bagged as contaminated waste. If a crew member exits the vehicle, he should not
reenter the interior until the mission is complete. This prevents the spread of
contamination. If the crew member must reenter the vehicle, the SDS kit should be used to
decontaminate gloves, boots, and contact areas.
           (2) When all contaminated areas have been decontaminated, the FSDS will
move toward the hot line at the upwind location of the contamination and commence
standard equipment and troop decontamination operations. A thorough equipment
decontamination and DTD site will be established, and all equipment and soldiers will
process through the site.
NOTE: It has not been determined if a complete decontamination of the truck is
possible.
          (3)    Security personnel must ensure that all access to the contaminated area is
denied until sufficient contact time between the decontaminant and contaminant is
achieved to guarantee the neutralization of the agent. Security personnel will remain
upwind of the contamination and restrict entry until the area is determined to be
uncontaminated. Following a mission, the FSDS hoses should be purged and all tanks
drained.
          (4) The unit should prepare an NBC4 report and send it to higher HQ and
adjacent units.

                         TERRAIN DECONTAMINATION 


1.   Background
      a.   Most terrain surfaces (excluding unpainted metal and glass) absorb agents.
Thus, an agent may be transferred to clothing or skin by physical contact. The agent may
also be transferred through vaporization and subsequent inhalation or diffusion into eyes
and clothing. The decontamination of terrain allows personnel to increase stay time in an
area and provides passage through an area. Large-scale terrain decontamination requires
extensive amounts of equipment, material, and time. Thus, terrain decontamination is
limited to areas of critical importance. Contaminated areas that can be avoided need no
decontamination other than weathering. If they must be used, decontamination may be
necessary. Wear PPE or IPE when decontamination is not practical.
      b.    Terrain decontamination may be accomplished using several methods. The most
effective techniques for terrain decontamination are the natural methods (weathering or
aging). Using standard decontaminants should be a last resort. It will quickly exhaust
your resources. Usually, the most practical method is to scrape contaminated surfaces.
Fire is an acceptable method; however, consideration must be given to the potential
downwind vapor hazard. If possible, a contaminated area should be evacuated until time
and weather remove the contaminant. STB slurry can be used for vital areas.
      c.    Terrain decontamination provides more long-term than short-term benefit.
Generally, terrain cannot be decontaminated well enough to allow a reduction of MOPP
level right away. At best, the decontamination process may help speed the weathering
process. Terrain decontamination can be so expensive and so ineffective that the
commander may consider not doing it.
      d.   If the commander decides to conduct terrain decontamination, a limited amount
will probably be conducted. Planning may result in building a causeway or breaching a
path through the contamination for entry or exit into a major facility. Movement
restriction will apply to those personnel who must work. Remain in MOPP. If possible, the
contaminated area should be evacuated.
2.   Terrain Decontamination Methods
       There are various methods for terrain decontamination. The type of contamination
present will determine the decontamination method used. These methods are listed in the
order of decreasing effectiveness. Although terrain decontamination can reduce the contact
hazard, terrain decontamination will probably not prevent hazardous vapors desorbing
from chemically contaminated surfaces. Therefore, appropriate protective measures must
still be taken.
     a.    Weathering. Weathering is the simplest and easiest form of decontamination.
           (1) CB Contamination. Warm, windy weather can significantly reduce terrain
contamination. In some cases, this occurs in a few hours, but it may take a few days. Many
variables affect the persistency of CB hazards, so it is impossible to accurately predict how
long it takes CB contamination to weather. Sunlight is especially effective against most
biological agents.


4 April 2006            FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60               I-1
           (2) Radiological Contamination. Although the term “weathering” is used to
describe the decontamination process, weather has little effect on radiological hazards.
Heavy rain and wind may remove some contamination, but only time will reduce the
radiation emanating from the contamination.
      b.   Removing or Covering. Removing or covering contamination does not destroy it,
but it does keep the hazards away temporarily.
           (1) CB Contamination. Contamination can be removed from paths and
unpaved roadways by scraping off a layer of earth with heavy earthmoving equipment
(bulldozers and road graders). Contaminated paths and paved surfaces can be covered with
a 4-inch layer of earth, roofing paper, plastic sheets, or wood mats. This is a temporary
measure because the agents may penetrate the covering. When the contamination
penetrates the covering or when the covering is removed, the hazards will reappear. The
coverings may also extend the life of the contamination hazard by reducing its exposure to
air and sunlight.
           (2) Radiological Contamination. Radiological contamination must be covered
by thick layers of dense material (e.g., earth). Three inches of earth will decrease radiation
dose rates by half because of the shielding provided by the soil; however, 12 inches is more
effective. The job will be easier with earthmoving equipment, but the equipment and
operators must undergo decontamination.
     c.  Neutralizing. The STB dry mix or STB slurry may be used effectively against
CB contamination, but not against radiological contamination. Trained personnel and
equipment are required when using the STB slurry, which is costly in time and material.
            (1) CB Contamination. The STB dry mix is spread on solid surfaces and raked
into soft surfaces like sand or earth. The STB slurry is applied to terrain by using a spray
hose that is attached to an M12A1 PDDA. Operators wear TAP aprons over their MOPP
gear and sit on the front fenders of a vehicle to spray the STB slurry. The speed of the
vehicle should be adjusted according to the terrain; this is normally 2 to 4 miles per hour.
The operators spray a fan pattern 3 to 5 feet ahead of the vehicle. The pattern overlaps on
the center and extends past both sides of the vehicle. The STB slurry forms a seal over the
surface and must be renewed periodically due to deterioration from traffic or weathering.
One load of STB slurry will decontaminate a concrete surface about 328 by 33 feet. Other
surfaces may require more decontaminants. It takes about an hour to load and mix one
load of STB slurry.
            (2) Radiological Contamination. The STB dry mix and STB slurry have no
effect on radiological contamination or its hazards.
     d.   Burning. Burning works well against CB-contaminated vegetation, but it is of no
value against radiological contamination.
           (1) CB Contamination. Fuel may be used to burn grass or short undergrowth.
Burning also works on dirt surfaces. Soak the area with diesel fuel, kerosene, or fuel oil
and ignite remotely. Do not use gasoline; it burns too quickly. Burning will cause vapor
hazards downwind, and protective measures will have to be used by downwind units. Area
commanders must warn these units of the vapor hazards.
          (2) Radiological Contamination. Radiological-contaminated surfaces should
not be burned. Burning will not destroy radiological contamination or its hazards. It may

spread contamination if radioactive particles become suspended in smoke spread by the
wind.
    e.    Exploding. Explosives can be used to blow up areas that have CB contamination;
however, they are of no value against radiological contamination.
          (1) CB Contamination. Detonating cord, bangalore torpedoes, or mine-clearing
charges may be used with the STB dry mix to clear small paths through a contaminated
area. The two methods are used as follows:
                (a) First Method. Remove the holding band, and loosen the lid of the
bleach drum. Set the drum with the lid in place upside down over about 3 feet of looped
detonation cord. Remove the drum, and leave the bleach piled on the lid as shown in
Figure I-1, A. Lids may be fired in a series with a single strand of detonation cord
connecting the loops.
                 (b) Second Method. Remove the holding band, and loosen the lid of the
bleach drum. Set the drum in a shallow hole as shown in Figure I-1, B. Make sure the lid
is loose. Use 5 feet of looped detonating cord (7 feet in soft ground) for each drum. The
drums may be fired individually or in a series. For gross contamination, additional firings
may be necessary.
                 (c) For either emplacement method, the suggested spacing for charges is
33 feet apart for a 100-foot front contaminated area. The charges should be placed along
the upwind edge of the contaminated area (see Figure I-1, C). Drums may be fired
individually or in a series.

         (2) Radiological Contamination. Explosives will not destroy radiological
contamination or its hazards.

     f.   Flushing. Flushing with large quantities of water removes contamination. A
pressurized stream of hot, soapy water delivered by the M12A1 PDDA, M17 LDS, or fire
trucks can remove significant amounts of an agent. Scrubbing removes even more agent.
           (1) CB Contamination. Flushing is not very effective against some kinds of
agents, especially thickened agents. However, flushing may speed up the weathering
process.
           (2) Radiological Contamination. Flushing is very effective for removing loose
radioactive contamination such as fallout. Rainout, however, can coat surfaces with a film
that resists flushing. Such films must not be scrubbed. Any contamination removed by
flushing and scrubbing will remain radioactive, so control the runoff.
NOTE: Use the lid of an STB drum as a plunger to push STB into the air. Use a
1-meter length of detonation cord and form a loop smaller than the drum lid.
Place the loop on the ground. Loosen the lid of an STB drum. Hold the lid in
place while turning the drum upside down, and set it over the loop. Remove the
drum (the decontaminant will be piled on top of the lid). Use the decontaminant
drum as a makeshift mortar. The top end of the drum must be pointed in the
direction you wish to propel the decontaminant. Position the drum by digging a
shallow hole to hold and point the drum. Place a 1½-meter loop of detonation
cord in the bottom of the hole (2 meters in soft soil). Loosen the holding band on
the drum, loosen the lid, and set the drum upside down in the shallow hole.
     g.    Clearing. To clear passageways, remove the contaminated layers covering the
terrain.
           (1) CB Contamination. Most liquid chemical agents will not penetrate the soil
more than 2 inches, and biological agents penetrate even less. Earthmoving equipment or
hand tools can be used to scrap aside contamination. By scraping off 2 to 4 inches of earth,
a passageway can be created that is free of transfer hazards. However, contamination on
either side of the passageway will continue to present a vapor hazard.
            (2) Radiological Contamination. Fallout does not penetrate the top layer of soil
unless it is followed by rain. It can be scraped aside. Move contaminated soil as far away
as possible; the piles tend to concentrate radiation. Immediately below a nuclear blast
area, the soil may be radioactive to a depth of 5 feet. In most cases, the decontamination of
this much earth is not practical.
3.    Types of Surfaces
   The type of surface will influence the type of decontamination method selected.
Sample decontamination methods are described for the following representative surfaces:
      a.   Beaches.
           (1) Removing. Use earthmoving equipment or hand tools to scrape off a 5- to
10-centimeter (2- to 4-inch) layer of earth. Most liquid chemical agents will not penetrate
more than 5 centimeters (2 inches) beneath the surface. Immediately below a nuclear blast
area, the soil may be radioactive to a depth of 1½ meters. In such cases, decontamination is
not practical.
           (2) Covering. Use roofing paper, wood mats, or other covering material to
furnish a protective mat for the passage of personnel.

          (3) Flushing. A pump and hose may be used. The agent exposed to the surf is
decontaminated by wave action. The extent of decontamination depends on the number of
washings by the tide, the type of beach, the type of contamination, and the weather.
           (3)   Neutralizing. Spread STB over the surface, using caution on liquid agents.
     b.    Hard Surfaces.
           (1) Flushing. If the surface is well-drained and sufficient water is available,
flush the surface thoroughly with water.
           (2)   Neutralizing. Spray the surface with slurry from a PDDA.
     c.    Dirt Roads.
           (1)   Removing. Scrape the contamination to the side with road graders.
           (2) Covering. Cover paths across the road with at least 10 centimeters (4
inches) of earth.
           (3)   Neutralizing. Spray the surface with STB slurry.
     d.    Grass and Low Vegetation.
          (1) Burning. Burning is the quickest and most efficient method of
decontaminating CB agents when the area is covered with grass or short undergrowth. Dry
grass and dry wood burn readily; gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, or fire bombs may be used to
burn green or wet vegetation. Normally, burning a contaminated area does not completely
destroy the agent and protective equipment (protective clothing and mask) must still be
worn. Spreading dry mix after the vegetation has been removed by burning will reduce the
hazard further. If the contamination is radiological, do not burn it. Burning will spread
contamination if radioactive particles become suspended in the smoke.
          (2) Exploding. Clear paths through low vegetation with detonating cord,
bangalore torpedoes, or mine-clearing line charges.

                                         Appendix K 

        CONTAMINATED-WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL 


1.   Background
       This appendix provides planners, commanders, and unit personnel with operational
guidance and procedures on the collection and disposal of contaminated waste. The use of
contamination avoidance material may increase the amount of contaminated waste that
must be properly collected and disposed of after an attack. Contaminated items may
include IPE, field gear, M8/M9 paper, components of M291 and M295 kits, pallet covers,
bulk plastic, tarps, and other contamination avoidance covers and decontamination
solutions. Waste must be collected and disposed of properly to limit hazards. Depending on
the type and quantity of contaminated material, waste accumulation areas could increase
local hazards and require increased protective measures. Advance planning is the key to
the successful handling and disposal of contaminated waste.
2.   Responsibility
     It is the responsibility of all personnel to ensure safe operations.
    a.    Unit commanders ensure that waste collection sites are established, properly
marked, reported, and maintained.
      b.    All personnel apply contamination avoidance techniques and procedures,
establish and maintain waste collection points, and segregate wastes for localized
collection. Deployed personnel are responsible for limiting, to the greatest extent possible,
cross contamination, postconflict cleanup, and restoration actions.
     c.    The CBRN control center (CC) provides technical guidance and oversight for
establishing unit contaminated waste disposal areas and marks and plots accumulation
points and disposal areas on local area and grid maps.
     d.   Medical authorities provide technical oversight and guidance for personal safety
and health-related issues.
3.   Contaminated-Waste Holding Areas
    It is probable that multiple sites may be required with one large centralized
accumulation point.
4.   Unit Waste Accumulation Points
     Units must effectively plan for the disposition of waste during decontamination
operations.
     a.   Planners should consider site selection based on a number of factors, such as
terrain and prevailing seasonal winds. The area must be located downwind of work areas
and rest and relief locations.
     b.   Accumulation points should be downwind from the rear or entrance to areas such
as bunkers, fighting positions, or CCAs.




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60              K-1
      c.    All unit accumulation points should be identified and reported to the CBRN CC.
The CBRN CC has the responsibility to mark and plot each accumulation point on local,
grid, or area maps.
      d.   When feasible, waste accumulation points should be located on concrete, asphalt,
or other paved surfaces. Avoid positioning the accumulation point on grass or vegetated
areas. Position waste accumulation points so that personnel can transverse a straight line
from their shelter, bunker, or facility to the area without having to cross wet, muddy, or
vegetated areas.
      e.   Waste should be separated by type (solid versus liquid and combustible versus
noncombustible). No sharp objects that could puncture the plastic liner are to be placed
directly into the waste container. Sharp objects should be packaged in a rigid waste
container. Collecting sharp objects or material in a cardboard box overwrapped with a 6-mil
plastic bag should prevent objects from penetrating or perforating the protective cover.
     f.   Proper marking prevents unintentional contact and alerts personnel of the
hazard.
    g.    Containers holding contaminated waste must be in good condition and
compatible with the waste being stored.
          (1) The container must always be closed during storage, except when it is
necessary to add or remove waste.
           (2) Large trash receptacles, 55-gallon barrels, or similar containers are ideal
vessels for collecting contaminated solid waste. These should be lined with a double layer
of 6-mil plastic bags.
           (3) Liquid waste can be stored in 5-gallon or larger containers. A small
containment berm should be placed around any liquid-holding area to control potential
runoff or spills. The use of sandbags or other suitable material should be used to construct
a small containment berm.
    h.    If sufficient equipment exists, place automatic vapor alarms around or just
upwind of the area.
           (1) CBRN reconnaissance personnel should also periodically monitor just
outside the area with handheld vapor detection devices such as the CAM or the M256.
          (2) To indicate contamination from an attack or cross contamination, M8 or M9
paper should be positioned around the accumulation point.
5.    Equipment and Material
     The following items or a suitable substitute should be available for establishing and
maintaining the waste accumulation point. Quantities of this material will vary based on
the number of individuals and area supported.
     a.    Containers for solid-waste and liquid-waste streams (e.g., waste receptacle
[44-gallon] National Stock Number [NSN]: 7240-00-151-6630; 5-gallon Jerri can, water,
NSN: 7240-00-089-3827).
      b.   Marking material: NBC marking kit (sign kit, contamination, M274, NSN: 9905
01-346-4716; chemiluminescent lights, white, 8-hour, NSN: 6260-01-247-0367; surveyor’s
tape, red, NSN: 9905-01-458-1192; paper and grease pencils or permanent markers).

     c.    Plastic sheeting, 0.006 thick, clear, NSN: 8135-00-579-6489.
     d.    Plastic bags, 60 by 30 inches, 0.006 thick, NSN: 8150-01-221-3239.
     e.    Pressure-sensitive tape (multiple NSNs available).
      f.  Personal decontamination materials: M291 kit, NSN: 6850-01-276-1905; M295
kit, NSN: 6850-01-357-8456; 5 percent bleach; water; and bucket or catch basin.
     g.    CBRN detection equipment.
     h.    Funnel for pouring liquid waste into collection containers.
     i.    Sandbags, NSN: 8105-00-285-4744.
6.   Procedures for the Collection of Contaminated Waste
      The potential for personnel to be cross-contaminated is at its highest during the
collection of contaminated material for disposal. The following activities are examples to
minimize the time and effort to perform them:
      a.   The collection of contaminated waste should be accomplished in the least amount
of time by at least two trained personnel.
     b.  Supervisors assign personnel trained to perform the duties to detect
contamination and remove contaminated coverings in and around their area.
        (1) A systematic search of the area for contamination should be planned and
communicated to unit personnel.
          (2) The priority for removing protective covers from unit assets must be
established. Priority should be given to immediate-use items and high-value and/or
limited-quantity items that directly effect mission accomplishment.
     c.   Prior to starting the operation, personnel must check to ensure that IPE is
properly worn, using the buddy system.
     d.    Unit personnel must check for contamination in assigned areas.
         (1) Starting with the priority items, remove and replace contaminated M8 and
M9 paper and contamination avoidance material.
           (2) Contaminated material collected should be placed in a 6-mil plastic bag
(preferably clear plastic). When collection bags are approximately three-quarters full,
personnel must seal the top of the bag closed.
          (3) Place the first bag into a clean 6-mil bag. To reduce the potential of
contaminating the outside of the clean bag, the assistance of a second person may be
required.
           (4) Perform immediate glove decontamination, utilizing M291 or M295 kits or
5 percent bleach solution (see Figure K-1, page K-4).

                             Figure K-1. Glove Decontamination
           (5)   Repeat the bag-sealing process for the outer (clean) bag.
           (6) Perform immediate glove decontamination utilizing M291/M295 kits or 5
percent bleach solution.
           (7)   Prepare the material for transport to the waste accumulation point.
          (8) Place contaminated markings on the outer bag. The bags must be clearly
marked with the contents, type of contaminant or agent, date, time, and location (see
Figure K-2).




                                    Figure K-2. Markings
NOTE: Supervisors will contact the controlling unit for waste pickup. Waste that
is not properly labeled and packaged will not be picked up until the problem is
corrected.
     e.    Material (such as pallet covers and bulk plastic) that will not fit into standard
6-mil trash bags require a different procedure or process as follows:
         (1) Starting from the long end of the material, with arms extended, grasp the
bottom and roll the material onto itself. Properly done, this will contain any contamination



K-4                   FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60          4 April 2006
inside the cover or plastic, away from the individual, while reducing air pockets and the
bulkiness of the material.
           (2) After the material is rolled, fold the two outer ends toward the center and
secure the material with tape or string so that it will not unfold or unroll.
           (3)   Secure and seal the material in an outer wrapping.
           •    If ground contamination is/was suspected, place a drop cloth on the ground
to reduce the potential for cross contamination of the outer wrapper.
           •     Avoid kneeling on the ground.
           •    Place the material on a section of clean 6-mil plastic sheet, large enough to
fully wrap the material.
           •    Perform immediate glove decontamination utilizing M291 or M295 kits or 5
percent bleach solution.
          •     Fold the ends of the outer wrapper toward the center, overlap the material,
and secure the seams with pressure-sensitive tape.
           (4) Perform immediate glove decontamination utilizing M291 or M295 kits or 5
percent bleach solution.
           (5)   Prepare the material for transport to the unit waste accumulation point.
          (6) Place contaminated markings on the outer wrapping. The outer wrapping
must be clearly marked with the contents, type of contaminant or agent, date, and time.
NOTE: Leaders will contact the unit operation center for waste pickup and
transportation to the contaminated-waste site.
7.   Transportation Procedures
     The transportation of contaminated waste should be coordinated and controlled
through the CBRN CC. This is accomplished to effectively control and account for the
contaminated waste, reduce the contamination of multiple vehicles, and eliminate
unnecessary risk to personnel.
     a.  Transporters will wear appropriate protective clothing and have personal
decontamination kits immediately available.
    b.   Prior to starting the transportation and collection process from unit
accumulation sites to a centralized disposal site, the vehicle driver will—
     •     Ensure that the vehicle is properly marked as contaminated.
     •     Position contamination marking signs on the vehicle.
     •     Allow no one to ride in the open back of a vehicle or trailer.
          (1) A layer of 6-mil plastic may be positioned in the bed of the vehicle to
minimize the spread of contamination.
         (2) As waste material is collected, checks are conducted to verify that
contaminated bags or containers are properly marked.

8.    Waste Collection Point
     Establishing waste collection points must be a well-thought-out process to ensure the
safety of all personnel in the area.
      a.   Planners must coordinate with joint and HN forces for proper siting of the CBRN
waste accumulation site. To avoid multiple large accumulation points, consideration must
be given for the consolidation of contaminated waste from nearby friendly forces or sister
services. Site selection should be based on prevailing seasonal winds and be away from any
living, working, and rest or relief areas, terrain, and security. The location and size will
vary based on the amount of waste generated. Preferred locations are downwind of the
friendly forces, on flat, unvegetated terrain, in a secure but remote area, and away from
areas that are populated by friendly forces or civilians.
     b.   Any contaminated waste must be disposed of in accordance with applicable local
guidance.
     c. Waste should be separated by type (solid versus liquid and combustible versus
noncombustible).
     d.    The disposal site and waste are clearly identified. Contaminated marking signs
are also prepared in advance to mark containers after use. Proper marking prevents
unintentional contact and alerts personnel of the hazard. The collection containers must be
marked with their contents, along with the type of contamination or agent, date, and time.
Additionally, personnel should establish a cordon around the immediate area and put up
signs to control unauthorized access.
     e.    If sufficient equipment exists, automatic vapor alarms are placed around or just
upwind of the area. CBRN reconnaissance personnel should also periodically monitor just
outside the area with handheld vapor detection devices, such as the ICAM or the M256.
    f.   When contaminated material or waste material require disposal, different
methods can be used to dispose of the material.
          (1) For example, burning produces a vapor hazard and the CBRN CC must
submit an NBC5 report if material is burned in order to warn downwind units.
          (2) Burial is another method that is effective for all types of contamination.
The area must also be marked to help ensure that the area is avoided. The unit that closes
the decontamination site must also notify the CBRN CC. The CBRN CC must submit an
NBC5 report outlining the contaminated-waste burial site.
9.    Disposal Procedures
     The proper disposal of contaminated waste is paramount to safely conducting
decontamination operations.
     a.    The three primary ways of handling the problem of waste disposal are open
storage, burying, and burning.
     b.    All personnel directly or indirectly engaged in disposal operations must be
properly trained in the operational procedures, hazards, and safety precautions.
      c.   Disposal procedures must be coordinated with the CBRN CC.




K-6                  FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60         4 April 2006
10. Open Storage
     The HN or command guidance may prohibit the burning or burial of waste. Garbage,
rubbish, and other such material may have to be stored pending transportation to a waste
disposal facility. Wastewater poses significant challenges.
     a.   The laundering of potentially contaminated items (i.e., suits) will generate a
considerable amount of wastewater that must be controlled and analyzed for
contamination.
     b.   The use of water or 5 percent hypochlorite solution for decontamination will
generate a considerable amount of liquid that requires disposal. To reduce volume,
planners should consider the use of evaporation tanks/lagoons.
     c.   Planners should consider the use of large containers, such as sea and land
shipping containers, during open storage for storing or consolidating the waste.
           (1) For open storage of contaminated waste, the use of large containers offers
advantages, such as ample storage space, protection from the environment, limited access
to the contaminated material, the ease of loading, availability at most deployed locations,
and low cost.
         (2) The primary disadvantage and hazard is that the size of the containers
makes them difficult to move, and sealed containers will contain off-gassing vapors.
11. Burying
     Burying contaminated items should be well-thought-out, planned and recorded.
      a.    When closed, the burial pit should have a mound of dirt placed over the top.
Marking signs must be placed to indicate the type of pit, pits contents, date closed, and unit
designation. Maintaining accurate records on the type and quantity of material buried is
critical for postconflict cleanup actions
     b.    Other guidance includes—
     •     Marking contaminated material that is placed in the burial pit.
     •     Recording all items placed in the burial pit.
     •     Using containers for placement in the burial pit.
12. Open Burning
     Open burning is the burning of any material wherein air contaminants resulting from
combustion are emitted directly into the air, without passing through a stack or chimney
from an enclosed chamber.
      a.   Site selection. Planners must consider prevailing winds along with the potential
for release of toxic vapors and hazardous ash during the selection of the site.
          (1) Contaminated waste should be disposed of in an open space where there
are no woods or heavy brush that might trap fumes close to the operation, especially in the
downwind direction.
           (2) The area should be cleared of all combustible material, out to a 250-foot
radius if possible. No burning shall occur within 250 feet of a power line or within 500 feet




4 April 2006             FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                K-7
of a frequently traveled road, fuel storage area, or pipeline. The disposal site should be
constructed on a flat, compacted surface that is free of vegetation and combustible material.
     b.  The emission of toxic fumes released during burning may result in the release of
heavy metals and toxic chemicals such as dioxin.
     c.   Disposal shall not be undertaken without prior approval of the CBRN CC. Local
procedures will dictate how far in advance disposal operations must be coordinated, but for
most operations, a minimum 24-hour notice is required. This will allow the CBRN CC to
up-channel required reports to notify friendly forces of a potential toxic cloud in the
downwind area.
       d.    Prior to conducting burning operations, the following agencies should be notified:
       •     CBRN CC.
       •     Medical facility.
       •     Security forces.
       •     Higher HQ.
       •     Bioenvironmental engineering (BEE).
       •     Sister services and HN personnel, as appropriate.
    e.    Weather precautions. No burning shall be conducted during unfavorable
meteorological conditions (see Table K-1) such as:
       •     During an electrical storm or when such a storm is approaching.
       •     During high winds (wind velocity exceeding 20 mph).
       •     During an unsatisfactory temperature gradient.

       f.    Burning should be conducted during daylight hours only.
     g.  Fire prevention is an integral part of any disposal operation. Firefighting
equipment must be available on site or immediately available for response.
       •     No open flames are allowed in or near the disposal site.
     •     Fires must be attended at all times. Attendants must remain upwind and
outside the area until all smoke and fumes dissipate.




K-8                     FM 3-11.5/MCWP 3-37.3/NTTP 3-11.26/AFTTP(I) 3-2.60                4 April 2006
     h.  Records will be kept of all burning operations. These records shall include, at a
minimum, the type and quantity of all material destroyed and the disposition of any
residue.
    i.     The burn pit should be a minimum of 1.22 meters (4 feet) deep with sides sloping
enough to prevent cave in. The length and width of the trench will be determined by the
quantity of material anticipated for disposal.
          (1) Place combustible material, such as scrap wooden pallets or dunnage, in
the bottom of the pit at least 0.31 meter (1 foot deep).
           (2) Place contaminated waste on the combustible material, ensuring that the
combustible material extends beyond the layer of waste. Continue adding waste to the pit
until the top of the waste is within 0.31 meter (1 foot) from the top of the pit or trench. To
ensure a through burn, do not compact layers of waste material into the pit.
           (3)   Ensure that the area is clear of all unnecessary personnel and vehicles.
          (4) Pour a refined petroleum product (diesel fuel or kerosene) over the entire
pile. Contaminated fuel can be used. Do not use gasoline or any volatile, flammable liquid.
           (5) Remotely ignite the pit or trench. The fire department or EOD can provide
detailed training or assistance on how to accomplish this.
           (6)   Do not reuse the pit for 24 hours after all burning has ceased.
     j.    The burn furnace method includes the following:
           (1)   Fire box burners provide more control, and they are safer to operate.
           (2) An air curtain incinerator is a portable or stationary combustion device
that directs a plane of high-velocity, forced-draft air through a manifold head into a pit with
vertical walls in such a manner as to maintain a curtain of air over the surface of the pit
and a recirculating motion of air under the curtain.
          (3) Personnel must follow the manufacturers’ recommended procedures for the
operation of the incinerator and blower unit.
                (a)   Material should be added to the incinerator remotely (i.e., with a
front-end loader).
              (b) Operators must remain upwind and away from any smoke and fumes
when adding material to the incinerator.
13. Marking Requirements
     The marking of unit waste accumulation points is essential for ensuring the safe
return to operations and for future remediation efforts of potentially contaminated areas.
      a.    A critical component of the unit waste accumulation point is the proper marking
and isolation of the contaminated waste. The waste accumulation point is clearly
identified, and all containers containing contaminated waste are labeled. Proper marking
prevents unintentional contact and alerts personnel of the hazard. The collection
containers must be marked with the type of contamination or agent, date, time, and
location of origin. Additionally, the immediate area should be cordoned off and signs posted
to control unauthorized access.

     b.   Signs and markers should be placed so that they are visible from all potential
approach directions. Include dual language, if required, to warn HN personnel of the
hazard. Area signs and markers should be placed around—
       •   All disposal areas.
       •   Boundary of zones and TFAs.
       •   Entry control points and holding areas.
       •   Contaminated waste.
       •   Aeration areas.
       •   Monitoring stations and equipment.
       •   Transportation routes.
