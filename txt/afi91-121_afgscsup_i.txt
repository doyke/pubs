             NUCLEAR SURETY STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT PROGRAM

1.1. Scope of the Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visit (NSSAV) Program. The Secretary of
the Air Force established the NSSAV program to assist nuclear tasked units, on a non-attribution
basis, in maintaining effective nuclear surety programs. The NSSAV is an opportunity to receive
assistance from experienced headquarters personnel who write nuclear surety policy and
guidance. It is not an inspection nor is it intended to prepare units to pass Nuclear Surety
Inspections (NSI). NSSAV will not give a rating, score, grade, or assessment statements about
units, however if the NSSAV team identifies significant observations, they can recommend that
the wing conduct root cause analysis of each significant observation and provide results to the
NSSAV lead division or team chief. NSSAV team chief will determine which MAJCOM
identified write-ups require a formal root cause analysis. Assessment statements will be limited
to processes and procedures. Attachment 2 outlines typical areas observed during an NSSAV.
Wing commanders may use the NSSAV results to strengthen the unit Nuclear Surety Program.
MAJCOMs will designate a division (lead division) as Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
for the NSSAV program to include root cause analysis follow up. This division will coordinate
with other HQ divisions on nuclear surety staff assistance visit policy issues and guidance.
Applicable HQ staff agencies act as offices of collateral responsibility (OCR). The NSSAV also
provides an opportunity for resolution and clarification of issues between the unit and
headquarters functional managers. The objective is threefold:
1.1. (AFGSC)Scope of the Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visit (NSSAV)
Program. AFGSC Weapons Safety (AFGSC/SEW) manages the NSSAV program and
coordinates with AFGSC Staff on NSSAV policy issues and guidance. For AFRC nuclear surety
associated units, AFGSC/SEW will coordinate with AFRC/SEW/A3N to provide over-the-
shoulder assistance on AFRC specific compliance areas (safety, loading, PRP, aircrew,
command post, etc.). (T-2).
   1.1.1. Determine if higher headquarters guidance is adequate and clear.
   1.1.2. Provide feedback to the wing commander on whether the unit is properly applying
   sound procedures to implement Nuclear Surety guidance.
   1.1.3. Provide situational awareness on command nuclear surety to senior leadership in the
   form of an NSSAV executive summary and annual crossfeed report.
1.2. Assistance Areas. NSSAV team assesses all areas included in CJCSI 3263.05, Nuclear
Weapons Technical Inspection, and AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities as supplemented.
Additional areas may be assessed by MAJCOM staffs as time permits or when requested by
MAJCOM/CC or wing leadership. At Joint Bases where USAF is a supported component,
installation support is a sister service responsibility and USAF may not control elements of the
Nuclear Surety program at that installation. NSSAV team will either include sister service
members to evaluate supporting processes and procedures, or forward team observations to the
Joint Base chain of command.
1.3. Method of Assessment.

    1.3.1. For Technical Operations, NSSAV team members will select maintenance teams for
    each specific technical operation based on team/crew integrity.
    1.3.1. (AFGSC) Prior to assessing Technical Operations, the NSSAV team will provide the
    individuals being assessed a Technical Operation briefing utilizing Attachment 4. (T-2).
       1.3.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Technical Operations are based on the unit’s current
       Maintenance Capability Letter (MCL) and will include associated support programs.
       ICBM Technical Operations will be based on applicability to nuclear surety (e.g.
       component certifications, tape load, CCV, RS handling, certified nuclear loading tasks,
       etc.). (T-2).
       1.3.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Unit Quality Assurance (QA) may be observed conducting
       evaluations. (T-2).
    1.3.2. Team integrity for the weapons load crews will be maintained IAW AFI 21-101,
    Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-202, Missile Maintenance
    Management, requirements. To demonstrate their knowledge and proficiency, they will
    normally be tasked to perform at least one evaluation of a maintenance operation within their
    area of responsibility. Loading Standardization Crews and Squadron Lead Crews will be
    observed by the NSSAV team.
    1.3.3. For Weapon Security, NSSAV functional area experts will use performance based
    methodology to determine whether a unit meets the Nuclear Weapons Security Standard
    (NWSS). They will observe the integrated execution of security actions and response
    (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable. They will observe
    execution of applicable plans and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). They will
    assess the effectiveness of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems, and other
    technology. They will assess the use of available options to deny unauthorized access to
    nuclear weapons. If denial is not achieved, the ability to prevent the loss, theft, damage or
    destruction of nuclear weapons will be assessed. NSSAV functional area members will
    develop or validate wing planned exercises are realistic scenarios to determine the wing’s
    ability to meet the NWSS. NSSAV team will assess the adequacy of and compliance with
    approved compensatory measures for MAJCOM approved security deviations.
    1.3.4. Random nuclear surety testing will be administered, as per AFI 91-101, to a minimum
    of 25 percent of available personnel certified under the Personnel Reliability Program in the
    wing/unit (i.e. not on TDY/leave).
    1.3.4. (AFGSC) Minimum passing score on the written test is 80 percent. The tests will be
    built and administered by AFGSC/SEW from the current Nuclear Surety Lesson Plan Master
    Question Test Bank. (T-2).
    1.3.5. A minimum of 5 percent of personnel and medical PRP records will be reviewed for
    compliance with governing DoD and AF guidance. NSSAV team will review the
    administrative qualifications, certification, continuing evaluation, removal from PRP duties,
    return to duty, and training and management processes, using record reviews to substantiate
    above processes employed by the unit. PRP processes, not records reviews will be the
    primary focus.

  be administered at bases with a strategic (USAFE: Non-Strategic Nuclear Forces Command
  Post) tasking to 80 percent of available certified controllers and COMSEC TPC Team
  Member (i.e. not on TDY/leave or just ending a 12-hour CP shift).
  1.3.6. (AFGSC) Minimum passing score on the written test is 90 percent. (T-2).
  1.3.7. MAJCOMs will determine additional items to be observed during the NSSAV based
  upon wing commander input, NAF input and on unique mission requirements.
  1.3.8. For Active and Classical Associate/Total Force Integration (TFI) units, the active duty
  unit will have responsibility for the associate/TFI unit outlined in this instruction. For
  Reserve Association/TFI units, the active duty unit will have responsibility for the Reserve
  Associate/TFI unit outlined in this instruction.
  1.3.9. (Added-AFGSC) A minimum of one single channel anti-jam man portable (SCAMP)
  set-up crew will be observed during the NSSAV. (T-2).

   MAJCOM agencies. These visits should occur 12 to 14 months after each unit’s last NSI.
   This interval provides a mid-course assessment point between no-notice NSIs while
   minimizing the probability of an NSI occurring prior to a scheduled NSSAV. For example,
   if an NSI occurs in Jul 12, the next NSSAV should be scheduled between Jul-Nov 13. SAV
   scheduling should follow Gatekeeper rules IAW 90-201. The only exception to this
   scheduling guidance is when a wing commander requests an NSSAV. Exception: USAFE
   may deviate from this schedule as required to accommodate host nation requirements and the
   Functional Expert Visit Program.

   1.4.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC/SEW, in coordination with the unit and AFGSC Gatekeeper, will
   schedule NSSAVs four to six months prior to next NSI. (T-2).
   1.4.2. MAJCOMs will provide a notification message to the NAF/Center and unit 60 days
   prior to the planned visit confirming NSSAV date, lead division point of contact (POC),
   billeting, transportation and team work center requirements (provide an info copy to the
   installation-owning MAJCOM if NSSAV is for a tenant unit). Units will appoint an NSSAV
   POC and forward the name to the MAJCOM within one week of receiving the notification
   message.
   1.4.3. Units will locally coordinate and provide inputs on a proposed NSSAV Sequence of
   Events (SOE). Units will send a draft SOE to the MAJCOM NLT 40 days prior to the
   scheduled visit. MAJCOMs will ensure the proposed SOE fulfills NSSAV requirements and
   coordinate the proposed SOE within the staff. NSSAV team members will coordinate
   functional area specific scheduling requirements with their unit POCs. A confirmed SOE will
   be completed by the unit and submitted to the MAJCOM NLT 14 days prior to NSSAV team
   arrival. After the visit and events SOE is confirmed, any scheduling conflicts must be
   immediately brought to the attention of the MAJCOM NSSAV POC for resolution.
   1.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) If a wing commander requests it and timing and funding allows,
   AFGSC/SE will support a tailored NSSAV team to assess corrective actions. (T-2).
1.5. NSSAV Funding. MAJCOMs will advocate for an adequate annual budget and manpower
to fund all TDY costs associated with providing NSSAV visits to all nuclear wings within 12-14
months after a full NSI. The NSSAV budget should be managed by the lead division.
MAJCOMs will determine guidance for compensation of civilian NSSAV team members
working overtime during the visit.

   will not be responsible for any overtime associated with a NSSAV. (T-2).
   1.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/SE will budget travel based on the following: (T-2).
       1.5.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) To maintain fiscal responsibility and team integrity,
       AFGSC/SE will use MILAIR for NSSAV travel, if available. NSSAV team members are
       required to depart and return via the pre designated travel plans. Any deviations from
       approved travel require authorization and excess costs will be assessed to the sending unit
       IAW the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR). The waiver authority resides with the
       Team Chief. (T-2).
   1.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) Each team member will be provided a cross-organizational fund
   cite from AFGSC/SEW defining the maximum allowance for travel/per diem. (T-2).
1.6. NSSAV Team Composition and Requirements.

      other units and/or organizations may augment the team. MAJCOMS will determine the
      priority for units from which to draw augmentees. Actual NSSAV team size, composition,
      and requirements will vary according to base and assigned nuclear mission. The team should
      consist of a cross-functional areas and commands that contribute to nuclear surety at the wing
      receiving the NSSAV. MAJCOMs will determine team composition for each base that
      receives an NSSAV. Team Composition will include members of the ANG when NSSAV
      involves ANG personnel and assets.
      1.6.1. (AFGSC) Refer to Table 1.1 for base-specific team requirements. Functional
      directorates will fund additional team members. The priority for augmentee selection is:

             NUCLEAR SURETY STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT SUMMARY

2.1. NSSAV Report.
   2.1.1. NSSAV reports assist the units in identifying strengths and areas for improvement in
   order to enhance overall nuclear surety effectiveness. Identified deficiencies will reference
   governing instructions and guidance (i.e. AFI, MAJCOM Instructions, T.O., USSTRATCOM
   Publications, etc.) NSSAV reports will be classified IAW CJCSI 3263.05 Enclosure F, para
   2.
   2.1.2. The NSSAV team project officer uses inputs provided by each functional team
   member to build the report in accordance with the contents listed at Attachment 2. The
   NSSAV team chief will provide a draft copy of the NSSAV report to the wing commander
   prior to the team’s departure and provide a copy to the lead division upon return to the staff
   location. The authority for further distribution resides with the wing and/or MAJCOM/CC.
   The Air Force Safety Center, AF/A10, MAJCOM Directorates and Special Staff,
   Associate/TFI MAJCOM, NAF/Center CCs will receive a semi-annual crossfeed report NLT
   1 April and 1 October each calendar year. The report will include a sanitized listing of
   significant observations, observations, recommended improvement areas, and
   strengths/techniques identified in the NSSAV reports. The lead division retains an office
   record copy on file, and has the option to distribute detailed reports outside of the division
   with the approval of the MAJCOM/CC. To preserve NSSAV program integrity, the report
   will not be distributed to the Inspector General (IG) but, report contents may be shared with
   the IG if approved by the unit commander. Additionally, to preserve program integrity,
   NSSAV team members will not be used as IG augmentees at a wing/unit where they have
   performed an NSSAV in the past 12 months. (T-1).
   2.1.3. Team members include all safety, security and weapon system reliability related
   observations in the detailed report. Observations will be referenced by published guidance,
   with paragraph number to maximum extent possible. Overall and sub-area ratings are not
   assigned. Observations are classified in the following categories:
      2.1.3.1. STRENGTH - An observation that highlights strong processes, knowledge, or
      performance.
      2.1.3.2. SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATION - Any deficiency having or likely to have a
      major negative effect on the nuclear weapons mission of the activity.
      2.1.3.3. OBSERVATION - Any deficiency not meeting, having or likely to have a major
      negative effect on the nuclear weapons mission of the activity, but requires corrective
      action.
      2.1.3.4. RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENT AREA - These leave behinds are
      suggestions to improve a process (Does not require referencing governing instruction or
      guidance).
      2.1.3.5. (Added-AFGSC) MAJCOM TAKEAWAY – These observations require
      further action by the AFGSC staff. They will be tracked to completion through the
AFI91-121_AFGSCSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            15


       AFGSC Nuclear Surety Working Group and must identify which staff agency is the
       office of primary responsibility (OPR). (T-2).

                           TECHNICAL OPERATION BRIEFING

1.      My name is___________. I am representing AFGSC. I am primarily interested in
Safety, Security, and Reliability and discrepancies noted during the task will be documented.
After the task is complete, QA will brief me on their observations of the task, prior to out
briefing the maintenance team. If Safety, Security or Reliability requirements are violated, I
will stop the operation.
2.     Perform the operation as you do day-to-day. Include all required In-Process (IP), Visuals
or Supervisory inspections. Make certain each of these requirements is clear to me as they are
being performed.
3.     If I ask questions, give me the answer as you understand the question. If you do not
know the answer, please consult with someone in your supervisory chain, but answer the
question. (All answers are due after technical operations are complete).
4.      You are not expected to exceed your normal area of responsibility. If an abnormal
situation presents itself and is not covered in technical data, consult with higher authorities. I
require a full assessment of the nature of the problem and your corrective actions. All source
inputs may be assessed.
5.     I will assess all documentation and entries generated as the result of this technical
operation.
6.      Please coordinate all deviations prior to the start of the operation; remember to brief me
as the deviations occur. All training weapons will be treated as WR during the operation.
7.      I am not on PRP at this unit; therefore, I cannot be part of a TWO-PERSON team. If I
am in the immediate area of a critical component it is your responsibility to fulfill the TWO-
PERSON CONCEPT requirements. I will not test your TWO-PERSON procedures by
intentionally misleading you. If I am someplace that I should not be, please ask me to move.
8.     * (Read only if observers are present). During this operation, observers will be
present. They are not part of a TWO-PERSON team and should not interact with any member of
your team throughout this operation.
9.     Are there any questions?
