                                                                                      Distribution: F

This base instruction outlines procedures to be implemented when severe winter weather threatens the
Grand Forks AFB area. This instruction addresses actions to support decision-making at the wing level;
groups and squadrons will develop their own specific operating procedures to augment and meet their
unique severe winter weather operating requirements.


1. Concept of Operations: Because of the unpredictability of weather, a flexible plan is key to promot-
ing personnel safety and ensuring mission accomplishment. This plan will employ a geographic tier sys-
tem that allows the wing commander to release personnel who live furthest from the base while retaining
essential personnel to keep operations running. Various base agencies, offices, and organizations have dif-
ferent mission degrees of being “storm essential.” There will be certain actions that some units will take
while others will not. The wing commander has the prerogative to implement, modify, or selectively
revoke portions of this plan based upon weather conditions, safety factors, and need for mission accom-
plishment.

2. Definitions: These definitions are applicable only in the context of this plan and are listed to provide
standardization among base units.
   2.1. Adverse or Severe Weather Conditions: Environmental conditions such as poor visibility,
   heavy snow, blizzards, wind chill, etc., that may have a negative impact on mission accomplishment
   and/or personnel and equipment safety.
   2.2. Extreme Cold Temperatures Essential Personnel: A list of personnel the unit commander
   deems absolutely essential to mission accomplishment when adverse or severe weather temperatures
   (IAW para 2.7., Chill Factor) threatens. This provides the commander data with which to plan severe
   weather operations, and lets unit personnel know in advance their duty status, eliminating confusion
   on who should report for work, or go home when weather threatens.

    2.3. Storm Essential Personnel. A list of personnel the unit commander deems absolutely essential
    to mission accomplishment when adverse or severe weather threatens. This provides the commander
    data with which to plan severe weather operations, and lets unit personnel know in advance their duty
    status, eliminating confusion on who should report for work or go home when weather threatens.
    2.4. Minimum Manning. Absolute minimum manning required to keep all functions operational.
    2.5. Telephone Standby. Readiness posture requiring personnel to remain in quarters during adverse/
    severe weather conditions so they may be recalled back to duty if necessary.
    2.6. Travel Conditions. Grand Forks AFB will use the following criteria in describing local travel
    conditions:


TRAVEL                    GREEN                        YELLOW                      RED

                                                                                   Stay off Roads
                                                       Speed limit 20mph

3. Responsibilities.
    3.1. The 319th Mission Support Group Commander (319 MSG/CC), with the concurrence of the
    319th Wing Commander (319 ARW/CC), is responsible for the implementation of this plan when
    adverse weather threatens Grand Forks AFB. The 319 MSG/CC will:
       3.1.1. Monitor weather conditions when severe winter weather is forecast. Sources of data include
       319 OSS/OSW, the Weather Channel, local television and radio stations, the Air Force Law
       Enforcement Terminal System (AFLETS), and the North Dakota Highway Patrol which can pro-
       vide information on local road and weather conditions.
       3.1.2. When necessary, coordinate with the Grand Forks Public School grounds & maintenance
       personnel and the Superintendent of Schools to determine if base schools will open, and if condi-
       tions around the base will allow buses to safely reach Central High School in the city of Grand
       Forks.
       3.1.3. Based on the available data, determine as early as possible if it is necessary to close the base
       before personnel attempt to report for duty. During the duty day, it will be determined if conditions
       have or will deteriorate to the extent that personnel need to be released to ensure their safe travel.
       If either of these conditions exist, the 319 MSG/CC will immediately coordinate with the other
       group commanders to determine the mission impact of the severe weather and potential base clo-
       sure or early release of personnel. The 319 MSG/CC will brief the 319 ARW/CC and recommend
       an appropriate course of action. Courses of action may include, but are not limited to the follow-
       ing:
GRANDFORKSAFBI10-103 11 AUGUST 2005                                                                    3


          3.1.3.1. Staggered duty hours to reduce on-base congestion (military only).
          3.1.3.2. Liberal work arrival/departures hours (late-reporting/early departures).
          3.1.3.3. Base closure, storm essential personnel only.
          3.1.3.4. Direct minimum manning for less critical units.
          3.1.3.5. Limiting government owned vehicle (GOV) operations.
          3.1.3.6. Early release of personnel residing off-base.
          3.1.3.7. Directing telephone stand-by for personnel who reside off-base.
          3.1.3.8. Directing minimum manning for all units.
          3.1.3.9. Directing partial release of personnel based on the weather tier system.
      3.1.4. Once the course of action has been determined, the 319 MSG/CC will disseminate the clo-
      sure status via Network Control Center, Command Post, and SFCC. The objective is to make a
      decision at least one hour prior to implementing a course of action so collateral agencies can take
      appropriate actions. Additionally, the 319th Mission Support Group staff will notify the following
      agencies during normal duty hours and the command post after duty hours:

       3.4.2. Remain in close contact with 319 OSS/OSW to monitor any weather changes that would
       affect Grand Forks AFB operations.
       3.4.3. When directed by the 319 MSG/CC, pass on the appropriate closure or release message via
       base cable, radio net, and telephone conference system. Notify Public Affairs to contact the local
       television and radio stations with the appropriate message. The pyramid notification system may
       also be initiated, at the discretion of the 319 MSG/CC.
    3.5. Public Affairs will: Contact local television and radio stations to request broadcast of the appro-
    priate closure or release message.
    3.6. 319th Services Squadron (319 SVS) will:
       3.6.1. Obtain from civilian personnel office (CPO) and school principals (Twining and Eielson) a
       listing of storm-essential civilian personnel to determine potential numbers of personnel who may
       require temporary billeting due to the weather situation.
       3.6.2. Allow storm-essential personnel to eat in the dining facility.
    3.7. All Installation Group and Squadron Commanders will:
       3.7.1. As needed, develop supporting severe weather plans to cover their unique operating
       requirements.
       3.7.2. Determine their storm-essential personnel and ensure they are aware and briefed of their
       responsibilities. Also, provide a listing of civilian storm-essential personnel to the base CPO on or
       about 1 September.
       3.7.3. Brief this plan, and their respective group or squadron plans to the entire unit each year in
       September or October. Ensure personnel know their storm status (i.e., essential versus non-essen-
       tial), and the geographic tier they fall under.
       3.7.4. Ensure all personnel have sufficient cold weather gear on-hand. Also, ensure all personnel
       attend the annual Winter Driving Safety briefing.

4. Geographic Tier System.
    4.1. When severe weather threatens, it is crucial that the base release personnel as soon as possible to
    allow for safe travel. To ensure safe travel for those who have the farthest to travel, Grand Forks AFB
    will employ a geographic tier system. The tier system breaks out Grand Forks AFB and the surround-
    ing area into a series of concentric rings. Each ring is approximately 10 miles wide, with Grand Forks
    AFB at the center.
    4.2. The tiers are defined as follows:
       4.2.1. Tier 1 consists of Grand Forks AFB proper to include Sunflake housing.
       4.2.2. Tier 2 includes all area within a 10-mile radius from Grand Forks AFB.
       4.2.3. Tier 3 includes all areas within a 10-20-mile radius from Grand Forks AFB.
       4.2.4. Tier 4 includes all areas which extend beyond a 20-mile radius from Grand Forks AFB.
