This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 23-1, Materiel Management
Policy and Procedures. It supports AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and the United
States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Supplement, inspection programs. This checklist
identifies items that evaluate the ability of a unit with a wartime or contingency mission to
perform assigned operational missions (e.g., designed operational capability (DOC) and/or
mission essential task list (METL) associated taskings and assigned operations plan (OPLAN)
taskings). It applies to all USAFE Logistics Readiness Squadrons (LRS) and geographically
separated units (GSU) as indicated in Paragraph 2. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard (ANG) units. This checklist supports guidance in AFI
23-201, Fuels Management, as well as the associated USAFE Fuels Policy. This checklist is
intended for inspection use. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication on
AF Form 847, Recommendations for Change of Publication, to USAFE Logistics Directorate,
Readiness Division (HQ USAFE/A4R), Unit 3050 Box 105, APO AE 09094. Ensure all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this supplement are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Extensive changes
in references from the previous edition required a complete revision of this publication.
 2                                                             USAFECL23-5 5 MARCH 2012


1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or
assessment. As a minimum, units should use Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) checklists
in conjunction with the unit self-assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that
preclude attainment of required capabilities. Higher headquarters (HHQ) may use this checklist
in whole or in part during visits or exercises.
     1.1. Common Core Readiness Criteria (CCRC). CCRC represent five basic, overarching
     readiness criteria that the Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG) will apply to each area of its
     ORIs. Each CCRC has one or more associated questions to facilitate its use by inspectors.
     Upper case and bold letters are used to identify CCRCs. The five areas include:
        1.1.1. Threat. Is the unit able to implement and sustain appropriate measures to meet
        changing Force Protection Conditions (FPCON)?
        1.1.2. Safety. Does the unit safety program facilitate unit readiness?
        1.1.3. Security. Were adequate measures employed throughout the exercise? Were
        Operation Security (OPSEC) procedures incorporated into plans and followed throughout
        the exercise? Were proper Communication Security (COMSEC) materials available, as
        specified in tasked operations plans, to ensure mission accomplishment? Were
        COMSEC, Computer Security (COMPUSEC) and other measures employed to deny the
        enemy information?
        1.1.4. Communications and Information. Were these operations effective?
        1.1.5. Training. Were units properly trained and equipped to perform wartime duties?
     1.2. Readiness Criteria (RC). Areas deemed necessary by functional managers that require
     special vigilance and are important to the overall performance of the unit. Not adhering to
     RC could result in some negative impact on mission performance. Standard sentence case is
     used to identify RCs.
2. Applicability. All items in this checklist are assigned an applicability code designating the
wing/unit/installation to which the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following
USAFE main operating bases (MOB): Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein,
Lajes and Spangdahlem. Applicability code 7 designates all Geographically Separated Units
(GSU) with Logistics Readiness functions (Supply, Transportation, Logistics Readiness Planning
and Policy).
