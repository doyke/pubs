     Exception: Equipment at base golf courses that have certified pesticide applicators. (T-2)
  4.7. Contracting for Pest Management Services.
     4.7.1. Use pest management contracts when more cost effective than in-house services.
     All pest management contractors must use IPM identified in the installation pest
     management plan and comply with the pesticide applicator certification, licensing, and
     registration requirements of the state or country where the work is performed. (T-0)
     4.7.2. The MAJCOM PMC will review and approve all performance work statements.
     Installation personnel must receive MAJCOM PMC approval before a request (including
     GPCs and AF IMT 9, Request for Purchase) is made for procuring commercial pest

     management service (including base operations support, General Services
     Administration, subcontracts, or other support service contracts that utilize pesticides).
     (T-2)
     4.7.3. The CE contract management office will work with the installation contracting
     office to ensure all prospective contractors send proof that all their personnel have current
     state                   pesticide                  applicator                   certifications
     (http://aec.army.mil/usaec/pest/certificates00.html) for the types of operations
     specified in the contract statement of work prior to starting work. (T-2)
     4.7.4. The prospective contractor must operate in compliance with all state and local
     regulations. All pest management contractors must also comply with sections of DoDI
     4150.07 and contents of this instruction that apply to contract pest management
     operations. Only state-certified contract pesticide applicators may mix or apply pesticides
     on CONUS Air Force installations. For overseas installations outside U.S. jurisdiction,
     follow the country FGS or OBEGD for pest management contract requirements. At
     contingency locations outside U.S. jurisdiction, follow Geographic Combatant Command
     or MAJCOM policy as applicable as set forth in environmental annexes to operational
     orders (OPORDS) or operational plans (OPLANS). (T-0)
     4.7.5. The contracting officer and IPMC must approve the location where pesticides are
     mixed and/or stored prior to starting work. This site should have secondary containment
     and backflow prevention as identified in AFPMB TG No. 17. The contractor will ensure
     this area is properly managed to prevent spills. (T-1)
     4.7.6. The contractor must comply with all applicable parts of Title 29, Code of Federal
     Regulations (CFR), Occupational Safety and Health Standards, Part 1910; Title 29, CFR,
     Safety and Health Standards for Federal Service Contracts, Part 1925; Title 40, CFR,
     Parts 150-189, and Title 49, CFR, Hazardous Materials Regulations, Part 171, while on

     safe environment for the occupants of Air Force facilities. (T-0)
     4.7.7. Certified pest management shop personnel will help the QAE evaluate pest
     management contracts. (T-2)
        4.7.7.1. QAEs themselves must receive training in pest management according to
        guidance in DoDI 4150.07. If an installation’s total pest management contract efforts

        installation is not mandatory. (T-0)
        4.7.7.2. The contractor will furnish the QAE with labels and SDSs for all contract
        pesticide materials 25 days prior to the start of the contract. The QAE will submit
        labels and SDSs to the MAJCOM PMC for approval at least 15 days prior to the start
        of the contract. Any request during the contract period to use unapproved pesticides

Terms
Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB)—A Directorate of the Office of the Deputy
Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), the AFPMB recommends
DoD policy, provides scientific advice, and enhances coordination among DoD components on
all matters related to pest management.
Direct Supervision—Supervision that includes being at the specific location where pest
management work is conducted; providing instruction and control; and maintaining a line-of-
sight view of the work performed. Certain circumstances may temporarily remove the line-of-
sight view of the application of pesticide from the supervisor, such as topographic constraints,
vegetation constraints, or building structural constraints. Under these temporary circumstances,
the supervisor shall be responsible for the actions of the pesticide applicator.
Disease Vector—Any animal capable of transmitting the causative agent of a human disease;
serving as an intermediate or reservoir host of a pathogenic organism; or producing human
discomfort or injury, including (but not limited to) mosquitoes, flies, other insects, ticks, mites,
snails, and rodents.
Installation Pest Management Supervisor/Coordinator (IPMC)—Installation pest
management supervisor or natural resources manager for the installation that is designated by the
installation civil engineer (in accordance with MAJCOM guidance) to serve as the IPMC with
responsibility for developing and updating the installation pest management plan. The IPMC will
also review installation pest management contracts and the monthly pesticide use (active
ingredient) reports submitted to the MAJCOM PMC. Pesticide chemical requests will be
provided to the IPMC for review to ensure compliance with hazardous materials management.
Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP)—A plan based on ecosystem
management that describes and delineates the interrelationships of the individual natural
resources elements in concert with the mission and land use activities affecting the basic land
management plans; defines the natural resources elements and the activities required to
implement stated goals and objectives for those resources.
Integrated Pest Management (IPM)—A planned program incorporating continuous
monitoring, education, record keeping, and communication to prevent pests and disease vectors
from causing unacceptable damage to operations, people, property, materiel, or the environment.
IPM includes methods such as habitat modification, biological control, genetic control, cultural
methods, mechanical control, physical control, regulatory control, and the judicious use of least-
hazardous pesticides.
Invasive Species—An alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or
environmental harm or harm to human health (E.O. 13112).
Noxious Weed—Any plant or plant product that can directly or indirectly injure or cause
damage to crops (including nursery stock or plant products), livestock, poultry, or other interests
of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, natural resources, the public health, or the environment.
 24                                                        AFI32-1053 20 NOVEMBER 2014


Nuisance Wildlife—Wildlife that damages property, impedes installation operations, or
endangers public health and safety to the point where control measures are required. This
category excludes wildlife species protected by the Endangered Species Act or Migratory Bird
Treaty Act. All wildlife control efforts should be conducted in accordance with AFI 32-7064 and
appropriate regulatory authorities.
Pests—Arthropods, birds, rodents, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, viruses, algae, snails, marine
borers, snakes, weeds, or other organisms (except for human or animal disease-causing
organisms) that adversely affect readiness, military operations, or the well-being of personnel
and animals; attack or damage real property, supplies, equipment, or vegetation; or are otherwise
undesirable.
Pest Management Consultant (PMC)—Professional DoD pest management personnel located
at component headquarters, field operating agencies, MAJCOMs, facilities engineering field
divisions or activities, or area support activities, who provide technical and management
guidance for the conduct of installation pest management operations. Some pest management
consultants may be designated by their component as certifying officials.
Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE)—A quality assurance inspector who is an Air Force
employee, trained in pest management, who protects the government’s interest through on-site
performance evaluation of commercial pest management contracts or other contracts that involve
the use of pesticides.
