               NUCLEAR SURETY STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT PROGRAM

1.1. Scope of the Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visit (NSSAV) Program. The Secretary of
the Air Force established the NSSAV program to assist nuclear tasked units, on a non-attribution
basis, in maintaining effective nuclear surety programs. The NSSAV is an opportunity to receive
assistance from experienced headquarters personnel who write nuclear surety policy and
guidance. It is not an inspection nor is it intended to prepare units to pass Nuclear Surety
Inspections (NSI). NSSAV will not give a rating, score, grade, or assessment statements about
units, however if the NSSAV team identifies significant observations, they can recommend that
the wing conduct root cause analysis of each significant observation and provide results to the
NSSAV lead division or team chief. NSSAV team chief will determine which MAJCOM
identified write-ups require a formal root cause analysis. Assessment statements will be limited
to processes and procedures. Attachment 2 outlines typical areas observed during an NSSAV.
Wing commanders may use the NSSAV results to strengthen the unit Nuclear Surety Program.
MAJCOMs will designate a division (lead division) as Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
for the NSSAV program to include root cause analysis follow up. This division will coordinate
with other HQ divisions on nuclear surety staff assistance visit policy issues and guidance.
Applicable HQ staff agencies act as offices of collateral responsibility (OCR). The NSSAV also
provides an opportunity for resolution and clarification of issues between the unit and
headquarters functional managers. The objective is threefold:
     1.1.1. Determine if higher headquarters guidance is adequate and clear.
     1.1.2. Provide feedback to the wing commander on whether the unit is properly applying
     sound procedures to implement Nuclear Surety guidance.
     1.1.3. Provide situational awareness on command nuclear surety to senior leadership in the
     form of an NSSAV executive summary and annual crossfeed report.
1.2. Assistance Areas. NSSAV team assesses all areas included in CJCSI 3263.05, Nuclear
Weapons Technical Inspection, and AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities as supplemented.
Additional areas may be assessed by MAJCOM staffs as time permits or when requested by
MAJCOM/CC or wing leadership. At Joint Bases where USAF is a supported component,
installation support is a sister service responsibility and USAF may not control elements of the
Nuclear Surety program at that installation. NSSAV team will either include sister service
members to evaluate supporting processes and procedures, or forward team observations to the
Joint Base chain of command.
1.3. Method of Assessment.
     1.3.1. For Technical Operations, NSSAV team members will select maintenance teams for
     each specific technical operation based on team/crew integrity.
     1.3.2. Team integrity for the weapons load crews will be maintained IAW AFI 21-101,
     Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-202, Missile Maintenance
     Management, requirements. To demonstrate their knowledge and proficiency, they will
     normally be tasked to perform at least one evaluation of a maintenance operation within their
AFI91-121 19 AUGUST 2013                                                                       5


   area of responsibility. Loading Standardization Crews and Squadron Lead Crews will be
   observed by the NSSAV team.
   1.3.3. For Weapon Security, NSSAV functional area experts will use performance based
   methodology to determine whether a unit meets the Nuclear Weapons Security Standard
   (NWSS). They will observe the integrated execution of security actions and response
   (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable. They will observe
   execution of applicable plans and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). They will
   assess the effectiveness of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems, and other
   technology. They will assess the use of available options to deny unauthorized access to
   nuclear weapons. If denial is not achieved, the ability to prevent the loss, theft, damage or
   destruction of nuclear weapons will be assessed. NSSAV functional area members will
   develop or validate wing planned exercises are realistic scenarios to determine the wing’s
   ability to meet the NWSS. NSSAV team will assess the adequacy of and compliance with
   approved compensatory measures for MAJCOM approved security deviations.
   1.3.4. Random nuclear surety testing will be administered, as per AFI 91-101, to a minimum
   of 25 percent of available personnel certified under the Personnel Reliability Program in the
   wing/unit (i.e. not on TDY/leave).
   1.3.5. A minimum of 5 percent of personnel and medical PRP records will be reviewed for
   compliance with governing DoD and AF guidance. NSSAV team will review the
   administrative qualifications, certification, continuing evaluation, removal from PRP duties,
   return to duty, and training and management processes, using record reviews to substantiate
   above processes employed by the unit. PRP processes, not records reviews will be the
   primary focus.
   1.3.6. Command Post Controller and COMSEC TPC Team Member closed book testing will
   be administered at bases with a strategic (USAFE: Non-Strategic Nuclear Forces Command
   Post) tasking to 80 percent of available certified controllers and COMSEC TPC Team
   Member (i.e. not on TDY/leave or just ending a 12-hour CP shift).
   1.3.7. MAJCOMs will determine additional items to be observed during the NSSAV based
   upon wing commander input, NAF input and on unique mission requirements.
   1.3.8. For Active and Classical Associate/Total Force Integration (TFI) units, the active duty
   unit will have responsibility for the associate/TFI unit outlined in this instruction. For
   Reserve Association/TFI units, the active duty unit will have responsibility for the Reserve
   Associate/TFI unit outlined in this instruction.
1.4. NSSAV Trip and Event Scheduling.
   1.4.1. The lead division schedules all unit NSSAVs and coordinates with appropriate
   MAJCOM agencies. These visits should occur 12 to 14 months after each unit’s last NSI.
   This interval provides a mid-course assessment point between no-notice NSIs while
   minimizing the probability of an NSI occurring prior to a scheduled NSSAV. For example,
   if an NSI occurs in Jul 12, the next NSSAV should be scheduled between Jul-Nov 13. SAV
   scheduling should follow Gatekeeper rules IAW 90-201. The only exception to this
   scheduling guidance is when a wing commander requests an NSSAV. Exception: USAFE
   may deviate from this schedule as required to accommodate host nation requirements and the
   Functional Expert Visit Program.
 6                                                                 AFI91-121 19 AUGUST 2013


     1.4.2. MAJCOMs will provide a notification message to the NAF/Center and unit 60 days
     prior to the planned visit confirming NSSAV date, lead division point of contact (POC),
     billeting, transportation and team work center requirements (provide an info copy to the
     installation-owning MAJCOM if NSSAV is for a tenant unit). Units will appoint an NSSAV
     POC and forward the name to the MAJCOM within one week of receiving the notification
     message.
     1.4.3. Units will locally coordinate and provide inputs on a proposed NSSAV Sequence of
     Events (SOE). Units will send a draft SOE to the MAJCOM NLT 40 days prior to the
     scheduled visit. MAJCOMs will ensure the proposed SOE fulfills NSSAV requirements and
     coordinate the proposed SOE within the staff. NSSAV team members will coordinate
     functional area specific scheduling requirements with their unit POCs. A confirmed SOE will
     be completed by the unit and submitted to the MAJCOM NLT 14 days prior to NSSAV team
     arrival. After the visit and events SOE is confirmed, any scheduling conflicts must be
     immediately brought to the attention of the MAJCOM NSSAV POC for resolution.
1.5. NSSAV Funding. MAJCOMs will advocate for an adequate annual budget and manpower
to fund all TDY costs associated with providing NSSAV visits to all nuclear wings within 12-14
months after a full NSI. The NSSAV budget should be managed by the lead division.
MAJCOMs will determine guidance for compensation of civilian NSSAV team members
working overtime during the visit.
1.6. NSSAV Team Composition and Requirements.
     1.6.1. MAJCOMs will determine the required size of NSSAV teams. NSSAV team members
     are drawn from applicable MAJCOM and ANG staff agencies. When necessary or desired,
     other units and/or organizations may augment the team. MAJCOMS will determine the
     priority for units from which to draw augmentees. Actual NSSAV team size, composition,
     and requirements will vary according to base and assigned nuclear mission. The team should
     consist of a cross-functional areas and commands that contribute to nuclear surety at the wing
     receiving the NSSAV. MAJCOMs will determine team composition for each base that
     receives an NSSAV. Team Composition will include members of the ANG when NSSAV
     involves ANG personnel and assets.
     1.6.2. The division chief of the lead division will normally be the NSSAV team chief.
     MAJCOMs may designate other personnel as NSSAV team chiefs where appropriate (i.e.
     limited NSSAVs, division chief availability, etc).
     1.6.3. If available, host wings will provide on base billeting for NSSAV team members. Off
     base billeting for military members must be approved by the team chief prior to team arrival.
     1.6.4. Government owned vehicles will be provided for team member transportation.
     MAJCOMs will determine standard requirements. EXCEPTION: At USAFE MUNSS sites,
     HQ USAFE will establish vehicle requirements for NSSAV team members.
     1.6.5. MAJCOMs will determine work center requirements. This work center will be
     accessible to NSSAV team members at all times.
1.7. NSSAV Duration and Meetings. MAJCOMs will determine the duration of NSSAVs
based on mission requirements. Direct interaction between team chief, all team members, the
AFI91-121 19 AUGUST 2013                                                                      7


wing or unit commander and respective staff is highly encouraged to ensure the NSSAV
efficiently accomplishes its objectives.
   1.7.1. The NSSAV team should receive an in brief from the host wing or unit commander
   and key staff. This in brief will normally include:
       1.7.1.1. Unit mission brief for NSSAV team members.
       1.7.1.2. Any local condition and safety briefings required by the unit (if not
       accomplished upon NSSAV team arrival).
   1.7.2. The NSSAV team chief may provide a formal in brief to the host wing or unit
   commander.
   1.7.3. The team chief conducts an out brief with the wing or unit commander and designated
   unit staff. The out brief location is determined by the wing commander.
   1.7.4. Time permitting, functional team leads should conduct an out brief with the
   appropriate unit commander.
1.8. Unit Preparation. Units should execute self-inspection checklists in reviewable areas prior
to the arrival of the NSSAV Team. This will allow NSSAV members to assist in resolving any
problems found and serves as a check on completeness of the wing's self-inspection checklists.
   1.8.1. Units will provide a copy of their simulations/deviations to the NSSAV team NLT 30
   days prior to the scheduled visit. The NSSAV team chief(s) will approve/disapprove
   simulations at least seven days before the visit commences. (T-1).
 8                                                                 AFI91-121 19 AUGUST 2013

               NUCLEAR SURETY STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT SUMMARY

2.1. NSSAV Report.
     2.1.1. NSSAV reports assist the units in identifying strengths and areas for improvement in
     order to enhance overall nuclear surety effectiveness. Identified deficiencies will reference
     governing instructions and guidance (i.e. AFI, MAJCOM Instructions, T.O., USSTRATCOM
     Publications, etc.) NSSAV reports will be classified IAW CJCSI 3263.05 Enclosure F, para
     2.
     2.1.2. The NSSAV team project officer uses inputs provided by each functional team
     member to build the report in accordance with the contents listed at Attachment 2. The
     NSSAV team chief will provide a draft copy of the NSSAV report to the wing commander
     prior to the team’s departure and provide a copy to the lead division upon return to the staff
     location. The authority for further distribution resides with the wing and/or MAJCOM/CC.
     The Air Force Safety Center, AF/A10, MAJCOM Directorates and Special Staff,
     Associate/TFI MAJCOM, NAF/Center CCs will receive a semi-annual crossfeed report NLT
     1 April and 1 October each calendar year. The report will include a sanitized listing of
     significant observations, observations, recommended improvement areas, and
     strengths/techniques identified in the NSSAV reports. The lead division retains an office
     record copy on file, and has the option to distribute detailed reports outside of the division
     with the approval of the MAJCOM/CC. To preserve NSSAV program integrity, the report
     will not be distributed to the Inspector General (IG) but, report contents may be shared with
     the IG if approved by the unit commander. Additionally, to preserve program integrity,
     NSSAV team members will not be used as IG augmentees at a wing/unit where they have
     performed an NSSAV in the past 12 months. (T-1).
     2.1.3. Team members include all safety, security and weapon system reliability related
     observations in the detailed report. Observations will be referenced by published guidance,
     with paragraph number to maximum extent possible. Overall and sub-area ratings are not
     assigned. Observations are classified in the following categories:
        2.1.3.1. STRENGTH - An observation that highlights strong processes, knowledge, or
        performance.
        2.1.3.2. SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATION - Any deficiency having or likely to have a
        major negative effect on the nuclear weapons mission of the activity.
        2.1.3.3. OBSERVATION - Any deficiency not meeting, having or likely to have a major
        negative effect on the nuclear weapons mission of the activity, but requires corrective
        action.
        2.1.3.4. RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENT AREA - These leave behinds are
        suggestions to improve a process (Does not require referencing governing instruction or
        guidance).
     2.1.4. MAJCOMs will determine the guidance for recognizing Superior Performers.

2.2. MAJCOMs will determine any tracking requirements and the need for follow-up
reports on any observations identified during Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visits.
2.3. Crossfeed Reports. Lead division will publish semi-annual Nuclear Surety Crossfeed
Trends and Analysis Report. These reports will identify deficiencies and their associated root
cause(s) and corrective action(s), but will not attribute the deficiency to a particular wing.
NSSAV crossfeed reports will be classified IAW CJCSI 3263.05, Enclosure F, para 2. (T-1).
   2.3.1. Semi-Annual Crossfeed reports will be distributed to MAJCOM/CC, MAJCOM
   NSSAV Division Leads, NAF/Center CCs, AFSEC/SEW, and all subordinate units at which
   NSSAVs occur NLT 1 April and 1 October each calendar year. In addition, lead division
   will provide these semi-annual (CY) Crossfeed report NLT 1 April and 1 October each
   calendar year to other MAJCOMs having a nuclear surety mission, MAJCOM A10 and HAF
   A10 and MAJCOM A9 for posting in a nuclear surety lessons learned database. (T-1).
   2.3.2. MAJCOMs will determine an appropriate forum for discussing NSSAV-highlighted
   trends on an annual basis.
