1. Overview.
 2                                               EDWARDSAFBI16-303 3 DECEMBER 2013


     1.1. The 412 TW program priority assignment system is designed to provide the most
     effective use of 412 TW resources by identifying the relative importance of competing
     programs. The 412 TW priority assignment system is based on higher-level references
     concerned with formally designated DoD programs. Further, the 412 TW program priority
     system enables 412 TW to set the relative priority of programs not specifically identified in
     the references. It recognizes overall program or project importance, as well as the specific
     needs of individual programs or projects.
     1.2. The 412 TW Program Priority Assignment process begins upon receipt of a customer
     test support request or upon direction from higher headquarters. The most commonly used
     test support request format is the Program Introduction document (PI).
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     2.1. The 412 TW Commander (412 TW/CC) has the authority to assign local urgency codes
     based on test project priority and/or the requirement to efficiently manage 412 TW resources.
     This authority may be delegated to 412 TW Vice Commander (412 TW/CV) or 412th
     Operations Group Commander (412 OG/CC).
     2.2. The 412th Operations Group (412 OG) will utilize 412 TW program priority codes to
     schedule limited resources required to conduct test operations.          Priority exceptions
     (scheduling lower priority projects over high priority projects) are permitted on a case-by-
     case basis to optimize 412 TW project throughput.
     2.3. The 412 TW Test Management Division, Resource Planning and Analysis Branch (412
     TW/TMGB) has responsibility for the administration and management of 412 TW program
     priority assignments.
     2.4. All other 412 TW organizations will utilize 412 TW program priority codes to resolve
     resource schedule conflicts between competing programs for non-test and test support
     activities. This publication does not apply to aircraft maintenance functions governed under
     applicable Air Force and Air Force Material Command instructions.
3. Procedures.
     3.1. The 412 TW program priority code is based on DoD FAD, AF precedence ratings and
     local urgency codes. The DoD FAD and AF precedence ratings are assigned by higher
     headquarters prior to delivery of a 412 TW customer support request. 412 TW urgency code
     is assigned locally to allow special emphasis to be placed on a program temporarily to avoid
     work stoppage, missed milestones, contract overruns, or delay in fielding critical operational
     capabilities. Table 1 in Attachment 2 provides the guidance for assigning 412 TW Local
     Urgency and Program Priority codes.
     3.2. Upon receipt of a test support request, 412 TW/TMGB will review applicable program
     documentation to determine each program’s FAD and AF precedence and assign an initial
     priority code to the program’s Job Order Number (JON). All new programs will be initially
     assigned a 412 TW Local Urgency Code of “C”.
     3.3. Within one month of planned ground or flight test execution, the test Project Manager
     will submit a request to the 412 TW/TMGB JON Desk to upgrade the Local Urgency Code
     to “B”. The JON desk will make appropriate updates in JON Management System and notify
     412 OG. Upon completion or cancellation of test execution, the test Project Manager will

  notify 412 TW/TMGBA to change the 412 TW Local Urgency Code back to “C” and make
  appropriate updates in the JON Management System.
  3.4. Only the 412 TW/CC or designee can approve a Local Urgency Code of “A”.
     3.4.1. All requests for a priority upgrade, including those from an external customer, will
     be reviewed and submitted by the Combined Test Force (CTF) director and forwarded
     to 412 OG/CC for approval.
     3.4.2. CTF requests will include appropriate justification, impacts, and requested
     timeframe. The 412 OG/CC will submit the request to 412 TW/CC or designee for final
     approval. Upon approval, 412 OG will direct 412 TW/TMGBA to make appropriate
     updates in the JON Management System.
     3.4.3. A project designated by the 412 TW/CC as a test acceleration or test surge will be
     assigned an Urgency Code “A”. However, the 412 TW/CC or designated authority may
     assign an Urgency code “A” for projects which are not designated as test acceleration or
     test surge.
     3.4.4. When the Urgency Code is no longer required, the CTF or 412 OG will notify 412
     TW/TMGBA to make appropriate updates in JON Management System

Terms
412 TW Priority Code.—A numerical code (“01” through “18”), derived from a combination of
the importance code and the urgency code, used to determine the allocation of 412 TW
resources.
EDWARDSAFBI16-303 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                             5


412 TW Urgency Code.—Also known as the Urgency of Need Designator (UND), this is an
alphabetic code (“A” [highest], “B” or “C” [lowest]) assigned by the 412 TW to express the
urgency of a requisitioned item’s use. (See Attachment 1.)
DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation, Appendix 9. Outlines
priority assignment process for DoD resources using the Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue
Priority System (UMMIPS). UMMIPS designates priority based on the Force/Activity
Designator (FAD).
AFI 16-301, United States Air Force Priority System for Resources Management.
Explains the structure of the AF priority system and the guidelines for precedence rating
assignments. AFI 16-301 categorizes the criteria used for FAD code assignments and outlines the
relationship of FAD codes to AF precedence ratings.
Force/Activity Designator (FAD). A Roman numeral between “I” and “V”. It reflects how
essential a unit or program is to the DoD’s overall mission. DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Supply
Chain Materiel Management Regulation, Appendix 9, outlines priority assignment process for
DoD resources using the Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS).
UMMIPS designates priority based on the Force/Activity Designator (FAD).
Job Order Number (JON).—The JON refers to an alpha and/or numeric designation assigned
to a project to identify a specific entity (resource) or work effort.
Priority Designator. A numerical code that identifies the priority assigned to requisition
and issue transactions (see AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 1, Part I, Chapter
24, Attachment 24A-1).
Program Introduction (PI).—The PI is the customer’s test support request and serves as the
initial planning document. It identifies the scope and duration of program activity and the test
objectives.
Test Acceleration (TA). A TA refers to a new test project in support of real—world or
exercise wartime requirements that has not yet entered the project support decision process and
requires a quick turnaround from planning through execution.
Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS).—A system used in
requisitioning and issuing materiel from the DoD and General Services Administration’s
distribution systems, as well as in moving materiel through the defense transportation system.
Through UMMIPS, the DoD governs the priority of resources used by the military departments.

       AFFTC URGENCY CODES:

       “A” - Required when the urgency is high. This code is used when an
       emergency requirement exists without which an actual work stoppage, missed
       milestone (e.g., Defense Acquisition Board decision), contract overrun, or
       unacceptable delay in fielding operational capabilities.

       “B” - Required when urgency is normal. This code is used when an immediate
       support requirement exists without which the successful completion of a test
       project may be seriously impaired.

       “C” - Required when urgency is low. This code is used when routine
       support of an assigned program, project, or task is required.
