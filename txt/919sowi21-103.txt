SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. When landing during normal duty hours, the Aircraft Commander (AC) will ensure the aircraft
   maintenance status and systems with discrepancies are reported to the 919 SOW Command Post
   (CP) prior to landing so appropriate personnel will be available for debriefing. The 919 SOW/CP
   will inform 919th Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF)/Maintenance Operations Center (MXOC)
   of landing time, landing status code, and systems requiring debrief. Maintenance 3/Production will
   notify specific work centers to report to debriefing. Aircraft being debriefed as a result of an abort
   will notify the Quality Assurance (QA) office and have responsible flight chief(s), and Maintenance
 2                                                                   919SOWI21-103 27 MARCH 2009


     3/Production present for debrief. A copy of the aircraft debrief sortie recap will be forwarded to the
     QA office with aircraft flight hours in the flight data.
     1.2. Aircraft commanders will ensure crewmembers enter all discrepancies in aircraft forms with the
     applicable Fault Code, in accordance with (IAW), Technical Order (T.O.) 1C-130H-2-00FR-00-1,
     Fault Reporting, for the system write-up, and ensure a completed original copy of Air Force
     Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is given to the
     debriefer. Debrief sections will have accessible the aircraft fault reporting manuals to help identify
     fault codes and speed fault isolation. The AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
     Document, discrepancy block should include enough details to be clearly understood by maintenance
     personnel.
        1.2.1. When fault reporting manuals are not published for the weapon system, input No Fault
        Code (NFC) and then the Work Unit Code (WUC) into Integrated Maintenance Data System
        (IMDS) on screen #161, i.e. NFC76000
     1.3. Maintenance debriefing is conducted immediately upon crew arrival at the debriefing section.
     All maintenance debriefings at home station will be conducted in the debriefing section. When an
     aircraft returns after normal duty hours and maintenance is not available to debrief, the debrief will
     be conducted at the beginning of the next duty day. When maintenance is not available for debrief,
     the flight crew may be contacted to clarify any discrepancies. When landing after duty hours with
     engine discrepancies, request the aircraft commander park on power engine run spot.
     1.4. Aircraft commanders will ensure aircraft forms are delivered to debriefing section accompanied
     by the crewmember with the discrepancy write-up. Debriefer will conduct and maintain control of
     the debriefing.
     1.5. In the event that IMDS is not operational at home station for debriefing, 919 SOW Form 17,
     Debriefing and Recovery Data, will be utilized for the debrief write ups. When IMDS becomes
     operational, the write ups from the 919 SOW Form 17 will be inputted into IMDS by the debrief
     section as soon as possible.
2. Debriefing Discrepancies while Cross Country or Deployed.
     2.1. Debriefing is a review of applicable AFTO Form 781 series forms and documentation of all
     applicable debriefing forms. The senior maintenance person on the cross country or deployed aircraft
     is responsible for the debrief actions on all cross country or deployed aircraft.
     2.2. Prior to cross country or deploying, the senior aircraft maintenance person will report to
     debrief/MXOC area and sign out a debrief kit. The debrief kit will consist of, as a minimum, a
     laptop computer with IMDS capability, AFTO Form 781A and any other equipment necessary to
     complete the debrief action.
     2.3. The senior aircraft maintenance person will debrief every flight using 919 SOW Form 17 when
     IMDS is not available on cross country or the deployed location. If after the flight no discrepancies
     are found, write “Ok Flight” on the 919 SOW Form 17. When IMDS is not available, each
     discrepancy will be assigned a manual Job Control Number (JCN), see attachment 2 for assigned
     numbers. The senior aircraft maintenance person will place a note on the 919 SOW Form 17 next to
     the discrepancy stating “write up completed cross country”.
     2.4. If IMDS is not available at the cross country or deployed location for the debriefing, the senior
     aircraft maintenance person will fax the 919 SOW Form 17, and the AFTO Form 781 to MOC at
     home station after each debrief for processing into IMDS. After the discrepancy is inputted into
919SOWI21-103 27 MARCH 2009                                                                            3


   IMDS, the shop will complete the job in IMDS. Flight Chiefs are responsible for the expedient
   completion of IMDS.
   2.5. Upon return to home station from cross country or deployed location the senior aircraft
   maintenance person will accompany the flight crew to debrief and assist in debriefing that mission.
   After the flight crew is finished debrief, the senior aircraft maintenance person will review and turn
   in the remaining 919 SOW Form 17s.
3. Debriefing Functional Check Flights (FCF) and Operational Check Flights (OCF). Debriefing
of FCF/OCF will be held in the QA conference room and a QA representative will assist the FCF
debrief. QA is responsible for the completeness of the FCF checklist and documentation of the AFTO
Form 781A for the FCF.
   3.1. When cross country or deployed without QA, the senior maintenance person will act as the FCF
   focal point. The senior maintenance person will sign out a FCF package from QA when a FCF may
   be required i.e.; Terrain Following (TF) Radar component has been removed and replaced.
   3.2. Upon return to home station the senior maintenance person will brief QA on the FCF and QA
   will review all documentation for completeness of the FCF flown off station.
4. Impoundments.          If aircrew is terminating a mission as a result of actual or potential mishap,
impoundment by Production Supervisor for a safety investigation is mandatory as per 919 SOWI 21-
108. NOTE: A potential mishap is defined as any incident which caused damage to the aircraft, injury
to personnel, or presents a significant hazard to the aircraft or crew.
5. Prescribed Forms.
919 SOW Form 17, Debriefing and Recovery Data
6. Adopted Forms.
AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document
AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document
