     1.1. Only individuals directly involved in the management, making safe, troubleshooting, or
     repair of impounded aircraft or equipment, or their related records, are authorized access to
     such aircraft/equipment.
     1.2. Unless conditions require an aircraft or piece of equipment to be isolated in an area
     away from the normal maintenance activities, all impoundment processes will be
     conducted/performed on the 94th AW flight line or in hangar bays. The Impoundment
     Official (IO) will be the decision authority for the relocation of impoundment exhibits.
2. Impoundment Terms: See Impoundment Procedures in AFI 21-101 and AFI 11-2C-130V3.

        3.1.2. An Air Drop Malfunction/Incident occurs (QA, Stan Eval, Wing Tactics and Wing

        investigated the next morning by QA, Stan Eval, Wing Tactics and Wing Safety.
        3.1.3. An aircraft is away from home station and encounters a problem warranting an

     all agencies are notified of the impoundment.
     5.2. An ECP will be established following an aircraft ground or flight related mishap as
     defined in AFI 91-204 or as required by the Impoundment Authority.
