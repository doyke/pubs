emergency, notify the incident commander; otherwise, the Maintenance Operations Center will
notify the Command Post to request EOD.

3. Time Standards for EOD Responders:

3.1.2. After duty hours, the standard for response to on-base incidents is within 90 minutes.

3.1.3. For emergencies at Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field (AFAF) or Air National Guard
facilities, the standard for response is within 3.5 hours.

3.1.4. For transportation accidents involving federally controlled explosive material occurring
on public highway, EOD must be on-scene within 4 hours of notification.

4. Responding to Requests from Civil Agencies:
4                                                  LAFB1 32-3001 4 MAY 2009

4.1. The Army is primarily responsible for assisting civil authorities with military ordnance.
However, the service that first becomes aware of a situation involving military or federal
explosive ordnance, must take action to prevent or limit damage or injury.

4.1.1. EOD will not respond to requests from private citizens. These requests are referred to
civil law enforcement who will verify the call and contact the Command Post for assistance.

4.1.2. If a request for EOD support is a result of an initial report of a transportation accident
involving DoD owned ammunition or explosives, the Command Post must immediately notify
the 56 MSG Commander.

4.2. If the situation involves non-military or non-federal explosives, responsibility remains with
the civil authorities. The Command Post notifies the 56 MSG Commander. The 56 MSG
Commander may dispatch Air Force assets, in the interest of the public safety.

4.3. As required the 56 MSG Commander, or designee will accompany the team, to make risk
decisions and assign incident categories for non-military or non-federal explosives ordnance.
The commander’s presence is not normally required for render safe, pickup, and or disposal of
military ordnance found by civil authorities.

4.4. Legal advice may be required to manage liability issues or environmental concerns. This
information may be acquired on-scene, by phone, or a legal representative may accompany the
EOD team at the 56 MSG Commander’s discretion.

4.5. The Command Post should notify the Public Affairs Office (6-6011) of off-base EOD
responses.

5. Storage and Disposal of Non-Military Explosives or Munitions: EOD will not assume
responsibility for storage or disposal of non-military explosives or munitions unless a valid life-
threatening emergency exists, or a Memorandum of Understanding is in effect with the agency
that has the material (i.e., the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms).
