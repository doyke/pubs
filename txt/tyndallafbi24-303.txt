This instruction implements established procedures for reporting all Air Force vehicle accidents
and abuse as required in AFPD 24-3, Operation, Maintenance, and Use of Transportation
Vehicles and Equipment. These procedures also provide guidance for Vehicle Maintenance,

responsibilities in reporting and reducing vehicle accidents and abuse. This instruction
establishes local policy to identify, report, and correct mishaps that result in damage to
government owned/leased vehicles (GOV). It also provides for reimbursement of repair costs

be attributed to fair wear and tear. It applies to all organizations supported by the 325
MSG/LRDTM, Vehicle Maintenance. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,

otherwise. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. GUIDELINES. The following actions shall be taken when a vehicle sustains damage not
attributable to fair wear and tear.
     1.1. Vehicles damaged by accident, abuse, misuse, neglect or any other cause shall be turned
     in to Vehicle Maintenance as soon as the damage is discovered.
     NOTE: When involved in a motor vehicle accident, on or off-base, operators are required to
     notify the 325th Security Forces Squadron (SFS) Law Enforcement Desk at 283-2254. The
     325 SFS will then notify Wing Safety and the Staff Judge Advocate. If the accident is off-
     base, local police must also be notified. Accident forms should be filled out at the scene.
     See your vehicle control officer to ensure proper forms are in the vehicle and for additional
     instructions.
     1.2. When Vehicle Maintenance receives a vehicle with damage that cannot be attributed to
     fair wear and tear, Maintenance Control and Analysis will send a letter to the commander of
     the using organization stating the damage must be investigated in accordance with AFMAN
     23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. A copy of the letter will be sent to 325
     FW/SE, 325 FW/FM, 325 SFS/CC and 325 FW/JA.
     1.3. Vehicle Maintenance personnel will take photos of the damage to assist the unit in the
     investigation. Unless otherwise requested by the using organization, repairs normally begin
     after 24 hours.
2. REIMBURSEMENT FOR VEHICLE DAMAGE.
     2.1. IAW AFI 24-302, 1.20.1, the 325 MSG/LRD shall be reimbursed for vehicle damage as
     a result of accident and abuse. Reimbursement will include only parts and direct labor, or
     total contracted repair costs.
     2.2. Within 15 days after the end of each month, Vehicle Maintenance will submit to
     Accounting and Finance a letter with affected organizations and dollar amounts to be
     transferred to the 325 MSG/LRD account.
