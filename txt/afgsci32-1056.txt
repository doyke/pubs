                AIRFIELD OBSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM


Section 1A—General Information
1.1. Overview. Physical airfield infrastructure encompasses design, markings, lighting, signage,
pavement, lateral and vertical clearances, drainage, transportation and arresting systems. Criteria
are established regarding each of these elements in DOD and/or Air Force guidance. When those
criteria must be violated, then a waiver is required. Waiver approval is reserved for significant
mission requirements, conditions or situations for which no viable, practical alternatives exist.
Requests for waivers of fixed wing and rotary wing airfield planning and design criteria other
than construction and air show waivers require AFGSC approval. Note: The term “airfield” in
this instruction addresses facilities for both fixed wing and rotary operations unless otherwise
specified.
1.1.1. Waivers. Approvals of waivers to violations of criteria are considered for airfield required
facilities/equipment only when no other feasible alternatives exist and facility or equipment is
required to be sited in violation of criteria to meet mission requirements. Waivers must be
submitted to HQ AFGSC/A7P (Civil Engineer Programs Division) for review/approval before
design start. Requests for permanent airfield and intrusion into airspace waivers require an
evaluation of alternatives; must clearly show no other feasible alternatives exist; and must
describe the precautionary measures for mitigating the accepted risk.
Section 1B—Responsibilities
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities. Waivers processed for AFGSC consideration will be initially
prepared, coordinated and approved at the installation level, following locally developed
procedures for processing and approving these types of waivers and then submitted to HQ
AFGSC/A7P for notice or for approval, as appropriate.
1.2.1. Airfield Working Group. The installation commander or equivalent shall establish an
Airfield Working Group (AWG). Chaired by Airfield Management (AM), at minimum
representation shall include members from Safety (SE), Civil Engineer (CE) Programs Flight
(CEP), CE Asset Management Flight (CEA), CE Operations Flight (CEO) and Terminal Enroute
Procedures (TERPS).
1.2.1.1. Waiver Review. The installation commander must ensure that the AWG will: review the
number and status of permanent/temporary airfield waivers, the status of deteriorating
airfield/runway conditions and brief the Airfield Operations Board (AOB) in accordance with
(IAW) AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs. The Operations Support
Squadron commander or a designated representative shall notify the Base Civil Engineer (BCE)
or a designated representative, of proposed AOB meetings. The BCE or designated
representative will attend all AOB meetings.
1.2.1.2. Airfield Advocate. The AWG monitors and processes waiver requests and proposes
projects to eliminate waivers. The AWG advocates for funding to improve airfield conditions
through the Transportation Networks and Airfield Pavements Plan Manager and the Facilities
Board (FB). The AWG requests Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) studies and
AFGSCI32-1056 22 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   3


provides technical and policy support for any airfield related Joint Land Use Studies that are
conducted. IAW Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4165.57, Air Installation
Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ), military departments are required to develop, implement and
maintain an AICUZ program for installations with flying operations. AICUZ studies are to be
updated in accordance with AFI 32-7063, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Program. The
BCE or designated representative is responsible for the AICUZ program.
1.2.1.3. Annual Inspection. The AWG conducts the annual airfield certification/safety inspection
and presents annual airfield waiver review to Facilities Board (FB). The AWG should
complement and coordinate with other mandated forums such as the Installation Encroachment
Management Team.
1.2.1.4. AWG Training. Members of the AWG must accomplish and document training in the
individual’s training records. It is recommended that each member receive annual recurring
training on airfield/airspace waiver criteria. All AWG members must complete the Air Force
Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) Airfield Criteria Course for Civil Engineers, Airfield
Managers and Wing Safety computer-based training (CBT). AWG members must complete the
Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) Airfield Inspections/Maintenance CBT and the
Operational Risk Management (ORM) Fundamentals course found in the ORM University
located on the USAF Risk Management Information System website at
https://rmis.kirtland.af.mil. Completion of the Advanced Airfield Managers course is strongly
recommended for AWG primary team members.
1.2.2. Base Civil Engineer. The BCE is responsible for physical airfield infrastructure. The
annually updated Air Traffic System Evaluation Program checklist found at AFFSA Community
of Practice (CoP) provides useful overview of regulated airfield infrastructure elements that are
the responsibility of CE.
1.2.2.1. CE Training. AFGSC and installation CE staff personnel assigned airfield planning and
design responsibilities must complete AFCESA Airfield Criteria Course for Civil Engineers,
Airfield Managers and Wing Safety. HQ AFCESA/CEOA provides the course files.
1.2.2.2. AFGSC Civil Engineer Staff. HQ AFGSC/A7P is responsible for coordination and
review of waivers, managing the AFGSC airfield waiver internet repository and providing
GeoBase support. The AFGSC Community Planner is the action officer for management of the
waiver review process.
1.2.2.3. AFGSC Review. HQ AFGSC/A7P coordinates requests for waivers and the annual
waiver review at a minimum with the following HQ AFGSC Directors: Safety (SE); Airfield
Operations (A3, including Airfield Manager – A3B); Installation, Logistics and Mission Support
(A4/7); and Communications (A6). Additionally, includes coordination with ACC TERPS
located at Langley AFB, before submitting waiver requests to the AFGSC approving official.
1.2.2.4. GeoBase Support. At the Installation level, it is required that CE, Airfield Management
and Safety accurately identify the status of features and facilities on airfield maps as exempt
(constructed under previous, less stringent standard), permissible deviation (authorized as
deviation and sited correctly) or as a violation IAW UFC 3-260-01, 1-4.1., Appendix B, Section
1, B1-2.1.1. A map of approved waivered items and mapped Building Restriction Line (BRL) is
to be part of the annual review IAW UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 1, B1-2.5.4.3. Consult
AFI 32-10112, Installation Geospatial Information and Services (Installation GI&S), to clarify

responsibilities of maintaining the mission data layers and providing map support.
Section 1C—Existing Conditions
1.3. Existing Facilities. Certain existing airfield facilities may have been located or constructed
under previous standards. If determined to be exempt, such existing facilities need not be
modified nor upgraded if they meet current mission essential requirements, meet applicable
frangibility and other requirements and comply with criteria in UFC 3-260-01, Chapter 1,
Section 1-4.
1.3.1. Exempt Facilities. IAW AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning, installation
personnel must identify the status of features and facilities on the appropriate map series as
exempt. Exempt facilities and features are not intended to be expanded, but may be
reconstructed. The BRL encompasses vertical facilities along the flight line that are exempt
because they were constructed under previous standards. All exemptions must be documented
with photos, age of construction, location, etc. in accordance with Section 3B Waiver Contents.
1.3.2. Permissible Deviations. Installations must ensure all violations of airfield planning and
design criteria classified as permissible deviations comply with deviation criteria in UFC 3-260-
01, Appendix B and Section 13-2.
1.4. Marking Obstructions. Regardless of the status of the waiver, all objects or structures that
penetrate an airfield imaginary surface, as described in UFC 3-260-01, must be marked IAW AFI
32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory
Circular 70/7460-1K, Obstruction Marking and Lighting, so they are conspicuous during day
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions. In addition, the objects or structures penetrating the
airfield imaginary surfaces must also have a red obstruction light installed IAW UFC 3-535-01,
Visual Air Navigation Facilities. Any deviation from these requirements must be programmed
for correction and will require an airfield waiver.
1.5. Airfield Obstruction Reduction Initiative (AORI). All correctable violations of airfield
criteria, regardless of classification (waiver, exemption or non-classified), must be programmed
for elimination IAW HQ USAF AORI guidance and identified in the wing’s Base
Comprehensive Asset Management Plan and the Automated Civil Engineer System database.

Civil Engineer is the approval authority for new land use or facility construction within the Land
Use Control Area of the 3000’ x 3000’ end of runway clear zone that IAW AFI 32-7063.
Locally approved siting requests must be submitted to HQ AFGSC/A7P for final staffing and
approval by AFGSC/A7C, via email to HQ AFGSC/A7P Workflow with attached request and
also by uploading to AFGSC airfield waiver internet repository. The graded area of the clear
zone and the Mandatory Frangibility Zone must be managed IAW UFC 3-260-01.
2.8.1. Clear Zone Siting Requirements. All requests for clear zone siting must be fully justified,
include a risk assessment with mitigation strategies to reduce risk, and include a diagram or
sketch of the facility location within the runway’s clear zone.
2.9. Facility Siting within Accident Potential Zones. Land use within the clear zones and
accident potential zones, on and off base, must be managed IAW the AICUZ program
guidelines. These guidelines are designed to protect the installation’s flying mission and to
encourage local municipalities to manage off-base development within these zones to protect the
public from the noise and safety impacts created by aircraft operations. Installations should refer
to UFC 3-260-01 Appendix B, Section 3 to determine recommended appropriate land uses.
2.10. Aircraft Parking Plans. Revisions to aircraft parking plans, GeoBase/Comprehensive Plan
map, do not require AFGSC approval as long as no violations of Air Force criteria result from
their implementation. Violations of criteria associated with implementation of aircraft parking
plans require AFGSC/CV waiver approval. Aircraft parking areas should be evaluated by the
Airfield Working Group to identify violations or deviations to airfield design criteria (such as
markings, obstructions, and wing tip clearance violations) that will require corrective action or
waived by the appropriate waiver approval authority. Note: See AFI 11-218_AFGSCSUP for
additional guidance on waivers to aircraft operations within the vicinity of airfield obstructions.

3.4.1. Waiver numbering will be cumulative, so if there are already six existing permanent
waivers on the taxiway at Whiteman AFB, then the next number of a new permanent waiver in
2011 would be 11YWHGPWT7. At the option of the installation, a maximum of three
alphanumeric characters, inside ( ) may be used to further identify the location of the waiver on
the airfield (example: (DE) = DELTA EAST) resulting in a waiver identified as 11YHGPWT7
(DE). In summary, waiver names will equal A+B+C+D+E plus an optional F.
