     1.5.2. During normal operations, the approach end Runway 01/19 E5 cable and BAK12
     cable shall be disconnected and pulled to the side of the runway.
     1.5.3. When Runway 12/30 is closed or its approach end BAK12 is unusable for a
     significant period due to outage or weather, the E5 on the approach end of Runway 01/19
     shall be disconnected and pulled to the side and the approach end BAK12s shall be
     connected until such time Runway 12/30 becomes active again.
     1.5.4. The approach end BAK12, departure end BAK12, and departure end BAK9 shall be in
     place on Runway 12/30 at all times.
     1.5.5. Vertical-lift Aircraft Operations.
        1.5.5.1. Location of vertical-lift aircraft Pads.
            1.5.5.1.1. Hover Point. Located on Taxiway M between Runway 01/19 and Taxiway
            R for use by base assigned and transient vertical-lift aircraft. When in use by vertical-
            lift aircraft, it shall be closed to all other traffic.
            1.5.5.1.2. Hospital Pad. Located northwest of the 96th Medical Group Hospital (Pad
            lights shall be turned on by Eglin Tower upon request).
        1.5.5.2. Departures and Arrivals. All departures and arrivals shall be in accordance with
        clearance as issued by the appropriate ATC agency.
        1.5.5.3. Traffic Patterns. Clearance must be obtained prior to entering a Class D Surface
        Area or traffic pattern at fields where traffic is being controlled. When approach or
        departure route will require crossing a runway or its extended centerline, obtain clearance
        from the control tower before crossing. Traffic patterns may be adjusted to take
        advantage of existing winds when approved by the control tower.
        1.5.5.4. Landing pad and patterns entry for local flights.
            1.5.5.4.1. Departures and arrivals to and from the north shall be over Tom’s Bayou,
            avoiding Valparaiso and Niceville schools and hospitals.
            1.5.5.4.2. Departures and arrivals to and from the south shall follow a route between
            Runway 01/19 and Taxiway to King Hangar, then east, parallel to Runway 12/30 to
            the bay coast, remaining clear of Test Site A22.
Note: Patterns in paragraph 1.5.5.3. do not preclude the pilot requesting a straight-in approach
when traffic permits, nor do they restrict the tower from changing flight patterns as necessary for
traffic or safety of flight reasons.
        1.5.5.5. Training at Eglin AFB (Main). Vertical-lift aircraft VFR training and functional
        check flights (FCFs) are authorized at Eglin (Main). Two-way radio contact must be
        maintained with Eglin Tower or the Eglin Range Control Facility (ERCF). The west end
        of Taxiway M (West) and adjacent Taxiways are designated vertical-lift aircraft
        transition areas. Traffic patterns may be varied, as necessary, to take advantage of
        existing winds. Avoid over-flying the munitions storage areas.
            1.5.5.5.1. Auto-rotations. Vertical-lift aircraft test and practice auto-rotations shall
            be conducted in the following areas only:
                1.5.5.5.1.1. Active runways, with tower approval.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                     9

1.6. Eglin AF Auxiliary Field Number 3 (Duke Field, EGI). Refer to Figure 1.2.
   1.6.1. Operating hours are established in the IFR Supplement. Fire/rescue services are
   available 24 hours a day. The 711 SOS does not require scheduling coordination for use of
   the ALZ. These aircrews can simply request real-time operations with the Duke Tower.
   Other AFSOC assigned aircraft will coordinate use of the ALZ through 919 OSS/DOO (DSN
   875-6550) and schedule appropriate airspace (EGI.L14) through 1 SOG/OGO. Aircraft from
   other MAJCOMs must have the appropriate waivers on file with 919th SOW for the lack of a
   safety zone and AMP-2 and AMP-3 lighting IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone
   Operations. Once the waivers are on file, aircrews will contact Duke Field Base Operations
   (DSN 875-6538) for PPRs and coordination.
      1.6.1.1. If test missions require the use of Duke Field outside normal operating hours,
      prior coordination must be made to the Airfield Ops Flight Commander 24 hours in
      advance.
10                                       HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


     1.6.1.2. Requests for operations at Duke Field for other than published hours shall be
     submitted to the Eglin Airfield Operations Flight Commander (46 OSS/OSA) at least 5
     calendar days in advance, in writing.
     1.6.1.3. Duke Tower may open later and close earlier than as specified, provided the 46
     TW, 53 WG, and 919 SOW have no flying activity to support. Duke Base Operations
     shall ensure the appropriate Notices to Airman (NOTAM) are issued for late opening,
     early closing, and weekend operation.
     1.6.1.4. All assault zone operations will be suspended during FARP and emergency
     operations being conducted at the intersection of taxiways Foxtrot and Delta.
  1.6.2. Aircraft larger than a C-130 are prohibited from using taxiways on the east side of the
  runway without prior coordination from Duke Base Operations. C-130 and larger aircraft are
  prohibited from making 180 degree turns on the runway or assault landing zone.
  1.6.3. C-5 aircraft operations must be coordinated with Duke Base Operations in advance for
  taxi routing and parking space assignment. C-5 aircraft are prohibited from parking at the
  hot cargo pad/upload area and from operating on the parallel taxiway adjacent to the 919
  SOW parking area anytime other aircraft or equipment are in place on Bravo row.
  1.6.4. The E5 arresting cable shall be in place at the departure end of the runway for normal
  ops.
  1.6.5. Vertical-lift Operations.
     1.6.5.1. Pilots shall contact Duke Tower for clearance into or departure out of the east
     transition area. Pilots shall monitor tower frequency during all operations. This area
     shall not be authorized for more than four vertical-lift aircraft at any one time. Once in
     the area, pilots are responsible for maintaining their own separation from other vertical-
     lift aircraft, and clearances for successive approaches are not required. All vertical-lift
     aircraft operations will be suspended during FARP/emergency/ALZ operations.
     1.6.5.2. Traffic patterns shall be flown at or below 700 feet MSL unless a higher altitude
     is approved by Duke Tower. Vertical-lift aircraft shall fly a right-hand pattern when
     departing/landing to the north, and a left-hand pattern when departing/landing to the
     south. Traffic patterns shall not be flown within 600 feet east of Runway 18/36 without
     authorization from ATC. Landings shall normally be made on Taxiway D (East)
     southeast of Taxiway F (East).
         1.6.5.2.1. Duke Tower shall:
             1.6.5.2.1.1. Provide initial clearance to and from the east transition area, if able.
             1.6.5.2.1.2. Advise aircraft of any mission activity that would cancel vertical-lift
             aircraft operations.
             1.6.5.2.1.3. Advise crash station to stand by for vertical-lift aircraft operations.
             1.6.5.2.1.4. Advise the vertical-lift aircraft of changes in weather, wind, altimeter,
             and vehicles and personnel entering the landing area.
             1.6.5.2.1.5. Personnel and vehicle operators requiring access to the east transition
             area shall be briefed by Duke Base Operations to remain clear of the landing area.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                        11


     1.6.5.3. Training at Duke Field. Vertical-lift aircraft (VFR) training missions (including
     external cargo sling) are authorized in the east transition area at Duke Field (Figure 1.2).
     This area is bordered by the assault landing zone on the west, Taxiway F (East) on the
     north, the tree line on the east and south to the airport boundary. The area north of
     Taxiway F (East) includes the engine test area and effluent spray field, and is not
     included in the east transition area.
         1.6.5.3.1. Vertical-lift aircraft night landings may be made in the east transition area
         when portable lights are in place and illuminated. Note: Portable lights shall not be
         used for night vision imaging systems (NVIS) training. Pilots shall advise the tower
         when conducting NVIS training.
         1.6.5.3.2. Auto-rotations. Vertical-lift aircraft test and practice auto-rotations shall
         be conducted in the following areas only:
             1.6.5.3.2.1. East transition area.
             1.6.5.3.2.2. Active runways and assault landing zones, with tower approval.
             1.6.5.3.2.3. Designated autorotation landing areas shall be accessible to crash
             recovery crews on normal duty or special standby.
             1.6.5.3.2.4. Tower clearance shall be obtained prior to climbing above normal
             traffic pattern altitude.
  1.6.6. ALZ Description. The ALZ is a hard surfaced runway. It is 60 feet wide and has a
  useable runway length of 3,500 feet. Beyond these dimensions, there is 300 feet overrun on
  each end (a total of 4,100 feet of pavement). There is no Safety Zone as described in AFI 13-
  217, paragraph 3.6.4. Note: (AFSOC Waiver). The ALZ is located parallel to and 1,000 feet
  east of the main runway at Duke Field. See Figure 1.2. for DUKE ALZ diagrams.
     1.6.6.1. Runway Lights/Markings:
         1.6.6.1.1. Day. White lines have been painted on the ALZ to designate the
         beginning/end of the useable portion of the runway. Orange panels can be setup to
         identify a bi-directional daytime AMP-2 configuration, with a 500-foot landing area
         box. Contact Duke Field Base Operations, (DSN 875-6538).
         1.6.6.1.2. Night. The ALZ has runway lighting installed that offers aircrews lighting
         options of AMP-2, AMP-3, or Blacked-Out (no lights, no markings, AMP-4, etc).
         The AMP-2 and AMP-3 landing area boxes are 500 feet long. The AMP-2 lights are
         overt white lights. The AMP-3 lights are covert infrared (IR) lights. These runway
         lights also have five different intensity levels for aircrew to choose from (levels 1
         through 5).
             1.6.6.1.2.1. For added training benefit, the nighttime AMP-2 lighting is designed
             to display /light only 3,000 feet of runway. Depending on the runway direction,
             the entire AMP-2 lighting pattern shifts 500 feet to accurately display/light only
             3,000 feet of runway, beginning at the start of the useable portion of the runway.
             Beyond the departure end of the AMP-2 lights, aircrew will actually have another
             800 feet of pavement that is not lit. Therefore, aircrew must ensure the correct set
             of AMP-2 lights are displayed for direction of takeoff/landing (i.e. ALZ 18 or
             ALZ 36), or the ALZ will be shortened 500 feet because of the lighting shift
12                                  HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


        (although there is always be 3,000 feet of useable runway available). This can be
        a factor when flying an approach to the ALZ then circling to land opposite
        direction. This shift only occurs for the AMP-2 nighttime settings. The AMP-3
        settings always display the full 3500 feet of useable runway for NVG landing
        operations.
     1.6.6.1.3. Control of Lights. The ALZ runway lights can be controlled by the Duke
     Air Traffic Control Tower. They can also be controlled by a Landing Zone
     Controller (LZC) via a lighting control pedestal located near the ALZ.
     1.6.6.1.4. Tower Coordination. Use the terminology ―ALZ‖, ―LZ‖ ―Landing Zone‖,
     ―Assault Strip,‖ etc., to identify to Tower your intentions to use the ALZ. Include the
     runway direction (18 or 36) and your desired AMP setting with your request. For
     example, ―Tower, Goose 71 requests to land on ALZ 18 with AMP-2 lighting.‖ The
     ALZ is not an approved instrument runway. Therefore, Tower will only accept VFR
     operations to the ALZ. Simultaneous same direction operations (with the main
     runway) are authorized. Simultaneous opposite direction operations are NOT
     authorized. The VFR pattern will conform to the existing VFR traffic pattern at Duke
     Field.
     1.6.6.1.5. Visual Illusion. Aircrews should be aware of a visual illusion when
     landing on ALZ 18. A small hill is located north of the ALZ on short final. The
     ground slopes down to the ALZ threshold causing illusions of a graded-in glide path.
     1.6.6.1.6. Restrictions. Aircrews must obtain approval from their squadron
     commander or operations officer prior to conducting takeoffs from the ALZ.
     1.6.6.1.7. Caution. Aircrews are reminded that this is an actual 60-foot wide assault
     strip. Extra care should be used when calculating TOLD and briefing crewmember
     actions during emergency procedures.

Figure 1.5. Hurlburt Field.




1.8. Local Flying Area. The local flying area consists of several pieces of special use airspace
and other designated areas, as listed below (Figure 1.6). The Eglin ―E‖ Military Operations
Area (MOA) includes the airspace encompassed by R2915A, B, and C; R2918; R2914A and B;
R2919A and B; the North-South Corridor; and the East-West Corridor, surface to, but not
including FL180. Airspace within the lateral boundaries of R2917, surface to FL230, is not
included in the Eglin ―E‖ MOA.
   1.8.1. Functional Check Flight Areas. Any available Eglin airspace.
   1.8.2. Eglin ―A‖ MOA. (Figure 1.6). This area is designated for controlled ingress and
   egress from R2915A and applies only to aircraft under the control of Eglin Radar Control
   Facility (ERCF) that, because of mission profile, cannot be contained in R2915A during
   turns and transitions. This area shall be called up automatically by ERCF for the requested
   altitude(s) if the profile for the mission reflects utilization of that airspace. The base altitude
   is charted at 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL). Occasional use of the ―A‖ MOA to 200
   feet AGL is authorized by notice to airmen (NOTAM). Altitudes up to, but not including
   10,000 are normally available. Upon request, Jacksonville Center may approve up to but not
   including FL180. NOTE: The ―A‖ MOA is divided into an east and west section. The west
   section lies within Pensacola Approach’s airspace and requires 15 minute prior coordination
   by Eglin Approach for use. The Navy Whiting Class C airspace is not part of ―A‖ MOA.
   1.8.3. Eglin ―B‖ MOA. (Figure 1.6). This area is designated for controlled egress and
   ingress and applies only to aircraft under the control of ERCF that, because of mission
16                                        HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


  profile, cannot be contained in R2914A, R2915A, or R2918 during turns and transitions.
  This area shall be called up automatically by ERCF for requested altitude(s) if the profile for
  the mission reflects utilization of that airspace. The base altitude is charted at 1,000 feet
  AGL. Occasional use of the ―B‖ MOA to 200 feet AGL is authorized by NOTAM.
  Altitudes up to, but not including 10,000 feet are normally available. Upon request,
  Jacksonville Center may approve up to, but not including FL180.
  1.8.4. Eglin ―C‖ MOA. (Figure 1.6). This area is designated for controlled egress and
  ingress and applies only to aircraft under the control of ERCF that, because of mission
  profile, cannot be contained in R2914A during turns and transitions. This area shall be called
  up automatically by ERCF for the requested altitude(s) if the profile for the mission reflects
  utilization of that airspace. The base altitude is charted at 1,000 feet AGL. Occasional use of
  the ―C‖ MOA to 200 feet AGL is authorized by NOTAM. Altitudes up to, but not including
  10,000 feet are normally available. Upon request, Jacksonville Center may approve up to,
  but not including FL180.
  1.8.5. Eglin ―D‖ MOA. (Figure 1.6). The ―D‖ MOA is designated to provide airspace for
  the control of aircraft transitioning from the Clear Springs initial point (IP) to Eglin Test
  Range C62, within R2914A, and from R2914A to the IP. This MOA was designed to be
  used in conjunction with Eglin ―C‖ MOA. Use of the area is coordinated through the ERCF
  with a minimum prior notification of 15 minutes required. Altitudes in the area are from
  1,000 feet AGL to 3,000 feet MSL.
  1.8.6. Eglin ―F‖ MOA. (Figure 1.6). This area is designated for controlled penetration of
  the small triangular area on the western boundary of R2915B by mission aircraft under
  control of ERCF that, because of mission profile, cannot be contained in R2915A, B, or C.
  This area, depending on altitude required, shall be called up automatically by the ERCF for
  the requested altitude(s) if the profile for the mission reflects utilization of that airspace. The
  base altitude is charted at the surface. Altitudes up to, but not including FL180 are available
  in the ―F‖ MOA; Jacksonville Center may approve higher altitudes on request.

Figure 1.6. Special Air Traffic Rule (FAR Part 93) Airspace.




   1.8.7. Eglin North-South Corridor. Airspace within these boundaries is governed by Federal
   Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 93. To operate in the North/South Corridor, an aircraft must
   receive permission from the ERCF and maintain two-way radio communications with the
   ERCF or an appropriate ATC facility. This area is designed to facilitate aircraft movement to
   and from Eglin Main, Duke Field, Hurlburt Field, Destin and the Fort Walton Beach Airport.
   This area is also used in conjunction with the eastern complex, western complex, or both
   complexes to support special mission requirements. (The corridor is depicted in Figure 1.6,
   surface to unlimited).
   1.8.8. Eglin East-West Corridor. Airspace within these boundaries is governed by FAR Part
   93 rules. (This corridor is divided into three sections to accommodate the different altitudes
   as portions of the corridor underlie restricted areas R2915C, R2919B and R2914B). The east
   and west corridor extends from the surface up to, but not including 8,500 feet MSL as
   depicted in Figure 1.6 Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, no one shall operate an aircraft
   within the East-West Corridor without establishing two-way radio communications with the
   ERCF and receiving a traffic advisory. The East-West Corridor facilitates access to airports
   in the Eglin Fort Walton Beach area.
   1.8.9. Eglin Western Range (2915) Restrictions and Transit Procedures for Vertical Lift
   Aircraft. AFSOCs Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) operations in Choctaw’s Class D eastern
   ring presents a safety hazard to aircraft transiting between Choctaw and R-2915A over
   Highway 87. Additionally, terminal operations at Watering Head HLZ may be in conflict
   with AFSOC RPA operations at Choctaw. When transitioning north or south between
   Choctaw NOLF and along the Western edge of R-2915A, aircrews will adhere to the
 18                                      HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


   following procedures: (1) When flying northbound, transmit to Choctaw Tower on UHF
   frequency 380.8 (VHF secondary 121.4) at the southern reporting point, East Bay (Figure
   A171.1) with call sign, altitude, direction of travel, and intentions (i.e. ―VODKA 72, East
   Bay, 300ft, transiting north‖). Inform tower of intentions to use Watering Head HLZ if
   applicable. During Class G operations at Choctaw, transmissions on these frequencies will
   still be made for situational awareness for RPA and AFSOC aircraft. (2)When flying
   southbound, transmit to Choctaw Tower on UHF frequency 380.8 (VHF secondary 121.4) at
   the northern reporting point, Yellow Bridge (Figure A17.1.1) with call sign, altitude,
   direction of travel, and intentions (i.e. ―VODKA 72, Yellow Bridge, 600ft, transiting south‖).
   Inform tower of intentions to use Watering Head HLZ if applicable. During Class G
   operations at Choctaw, transmissions on these frequencies will still be made for situational
   awareness for RPA and AFSOC aircraft. (3) Aircrews will not fly west of the north/south
   running power lines which mark the eastern edge of Choctaw’s Class D airspace and the
   eastern most point of the RPA flight profiles unless cleared to do so by Choctaw tower
   (Figure A17.2.1). (4) Due to the limited lateral clearance of this transition, northbound
   traffic should be 500 feet AGL and below and southbound traffic should be 600 feet AGL
   and above. Lower or higher required altitudes can be flown if company traffic can be
   confirmed well clear.
Note: Watering Head HLZ traffic should remain at 300 feet AGL and below when operating
outside of R-2915A. (5) Radio communication with Choctaw tower is required. When Choctaw
tower is not manned the reporting point calls will be made on 380.8 for advisory. (6) Terminal
operations at Watering Head HLZ must be scheduled through 1 SOG/OGO. A new range profile
for Watering Head operations has been created. Terminal operations at this HLZ will not be
conducted without Eglin Mission approval and a mission number (Figure A17.3.1). (7)
Transition procedures remain the same when inbound for Watering Head HLZ. The only caveat
being a report to Choctaw with estimated time at the HLZ and reporting departure with altitude
and direction (reporting point or range). (8) Pilots will review Choctaw NOTAMs (KNFJ) and
check airspace status. Anytime Choctaw’s Class D airspace is active (tower manned) it should be
assumed that RPA operations are present, day or night. During hours of tower closure, Choctaw
airspace reverts back to class G and RPA operations are only allowed during daylight hours. At
night, unmanned aircraft cannot fly in class G uncontrolled airspace. (9) During Class D
operations, RPA operations encompass the East half of the Class D ring from SFC – 1500ft
AGL. Aircraft working Watering Head HLZ will not make patterns further west than the power
lines paralleling Highway 87. CV-22s should remain in helicopter mode. (10) During Class G
operations, UAS are allowed to operate within the same lateral boundaries but with a vertical
limit of SFC – 700ft AGL and only during daylight hours. At night during Class G, vertical-lift
aircraft are not limited to the Western power line restriction (CV-22s may operate in airplane
mode).

  1.9.4. UAS missions will be conducted under shared-airspace guidelines, and UAS
  controllers will maintain contact with Eglin ROCC (WOLF CALL) on UHF 276.0 at all
  times. UAS controllers maintain responsibility for avoiding active A-77 profiles.
  1.9.5. 1 SOG crews planning to use R2915A will check 1 SOG/OGO Range products for
  awareness of scheduled R2915A.L123 profiles.
  1.9.6. 1 SOG crews will check in on 276.0 prior to entering the airspace defined in
  Paragraph 1.9.2 above. This check-in will be accomplished regardless of scheduled L123
  profile. When L123 profile is active, crews will relay their intentions, to include estimated
  time within the profile. EXAMPLE: ―Cowboy 21/22 at or below 500 feet, vicinity of
  Watering Head for 15 minutes, transit to A-77.‖ Aircraft departing Watering Head after
  ground-lager will announce intentions on 276.0 prior to lift-off. ALL AIRCREWS
  MAINTAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR VISUAL SEPARATION OF AIRCRAFT AT ALL
  TIMES WITHIN MISSION AIRSPACE.
  1.9.7. The following frequencies have been provided by 1 SOG/OGO via Eglin Range
  Control for use by all PC-12/U-28 aircraft when operating in the Eglin Range Complex; Field
  1 Ground team frequency: 123.525, Field 6 Ground team frequency:123.250. If desired, PC-

1.10. Hurlburt Tower Operating Area (TOA). (Figure 1.9). The Hurlburt TOA is that
airspace within a 5 nautical mile radius of the geographical center of the airport, excluding that
airspace which lies east of the eastern boundaries of R2915B and R2915C, extending from the
surface, up to, but not including 2,500 feet MSL.
   1.10.1. Aircraft operating within the Hurlburt Field VFR pattern are directed to utilize VHF
   tower frequency (126.5) to the maximum extent possible. Upon entering the Hurlburt Class
   D airspace, aircrew members will report VFR to tower and state type of training desired.
   1.10.2. The Hurlburt Tower will implement the use of VFR re-entry points depicted in
   Figure 1.10 The VFR re-entry points will be utilized by the tower when a conflict is
   encountered. Upon the direction of the controller, aircraft will ―break out‖ of the pattern and
   comply with the following instructions:
       1.10.2.1. VFR holding/re-entry points EIFFEL (N3023.583 W8645.966) and CUTOFF
       (N3024.650 W8639.283) will be used for VFR holding or pattern re-entry only. When
       instructed to proceed to either point, Runway 36 traffic will make a climbing left turn to
       2200 feet and proceed direct EIFFEL or a climbing right turn to 2200 feet direct
       CUTOFF and Runway 18 traffic will make a climbing right turn to 2200 feet direct
       EIFFEL or a climbing left turn to 2200 feet direct CUTOFF. Holding at these points will
       be away from the airfield and the direction of turns will be left (West) for EIFFEL and
       right (East) for CUTOFF.
   1.10.3. 1 SOSS tower personnel have identified the greatest density traffic occurs in the local
   pattern between 1800-2400L. During these periods of high density traffic, aircrews are
   advised to utilize alternate airfields such as Duke and Eglin.

                                             Chapter 2

               COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS (C3).

2.1. WOC Organization. The WOC is the 1 SOW command and control agency responsible
for flight following, deviations, emergencies, and mission coordination. The WOC includes the
following: the 1st Special Operations Maintenance Coordination Center (MCC), the 1 SOCS
Radio Room (RR), 1 SOG Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and, when activated, the Battle staff and
the Aircraft Generation Boiler Room.
   2.1.1. Command Post (―Chindit Ops‖). Located in the WOC building and responsible for
   Command and Control of 1 SOW aircraft to include flight following and status reporting.
   Radio communications to WOC agencies will be through RR personnel, call sign ―Emerald.‖
   The RR will also respond for the command post (CP) call sign ―Chindit Ops‖ when the RR is
   manned. When the 1 SOCS Radio Room is not manned, the WOC Command Post will
   assume the responsibilities outlined in paragraph 2.1.2. Note: For aircrew there is no
   difference as to which agency/call sign responds to radio calls to the WOC. WOC internal
   communications procedures will ensure requests or information is correctly routed,
   responded to, or acted upon.
   2.1.2. Supervisor of Flying. The SOF in the WOC serves as the 1 SOW/CV representative
   for all flying missions. The SOF monitors all flying activity and acts as liaison between
   aircraft commanders and local tankers. The SOF also serves as the flying coordinator
   between aircraft and base transportation, ammunition, parking, and aircraft emergencies.
2.2. Procedures. Unless directed otherwise by higher headquarters, the procedures outlined in
this chapter will be the same during home station training flights, deployments, exercises, and
real-world contingency operations.
   2.2.1. Secure voice is the primary mode of operation, but all radio circuits will be capable of
   both secure and non-secure operation. EXCEPTION: During home station training flights,
   non-secure communications are primary; however, aircrews will ensure aircraft radios are
   capable of secure communications.
   2.2.2. Combined execution checklist will be used by both fixed-wing and vertical-lift
   aircraft. Individual squadrons may develop their own execution checklists tailored to their
   specific mission. Coordinate squadron execution checklists with the WOC.
   2.2.3. Aircraft and ground stations will use the frequencies listed in 1 SOG/OGK Monthly
   Comm. Products for all communications to the WOC. SATCOM, when available, is the
   primary long-range communications circuit as authorized and assigned by the 1st Special
   Operations Communication Squadron Tactical Flight (1 SOCS/SCT). HF will be used when
   SATCOM is not available, and UHF or VHF may be used within line-of-sight (LOS).
   2.2.4. For all missions originating at Hurlburt/Duke Fields and Eglin AFB the aircrew will
   report to 1 SOW WOC through the Radio Room (Emerald).
       2.2.4.1. The following information will be relayed to Chindit:
          2.2.4.1.1. Actual take-off time.

          2.2.4.1.2. Hourly ―Operations Normal‖ calls (if applicable).
          2.2.4.1.3. Any in-flight conditions which would adversely affect the mission.
          2.2.4.1.4. Report 30 minutes prior to landing the following: ETA, Alpha status with
          specific maintenance codes (be sure to notify if max power run will be required) and
          any other service requirements. Use the appropriate system codes located in the
          mission folder/AFTO Form 781 when calling in a specific system discrepancy.
          Never announce any information concerning tactical or ECM equipment in clear text
          over the radio. Use of clear text for generic aircraft equipment malfunctions is
          permissible but discouraged.
              2.2.4.1.4.1. ALPHA 1 = airframe operationally ready.
              2.2.4.1.4.2. ALPHA 2 = airframe mission ready (minor problems).
              2.2.4.1.4.3. ALPHA 3 = airframe non-mission ready (major problems).
              2.2.4.1.4.4. Relay requests for ammo pick-up and crew transportation
              requirements (if needed).
              2.2.4.1.4.5. Required cargo off-loading assistance if required.
          2.2.4.1.5. Landing time (EXCEPTION: Duke and Eglin assets will report landing
          time to Duke/Eglin MOCC).
   2.2.5. The WOC will assist in coordinating the following: (Calls should be made directly to
   the 1 SOW WOC as soon as practical).
      2.2.5.1. Maintenance problems that may cause a delay or mission cancellation.
      2.2.5.2. Variations between scheduled and actual loads. (cargo, airdrop loads, fuel, etc).
   2.2.6. Diversion Guidelines. Aircraft may be dispersed, under emergency conditions, by the
   WOC broadcasting diversion instructions on assigned frequency every ten minutes.
      2.2.6.1. Weather diversions may be initiated by the flight crew, the squadron, 1
      SOG/CC, or the WOC.
      2.2.6.2. Diversions, regardless of reason, to other than scheduled landing base will be
      reported to the WOC and squadron as soon as possible.
2.3. 1 SOG/OGO Responsibilities.
   2.3.1. Notify the WOC of any changes to or cancellations of scheduled flights.
   2.3.2. Notify the WOC at least 48-hours in advance of any after hours or weekend flight-
   following support requirements.

   2.6.1. During home station training flights, ensure UHF, VHF, and HF or SATCOM (if
   available) radio checks are performed prior to scheduled departure. Radio checks will be
   performed on the operational frequencies using the operational COMSEC material and in
   both secure and non-secure modes.
   2.6.2. Relay all C2 information, IAW paragraph 2.2.4, to the WOC. The 9 SOS, being
   geographically separated, may pass this information to their operations center who will relay
   to the WOC.
   2.6.3. Use the Combined Execution Checklist See: 1 SOG/OGK Monthly Comm.
   Products and make, as a minimum, all mandatory radio calls (appropriate to the mission
   being flown) to the WOC. If no execution checklist calls are scheduled to be made, make
   ―Ops Normal‖ radio calls every 60 minutes.
   2.6.4. Monitor one WOC radio frequency at all times. SATCOM (if available) is the
   primary C2 net, but UHF/VHF/FM/HF may be used when appropriate.
   2.6.5. To minimize radio traffic, aircrew will state the net they are calling on. Example:
   ―Chindit, this is Spooky 29 on Victor. Royal at 2001.‖
   2.6.6. Aircraft commanders will call the SOF at the WOC after landing, prior to crew
   debrief, to relay takeoff and landing times exactly as shown on the AFTO Form 781 and
   Hurlburt Field Form 40. In addition, Aircraft Commanders will relay the total flight
   duration, overall mission effectiveness and a concise justification if mission effectiveness is
   less than 100 percent. Aircraft Commanders will have the Form 40 submitted to 1 SOW/CP
   NLT 2+00 after the final land time. If the AC requires more than 2+00 to accomplish post
   flight duties (debriefs, paperwork, etc), then the AC will call the SOF prior to beginning post
   flight duties and provide flight information, any significant issues, and estimated time they
   will submit the Form 40.
       2.6.6.1. Hurlburt Field Form 40 will be available for use with Patriot Excalibur (PEX),
       the unit-level software scheduling tool, used for squadron aircrew scheduling, training,
       mobilization, standardization and evaluations.
2.7. Joint Team Members Monitoring Interphone. All 1 SOG aircraft will provide a headset
and interphone cord to joint team members to monitor appropriate radios and interphone during
tactical events. Do not remove primary crewmembers from interphone stations to accommodate
this requirement.
   2.7.1. Joint team members will not transmit over interphone to effect changes to the mission,
   call ―no drops,‖ or direct the aircraft. EXCEPTION: Jumpmaster directed airdrops when
   authorized.
 34                                      HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


      2.7.1.1. Joint team members may transmit instruction/coordination with their unit/team
      over aircraft radios if approved by the aircraft commander.
   2.7.2. Coordination must be made between the aircraft commander and senior ground force
   representative prior to engine start as to who has priority on monitoring interphone.
   2.7.3. Loadmaster/Gunner will ensure that all interphone cords are secure during tactical
   events to prevent entanglement or possible loss outside of the aircraft.
2.8. Operations/Communications Security.
   2.8.1. Static call signs will be used for local training and other non-operational CONUS
   missions. AFKAI-1 Voice Call Signs List (VCSL) call signs will be used for OCONUS and
   operational missions when communicating with the WOC and Air Traffic Control Agencies.
   2.8.2. Use secure STU-III/STE facsimile or SIPRNET e-mail communications to pass any
   classified or sensitive information via landline. Non-secure facsimiles or NIPRNET e-mail
   may be used to pass unclassified flight schedules and flight schedule changes.
   2.8.3. During home station training flights use the applicable edition and segment of the
   following:
      2.8.3.1. Use KEYMAT listed on the 1 SOG/OGK Monthly Comm. Products to secure
      SATCOM, HF, UHF, and VHF radio transmissions.
      2.8.3.2. Use KAL 269 (CONUS), KAL 9200 (OCONUS) or available training
      frequencies for HAVE QUICK II training.
      2.8.3.3. Use USKAT B13333 for OTAR operations.
      2.8.3.4. Use AKAL 1553 for authentication of diversion instructions.
      2.8.3.5. During deployments, exercises, and contingencies, use the COMSEC as
      designated in the deployment order or Communications Electronics Operating Instruction
      (CEOI).
      2.8.3.6. COMSEC material will change for all stations at 0001Z unless otherwise stated.
      In the event that COMSEC change-over occurs during the training sortie, aircrew must
      take-off with the current KEYMAT, plus any future editions. COMSEC will not be
      frozen for training missions.
2.9. Mode 4 Operations.
   2.9.1. Aircrew will preflight and in-flight check the Mode 4 for all flights. Request in-flight
   Mode 4 verification whenever possible.
2.10. Problems with Eglin Approach/Mission.
   2.10.1. If problems occurred with Eglin Approach or Mission Control, aircrew should
   request that the controller ―Mark the tapes.‖ Follow up by either calling the ERCF
   Chief/Supervisor (not the shift chief/supervisor) at 882-8160 between 0700 – 1600L. This
   must be done immediately after the flight to ensure tapes are not destroyed. For immediate
   safety concerns call the watch supervisor at 882-9151/42/53.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                           35


2.11. Posse Comitatus Act.
   2.11.1. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits using military members to execute civil law
   unless authorized by the Constitution or an Act of Congress. This prohibits military
   members from directly participating in civil law enforcement operations or subjecting
   civilians to regulatory or compulsory military power. Direct participation includes such
   things as interdiction of a vehicle, vessel or aircraft, search or seizure, arrest, apprehension,
   or the use of military personnel for surveillance or pursuit of individuals. The Posse
   Comitatus Act does not prohibit activities conducted for a primary military purpose, such as
   protection of the installation.
   2.11.2. 1 SOG aircrew are authorized to provide aid if assistance is needed on the Eglin
   Radar Control Facility (Eglin Range) and must be approved by the 1 SOW/CC prior to
   beginning assistance.
   2.11.3. If a request is received for 1 SOW aircrew or assets to assist in a search and rescue
   operation, or other activities independently justified by humanitarian purposes unrelated to
   civil law enforcement (save lives, save property, or stop suffering), the individual receiving
   the request will contact the 1 SOW Command Post (884-8100) who will coordinate the
   required approvals. Under no circumstances will aircrew participate in such events until
   approval is received. If a request is received while airborne, aircrew will contact the 1 SOW
   CP/SOF for coordination and approval.

                                           Chapter 3

                                 GENERAL PROCEDURES

3.1. VIP Flights and Static Displays. All VIP Flights and static displays are directed by the 1
SOG/CC and conducted IAW AFI 11-209_AFSOCSUP, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
Training Program. Participating crewmembers will be briefed by a designated representative of
the squadron CC/DO on duties and responsibilities. For all Distinguished Visitor (DV) flights
the WOC will be notified, through the base radio station, of ETA 30 minutes prior to landing and
again at 10 minutes prior to landing.
3.2. Aircraft Tours. Personnel not assigned to the squadron (relatives, friends, etc.) are
allowed to tour the aircraft; however, such visits will be limited to a small number of people and
be coordinated through the MOCC, and Security Police. All visits will be on a non-interference
basis. Tour groups and all airfield photography must be approved by 1 SOW/PA and
coordinated through 1 SOW WOC.
3.3. Practice Combat Maneuvers. All crewmembers will be advised of the time period when
they may expect threat maneuvers. This simulated threat time will provide maximum safety to
prevent personnel injury during the rapid changes of aircraft position. Crewmembers should be
prepared for abrupt maneuvers during any phase of flight and should remain strapped in
whenever flight duties do not require them to move about the aircraft. During training, defensive
maneuvers should not feature zero-G profiles.
3.4. C-130E Operations. Refer to MDS-Specific guidance for C-130E operations.
3.5. International Flight Planning. Use Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) call signs when
flying OCONUS. Squadron schedulers are responsible for obtaining these call signs. Use
Tactical call signs when talking to mission agencies. If scheduled to remain overnight (RON),
keep the 2-digit suffix for the entire mission and change VCSL daily. EXCEPTIONS: If a
diplomatic clearance or ALTRV is utilized, maintain assigned VCSL.
   3.5.1. International flight plans are filed a minimum of 2 hours prior to proposed takeoff.
   When possible, a formal weather briefing should be requested as a minimum of 24 hours
   prior to scheduled departure.
   3.5.2. International NOTAMS are obtained from the appropriate central NOTAM facility.
   Eglin and Hurlburt do not maintain international NOTAMS but will retrieve them with prior
   notice. Refer to FLIP, General Planning Chapter 5, to obtain the central NOTAM facility
   serving your route and destination.
3.6. Aerial Capability Demonstrations. Aerial capability demonstrations are part of our
mission. As long as we are tasked to conduct demonstrations and capability exercises
(CAPEXs), we will do them professionally to reflect standards; no more, no less. Aircrews are
to fly demonstrations the way they routinely practice with no more urgency or aggressiveness.
Commanders are to select the right aircrew, approve the profile, and personally monitor the
rehearsals and the execution. There will be no difference between show operations and normal
operations. Refer to AFI 11-209 for additional information concerning aerial demonstrations.
3.7. Ground Operations. Crews will avoid reversing outboard engines when over other than
hard surface areas. Crews will advise ground control of any actual/potential foreign object
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         37


debris (FOD) on or near any taxiway, runway, or ramp area. Use caution when taxiing behind
aircraft which have engines running, and when operating over areas with unstable surface.
3.8. Delta Taxiway Hot Gas Site. (Figure 3.1) Permanent training site approval is granted for
Delta Taxiway (Hurlburt Field, FL). All site coordination and procedures must be IAW the
current Delta Taxiway Hot Gas survey kept at 1 SOG/OGK.
3.9. Other Hot Gas/FARP Areas. Refer to current Hot Gas and FARP surveys kept on file at 1
SOG/OGK.
   3.9.1. The Hurlburt Field Hot Refuel Certification Team has approved one location for C-
   130 hot refuel operations on Alpha taxiway.
   3.9.2. The site can accommodate all C-130 MDS aircraft. The site is certified for refuel and
   defuel operations with a single C-130 aircraft to an R-11 refuel truck. Use of this site may be
   restricted by other airfield operations. All other aircraft operations will be suspended on
   Alpha taxiway during hot refueling operations. All site coordination and procedures must be
   IAW the current Alpha Taxiway Hot Gas Survey kept at 1 SOG/OGK.

                                           Chapter 4

                                   RANGE OPERATIONS

4.1. Local Flying Area. EAFBI 11-201 contains range information for crews. Pertinent data
used daily has been extracted and added to this instruction. Crews must be familiar with these
publications for safe and orderly conduct of their mission within the Eglin AFB complex.
4.2. Scheduling. Scheduled missions have priority over nonscheduled ―real-time‖ 1 SOW
aircraft. Day-of or airborne requests will be granted through coordination with the SOF to avoid
conflict with scheduled missions. Contact the SOF on CP frequency.
   4.2.1. Every attempt will be made by 1 SOG/OGO to procedurally de-conflict all 1 SOW
   range profiles by time, space, or altitude blocks.
   4.2.2. In the event that procedural de-confliction is not possible and real time radio
   controlled de-confliction is required the following must occur:
       4.2.2.1. All aircrew participating in shared airspace on the Eglin Range Complex, who
       require real time radio controlled de-confliction to ensure adequate separation between
       aircraft, will obtain information from their squadron current operations on the agreed de-
       confliction measures, assets involved, and boundaries of the profiles. It is imperative that
       the aircrew clarify any information not easily understood in the shared airspace
       agreement.
       4.2.2.2. Group current operations will inform each squadron of shared airspace requiring
       real-time radio controlled de-confliction NLT 1200L the day prior to the mission. The
       information will include at a minimum the suggested de-confliction measures, assets
       involved, and a pictorial depiction of the boundaries of the conflicting profiles de-
       confliction procedures will be included in the final version of the daily range sheets.
       4.2.2.3. Squadron current operations will review the suggested de-confliction measures,
       agree or disagree with the suggestion, and provide aircrews with the details of approved
       shared airspace agreements to include the agreed de-confliction measures, assets
       involved, and boundaries of the profiles.
       4.2.2.4. Communications with a DZ/LZ controller or other shared airspace user must be
       established prior to entering the shared airspace profile boundaries. At a minimum,
       aircraft will avoid the conflicting profile by 1,000 feet until communication with a DZ/LZ
       controller or the conflicting aircraft(s) is established and conflicts are resolved.
       4.2.2.5. Eglin Mission Control clearance into the range is NOT clearance to enter into a
       shared airspace agreement without DZ/LZ controller radio communications or direct
       communications with the conflicting aircraft, ground party, or user.
4.3. Separation of Aircraft. Aircrews are responsible for the separation of aircraft operating
under the same mission number. Aircrews are also responsible for the separation of aircraft
participating in ―shared airspace‖ missions (independent missions sharing airspace resources
with another independent mission). Flight lead control shall be used. Separation between
missions operating in adjacent airspace areas is achieved by aircrews remaining within their
assigned mission airspace. Workload and equipment permitting, Eglin Mission Control shall
 40                                      HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


assist aircrews in remaining within assigned mission airspace by providing boundary advisories
whenever an aircraft is detected on a heading which will take it outside of assigned mission
airspace: ―(CALL SIGN) WORK NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST.‖
   4.3.1. Eglin Mission Control will also apply merging target procedures, workload and
   equipment permitting. Eglin Mission Control will:
       4.3.1.1. Issue radar traffic information to aircraft whose targets appear likely to merge
       unless the aircraft are confirmed to be separated vertically by more than 500 feet.
       4.3.1.2. Issue vectors/instructions to insure the primary targets of aircraft previously
       issued as traffic do not touch. The phraseology in paragraph 4.3 may be used.
   4.3.2. Aircrews will remain within their assigned airspace/profile. Crews operating under
   Eglin Mission Control in W-151 sub areas C and D must be especially vigilant in ensuring
   they remain within their assigned airspace. Radar and radio limitations may preclude radar
   services when operating below 15,000 feet MSL in these areas.
   4.3.3. When flying nonstandard formations under Eglin Approach Control, the last element
   will squawk mode 3, code 0200 and mode C.
   4.3.4. Advise Eglin Mission Control 5 minutes prior to return to base (RTB) when departing
   from any Eglin range or the H and/or D areas.
4.4. Operations in Eglin Restricted and Warning Areas.
   4.4.1. Aircraft may proceed to the restricted/warning areas under IFR or VFR. Operations
   within the areas may be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC) or
   instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).
       4.4.1.1. All flights in the Eglin complex will be conducted under IFR to the maximum
       extent possible.
   4.4.2. ERCF may clear nonparticipating IFR aircraft through unused portions of
   restricted/warning airspace. Vertical/lateral separation (1,000 feet and 3-5 miles, as
   appropriate) will be provided from mission activity. Nonparticipating VFR aircraft may be
   cleared through unused portions of restricted airspace at an altitude that will not interfere
   with the test or training mission. Mission activity will not be restricted or curtailed to
   accommodate nonparticipating aircraft.
   4.4.3. Transit to and from the Eglin ranges must be accomplished with Eglin Mission
   Control. Clearance from Eglin Mission Control must be received prior to entering the
   restricted areas or ranges on assigned mission frequency. Attempt contact with Eglin
   Approach on 393.0 when entering from the north. Approach will clear you into the range
   and then hand you off to Mission upon your entry of the range.
   4.4.4. On initial contact, crew will relay mission number, position, area of operations, and
   activation of MOAs (if required). The Eglin Mission Control frequency will be monitored at
   all times when on the ranges. Common mission frequencies which are always monitored:
   West range: 315.0/135.25; East range: 262.3/135.25; Water range: 290.9.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                        41


4.5. R-2914A and R-2915A Procedures.
   4.5.1.1. NAS Whiting aircraft conduct numerous VFR day and night training operations in
   Alert Area 292. They also conduct operations at Crestview VORTAC (CEW), Bob Sikes
   airport and many of the Outlying Fields (OLF), surrounding R-2915A. Because of the high
   potential for a mid-air collision in this area, aircraft will comply with the following
   restrictions. If mission requirements preclude complying with these restrictions, contact
   Eglin Approach or Mission (as applicable) for clearance.
      4.5.1.2. Exercise extreme caution when flying in the vicinity of Holley OLF, Santa Rosa
      OLF, Choctaw OLF, Harold OLF, I-10, and SONTAY/B6 DZ/LZ run-in and escape
      crossing into and out of R-2915A. These areas are used extensively by Navy fixed and
      vertical-lift aircraft, both day and night. For de-confliction reporting purposes, aircrews
      will ensure they have the following points annotated on their charts:
      4.5.1.3. HAROLD N 30-40.786 W 086-52.925.
      4.5.1.4. BALDY N 30-43.748 W 086-49.031.
      4.5.1.5. RANGER N 30-46.846 W 086-46.939.
      4.5.1.6. RACETRACK N 30-42.02 W 086-48.16.
   4.5.2. Exercise increased vigilance when using SONTAY/B6 due to increased NVG
   operations by Navy Whiting helicopter traffic crossing perpendicular to DZ/LZ run-in,
   Monday – Friday, 0700-2300L. Navy helo traffic is transiting from Whiting Field NAS and
   Harold NOLF along the northern edge of R2915A to an area around Bob Sikes Airport then
   RTB, reporting Point RACETRACK (point is a tower along a power line slash), 85NM west
   of SONTAY’s run-in (See Figure 4.2).
      4.5.2.1. All aircrews will monitor VHF 121.95 (Navy helo Instructor common) while
      using SONTAY/B6. This frequency should be used to de-conflict and monitor for
      position calls; disregard other de-confliction frequencies.
      4.5.2.2. All aircrews, if able, will make a Northbound or South bound call when passing
      the Northern edge of R2915A around Point R. The Navy helos have been instructed to
      acknowledge any calls if they are working in the area, as well as passing a position
      report. When working at night, the helos will have their position lights on, as well as
      their top and bottom strobe lights.
   4.5.3. Navy ―Purple‖ Route. All aircrews exercise increased vigilance during the day when
   working around the Crestview VORTAC, north of and inside the Eglin A East and Eglin B
   MOA’s, below 300 foot AGL, due to increased activity from Navy helicopter traffic flying
   their locally created ―Purple‖ Low-Level route at 200 foot AGL and 90 knots. (See Figure
   4.3).

Figure 4.3. Navy Helo “Purple” Route.




   4.5.4. Navy traffic transiting along I-10 should contact aircraft using Aux Field 6 on
   298.025, and will make reference to these points. As an alternate means of contact, use
   389.1 or 121.95 to de-conflict with Navy traffic. (Further guidance for mid-air collision
   avoidance in the vicinity of USN OLFs can be found in paragraph 5.6.3.1 of this
   instruction.)
   4.5.5. Entering 2915A. From N31-05.00 to 10 NM north of R-2915A, maintain 1,000 feet
   MSL or lower. From 10 NM north of R-2915A until entry into the restricted area, maintain
   800 feet MSL or lower. Be alert for Navy helicopter traffic operating from N31-05.000 to R-
   2915A between point RANGER and NAS Whiting Field from 1000 feet to 3000 feet MSL.
   4.5.6. Eglin MOAs north of 2914A and 2915A begin at 1000 feet AGL, but may be
   activated as low as 200 feet AGL by NOTAM. When operating VFR north of either 2914A
   or 2915A, this NOTAM should be requested up to 1,000 feet, or higher as required by the
   mission. (Refer to Chapter 1 for information concerning Eglin MOAs. Eglin MOAs can
   only be scheduled in conjunction with 2914A and 2915A for ingress/egress of the restricted
   areas.)
4.6. Hurlburt/Eglin Departures and Arrivals.
   4.6.1. See Local HFI 13-201, EAFBI 11-201 and current FLIP.
      4.6.1.1. Hurlburt/Eglin/Duke Departures. All VFR aircraft northbound from CEW will
      depart at 3,000 feet MSL until 15 NM north of CEW (approximately N 31-05.00), at
      which point they may descend IAW the low-level route restrictions detailed in FLIP
      AP/1B. If mission requirements dictate lower altitudes on departure, fly a minimum of 3
      miles east of the CEW VORTAC unless otherwise cleared by ATC. Avoid over-flying
 44                                      HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


      Bob Sikes airport below 2,000 feet AGL or 1NM, and the city of Crestview below 3,000
      feet MSL.
   4.6.2. Hurlburt/Eglin/Duke Arrivals. All VFR aircraft southbound into CEW will maintain
   at least 3,500 feet from 15 NM north of CEW until cleared to descend by ATC. If mission
   requirements dictate lower altitudes on arrival, adhere to the avoidance restrictions listed in
   paragraph 4.6.1.1 above. (Refer to paragraph 1.8.7 of this instruction for North-South
   Corridor restrictions).
   4.6.3. Hurlburt IMC self contained approaches (SCAs) or airborne radar approaches (ARAs)
   will only be flown when using official DOD FLIP local SCA or ARA approach plates.
   Contact 1 SOG/OGV regarding disposition of these procedures.
4.7. Eglin Manned vs. Unmanned (Live Fire) Ranges.
   4.7.1. Follow these procedures for use of Eglin’s manned and unmanned ranges.
      4.7.1.1. For unmanned test areas, the Range Operations Control Center (ROCC) (Call
      sign ―Wolf Call‖) is the appropriate test area control authority. The ROCC monitors
      UHF frequency 276.0 and FM frequency 165.1875 to approve test area
      operation/ordnance delivery on unmanned test area, and as a backup point of contact for
      manned test areas. Note. Aircrews will check in, obtain clearance, and check out with
      the ROCC, but will monitor their assigned mission frequency when working the
      unmanned test area(s).
   4.7.2. For manned test areas, the Range Control Officer is responsible for the conduct and
   safety of ordnance delivery missions after obtaining assurance from the Test Area Controller
   that the gates are closed and the test area is clear of all personnel (i.e. ―DARKIN‖).
4.8. Operating at Bob Sikes.
   4.8.1. All aircraft operating VFR will perform LEFT HAND TRAFFIC PATTERNS ONLY.
   Refer to paragraph 1.19
      4.8.1.1. For noise abatement purposes all aircraft will climb to 700 feet MSL on climb
      out before turning to reenter the traffic pattern, or radar pattern. This climb restriction
      applies to RWY 35 and RWY 17.
4.9. Airdrop/Airland Operations.
   4.9.1. Field 1 (Wagner Airfield). Field 1 LZ is approved for runway 18/36 approaches and
   departures. Use easterly turnouts for multiple patterns at Field 1. IMC airdrops are
   authorized on Pino DZ. Ensure that Eglin MOAs are activated before commencing IMC
   activities. FARP is authorized at Field 1. LZ/DZ frequencies are as follows: Field 1 LZ:
   UHF 325.7 (pri) or VHF 139.85 (sec).
   4.9.2. B-6 (Biancur Airfield, TAB 6, Auxiliary Field 6). B-6 includes Field 6, Silent Night
   (assault strip), and Sontay, Khafji, and Hob Knob drop zones. Field 6 is approved for
   airdrop/airland (including FARP). 1 SOG/OGO coordinates with the ROCC for medical
   support personnel during actual personnel drops and for fire trucks during LZ work.
   Simultaneous use of Field 6 with A-77 or B-7 requires at least 1,000 feet altitude separation.
   If both the LZ and DZ are in use, STS will direct the aircrew to the proper frequency.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         45


     4.9.2.1. For multiple racetracks, right hand patterns will be flown remaining south of the
     IP and within 3 NM of DZ run-in course. Use caution when executing the right hand
     escape maneuver, to avoid NAS Whiting’s Class B airspace. Avoid over-flight of the
     Ranger Camp.
     4.9.2.2. IMC airdrops are authorized for MC-130 operations IAW weather minimums in
     AFI 13-217. IMC SCAs are normally authorized for MC 130E/H operations to RWY 18
     and 36. The IMC SCA must be contained entirely in the restricted area. See Flight Crew
     Information Summary (FCIS) for waiver specifics. Ensure that the Eglin MOAs are
     activated for any mission activity during IMC conditions.
     4.9.2.3. If, for an emergency, an aircraft operating on Field 6 needs to transit the airspace
     near range B-7, call on guard frequency (243.0 ―Range B-7 CEASE FIRE‖) and ensure
     aircraft exterior lights are on.
     4.9.2.4. At 20 NM north of the restricted area, aircraft inbound to Field 6/TAB 6 will call
     in the blind on 121.95 ―(Call Sign) is 10 NM north of Bear Lake for multiple run-ins at
     TAB6/Fld 6 at (altitude).‖ When complete with drops/landings a call in the blind on
     121.95 will also be made. Navy traffic in the area will be monitoring this frequency.
     4.9.2.5. Ensure all aircraft lighting remains ON. EXCEPTION: Anti-collision lights
     may be turned off after entering the restricted area if they distract from NVG landings.
     4.9.2.6. Clearance to drop from the DZ party is mandatory. Clearance to drop may be
     conveyed by any appropriate means (i.e. ground beacon, DZ lighting, voice).
  4.9.3. B-12 (Epler Airfield, Auxiliary Field 7). Field 7 may be used by 1 SOW aircrews
  with approval from 1 SOG/OGO. The runway must be cleared of foreign objects prior to
  fixed wing airland operations. Approaches to both 18 and 36 are available. FARP is
  approved at Field 7. Check LZ survey for the most current data. Simultaneous use of B-12
  and B-7, or B-75 requires a 1 SOG shared air agreement between participants, accepted and
  posted by 1 SOG/OGO.
  4.9.4. Field 10. (Choctaw OLF, Dillon Field, Auxiliary Field 10). Field 10 is authorized for
  use during special circumstances. It is located on the Eglin reservation, but is inside of
  Pensacola’s airspace. Prior coordination with Navy Whiting and Pensacola by 1 SOG/OGO
  is required prior to performing any operations from Field 10.
  4.9.5. Duke Field (Eglin Auxiliary Field 3).       Refer to paragraph 1.6 for Duke Field
  Operations.
  4.9.6. C-61A (Pino DZ). Pino DZ is approved for airdrop operations from the north or
  south. Use easterly turns off the Pino DZ area during multiple patterns. IMC airdrops are
  authorized. Ensure that Eglin MOAs are activated before commencing IMC activities. Pino
  DZ frequencies are as follows: UHF 266.15 (pri) or VHF 139.85 (sec).
  4.9.7. B-70 (Elizabeth and Eileen DZ). B-70 is approved for airdrop operations. Due to the
  close proximity of the other Eglin ranges, extreme vigilance is required on the escape
  maneuver. Daily mission activity should dictate which area is the safest for accomplishment
  of multiple racetracks. IMC operations are approved. Ensure that the Eglin MOAs are
  activated.

   4.9.8. D-54 (Lance) Water DZ. D-54 is approved for airdrops of personnel and equipment.
   Maximum altitude is 3,000 feet MSL for the standard profile. DZ controllers should be in a
   safety boat with the appropriate medical support personnel. IMC airdrops are approved on
   this DZ. Ensure that the Eglin MOAs are activated if approach is from the north.
4.10. AC-130 Operations.
   4.10.1. Sensor Alignment. Assigned altitudes will be as coordinated between pilot and Eglin
   Range Control Facility (ERCF). Restrictions may be imposed due to active mission airspace.
   Sensor aligning aircraft must remain within 2 NM of the alignment point when on the
   western side of the orbit.
      4.10.1.1. Offsets are only authorized to the east and south. If alignment is to be
      performed above 10,000 feet AGL, a Temporary Assigned Airspace clearance will be
      given. The 2 mile restrictions are removed if the A-78 profile is the standard profile from
      surface to 9,000 feet. The crew should request the radius of flight they will require to
      complete their alignment.
      4.10.1.2. For use of Hurlburt ―H‖ area, file BASS intersection (HRT 210/11), then direct
      HRT.
      4.10.1.3. Duke ―D‖ area is also used for alignment of sensor systems on AC-130
      gunships.
      4.10.1.4. A-77 is also available for AC-130 sensor alignment.
   4.10.2. EAFB Reservation. The Eglin reservation contains both live and dry fire ranges for
   gunship operations. Live fire ranges consist of land and water ranges. The uncontrolled land
   ranges authorized for gunship operations are A-77, A-78, and B-7. The controlled land range
   authorized for gunship use is C-52N. To ensure range safety, all uncontrolled ranges must be
   cleared visually by all available sensors, IAW paragraph 4.12. of this instruction
   (EXCEPTION: AC-130U IMC operations at approved IMC ranges). The 22 uncontrolled
   water ranges are located in W-151. On the water ranges, clear the impact area by 5 NM for
   vessels and continue to clear the area while firing.
      4.10.2.1. If radio contact is lost after firing has commenced, aircraft on water ranges may
      continue to fire until the expiration of their range time; aircraft on land ranges will cease
      fire and will not resume until communications are reestablished. EXCEPTION: If more
      than one aircraft is firing on the water range, and radio contact is lost with Eglin Mission,
      the aircraft that has lost contact will cease fire and will not resume firing until
      communications are reestablished.
      4.10.2.2. All aircraft will remain within 2 NM of the applicable range.
      4.10.2.3. All W-151 targets will be a minimum of 12nm off shore, but no farther south
      than necessary.
          4.10.2.3.1. W-151 Water Range De-confliction. When multiple gunships are on the
          water range, crews will maintain a minimum of 1000 feet vertical separation and 5nm
          lateral separation between other aircraft (final firing altitude), and will monitor the
          common mission frequency. Crews are responsible for maintaining both vertical and
          lateral separation from other gunships by all means necessary.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                        47


         4.10.2.3.2. Prior to entering W-151 for live fire operations, crews will inform the
         SOF that they plan on using the MK 25 marking flare. The SOF will in turn notify
         the Destin Coast Guard (244-7147).
     4.10.2.4. Weather for live fire operations must be sufficient for crews to observe the
     target with a visual sensor until round impact. (EXCEPTION: AC-130U on approved
     IMC live fire profile).
         4.10.2.4.1. If operating on an IMC live fire profile, and weather becomes VMC or
         partially VMC, clear targets and surrounding area radius of 500 meters (25MM,
         40MM) and 650 meters (105MM) prior to firing on that target with a visual sensor.
     4.10.2.5. If a fire starts during the live fire and does not burn itself out or is spreading
     rapidly, contact Jackson Guard through Eglin Mission for fire suppression.
     4.10.2.6. All guns will be safe and cleared prior to departing any live fire range for
     another. The lead gunner will report all guns safe and clear directly to the aircraft
     commander on main interphone.
  4.10.3. A-77. No rounds will impact within 300 meters of the bunker on A-77 or 100 meters
  of the Close Quarter Battle Site (CQBS) at any time. Ground parties may be on Range A-77
  while the AC-130 tweaks. When a ground party is on Range A-77 they will be in the
  northwest corner of the range (at the bunker, CQBS, observation tower, or MOUT site)
  during the gunship’s initial tweak. No-fire headings WILL be used when required.
     4.10.3.1. I f ground parties are present on A-77 and they are not located at the bunker,
     the aircrew will ensure that the ground parties have turned off the alignment point beacon
     prior to commencing live fire operations.
     4.10.3.2. See paragraph 1.9.1. through 1.9.8 for AFSOC UAS operations impacting
     Range A-77.
     4.10.3.3. Modifications to A-77 include an integrated urban joint close air support
     (IU/JCAS) site and paved helo landing zone (HLZ) (see Figure 4.4). The urban JCAS
     site is comprised of the observation tower, the urban JCAS impact area, and the MOUT
     site. The site was built to provide a local urban training facility for exercises such as
     Emerald Warrior (EW). When not in use by these exercises, the site may be used by
     AFSOC units for advanced training.
         4.10.3.3.1. Observation Tower. The observation tower is located immediately east of
         the MOUT site and is a five story high building with observation decks on the second
         and fourth floors. The observation tower will not be used as a live fire target and is
         primarily used for calls-for-fire (CFF) training on the urban JCAS site and A-77
         proper. Ground units will not conduct breach operations in the observation tower.
         Ground forces training in the observation tower or MOUT site are authorized to use
         simulated munitions (Simunition FX and short range training ammunition, ultimate
         training munitions, and weapons effects training simulators) at these facilities.
         Ground units are responsible for any damage they cause to these training sites and
         must report any damage, either induced or discovered, to AFSOC/A3AR. Remove
         any materials brought to the training sites, such as blank ammo, spent casings, meals,
         trash, etc. When ground training evolutions are complete, units will close all doors
48                                 HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


     and windows in the facilities to prevent damage from the elements, and will restore
     supplied furnishings to original positions. Small arms live fire operations are
     authorized from the observation tower to A-77 proper only and not the urban JCAS
     impact area.
     4.10.3.3.2. Urban JCAS Impact Area. This site is constructed of sealand containers
     to simulate an urban canyon environment. Users of this impact area must request
     approval by HQ AFSOC/A3AR at AFSOC.A3AR@hurlburt.af.mil, 884-
     3291/8538, and schedule it through 1 SOG/OGO, 884-2871. When authorized to use
     the Urban JCAS impact area, 1 SOG/OGO will indicate "IU/JCAS" on the daily
     range schedule. Ground units will at no time conduct ground maneuvers or vehicle
     operations in the impact area, and must remain west of the 100 meter gate located on
     range road 710 during all ground movements.
        4.10.3.3.2.1. When conducting operations on the urban JCAS impact area, A-77
        and the urban JCAS impact area will be cleared by all available sensors prior to
        any live fires. If using A-77 only, aircrews do not need to clear the urban JCAS
        impact area.
        4.10.3.3.2.2. Prior to using the urban JCAS impact area, weapons will be
        tweaked. To preserve the usefulness of the JCAS impact area for as long as
        possible, aircrews will make every effort to limit collateral damage to the
        buildings in the area. Ammunition types are limited to 25MM PGU-23 (TP),
        40MM PGU-9 (HEI), and 105MM PGU-43/B (TP) due to the 300 meter distance
        from the calls-for-fire tower to the urban JCAS impact area. Aircrews will use
        peacetime training restrictions and no-fire headings as required. Units live firing
        on the JCAS impact area will annotate the following information on the Form 40,
        (alternatively, data may be faxed to A3AR at 884-4027 or emailed to
        AFSOC.A3AR@hurlburt.af.mil).
            4.10.3.3.2.2.1. Number of rounds and type expended and on which target (see
            Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6), i.e. ―TT-29‖.
            4.10.3.3.2.2.2. Any duds, type of dud munitions and its location, i.e. 10
            meters north of TT-18.
            4.10.3.3.2.2.3. Any significant damage to intermodal containers.
        4.10.3.3.2.3. For all non-Emerald Warrior missions, use the following AC-130
        weapons profiles; 25MM TP, use target TT-35 only, for 40MM HEI, all targets
        (TT‐ 20 THROUGH TT‐ 35), For 105MM TP, TT‐ 35 and TT‐ 33. The AC-
        130U radar is not authorized on the urban JCAS impact area. Complete EW
        weapons profiles for the site can be found in the Eglin A77.S025 land range
        profile, available at group and squadron current operations.
        4.10.3.3.2.4. The AC-130U radar is not authorized for live fire missions on the
        urban JCAS impact area.
     4.10.3.3.3. MOUT site. Live fire operations are not authorized in this area. Joint
     operations with aircraft and ground forces in this area will consist of dry fire
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                       49


         operations only (See Figure 4.7). Ground forces will not conduct breach operations
         unless coordinated with 1 SOSS/OSJ.
         4.10.3.3.4. Improved HLZ. The HLZ can accommodate two CV-22 aircraft and
         aircraft will land in the center of the paved cement areas. The HLZ survey with
         specific dimensions can be found on the 1 SOG/OGK CoP (Community of Practice)
         website (See Figure 4.7).
             4.10.3.3.4.1. Vertical-lift aircraft live fire operations (ground, hovering, or
             strafing) are not authorized on or over the HLZ. Joint operations with aircraft and
             ground forces in this area will consist of dry fire operations only.
      4.10.3.4. OSJ has placed two new target sets on A-77; these targets are comprised of
      three vehicles each, located southeast of the bunker. (See Figure 4.8)
      4.10.3.5. An Urban Concrete Target Array (UCTA) has been built due south of TT-15.
      The UCTA includes a simulated urban street with 3 man sized steel targets, a simulated
      IED painted yellow and a vehicle. All targets are cleared to be fired upon with 40MM
      rounds and below. 105MM rounds are not authorized on these targets. (See Figure 4.9)
         4.10.3.5.1. An area designated for 40MM APT rounds has been compiled just
         southwest of the UCTA. This target set is comprised of older tanks/APC’s pushed
         into a large pile with the intent of providing adequate sensor returns. 105MM rounds
         are not authorized on these targets.

  4.10.4. A-78. No rounds will impact within 300 meters of the observation tower at any time.
  When a ground party is on Range A-78, they will remain at or behind the observation tower
  during AC-130 initial tweak. No-fire headings WILL be used when required.
  4.10.5. A-77/A-78 IMC Operations. The following conditions and procedures will apply
  during IMC live fire operations on A-77/A-78 using the AN/APQ-180 strike radar as the
  primary sensor. DO NOT fire off an INS as the primary sensor in IMC.
     4.10.5.1. CONDITIONS: IMC live fires will be conducted only when a qualified ground
     party mans the range. The ground party will be responsible for visually clearing the
     impact area. Use TRN, FXD, SEMI, direct or offset modes. PIPP will be used for the
     tweak and periodically to check system accuracy. The 25 MM may be fired with the
     radar provided the RDR/25MM tweak was live fire checked in VMC. The GPS will be
     in the solution with an INS. Valid RDR/INS calibration values will be in the system for
     the INS being used by the RADAR (normally INS 1).
     4.10.5.2. PROCEDURES: Perform SNSR/SNSR calibrations as required, and perform
     slaving checks of the radar to the INS. Confirm position over the range by independent
     means, i.e. TACAN, VOR/DME (not GPS/INS). Aircraft will not commence live fire
     operations until authorized by the ROCC. Once the ground party has visually cleared the
     range and has passed the status to the ROCC, the ROCC will clear the AC-130U hot.
     The ground party will then direct AC-130U live fires as required. Radio contact with the
     ground party and Eglin Mission must be maintained at all times. If radio contact is lost
     with either the ground party or Eglin Mission, CEASE-FIRE until radio contact is re-
     established. If Eglin Mission is not active (when Jacksonville Center controls the
     airspace), IMC firing is not authorized.
  4.10.6. B-7. VMC only. Crews will not do calls for fire or live fire missions with actual
  ground parties. If aircraft are taking off or landing on runway 18 or 36 on B-12 (Auxiliary
  Field 7), there is no simultaneous use of B-7 and B-12, or B-75. Simultaneous aircraft use of
  Field 6 or A-77 with B-7 requires at least 1,000 feet altitude separation and a common Eglin
  mission frequency. Live fire operations on B-7 with air land/airdrop missions on Field 6 are
  authorized. If an aircraft operating on Field 6 has an emergency and needs to transit the
  airspace near B-7, it should call on guard frequency (243.0) ―RANGE B-7 CEASE FIRE‖
  and ensure exterior lights are on. There are no restrictions for simultaneous aircraft use of B-
  7 and A-78. Prior to operating on B-7, call WOLFCALL to see if there are ground parties on
  B-75 and verify they remain east of Gate 87F/75Q, B-75 Center Line range road RR704
  (16REU 18864 81009). If B-75 ground live-fire is active, aircraft will not fly lower than
  4,000 feet AGL.
     4.10.6.1. The 14 WPS, in coordination with Eglin range control, has placed controlled
     targets on impact area B-7. These targets are on the range for the sole purpose of
     modeling various AC-130 weapons effects in a controlled environment. These targets are
     located in the northeast corner of B-7 and are designated TT-3 (see Figure 4.10).
     Aircrews are restricted from shooting these targets without the approval of the 14 WPS.
     Additionally, aircrews will ensure that no weapons effects fall within the designated area.

Figure 4.10. B-7 Target Restriction.




   4.10.7. C-52N. Initial clearance to fire on C-52N must be received from range control
   (DARKIN) and is valid only as long as the gunship remains on C-52N. Coordinate specific
   targets to be fired upon through DARKIN. Gunships are authorized to fire 25MM, 40MM,
   or 105MM on targets 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 12a and 23, 31. Firing on multiple targets is authorized,
   once cleared by DARKIN. AC-130 aircraft will not fire M732/M732A1/M732A2/FMU-160
   ―prox‖ fuzed 105MM ammunition on range C-52N for training.
      4.10.7.1. C-52N IMC Operations. The following conditions and procedures will apply
      when shooting IMC on C-52N with the AN/APQ-180 radar. Do not fire off the INS in
      IMC conditions.
          4.10.7.1.1. CONDITIONS: Use TRN, FXD or SEMI modes only, no offsets. PIPP
          will be used for the tweak and periodically to check system accuracy. The 25 MM
          may be fired with the radar provided the RDR/25MM tweak was live fire checked in
          VMC. The GPS will be in the solution with an INS. Valid RDR/INS calibration
          values will be in the system for the INS being used by the radar (normally INS 1).
          Use of Target 8 (Cat’s Eye) is recommended because it is the orbit center for round
          jettison.
          4.10.7.1.2. PROCEDURES: Perform SNSR/SNSR calibrations as required, and
          perform slaving checks of the radar to the INS. Confirm position over the range by
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                        55


          independent means, i.e. TACAN, VOR/DME (not GPS/INS). Notify range controller
          (DARKIN) that the aircraft will be conducting the live-fire ―in‖ or ―through‖ the
          weather. Aircraft will not commence live-fire operations until authorized by the on-
          site range controller. If Eglin Mission is not active (when Jacksonville Center
          controls the airspace), IMC firing is not authorized.
   4.10.8. Range A-77, A-78, and B-7 de-confliction procedures. Check the range schedule
   prior to departure to see if aircraft will be on the other range during your range time.
      4.10.8.1. When advised by (ERCF) that an aircraft is en-route to another range, cease fire
      until the other aircraft calls ―Established in orbit over range __.‖ Note: Crews may
      continue firing if they determine the inbound aircraft is above their altitude or the other
      aircraft’s routing will keep them well clear of firing orbit.
      4.10.8.2. If entering a range with an AC-130 in another range, establish contact with the
      other aircraft as soon as possible and notify them when in orbit over the range.
      4.10.8.3. For simultaneous use of Ranges A-77 and A-78, the following criteria must be
      met in order to ensure safety: 1,000 feet minimum vertical separation, radio contact
      between aircraft, and (for two AC-130’s) nominal turn radius less than 7,300 feet to
      prevent overlapping orbits.
4.11. Simultaneous AC-130 and Vertical-lift Aircraft Live Fire.
   4.11.1. For simultaneous live fire operations a face to-face aircrew and/or planner brief will
   be conducted to de-conflict routes of flight and target selection.
   4.11.2. Gunships will not operate lower than 6,000 feet AGL when working with helicopters
   firing 30 mm, .50 cal, or 2.75‖ rockets (Based on a 5,000 feet AGL danger area and a
   minimum of 1,000 feet altitude separation from the highest known trajectory). When
   working with helicopters using 7.62 mm only, gunships will not operate lower than 4,000
   feet AGL due to the3,000 feet AGL danger area.
4.12. Range Clearing Procedures.
   4.12.1. These VMC procedures are for A77, A78, and B-7. The intent of range clearing is
   safety. These procedures should be applied away from home station as well, if host range
   instructions permit. The FCO will inform the pilot that the range is clear prior to the pilot
   calling for guns on the line.
      4.12.1.1. Use all available sensors. At least one visual sensor must be used for both
      initial range and continual impact area clearing (i.e. the pilot and the radar do not
      constitute ―all available sensors‖). If a visual sensor is degraded and cannot shoot but
      still has a stable picture capable of range clearing, then the APQ 180 or APQ-150 may be
      used for firing.
      4.12.1.2. If ground parties are present on A-77 and they are not located at the bunker, the
      aircrew will ensure that the ground parties have turned off the alignment point beacon
      prior to commencing live fire operations.
   4.12.2. Buddy Clearing. (Gunship only). The purpose of buddy clearing is to increase
   training realism by immediate roll-in shooting as well as saving time between range
   transitions. When away from the Eglin ranges, host range controllers must approve these
 56                                        HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


   procedures prior to use. All other established range procedures must be followed in addition
   to the following.
       4.12.2.1. The initial gunship (GS1) will clear the range using normal procedures. The
       relieving gunship (GS2) will contact Eglin Mission prior to entering the restricted area.
       Prior to range entry, GS2 will contact GS1 to ensure they are cold.
          4.12.2.1.1. After coordination with Eglin mission and GS1, GS2 will roll-in over the
          range at least 1,000 feet below GS1. Prior to firing, GS2 will contact GS1 for
          confirmation that the range is clear.
          4.12.2.1.2. GS1 will respond with the following format: call-signs, range status,
          ground party/air asset status, and weapon status. For example, ―Spooky 42 this is
          Spooky 45, A77 is clear, there are no ground parties or other air assets, and we are
          cold.‖ Note. If GS2 is only taking over the scheduled range (i.e. not doing a ―roll-in‖
          drill with a TOT), then GS2 can roll-in either 1,000 feet above or below GS1. GS1
          need not go cold if GS2 if entering above. All other restrictions still apply.
       4.12.2.2. GS2 will get clearance from the ground party (if one is present) prior to firing.
       Positive identification of the ground party’s location, by GS2, is required prior to firing.
       When doing simultaneous live fires with other flying assets, GS2 will positively identify
       and be in radio contact with all other aircraft prior to firing. Restrictions in paragraph
       4.10 apply.
       4.12.2.3. GS1 will remain overhead the range until GS2 is established. Unless this
       positive transfer of range control is accomplished, buddy clearing procedures cannot be
       used.
       4.12.2.4. If GS2 is radar only, buddy clearing may be used with additional restrictions.
       GS1 must remain overhead for GS2’s entire live fire. The target to be used will be
       coordinated prior to firing, for example, ―Spooky 41, Spooky 42 will be firing on the tail
       of the nine.‖ Constant radio contact will be maintained between gunships, preferably on
       Gunship common. Cease fire if radio contact is lost.
4.13. Eglin Dry Fire Ranges.
   4.13.1. The three Eglin dry-fire ranges are Yellow River, Rock Hill, and Wagner Field.
4.14. Vertical-lift Aircraft Operations.
   4.14.1. General. These procedures apply to 1 SOG assigned and visiting unit vertical-lift
   aircraft ops.
   4.14.2. Transit to and from the range complex must be accomplished with Eglin range
   control. Contact Eglin mission 5 minutes prior to entering the range complex. On initial
   contact relay: position, intended range, and mission number. When departing Hurlburt
   directly to a range, pass information to Hurlburt tower for coordination.
   4.14.3. A-77. No firing at targets within 25m of the bunker or at targets within 100m of the
   Close Quarters Battle Site. The 7.62 mm has an unrestricted firing fan. The .50 Cal firing
   fan is 250 to 030 degrees from the east and 070 to 210 degrees from the west. Low level
   flight profiles 100 feet AGL and lower over the center circle are not authorized due to
   unexploded ordnances.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            57


  4.14.4. A-78. No firing at targets within 100m of the tower. The 7.62 mm has an
  unrestricted firing fan. The .50 Cal firing fan is 250 to 320 degrees clockwise. Low level
  flight profiles 100 feet AGL and lower over the center circle are not authorized due to
  unexploded ordnances.
  4.14.5. C-52N. Initial clearance to fire on C-52N must be received from range control
  (DARKIN). Clear the range and notify DARKIN the range is clear before firing. The 7.62
  mm has an unrestricted firing fan. The .50 Cal firing fan is 070 to 120 degrees clockwise and
  240 to 280 degrees clockwise (or as directed by DARKIN).
  4.14.6. W-151. Contact Eglin Mission before entering airspace. Clear the impact area of
  surface vessels by 5NM and continue to clear while firing. Do not fire weapons straight
  down due to ricochets. Maintain a minimum of 100 feet above water height at all times. NO
  FIRING ON SHORELINE RANGES. Ensure you are aware of all area boundaries for each
  range area.
  4.14.7. If a fire starts during the live fire and does not burn itself out or is spreading rapidly,
  contact Jackson Guard through Eglin Mission for fire suppression.

           GENERAL LOW LEVEL/LATN/AIR REFUELING OPERATIONS

5.1. General Low Level Route Procedures.
   5.1.1. All pilots and navigators will check FLIP, section AP/1B, to be aware of high/low
   speed low level routes that conflict with their proposed low level routes. IR/VR/SR routes
   that cross any planned low level are areas with a significantly higher potential for midair
   collisions. Aircrews will ensure that these areas where IR/VR/SR and 1 SOG low level
   routes cross any planned low level route of flight are annotated on a low level chart for de-
   confliction purposes. The unpublished LR101C route (formerly SR101C) used by the 8 SOS
   and Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) route used by the 9 SOS are available on the
   1 SOG/OGV intranet site. Changes to standard 1 SOG unpublished routes (8 SOS LR101C
   and 9 SOS LATN route) will be forwarded by the respective squadron to 1 SOG/OGV for
   posting.
      5.1.1.1. Noise Abatement. To minimize aircraft noise in the surrounding communities,
      all pilots operating aircraft out of Hurlburt, Duke, Eglin AFB, or on AAC ranges shall use
      the following procedures consistent with aircraft configuration, MAJCOM directives,
      aircraft technical orders, flying safety, and mission requirements:
      5.1.1.2. Mandatory minimum altitudes for noise abatement are depicted in Figure 5.1
      and FLIP AP/1B. These altitudes shall be observed by fixed wing aircraft in all cases
      except takeoffs and landings. Fixed-wing aircraft flying LATN or SR routes should vary
      their course line within the published corridor. Vertical-lift aircraft will avoid populated
      areas to the maximum extent possible. Requests for waivers to these minimum altitudes
      should be submitted to the 1 SOG/OGO. Note: Noise abatement altitudes are not
      depicted for the areas west of Hurlburt. All 1 SOW aircrews will adhere to a minimum
      500 feet AGL altitude when over-flying or transiting the residential areas lying either
      south or west of the Eglin reservation.

Figure 5.1. Noise Abatement Minimum Altitudes.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                          59


      5.1.1.3. 1 SOW vertical-lift aircraft operating within the East-West corridor (Navarre
      Bridge to Phillips Inlet, N30-16 W085-59) should transit over water, south of Santa Rosa
      Island. Low-level flight is permitted if aircraft is at least 0.25 mile off-shore. If a delay
      is experienced entering the restricted area or while awaiting ATC clearance, do not orbit
      over housing areas. Operations over built up areas outside of the East-West corridor, to
      include Panama City, Holley-Navarre, Fort Walton Beach and Destin will be conducted
      at or above 500 feet AGL.
      5.1.1.4. Avoid all low level noise sensitive areas published in the current FCIS and FCIF.
      Flying units are directed to download and use Falconview noise abatement draw files
      made available by 1 SOG/OGV on the Hurlburt Intranet. Notification of newly published
      noise abatement areas and draw files will be via FCIF. Aircraft flying low over noise
      sensitive areas have caused concern at the FAA and HQ AFSOC. Aircrews should be
      especially diligent in avoiding built up areas by the altitudes specified in AFI 11-202, V3,
      Fixed-Wing and Vertical-Lift Operations.
      5.1.1.5. Upon request the 1 SOG/OGO will send Falconview noise abatement draw files
      electronically to non-1 SOW units that are scheduled to fly low level routes defined in
      this instruction.
5.2. Specific Route Procedures.
   5.2.1. These procedures apply to fixed wing aircraft flying routes defined in this instruction.
      5.2.1.1. IAW AFH 11-203V1, Weather for Aircrews, when winds exceed 25 knots across
      a ridge line or a mountain top, a high potential for significant mountain wave turbulence
      exists. When this condition is present, crews should avoid flying on the downwind side
      of the ridges and peaks. They should also avoid terrain masking flight which places the
      aircraft in narrow canyons and valleys where turbulence can be enhanced by the venturi
      effect.
   5.2.2. If moderate turbulence is encountered during low level operations climb to higher
   altitude/SCP/detent at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
   5.2.3. If moderate turbulence is encountered during low level operations in which in flight
   airdrop rigging is required, climb to a higher altitude for the safety of the loadmasters
   involved.
   5.2.4. Low level operations will not be flown in areas of known or forecast severe
   turbulence. Crews will cease low level operations when altitude winds exceed 40 knots in
   mountainous terrain.
   5.2.5. If turbulence is expected, have the thunderstorm penetration airspeed posted on the
   TOLD card for ready reference.
5.3. Non-published Routes.
   5.3.1. A non-published minimum use low level route will not be flown by fixed wing aircraft
   prior to the route being drawn on a 1:500,000 or larger scale chart, and being checked against
   current chart updating manual (CHUM). All low level routes will be flown at 500 feet AGL
   or higher until a survey is conducted. Perform survey flights at minimum VMC altitude
   during daylight conditions. One crewmember should devote their full attention to visually
 60                                      HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


   identifying obstacles, chart errors, and noise/game/populace avoidance areas. Surveys will
   be re-accomplished at a minimum every 6 months.
   5.3.2. Route will avoid controlled airfields by 5 NM.
   5.3.3. Route will avoid high-density traffic areas to the maximum extent possible.
   5.3.4. Vertical-lift aircraft will normally use a low-level area as defined in Attachment 6
   and the HFI 11-201 draw file published on the OGV Community of Practice (CoP)
   (https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-SO-18)
   for local low-level training. This area will be surveyed IAW MDS specific Volume 3
   requirements.
5.4. Basic Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area Procedures.
   5.4.1. The 1 SOW LATN area is an environmentally assessed, flying area for low level
   operations. Documentation is located in 1 SOG/OGO. Boundaries of the LATN area and no
   fly areas are defined in Attachment 6. Random low level training routes are authorized but
   must follow restrictions in paragraph 5.3
      5.4.1.1. Aircrews will check FLIP, section AP/1B, for nuclear power plants inside the
      LATN area and avoid them by 5 NM.
   5.4.2. The aircrew will interface with 1 SOG/OGO to obtain information of scheduled traffic
   for flights in the LATN area (e.g. LR101C/SR119).
   5.4.3. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC). The following terminology is used for rapid
   communications to disseminate bird activity and implement unit operational procedures:
   BWC "LOW": Activities less than severe or moderate and appear to be of limited threat.
   BWC "MODERATE": 10 - 19 small birds (pigeon, dove, sparrow), or 5 - 9 large birds
   (herons, geese, ducks) within 1000 feet of runway centerline or within proximity to
   approach/departure path. BWC "SEVERE": 20 + small birds (pigeon, dove, sparrow), or 10
   + large birds (herons, geese, ducks) loitering within runway hold lines (250 feet on either
   side of runway centerline) or within same proximity to final approach/departure path. The
   Bird Watch condition will be relayed to all inbound aircraft and broadcast on ATIS.
      5.4.3.1. Declaration authority for the BWC at Hurlburt Field is the Chief, Airfield
      Management or designated representatives.        All aircrew should conduct low
      level/LATN/range area bird analysis during preflight duties via USAHAS and BAM.
      Personnel should be alert for bird activity and report such activity to Airfield
      Management or 1 SOW/CP. These reports may include recommendations for an
      upgraded BWC.
      5.4.3.2. BASH Phase I and II Guidance. The following direction is provided to all
      aircrew based upon the BWC, time of year and location. Phase II is defined as the time
      period between 15 Sep through 15 Nov for fall migration and 1 Mar to 30 Apr for spring
      migration. Phase I is all other times of the year. Phase II in the spring will be declared
      by exception based on bird strike data, numbers of incidents, and bird activity.
      5.4.3.3. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC) Operations (ALL PHASES).
          5.4.3.3.1. Airfield: LOW - Normal operations, no significant bird activity.
          MODERATE - Declaration of BWC "Moderate" requires initial take-offs and full
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                        61


         stop landings only. No touch and go landings. Full stop taxi-back, for purposes of
         onload/offloading personnel, is authorized. Restricted low approaches must be at or
         above 500 AGL. Exception: Vertical-lift aircraft operations (hoist, fast rope and
         other low speed operations) below 1000 feet is authorized to conduct required
         training. Aircraft commanders will be particularly aware of bird activity when on
         final and will go around or alter their flight profile when birds are observed on final
         or in close proximity of the runway. The tower watch supervisor may consider
         changing runways during BWC "Moderate." SEVERE - Declaration of BWC
         "Severe" requires 1SOG/CC approval to continue flying operations (take-offs and
         landings). 1 SOG/CC authorization is not required for IFEs if the aircraft commander
         deems an immediate landing for full stop is warranted. The tower watch supervisor
         may consider changing runways during BWC "Severe." 1 SOG/CC will consider
         delaying departures/arrivals and aircraft diverts.
         5.4.3.3.2. Low Level/Range/LATN: LOW - Normal operations, no significant bird
         activity. MODERATE - Aircraft commanders will make appropriate changes in
         mission profile to minimize hazard. Changes should include avoidance of known
         and/or observed bird concentrations, raising flight altitude (recommended at or about
         1000 feet) and reducing airspeed (less than or equal to 200 knots). If birds are struck,
         change profile or altitude to avoid additional strikes and report on Common
         Frequency/FSS/1 SOW Command Post/SOF. SEVERE - Avoid all severe areas or
         overfly at 2000 AGL minimum.
     5.4.3.4. Phase II Mitigation Operations - This section specifically addresses operations to
     be implemented during Phase II times of year. Phase II corresponds with Fall and Spring
     bird migration patterns. Fall Phase II is September 15 - November 15. Spring Phase II is
     March 1 - April 30. Historic data shows only a small increase in strikes therefore Spring
     Phase II will be declared by exception by 1 SOW/CC based on recommendation from 1
     SOW/SE. The below mitigation operations are to be implemented during all times of
     Phase II.
         5.4.3.4.1. BWC "Moderate" and associated procedures will be declared within +/-one
         hour of sunrise/sunset.
         5.4.3.4.2. Airfield Phase II Mitigation Operations - Within +/- one hour of
         dawn/dusk, only initial take-offs and only full stop landings, restricted low
         approaches must be at or above 500 feet AGL Exception: Vertical-lift aircraft
         operations (hoist, fast rope and other low speed operations) below 1000 feet is
         authorized to conduct required training.
         5.4.3.4.3. Low Level/Range/LATN Phase II Mitigation Operations- Within +/- one
         hour of dawn/dusk, avoid flight below 1000 feet. Aircraft are to avoid large inland
         bodies of water or overfly at 2000 feet AGL.
  5.4.4. Aircrews will incorporate Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) and the BWC into their
  briefings. Crews can check the Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) website at
  http://www.usahas.com. This site has specific bird data on 1 SOW low-level routes,
  military and civil airfields, Eglin Range bird conditions, as well as links to the Bird
  Avoidance Model (BAM). Historical data shows most bird strikes occur below 1,500 feet
  AGL. Crews should consider climbing to this altitude, (or higher) when flying in the vicinity
 62                                       HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


   of lakes, rivers, or when a large number of birds are seen. Specific guidance for BWC
   SEVERE, MODERATE, and LOW can be found in Appendix 1 to Annex C of the 1 SOW
   BASH plan.
5.5. LATN Restrictions.
   5.5.1. Flights are approved at normal low level altitudes.
   5.5.2. LATN missions will not be flown through Class B, C, or D airspace. Uncontrolled
   airports will be avoided by 3 NM when possible. LATN missions will not fly within 3 NM
   of prohibited airspace unless approved by the airspace controlling agency.
   5.5.3. Aircrews using the LATN area will comply with AFI 11-202 v3, AFI 13-201, and
   route criteria in FAA Handbook 7610.4., Air Traffic Plans and Publications, paragraph 1400.
5.6. Traffic De-confliction and Radio Procedures.
   5.6.1. Position reports will be made IAW this supplement (Attachment 3, Attachment 4,
   Attachment 5) and FLIP AP/1B.
      5.6.1.1. Prior to flight, a crewmember will review the daily range schedule and brief their
      crew of other aircraft operating in the LATN area with profiles/call signs.
   5.6.2. In-flight, all aircraft will maintain a listening watch on FSS (255.4/122.2). While in
   the low-level structure, all aircraft will make a position report at the mandatory reporting
   points identified on the 1 SOG LATN Area Route Overlay shown in Attachment 3,
   Attachment 4, & Attachment 5. The format for the position report is outlined in
   paragraph 5.6.4
      5.6.2.1. 1 SOG vertical-lift aircraft should maintain radio communications with
      appropriate controlling agency (ERCF, Eglin Tower or Duke Tower), if possible, when
      performing landing or approaches at other than controlled airports. Position and status
      shall be reported every 30 minutes to make sure assistance can be requested, if necessary.
      5.6.2.2. When operating in multi-ship elements, relay all deviations from planned flight
      plan to the Air Mission Commander (AMC). The AMC will relay this information to
      aircraft which present a potential conflict. If unable to contact the AMC, ensure line of
      sight (LOS) communication is established with other known traffic.
      5.6.2.3. When operating single ship (in either the local training area or on off station
      multi aircraft exercises), relay all deviations from planned flight on Flight Service Station
      (FSS) (primary) and fixed wing/vertical-lift aircraft (secondary). In addition, advise the
      Command and Control element.
      5.6.2.4. If all aircraft are unable to monitor FSS when operating low level in formation,
      the formation lead will assign one member of the formation/element (as appropriate) to
      monitor FSS. The formation lead is responsible for relaying information to the FSS
      monitor if a mission frequency will be unmonitored.
   5.6.3. A crewmember will react to position reports received by comparing points/ETAs with
   the area route overlay for potential conflicts. A conflict exists when ETAs are within 30
   seconds of each other. Aircraft will be de-conflicted by a minimum of 500 feet.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         63


      5.6.3.1. Mid-Air Collision Avoidance, Vicinity of United States Navy Outlying Fields
      (OLF). 1 SOG vertical-lift aircraft will tune 121.95 VHF (Navy helicopter common)
      prior to flight in or below the Eglin west MOA or in the vicinity of any non-tower
      controlled USN OLFs. 1 SOG vertical-lift aircraft will make ―UNICOM‖ type traffic
      calls stating position, altitude, and intentions. Non-tower controlled OLFs will normally
      be avoided by 1 NM. Periodic calls will be made as the aircraft approaches and departs
      OLF areas and East Bay/Yellow River areas. Review the coordinates of OLF Santa
      Rosa, Holley and Harold and insure proper radio terminology is used when making de-
      confliction calls. Contact with Choctaw Tower (380.80) is mandatory when working LZs
      below their airspace. Maximum mid-air avoidance vigilance will be used in this
      congested area. If flight within 1 mile of the following non-tower OLFs is required,
      contact their fire department crash crews for traffic information: OLF Harold 237.9(0800-
      1700), OLF Santa Rosa 361.1(0800-2330). Be aware that low level helicopter training
      takes place surface to 500 feet along the Yellow River and over East Bay.
      5.6.3.2. Mid-Air Collision Avoidance, Vicinity of Central Corridor Landing Zones: 1
      SOG vertical-lift aircraft will tune to Primary UHF frequency listed in Table 2.1
      (vertical-lift aircraft common) during flights transitioning through or operating in central
      corridor landing zones. 1 SOG vertical-lift aircraft will make a ―UNICOM‖ type traffic
      calls stating position, altitude, and intentions. Periodic calls will be made as aircraft
      approach and depart landing zones and upon entering or exiting the central corridor.
      Contact with Duke Tower is mandatory when working landing zones within their
      airspace. Maximum mid-air avoidance vigilance will be used in this congested area.
   5.6.4. The following format will be used when making position reports on low level routes:
      5.6.4.1. Position and time.
      5.6.4.2. Name of low level route.
      5.6.4.3. Direction of flight.
      5.6.4.4. Name and ETA of next turn-point.
5.7. Air Refueling (AR) Procedures.
   5.7.1. The aircraft commander will ensure that the tanker crew or tanker home unit is
   notified if the 1 SOW aircraft is delayed or aborts the mission. Notification can be made
   directly by DSN or through the WOC.
      5.7.1.1. Normally, refueling altitude will be limited to 12,000 feet MSL or below.
   5.7.2. When possible, AR training aircraft will not be configured with excessive drag
   sources.
   5.7.3. Tanker aircraft require specific formation details to include: the position of each
   aircraft in the cell (tanker and receiver), type rendezvous, post refueling procedures, and AR
   cell breakup procedures.
   5.7.4. During training, if the plan changes, it must be coordinated and acknowledged by all
   participants.
   5.7.5. Destin and Pensacola Air Refueling (AR) Tracks. The Destin Refueling Tracks A, B,
   C, and D are approved for in-flight operations from 3,000 feet to 13,000 feet MSL and

  diagrams are listed in Attachment 2. Standard block altitudes are 3,000 ft to 6,000 ft and
  9,000 ft to 13,000 ft MSL. These are not FLIP published AR tracks; therefore, tanker aircraft
  may require particulars on track points, altitudes, and airspeeds prior to the refueling mission.
  5.7.6. Destin anchors are available only to units scheduled through the 46 Test Wing/DOR
  on an AAC test directive. The squadron will request use of Destin anchors through 1
  SOG/OGO. If the entire 3,000 to 13,000 feet altitude block is not required, request only the
  airspace needed. This may preclude a cancellation due to higher priority AAC missions.
  5.7.7. AR302 or alternate Destin tracks may be available should the requested Destin track
  be preempted by AAC missions. All Destin refueling tracks are located in Warning Area 151
  (W151) and under radar control by Eglin Mission. The servicing Air Route Traffic Control
  Center (ARTCC) is Jacksonville Center. Destin A is located in W151 A & C. Destin B is
  located in W151 B & D. Destin C is located in W151C & D. Destin D is located in W151 A
  & C.
  5.7.8. Anchor coordinates and frequencies are depicted in Attachment 2. Altimeter settings
  broadcasted by Eglin Mission Control will be used for refueling on Destin AR tracks.
  Pensacola A AR Track is located in W155 A & B and is controlled by ―Seabreeze‖ on 313.2
  or 118.95. The controller can be contacted prior to flight at DSN 922-2735.
  5.7.9. A new IFR/TAR Track in the vicinity of Rucker AAF can be used by AFSOC C-130s,
  CV-22, and support tanker aircraft only. This track is for back-up use when other refueling
  tracks (W-151) are unavailable. It will be primarily scheduled for evening/night time use.

                                              Chapter 6

                          EMERGENCY/SAFETY PROCEDURES

6.1. Aircraft Emergencies.
   6.1.1. Specific guidance for every eventuality during an emergency cannot be provided.
   However, no aircraft shall be allowed to land or taxi onto the runway, or be cleared for
   takeoff after an inbound emergency aircraft to that runway is within 5 flying miles for slow
   moving aircraft.
       6.1.1.1. When an emergency is declared (time permitting), provide ATC the following
       information:
       6.1.1.2. Call sign (identification).
       6.1.1.3. Type aircraft and position.
       6.1.1.4. Nature of emergency.
       6.1.1.5. Number of personnel on board.
       6.1.1.6. Fuel in time remaining.
       6.1.1.7. Intentions (for example, approach end engagement, stop boulevard traffic, etc.).
       6.1.1.8. Ordnance type and number.
6.2. Hot Brakes.
   6.2.1. Aircraft having hot brakes after landing or aborting takeoff will notify the tower of hot
   brakes and parking intentions. Refer to HFI 13-201 for particular parking locations on
   Hurlburt; however, if landing at Eglin or Duke park on the following taxiways if possible.
       6.2.1.1. Eglin AFB (Figure 1.1).
       6.2.1.2. Runway 19: Taxiway G, south side.
       6.2.1.3. Runway 01: Taxiway O, northeast side.
       6.2.1.4. Runway 01: Taxiway P, northeast side
       6.2.1.5. Runway 12: Taxiway G, south side.
       6.2.1.6. Runway 30: Taxiway D, north side.
   6.2.2. Duke Field (Figure 1.2).
       6.2.2.1. Runway 18: Taxiway E.
       6.2.2.2. Runway 36: Taxiway B.
6.3. Lightning Restrictions.
   6.3.1. The Operational Weather Station (OWS) will issue a "Lightning Watch" 30 minutes
   prior to thunderstorms being within a 5 NM radius of the center of the runway. The Base
   Weather Station (BWS) will issue a "Lightning Warning" whenever lightning is occurring
   within 5 NM radius of the center of the runway. Upon receiving a "Thunderstorms within 10
   NM observed advisory" or a "Lightning Watch" in-progress activities may continue;
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                        69


   however, all personnel must prepare to terminate activities immediately in the event of a
   "Lightning Warning." When lightning is occurring within 5 NM, the BWS will issue a
   "Lightning Warning." Cease all outside/flight line activities and personnel will seek shelter.
   Unless an immediate takeoff is a safer course of action, aircraft ready for taxi or taxing
   aircraft will return to parking. These procedures also apply if lightning is observed within
   the immediate vicinity without an official lightning warning from the BWS. (IAW HFI 91-
   203, Thunderstorm & Lightning Response).
      6.3.1.1. Munitions loading will not be initiated unless it can be completed before
      lightning will become a hazard. If munitions loading has begun and lightning becomes a
      hazard, the crew will cease loading and depart the flight line/hot cargo. Ensure the WOC
      notifies security police that there will be an unattended aircraft with munitions, unless
      immediate takeoff is a safer course of action, any taxiing aircraft with munitions aboard
      will return to hot cargo if lightning is declared within 5 NM.
   6.3.2. Aircraft taxiing to parking or hot cargo when lightning is declared within 5 NM
   should not expect a marshaller. The aircrew will hold in place or proceed to parking if
   clearance is assured. Seek shelter or remain in the aircraft if safer. Time permitting,
   coordinate with Base Operations (PTD frequency) if the aircraft will be parked in any
   location other than one assigned by the Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC)
   through the WOC.
6.4. Aircraft Abandonment.
   6.4.1. To preclude the possibility of aircraft crashing into a populated area in the Eglin
   complex after abandonment, the following procedures shall be used when an aircraft can be
   flown and abandoned under controlled conditions:
      6.4.1.1. Notify applicable control agencies of intentions to abandon aircraft.
   6.4.2. Bailout over land or water ranges.
   6.4.3. Aircraft commanders may bailout crew members at any suitable pre-designated area
   prior to initiating the procedures outlined in this paragraph.
   6.4.4. The ERCF shall radar-monitor the operation to the extent possible, and furnish the
   probable impact point of aircraft and crew members to Base Operations.
   6.4.5. The areas shown in Figure 6.1 should be used if possible when bailing out from an
   aircraft in the traffic pattern. These areas avoid populated areas.

Figure 6.1. Emergency Jettison/Bailout Areas.




6.5. MC-130 Refueling Hose Jettison Procedures.
   6.5.1. MC-130 aircraft with a hung refueling hose shall jettison over the following ranges:
   SONTAY DZ (R2915A CEW 218/12), PINO DZ (R2914A CEW 120/17), any range not
   active, or Eglin water range.
      6.5.1.1. If a hose fails to cut, avoid populated areas and advise Eglin Approach Control if
      a road should be closed for the approach; make an approach to one of the following:
      6.5.1.2. Eglin: Runway 01, Runway 12, or Runway 30.
      6.5.1.3. Duke Field: Runway 18 or 36.
      6.5.1.4. Hurlburt Field: Runway 18 only.
6.6. Round Jettison Procedures for AC-130 Aircraft.
   6.6.1. Round jettison will be over the range in use or any other suitable land range. If in
   IMC, use the Eglin Offshore Salvo area (DWG 190/50) (EXCEPTION: AC-130U on an
   IMC live fire profile). In an emergency, jettison the round over an uninhabited area, note the
   location, and notify Eglin Mission Control and 1 SOW WOC (following procedures for an
   off range expenditure).
      6.6.1.1. All jettisoned rounds will be reported to Munitions Flight in order to correctly
      account for the munitions.
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                            71


  6.6.2. On water ranges, the normal firing orbit/altitude may be used for round jettison.
  Ensure the surface is clear of vessels by at least 5 NM.
  6.6.3. A-77 & A-78 Round Jettison Procedures with Ground Parties. Round jettison
  procedures will not be performed until all ground parties have departed the impact and
  ricochet areas. On A-78 the ground party will depart the range to the southeast, until the
  jettison is complete.
  6.6.4. A-77, A78, and C-52N IMC Round Jettison Procedures. Round jettison and hot gun
  will be IAW VMC procedures. However, you need not gain VMC to jettison a round. For a
  Hot Gun, If unable to gain VMC by Hurlburt VFR Traffic Pattern altitude in A-77, A-78 or
  2,500 feet MSL in C-52N, request radar vectors to remain clear of populated areas.
  6.6.5. AC-130U Only. The aircraft commander will direct when the FCO selects FXD,
  resets nominals, shifts orbit center, and selects a non-wind corrected guidance. Orbit the
  center of the range and attempt to keep the gun pointing in the center of the impact area until
  level at jettison altitude. The FCO should keep updating the nominals as the aircraft
  descends to give the Pilot useful geometry. Normally, the gun should remain trainable and
  slaved during descent to maximize chances of an inadvertent discharge impacting the center
  of the range. Once level, transition to the round jettison point for the applicable range, and
  when directed, the FCO will select a non-wind corrected orbit, select FXD on the respective
  gun and then clear the gunners to select manual for the 40MM gun. Keep the nominals set
  for firing altitude and orbit centered on the center of the impact area until the aircraft is level
  at 3,000 feet AGL and the aircraft commander directs the changing of nominals and orbit
  center. This ensures a valid and visible CIP on the HUD. Rounds will be jettisoned through
  the round jettison port. The TSM should also be used for position awareness with range
  corners displayed. The gunner jettisoning the round will state ―ROUND AWAY‖ on CALL.
  6.6.6. A-77: Fly an orbit around the southeast corner of the range at 3,000 feet AGL, 158
  KTAS, and 35 degrees of bank. The gunners will complete their emergency procedures up
  to, but not including, extracting the round. Once the gunner is ready to extract the round, the
  navigator will begin a descending 40-second countdown (in 5-second increments) when the
  aircraft heading passes 065 degrees. The intent is to jettison the round at the end of the 40-
  second countdown (aircraft heading should be 235 degrees, jettison should occur between
  270 and 200 degrees). The gunner jettisoning the round will call ―ROUND AWAY‖ and the
  navigator will mark the aircraft/round position. If the round cannot be extracted within 15
  seconds past the end of the countdown, continue the orbit and attempt once more before
  recovering with a hot gun. At no time will an extracted round be retained in the aircraft for
  another orbit. The IR Operator should track the jettisoned round until impact and target store
  the impact point.
  6.6.7. A-78. Fly an orbit around the southwest corner of the range at 3,000 feet AGL, 158
  KTAS, and 35 degrees of bank. The gunners will complete their emergency procedures up
  to, but not including, extracting the round. Once the gunner is ready to extract the round, the
  navigator will begin a descending 40-second countdown (in 5-second increments) when the
  aircraft heading passes 155 degrees. The intent is to jettison the round at the end of the 40-
  second countdown (aircraft heading should be 325 degrees, jettison should occur between
  360 and 290 degrees). The gunner jettisoning the round will call ―ROUND AWAY‖ and the
  navigator will mark the aircraft/round position. If the round cannot be extracted within 15
 72                                       HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


   seconds past the end of the countdown, continue the orbit and attempt once more before
   recovering with a hot gun. At no time will an extracted round be retained in the aircraft for
   another orbit. The IR Operator should track the jettisoned round until impact and target store
   the impact point.
   6.6.8. B-7. Before performing a round jettison on B-7, use at least one visual sensor to
   ensure the western half of B-75 is clear of personnel and they remain east of Gate 87F/75Q,
   Center Line Range Road RR704 (16REU 18864 81009) and verified by WOLFCALL.
   Aircraft will not descend below 4,000 feet AGL before all B-75 live fire operations have
   ceased. Fly an orbit around the northeast corner of the range at 3,000 feet AGL, 158 KTAS,
   and 30 degrees of bank. The gunners will complete their emergency procedures up to, but
   not including, extracting the round. Once the gunner is ready to extract the round, the
   navigator will begin a descending 40-second countdown (in 5-second increments) when the
   aircraft heading passes 200 degrees. The intent is to jettison the round at the end of the 40-
   second countdown (aircraft heading should be 040 degrees, jettison should occur between
   070 and 010 degrees). The gunner jettisoning the round will call ―ROUND AWAY‖ and the
   navigator will mark the aircraft/round position. If the round cannot be extracted within 15
   seconds past the end of the countdown, continue the orbit and attempt once more before
   recovering with a hot gun. At no time will an extracted round be retained in the aircraft for
   another orbit. The IR Operator should track the jettisoned round until impact and target store
   the impact point.
   6.6.9. C-52N. Fly an orbit around target 8 at 3,000 feet AGL, 158 KTAS, and 35 degrees of
   bank. The gunners will complete their emergency procedures up to, but not including,
   extracting the round. Once the gunner is ready to extract the round, the navigator will begin
   a descending 40-second countdown (in 5-second increments) when the aircraft heading
   passes 290 degrees. The intent is to jettison the round at the end of the 40-second countdown
   (aircraft heading should be 100 degrees, jettison should occur between 135 and 065 degrees).
   The gunner jettisoning the round will call ―ROUND AWAY‖ and the navigator will mark the
   aircraft/round position. If the round cannot be extracted within 15 seconds past the end of
   the countdown, continue the orbit and attempt once more before recovering with a hot gun.
   At no time will an extracted round be retained in the aircraft for another orbit. The IR
   Operator should track the jettisoned round until impact and target store the impact point.
6.7. Hot Gun/Jammed Gun Procedures (AC-130 only).
   6.7.1. These procedures will be used any time a gun contains a round that cannot be removed
   in flight.
   6.7.2. Hot Gun. If any probability for an inadvertent firing exists, in the opinion of the lead
   gun, the live fire will be terminated and the following procedures will be used:
      6.7.2.1. Notify Mission Control and 1 SOW WOC of the hot gun condition and declare
      an emergency. Request the WOC initiate hot gun checklist.
      6.7.2.2. Return to Hurlburt using the hot gun routes (Attachment 12) and avoid bringing
      the guns to bear on any populated areas.
      6.7.2.3. Descend to traffic pattern altitude prior to leaving the range. If recovering from
      range C52N, depart the range at 2,500 feet MSL and maintain this altitude until passing
      Brooks Bridge before descending to traffic pattern altitude.

   6.7.3. IFR Hot Gun Recovery Routes:
      6.7.3.1. Eglin AFB. Expect radar vectors to avoid populated areas to the maximum
      extent possible. Expect clearance for standard recoveries: Runway 01/30, Eglin North
      Recovery, and Runway 12/19, DDUNE Recovery.
      6.7.3.2. Hurlburt Field. Approaches shall be under radar control except during lost
      communications conditions. A turn will be made to avoid populated areas as soon as
      visual contact with the runway environment is made.
      6.7.3.3. Duke Field. Instrument approaches are available to both runways. ILS Runway
      18 is an emergency use only approach.
      6.7.3.4. Hot gun parking will be IAW HFI 13-201. Caution should be used as there is
      insufficient lighting in this area. Aircrew withdrawal distance is 400 feet.
   6.7.4. Jammed Gun (to include 25MM ASHS/Conveyer). (AC-130 only) If the lead gun
   determines that there is no probability of an inadvertent firing, the following guidelines
   apply:
      6.7.4.1. The aircraft commander may elect to continue the live fire. Dry fires are not
      authorized.
      6.7.4.2. The aircrew may execute a normal recovery to a full stop at Hurlburt Field.
      Aircraft will be parked at hot gun parking IAW HFI 13-201. Multiple approaches are not
      authorized until the malfunction has been cleared.
      6.7.4.3. Off-station/out and back aircraft are authorized to return to Hurlburt Field at the
      completion of their live fire mission. Do not depart an airfield without the approval of
      the squadron commander or operations officer.
      6.7.4.4. Notify 1 SOW WOC and request they initiate jammed gun checklist. Request
      the WOC notify maintenance and EOD to meet the aircraft.
      6.7.4.5. A 105MM round-case separation is not a hot gun situation. The projectile may
      remain in the barrel with the breach closed. If no attempt was made to fire the round, the
      brass case may be returned to the ammunition rack. Otherwise it will be treated as a
      failure to fire and the case jettisoned. When returning with the projectile in the barrel,
      use the applicable hot gun route to avoid over-flight of populated areas. No touch and go
      landings are permitted and the aircraft must be returned to hot gun parking. Request the
      WOC notify maintenance and EOD to meet the aircraft and request they initiate jammed
      gun checklist.
6.8. Transition with Munitions/Expendables.
   6.8.1. Transition training with munitions on board is authorized at pre-designated locations.
   Chaff and flares are classified as munitions. All munitions must be stored in fixed munitions
   bins/racks/dispensers (marks may be floor loaded). Airfields authorized for unrestricted
   transition training with munitions are Hurlburt Field, Duke Field, Eglin AFB and Tyndall
   AFB. Other airfields may be temporarily designated by 1 SOG/CC or COMAFSOF after
   coordination with the airfield manager. If required to park with munitions on board, meet the
   following separation distances. These separation distances are the minimum required
   between explosives loaded aircraft and any inhabited building, civilian aircraft or

   Incident will be grounded until the 1 SOW Firing Incident Review Panel (FIRP) convenes
   and concludes its investigation or unless released by 1 SOG/CC or 1 SOG/CD. Non-1 SOW
   crews will be prohibited from participating in tactical operations within the Eglin Air Force
   Base Reservation until the FIRP concludes its investigation unless released by the 1 SOG/CC
   or 1 SOG/CD. The FIRP will convene at 1300 in the 1 SOG conference room the next duty
   day following the incident at home station. If the incident occurs away from home station,
   the crew will not be allowed to participate in tactical operations until the 1 SOG/CC or 1
   SOG/CD, or designated mission commander reviews the circumstances surrounding the
   incident. Crews will meet the FIRP within five days after returning to home station.
6.10. Hung Flare Procedures.
   6.10.1. A hung flare is defined as an attempted launch of a flare resulting in the flare
   protruding from the dispenser. Crews will notify Tower upon discovery of a hung flare and
   taxi to the appropriate hot cargo/de-arm area. Tower will notify Crash-Fire-Rescue,
   Weapons maintenance, and EOD to coordinate de-arming of the aircraft.
      6.10.1.1. Flares that simply do not fire are to be considered misfires and not ―hung
      flares.‖ In case of a flare misfire, follow normal recovery procedures to parking, annotate
      the misfires in aircraft 781 forms, and debrief maintenance.
6.11. Use of Nylon Garments.

6.12. Aircrew Toxicological Testing.
   6.12.1. IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigation and Reports Military Members. Ensure
   toxicology testing is immediately considered following a mishap, if deemed necessary. For
   all classes and categories of mishaps, commanders have the discretion to test involved
   military members whose actions or inactions, in their judgment, may have been factors in the
   mishap sequence. However, for all Class A and B aviation mishaps, commanders must test
   all military crewmembers on the flight orders. Because the evidence is perishable,
   commanders should test all military crewmembers on the flight orders for aviation mishaps
   that have the potential of meeting the Class B threshold.
6.13. Bird Strike Policy.
   6.13.1. Bird strikes will be written up in the 781 and reported to the wing/ squadron safety
   offices via the 1 SOW Bird Strike Report. An aircraft experiencing a bird strike will land
   and be inspected as soon as practical.

   the Eglin complex for missions involving EA, whether or not the unit launches and/or
   recovers at Eglin.
   7.2.3. All aircraft conducting EA are required to monitor 243.0 or 121.5 MHz, Guard
   channel and stop employment operations upon hearing a ―CEASE BUZZER‖ call.
   7.2.4. After ―CEASE BUZZER‖ has been given and the aircraft has ceased EA, then
   Frequency Control Analysis will try to determine when and what part of the EA can be
   resumed. If the frequency band causing the problem cannot be separated or the frequency
   bands cannot be determined, then the EA is to remain off until the safety issue or emergency
   has been cleared and Frequency Control Analysis has given the approval to resume.
   7.2.5. Flight leaders, individual pilots, or Electronic Warfare Officers (EWO) will include
   applicable portions of this instruction in in-flight briefings.
   7.2.6. Each unit will provide 1 SOG/OGO the name/phone numbers of its operations officer
   to contact for interference resolution.
7.3. Authorized EA Systems.
   7.3.1. Chaff and Flare Systems (e.g. ALE-40/47).
   7.3.2. EA Transmitters: (e.g. ALQ-131/172/196, AAQ-24).
   7.3.3. All 1 SOW operational systems are authorized for use.
7.4. Scheduling.
   7.4.1. All missions planning to employ flares will be scheduled as a hot mission.
   7.4.2. EA should be requested as delete-able items, if appropriate, to preclude missions
   being nonscheduled for conflicts in this area.
   7.4.3. Missions desiring to use EA will require inclusion of the appropriate Radio Frequency
   Authorizations (RFA) line numbers on the mission request form. EA will be rescheduled on
   a mission-to-mission basis, regardless of the working area.

      altitude restrictions for flare employment.
   7.5.3. Eglin Flare Procedures.
      7.5.3.1. Missions into the Eglin complex are subject to restrictions listed in EAFBI 11-
      201 and Eglin Range profiles.
      7.5.3.2. Flights must be specifically scheduled for flares and received clearance from
      Eglin Mission Control prior to dispensing. Flares may be employed over government
      land only. Flares will not be expended over populated areas, personnel, or structures.
      Minimum release altitude over authorized test areas is 200 feet AGL, and 500 feet AGL
      when not over authorized test areas.
      7.5.3.3. To minimize false alarms and unnecessary generation of search and rescue
      sorties, 1 SOW aircrews will contact Destin Coast Guard station at 244-7147 when
      dropping flares over water in the local area. Contact the station prior to flight, or in flight
      through the WOC, and pass call sign, approximate time flares will be dispensed, and
      approximate location (miles off shore) flares will be dispensed.
      7.5.3.4. Further restrictions may be imposed by AAC Range Safety and Test Wing
      central test area scheduling authority (46 OSS/OSCS) when required.

      Control.
      7.6.1.5. Eglin Mission Control may require a test dispersal to determine wind effect.
      7.6.1.6. Wind conditions and complexity of air traffic may make it necessary for Eglin
      Mission Control to disapprove/terminate chaff dispersal.
      7.6.1.7. Chaff will normally (depending upon mission requirements) be authorized
      within W151C/D (min of 20 NM off shore in all W151) provided the flight is scheduled
      for the airspace from the surface up to the employment altitude.
      7.6.1.8. Flight lead or single ship will ensure that chaff is not employed under any
      conditions that would cause it to drift outside of the scheduled working area, particularly
      to the south where it could interfere with the Gulf Route.
      7.6.1.9. Operations within the warning areas will be under flight lead control and limited
      by exception only.
      7.6.1.10. Chaff usage within W151A/B and S3/S5/S6/S7 must be specifically scheduled.

      7.6.2.3. No chaff is permitted in the north/south or east/west VFR corridors.
      7.6.2.4. In all other areas of Eglin restricted airspace, chaff is limited to 2,000 feet and
      below.
      7.6.2.5. Wind conditions and traffic complexity may make it necessary for ATC to
      disapprove the chaff drop. The final authority must rest with Eglin Mission Control.
7.7. Electronic Warfare (EW) Employment Procedures.
   7.7.1. Electronic Attack (EA) training in the United States and Canada will be conducted
   IAW CJCSM 3212.02B, Enclosure C, and all applicable directives (specific range
   procedures, local area restrictions, etc). If EA is suspected as the source of radio frequency
   interference, the nearest ATC facility or the Eglin Frequency Control and Analysis (FCA)
   office can stop and put on hold any EA in emergency situations by transmitting on guard the
   unclassified brevity coded words ―CEASE BUZZER.‖ This should also be followed by
   contacting the FCA immediately if ATC is the issuing authority. EA training outside the
   United States and Canada will comply with all host nation/state agreements and applicable
   directives.
      7.7.1.1. Radio discipline and OPSEC will be maintained during all forms of EA training
      to prevent disclosure of classified information.

   down.
   7.9.3. Hung flares will be treated according to the procedures found in paragraph 6.10
7.10. Airborne Laser Operations.
   7.10.1. In order to minimize the safety hazard and maximize the opportunity for effective
   testing/training, the procedures outlined in the following paragraphs will be used when
   employing an airborne laser designation system. The Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance for
   all lasers will be adhered to at all times.
       7.10.1.1. Gunship Laser Target Designator/Rangers (LTD/R and LTD/RF) may be used
       for test or training missions on the Eglin reservation. Gunships do not normally use run-
       in headings; they may use their designator throughout the entire orbit. Ranges for
       designator use are A-77, A-78, B-7, and C-52N (C-72, during test only).
       7.10.1.2. Aircrews will use standard J-Laser terminology during laser operations and will
       advise the ground party prior to designating any target.
       7.10.1.3. For any delivery where the target will be directly lazed, the aircrew will not
       activate the laser until the target has been positively identified, an unrestricted line-of-
       sight exists, and a steady track on the target is assured. The aircrew should cease lazing
       after weapon release for unguided munitions, after weapon impact for guided weapons, or
       if the laser drifts towards the edge of the clear area.
       7.10.1.4. Gunship. Illuminators/Pointers and the Infrared Zoom Laser Illuminator/
       Designator may be used in all operating areas (Live/Dry fire areas).

      8.3.5.17. Copy of each squadron’s list of qualified FCF/OCF crewmembers.
8.4. Squadron Commander Responsibilities.
   8.4.1. Select the most qualified crewmembers to perform FCF duties. Applicable crew
   positions requiring qualification will be trained IAW MDS-specific Volume 1 guidance. In
   the absence of a formal FCF training course, training will consist of ground requisites to
   include all items on the Command-approved AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record,
   and a minimum of one sortie. (EXCEPTION: sortie may be completed in a simulator if
   flights are not available or practical). Aircrew qualifications may be waived on a case-by-
   case basis IAW Command Directives. Previously FCF-qualified aircrew members are
   exempt from this requirement.
   8.4.2. Assign FCF training duties to highly qualified crewmembers ensuring compliance
   with AF Form 4109, Special Operations Aircrew Training Record.
8.5. Local FCF/OCF Procedures.
   8.5.1. Local FCF operating area as defined in paragraph 1.8.1
   8.5.2. FCF/OCF Procedures. OCF flights will be performed similar to FCF flights, in
   accordance with the requirements of this section. While OCFs do not require detailed
   briefings, the aircrew must be briefed before the flight, by the most qualified technician
   available, on the status of the aircraft, checks to be accomplished, and the profile necessary to
   accomplish the OCF.
   8.5.3. Weather minimums.
      8.5.3.1. FCFs: Day VMC IAW T.O. 1-1-300, paragraph 6 (vertical-lift aircraft 500-feet
      ceiling and 2 SM visibility or 700-feet ceiling and 1 SM visibility), day only. FCF hover
      checks require only 300-ft ceiling / ½ SM visibility (day or night).
      8.5.3.2. OCFs: IAW MDS-specific Vol. 3 operating procedures, T.O. 1-1-300, paragraph
      6, and local directives. Vertical-lift aircraft 500-feet ceiling and 2 SM visibility or 700-
      feet ceiling and 1 SM visibility day only. Vertical-lift aircraft nighttime OCF 500-feet
HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                        83


      ceiling and 2 SM visibility, and for the 8 SOS, squadron CC, DO, or ADO approval is
      required.
      8.5.3.3. The Operations Group (or equivalent) commander to which the aircraft is
      assigned (for transient aircraft, the wing or equivalent commander at the transient base)
      may waive weather minimums (ref. T.O. 1-1-300, paragraph 6.2).
   8.5.4. Radio/Radar Control Procedures. Aircrew will remain under positive ATC control at
   all times. Aircrews should use radar advisory service to the maximum extent possible. This
   will ensure maximum aircrew concentration on aircraft control and procedures.
   8.5.5. Aircrew FCF/OCF Procedures:
   8.5.6. Conduct FCF/OCF briefing with maintenance and quality assurance personnel. All
   aircrew will be aware of the condition requiring the FCF/OCF and the profile to be flown.
   8.5.7. In conjunction with maintenance, develop an FCF/OCF profile that will accomplish
   all pertinent ground and flight events in a safe and efficient manner.
   8.5.8. Only the minimum necessary aircrew and maintenance personnel will fly during
   FCF/OCF. Passengers not directly involved with the FCF/OCF will not be allowed to fly.
   8.5.9. Conduct FCFs IAW T.O. 1-1-300, MDS-specific-6CF-1, MDS-specific-6CL-1 and
   squadron specific procedures.
   8.5.10. Conduct a debriefing with maintenance personnel. Ensure all FCF/OCF events are
   completed to the maximum extent possible.
   8.5.11. Emergency Procedures.
   8.5.12. Emergency Recovery Base. The departure airfield is the primary emergency
   recovery base. As the situation dictates, aircrew may use any suitable airfield/landing area
   available as a recovery base.
   8.5.13. Bailout/Fuel Jettison. Adhere to HFI 13-201 for locations and procedures.
8.6. Radio/Radar Considerations.
   8.6.1. Aircrew must use the most positive control measures available for flight following.
   Radio contact should be maintained with either Air Traffic Control (ATC) or Special
   Operations Command and Control Element (SOCCE) as appropriate. If radar coverage is not
   available, aircrew will provide to the mission commander/SOCCE a description of operating
   area and profile before flight.
   8.6.2. Aircrew Procedures. Follow the guidance found in this instruction. Deployed
   operations normally require greater vigilance on the part of the aircrew to ensure safety. Use
   all information available before conducting FCF/OCF.

               W-151 RANGE CLEARING AND LIVE FIRE PROCEDURES

Note: All AFSOC crews utilizing the Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range (EGTTR) for live fire
operations will carry a copy of the Incidental Harassment Authorization (IHA) and will comply
with all operating restrictions directed therein. Eglin Overwater Live Fire Operations AFSOC
message incorporates the IHA and is located on the AFSOC CoP under the ACTIVE FCIF
folder.
Note: All aircrews must complete marine mammal observation training before utilizing the
EGTTR.
Contact 4 SOS/DOT at DSN: 579-6126 or Comm: (850) 884-6126 to receive training.
A16.1. If daytime weather and/or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance for
detecting marine mammals and other marine life, air-to-surface live fires must be delayed until
adequate sea conditions exist for aerial surveillance to be undertaken. As a minimum for live
fire operations; in flight visibility will be 3nm or greater, ceiling of 1,000 feet or greater and
weather must be sufficient to maintain a 5nm clearance around the target area. Additionally,
daytime live fire will be conducted only when sea surface conditions do not exceed Beaufort sea
state 4 (i.e., wind speed 13-18 mph (11-16 knots); wave height 1 m (3.3 ft)).
A16.2. Crews will locate a suitable firing site immediately after exiting U.S territorial waters
(12nm).
A16.3. Prior to each firing event, the crew will conduct a visual and/or instrument survey of the
5nm wide prospective target area to locate any marine mammals that may be present.
   A16.3.1. As a minimum, the crew will fly two complete orbits around the prospective target
   area at a maximum altitude of 6,000 feet.
A16.3.2. Ensure a 40 meter radius area is clear of protected species and indicators before live
fire begins. A 20 meter radius is sufficient for night live fires or when only using 40mm or less.
   A16.3.3. If marine mammals are not detected, the crew can continue to orbit and climb to
   the firing altitude.
   A16.3.4. During low altitude orbits and climb to firing altitude, the crew will visually scan
   the sea surface within the target area for the presence of marine mammals. The crew will
   utilize all available visual scanners and operable sensors to the maximum extent possible.
   A16.3.5. If any marine life is detected, either during initial clearance or after commencement
   of live fire, the mission will be immediately terminated, suspended, or relocated until the
   marine mammals has left the area. If the crew relocates to a different area or live fire is
   paused for more than 10 minutes, steps A29.3.1. thru A29.3.4. will be repeated.
A16.4. If no marine life is detected, operations may begin by launching MK-25 flares into the
target area. Live fire may commence utilizing the smallest round having the least impact and
proceeding to larger rounds. During night operations, AC-130’s will use 105mm TP
ammunition, 105mm HE is not authorized.
A16.5. After live fire operations; utilizing all available visual scanners and operable sensors, the
crew will scan the target area for any injured or dead marine mammals. The crew will initiate a
 118                                     HURLBURTFIELDI11-201 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


spiraling descent to an observation altitude of 6,000 feet. Rates of descent will occur over a
three to five minute time frame.
A16.6. After landing, the crew will complete and fax Protected Species Observer Report Form
to the SOF. If any dead or injured marine life is observed prior to firing or injured and killed
during live fire operations, a Protected Species Observer Report Form must filed with the
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) by the following business day. Any unauthorized
impacts on marine life must be immediately reported to the NMFS representative and to the
respective Stranding Network representative.
