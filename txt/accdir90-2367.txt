This directory implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-2, Inspector General--The

Addendum J, Unit Compliance Inspections, and ACC Instruction (ACCI) 90-202, ACC
Compliance and Standardization Requirements List (C&SRL) Program. It is used to evaluate
unit compliance with public law, executive orders, Department of Defense and Air Force
directives. This directory supports guidance contained in AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Management, Combat Air Force (CAF) Supplemental guidance and associated Air
Force instructions and technical orders (T.O.s) regarding Logistics Maintenance Flight
operations. This directory applies to all ACC units and Air National Guard (ANG)/Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) Associate units with Logistics Maintenance Flight responsibilities.
It applies to non-associate, ACC-Gained ANG units when an equivalent National Guard Bureau
(NGB)-approved and published ANG C&SRL does not exist. It does not apply to AFRC units
which are not an associate program. Maintain records created as a result of the prescribed
processes identified in this directory in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of
Records, and dispose of them IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) found on the
Air Force Portal link. Contact supporting records managers as required. Send comments and
suggested improvements to this directory on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Compliance items
and individual references have been updated to reflect policies, guidance and procedures
governing Logistics Maintenance Flight operations IAW new AFI 21-101 and CAF Supplement.
1. General.
    1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists are the primary lists used during
    HQ ACC/IG Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI) to access unit compliance with guidance
    governing each particular area of operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the HQ
    ACC and, as applicable ANG and AFRC (for associate units only), staffs and based upon
    existing “by-law” requirements, Executive Orders, DoD directives, AF and ACC guidance,
    and mission areas deemed critical by AF, ACC and/or ANG leadership to assessing and
    assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to
    identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection
    items and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs)
    and the missions areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core
    and General Compliance Items may be stand-alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the
    UCI, it is the intent of the evaluation team to inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that
    apply to the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the
    inspection. Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An area or item where unit failure to
       comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or
       serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
Airman development programs
Ability to deploy forces
Ability to employ forces
CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance
       and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical."
       Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could
       result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to
       successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal
       impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible
       litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.

Associate Unit— For purposes of this publication, an associate unit is defined as where the ACC
(active Duty component) unit retains principal responsibility for weapon system or systems,
which it shares with one or more reserve component units.
Compliance and Standardization Requirements List (C&SRL)—A comprehensive list of
items drawn from numerous directives that help determine unit compliance with public law,
executive orders, Department of Defense, and Air Force directives.
Core Compliance Item (CCI).—An item or area that requires special vigilance and is important

Critical Compliance Objective (CCO).—An area or item where unit failure to comply with
established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or
significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
Airman development programs
Ability to deploy forces
Ability to employ forces
General Compliance Item (GCI).—An item or area deemed fundamental to successful overall
performance of the unit, but non -compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation
Maintenance Information Systems (MIS)—MIS refers to the automated maintenance
information systems including Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS), Reliability and
Maintainability Information System (REMIS), and G081 (CAMS for Mobility). MIS provides
maintenance supervisors at all levels with products to evaluate the organizational effectiveness
and to aid in the decision making process.
Special Certification Roster (SCR)—Management tool that provides supervisors a listing of
personnel authorized to perform, evaluate, and inspect critical work.
