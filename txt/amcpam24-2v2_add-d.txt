This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 2, Airbus. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 2 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by Airbus S.A.S. Corporation. Airbus was first created in 1970 as Airbus Industrie
GIE, a multi-national consortium, and is currently owned by European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Company (EADS). As of the date of this publication, Airbus S.A.S. has provided more
than 5,900 aircraft to carriers worldwide, with over 5,600 still in operation.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 2, Airbus Addenda. Volume 2 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 2 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Airbus
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 2, Airbus Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum D. Airbus A330 Series.
The aircraft in the A330 Series are wide-body, medium to long-range aircraft, and capitalize on
fuel economy with its twin engine design. Although not as numerous as the A320 Series, Airbus
has several pending orders for A330 Series aircraft, with military variants (as a Multi Role
Tanker Transport) showing up in other countries, so the fleet should be in active production for
quite some time.

The A330 Series aircraft was launched concurrently with the A340 Series and share many
characteristics in fuselage, wings, and tail design. The two series continued along the Airbus
concept of “commonality”, which it started in earlier series. The common fly-by-wire
architecture and cockpit systems, not only in different aircraft in the A330 Series, but in the
A320 and A340 Series as well, expanded upon this. The A330 and A340 series introduced cross-
crew qualification and mixed-fleet flying, in which airlines are able to switch their Airbus
aircraft and their pilot crews at short notice to better match capacity to demand.

The A330-300 was actually the first A330 to enter the market. It had its first flight in November
of 1992 and was type-certified in October of 1993. As of the date of this publication, 284 A330-
300s have been delivered, with 283 still in operation. (One was written off as a total loss, due to
toxic chemical damage of improperly prepared and shipped HAZMAT.)

The A330-200 became the second version of the series with its first flight in August of 1997 and
type-certification in March of 1998. The A330 enabled Airbus to offer airlines a slightly smaller,
scaled-down version between the A330-300 and A340-200. Currently, 367 A330-200s are in
operation.

The A330-200F is the newest addition to the series. Airbus gave the go-ahead for a freighter
version of the A330-200 around the 2007 timeframe. The A330-200F had its first flight on 5
November 2009. With almost 70 aircraft on order and the first delivery projected in early 2010, it
seemed logical to include information about it in this Addendum D.

AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 2, Addendum D will focus primarily on the:

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 2 Addendum.
