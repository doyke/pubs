This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, Environmental Quality.
The purpose of this instruction is to establish procedures for management and disposal of
hazardous material (HM) in the 507th Air Refueling Wing (ARW). It references Department of
Defense (DOD) Hazardous Material Management System (HMMS), the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Communication Standard (HCS), the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) laws and regulations and the Air Force Material Command (AFMC)
Pharmacy Concept and integrates existing policies and procedures to minimize and control the
use of HM in the work place. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication
to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force Form (AF Form) 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form’s 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at www.e-publishing.af.mil.

1. General Information: This instruction establishes procedures and assigns responsibilities
for the management and disposal of hazardous material (HM) in the 507ARW. The Unit
Environmental Coordinator (UEC) will be the program manager and the primary contact for
chemical assistance within the 507 ARW. Ground Safety (OC-ALC/SEG), Bioenvironmental
Engineering (72AMDS/SGPB) and Civil Engineering (72ABW/CEV) provide assistance by
periodically surveying the areas, evaluating procedures being used and by making
recommendations. Chemical flushing procedures will be coordinated with Environmental
Management Operations Engineering (72ABW/CEVOE). CEVOE provides assistance on

Each flight within the 507 ARW will insure compliance with this instruction within the scope of
their respective organization. This operating instruction implements for the 507 ARW the OC-
ALC-TAFB Instruction 32-7001, Hazardous Material Management Program and the Air Force
Material Command (AFMC) Pharmacy Concept.
