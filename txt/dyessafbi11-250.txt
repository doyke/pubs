1.2. Pilot, Airfield Operations Flight (P/AOF) Liaison Program. The purpose of this
program is to ensure an open forum for Dyess aircrews and AOF personnel to exchange
information and feedback regarding services provided by Dyess Tower and AMOPS. The
AOF/CC is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this program. The AOF/CC may
designate a P/AOF Program Manager in writing. This manager ensures at least one air traffic
control and one airfield management representative attends every 7 BW and 317 AG quarterly
safety meeting. These representatives, however, are NOT at liberty to establish new procedures
or polices. NOTE: 7 BW/SEF and 317 AG/SEF will notify the AOF/CC of upcoming Fly Safe
meetings.
1.3. Mid-Air Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program. The purpose of this program is to
highlight the potential for mid-air collisions in the local flying environment and to provide
aircrews’ advice and tips on how to avoid them. 7 BW/SEF is the OPR for this program IAW
AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. Specific actions for Dyess AFB are
found in AFI 91-202, DYESSAFBSUP, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
NOTE: 7 BW/SEF will advise the AOF/CC of all scheduled visits to local airports so
ATC/AMOPS representatives may attend. 7 BW/SEF will also report each visit to airports,
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                9


Fixed-Base Operators (FBOs) and/or flying schools at the AOB. 7 BW/SEF will notify the
AOF/CC when upcoming quarterly safety meetings are scheduled so that AOF representatives
may attend.
1.4. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. The purpose of the BASH program is to
minimize the bird/wildlife strike hazard to aircraft and to clarify wing bird strike inspection and
reporting procedures. 7 BW/SE is the OPR for this program. BASH procedures and bird watch
conditions are located in DYESSAFB OPLAN 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
Program.
1.5. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Program. The purpose of the FOD program is to enhance
safety of Air Force personnel and equipment by removal of foreign objects through education,
prevention measures and control techniques. 7 BW/CVF is the OPR for this program and
conducts procedures IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
NOTE: For monthly Wing FOD walks, the aerodrome (runway, landing zones, airspace etc.)
will be closed by a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).
1.6. Airfield Driving Program (ADP). The purpose of the Airfield Driving Program (ADP) is
to control vehicle and pedestrian operations on the airfield. The Deputy Airfield Manager
(DAFM) is the OPR for this program. Airfield driving procedures are derived from AFI 13-213,
Airfield Driving. This regulation discusses the responsibilities of AMOPS, airfield agency and
unit commander for controlling vehicle and pedestrian operations on the airfield.
1.7. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Program. The purpose of the SOF program is to maintain a
safe and efficient terminal airspace environment. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level
position and is the direct representative of the 7 OG/CC. Decision authority is delegated to this
position to accomplish the mission since the SOF is the focal point for coordinating flight
operations and maximizing efficient flying operations. The SOF communicates with the B-1
aircrews during flying operations and C-130 aircrews when on-duty during 317 AG flying
operations. The SOF will coordinate requests and traffic pattern priorities with the Dyess Tower
Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller (WS/SC), but not the line controllers. 7 OG/OGV is the
OPR for this program. The SOF Program will be conducted IAW AFI 11-418, Operations
Supervision and any incorporating changes.
1.8. Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Program. The purpose of the Air
Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) program is to promote the public health and safety
through the local adoption of compatible land use controls and to protect the operational
capability of the air installation. 7th Civil Engineering Squadron (7 CES) is the OPR for this
program. 7 CES conducts studies for noise, accident potential zones, clear zones and safety
IAW AFI 32-7063, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Program.
1.9. Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) Program. The purpose of the TERPS
program is to provide safe terminal procedures for aircraft operating to and from military and
civil airports. The main considerations include criteria for obstacle clearance, descent/climb
gradients and landing minimums. HQ ACC/A3AOT is the OPR for this program. TERPS-
related concerns may be reported to the AOF/CC. The AOF/CC and/or Dyess Tower’s TERPS
liaison will funnel the concern to HQ ACC/A3AOT for coordination.

safety and also evaluate the services provided by Safety, 7th Operations Support Airspace
Management (7 OSS/OSR) and 7 CES. 7 OSS/OSA is the overall OPR for this program. In
ACC, these inspections are conducted every 36 months. These inspections identify negative
trends and assure corrective action is taken IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 2, Airfield Operations
Standardization and Evaluations.
1.11. Annual Airfield Certification/Safety Inspection (ACSI). An annual inspection is
completed by the AFM, 7 CES and 7 BW/SE and 317 AG/SE to determine the airfield’s
condition as required by USAF infrastructures and safety requirements. The AFM is the OPR
for the annual inspections. The 7 OG/CC, 7 MSG/CC, AFM, 7 CES, 7 BW/SE and 317 AG/SE
shall review and coordinate on the annual inspection staff package prior to 7 BW/CC’s
endorsement IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 2. Results will be briefed at the AOB.
1.12. Quarterly Joint Airfield Inspection. AFM, DAFM, AOF/CC, 7 BW/SE (flight and
ground safety) 317 AG/SEF, SOF Program Manager, 7 CES (waivers/pavements) and 7th
Security Forces Squadron (7 SFS) representatives may conduct quarterly airfield inspections.
The AFM is the OPR for these inspections.
1.13. Local Operating Procedures (LOPs). 7 OSS/OSA is responsible for ensuring LOPs are
developed which define procedures and responsibilities for services provided by the AOF. LOPs
are also maintained between the 7 OSS and several on/off-base agencies to ensure proper
coordination for activities impacting the airfield and/or ATC facility.
   1.13.1. The following documents are examples of LOPs: Letters of Agreement (LOAs),
   Operations Letters, Operating Instructions (OIs), Operations Plans (OPLANs) and Base
   Directives or Instructions. LOPs are accessible to all AOF assigned personnel and are
   located in the AOF/CC office.
   1.13.2. Base and unit level instructions with ATC or AMOPS taskings will be coordinated
   through AOF/CC and forwarded to HQ ACC/A3AO for review/approval.
   1.13.3. Mandatory Review Process/Frequency. 7 OSS/OSA annually reviews the effective
   dates of LOPs that affect the local airfield/flight environment.
   1.13.4. 7 OSS/OSR will maintain and review airspace LOAs and Certificates of
   Authorization file locations annually or when appropriate IAW AFI 13-201, Airspace
   Management, ACC Sup 1. These LOAs are located in the 7 OSS/OSR’s office IAW AFI 11-
   202 Vol 3, General Flight Rules, ACC Sup 1.
1.14. Protection and Release of Records. The AOF/CC is responsible for all ATC and
AMOPS records. The AOF/CC is also the custodian for all ATC recording tapes/transcripts and
will handle requests/release of information IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3. Recorded or written records
concerning mishaps will not be released to anyone without authorization from the 7 OG/CC.

                         AIRFIELD FACILITIES INFORMATION

2.1. Airfield Facilities. The Dyess Base Operations Building 9001 contains the AOF/CC’s and
AFM’s offices, AMOPS section, Flight Planning Room, Aircrew Lounge, Distinguished
Visitor’s (DV’s) Lounge (maintained by Wing Protocol), the Weather Flight (WF) and Transient
Alert (TA). Refer to the Dyess Airfield Diagram (Attachment 2) for Base Operations location
and other associated facilities.
2.2. Airfield Operating Hours. Although Dyess AFB has manning authorizations to support
24/7 hour operations IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3 ACC Sup Attachment 19, Dyess airfield hours of
operation are published in the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement. Aircrews must use the
IFR Supplement and view NOTAMs for mission planning purposes. The last arriving aircraft
must be parked with engines shutdown prior to the airfield closing time. Aircrews are
encouraged to land at least 15 minutes prior to the published airfield closing time.
   2.2.1. Reduction/Extension of Operating Hours. The 7 WG/CC is the approval authority for
   reduction or extension of operating hours IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3. The 7 WG/CC may
   authorize airfield closures that do not exceed 96 hours (4 days), including days already
   published closed (i.e., if airfield is published closed on Sat and Sun, the 7 WG/CC may
   authorize a Fri-Mon closure), to support short-notice emergency maintenance requirements
   or other short-term requirements to include goal/training days and holidays. Closures
   scheduled for more than 4 days must be approved by HQ ACC/A3AO. Upon approval
   notification, AMOPS will issue NOTAMs extending or reducing hours of operation as
   required.
   2.2.2. Outside of Published/NOTAM Hours. The 7 WG/CC is the final approval authority
   for operations outside of published/NOTAM hours and on federal holidays. Uncontrolled
   Airfield Operations (UAOs) may be accomplished if approved and executed IAW Chapter
   10.
       2.2.2.1. Requests for mission essential flight operations (i.e., National Airborne
       Operations Center (NAOC), Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM), Medical
       Evacuation (MEDEVAC) and Higher Headquarters (HHQ)-directed missions) will be
       coordinated through the AOF/CC. The AOF/CC will channel the request to the 7 OG/CC
       for approval. Upon approval from 7 OG/CC, the AOF/CC will notify Dyess
       Consolidated Command Post (CP) to inform the following organizations: Dyess Tower,
       AMOPS, WF, TA (for non-base assigned aircraft), Fire Department (FD), Ambulance
       Services (Medical), 7 SFS and base customs (if applicable).
       2.2.2.2. Inbound Aircraft. For operations approved outside of published/NOTAM hours
       (except UAO), the airfield will open 1 hour prior to the scheduled aircraft’s Estimated
       Time of Arrival (ETA). The airfield will close after the last arriving aircraft has parked
       and shutdown engines.
       2.2.2.3. Outbound Aircraft. For operations approved outside of published/NOTAM
       hours, the airfield will open 30 minutes prior to the scheduled aircraft’s Estimated Time
       of Departure (ETD). The airfield will close 1 hour after the last aircraft’s departure time
       in the event the same aircrew/aircraft needs to return to Dyess. If verbally released by the
 12                                               DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


       aircrew from this requirement, the airfield may be closed 5 minutes after the aircraft’s
       departure.
2.3. Air Traffic Control Facilities/Designation of Airspace. Abilene (ABI) Terminal Radar
Approach Control (TRACON) exercises primary control over aircraft on IFR clearances within a
35 NM radius of the ABI VORTAC up to and including 12,000’ MSL (See Attachments 6 and
7). Dyess Tower is responsible for control of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic from the surface
up to but not including 3,000’ MSL within 5 NM of the center of Dyess AFB Runway 16/34,
including 3 NM extensions on the arrival and departure ends of the runway. It also extends 5
NM from either side of the runway extended centerline (see Attachment 5). Dyess AFB
essentially controls Class Charlie (C) airspace.
   2.3.1. Dyess Tower coordinates with ABI Approach prior to aircraft leaving Dyess Tower’s
   area of responsibility. ATC procedures will be IAW Control, Coordination, and Separation

2.5. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) Procedures. The Dyess ATIS is
designed to provide aircrews with current runway in use, weather, field advisories and NOTAMs
and is operational during airfield operating hours. The ATIS message format is IAW FAA Order
(FAAO) JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control. Additional items include tower pattern restrictions and
other data pertinent to aircraft operations (i.e, crop dusting, quiet hours, tower evacuations). The
ATIS may include instrument hold line restrictions to protect the precision approach critical
areas on Taxiways Bravo and Foxtrot during inclement weather IAW FAAO JO 7110.65. Dyess
Tower will update the most current ATIS information and pass to ABI Approach.
2.6. Runway Selection Procedures. Runway 16 is the calm wind runway. Whenever the wind
speed is 5 knots or greater, the runway most nearly aligned with the wind will normally be
used. The Dyess Tower WS/SC is the designated authority for selecting the active runway for
aircraft operations. The Dyess Tower WS/SC determines the runway in use based on criteria in
FAAO JO 7110.65 and this instruction.
   2.6.1. Issuing Wind Information. Dyess Tower issues wind direction and speed from wind
   displays. When wind displays are unavailable, Dyess Tower will issue wind information
   contained in the latest weather sequence, prefaced with the term “WIND ESTIMATED.” The
   WF, however, is the authority for determining if winds should be estimated.
          2.6.1.1. Dyess Tower will select wind sensors for the approach end of runway unless an
          operational advantage will result from another setting. Dyess Tower will advise aircrew
          if reported winds are from other than the approach end of runway. This may be
          accomplished by including information on the ATIS broadcast and aircrew advise they
          have current ATIS information.
          2.6.1.2. Locally assigned aircraft will be issued variable wind information of 30 degrees
          or more and/or when the wind speed is 10 knots or more.
          2.6.1.3. Transient aircraft will be issued variable wind information for changes in wind
          direction of 60 degrees or more in the preceding 2 minutes, when the wind speed is
          greater than 6 knots IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3.
          2.6.1.4. Dyess Tower will notify the WF and ABI Approach when it is suspected that the
          wind equipment is unreliable. The WF will notify 7 CS/SCOA to establish a job. When
          the wind equipment is returned to operational status, the WF will notify Dyess
          Tower. Dyess Tower will then notify ABI Approach.
   2.6.2. Windsocks. There are three 15-knot wind socks on the airfield. East of Runway 16/34
   and south of Taxiway Bravo; East of Runway 16/34 and south of Taxiway Charlie; East of
   Runway 16/34 and north of Taxiway Foxtrot.
   2.6.3. Runway Change Procedures. Dyess Tower will coordinate with ABI Approach during
   Dyess runway change procedures. This coordination will resolve any traffic problems
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            15


   associated with the change. Upon changing the runway in use, Dyess Tower will notify ABI
   Approach, AMOPS, WF, FD, Marrion Tower (if in use) and Dyess Consolidated CP. Dyess
   Tower will broadcast the runway change on all tower and ground control frequencies.
2.7. Airfield Lighting Systems. AMOPS and Airfield Lighting (7 CES/CEOFE) are
responsible for inspecting airfield and obstruction lighting. Dyess Tower has control of the
airfield lighting panel and will operate all airfield lighting systems and visual aids IAW FAAO
JO 7110.65, AFI 13-204 Vol 3 and local Operating Instructions (OIs) for all aircraft operations.
The airfield lighting vault/primary airfield lighting panel is located in Building 4101 which is
south of the Base Operations building. Furthermore, AMOPS maintains an LOA with 7
CES/CEOFE to address outages and maintenance response times.
   2.7.1. Runway 16/34 Lighting: U.S. standard high intensity Approach Lights (ALSF-1s),
   Sequenced Flashing Lights (SFLs), Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPIs) and High
   Intensity Runway Lights (HIRLs). ALSF-1s begin 3,000’ from threshold.
   2.7.2. LZ 162/342: Contains no permanent lighting. Temporary will be placed along LZ
   162/342 prior to and during all night operations by the Operational Support Specialists
   (CCT) or Landing Zone Safety Officer (LZSO). Lighting is either Overt (White) or Covert
   (Infrared - IR) as requested by the user. LZ 162/342 also contains permanent reflective
   panels.
   2.7.3. LZ 162/342: Contains Low Intensity Runway Lights (LIRLs) that are remotely
   controlled from Marrion Tower or Dyess Tower. Infrared (IR) lighting on LZ 162/342 is
   required prior to and during NVG operations. LZ 162/342 also contains permanent reflective
   panels.
   2.7.4. Rotating Beacon. Dyess AFB’s rotating beacon is located 1 mile east of Runway
   16/34 atop the water tower. Dyess Tower solely controls the rotating beacon.
   2.7.5. Obstruction Lights. The Marrion Tower obstruction light must be operational during
   operations to the LZs at night.
   2.7.6. Drop Zone (DZ) Warning Lights. The control of the Warning Lights is at Dyess or
   Marrion Towers. The lights must be activated (ON) during all air drop and assault landing
   operations, day and night. The Operational Support Specialists (CCT) or Landing Zone
   Safety Officer (LZSO) operates the warning lights while on duty to prevent unauthorized
   personnel and vehicular crossings during drops of equipment or personnel and during all
   assault landings to LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342.
   2.7.7. UAOs. The Operations Duty Officer will assume responsibility for airfield lighting
   during UAOs IAW Chapter 10.
2.8. Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS). Dyess Tower is the
ATCALS/Navigational Aid (NAVAID) monitoring facility and reports all ATCALS
malfunctions, outages and restorations to AMOPS, 7 CS/SCOA and ABI Approach. If known, 7
CS/SCOA will provide Dyess Tower restoration estimates. Dyess Tower will pass the restoral
estimates to AMOPS and the AOF/CC.
   2.8.1. On-base NAVAIDs. Dyess AFB operates a Tactical Air Navigation Station
   (TACAN) during airfield hours. The TACAN is monitored by Dyess Tower. The TACAN
   No-NOTAM Maintenance Periods (MPs) are listed in the IFR Supplement. Dyess AFB also
 16                                              DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


   has a Category I (CAT I) Instrument Landing System (ILS). It is a dual ILS that serves
   Runway 16/34 and has an interlock feature that allows only one system to be in use at a given
   time. Localizer interlock will not be bypassed to permit simultaneous operations. Dyess
   Tower monitors the ILS facilities during airfield operation hours and removes the ILS from
   service when Dyess Tower is closed.
   2.8.2. Off-base NAVAIDs. Dyess AFB utilizes Abilene’s Very High Frequency Omni-
   directional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) Station, monitored by Fort Worth
   Center (ZFW). Dyess AFB also uses the Tuscola Very High Frequency Omni-directional
   Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) Station, monitored by ZFW.

   2.8.3. Generator Power Procedures. Both the Dyess TACAN and ILS facilities have
   generators. For monthly generator power checks, 7 CS will need approval from the AOF/CC
   for changing any facility to or from backup power and performing any maintenance on the
   inactive ILS.
   2.8.4. Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) responsibilities for 7 OSS/OSA,
   7 OSS/OSAT, 7 CS and 7 CES are supplemented in the Air Traffic Control and Landing
   Systems (ATCALS) and Mission Critical Communications Systems Operations Letter between
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 17


   7 OSS, 7 CS and 7 CES located in the AOF/CC office. This letter clarifies equipment
   restoral priorities, non-published ATCALS equipment downtime request, generator training
   for air traffic controllers, routine coordination procedures, exercises, flight check procedures,
   current and forecasted weather required prior to and during MPs and significant ATCALS
   outage reporting/response time requirements and other ATCALS operational issues. This
   information is further supplemented in the 7 CS MOI 21-204.
2.9. Protecting Approach Critical Areas. See depiction in Attachment 2.
   2.9.1. Protecting the Precision Approach Critical Areas. These areas consist of the
   glideslope critical area and the localizer critical area. Instrument hold lines are established to
   protect the glideslope critical area during inclement weather. Dyess’ instrument hold lines
   are located on Taxiways Bravo and Foxtrot. When the reported ceiling is less than 800’
   and/or visibility is less than 2 miles or the Runway Visual Range (RVR) is less than or equal
   to 2,400’, all aircraft and vehicles must stay behind the instrument hold lines to protect the
   glideslope critical area. Dyess Tower will place an IFR hold line advisory on the ATIS
   broadcast. Dyess Tower will remove this advisory once weather conditions improve. During
   inclement weather, drivers must contact Dyess Tower for access to the runway while holding
   short of the IFR hold lines. Due to the perimeter roads’ proximity to the localizer critical and
   glideslope critical areas, Dyess Tower will restrict access to those areas as required based on
   inclement weather and traffic situation.
   2.9.2. Protecting the Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). The POFZ is an 800’ X 200’
   area centered on the runway centerline, beginning at and extending outward from the runway
   threshold, designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground vehicles and
   other aircraft when the ceiling is less than 300’ or visibility is less than ¾ SM. When the
   tower instructs aircraft to hold behind the IFR hold lines during inclement weather conditions
   listed in Para 2.9.1, the POFZ is protected.
   2.9.3. Protecting the Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS). The OCS normally begins 200’
   from the landing threshold point measured along the final approach course centerline and
   extends to the final approach fix IAW AFMAN 11-226 (I). The OCS sloping surface slightly
   penetrates the northernmost hammerhead of Taxiway Bravo and the southernmost
   hammerhead of Taxiway Foxtrot. When weather drops below 800’ ceiling and 2 miles
   visibility, the OCS must be protected from aircraft (vehicles, however, are not tall enough to
   penetrate the OCS surface on the hammerheads). Dyess Tower will place an advisory on the
   ATIS that the northernmost hammerhead of Taxiway Bravo and the southernmost
   hammerhead of Taxiway Foxtrot are unavailable for taxiing purposes due to inclement
   weather. Dyess Tower will remove this advisory once weather conditions improve.

2.10. Airfield Maintenance (Sweeper Operations, Grass Mowing, Snow Removal).
   2.10.1. Sweeper Operations. CE Horizontal (7 CES/CEOHP) will provide an airfield
   sweeper during airfield operating hours and a pavement repair team to monitor pavement
   deterioration, perform required maintenance and repair activities. The sweeper shall contact
   the AMOPS counter either in person, by radio or via phone and ensure their whereabouts
   whenever departing the airfield Mon – Fri during normal flying windows. AMOPS will
   notify 7 CES to bring in the standby sweeper for any out of hours operations to include HHQ
   taskings. Airfield sweeping operations are supplemented by the LOA between AMOPS and
   7 CES/CEOHP.
   2.10.2. Grass Mowing. Grass mowing heights on the airfield are maintained IAW AFI 91-
   202. The contract for airfield mowing operations is maintained at 7 CES/CEOPP and may be
   viewed upon request by the AFM.
   2.10.3. Snow Removal. Airfield snow removal operations are performed IAW 7 BW SICP,
   Snow and Ice Control Plan.
2.11. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). Dyess AFB’s CMA consists of Runway 16/34, LZ
162/342, LZ 162/342, overruns, instrument landing system (ILS) critical areas, Marrion Drop
Zone (DZ), perimeter roads, and all other areas west of the runway hold lines. VFR hold lines,
instrument hold lines and hold signs instruct vehicles to contact tower for permission to enter the
CMA. See Attachment 2.
   2.11.1. During airfield operating hours, Dyess Tower controls all movement in the CMA.
   Vehicles/personnel must obtain permission to enter the CMA. Vehicles operating in the
   CMA must use rotating beacon lights or hazard/warning flashers. Vehicles and personnel
   must maintain two-way radio communications with tower while in the CMA. Vehicle
   operators leaving the CMA will exit then notify Dyess Tower/Ground with their current
   location. When Dyess Tower requests vehicles to exit the runway/movement area, all
   vehicles will depart immediately to an area located behind the VFR hold lines.
   2.11.2. Vehicles operating in or through the CMA must be in radio contact with Tower
   either on a Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio, Tower Net (the back-up is the Ramp Net).
   Cell phone communication with Dyess Ground (ATC) is for emergency use only. If needed,
   call must be continuous, and if connection is lost, immediately exit CMA and re-establish
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 19


   contact with tower to provide your current location and status. (Hands free communication is
   required to operate a government vehicle while talking on a cellular device).
   2.11.3. Recall of Vehicles. In the event of a radio failure or out of necessity to direct
   vehicles or personnel away from the CMA, Dyess Ground will attempt to contact the vehicle
   using light gun signals. If the vehicle does not respond, Dyess Ground will cycle the runway
   lights from the lowest to highest intensity to signal a loss of radio communication. After
   observing the runway lights cycle, personnel on the runway will attempt to contact Dyess
   Ground while immediately exiting the runway. If the above procedures fail, Dyess Ground
   will notify AMOPS for assistance. AMOPS will proceed to the airfield to escort the vehicle
   out of the CMA. NOTE: Refer to AFVA 13-222, Runway/Controlled Movement Area
   (CMA) Procedures, for additional CMA procedures.
   2.11.4. During non-airfield operating hours, the CMA is no longer active and reverts to an
   uncontrolled movement area. Vehicles/personnel, preparing to transition onto the
   runway/landing zones or towing an aircraft on the airfield must contact Dyess Consolidated
   CP (Raymond 37) prior to commencing operations and will report when exiting the area.
   These actions are accomplished in order for Dyess AFB to maintain proper oversight and
   safety of personnel and aircraft resources. NOTE: The 317 AG Operations Duty Officer
   (ODO) may activate the runway to accomplish pre-coordinated and approved UAOs IAW
   Chapter 10. Vehicles/personnel will follow base driving procedures for UAOs.
2.12. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. The Tye Ramp is unusable for
aircraft operations since it is not maintained.
2.13. Aircraft Arresting Systems. There are no aircraft arresting systems at Dyess AFB.
2.14. Parking Plan/Restrictions. Parking locations for local and transient aircraft are detailed
in the 7th Bomb Wing Master Aircraft Parking Plan (7 BW MAPP). All aircraft will be
marshalled along approved taxi lines and parked. Note: Currently Dyess AFB B-1, C-130 and
Transient Alert parking aprons have no wingtip restrictions.
   2.14.1. Local B-1 Parking. B-1 aircraft are parked on Alpha and Bravo rows. Aircraft
   parking in Alpha row will taxi in via B-17 to the taxilane east of Alpha row. The intent is that
   aircraft can clear Taxiway Alpha into B-17 without a follow-me. Parking marshallers will be
   available to assist in the final stages of parking. When final access is blocked, aircraft will be
   parked on the ramp centerline and backed into the appropriate Alpha row parking spot by a
   qualified tow team. Aircraft parking on Bravo row may be taxied directly to the final
   parking position, provided marshallers are available to assist in the final parking stages.
   2.14.2. Local C-130 Parking. C-130s are parked on Quebec thru X-ray rows with taxi lines
   painted to each parking position.
   2.14.3. Transient Parking. Marshallers will direct transient aircraft with the follow-me
   vehicle to final parking. Transient KC-135, B-1, B-52 or large cargo aircraft will normally
   be parked on the B-1 ramp to facilitate maintenance, but may be parked on the transient ramp
   depending on requirements.
2.15. Aircraft Special Operations Areas/Ramps. Dyess AFB does not have hot pit refueling
areas and operations.
 20                                                 DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


2.16. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield. All Protection Level 1, 2 or 3 resources as
identified in AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, will be parked in
established restricted areas.
2.17. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo. Aircrew requesting to land at Dyess AFB with hazardous
cargo will provide AMOPS with the Hazard Class/Division (HC/D), Net Explosive Weight
(NEW) and other aircraft information. AMOPS will review the approved Explosive Site Plans
(ESPs) provided by 7 BW/SEW (Weapons). FD and 7 BW Weapon safety (7 BW/SEW) will be
notified on HC/D 1.3 or 1.4 explosives not covered under AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures
for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials. NOTE: The TA overflow ramp is the primary site
for transient aircraft with HC/D 1.3 and 1.4, but has several restrictions. This site is authorized
for transient use when the duration is 24 hours or less for refueling, servicing, crew rest or
change, or maintenance. If located on TA overflow parking, the aircraft will be kept under
constant surveillance and not loaded, unloaded, nor will its explosives be handled.
2.18. Maintenance Radio Checks. To shorten radio transmissions on ATC ground frequencies,
radio maintenance personnel will use the code word “Eight Ball” when conducting radio checks
with Dyess Ground. Example: “DYESS GROUND, EIGHT BALL.” Dyess Tower will respond
“EIGHT BALL, LOUD AND CLEAR” or respond as appropriate.
2.19. Engine Test/Run-Up Procedures. Prior to any engine run, the Maintenance Operations
Centers (MOCs) must notify Dyess Ground. Upon completion of the notification, maintenance
personnel must obtain approval from Dyess Ground. Maintenance personnel must monitor
ground frequency during all engine runs and be prepared to return aircraft to ground idle when
directed by Dyess Ground for vehicular traffic or taxiing/arriving/departing aircraft.
   2.19.1. B-1 Engine Runs. Spots: A6, A12, A13, A17 (Taxilane), A20 (AGE), A23, A24,
   A25, A26 do not have blast fences and therefore engine runs are not performed on these
   spots. Engine runs are also not performed on B-17 (Taxilane). All other Alpha and Bravo
   parking spots may be utilized for engine runs. During airfield operating hours, maintenance
   personnel or aircrews conducting engine runs will not run engines above ground idle without
   approval from Dyess Ground. When the airfield is closed and Dyess Ground is not manned,
   any B-1 aircraft conducting an engine run will coordinate with Dyess Consolidated
   Command Post. The B-1 aircraft parking apron does not afford distances between parked
   aircraft and taxiing aircraft to allow for the dissipation of jet blast to acceptable levels. Dyess
   AFB therefore violates jet blast criteria and procedures have been created to address this
   concern. NOTE: During airfield operating hours, Dyess Ground will inform aircraft, when
   taxiing behind heavy jet aircraft, that engine runs are in progress by stating “ENGINE RUNS
   IN PROGRESS AT (state row/location of engine run aircraft)”. Dyess Tower will advise
   vehicles, if in direct radio communications, when transitioning behind heavy jet aircraft
   conducting engine runs.
       2.19.1.1. Engines are run in all settings. Only one engine at a time is run to max.
       2.19.1.2. During maintenance runs and crew runs, there will be a ground observer with
       direct communication to the crew. Before any engine "throttle-ups" the operator needs to
       have confirmation from the ground observer that it is clear. During the entire engine run
       the ground observer will inform the operator of any vehicle/personnel passing behind the
       aircraft. Vehicles driving shall not pass the rear of an engine running aircraft without the
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                               21


       "go ahead" from the ground observer. In some cases, Dyess Ground will advise the
       engine operator of the passing vehicle.
       2.19.1.3. In the event of emergencies, exercises or for safety purposes, maintenance or
       aircrew conducting B-1 engine runs above ground idle on the B-1 Bravo rows will be
       instructed by Dyess Ground to lower their engines to ground idle for responding aircraft,
       emergency vehicles and/or other airfield vehicles. Dyess Ground may accomplish this
       via a blank broadcast message, “Attention all aircraft, reduce engines to ground idle on
       Alpha and Bravo rows, emergency response actions in progress.” Dyess Ground may
       allow heavy jet aircraft to resume above ground idle after the aircraft/vehicles have safely
       crossed and as the situation allows.
   2.19.2. C-130 Engine Run-ups. C-130 engine run-up for maintenance is performed in their
   designated parking area. During run-up above ground idle, no aircraft will be parked directly
   behind the aircraft being run. Engine run-up for departing aircraft will be conducted IAW
   published flight manual procedures on Taxiways Bravo, Charlie, Echo, and Foxtrot.
   2.19.3. Noise Concerns. Due to excessive noise and the possibility of misunderstood
   aircrew read backs to control instructions, C-130 maintenance engine runs only up to ground
   idle may be performed on parking spots 1 through 3 of Sierra, Tango, Uniform and Victor
   rows. All other C-130 parking locations are exempt from this restriction.
       2.19.3.1. Aircraft located on the transient ramp or on Taxilane Alpha adjacent to the
       transient ramp will have engine runs limited to less than 80%.
       2.19.3.2. Quiet Hours. Standard requests will be coordinated/briefed at the pre-165 and
       approved at the Dash 165 meetings. The 7 OSS representative attending the pre-165 will
       inform the AOF/CC and 7 OSS/Airfield Operations Supervisors of the approved requests.
       Other requests for outside the normal channels will be coordinated through the AOF/CC.
       The AOF/CC will channel requests (not coordinated through the pre-165) to the 7
       OG/CC for approval. Upon approval, AMOPS shall pass quiet hour times to the Dyess
       Consolidated CP, Dyess Tower, and both MOCs at least 1 hour before activity
       commencement and issue appropriate Local (LNOTAM). NOTE: NAOC, MEDEVAC,
       SAAM and higher headquarter directed missions are exempt from noise abatement/quiet
       hour restrictions.
2.20. Aircraft Towing Procedures. The 7 BW MOC and 317 AG MOC will notify Dyess
Tower via landline of all aircraft towing operation requests. MOC will pass the aircraft tail-
number, where the aircraft will tow from/to, and whether the tow operation will access Taxilane
Alpha.
   2.20.1. All maintenance personnel (7 AMXS, 317 AMXS and TA) will gain tow approval
   from Dyess Ground on the ground control frequency.
   2.20.2. Aircraft tows will yield to taxiing aircraft.
   2.20.3. Aircraft tow operations that require access on the runway or into/through the CMA
   require direct two-way communication with Dyess Tower via Tower Net or UHF/ VHF
   radio.
   2.20.4. In the event of emergencies or exercises, aircraft tow operations in progress may be
   instructed by Dyess Ground to hold their position for responding emergency vehicles.
 22                                               DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


   2.20.5. During time when Dyess Tower is closed/unmanned, the 7 BW MOC and 317 AG
   MOC will notify Dyess Consolidated CP of all aircraft tows with termination time.
2.21. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements/Routes. The appropriate clearance criteria for aircraft
taxiing will be conducted IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground.
   2.21.1. General Taxi Procedures. All aircraft movement must be pre-approved by Dyess
   Ground prior to the operation. Aircrews will monitor ATIS broadcast prior to contacting
   Dyess Ground. Aircrews will report the current ATIS code with taxi request. Before
   proceeding onto the taxiway east of Alpha row, a follow-me vehicle must be in place to
   guide the aircraft to their final parking spot. Additionally, if taxiing in through any other
   access point (e.g. B-1), a follow-me is required before turning into the parking apron. If an
   aircraft or equipment is parked on the adjacent parking spot (e.g. B-2 or A-2), aircraft will
   not proceed until a wing-walker is available to ensure clearance. NOTE: Aircrews shall
   NOT taxi without Dyess Ground’s approval. The only exception for this is the
   approved/coordinated 317 AG’s UAOs.
       2.21.1.1. When authorized to taxi from parking, locally assigned aircrews will flash/turn
       on aircraft taxi lights. Aircrews will be marshaled out of the parking spot and will then
       proceed to Taxilane Alpha and the applicable runway.
       2.21.1.2. Aircrews will taxi on taxiway centerlines (stagger taxi is not authorized for
       local aircraft), avoid sharp/minimum radius turns, and not make turns in excess of 90
       degrees within congested areas. Aircrews must use extreme caution on ramps, taxiways
       and hangar areas for numerous uncontrolled vehicles.
       2.21.1.3. Aircrews may make a request with Dyess Ground for aircraft taxiing practice in
       the TA overflow ramp adjacent to Taxilane Alpha and south of Rebound Echo/TA’s
       parking rows. For real-time operations, aircrews will contact Dyess Ground for approval.
       Dyess Ground will pass the request to AMOPS for coordination with TA (in order to de-
       conflict operations on the ramp). AMOPS will conduct a visual sweep of this location to
       ensure that AGE has not been inadvertently left there by base agencies. AMOPS will
       notify Dyess Ground of the approval for operations. Dyess Ground will issue approval to
       the requesting aircrew. Aircrew will notify Dyess Ground regarding their completion of
       the practice taxi operations. Dyess Ground will contact AMOPS with this information.
       2.21.1.4. During periods of low ceiling/visibility, Dyess Tower will issue hold short
       instructions to taxiing aircraft and place an advisory on the ATIS as required in order to
       protect the precision approach critical areas on Taxiways Bravo and Foxtrot.
       2.21.1.5. In the event of emergencies or exercises, taxiing aircraft may be instructed by
       Dyess Ground to hold their position for responding emergency vehicles.
   2.21.2. Taxiway/Taxilane Restrictions. B-52 aircraft are required to enter and exit Runway
   16/34 via Taxiway Foxtrot and taxi to/from parking via Taxilane Alpha due to the close
   proximity of airfield signs on the intersecting taxiways and Taxilane Alpha. Wing walkers
   will be provided to ensure safe passage to/from the parking location when requested by the
   aircrew.
   2.21.3. Heavy Aircraft Jet Thrust Avoidance Procedures. Dyess Ground will issue a
   cautionary warning to aircraft (other than a B-1) taxiing behind taxiing B-1s; and to all
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              23


   aircraft taxiing on the B-1 Parking Apron behind aircraft that have received engine start
   approval (idle). These cautionary warnings also apply to vehicles in direct radio
   communication with Dyess Ground. Dyess Ground will issue instructions such as, “USE
   CAUTION, HEAVY B-1 ENGINE RUN, (Parking Location)” or “ENGINE RUNS IN
   PROGRESS AT (State Row/Location of Engine Run Aircraft).”
   2.21.4. B-1 Aircraft Recovery. Prior to entry into the Dyess traffic pattern, B-1 aircrews will
   contact Dyess Consolidated CP (Raymond 37) on UHF 311.0/349.4 to pass maintenance
   status and brevity codes, as required. Raymond 37 will inform the B-1 aircrews of parking
   spot location and will pass maintenance status and brevity codes to 7 BW MOC. B-1
   aircrews will then contact the SOF (Foxtrot) on UHF 261.0 and relay sortie effectiveness,
   weapon status (if applicable), and special requirements, if any. In the event of parking spot
   changes after B-1 aircrews have switched from Raymond 37 frequency, Raymond 37 will
   relay this information to Foxtrot via landline and Foxtrot will relay the updated parking spot
   to the aircrew as time and conditions permit. Foxtrot will provide aircrews with traffic
   pattern/airfield status to include B-1 VFR pattern operations in effect, C-130 DZ operations
   in effect, C-130 LZ operations in effect, bird watch condition, updated weather information,
   airfield construction status, and any additional pertinent information.
   2.21.5. C-130 Aircraft Recovery. Prior to entry into the Dyess traffic pattern, C-130
   aircrews will contact Raymond 37 on UHF 311.0/349.4 to pass maintenance status,
   intentions to use the LZ/DZ, and any additional pertinent information. Raymond 37 will
   inform the C-130 aircrews of parking spot location, pass arrival and maintenance status to the
   317 MOC and coordinate CFR for LZ operations, as applicable. Prior to establishing radio
   contact with Dyess Tower, C-130 aircrew will contact Foxtrot for information on traffic
   conditions. C-130 aircrew has the ability to remain on Dyess Tower’s frequency and monitor
   Foxtrot’s frequency while in the pattern. If executing DZ operations, however, C-130
   aircrew will remain contact with Marrion Tower and Dyess Tower, but not Foxtrot. In the
   event the parking spot changes after C-130 aircrew have switched from the Raymond 37
   frequency, Raymond 37 will relay this information to Foxtrot via landline and Foxtrot will
   relay the updated parking spot to the aircrew as time and conditions permit.
2.22. Combat Off-load/On-load Procedures. The primary combat off-load/on-load area is
located on Taxiway Hotel adjacent to the Tye Ramp. The secondary location is on the TA
overflow ramp adjacent to Taxilane Alpha and south of Rebound Echo/TA’s parking rows. For
real-time operations, aircrews will contact Dyess Ground for approval of combat off-load/on-
load operations. Dyess Ground will pass the request to AMOPS for coordination with TA (in
order to de-conflict operations on the ramp for the secondary location). AMOPS will conduct a
visual sweep of the primary location to ensure that AGE has not been inadvertently left there by
base agencies. Upon coordination/approval, AMOPS will send a LNOTAM closing the
coordinated location for combat off-loads/on-loads only. Upon notification, Dyess Ground will
issue approval to the requesting aircrew. Aircrew will exercise extreme vigilance when
conducting combat off-loads/on-loads. Aircrews will ensure cargo is not left unattended on the
ramp or taxiway for an extended period of time (longer than 10 minutes after the off-load).
Aircrews will notify Dyess Ground regarding their completion of the operations. Dyess Ground
will contact AMOPS with this information.
 24                                                DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


2.23. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) Procedures. ERCCs may be accomplished at
Rebound Echo (northwest corner of the transient ramp), Taxiways Bravo, Charlie or Foxtrot, the
B-1 parking ramp, or Spots 3 or 4 on all rows of the C-130 parking ramp.
   2.23.1. Rebound Echo ERCC. Aircrews will park the aircraft facing south on Rebound Echo
   and not block the taxi route on Taxilane Alpha. Minimum power settings will be used on the
   transient parking route. The SOF will determine the level of congestion on the transient
   ramp and select the location to conduct an ERCC. The SOF will coordinate the B-1 ERCC
   location with the Dyess Tower WS/SC. Aircrews will be issued instructions from the Dyess
   Ground Controllers on where to park for the ERCC. On coming and off going crews will act
   as safety observers.
   2.23.2. Taxiways Bravo, Charlie and Foxtrot ERCC. On coming and off going crews will
   act as safety observers.
2.24. Transient Alert (TA) Services/Facilities. TA is available Mon-Fri 0800L – 2130L and
closed on weekends except for emergency services. TA shall provide all personnel, equipment,
tools, materials, supervision, other items and services necessary to perform TA maintenance.
   2.24.1. TA will coordinate with the AFM or designated representative to determine parking
   location for transient aircraft. The 7th Equipment Maintenance Squadron (7 EMS) oversees
   the TA contracted personnel.
   2.24.2. TA Assistance. Transient aircraft will be picked up by the TA follow-me vehicle
   after exiting the runway and be guided to designated hold point for after landing checks. If a
   TA follow-me vehicle is not readily available when the transient aircraft exits the runway,
   Dyess Tower will provide progressive taxi instructions to the ramp area if required. Dyess
   Tower will instruct aircraft to hold at an appropriate point until a follow-me vehicle is in
   position to guide taxiing into parking. If the aircraft needs to be held at the hold point, Dyess
   Tower will inform the follow-me vehicle, otherwise the vehicle will immediately lead the
   aircraft to parking.
2.25. Procedures/Requirements for Conducting Runway Inspections/Checks.
   2.25.1. Daily Airfield Checks. All AMOPS personnel performing runway and airfield
   checks must be certified in their training record and meet the requirements listed in AFI 13-
   204 Vol 3. Airfield checks may be accomplished every two hours.
       2.25.1.1. AMOPS shall perform airfield checks to ensure primary takeoff, landing and
       taxi surfaces are operationally safe and free of FOD/obstructions. An airfield check is
       not a substitute for the required daily airfield inspection. AMOPS will conduct a FOD
       check of the taxiways and runway before the airfield opens or first flight of the day,
       whichever is sooner.
       2.25.1.2. When the LZSO is present, they will perform a check of LZ 162/342 and LZ
       162/342 to ensure suitability for operations (i.e. condition of the field and FOD potential).
       The LZSO will notify AMOPS via Ramp Net of any discrepancies.
       2.25.1.3. When the DZCO is present, they will perform a check of the Marrion DZ to
       ensure suitability for operations (i.e. condition of the field and FOD potential). The
       DZCO will notify AMOPS via Ramp Net of any discrepancies.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  25


   2.25.2. Other Required Airfield Checks. AMOPS will also perform a check of the primary
   taxiways and runway after events such as unauthorized aircraft landings, severe weather,
   airfield driving violations, natural disaster (e.g., tornado, earthquake etc.), arrivals/departures
   of wide body/heavy aircraft other than base assigned, helicopter arrivals/departures from the
   runway, upon any report of a dropped object or bird strike over or near the runway, in-flight
   emergencies (IFEs), or ground emergencies (GEs) that may affect safe airfield operations.
   The SOF on duty may waive the need for AMOPS during an in-flight emergency (IFE)
   and/or ground emergency (GE).
   2.25.3. Daily Airfield Inspections. Only qualified AMOPS personnel will conduct airfield
   inspections to ensure a safe operational environment (e.g., airfield markings, signs, lighting,
   obstacle clearances, etc.) for aircraft operations. One inspection is required per day.
2.26. Procedures for Opening and Closing the Airfield.
   2.26.1. Opening the Airfield. AMOPS will conduct an airfield opening check before
   opening the runway IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3. AMOPS will inform Dyess Tower and Dyess
   Consolidated CP of airfield opening, review NOTAMs with Dyess Tower, perform opening
   checklists, verify crash vehicle status with FD determine the Bird Watch Condition (BWC),
   and determine Runway Surface Condition (RSC) prior to flying.
      2.26.1.1. Dyess Tower will make a broadcast on all Local and Ground frequencies and
      the Ramp Net announcing Dyess Tower is open and vehicles must contact Dyess Tower
      for CMA access. In addition, Dyess Tower will utilize checklists as posted in the Tower
      OI.
   2.26.2. Closing the Airfield. AMOPS will inform Dyess Consolidated CP and Dyess Tower
   of aerodrome closure. For aerodrome closures due to conditions outside of normal closing,
   AMOPS will execute the appropriate checklist and coordinate/publish the appropriate
   NOTAM.
      2.26.2.1. Dyess Tower will make a broadcast over all Local and Ground frequencies and
      the Ramp Net announcing the Control Tower is closed.
      2.26.2.2. Runway Closures Due to Construction. Runway closures may occur for an
      extended period of time due to construction. A NOTAM will be disseminated outlining
      the closure details. If the closure will occur for more than 90 days, the closure
      information will be published in the Flight Information Publication (FLIP).
   2.26.3. UAOs. The ODO will assume responsibility for the airfield and operates in lieu of
   Dyess Tower and AMOPS to ensure operations are conducted safely, airfield security is not
   compromised, and that emergency response is available, as required. The ODO, however,
   will NOT perform ATC duties and issue ATC instructions. Refer to Chapter 10.
2.27. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) and/or Runway Condition Reading (RCR)
Values. AMOPS determines and reports RSC and RCR IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3, if applicable.
A NOTAM will be sent when the runway is anything other than dry and will include the RCR
value, if applicable.
2.28. Procedures for Suspending Runway Operations.
   2.28.1. The AFM or designated AMOPS representative is the lead authority to suspend
   runway operations in response to IFEs, FOD, bird conditions, heavy aircraft
 26                                                DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


   arrivals/departures, helicopter operations, accidents which constitute a hazard that occur on
   or near the runway, and other situations that could impact safety. AMOPS also has the
   authority to impose airfield restrictions (close/suspend and resume airfield, runway or
   taxiway operations) as well as limiting operations to specific types of aircraft. In the best
   interest of safety the SOF may waive the suspension of runway operations. NOTE: For
   temporary closures related to hazardous weather or airfield incidents, the AOF/CC/DO must
   promptly notify the 7 OSS/CC, 7 OG/CC and HQ ACC/A3AO via email or telephone.
   2.28.2. The Dyess Tower WS/SC may suspend aircraft operations to the runway for safety
   reasons.
   2.28.3. If an aircraft has an emergency (i.e. in which debris or other hazardous material
   might be left on the runway) or stops on the runway, the Dyess Tower WS/SC will
   immediately suspend aircraft operations to the runway. AMOPS will resume operations on
   the runway after a thorough check has been conducted and has concluded it to be FOD free.
2.29. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Operating in Dyess Tower. The SOF does not perform or
direct ATC functions, however, the SOF can and should coordinate with the Dyess Tower
WS/SC to facilitate better training of 7 BW and 317 AG aircraft. The SOF may coordinate with
the Dyess Tower WS/SC to redirect/restrict aircraft from VFR traffic patterns if they conflict
with local training priorities. If the SOF transmits without approval, he/she assumes
responsibility to separate aircraft.
   2.29.1. SOF Responsibilities.
       2.29.1.1. Notifies Dyess Tower when on-duty.
       2.29.1.2. Directs/coordinates all questions, concerns, or inputs to the Dyess Tower
       WS/SC. Questions concerning ATC policies should be directed to the Chief Controller
       (CCTLR) or AOF/CC. The SOF, however, will relay all equipment outages associated
       with the SOF position to the Dyess Tower WS/SC, who will initiate repair actions.
       2.29.1.3. Requests to relay information to an aircraft on any ATC assigned frequency
       will be made to the Dyess Tower WS/SC. If the SOF deems that the information is too
       technical, and after coordination with the Dyess Tower WS/SC, the SOF may
       communicate directly with an aircraft on an ATC assigned frequency. When this occurs,
       advisory instructions must be limited to that essential for flight safety and the prevention
       of a mishap.
       2.29.1.4. Advises the Dyess Tower WS/SC of weather recalls and diverts.
       2.29.1.5. Provides the Dyess Tower WS/SC with the data on emergency aircraft, as it
       becomes available. This data will include: nature of emergency, aircraft call sign,
       number of people onboard the aircraft, ordinance information, fuel status and fuel
       remaining in time, position and/or ETA, special requirements (pinning gear, stopping on
       runway, etc.) and pilots’ desires.
       2.29.1.6. Assists ATC to the maximum extent possible in recovering or diverting wing
       aircraft in event of a tower evacuation.
       2.29.1.7. Monitors Local and Ground Control positions via headset in order to preclude
       excessive coordination. Prior to exiting the tower, the SOF will ensure the SOF work
       area is clean and deselect all frequencies and positions being monitored.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                         27


  2.29.2. Dyess Tower WS/SC Responsibilities.
     2.29.2.1. Overall OPR for managing traffic patterns, applying aircraft
     sequencing/separation standards, determining IFR versus VFR airfield status,
     opening/closing tower patterns and determining the runway in use.
     2.29.2.2. Briefs the SOF on any changes to the airfield or equipment including pertinent
     weather information that may affect flying operations.
     2.29.2.3. Logs and tracks all equipment outages associated with the SOF position.
     2.29.2.4. Directs the SOF to the Dyess Tower CCTLR or AOF/CC for any questions or
     concerns about ATC/airfield policies or procedures.
     2.29.2.5. Coordinates with the SOF to use the SOF multi-channel radio during
     equipment outages. Conversely, the SOF may also request use of tower multi-channel
     radio/telephones when necessary.

                                      FLYING AREAS

3.1. Local Flying Area. The Dyess AFB local flying area is defined as a 150 NM circle around
Dyess AFB.
   3.1.1. The C-130 instrument and functional check flight area is defined by direct lines
   between San Angelo, El Dorado, Rocksprings, Goldthwaite, Paint Rock and back to San
   Angelo at an altitude below Flight Level (FL) 180. The VFR corridor is the 180 degree
   radial of the ABI VORTAC (Attachment 3).
3.2. VFR Local Training Area. The C-130 Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) area is
that part of the local flying area within a 100 NM radius of the ABI VORTAC at an altitude of
300 to 1,500’ Above Ground Level (AGL). The C-130 maneuver area is between the ABI
VORTAC 260 degree and 300 degree radials, from 10 to 30 DME, at an altitude of 7,000’ to
9,000’ MSL.
   3.2.1. Local Flying Area Restrictions.
       3.2.1.1. Small Arms Range. This range is located 0.8 miles east of Taxiway Echo. As
       soon as practical, the small arms range training personnel will notify Dyess Tower when
       the firing range is active; Dyess Tower will notify aircraft over-flights to avoid
       maneuvering directly over the firing range.
       3.2.1.2. Explosive Ordinance Disposal Range. This range is located 1.5 miles northeast
       of airfield. EOD personnel will notify AMOPS prior to the EOD range being active.
       AMOPS will then disseminate a NOTAM to indicate the EOD range is in use with
       activity occurring up to 500’ AGL. Dyess Tower will notify aircraft over-flights to avoid
       maneuvering directly over the EOD range at or below 500’ AGL.
       3.2.1.3. Dyess-assigned aircrews should, whenever possible, avoid flying through
       Sheppard MOA (at or below FL 230) and Brownwood MOA. This does not preclude the
       use of these areas for air work when properly coordinated with the FAA and area
       controller.
       3.2.1.4. When Runway 34 is in use, B-1 aircrews will delay all turns for initial takeoff
       and instrument patterns until north of Interstate 20 or 2.5 DME referenced from Dyess
       TACAN. This restriction applies to all takeoffs, even when visual cutoff has been
       requested and approved.

                     VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR) PROCEDURES

Table 4.1. VFR Weather Minimums.
4.1. VFR Weather Minimums.
   4.1.1. Dyess Tower WS/SC will determine the available traffic patterns. The pattern
   selection will be based on weather, airfield lighting, ATCALS, and visibility restrictions
   hampering tower’s ability to sequence traffic. When weather deteriorates, aircrew on VFR
   transition flights in the local traffic patterns should contact Dyess Tower for a change of
   flight plan or to terminate the flight.
       4.1.1.1. When VFR traffic patterns are closed, Dyess Tower WS/SC will notify AMOPS
       and ABI Approach. AMOPS will then notify Dyess Consolidated CP, WF and local
       flying units.
       4.1.1.2. When Dyess Tower WS/SC reopens all or part of the VFR traffic pattern, the
       notification process is the same as the closure process for the VFR patterns.
4.2. VFR Traffic Patterns.

 NOTE: For the rectangular pattern, fighter-type aircraft may be instructed by Dyess Tower to
 fly at 3,500’ MSL for the rectangular pattern when operationally advantageous

   4.2.1. All traffic will use the UHF tower frequency whenever possible to facilitate more
   efficient/safe pattern operations. Aircrews may request, or may be directed to, either the East
   or West pattern operations. When Marrion DZ, LZ 162/342 or LZ 162/342 is active, B-1
   aircrews will be directed to fly the East pattern.
   4.2.2. B-1 VFR Pattern Operations. B-1 VFR Pattern Operations will be in effect any time 2
   or more B-1 aircraft are in the Dyess VFR traffic pattern. This will be initiated by the SOF
   and the SOF will relay this information to both B-1 and C-130 aircrews to facilitate traffic
   pattern de-confliction. NOTE: Dyess Tower WS/SC retains responsibility for overall
   aircraft operations.
       4.2.2.1. When B-1 VFR Pattern Operations are in effect, C-130 aircrews will accomplish
       approaches to the LZ, use ABI Airport or other airports for transition work, depart the
 30                                                DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


      Dyess pattern or expect Dyess AFB local priorities to be in effect reference 6.1.1. (for
      example, C-130 aircrews may be directed to use the West pattern (and/or the LZs) if B-1s
      are flying on the East pattern) for approaches Runway 16/34.
      4.2.2.2. When B-1 VFR Pattern Operations are in effect, Dyess Tower will inform
      Abilene TRACON to ensure efficient handling of Dyess IFR traffic.
   4.2.3. C-130 DZ Operations. C-130 DZ Operations will be in effect any time a C-130 or C-
   130 formation is established inbound on the run-in heading and No Later Than (NLT) 10 NM
   from the DZ.
   4.2.4. C-130 LZ Operations. C-130 LZ Operations will be in effect any time a C-130 is
   established in the LZ pattern.
4.3. B-1 Visual Approach Procedures.
   4.3.1. B-1 aircrews will enter the VFR traffic pattern via ILS, visual straight in, or initial to
   the active runway.
   4.3.2. Quiet Hours/Noise Abatement Procedures.
      4.3.2.1. Dyess observes quiet hours between 2200L and 0600L. During this period, the
      east pattern will only be used to de-conflict B-1 aircraft from C-130 aircrews conducting
      training to the Marrion DZ, LZ 162/342 or LZ 162/342 and to prevent a dangerous
      situation from developing in the west traffic pattern. Units may conduct engine runs, to
      include above ground idle, during quiet hours after obtaining approval from the
      respective MOC. The MOC will limit approval for engine runs to those necessary to
      complete repairs to achieve "full mission capable" aircraft only.
      4.3.2.2. When B-1 aircrews fly the West pattern on Runway 34, they will avoid over
      flying the city of Tye.
   4.3.3. Overhead Pattern:
      4.3.3.1. Aircrews receiving radar vectors to the overhead entry point (initial) will be
      afforded radar service IAW FAAO JO 7110.65. Dyess Tower or ABI Approach will
      specify the entry point (3-5 mile final). Within the VFR pattern, entry point will be a 3-5
      NM final while remaining within Dyess Class C surface area. Aircrews will coordinate
      with Dyess Tower if requesting other than a 3-5 NM entry point and/or departing Dyess
      Class C surface area. NOTE: Aircraft that intercept the ILS glide path prior to the final
      approach fix are a potential conflict with aircraft in the visual pattern proceeding to initial
      at 3,500' MSL. The ILS glide path crosses 3,500' MSL at about 7 DME on the approach.
      4.3.3.2. Unless otherwise directed by Dyess Tower, aircrews (single ship) will initiate
      their break turn NLT midfield for protection of the overhead pattern. Formations will
      break as appropriate for spacing or as directed by tower.
      4.3.3.3. B-1 Formations. Upon initial radio contact with Dyess Tower, B-1 formations
      will request direction of break. Tower will reply with "Expect East/West break." After
      reporting 3 mile initial, Dyess Tower should not change the direction of break, unless for
      safety of flight. If it is not possible to have a formation break in the expected direction,
      Dyess Tower should give carry-through instructions.
   4.3.4. B-1 Inside Straight-In Pattern:
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              31


      4.3.4.1. The inside straight-in pattern is flown at 3,000’ MSL with a 2-3 NM final (see
      Attachment 4).
      4.3.4.2. Aircrews requesting this pattern must contact Dyess Tower for an “inside
      straight-in”.
      4.3.4.3. Daytime only: Aircrews may request an inside straight-in pattern at 3,500’ MSL
      in order to fly the overhead ground track and practice their turn to final from the perch
      point. The climbing turn will normally be flown with 1/2 flaps.
   4.3.5. B-1 Outside Straight-In Pattern:
      4.3.5.1. The outside straight-in pattern is flown at 3,000’ MSL at approximately 250-275
      KIAS with a 3-5 NM turn to final (see Attachment 4).
      4.3.5.2. Aircrews requesting this pattern must contact Dyess Tower for an “outside
      straight-in”.
      4.3.5.3. Aircrews must obtain specific approval from Dyess Tower if requesting a "no
      flap" pattern.
      4.3.5.4. B-1 aircrews may fly either East or West patterns. When Marrion DZ, LZ
      162/342 or LZ 162/342 is active, B-1 aircrew will be directed to fly the East pattern to the
      main runway. In the event the Marrion DZ, LZ 162/342 or LZ 162/342 is active and the
      East pattern is unavailable, the Dyess Tower will advise the aircrews. In this situation,
      aircrews will climb to 3,000’ MSL before turning crosswind and maintain at or above
      3,000’ MSL until turning from base leg to final.
      4.3.5.5. In order to remain within Dyess-controlled airspace, aircrews operating in the
      East outside straight-in pattern will remain west of Winters Freeway (US 83/84), unless
      required for safety of flight.
4.4. Additional VFR Flying Procedures.
   4.4.1. VFR to IFR Procedures. Aircrews that request IFR handling after a VFR pattern must
   notify Dyess Tower at least one pattern ahead of time for Dyess Tower and ABI Departure
   coordination. Aircrews operating from LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342 may obtain IFR
   clearance prior to departure.
   4.4.2. VFR Departures. Aircrews departing VFR will request VFR flight following through
   AMOPS in the form of a flight plan.
4.5. Special Procedures.
   4.5.1. 360o - Overhead Pattern Protection.
      4.5.1.1. When directed by Dyess Tower, all wing assigned/attached aircrews will
      maintain at or below 3,000’ MSL until passing departure end of runway to protect the
      360° overhead pattern. Tower may issue 2500’ MSL if a heavy aircraft is in the overhead.
      4.5.1.2. Transient aircrews will be issued pertinent restrictions with departure
      instructions/climb-out/go-around procedures, when warranted.
   4.5.2. Helicopters. Helicopters will normally depart from the runway. Departures from the
   transient ramp and taxiways may be permitted, provided there is at least 200’ clearance from
 32                                                DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


   any other stationary aircraft (including other helicopters); the helicopter will not fly over any
   personnel, aircraft or populated portion of the base; and Dyess Tower has the helicopter in
   sight. In addition, apply separation and phraseology specified in FAAO JO 7110.65. Due to
   FOD concerns, hover checks will be conducted over paved surfaces.
   4.5.3. Paradrop Operations. Refer to Para 4.10.
   4.5.4. Crop Dusting. Crop dusting companies shall contact Dyess Tower and inform of
   projected operations IAW Aerial Applicator Aircraft and Texas Boll Weevil Eradication
   Foundation, Inc. LOA. Crop dusting companies will provide Dyess Tower the aircraft tail
   number, aircraft type and color, and a specific time block to conduct operations within a
   specified area. Dyess Tower will approve operations within Dyess Class C based on known
   traffic conditions. Dyess Tower will notify Dyess Consolidated CP and 7 SFS with the
   time/location of crop dusting operations when crop dusting occurs in the vicinity of Dyess
   AFB. Dyess Tower will obtain control of Dyess Class C and advise the ABI TRACON of all
   crop dusting operations. Dyess Tower will also provide traffic advisories as necessary and
   include advisory on the ATIS. Dyess Tower shall terminate crop dusting operations when
   safety becomes a concern.
   4.5.5. Night Vision Devices (NVDs) Operations. The 7 BW and 317 AG Night Vision
   Device (NVD) LOA addresses NVD/NVG operations conducted at Dyess.
   4.5.6. Unusual Maneuvers. Unusual maneuvers other than those contained in this instruction
   and other local operating procedures require 7 OG/CC and higher headquarters approval (to
   include appropriate coordination with the FAA).
4.6. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Procedures. RSRS is authorized for all
ACC and 317 AG aircraft.

 Reference: AFI 11-202_V3 ACC Sup 1

   4.6.1. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight may be
   jeopardized. In these cases, Dyess Tower will apply appropriate separation standards
   published in FAAO JO 7110.65.
   4.6.2. Aircrews are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual
   separation or operating under VFR. When operating IFR or under ATC instructions, Dyess
   Tower must ensure standard wake turbulence separation exists.
   4.6.3. Aircraft must maintain at least 500’ vertical separation when overflying aircraft on the
   runway.
4.7. Intersection Departures. Refer to the airfield diagram in Attachment 2.
   4.6.1. Dyess Tower may initiate and approve intersection takeoffs to provide a more
   efficient movement of air traffic, to minimize departure delays, and to reduce taxi distance.
   Aircrews requesting intersection departures should be aware that more restrictive wake
   turbulence separation criteria apply.
 34                                             DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


   4.6.2. Aircrews are responsible to determine that sufficient runway length is available to
   permit a safe takeoff and retain the prerogative to use the full runway length or select a
   different intersection. Aircrews will advise Dyess Tower of their intentions.
4.8. Combat Departure/Arrival Procedures. B-1 combat departure/arrival procedures will be
conducted IAW Combat Departure and Arrival Procedures Letter of Agreement between 7 BW,
Ft Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and ABI TRACON.
4.9. C-130 Normal Visual Approach Procedures.
   4.9.1. C-130 aircrews will call Dyess Tower prior to a 15 NM reporting point (FALCON,
   VOLUNTEER, LONGHORN, NITANY, or SOONER) and request entry into the VFR
   pattern. Entry altitude is at or above 3,500’ MSL. If approved, Dyess Tower will direct C-
   130 aircrews to a specific 5 NM reporting point (RAZORBACK, AGGIE, HURRICANE,
   SEMINOLE, RATTLER). If not approved, or communication has not been established, C-
   130 aircrews will hold outside the 15 NM reporting point. (Refer to Para 7.8 for Lost
   Communications procedures.) Aircraft will descend to 3,000’ MSL once they are within
   Dyess Class C (inside 5 NM from the center point of Runway 16/34). See Attachment 12 for
   15 NM and 5 NM C-130 aircrews’ reporting points.
      4.9.1.1. Once inside 15 NM, but prior to entry into the VFR pattern, Dyess Tower may
      instruct C-130 aircrews to reenter at the VFR reporting point. C-130 aircrews will fly
      back to the 15 NM VFR reporting point and request entry into the VFR pattern IAW Para
      4.9.1.
   4.9.2. Once entry is approved, C-130 aircrews will report at the 5 NM reporting point prior
   to entering the VFR pattern.
   4.9.3. When B-1 VFR pattern operations are in effect (two or more B-1s), C-130 aircrews
   are restricted from flying tactical abeam and tactical teardrop patterns. Dyess Tower
   will only authorize C-130 aircrews to enter the VFR pattern via AGGIE or SEMINOLE for a
   downwind recovery.
   4.9.4. C-130 Downwind Recovery. C-130 aircrews will make a 45-degree entry to the mid-
   field downwind as required. The downwind recovery is flown at 3,000’ MSL (2,500' MSL
   for LZ 162/342).
   4.9.5. C-130 Closed Pattern. The C-130 closed pattern will be flown at 3,000’ MSL (2,500’
   MSL for LZ 162/342). Depending on runway availability, C-130 aircrews may execute
   closed patterns to Runway 16/34, LZ 162/342 or LZ 162/342.
4.10. C-130 Tactical Visual Approach Procedures.
   4.10.1. C-130 Tactical Visual Approach Procedures will be conducted IAW Abilene ATC,
   317th Airlift Group and Dyess AFB Tower Letter of Agreement- “Tactical Approach
   Procedures at Dyess Air Force Base.”
   4.10.2. C-130 Tactical Abeam Pattern. The C-130 tactical abeam pattern will normally be
   initiated from the 5 NM reporting point HURRICANE. Pattern entry is perpendicular to the
   runway/LZ to which the approach is being made. C-130 aircrews will normally enter the
   pattern at 500’ AGL and begin maneuvering after crossing over the landing area. See
   Attachment 8.

      4.10.2.1. The C-130 Tactical Abeam Pattern is not authorized during B-1 VFR
      pattern operations to avoid crossing the main runway centerline.
   4.10.3. C-130 Tactical Teardrop Pattern. The C-130 tactical teardrop pattern will normally
   be initiated from the 5 NM reporting points RATTLER or RAZORBACK. Pattern entry is
   opposite the direction of landing traffic. C-130 aircrews will normally enter the pattern at
   500’ AGL with a circling maneuver begun within 1.5 NM from the approach end of the
   landing runway. See Attachment 8.
      4.10.3.1. The C-130 Tactical Teardrop Pattern is not authorized during B-1 VFR pattern
      operations to avoid opposite direction traffic conflicts.
   4.10.4. C-130 Tactical Steep Pattern. The C-130 tactical steep pattern is a high overhead
   approach and will normally be initiated from the 5 NM reporting points RATTLER or
   RAZORBACK. Pattern entry altitude is normally no lower than 4,000’ above field elevation
   with aircraft beginning descent during the first 180 degree turn to the requested
   runway/landing zone. This approach can also be conducted for opposite direction landing.
   Entry altitude will be included in the request. See Attachment 8.
   4.10.5. C-130 Tactical Straight-In Pattern. The C-130 tactical straight-in pattern will
   normally be initiated from the 5 NM reporting points RATTLER or RAZORBACK. This
   pattern may be done in addition to a high-speed descent at or below 12,000’ MSL with
   coordination from Abilene Approach/Dyess Tower.
4.11. Landing Zone Procedures.
   4.11.1. The 317 AG utilizes landing zones, LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342, for tactical training
   purposes. Non-base assigned tactically qualified aircrews may also use LZ 162/342 and LZ
   162/342 after advanced coordination and briefings with the 317 OSS/OSK. In turn, 317
   OSS/OSK will notify the Operational Support Specialist (OSS) of scheduled non-base
   assigned aircrew training to LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342. The 317 OSS/OSK will also
   advise AMOPS of authorized users prior to non-base assigned aircraft conducting operations
   to the landing zones.
      4.11.1.1. The condition of the landing surface area is determined by the OSS, Landing
      Zone Control Officer (LZCO), Landing Zone Safety Officer (LZSO) or Drop Zone
      Control Officer (DZCO) who in turn will pass the landing surface check status to
      AMOPS at x-2515. These actions are typically accomplished on Monday morning/night
      and throughout the week during nighttime operations to the LZs. At this time, the OSS,
      LZCO or LZSO will determine if rutting, pot holes or other deficiencies will adversely
      affect the safety of the landing aircraft or its suitability for operational use. During
      daytime operations, AMOPS will accomplish subsequent checks of the LZs IAW
      AFI 13-204 Vol 3.
      4.11.1.2. Prior to nighttime aircraft operations to the LZs, the OSS, LZCO, LZSO or
      DZCO will complete the airfield lighting checks covering areas west of the Runway
      16/34 and pass the status to AMOPS. If no nighttime operations are scheduled to the
      LZs, AMOPS will perform lighting checks of the areas to the west of Runway 16/34.
      AMOPS will coordinate repairs for lighting outages/concerns with Airfield Lighting.
      NOTE: Over flight of the city of Tye is authorized when tactical operations dictate.

     4.12.3.3. “Airdrops Complete” – Term used by DZCO to inform Dyess Tower that an
     airdrop that was a potential impact to aircraft operations to Runway 16/34 is no longer a
     threat. The DZCO will monitor the falling equipment and/or personnel. The DZCO will
     also conduct a FOD check of Taxiway Golf, if impacted. Runway 16/34 and Taxiway
     Golf status will revert to open unless DZCO has determined otherwise.
     4.12.3.4. “Marrion DZ Closed” – When the Marrion DZ is closed, airdrops will cease
     and are not allowed in the area. LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342 will not be used until the
     DZCO has notified tower that the LZs are open.
     4.12.3.5. “LZs Your Control” – This term is used for communications between
     Dyess Tower and DZCO or LZCO/LZSO. Once the DZCO or LZCO/LZSO gives
     control of the LZs to Dyess Tower, aircraft are allowed to operate/conduct approaches to
     LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342. This term also signifies that the DZCO has determined that
     LZs and connecting taxiways are free of FOD and personnel/equipment/airdrop
     loads/destroyed panel markers are removed. Prior to departing the area, the DZCO or
     LZCO/LZSO will notify Dyess Tower of any discrepancies. NOTE 1: If any confusion
     arises on the status of the DZ or LZs between the DZCO, LZCO/LZSO and Dyess Tower
     only, the status of the drop zone will be “closed.” LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342 will also
     remain closed to other aircraft operations. NOTE 2: The status (terms) of the DZ and
     LZs will be passed from the DZCO to Dyess Tower. NOTE 3: During personnel and
     equipment airdrops, C-130 aircraft tow operations to Taxiway Golf are not authorized. If
     a C-130 aircraft is already positioned on Taxiway Golf for maintenance, the 317 AG/CC
     may waive the calibration operations on Taxiway Golf to occur during the airdrops.
     NOTE 4: Refer to the High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) /High Altitude High
     Opening (HAHO) Parachute Procedures At Dyess Air Force Base Letter of Agreement
     between 317 AG, 7 OG, and ABI TRACON for additional C-130 HALO/HAHO
     Procedures.
  4.12.4. Drop Zone Responsibilities:
     4.12.4.1. DZCO Responsibilities. The DZCO will be present for all airdrop operations.
     The DZCO will be located in the DZ area one hour prior to the first arrival and the last to
     leave for all airdrop operations.
         4.12.4.1.1. The DZCO is responsible for opening/closing the drop zones and
         allowing aircraft to perform airdrop operations there. When a DZCO is present at the
         Marrion DZ, they may perform the duties of the LZCO/LZSO (if certified) for LZ
         operations. An LZCO/LZSO is not needed to conduct daytime operations to the LZs.
         They are, however, required for nighttime operations to the LZs.
         4.12.4.1.2. Ensure airdrop recovery vehicles, equipment and personnel remain at
         least 100’ from edges of LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342 when the Marrion DZ is
         “closed” (See Para 4.12.3.4.). Vehicles and personnel that must approach within 100’
         of the active LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342, will contact Dyess Tower, DZCO or
         LZCO/LZSO via the Tower Net or Marrion Tower frequencies.
         4.12.4.1.3. Ensure that CFR equipment and any other unauthorized vehicles are off
         the DZ at least 10 minutes prior to any airdrops.

        4.12.4.1.5. The DZCO shall inform Dyess Tower when last jumper is on the ground.
     4.12.4.2. FD Responsibilities. IAW AFI 32-2001 and Technical Implementation Guide
     403, fire vehicles must be able to respond within 5 minutes to all areas in the response
     zone (active runways and landing zones). Because Dyess FD is able to respond to any
     incident on LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342 within 5 minutes they will no longer be required
     to position a vehicle on the west side of the runway prior to and during any assault zone
     landings to LZ 162/342 or LZ 162/342.
     4.12.4.3. Aircrew Responsibilities. Aircrews will notify Dyess Tower of static line
     personnel airdrops at Marrion DZ on initial contact or at least 10 minutes prior to
     departing Dyess AFB. Aircrews will provide the estimated jump time and number of
     jumpers to Dyess Tower. Aircrews will also advise Dyess Tower if an opposite traffic
     run-in to the DZ is requested.
        4.12.4.3.1. Aircrews will advise Dyess Tower on initial contact prior to conducting
        the inbound run-in to release jumpers. Aircrews will monitor Dyess UHF Tower
        frequency during the run-in to receive any necessary ATC instructions. The
        formation lead is responsible for obtaining and maintaining direct radio
        communications with the DZCO. If radio communications between the DZCO and
        the formation lead cannot be obtained or maintained, aircrews will not airdrop in the
        DZ.
        4.12.4.3.2. Aircrews may be directed by Dyess Tower to discontinue the run-in at
        any point up to the 1 minute advisory (a point approximately 2.2 NM from the DZ
        point of impact). NOTE: During periods of Abilene radar outages, aircrews will
        report to Dyess Tower at Initial Point (IP) North or IP South for clearance into the
        Dyess airspace with the number of aircraft in formation, type of release (VIS or SKE)
        and recovery following drop. The IP North for Marrion DZ is a point 21.8 NM north
        of the DZ on DZ centerline. The IP South is a point 16.8 NM south of the DZ on the
        DZ centerline.
        4.12.4.3.3. Aircrews will execute an immediate breakout to the west when directed
        while on approach to the DZ and remain in formation.
        4.12.4.3.4. Aircrews will advise Dyess Tower when jumpers have departed the
        aircraft and the actual number of jumpers. Example: “(CALL SIGN), SIX JUMPERS
        AWAY.”
        4.12.4.3.5. Aircrews will also coordinate equipment drop procedures with Dyess
        Tower.
     4.12.4.4. Dyess Tower Responsibilities. Dyess Tower retains air traffic control
     responsibility for all aircraft operating in the Marrion DZ. Dyess Tower is responsible
     for ensuring the DZCO has opened the DZ prior to allowing aircraft to use the DZ.
     Dyess Tower will terminate or delay operations as necessary when deteriorating weather
     conditions or other circumstances jeopardize the safety of the DZ operations. Dyess

     Tower will relay information between the SOF (if on duty) and C-130 aircraft operating
     on Marrion DZ.
         4.12.4.4.1. Dyess Tower will coordinate with Marrion Tower and Abilene TRACON
         prior to permitting aircraft to conduct airdrops. NOTE: Marrion Tower will be in
         direct radio communications with the aircrew conducting the airdrop and will be
         providing advisories to the aircrew. Aircrews will monitor Dyess Tower frequency
         for control instructions.
         4.12.4.4.2. Dyess Tower will advise ABI TRACON of C-130 aircraft operations
         (except SKE) when aircraft are at IP North/South, if they have not already been
         advised.
         4.12.4.4.3. Dyess Tower shall retain the option to discontinue a formation drop at
         any point up to the tactical airdrop 1 minute advisory (a point approximately 2.2 NM
         from the DZ point of impact). If a formation breakout is required, Dyess Tower will
         use the following phraseology: “(FORMATION CALL SIGN), BREAKOUT TO THE
         WEST” and provide additional instructions to facilitate traffic separation. Expect
         radar vectors under IFR control.
     4.12.4.5. AMOPS Responsibilities. AMOPS will issue a safety NOTAM for all
     personnel drops. AMOPS will also send a NOTAM for equipment drops.
  4.12.5. C-130 aircrews will fly either Marrion DZ 153 or Marrion DZ 342. DZ operations
  will be in effect when C-130 aircrews are within 10 NM of Marrion DZ and are established
  on the run-in heading. Based on C-130 run-in airspeeds, it will take approximately 4 minutes
  from the 10 NM point until release.
     4.12.5.1. Marrion DZ 153. The C-130 initial point (IP) is designated as the ABI
     326/018. From this point, C-130 aircrews will be on a run-in heading of 153 degrees.
     4.12.5.2. Marrion DZ 342. The C-130 IP is designated as the ABI 162/019. From this
     point, C-130 aircrews will be on a run-in heading of 342 degrees.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                               43

                  INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR) PROCEDURES

5.1. Radar Traffic Patterns. ABI Approach controls the radar traffic pattern to Dyess AFB.
Radar traffic pattern is normally to the west of Dyess AFB at 4000’ MSL.
5.2. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures. ABI Approach will vector aircraft requesting radar
vectors to initial no closer than 7NM from the runway unless otherwise coordinated with Dyess
Tower and will transfer radio communications before the aircraft enters Dyess’ airspace.
5.3. Instrument Approaches. Instrument approaches to Runway 16/34 are published in the
FLIP Terminal High- And Low-Altitude Instrument Approach Procedures. IFR circling
procedures are not authorized to LZs 162/342 and 162/342 since these landing surfaces does not
meet IFR standards. Aircrew may cancel IFR and transition to the LZs under VFR. NOTE 1:
Aircraft on circling approaches typically circle west of the base; however, ATC may permit
circling to the east during IFR conditions to safely complete a full-stop landing. NOTE 2
Aircraft that intercept the ILS glide path prior to the final approach fix are a potential conflict
with aircraft in the visual pattern proceeding to initial at 3,500' MSL. The ILS glide path crosses
3,500' MSL at about 7 DME on the approach.
5.4. Availability/Restrictions for Approach Surveillance Radar (ASR) Approaches. ABI
Approach controls the ASR approach into Dyess AFB. The availability of the ASR approach is
based on ABI Approach’s current manning.
5.5. Availability/Restrictions for Precision Approach Radar (PAR) Approaches. A PAR
approach is not available at Dyess AFB.
5.6. Airborne Radar Approaches. Airborne Radar Approaches (C-130) and Airborne
Instrument Landing Approaches (B-1) may be flown to either Runway 16 or 34. These
approaches must be flown in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) under VFR and must be
approved by ABI Approach. NOTE: Aircrew must be aware that remaining at high altitude
until close to the runway is a potential conflict with the overhead pattern.
5.7. Local Departure Procedures. Aircraft departing Dyess AFB on an IFR clearance will
depart on a runway heading at 4000’ (unless issues otherwise) IAW routes and altitudes as
specified in the published and filed departure procedures or via radar vectors with Abilene.
   5.7.1. IFR aircraft may request a radar-vectored departure to a high/low altitude
   fix. Aircrews should not file VFR to a transition fix in order to expedite departure.
   5.7.2. Base-assigned C-130 aircrews are authorized to file and fly the Coleman, Nugen or
   Noodle departure procedures for local training purposes only.
5.8. No-Light Minimums. No-light minimums are published on approach plates in FLIP.
AMOPS will issue NOTAMs via HQ ACC/A3AOT when no-light minimums are in effect.

           6.1.1.7.3. C-130 IFR Arrivals
           6.1.1.7.4. C-130 VFR Pattern Approaches
           6.1.1.7.5. After coordination with the Dyess Tower WS/SC, the SOF may modify
           priorities in paragraph 6.1.1.7 based on B-1 and C-130 training requirements. Local
           B-1 and C-130 aircrews will check-in with the SOF, “Foxtrot”, on UHF 261.0.
       6.1.1.8. Normal Aircraft Departures.
       6.1.1.9. Transient Practice Approaches. NOTE: Flight check aircraft is provided
       special handling in order to expedite the inspection of NAVAIDs. Dyess Tower will
       clear the flight check aircraft according to the aircrews’ request as soon as practical.
       Dyess Tower will not ask the flight check aircrew to deviate from their planned action
       except to preclude an emergency situation.
6.2. Standard Climb-Out Instructions. Standard climb out procedures for aircraft departing
Dyess AFB will fly runway heading and maintain 4000’ MSL.
6.3. Opposite Direction Take-Offs and Landings. All opposite direction arrivals including
practice approaches/departures will be coordinated between Dyess Tower and ABI Approach.
Except for emergency/precautionary and/or flight inspection aircraft, first priority will be given
to traffic approaching the primary runway.
   6.3.1. When aircraft request opposite direction operations, Dyess Tower will consider other
   traffic in the pattern and coordinate with the ABI Approach prior to approval.
   6.3.2. When an aircraft on an opposite direction approach has completed the approach, the
   published missed approach shall be executed unless clearance for a landing has been
   approved or other instructions have been given by Dyess Tower or ABI Approach.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                45


   6.3.3. Opposite direction traffic shall be controlled IAW Letter of Agreement, Control,
   Coordination, and Separation Procedures, between ABI Approach and Dyess AFB Tower:
       6.3.3.1. Arrival Versus Arrival. Tower shall not allow an opposite direction arrival to
       cross the landing threshold or an aircraft in the VFR pattern to turn on final when an IFR
       arrival is within 10 NM of the active runway
       6.3.3.2. Departure Versus Arrival:
           6.3.3.2.1. Opposite Direction Departure. All opposite direction departures shall be
           coordinated with ABI Approach prior to the aircraft taxiing to the runway to be used.
           6.3.3.2.2. IFR/VFR departures will not be released when an opposite direction
           approach is within 10 NM from runway.
   6.3.4. Dyess Tower WS/SC may offer approaches to the inactive runway if weather
   conditions permit its use or upon aircrew request, as long as traffic to the active runway is not
   disrupted. NOTE: Examples of conditions: tailwinds less than 5 knots, runway in use is
   below published minimums, NAVAID outage, variable wind conditions, etc.
   6.3.5. Arrivals Versus Departures/Low Approach/Touch-and-Go. An opposite direction IFR
   arrival will not be permitted within 10 NM of the runway until the IFR departure, low
   approach, or touch-and-go has departed/turned and is no longer a factor. NOTE:
   Simultaneous VFR operations at LZ 162/342 are authorized IAW FAAO JO 7110.65
   whenever the opposite direction traffic is conducting VFR operations to the main runway, or
   visual separation is provided by Dyess Tower. Aircraft operating under these conditions
   must remain at least 1,400’ from the other runway's extended centerline. This operation is
   not authorized at nighttime.
6.4. Break-out/Go-Around/Missed Approach/Carry Straight Through Procedures.
   6.4.1. Breakouts. Breakouts may be initiated for an IFR aircraft located 5 NM or more from
   the runway. In the event of a breakout, the aircraft shall not be allowed to continue an
   approach. ATC may issue “FLY RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 4,000
   FEET MSL” as breakout instructions to aircraft; however, controllers will not use the term
   “breakout” in their radio transmissions. Dyess Tower or ABI Approach may initiate
   breakout procedures at anytime.
   6.4.2. Go Arounds. A go-around is normally initiated for aircraft inside of 5 NM from the
   runway. Tower initiates a go-around whenever an aircraft cannot be permitted to continue an
   approach to the landing threshold. In the event of a go-around, the aircraft may be issued
   alternate climb-out instructions from Dyess Tower.
   6.4.3. Missed Approach. If aircraft is operating under IFR or is unable to maintain VFR, the
   aircraft will execute a missed approach and return to Abilene Approach Control.
   6.4.4. Carry Straight Through. When on initial, aircraft directed to “CARRY STRAIGHT
   THROUGH” will not initiate a break turn and will coordinate with Dyess Tower for further
   requests.
6.5. Altitude Restricted Low Approach: Dyess Tower may clear an aircraft for a restricted
low approach over personnel or over a preceding landing or taxiing aircraft. Dyess Tower will
not clear an aircraft for an altitude restricted low approach over aircraft in takeoff position.
 46                                                DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


Dyess Tower will inform personnel on runway/overrun of the restricted low approach aircraft
and altitude, time permitting. Dyess Tower will also follow procedures in AFI 13-204 Vol 3.
6.6. Station Keeping Equipment (SKE) Procedures. The procedures for SKE run-ins are
found in the Abilene Air Traffic Control Tower, 317th Airlift Group and Dyess AFB LOA.
6.7. Aerial Displays (Fly-bys, High Speed Passes). ATC will not approve unscheduled aerial
displays, nonstandard approaches, paradrops, or any other non-standard operation. Requests for
such maneuvers will be referred to 7 OG/CC via the AOF/CC, 7 OG/OGV or 317 AG/AGV.
   6.7.1. Fly-bys. Scheduled fly-by operations supporting base ceremonies must be authorized
   by the 7 OG/CC. Coordination will be accomplished with the AOF/CC at least 24 hours in
   advance.
   6.7.2. Under no circumstances will non-ATC agencies be authorized to broadcast on ATC
   frequencies.
   6.7.3. High-Speed Passes. High-speed passes along Runway 16/34 are authorized IAW the
   Certificate of Waiver of Authorization issued by the FAA. Aircrew will operate aircraft
   strictly within the special provisions outlined in the issued certificate by the FAA.
       6.7.3.1. Dyess Tower retains the authority to disapprove the high-speed pass at any time
       based upon traffic conditions or flight safety. Dyess Tower will not approve high-speed
       passes when the reported visibility at Dyess AFB is less than 5 SMs.
       6.7.3.2. High-speed passes are not afforded any special handling/priority unless
       associated with an approved function. The SOF will be responsible to prioritize aircraft
       conducting high-speed passes based on safe pattern activity.
       6.7.3.3. The SOF will be present in Dyess Tower prior to any high-speed pass being
       approved. The SOF will also ensure all participants are thoroughly briefed on special
       rules and manner/order of events prior to the high-speed pass.
6.8. Chaff and Flares. Aircrews returning from chaff and flare drop missions will set all
dispenser systems to a SAFE/standby setting prior to entering the traffic pattern. Chaff and flares
may be loaded or downloaded on the airfield except inside hangars or nose docks.
6.9. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Operation/Procedures. Dyess AFB does not have
UAS aircraft assigned to it. Dyess AFB, however, does maintain an LOA with Beale AFB for
emergency (divert) landing UAS ops.
6.10. Aero Club Operations. Dyess AFB does not have aero club operations.
6.11. Civil Use of Military ATCALS. Civil aircraft are authorized to make practice instrument
approaches at Dyess AFB. Civil aircraft conducting practice approaches are not authorized to
land at Dyess (this includes stop-and-goes/touch-and-goes). Civil aircraft practice approaches
are restricted to periods of light traffic as determined by the Dyess Tower WS/SC. Dyess Tower
may terminate practice approaches at any time.
6.12. Model Aircraft Flying. Model aircraft flying on Dyess AFB is limited to a maximum
altitude of 150’ (height of the base water tower), east of a north-south line running through Fifth
Street. Flights above 150’ require approval from the AFM or AOF/CC and Dyess Tower.
AMOPS shall transmit a NOTAM for the duration of the activities.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                         47


6.13. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. Dyess Tower will issue weather
information (to include hazardous and severe weather) to aircrew via the ATIS. The SOF or the
Dyess Consolidated CP will advise Dyess Tower when either a weather or operational recall of
airborne aircraft due to weather or other concerns is required. Refer to DYESSAFBI 15-101,
Weather Support Procedures.
6.14. Bird/Wildlife Control. Refer to DYESSAFB OPLAN 91-212 for local Bird/Aircraft
Strike Hazard (BASH) program guidelines.
6.15. Bird Watch Conditions (BWCs). The SOF is responsible for raising and lowering the
Bird Watch Condition (BWC) while on duty. If the SOF is not on duty, AMOPS is responsible
for declaring BWCs. Refer to DYESSAFB OPLAN 91-212 for locally established BWC
conditions.
 48                                               DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


                                           Chapter 7

                              EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

7.1. Operation of the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS).
   7.1.1. Dyess Tower operates the PCAS. The PCAS will be tested Monday through Friday
   between 0730L - 0800L and if open on weekends/holidays, the PCAS will be tested within
   the first hour of airfield operations. All agencies shall report clarity of transmission and
   initials. Dyess Tower maintains results of the PCAS daily check. Dyess Tower will call
   agencies if they are unable to answer the PCAS. Users will report malfunctions to telephone
   maintenance, 7 CS/SCOI.
   7.1.2. PCAS Agencies. The following agencies have two-way communications on the
   PCAS: AMOPS, FD, and 7th Medical Group (MDG - Aerospace Medicine, the Medical
   Information Center [MIC] and Medical Control Center [MCC]). Agencies with receive-only
   capability on the PCAS include 7 MOS MOC and Central Security Control (CSC). The 7
   OG/CC is the approval authority for requested changes to the PCAS agency list.
   7.1.3. Phone Discipline. All parties remain on the PCAS line until Dyess Tower terminates
   the call with the words “SECURE THE NET”. Emergency data often changes frequently.
   This procedure prevents additional time consuming notifications.
   7.1.4. Reasons for PCAS Activation:
      7.1.4.1. Mishap, In-Flight or Ground Emergencies (IFEs or GEs).
      7.1.4.2. External Stores Jettison.
      7.1.4.3. Unauthorized Landings.
      7.1.4.4. Unauthorized Taxi/Movement (Anti-hijacking).
      7.1.4.5. Hot Brakes.
      7.1.4.6. Hung Ordinance.
      7.1.4.7. Tower Evacuations.
      7.1.4.8. Hangar Alarms (At FD’s Request).
      7.1.4.9. Base Disaster (At FD’s Request).
      7.1.4.10. Practice Disaster Exercise. Dyess Tower will preface and terminate all exercise
      messages with “EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXERCISE.”
      7.1.4.11. When requested by an aircraft aircrew member, SOF, AMOPS, 7 BW Dyess
      Consolidated CP, FD or the Dyess Tower WS/SC. NOTE: The PCAS is not activated to
      relay non-emergency related data (e.g. FPCON changes, Emergency Operations Center
      (EOC) recalls). Agencies must utilize other available means (e.g. contact AMOPS for
      secondary crash net activation, giant voice).
7.2. Operation of the Secondary Crash Net (SCN).
   7.2.1. AMOPS activates the SCN. The SCN is checked daily immediately after the PCAS
   check. All agencies report clarity of transmission and initials. AMOPS maintains the results
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            49


   of the daily SCN check. AMOPS will call agencies not answering via telephone to verify a
   malfunction does/does not exist. Users are responsible to report malfunctions to telephone
   maintenance, 7 CS/SCOI. All agencies on the SCN must use a noise reduction feature such
   as push-to-talk handsets or Confidencor (Trademark of National Communications Inc.) that
   filters out background noise.
   7.2.2. SCN Agencies. The following agencies have two-way communications with AMOPS
   on the SCN: FD, Dyess Consolidated CP, 7 BW MOC, 317 MOC, 7 MUNS/Munitions
   Control, 7 MDG, CSC, Law Enforcement (LE) Desk, 7 MSG/CC, 7 CES, 7 CES/Readiness
   and WF. Agencies with receive-only capability include Motor Pool, 7 BW Safety, 7 BW
   Public Affairs, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Operations. Only those agencies
   that require immediate response to protect/preserve life, limb and/or property will be on the
   SCN. The AFM is the SCN manager and coordinates changes through the 7 OSS/CC for
   approval/disapproval.
   7.2.3. Phone Discipline. AMOPS will state information over the SCN and repeat it. Upon
   completion, AMOPS will answer any questions. Acknowledgment is unnecessary as an
   automatic light panel accomplishes this purpose. Each agency must copy all the information
   and then secure the crash phone to be ready for the next message. AMOPS will notify Dyess
   Tower of all SCN activations unless the information is first passed via the PCAS.
   7.2.4. Reasons for SCN Activation. The SCN is activated to expeditiously relay information
   received from the PCAS. In addition, the SCN will be used to relay critical aircraft and
   airfield information.
      7.2.4.1. IFEs.
      7.2.4.2. GEs.
      7.2.4.3. Hazardous Weather Warnings.
      7.2.4.4. Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Levels.
      7.2.4.5. Disaster Response Force (DRF) Activations/Recalls.
      7.2.4.6. Bomb Threats or Terrorist Activities.
      7.2.4.7. As requested by the EOC Director to support the Installation Emergency
      Management Plan (IEMP) outlined in AFI 10-2501. NOTE: Dyess Consolidated CP
      may relay emergency information other than information critical to aircraft and airfield
      operations, i.e. FPCON level changes, EOC recall, exercise, actual or exercise bomb
      threats or terrorist activities through the SCN. Dyess Consolidated CP will contact
      AMOPS and request activation of the SCN. AMOPS will activate the SCN and request
      all agencies to “STANDBY”. AMOPS will then either advise Dyess Consolidated CP
      controller to relay their message or AMOPS will relay the information for them.
7.3. Emergency Response Procedures (On/Off-Base). Aircrew, SOF or ATC may declare an
aircraft emergency. The following covers responses during IFEs/GEs. Note: The SOF on duty
may waive the need for AMOPS during an in-flight emergency (IFE) and/or ground emergency
(GE).
   7.3.1. Dyess Tower Responsibilities:
 50                                                DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


       7.3.1.1. Activate the PCAS and relay the following information, if available: nature of
       emergency, aircraft identification and type, aircrew’s desires, personnel on board,
       location, fuel remaining, ETA, landing runway, wind and type of explosive or hazardous
       cargo.
       7.3.1.2. Suspend aircraft operations to Runway 16/34 (or aircraft operations to landing
       zones operations as applicable).
       7.3.1.3. Contact FD, via their Crash Net, of pertinent emergency information, including a
       report when the emergency becomes the next aircraft to land.
       7.3.1.4. Notify Dyess Consolidated CP and/or SOF of any potential situation that may
       jeopardize the safety of other aircraft as a result of an arriving emergency aircraft (time
       permitting).
       7.3.1.5. Provide AMOPS immediate access to the runway for after-landing FOD/safety
       check.
       7.3.1.6. Resume aircraft operations to Runway 16/34 upon completion of the runway
       check/concurrence by AMOPS.
   7.3.2. AMOPS Responsibilities:
       7.3.2.1. Activate the SCN and relay information passed from the PCAS. In the event of
       an SCN outage, AMOPS will activate the SCN back-up procedures by initiating a
       conference call via the Siemens System Telephone Console. The Dyess Consolidated CP
       can also relay emergency information for AMOPS.
       7.3.2.2. Suspend runway operations once the aircraft has landed.
       7.3.2.3. Position the AMOPS vehicle at the approach end of the runway in use and
       request tower approval for runway access after emergency aircraft arrives.
       7.3.2.4. Resume runway operations upon completion of runway check if conditions are
       safe.
   7.3.3. Incident Commander (IC) Responsibilities:
       7.3.3.1. Act as the first official in response to any on or off base aircraft emergencies. If
       recovery operations (i.e., towing) are required, the crash recovery supervisor will be in
       charge of the ground operations. NOTE: The IC is usually the Senior Fire Official (SFO)
       responsible for the ground response to an aircraft emergency until the emergency is
       terminated, or it is safe for the crash recovery crew to take charge of the aircraft. The IC
       directs the EOC to support the Installation Control Center (ICC).
7.4. Dedicated Emergency Frequency. The dedicated emergency frequency is UHF 339.7.
The guidance for the dedicated emergency frequency is listed in the 7th Operations Group,
317th Airlift Group, 7th Mission Support Group Discrete Aircraft Emergency Frequency
Procedures LOA.
7.5. External Stores Jettison Area Procedures. These procedures are developed to provide
safe areas for jettison of stores (hazardous cargo, nonexpendable training munitions) or other
equipment aboard aircraft in distress. The procedures apply to all aircraft in the vicinity of
Dyess AFB or in contact with Dyess Tower, which have declared an emergency and have a
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              51


jettison requirement. Aircrew will jettison IAW procedures outlined in the Flight Manual or 11N
series technical orders for the type aircraft and stores involved.
   7.5.1. Designation of Jettison Area. The Marrion DZ on the extreme west side of Dyess
   AFB is designated as the primary jettison area. It is also designated as the primary salvo area
   for equipment para-drops from tactical airlift aircraft. All stores and equipment, internal and
   external, will be jettisoned over this area.
   7.5.2. Prior to jettison, the aircrew will inform Dyess Tower of the type of stores to be
   jettisoned.
   7.5.3. Dyess Tower will relay jettison information by activating the PCAS.
   7.5.4. AMOPS will relay jettison information over the SCN and notify the following: AFM,
   Weapons Safety, Marrion Tower, Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (if stores other
   than munitions are to be jettisoned) and 7 SFS Law Enforcement (LE) Desk (when jettison
   becomes certain).
   7.5.5. VFR Jettison Procedures (Day or Night).
       7.5.5.1. Dyess Tower Responsibilities:
          7.5.5.1.1. Make a visual check of the jettison area and NAVAID sites, for any
          personnel, vehicle or equipment. If any are sighted, attempt to delay the jettison and
          take action to have the area evacuated by advising Marrion Tower or AMOPS
          personnel.
          7.5.5.1.2. Advise all aircraft in the local area to remain clear of the traffic pattern
          until further advised.
          7.5.5.1.3. Determine if the aircrew intends to request radar vectors to the drop
          point. If so, instruct aircrew to contact ABI Approach. ABI Approach will vector
          VFR aircraft only IAW FAAO JO 7110.65.
          7.5.5.1.4. Describe the jettison area to the aircrew as a 175 degree magnetic course
          from the north overrun of Runway 16/34 at a minimum altitude of 3,000’ MSL.
          Jettison will be made abeam Taxiway Charlie in order for stores to land in jettison
          area.
          7.5.5.1.5. If the stores are not jettisoned on the first pass, instruct the aircrew to
          proceed on a 160 degree heading for at least 4 NM. The aircrew may then maneuver
          for another jettison attempt, exercising caution to avoid over flying populated areas.
   7.5.6. IFR Jettison Procedures (Day or Night).
       7.5.6.1. Dyess Tower Responsibilities:
          7.5.6.1.1. Make a visual check of jettison area and NAVAID sites for any personnel,
          vehicle or equipment. If any are sighted, attempt to delay the jettison and take action
          to have the area evacuated by advising Marrion Tower or AMOPS.
          7.5.6.1.2. Coordinate approach and jettison with ABI Approach for radar-assisted
          jettison.
 52                                                DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


          7.5.6.1.3. Additional Procedures for Radar Outage. If requested, ATC will describe
          the jettison area to the aircrew as “track outbound from the ABI VORTAC on the 166
          DEGREE radial at a minimum altitude of 3,000’ MSL and jettison at a point 4
          NAUTICAL miles from the ABI VORTAC.” Aircraft will track outbound on the 166
          degree radial and climb to 4,000’ MSL, and then contact the ABI Approach for
          further instructions. NOTE: To prevent confusion, Dyess Tower will stress the use
          of the ABI VORTAC and not the DYS TACAN.
          7.5.6.1.4. The aircrew will keep Dyess Tower informed of position and jettison status
          until ABI Approach assumes control.
   7.5.7. Other Jettison Procedures.
       7.5.7.1. Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) personnel and equipment will establish positions from
       where they can proceed to the impact point with minimum delay when jettisoned stores
       are of an explosive or flammable nature. These positions will not be closer to the
       Marrion area than the western edge of the parking ramp, but not including Taxilane
       Alpha.
       7.5.7.2. Dyess aircrew members can familiarize themselves with the appearance of the
       drop zone on the radarscope if their aircraft are so equipped. This action can be
       performed during VFR conditions with practice approaches and to assist the AC in
       determining the jettison point.
7.6. Fuel Dumping. If emergency fuel dumping is required, the aircrew will inform Dyess
Consolidated CP and the ATC controlling agency of position, time, altitude, heading, and
amount of fuel to be dumped.
   7.6.1. The 7 BW/317 AG emergency fuel dump area is located between 30 thru 80 DME
   while established on the ABI VORTAC 220 degree radial (Attachment 3). Altitudes are
   from 10,000’ MSL to FL 200.
   7.6.2. Aircrew, however, retain the prerogative to dump fuel elsewhere in cases where
   expeditious action to adjust aircraft gross weight is required in the interest of safety.
7.7. Abandonment of Aircraft. The PCAS will be activated for an aircraft bail-out/crash.
   7.7.1. Controlled Bailout. When an aircraft is preparing to crash off/on base, Dyess Tower
   will obtain position/heading from ABI Approach and request that the aircrew squawk the
   emergency IFF/SIF code (7700). If aircrew determines an abandonment of aircraft is
   necessary, controllers will describe the bailout area as “165 DEGREE MAGNETIC COURSE
   FROM THE ABILENE VORTAC.” Aircrew will accomplish a controlled bailout over the
   north end of Dyess’ Runway 16/34.
   7.7.2. Ejection. Aircrew will determine the need to eject from their aircraft.
   7.7.3. Plotting Aircraft Coordinates. After receiving the location of the abandoned aircraft
   from FD or other designated agency (e.g., Dyess Consolidated CP) Dyess Tower will plot
   and broadcast aircraft coordinates over the PCAS and AMOPS will ring out SCN with that
   information.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            53


7.8. Lost Communications Procedures. These procedures will be utilized to alert Dyess
Tower and complete a landing at Dyess when primary radio communications are lost. At this
point, the aircraft will be considered No Radio (NORDO).
   7.8.1. Aircrew will make every effort to contact Dyess Tower or ABI Approach through use
   of secondary radios. VOR receivers will be tuned to emergency frequency 121.5 for receipt
   of instructions unless needed for navigation purposes. Squawk IFF/SIF Mode 3, code
   7600/7700 as appropriate. If communications cannot be established with any ATC agency
   and landing must be accomplished, the following procedures will apply:
   7.8.2. IFR. Aircrew will follow “Two Way Radio Failure Procedures” outlined in the FLIPs.
   7.8.3. VFR. Aircrew will overfly the airfield no less than 4,500’ MSL to determine the
   landing direction by observing other aircraft departures/landings or one of the airfield wind
   socks.
      7.8.3.1. Aircrew will enter and fly a normal traffic pattern up to final approach. After
      completing the final approach turn, fly a course parallel to the runway at a minimum
      altitude of 3,000’ MSL.
      7.8.3.2. Aircrew will rock the aircraft wings at approximately 1 NM prior to reaching a
      point abeam the tower. Aircrew will continue to rock the aircraft wings until Dyess
      Tower acknowledges the loss of communications via standard light gun signals. Aircraft
      landing lights should be flashed to alert Dyess Tower at night.
      7.8.3.3. Dyess Tower will transmit landing instructions utilizing emergency and guard
      frequencies simultaneously in addition to transmitting on standard tower
      frequencies. Dyess Tower will flash light gun signals to the aircraft to issue proper
      landing instructions.

7.9. Visual Check of Landing Gear. In the event an aircraft experiences a landing gear
malfunction of any type, a tower flyby may be executed, weather permitting, to allow
observation of the aircraft. All gear malfunctions resulting in emergencies will be reported over
the PCAS. The SOF or an instructor pilot qualified in the type aircraft experiencing difficulty
may be dispatched to Dyess Tower. The Dyess Tower controller will transmit any information
the SOF or instructor pilot desires and will identify the source.
   7.9.1. The flyby will normally be made at 300’ AGL (2,100’ MSL) and midway between the
   main ramp and the runway in the direction of normal traffic.
   7.9.2. After determination has been made, tower controllers will transmit to the aircraft, the
   apparent status of the landing gear.
7.10. Overdue or Missing Aircraft. An aircraft is overdue when it has failed to arrive within
30 minutes of ETA and communications with, or location of the aircraft cannot be
established. An aircraft is considered missing when its location cannot be determined after an
extended communications search.
   7.10.1. For overdue aircraft, AMOPS will request assistance in locating a missing aircraft
   from Dyess Tower, ABI Approach, Fort Worth ARTCC, Dyess Consolidated CP, TA,
   aircraft flying squadron (if known), and transmit a message over the Aeronautical
   Information System Replacement (AISR). Agencies will notify AMOPS whether the aircraft
   has been located or not.
   7.10.2. If AMOPS is unable to locate the missing aircraft, they will initiate an extended
   communications search by requesting assistance from Fort Worth Flight Service Station
   (FSS) and AF Rescue Coordination Center.
7.11. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs).
   7.11.1. ELT tests may be conducted during the first 5 minutes after each hour for three
   audible sweeps. If tower detects continuous ELT signals outside of the 5-minute window,
   Dyess Tower will notify AMOPS and Ft Worth ARTCC. AMOPS will notify Dyess
   Consolidated CP.
   7.11.2. AMOPS will advise TA if transient aircraft are on the ramp to check for an ELT. In
   the absence of TA services, AMOPS will contact transient aircrew to conduct a check of their
   aircraft. AMOPS will then notify Dyess Tower whether or not the source has been found.
   7.11.3. Dyess Consolidated CP will contact 7 BW MOC, 317 AG MOC and Aircrew Flight
   Equipment (AFE) elements to check for a possible source in an aircraft or other areas. Dyess
   Consolidated CP will then contact AMOPS and Dyess Tower whether or not the source is
   found.
   7.11.4. Dyess Tower will not activate the PCAS unless the ELT resulted from an aircraft
   mishap in the local area or aircrew ejecting from an aircraft in the local area.
7.12. Aborted Takeoff Procedures. Aircrews will state intentions to Dyess Tower in the event
of aborted takeoff as soon as practical. Aircrews will clear the runway at the first available,
suitable taxiway, Dash 1 procedures permitting. Aircrews will inform Dyess Tower of reason for
abort and request assistance as necessary. Aircrew will then contact Dyess Ground when clear of
the runway. Aircrew will coordinate with the SOF for further actions.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                55


7.13. Emergency Arresting/Barrier Gear Procedures. Dyess AFB does not have arresting
gear/barriers; therefore, procedures for these operations do not exist.
7.14. Jettison of Drag Chutes. Aircrew will state intentions to Dyess Tower prior to the
jettison of drag chutes, time permitting. Dyess Tower will advise the aircrew that chute-packing
capabilities are not available. Dyess Tower will contact AMOPS to coordinate the retrieval of
the drag chute. When TA is unavailable AMOPS will notify 7BW/MOC (ext. 1959) of the
possible drag chute jettison.
   7.14.1. Approach and drag chutes used for landing will be jettisoned on Taxiways Bravo or
   Foxtrot as appropriate. Dyess Tower will notify AMOPS when a drag chute has been
   jettisoned.
   7.14.2. AMOPS will notify TA or 7 MOS MOC to retrieve the drag chute. 7 MOS MOC
   will direct recovery of drag chutes during the hours of TA non-availability.
7.15. Hot Brake Area and Procedures.
   7.15.1. Dyess Tower will direct landing aircraft with suspected or actual hot brakes to the
   hammerhead taxiways at the end of the landing runway.
   7.15.2. Aircraft with hot brakes anywhere on the airfield other than the runway will
   immediately notify Dyess Ground and hold their position. Aircraft will not taxi past or near
   aircraft with hot brakes.
   7.15.3. The alternative “HOT BRAKE” area for LZ 162/342 and LZ 162/342 are Taxiways
   Juliet and Hotel.
7.16. Hung Ordinance Procedures. Hung ordnance is any failed attempt to fire or release
ordnance, or any known or suspected gun malfunction. The PCAS will be activated for hung
ordnance/hot guns.
   7.16.1. Aircraft with hung ordnance (including forward firing) can expect radar vectors away
   from heavily populated areas and will avoid over-flying populated areas. If radar vectors are
   not available, aircraft can expect alternate instructions or clearance. Aircraft will conduct a
   straight-in full stop landing. NOTE: Aircraft will not fly Dyess VFR patterns with hung
   ordnance.
   7.16.2. Dyess Tower will direct all aircraft with hung ordnance/hot guns to hold at the
   arm/dearm areas at Taxiways Bravo or Foxtrot. Dyess Tower will also direct aircraft with
   hung ordnance/hot guns to point the aircraft with the ordinance/guns facing approximately
   230 degrees Southwest, until stores can be assured of being in a safe condition before
   proceeding to the parking/download areas (Attachment 2).
   7.16.3. If stores are determined to be in an unsafe condition, aircraft will have its parking
   brakes set, aircraft shutdown, and evacuated until EOD can safe the munitions.
7.17. Anti-hijack/Unauthorized Aircraft Movement. Dyess Tower will activate the PCAS
and relay all available information in the event of an unscheduled aircraft engine start that cannot
be verified, an aircraft taxiing without prior permission from Dyess Tower, or notification that a
hijacked aircraft has or is expected to land at Dyess AFB. Aircraft anti-theft/anti-hijacking is
covered in detail in the 7th Bomb Wing OPLAN 510-XX, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking).

7.18. Wind Limitations on Control Tower. The 7 OG/CC determines the continued need for
ATC services when winds reach up to 55 knots. When the wind velocity exceeds 65 knots (75
mph), Dyess Tower will be evacuated. The Base Civil Engineer has determined that the tower
structure is safe up to a wind speed of 80 knots.
7.19. Evacuation of ATC Facility.
   7.19.1. The Dyess Tower WS/SC will direct evacuation of the tower when:
      7.19.1.1. A tornado is within 10 miles and moving toward the base.
      7.19.1.2. Wind speeds exceed 65 knots (75 mph).
      7.19.1.3. Any natural or manmade disaster or equipment failure renders Dyess Tower
      unusable.
      7.19.1.4. Any other condition (bomb threat, fires, etc.) that could endanger personnel.
   7.19.2. In the event of actual or simulated tower evacuation, the following procedures apply
   (time permitting):
      7.19.2.1. Dyess Tower Responsibilities:
          7.19.2.1.1. Activate the PCAS, advise agencies that the tower is being evacuated and
          state the reason. AMOPS will activate the SCN.
          7.19.2.1.2. Notify ABI Approach of facility evacuation.
          7.19.2.1.3. Broadcast twice on all frequencies that the tower is being evacuated.
          7.19.2.1.4. Direct airborne aircraft to contact ABI Approach.
          7.19.2.1.5. Direct taxiing aircraft to hold their position and contact Dyess
          Consolidated CP for instructions.
          7.19.2.1.6. AMOPS will NOTAM close the airfield until Dyess Tower services are
          resumed.
          7.19.2.1.7. Broadcast an advisory on the ATIS advisory, time permitting.
   7.19.3. Time permitting tower personnel will evacuate to 317 AG auditorium (Bldg 4216),
   unless otherwise directed. If time does not permit, personnel will proceed to the 4th floor or
   ground floor of the tower. The 317 AG shall provide the cipher lock code for Bldg 4216 to
   the Dyess Tower Chief Controller upon request.
   7.19.4. When Dyess Tower has been evacuated, runway operations are ceased. Routine
   engine ground operation and towing operations will cease.
   7.19.5. Tower Re-Opening Procedures. Dyess Tower WS/SCs will make a determination
   when to resume operations in the ATC facilities after coordination with appropriate agencies.
   Dyess Tower will complete equipment checklists.
      7.19.5.1. AMOPS shall activate SCN to announce tower’s relocation to Dyess Tower.
      7.19.5.2. Dyess Tower will request that CE inspect the tower for possible structural
      damage following severe weather/high wind evacuation or as required.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                           57


7.20. Alternate ATC Facility Procedures. The 7 OG/CC has determined the need for an
alternate ATC facility does not exist.
7.21. Evacuation of AMOPS Facility. Evacuation will be accomplished when notified to
evacuate the building or conditions dictate an evacuation (fire, bomb threat, toxic corridor).
   7.21.1. AMOPS Responsibilities:
       7.21.1.1. Notify Dyess Tower (Hotline, DSN 461-3713, or DSN 461-1400).
       7.21.1.2. Activate the SCN and disseminate: “AMOPS and Weather personnel are
       evacuating. AMOPS will be on the Ramp Net until set up at the alternate location."
       7.21.1.3. Notify Ft Worth ARTCC, time permitting.
       7.21.1.4. Notify building personnel to evacuate the building.
7.22. Alternate AMOPS Facility Procedures. The alternate AMOPS facility is the Air Traffic
Control Tower, Bldg 4300. NOTE: The WF will also be relocating to the same locations as
AMOPS personnel.

                           FLIGHT PLANNING PROCEDURES

8.1. Flight Planning. A signed IFR or VFR flight plan is mandatory for all aircraft departing
Dyess AFB. Base-assigned aircrew shall not depart until a flight plan (FP) is e-filed with local
flying squadrons to include local training flights. AMOPS maintains the following Letter of
Agreements to facilitate Dyess’ aircrew flight planning process and outline AMOPS, Dyess
Tower, Squadron Operations’ desks and aircrew responsibilities: 7 OSS and 39 AS / 40 AS Letter
of Agreement for Electronic Flight Planning; 7 OSS and 9 BS Letter of Agreement for Electronic
Flight Planning; 7 OSS and 28 BS Letter of Agreement for Electronic Flight Planning; 7 OSS
and 77 WPS Letter of Agreement for Electronic Flight Planning; 7 OSS and 337 TES Letter of
Agreement for Electronic Flight Planning.
   8.1.1. AMOPS is responsible for flight-following and inputting all flight plans for transient
   aircraft departing Dyess AFB as required. AMOPS will initiate any necessary aircraft search
   and rescue procedures. AMOPS will also initiate any necessary aircraft security and anti-
   hijacking procedures. If there is any flight planning equipment outages, AMOPS will report
   and coordinate the appropriate repairs. In the event of communications outages or issues
   precluding the normal input of flight plans, AMOPS will contact Altus AFB for assistance
   IAW 7 OSS/OSAA Memorandum of Agreement with 97 OSS/OSAA, Altus AFB. NOTE:
   Non-base assigned aircraft must obtain Prior Permission Required (PPR) numbers from
   AMOPS prior to filing a flight plan with Dyess as a destination. In the event a non-base
   assigned aircraft lands at Dyess without a PPR or for non-emergency reasons, the aircrews
   must complete a PPR violation form.
   8.1.2. Dyess Tower is responsible for producing and reporting traffic count data as required.
   8.1.3. Transient Aircrews. Flights originating at Dyess AFB with a local or CONUS route
   will use DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan. Military international flights will use DD Form
   1801, DoD International Flight Plan. DD Form 175s will be submitted at least 1 hour prior
   to departure time. DD Form 1801s will be submitted at least 2 hours prior to departure time.
   When possible, DD Form 1801s will be submitted 24 hours in advance to ensure any
   problems are resolved in a timely manner. Flight plans will include an authorized signature
   in the approving authority block. Incomplete flight plans will not be processed until all
   required information is provided. IFR flight plans will be automatically closed upon landing.
8.2. Prior Permission Requested (PPR) Procedures. PPR numbers are issued to transient
aircrews requesting to transition Dyess AFB when Dyess is under operational restrictions
published by NOTAM. PPR numbers are not to be given out earlier than 7 days prior to the
proposed date, or later than 24 hours prior to the proposed date.
   8.2.1. AMOPS is responsible for contacting TA to verify parking and TA’s services (when
   an aircrew contacts AMOPS during duty hours requesting a PPR number). AMOPS will
   complete the PPR log for the day the transient crew wishes to fly into Dyess. PPR numbers
   consist of the date, chronological number and the issuer's initials, ex: 12-001-ST, 15-004-
   MP. AMOPS will complete appropriate checklist on all transient aircraft requiring support
   from base agencies. AMOPS will also coordinate transportation for transient aircrew when
   requested.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              59


   8.2.2. If an aircrew cancels their flight, AMOPS will contact TA and any other involved
   agencies. NOTE: Aircrews violating an airfield restriction (PPR/OBO/Quiet Hours) shall
   complete a PPR Violation form. Official Business Only (OBO) indicates the airfield is
   closed to all transient military aircraft for obtaining routine services such as fueling,
   passenger drop off or pickup, practice approaches, parking, etc. For further guidance on PPR
   and OBO, please refer to IFR Supplement.
8.3. Aircraft Arrival without a PPR. Dyess Tower will not deny landing clearance to aircraft
solely because there is no PPR on file. Circumstances that are unknown to Dyess Tower or
AMOPS may necessitate the aircraft landing.
   8.3.1. Dyess Tower will instruct aircraft arriving without a PPR to contact AMOPS on PTD
   frequency or landline, time permitting. AMOPS will determine the aircraft’s status and
   parking location and notify Dyess Tower. If coordination has not been completed prior to the
   aircraft landing, tower will instruct the aircraft to hold on Taxiways Bravo or Foxtrot until
   necessary coordination is complete. If the aircraft is carrying hazardous cargo or munitions,
   Dyess Tower will instruct the aircraft to keep engines running until its final parking location
   has been determined.
   8.3.2. If the unannounced aircraft is civilian, the aircraft will be held on Taxiway Bravo or
   Taxiway Foxtrot until SFS can determine the situation is non-hostile. TA will provide
   follow-me service to the transient ramp. AMOPS will initiate actions IAW AFI 10-1001.
   NOTE: Aircraft that file as a flight and subsequently break off from the flight, using a
   separate call sign, are considered by Dyess Tower to have a valid flight plan on file as long
   as they have filed individual forms with the original flight plan. EXAMPLE: HAZRD 10, a
   flight of three C-130s, breaks up into HAZRD 10, HAZRD 11, and HAZRD 12. If four
   flight plan forms were filed, all aircraft are considered to have a flight plan after break off
   and may be given local clearances and/or taxi-backs.
8.4. NOTAM Procedures. NOTAM Procedures. Dyess Tower is the primary NOTAM
monitoring facility for all Dyess ATCALS issues. AMOPS is the secondary monitoring facility.
AMOPS is responsible for disseminating all NOTAM information. HQ ACC/A3AO is the
Series V NOTAM authority and issues NOTAMS that affect instrument procedures at Dyess.
   8.4.1. Agencies responsible for maintenance or construction near airfield pavements,
   lighting, or NAVAIDs shall coordinate such activities with the AFM who will inform
   AMOPS to disseminate NOTAMs/LNOTAMs.
   8.4.2. Dyess Tower shall report all NAVAID malfunctions, outages and restorations to
   AMOPS, 7 CS/SCOA and ABI Approach. NOTE: Dyess AFB NOTAM procedures
   supplement AFI 13-204 Vol 3 and AFI (I) 11-208, Department of Defense Notice to Airmen
   (NOTAM) System.
8.5. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Accounts, Procedures for Requesting Changes.
   8.5.1. Current FLIP information is essential for flight planning and flight safety. Therefore,
   it is vital that personnel are aware of requisition/order procedures. The Primary or Alternate
   AMOPS FLIP Monitors are responsible for the ordering or requisitioning of FLIP for base
   assigned units not having their own National Geospatial Agency (NGA) account.
60                                             DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


  8.5.2. Each agency/unit that is a subaccount holder requiring FLIP will submit their
  requirements in writing to 7 OSS/OSAA. Any unit that exceeds the DOD FLIP Basis of
  Distribution as outlined in the NGA Catalog of Maps, Charts and Related Products, Section
  4, must justify all excess IAW NGA Catalog. FLIP Sub-account Holders are required to
  revalidate their requirements annually.
  8.5.3. FLIP Web Pages: Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) www.fcg.pentagon.mil; NGA
  http://www.nima.mil/portal/site/nga01/  and   FAA    Advisory  Circulars   (AC)
  http://www.faa.gov.
  8.5.4. AMOPS FLIP Monitor will contact agencies on the distribution listing and annotate
  date and time contacted; the preferred method is through email. Publications not picked up
  seven days after the second notification shall go back to stock.
  8.5.5. AMOPS FLIP Monitor prepares and coordinates non-procedural FLIP changes with
  appropriate local agencies before submitting IAW General Planning, Chapter 11. The AFM
  approves non-procedural FLIP change requests. AMOPS initiates NOTAM action for non-
  procedural FLIP changes, as necessary. HQ ACC/A3AO monitors, prepares and coordinates
  procedural FLIP changes with appropriate local agencies before submitting. HQ ACC/A3AO
  initiates NOTAM action for procedural FLIP changes, as necessary.
  8.5.6. AMOPS FLIP Monitor ensures currency of airfield restriction data when published in
  the AMC Airfield Suitability Restrictions Report (ASRR) and coordinates changes when
  required with GQ AMC/A3AS. 7 OG/OGV and 317 AG/AGV will review airfield
  restrictions that will be placed in the ASRR prior to submitting to GQ AMC/A3AS.

9.4. Distinguished Visitor Notification Procedures. DV aircraft will be afforded priority as
much as possible during aircraft arrival/departure.
   9.4.1. IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3, Tower notifies AMOPS only once about the location of the
   DV arrivals. Specifically, Dyess Tower will make a “15 miles to fly” notification call to
   AMOPS. This duty is secondary to providing ATC services.
   9.4.2. AMOPS will provide Dyess Tower and Dyess Consolidated CP a daily list of all
   known DV arrivals for Code 6 or higher. In turn, Dyess Consolidated CP will advise
   AMOPS of any known DV details. AMOPS will state "DV on board" when passing the
   flight plan to Dyess Tower.
9.5. Civil Aircraft Operations/Authorized Landings. Civil aircraft operations at Dyess AFB
will be conducted IAW AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits. The 7 BW/CC has
delegated the authority for the processing and approving of landing permits to the AFM and
DAFM (or their designated AMOPS representative in the absences of the AFM and DAFM).
For events other than the Dyess Open House, the AFM and DAFM will up-channel the status of
pending landing permits to the AOF/CC. In turn, the AOF/CC will notify the 7 OSS/CC.
9.6. Unauthorized Civil Aircraft Arrivals. The procedures for unauthorized civil aircraft
arrivals/landings (unauthorized aircraft movement) are detailed in the 7th Bomb Wing OPLAN
510-XX. The AFM will process civil aircraft landing permits IAW AFI 10-1001.
9.7. Base Exercises. All exercise scenarios that involve the AO personnel, airfield, CMA or
any ATC facilities shall be coordinated with AMOPS and ATC Exercise Evaluation Team (EET)
representatives. The AOF/CC and AFM must be briefed at least 48 hours in advance of exercise
start. Minimum information required includes the time of exercise, affected airfield area,
facilities to include ATCALS and their degree of involvement. The Dyess Tower WS/SC may
interrupt or discontinue tower’s participation in any exercise for safety reasons. The Dyess
Tower WS/SC must not wear a gas mask during facility operations while under simulated threat
conditions. The Dyess Tower WS/SC will direct controllers IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3 and AFI 13-
204 Vol 3 ACC Sup.
9.8. Fire Pit Operations. 7 CES/CEF, Fire Emergency Services, is the OPR for fire pit
operations/training. The pit is used only during periods of minimal or no flying. 7 CES/CEF

                    UNCONTROLLED AIRFIELD OPERATIONS (UAO)

10.1. Limitations
   10.1.1. Aircraft and Units. Operations conducted under the scope of this agreement have
   specific limitations. Only aircraft supported by, or assigned to, the 317 AG shall be
   authorized to operate under this instruction.
   10.1.2. Time. Although Dyess AFB has manning authorizations to support 24/7 hour
   operations IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3 ACC Sup Attachment 19, Dyess airfield hours of
   operation are published in the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement. Aircrew must use
   the IFR Supplement and view NOTAMs for mission planning purposes. UAO will take
   place during periods when the airfield is closed.
   10.1.3. Runway. UAO arrivals and departures will only be conducted to/from Runway
   16/34 when a qualified LZSO is unavailable/NOT on duty. Operations to/from LZ 16/34B
   are authorized, provided a qualified LZSO is on duty and has coordinated with the Fire
   Alarm Communications Center (FACC) for CFR support. A fire truck must be in place on
   the west side of the main runway prior to landing on or taking off from LZ 16/34B. The
   LZSO will request fire coverage through Dyess Consolidated CP.
   10.1.4. Weather. UAO can be flown to the lowest compatible approach minimums or VFR
   circling minimums for sidestep approaches to LZ 16B. Circling to LZ 34B is authorized for
   day VFR operations only.
   10.1.5. Pattern Restrictions. UAO shall be limited to a single departure/arrival for each
   aircraft. Practice aircraft approaches and pattern work are prohibited. Aircrews must depart
   the aerodrome following initial takeoff unless experiencing a situation that requires an
   immediate landing.
   10.1.6. Airfield Maintenance. 317 AG shall ensure operations at the airfield are de-
   conflicted with scheduled PMs of various navigational/airfield equipment and airfield
   construction projects. ATCALS MP schedules are published in the FLIPs and/or NOTAMs.
   If a situation arises where UAO will impact airfield systems/lighting maintenance, 317
   OSS/OSO will coordinate with 7 OSS/OSA and the unit conducting maintenance to attempt
   and resolve the issue. If both 317 OSS/OSO and the unit conducting maintenance deem safe,
   UAO and maintenance may occur simultaneously. If no resolution is possible, the
   maintenance operation will have priority. 7 CES will notify Dyess Consolidated CP of no-
   notice or unscheduled after hours airfield maintenance during times of projected UAO.
10.2. Procedures/Responsibilities
   10.2.1. Scheduling. UAO will be scheduled on the 317 AG’s Group Operations Plan (GOP)
   and coordinated with the 7 BW at the Pre-165 meeting each week to the max extent possible.
   At a minimum, the assigned ODO will complete the UAO Setup checklist (Attachment 9) the
   duty day prior to requested operations. If UAO will occur on multiple days, coordination
   must be accomplished for each individual day.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                             65


  10.2.2. ODO Procedures and Responsibilities. The Operations Duty Officer (ODO), call
  sign “ODO 1”, is the focal point for operations conducted under the scope of this instruction
  and will be designated by 317 AG/CC and tasked by 317 OSS/OSO. In supervising the UAO,
  the ODO operates in lieu of Dyess Tower and AMOPS to ensure operations are conducted
  safely, airfield security is not compromised and that emergency response is available as
  required. ODOs who are also qualified as LZSOs may function in both capacities to
  facilitate LZ operations. During the day of UAOs, the ODO will execute the checklist found
  in Attachment 11.
     10.2.2.1. The ODO shall not act as an Air Traffic Control (ATC) function, but may
     relay aircraft advisories (NOT ATC instructions) via Dyess Consolidated CP. For
     aircraft arrivals, the ODO will be on duty 1 hour prior to scheduled arrival and will
     remain on duty until the aircraft is parked and the engines are shut down. For departures,
     the ODO will be on duty from 1 hour prior to departure and stay 30 minutes after takeoff.
     10.2.2.2. Prior Coordination: The ODO shall obtain an in-person SOF briefing from the
     AFM or their designated representative prior to commencing UAO. This briefing shall
     be the last checklist item completed and will address the status of all airfield facilities,
     NOTAMs, construction avoidance areas and planned airfield maintenance activities
     during the period of UAO. Once the checklist is complete, a copy of the checklist will be
     given to the AOF/CC or their designated representative for final approval. When the
     ODO contacts 7 CS/SCOA, they will ensure that there is no maintenance or MPs
     scheduled that are outside of what is published in the FLIP. If an irreconcilable conflict
     exists, maintenance operations will have priority.
     10.2.2.3. 317 OSS/OSO (or ODO) will ensure that Dyess Consolidated CP is notified
     and aware of upcoming UAO. NOTE: If the full setup checklist is not accomplished,
     the UAO will not take place.
     10.2.2.4. Prior to any aircraft movement, the ODO shall perform an airfield check on all
     taxi routes and the runway to be utilized by their aircraft to ensure movement areas are
     free of FOD, wildlife, obstructions, etc.
     10.2.2.5. The ODO shall report any unauthorized aircraft/vehicles in the airfield
     environment to Dyess Consolidated CP and 7 SFS.
     10.2.2.6. The ODO will position himself on the airfield near the intended route of taxi
     for arriving/departing aircraft so as to allow quick and timely notification of airfield
     maintenance personnel that may present a conflict.
  10.2.3. AOF Responsibilities.
     10.2.3.1. AMOPS Responsibilities:
         10.2.3.1.1. Ensure appropriate FLIP contains statements that note the possibility of
         UAOs when Dyess AFB is published closed.
         10.2.3.1.2. Prior to commencing UAO, AMOPS will provide an in person briefing to
         the ODO on airfield status and sign the completed setup checklist. They will also
         maintain a copy of the setup checklist for a period of 30 days following completion of
         UAO.
         10.2.3.1.3. AMOPS will maintain procedures for airfield driving during UAOs.

     during UAO:
         10.2.7.1.1. GOV for airfield driving.
         10.2.7.1.2. UHF radio to include spare batteries or automotive adapter.
         10.2.7.1.3. Portable LMR (Ramp Net) to include spare batteries and/or charger.
     10.2.7.2. Act as the overall OPR for UAO and will maintain a continuity binder which
     includes all applicable unit/base directives and ODO checklists and procedures.
     10.2.7.3. Disseminate scheduled UAO on the “317th Flying Windows” slide to both 7
     OSS/Airfield Operations Supervisors and Dyess Consolidated CP.
     10.2.7.4. Ensure the list of approved ODOs is provided to 7 OSS/Airfield Operations
     Supervisors.
     10.2.7.5. Coordinate with 7 OSS/Airfield Operations Supervisors before scheduling
     UAO to ensure after-hours/unscheduled maintenance will not be a conflict.
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              67


     10.2.7.6. To the best extent possible, de-conflict routine airfield maintenance through 7
     OSS/Airfield Operations Supervisors for the coordinated UAO. Interrupting coordinated
     UAO requires 7 OG/CC approval.
  10.2.8. Flight Procedures.
     10.2.8.1. Aircraft safety is ultimately the responsibility of the aircraft commander.
     Aircrews participating in UAO will use normal procedures for uncontrolled operations
     IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 3.
         10.2.8.1.1. Aircrews must annotate “UAO” in the remarks section of the flight plan.
         10.2.8.1.2. Flight plans will be retained by the originating unit. The ODO can assist
         the aircrew by electronically filing the flight plans through the AISR website and
         activate and close flight plans with Abilene Flight Service Station (FSS) or other
         applicable facility. Units will maintain the original flight plan on file for a period of
         180 days for reference.
     10.2.8.2. Aircrews will obtain an IFR clearance via phone with FSS for expected
     departure time or with ATC via radio. Aircrews arriving during UAO will cancel their
     IFR flight plan with ATC when visual with the airfield or upon landing. NOTE: IFR
     clearances will typically include a “valid at” and “cancelled if not airborne by” for a
     specific time after the clearance is issued.
     10.2.8.3. Step Briefing. The ODO shall contact Dyess Consolidated CP with any
     airfield, taxi, departure and landing restrictions applicable to UAO. It is the
     responsibility of the aircrews to contact the ODO and receive a step briefing prior to
     departing, and should contact Dyess Consolidated CP 30 minutes out to receive an
     airfield update from the ODO.            This does not relieve the aircrews planning
     responsibilities outlined in AFI 11-2C-130JV3, such as checking weather, NOTAMS,
     ensuring a flight plan is filed and closed, etc.
     10.2.8.4. Taxi Routes. Aircrews shall taxi via the most direct route to and from the
     runway consistent with safety and taxi restrictions. All taxi operations shall be
     accomplished using overt lighting. Aircrews will give right of way to all emergency
     vehicles and avoid the B-1 Bravo rows to the highest extent possible.
     10.2.8.5. Runways. Operations shall be conducted on Runway 16/34 or LZ 16/34B.
     10.2.8.6. Pattern Procedures.    Aircrews should adhere to recommended pattern
     procedures for UAO as described in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and
     other related FAA regulations. Aircrews will observe Dyess AFB local traffic patterns.
     10.2.8.7. In order to ensure de-confliction with ABI Airport, which is within 10 NM of
     Dyess AFB, aircrews will avoid the eastern sector of Dyess Class C. Exception: The
     standard traffic pattern for Runway 16/34 is allowed.
     10.2.8.8. Altimeter Setting.     Aircrews shall obtain an altimeter setting from ABI
     Approach.
     10.2.8.9. If aircrews are operating under UAO during hours of darkness, the ODO will
     ensure the airfield lighting is turned on no more than 30 minutes prior to taxi and no less
     than 30 minutes prior to landing. The ODO will also ensure airfield lighting is turned off
68                                                 DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014


     no earlier than 30 minutes after departure and prior to terminating operations. NOTE:
     For nighttime operations, if airfield lighting is not turned on prior to landing, aircraft shall
     divert to ABI Airport or other airports as required until lighting is turned on.
     10.2.8.10. Commencement/Termination of Operations.         The ODO shall report
     commencement/termination of operations to Dyess Consolidated CP. In turn, Dyess
     Consolidated CP will notify FD and 7 SFS that UAO has been initiated/terminated.
  10.2.9. Communications Procedures.
     10.2.9.1. Radio Communications. Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) is
     Dyess AFB Air Traffic Control Tower frequency, 257.675. (257.675 is continuously
     recorded as an ATC frequency). NOTE: Utilizing VHF for the purpose of Dyess CTAF
     is not authorized. Departing aircrews shall establish radio contact with Dyess
     Consolidated CP before taxiing to the runway for departure. Arriving aircrews shall
     establish contact with Dyess Consolidated CP at least 10 minutes prior to landing. The
     ODO shall provide airfield advisories as appropriate. All communication between the
     ODO and the aircraft will be via Dyess Consolidated CP.
     10.2.9.2. The primary method for the ODO to communicate with vehicular traffic will be
     via LMR over Ramp Net. All vehicle operators that will be accessing the runway will
     have an operable LMR (Ramp Net), with the exception of FD who operates on their own
     separate FD frequency (Crash Net). This will ensure two way communications between
     the ODO and the vehicle operators. The ODO will monitor UHF and LMR radio at all
     times during UAO.
     10.2.9.3. If UAO is to occur 1 hour prior to the airfield opening or 1 hour after the
     airfield closes, all of the calls in Para 10.2.9.4 will also be made via Tower Net.
     10.2.9.4. At a minimum, the ODO will transmit the following via Ramp Net:
        10.2.9.4.1. Commencing operations (after contacting Dyess Consolidated CP)—
        “Attention on the Ramp Net, Uncontrolled Airfield Operations are commencing.”
        10.2.9.4.2. When aircrews call to taxi for departure—“Attention on the Ramp Net,
        aircraft taxiing to depart runway XX.”
        10.2.9.4.3. When aircrews call inbound—“Attention on the ramp net, aircraft XX
        minutes from Dyess, will be landing runway XX.”
        10.2.9.4.4. Terminating operations (prior to calling Dyess Consolidated CP)—
        “Attention on the ramp net, Uncontrolled Airfield Operations are terminated.”
     10.2.9.5. The ODO will contact the FACC at 696-2486 when UAO is commenced.
     When the UAO is terminated, the ODO will advise the FACC. If the ODO cannot
     establish direct contact with the FACC, the ODO will establish contact via Dyess
     Consolidated CP.
        10.2.9.5.1. In the event of an IFE, the ODO will contact the FACC via cell phone and
        give nature of emergency, Runway in use – 16/34, type of aircraft, number personnel
        on board and ETA. When an emergency has been declared, the ODO will switch to
        FD’s Crash Net. The SFO may contact the ODO for further information as needed.
        The ODO will remain silent on the Crash Net during emergency operations unless
DYESSAFBI11-250 29 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                               69


          called upon or has emergency traffic. If contact cannot be made via the FACC, the
          ODO will contact Dyess Consolidated CP to relay emergency information.
          10.2.9.5.2. For an IFE, the ODO will declare the emergency on Ramp Net and
          instruct all players to monitor Crash Net until the IFE is concluded.
   10.2.10. Emergency Procedures. The pilot in command or the ODO has the authority to
   declare an emergency at any time. In the event of an aircraft mishap or declared emergency,
   the ODO shall immediately notify FD with any pertinent information (i.e. current aircraft
   location and nature of emergency). The ODO will also notify Dyess Consolidated CP, who
   will implement the appropriate emergency procedures/checklists.
      10.2.10.1. The ODO will maintain control of the runway and airfield during aircraft
      emergencies and work with the SFO. The SFO will communicate with the ODO when
      access to the active runway is required for fire, emergency and maintenance vehicles.
      The SFO will have control of the emergency aircraft until the emergency is terminated.
   10.2.11. Vehicle Operations. See AFI 13-213 for UAO requirements.
   10.2.12. Alert Taskings.
      10.2.12.1. Departures – 317 OSS/OSO will assign an on-call ODO when tasked with
      alert missions that require UAO. The ODO will be alerted by Dyess Consolidated CP
      and will show with the alert aircrew. The on-call ODO will be annotated on the tasked
      squadron’s closure letter.
      10.2.12.2. Arrivals – Dyess Consolidated CP will alert the on-call ODO NLT 3 hours
      prior to ETA for alert missions arriving at KDYS during UAO. The ODO will be in
      place NLT 1 hour prior to land time. It is the responsibility of the aircraft commander to
      ensure CP is aware of updated and accurate arrival times.
      10.2.12.3. The ODO coordinates with 317 OSS/OSO to provide the aircrews with
      mission products and aids 317 OSS/OSO in accomplishing the Current Operations
      Aircrew Briefing Checklist.
      10.2.12.4. The ODO will not be tasked with additional taskings (EOC functions etc.)
      during the preparation for/execution of the UAO.
10.3. ODO Qualifications and Training
   10.3.1. Qualifications
      10.3.1.1. ODOs shall be knowledgeable of unit aircraft operations and have sound
      decision-making ability. All ODO appointments shall be via official memorandum by
