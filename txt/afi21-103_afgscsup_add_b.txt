This MESL complements AFI21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization
Reporting.    It establishes policy and assigns responsibility to provide UH-1N status
changes/updates in accordance with (IAW) current maintenance conditions and the developed
UH-1N mission essential subsystem list (MESL). This addendum applies to Air Force Global
Strike Command (AFGSC) and Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). This instruction does not apply to
the Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. This publication

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. This revision clarifies
policy and changes/adds information to the April 2010 edition. This revision has been
significantly reduced by using system work unit codes (combined specific WUCs into general
system WUCs). Added “At least one radar altimeter must be operational for night operations”
to qualifying note 8 in table 2. Added qualifying note to WUC 72C00 for day time operations
and updated the glossary of references and supporting information.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of system availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on a system for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test, or other missions.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using the respective MESL. Major
     Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
     MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the
     unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.3. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy FMC
     aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A Not Mission Capable
     (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be configured and
     generated to Mission Ready Available (MRA) status at an employment site.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems identified by Work
     Unit Code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List
     (BSL) across the page. If all systems or subsystems with an “X” in the FSL column are
     working, put the weapon system in a Full Mission Capable (FMC) status code. If any system
     or subsystem with an “X” in the FSL column only is not working, put the weapon system in a
     Partial Mission Capable (PMC) status code. Additionally, if any system or subsystem with
     an “X” in the FSL column and at least one, but not all, BSL columns is not working, put the
     weapon system in a PMC status code. If any system or subsystem with an “X” in the FSL
     and all BSL columns is not working, the weapon system cannot perform any mission thus put
     the weapon system in a Not Mission Capable (NMC) status code. The Mission Capable
     (MC) status is a combined status that includes both FMC and PMC hours.
2. UH-1N Helicopter MESL.
     2.1. MESL codes for the following AFGSC missions can be found in Table 2.1, UH-1N
     Mission Table 1: Emergency Security Response (ESR), Missile Security Support (MSS) and
     Direct Mission Support (DMS).
     2.2. MESL codes for the following PACAF missions can be found in Table 2.2, UH-1N
     Mission Table 2: Day VFR (Visual Flight Rules), Night IFR (Instrument Flight Rules), Cross
     Country, Pax MSN and Med Evac.
