                                           GENERAL

1.1. Objective. Guidance contained in Volume 1, 2, and 4 of this instruction series is written
exclusive of each other based upon the mission that is to be executed. Specifically, guidance
from one of these Volumes does not apply to any of the other Volumes. This instruction
prescribes basic guidance and approved procedures for planning, scheduling, controlling,
executing, and supporting airlift missions transporting DoD nuclear-related and other
Department of Energy (DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) cargo (other
than Category I and II Special Nuclear Material (SNM)).
1.2. Key Words Explained
   1.2.1. “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.2.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.2.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.2.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
   to emphasize.
1.3. Responsibilities. AMC, Nuclear Operations Division (AMC/A3N), is the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this instruction. Unless otherwise specified in cited source
references, AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the procedures unique to this publication and 18
AF/CC is the authority for specified mission planning and execution waivers.
1.4. Distribution. The following individuals and agencies associated with supporting or
executing nuclear airlift operations will maintain a copy of this instruction:
   1.4.1. Commanders of nuclear capable logistics units (PNAF/ Munitions Squadron (MUNS)/
   Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS)).
   1.4.2. Operations, logistics, and safety staff agencies.
   1.4.3. Security Forces units.
   1.4.4. Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) airlift squadron(s)/units.
   1.4.5. Each individual PNAF aircrew member.
   1.4.6. Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) for nuclear accounts.
   1.4.7. Custodial unit Civil Engineering, Readiness and Emergency Management, and
   Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units.
   1.4.8. Non-PNAF C-5, C-17, and C-130 crewmembers (authorized to maintain a copy, but
   only required to maintain a copy when tasked with executing a mission contained in this
   volume).
1.5. Protecting Classified Information.
   1.5.1. Use caution at all times to avoid compromising classified information. Adhere to all
   available classification guidance.
 6                                                                  AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


     1.5.2. AFI 16-610, Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG), the Air Force Nuclear
     Weapons Security Classification Policy, CG-W-5, Joint DOE/DoD Nuclear Weapon
     Classification Policy Guide, TCG-WPMU-2, Joint DOE/DoD Topical Classification Guide
     for Weapon Production and Military Use, Airlift Request, Economy Act, Mission Setup
     Message, and nuclear transportation technical orders govern the classification of nuclear
     mission information. Restricted data and formerly restricted data are not normally releasable
     to foreign nationals (NOFORN). Do not send this type of information to any agency (civilian
     or military) of a foreign government unless directed to do so by an authoritative publication
     such as the SWOG.
     1.5.3. Do not use terms in unclassified text that reveals nuclear or classified cargo is aboard
     a specific aircraft or mission or at a specific location.
     1.5.4. Do not talk around classified information. Use only the SAAM number, aircraft tail
     number, or Aircraft Commander’s name when discussing a particular mission in unclassified
     media or via open lines. Do not use the term “nuclear-related” or “DOE nuclear cargo” in
     conjunction with the SAAM number, aircraft tail number, or Aircraft Commander’s name.
     Do not associate line numbers with any of the shipping information that reveals actual
     nuclear cargo data (e.g., nuclear cargo or package name, net explosive weight (NEW),
     dimensions, or weight).
     1.5.5. Do not talk about any aspect of a DoD nuclear-related or other DOE SAAM unless the
     other person has an appropriate security clearance and a definite need-to-know. This applies
     even after a mission is complete.
     1.5.6. For specific guidance on classification of Special Nuclear Material, refer to DoDI O-
     5210.67, Special Nuclear Material Information, Security Classification Guidance.
1.6. Releasing Information. Only appropriate commanders and public affairs officers may
release information about nuclear mishaps to the public or news media. Public Affairs will
ensure timely and uniform implementation of DoD approved policies as referenced in DoDI
5400.13, Public Affairs Operations, and AFI 35-104, Media Operations, to establish and conduct
efficient and effective procedures for the release of nuclear activity information to the public,
including news media (domestic, international), to include nuclear operations, accidents, IND
incidents, or nuclear weapon significant incidents.
1.7. Logistics Movement of DoD Nuclear-Related and Other DOE/NNSA Cargo Airlift
Operations.
     1.7.1. DoD nuclear-related cargo and DOE/NNSA SNM will not be combined on the same
     mission.
     1.7.2. All DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo air movements will be by
     Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM). DoD nuclear-related items should be
     consolidated with established nuclear cargo SAAMs when possible. If unable, a SAAM
     equal to the appropriate priority will be established.
     1.7.3. The Copilot or other commissioned Active Duty officer may perform Courier duties
     described in this Volume, except when a Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) crew is
     required. PNAF aircrews will be used to airlift DoD nuclear-related cargo when required by
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                            7


   Attachment 2. PNAF crews will be used to airlift LLCs from CONUS to OCONUS locations
   (and vice versa).
      1.7.3.1. Once in theater, USAFE may airlift LLCs and other Type II cargo via non-
      PNAF crews and aircraft according to T.O. 11N-45-51, Transportation of Nuclear
      Materiel.
      1.7.3.2. USAFE is responsible for all coordination and planning requirements in this
      instruction for their in-theater DoD nuclear-related cargo air movements (i.e. de-conflict
      with PNAF missions, meeting delivery dates, mission planning, security, airfield
      coordination, Mission Setup Messages, diplomatic clearances, etc).
   1.7.4. Mixed Cargo must be moved using a mission priority and security level or procedure
   commensurate with the requirements of the classified cargo.
1.8. Mission Tasking. The applicable Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) will task the
appropriate unit(s) as follows:
   1.8.1. All DoD nuclear-related airlift missions will be tasked through established SAAM
   tasking procedures. AFNWC/NCL will provide an Airlift Request through the appropriate

                                             Chapter 2

                                   MISSION MANAGEMENT

2.1. General. This Chapter provides guidance in planning and scheduling DoD nuclear-related
and other DOE/NNSA cargo airlift missions. OPSEC is essential at all times and in all mission
correspondence. Mission success relies upon reliable, qualified, and prepared aircrews and
support personnel during all phases of a mission (from planning through execution).
2.2. Planning Criteria.
     2.2.1. Deliver cargo by the most efficient route to minimize the number of landings and
     handling of DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo.
     2.2.2. AFI 16-610, Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG) applies to DoD nuclear-
     related cargo movements per Attachment 2.
     2.2.3. Mission planners, shipper, and receiver personnel will coordinate on all scheduled
     operations and sequences of events.
     2.2.4. Mission planners will ensure all primary and supporting installation agencies are
     coordinated with when determining Crew Replacing, Staging, and Swapping sequence of
     events (SOE) and procedures for a particular mission. See paragraph 2.11 for additional
     execution guidance.
     2.2.5. Aircrew scheduling requirements/limits in applicable MDS Vol 3, MDS-Specific
     Operations Procedures, and this instruction apply.
     2.2.6. Ground Operations. Required ground operations vary greatly depending upon the
     cargo type, quantity, and overall complexity of the operation.
        2.2.6.1. Remain Over Night (RON). With prior coordination, missions carrying DoD
        nuclear-related, other DOE/NNSA cargo, or general cargo may be scheduled to RON at
        an en route location. Mission planners will coordinate to RON with DoD nuclear-related
        or other DOE/NNSA cargo aboard (Hot RON) through the installation DoD nuclear-
        related airlift mission POC.
            2.2.6.1.1. USAFE/A3/10 approval is required to Hot RON in the USAFE Area of
            Responsibility (AOR).
            2.2.6.1.2. Refer to the SWOG for additional DoD nuclear-related RON guidance.
        2.2.6.2. En route Stop (Non-RON). Normal ground time for loading and offloading is
        2+15 hours. Planners must adjust this time based on the type and quantity of cargo being
        transported, ground support available, and anticipated complexity of on/offload
        procedures.
        2.2.6.3. Pre/Depositioning Mission Segments.
            2.2.6.3.1. Due to stringent maintenance preparation for mission aircraft, schedule
            only the minimum number of legs required to position the aircraft at its onload
            location. If a stop is planned, it must be at an en route station able to provide suitable
            support if necessary.
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        9


          2.2.6.3.2. Missions may be scheduled to return to home station or other follow on
          non-nuclear mission tasking at the conclusion of a DoD nuclear-related or other
          DOE/NNSA cargo airlift mission. The Aircraft Commander may request a crew
          enhancement delay through normal channels if needed during mission execution.
          2.2.6.3.3. On depositioning legs without DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA
          cargo, the operating airlift wing may return the aircraft and crew to home station on
          training time. If the operating wing elects to operate on training time, aircrews will
          coordinate their intentions with the respective AOC prior to their depositioning leg.
          AOC planners will not recut the mission, but must be notified, and a change to the
          Setup Message will not be made. When requested by the operating mission wing,
          training time should be planned into Mission Setup Message prior to mission launch
          from home station to minimize coordination efforts during the airlift-tasked portion of
          the mission.
   2.2.7. Schedulers, planners, and operating crews must also consider the following:
       2.2.7.1. Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), to include the
       Classified   Supplement    (available at    https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil and
       https://www.fcg.pentagon.smil.mil).
       2.2.7.2. Host military command restrictions.
       2.2.7.3. Airfield restrictions, operating hours, Prior Permission Required (PPR), etc.
       2.2.7.4. User capability (hours of operation, security, etc.)
       2.2.7.5. DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108, Nuclear Weapons Security Manual.
       2.2.7.6. Deconflict mission itinerary with airfield non-support messages IAW AFI 21-
       203, Nuclear Accountability Procedures.
2.3. Air Refueling (A/R).
   2.3.1. A/R is not normally required for DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo
   movements.
   2.3.2. The appropriate AOC will coordinate altitude reservations with the appropriate
   altitude reservation facility. Plan a backup 24­hour slip in tanker support and altitude
   reservations, if applicable.
       2.3.2.1. Include the following information in the tanker request and A/R supplement:
          2.3.2.1.1. Airborne or manned ground spares for each primary tanker.
              2.3.2.1.1.1. AOC mission planners will determine the best option to meet the
              requirements of that particular mission segment. They will coordinate the
              information to the appropriate air refueling AOC planning section.
              2.3.2.1.1.2. AOC mission planners will provide the operating tanker crew a
              briefing concerning mission OPSEC, SWOG routing, and other relevant
              restrictions via secure means.
              2.3.2.1.1.3. AOC mission planners, flight managers, and tanker units may split
              the planned offload of fuel across multiple tankers.
 10                                                                 AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


            2.3.2.1.2. When refueling, SWOG restrictions apply to the tanker(s) when airlifting
            DoD nuclear-related cargo.
   2.3.3. To prepare for the unlikely event of an unsuccessful A/R when airlifting DoD nuclear-
   related and other DOE/NNSA cargo, support bases and pre-coordinated emergency divert
   locations identified in the Mission Setup Message will stand by to support emergency diverts
   until released by the appropriate AOC.
         2.3.3.1. Ensure the pre-coordinated emergency divert location is prepared to receive an
         aircraft in the event of an emergency divert. Should the A/R be aborted, the applicable
         AOC will notify the emergency divert location and confirm host nation
         notification/coordination.
   2.3.4. If the Aircraft Commander determines at any time that the planned A/R is not
   necessary, they must cancel A/R at the earliest opportunity. The Aircraft Commander’s
   decision is final.
   2.3.5. A/R over open ocean areas at least 12 nautical miles (NM) off shore.
   2.3.6. Accomplish the A/R IAW applicable MDS Vol 3.
   2.3.7. The Aircraft Commander will provide the post-A/R report to the controlling C2 cell
   via appropriate means within 15 minutes after completing an A/R.
         2.3.7.1. Do not attempt to contact the crew in flight to determine successful completion
         of the A/R unless no message has been received from the crew after 15 minutes past the
         anticipated completion of the air refueling. Contact the crew if a high priority message or
         emergency order must immediately be transmitted. The AOC will notify the appropriate
         pre-coordinated emergency divert location and release ground support personnel after the
         A/R is successfully completed.
2.4. Mission Planning/Coordination.
   2.4.1. Cargo Clearances. The AFNWC/NCL will transmit cargo clearance requests as
   required by the SWOG for DoD nuclear-related cargo. DOE/NNSA will transmit an
   Economy Act request for other DOE/NNSA cargo. A copy of the request will be forwarded
   to AOC planners.
      2.4.2. Overflight Clearances. Mission planners will coordinate overflight clearances as
      required by the SWOG and country specific Letters of Understanding.
   2.4.3. Diplomatic Clearances. Mission planners will coordinate Diplomatic Clearances as
   required by the SWOG and the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide.
   2.4.4. Flight plan DoD nuclear-related airlift missions with the utmost care. Consider factors
   such as weather, routing, overflight rights, suitable alternate/emergency airfields, host base
   capabilities, anticipated onload/offload times, and fuel requirements. Refer to the SWOG for
   additional information.
2.5. Mission Setup Message (Content, Classification, and Distribution).
   2.5.1. Mission planners will prepare a classified Mission Setup Message for all missions
   transporting DoD nuclear-related cargo and other DOE/NNSA cargo. AOC planners will
   send Setup Message at least 15-calendar days before home station departure. (See
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                    11


  Attachment 3 for a sample message). Support requirements will be coordinated by secure
  means at all times.
  2.5.2. The classified Mission Setup Message is the sole source of mission information to
  users and host bases.
  2.5.3. Mission Setup Messages will be classified according to mission destinations,
  overflight classification designated by the SWOG, or the Air Force Nuclear Weapons
  Security Classification Policy.
     2.5.3.1. PART I will be unclassified.
     2.5.3.2. PART II will be classified. All paragraph classifications will be marked in
     accordance with DoDM 5200.01, Vol 2, DoD Information Security Program: Marking
     of Classified Information.
  2.5.4. At a minimum, the Mission Setup Message will contain the following information:
     2.5.4.1. PART I Unclassified
         2.5.4.1.1. SAAM Number.
         2.5.4.1.2. Mission Itinerary.

         required by AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous
         Materials, to include all cargo weights, size, and detailed description.
         2.5.4.2.2. Security Requirements
         2.5.4.2.3. Specific station requirements. To preclude misunderstanding by host base
         support personnel, special requirements will be written in plain language with a clear
         and detailed description of the sequence of ground operations.
         2.5.4.2.4. Courier Officer Listing
     2.5.4.3. Information may be added or modified as long as messages are in standard
     format (Attachment 3).
  2.5.5. Distribution of Mission Setup Message
     2.5.5.1. Mission Setup Messages will be distributed to the operating unit, all DoD
     stations (including pre-coordinated emergency divert locations) identified on the mission
     itinerary, Command and Control entities, participating MAJCOMs and COCOMs, Air
     Force, Joint Staff, DTRA, and DOE/NNSA Office of Secure Transportation (OST).
     2.5.5.2. Requests to receive Mission Setup Messages should be made to AMC/A3N.

 12                                                                   AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


      2.5.6. Mission Setup Message (Station Support Requirements Acknowledgement and 24-
      hour Confirmation):
         2.5.6.1. The DOE/NNSA OST and all DoD stations listed on the mission itinerary will
         send an acknowledgement of ability to support/non-support the mission itinerary and/or
         the applicable special requirements listed in Part II of the Mission Setup Message. Note:
         DOE/NNSA will provide Acknowledgement of Station Support Requirement messages
         for all locations that do not have ability to send receive classified messages.
            2.5.6.1.1. The Acknowledgement of Station Support Requirements message will use
            a standard format. (AF Form 527D)
            2.5.6.1.2. Paragraph 7 of the Mission Setup Message will state when
            acknowledgement needs to be received by the mission planners, operational unit, and
            the applicable AOC. Mission planners will provide three working days for stations to
            send an acknowledgement to an original Mission Setup Message.
            2.5.6.1.3. A station only needs to send acknowledgement for the most current
            Mission Setup Message, i.e., when a change to a Mission Setup Message is released
            before a station has sent the acknowledgement for the previous message.
         2.5.6.2. A 24-hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will be sent by
         DOE/NNSA OST, all DoD en route stations and pre-coordinated emergency divert
         locations as listed in the mission itinerary. A station with multiple itinerary entries on the
         same day can be combined on one 24-hour message. A station with a single entry
         spanning two consecutive days and no additional entries on the second day need only
         send one 24-hour message. Note: DOE/NNSA will provide 24-hour Confirmation of
         Support Requirements messages for all locations that do not have ability to send receive
         classified messages.
            2.5.6.2.1. The 24-hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will use a
            standard format. (AF Form 527E)
            2.5.6.2.2. The 24-hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will be sent
            to the mission planners, operational unit, and applicable AOC no later than 24-hours
            prior to station arrival. If 24-hours prior falls on a non-duty day then the message
            will be sent the first duty day prior. The AOC will make a final voice confirmation of
            support from the 24-hour POC listed on the acknowledgement and confirmation
            messages.
            2.5.6.2.3. A station only needs to send a 24-hour Confirmation of Support message
            for the most current Mission Setup Message, i.e., when a change to a Mission Setup
            Message is released before a station has sent the 24-hour Confirmation for the
            previous message.
2.6. Changes to Mission Setup Message.
      2.6.1. Changes to Mission Setup Messages must be kept to a minimum. Should changes be
      absolutely necessary the following guidance will apply:
         2.6.1.1. All changes will be coordinated and distributed IAW paragraph 2.5.5. and
         acknowledged IAW para 2.5.6.
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      13


      2.6.1.2. Separate messages will be used for each change. Change messages will be in the
      original format with a clear statement advising the reason for change and all changes will
      clearly identify the information that is changed.
      2.6.1.3. Changes will not be generated solely to correct non-critical typographical errors.
      Write-in changes to Mission Setup Messages are not permitted.
   2.6.2. Requesting Changes to the Mission Setup Message.
      2.6.2.1. Requests to change a mission setup must come from the requesting unit’s Gp/CC
      or higher and be submitted to the AOC mission planners for coordination. The
      DOE/NNSA OST can provide this function for missions transporting other DOE/NNSA
      cargo.
      2.6.2.2. Stations that submit a non-support acknowledgement message will also send a
      request for change to the Setup Message.
      2.6.2.3. Requests to change the mission itinerary by greater than 2 hours will not be
      accepted within 10 days of mission execution.
      2.6.2.4. Missions enter execution 24-hours prior to scheduled home station departure and
      are complete after the last active leg of the mission itinerary. Changes to the mission
      setup will be issued automatically for the following:
          2.6.2.4.1. Mission is delayed more than 2 hours by maintenance, weather, or other
          factors.
          2.6.2.4.2. Change to cargo information that does not impact the itinerary or timing
          beyond 2 hours.
          2.6.2.4.3. Aircraft Divert
          2.6.2.4.4. A change will not be issued solely to cancel an A/R.
   2.6.3. Waiver authority for requests made up to 5 days prior to execution may be delegated
   to AOC Director, Current Operations. Note: Waiver requests that do not contain the
   following information below will be denied:
      2.6.3.1. Name, grade, unit and title of requester.
      2.6.3.2. Date of request.
      2.6.3.3. Mission number of affected mission.
      2.6.3.4. Detailed reason the change is necessary.
      2.6.3.5. Date and time the required change was discovered.
   2.6.4. When changes to the itinerary are necessary after a mission has started, the AOC will
   coordinate with AOC mission planners to publish changes to the Mission Setup Message and
   forward to the aircrew with an information copy to the operating wing. To avoid delay of a
   mission, voice confirmation of changes between AOC and the aircrew are acceptable but
   should be used as a last resort only. Changes to the Mission Setup Message will be
   forwarded to all stations and the operating wing using the format in Attachment 3.
2.7. Additional Airlift Requirements.
14                                                                  AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


  2.7.1. Attachment 2 lists the types of DoD nuclear-related and DOE/NNSA materials and
  associated handling requirements. The AFNWC/NCL will schedule DoD nuclear and
  nuclear-related cargo missions via the Nuclear Ordnance Shipping Schedule (NOSS). Any
  changes to the AFNWC/NCL SAAM Airlift Request must be coordinated between AOC
  mission planners and the AFNWC/NCL. Coordination must be accomplished as soon as
  additional cargo is identified.
  2.7.2. If changes to DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo are approved before the
  mission starts, the Mission Setup Message will be changed through normal channels via
  procedures listed in paragraph 2.6.
  2.7.3. Only DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo identified in the Mission Setup
  Message and Airlift Request or Economy Act may be accepted.
        2.7.3.1. If a discrepancy is identified between the DoD nuclear-related or other
        DOE/NNSA cargo, the Mission Setup Message, the Airlift Request, or the Economy Act,
        contact the AOC mission planners through the Consolidated Control Center (CCC). The
        AOC will immediately contact AFNWC/NCL or DOE/NNSA POC to resolve any
        discrepancies. The AFNWC/NCL or DOE/NNSA POC will identify to the AOC
        acceptable actions, e.g. serial number of nuclear cargo transposed. AFNWC/NCL or
        DOE/NNSA POC will recommend if the DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo
        should be accepted by AMC Courier or should remain at the shipping unit and
        transported on a future mission. The Courier retains the ultimate authority to accept or
        deny DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo.
        2.7.3.2. If AFNWC/NCL or DOE/NNSA POC, AOC, and the aircrew resolve the
        discrepancy and the decision is made to move the DoD nuclear-related or other
        DOE/NNSA cargo, AFNWC/NCL or DOE/NNSA POC will issue a new Airlift
        Request/Economy Act and the AOC will issue a new SAAM Setup Message. The
        aircrew will attempt to attain a hard copy of the Airlift Request/Economy Act and Setup
        Message before departure. If unable to attain a hard copy due to operational restrictions
        (i.e. at a foreign installation), the aircrew may continue the mission after receiving an
        unclassified email confirmation. Use a voice confirmation as a last resort.
        2.7.3.3. If a discrepancy is identified at the arrival/offload location, it will be resolved
        prior to offloading DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo.
     2.7.4. Cargo:
        2.7.4.1. Opportune cargo may be carried on positioning legs, but do not change the route
        of flight to solely accommodate the movement of cargo.
        2.7.4.2. Unused space aboard DoD nuclear-related cargo missions may be used for
        general cargo if:
            2.7.4.2.1. The user approves the cargo to be aboard.
            2.7.4.2.2. Extra landings will not be required.
            2.7.4.2.3. The added weight will not cause problems with required fuel, aircraft
            center of gravity (CG), etc.
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        15


          2.7.4.2.4. It is compatible with the DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo.
          Use the hazardous material compatibility chart in AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing
          Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, for air transportation to determine
          compatibility with other explosive and hazardous materials.
          2.7.4.2.5. General cargo (if jettisonable) must be loaded so it may be jettisoned, if
          necessary, without disturbing the DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo.
          Note: Time permitting aircrews should jettison general cargo before jettisoning DoD
          nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo. Furthermore, jettison unclassified DoD
          nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo before jettisoning classified DoD
          nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo.
          2.7.4.2.6. It will not cause security problems, including aerial port onloading and
          offloading.

      DoD nuclear-related cargo. Additionally, foreign nationals will not be used to load or
      offload general cargo when DoD nuclear-related cargo is already aboard the aircraft.
      This restriction does not apply to other DOE/NNSA cargo.
2.8. Passengers, Mission Essential Personnel, and Flying Crew Chief.
   2.8.1. Passengers:
      2.8.1.1. Passengers may be carried on any mission segment in which the aircraft is empty
      or only carrying general cargo.
      2.8.1.2. When classified DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo is aboard, only
      the following passengers may be carried as necessary to accomplish the mission:
          2.8.1.2.1. Couriers, shipper escorts, authorized inspectors, flying crew chiefs,
          security forces, and DoD or DOE/NNSA personnel manifested as duty passengers.
          Passengers shall be authorized in the Airlift Request, Economy Act, or by separate
          message. All personnel lists must be provided to the operating wing a minimum of
          ten days prior to home station departure.
          2.8.1.2.2. DOE/NNSA personnel who fly on other DOE/NNSA movements will be
          manifested as duty passengers. These individuals will accompany the aircrew to/from
          onload/offload locations. In-flight duties will include, but are not limited to, ensuring
          the cargo remains at safe radiation levels during transport. When transporting other
          DOE/NNSA cargo requiring radiation monitoring, DOE/NNSA will ensure
          appropriate personnel accompany the mission to perform this function.
          2.8.1.2.3. DOE/NNSA personnel requiring airlift on other DOE/NNSA cargo
          missions will be identified by the DOE/NNSA NLT ten days prior to mission
          execution. The Field Operations Officer or designee from the Office of Secure
          Transportation (OST) will provide a listing with individual information. For
          questions contact: Office: (505) 845-4180/4448/5071 or STE: (505) 845-
          4180/6262/4867.

        authority, their SSN, security clearance, specific mission for which MEP is requested,
        and reason for participating in the mission. This information must be provided to the
        operating wing a minimum of ten days prior to home station departure.
        2.8.2.1.2. MEP procedures and approval will be IAW AFI 11-401. MEP authority is
        granted for specific individuals on particular missions. MEP authority will not be
        used as blanket approval on all DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA airlift
        missions nor will it constitute personnel travel clearance required by the DoD Foreign
        Clearance Guide. Inspector and observer lists will be approved by AMC/A3 after
        coordination through AMC/A3N. Lists may remain valid for up to a year, and must
        be renewed annually or when personnel changes dictate.
        2.8.2.1.3. Classify requests appropriately if a specific mission or location is included.
        Approve requests for MEP based on security clearance, need-to-know, space
        available on the aircraft, and valid in-flight or ground duty to perform.
        2.8.2.1.4. Without a specific in-flight duty, individuals requesting MEP to observe
        onload and offload operations will not be approved if any other transportation is
        available.
        2.8.2.1.5. Commanders of tasked operating wings and NAFs may authorize MEP
        status for people under their command. All others must be approved by AMC/A3.
        2.8.2.1.6. AMC/A3 validated MEP letters will be transmitted via message from
        AMC/A3N, and approved by the owning Operations Group Commander.
     2.8.2.2. IAW AFI 11-401, the Operations Group Commander is the final authority of
     MEP status on DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA airlift missions operated by
     their wing. MEPs must be on official orders, and fall into the following categories:
        2.8.2.2.1. Commanders, supervisors of aircrews, and related programs: Vice
        commanders, operations group commanders, deputy operations group commanders,
        squadron/unit commanders, and operations officers.
        2.8.2.2.2. Certified aircrew flight examiners from the operating parent wing or
        MAJCOM.
        2.8.2.2.3. Chiefs of Safety and Nuclear Surety Managers (NSM) from the parent

        NSSAVs, or escorting authorized DVs. Crewmembers and guests are either part of
        the crew or on MEP status, but not both for any given mission day.
        2.8.2.2.5. MAJCOM inspector general, Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA), Air
        Force Safety Center (AFSEC), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and AMC
        Nuclear      Surety     office   inspectors   and     augmentees   conducting
        inspections/observations. Note: AFIA, AMC/IG, DTRA, and AMC/SEW offices are
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                    17


        responsible for distributing and maintaining current authorization letters. Updated
        letters will be sent via email which have been digitally signed to AMC/A3N, 618
        AOC (TACC)/XOOOD, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG, 603 AOC (TACC), and 4
        AS/DOOMS offices as soon as changes occur to ensure authenticity.
     2.8.2.3. MEP authorization (individual orders or MAJCOM/NAF message) will have the
     approval authority, security clearance, SSN, mission number, and reason for participating
     in the mission. Orders will not specify a particular mission number. Classified mission
     details will be transmitted via classified means (i.e. SIPRnet, Secure Fax, etc.).

     Aircraft Commander when joining the mission en route) on specific mission information
     needed to accomplish their assigned task. Briefing will include familiarization on
     applicable security and safety standards and emergency procedures.
     2.8.2.5. MEPs must be positively identified by a service or agency official identification
     card.
     2.8.2.6. Travel orders for MEPs will cite the MEP authority and be presented to aircrew
     before mission operation.
     2.8.2.7. MEP authority provides direct access to the mission aircraft without processing
     through passenger service section; therefore, the aircrew is responsible for manifest and
     anti-hijacking procedures for MEPs. The Loadmaster will annotate all MEPs on a DD
     Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
     2.8.2.8. MEP verification. Aircraft commanders will not allow anyone to fly on a DoD
     nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo mission unless they are convinced of the
     person's identity and the legality of their authorization.
        2.8.2.8.1. If there is any doubt or suspicion, regardless of rank or position,
        diplomatically but firmly deny access to the aircraft and cargo.
        2.8.2.8.2. Unless an MEP is personally known, do not accept just a set of orders as
        authorization. Verify and confirm the orders through other channels. For example,
        MAJCOM IG, AFIA, AFSEC, DTRA, and AMC Nuclear Surety inspectors are
        identified on a master inspector’s list/letter. If required the Aircraft Commander will
        call outside offices for verification.
  2.8.3. Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC). Flying crew chiefs are not normally required on DoD
  nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo missions. FCCs may be scheduled on DoD
  nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA missions at the discretion of the operating wing
  commander.
     2.8.3.1. FCCs must possess a final Secret security clearance.
     2.8.3.2. The Aircraft Commander will brief the FCC and must cover security precautions
     to prevent inadvertent violations by the FCC. Stress safety precautions to include
     specific precautions in Chapter 8.
     2.8.3.3. FCCs will not seal mission aircraft, nor will they be allowed unescorted access
     to aircraft containing DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo. Do not leave the
     FCC in sole custody of the aircrew mission publications, forms, letters, or aircrew
 18                                                              AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


       sidearms. Exception: When servicing and maintenance are required, the FCC may seal
       empty DoD nuclear-related/DOE/NNSA mission aircraft.
2.9. Aircrew Qualification and Certification.
   2.9.1. Crewmembers who occupy a primary crew position when DoD nuclear-related or
   other DOE/NNSA cargo is airlifted will be qualified and current according to AFI 11-2 MDS
   Vol 2, MDS-Specific Evaluation Criteria.

 AFI 11-MDS Vol 3.
 Note 4. Only applicable if PNAF aircrew is required IAW Attachment 2 and T.O. 11N-45-51.
 List authorized Courier officers in the Mission Setup Message. Do not annotate on the flight
 authorization.
2.11. Aircrew Replacement and Staging.
   2.11.1. Do not replace crewmembers unless absolutely necessary. Avoiding Courier
   replacement is especially critical due to briefing requirements, letters of introduction, Courier
   identification, and custody receipt.
   2.11.2. See Chapter 6 for specific procedures if a Courier is replaced.
   2.11.3. Aircrew Staging and Crew Swap.
      2.11.3.1. All planned stage and swap crews will receive a predeparture briefing at home
      station. During execution, crewmembers will brief counterparts on unique mission
      aspects not covered during the predeparture mission briefing.
      2.11.3.2. Crew Staging. Pre-position aircrews at forward/en route locations to maximize
      throughput in large scale (multi-mission) movements. This practice eliminates pre-and
      de-positioning legs. It may involve swapping crews at an en route location with DoD
      nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo aboard, but will not involve handling of DoD
      nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo at the en route location used.
      2.11.3.3. Crew Swap. A crew swap is defined as using pre-positioned crews to initiate
      or complete a DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo mission. This option may
      only be used when absolutely necessary, to avoid crew duty day waivers, to maximize
      surety, and only after all normal scheduling options are exhausted.
          2.11.3.3.1. Mission planners will ensure all primary and supporting installation
          agencies are coordinated with when determining Crew Swap SOEs and procedures
          for a particular mission.
          2.11.3.3.2. When used prior to mission departure, a pre-positioned crew may pre-
          flight and pre-position the aircraft and onload DoD nuclear-related cargo via normal
          procedures. They will then transfer the cargo and mission responsibilities over to the
          main operating crew to execute the primary mission segment.
          2.11.3.3.3. When used after mission arrival, a pre-positioned crew may receive DoD
          nuclear-related cargo and mission responsibilities from the primary crew then offload
          the cargo, post-flight and re-position the aircraft as necessary via normal procedures.

   "required overhead" fuel. List this fuel in the "stored fuel" on the appropriate fuel planning
   form according to applicable MDS Vol 3. Security alternate fuel is designed for all missions
   to allow the Aircraft Commander the option of departure from an immature or deteriorating
   security situation. This is in addition to all other required fuel. Do not offload DoD nuclear-
   related cargo to allow for security alternate fuel. General cargo will be offloaded to allow for
   security alternate fuel.
   4.2.3. Flight Planning. Enter "hazardous cargo," "inert devices," or both if applicable and
   the mission number in the "remarks" section of the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or in
   the "other information" section of the DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan. Note:
   LLCs with line numbers and certain Type 3 trainers and JTAs are hazardous cargo.
   4.2.4. On air refueled DoD nuclear-related cargo mission segments, use the pre-coordinated
   emergency divert location designated in the Mission Setup Message if at all possible. If a
   different emergency divert location is necessary, inform the controlling CCC as soon as
   possible so the duty controller can advise the new emergency divert location. Before takeoff,
   the Aircraft Commander must ensure the new emergency divert location confirms security is
   available.
   4.2.5. At Air Force bases, do not display hazardous cargo placards (explosives category 1.1,
   etc.). The host will determine use of placards at other bases.
4.3. Aircraft Preparation.
   4.3.1. Chapter 8 contains further information for aircraft selection and preparation.
   4.3.2. Ensure appropriate T.O. 1C-MDS-1 and -9, Loading Instructions, preloading
   checklists are complete prior to commencing onload of DoD nuclear-related and other
   DOE/NNSA cargo.
   4.3.3. The necessary aerospace ground equipment (AGE) and support equipment will be pre-
   positioned at the designated parking area before aircraft arrival. The equipment will be fully
   serviced and inspected for serviceability before placement at the parking area. After engines
   are shut down, ensure AGE equipment is positioned so that it minimizes blockage of taxi
   routes and avenues of exit.
 24                                                                 AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


4.4. Cargo Acceptance and Transfer.
      4.4.1. The Courier will accept and transfer custody of cargo in accordance with Chapter 6.
      Only DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo identified in the Mission Setup
      Message, Airlift Request, or Economy Act may be accepted and handled. If cargo differs
      from the Mission Setup Message, Airlift Request, or the Economy Act, follow procedures
      IAW paragraph 2.7.3.
      4.4.2. Do not ship items which have been exposed to abnormal conditions unless specifically
      authorized.
      4.4.3. Custody of DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo is transferred upon
      signing the DD Form 1911.
4.5. Loading and Offloading Procedures. DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo
will be loaded only on a mission capable aircraft serviced and prepared for loading. The aircrew
is responsible for safe and proper loading of the cargo.
      4.5.1. The primary mission Loadmaster will direct loading, tie down, load distribution, and
      shipping preparation of DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo.
   4.5.2. Use T.O. 1C-MDS-1 and -9 procedures for loading and offloading.
      4.5.3. Host installations shall consider prohibiting restricted area photography for force
      protection or OPSEC concerns. If local installations prohibit photography, procedures for
      gaining photography authorization will be included in the installation defense plan.
      4.5.4. Handle DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo with care and avoid
      excessive handling. Handle only one item, pallet, or package of cargo at a time. When hand-
      carrying, use both hands if practical.
      4.5.5. During inclement weather (high winds, ice storms, etc.), onload and offload may be
      delayed due to local policies or the Aircraft Commander's judgment.
      4.5.6. Loadmaster will determine what cargo is jettisonable. This is a physical determination
      with reference to limitations of AFMAN 24-204(I) or T.O. 1C-MDS-9. Loadmaster will
      ensure crew is aware of all cargo that is non-jettisonable.
4.6. Ground Emergencies.
      4.6.1. Anyone observing an unsafe act or condition during any ground phase of the DoD
      nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo mission will immediately stop the operation.
      Correct the condition before operations are resumed. Report all situations to the Aircraft
      Commander.
         4.6.1.1. If DoD nuclear-related cargo is dropped during handling and the container
         remains intact, coordinate with the shipper to annotate damage on DoD Form 1911.
         4.6.1.2. If a DOE/NNSA container is dropped during handling and the shipping
         container remains intact, check with the DOE/NNSA representative to ensure item can
         still be shipped.
         4.6.1.3. If a DoD nuclear-related or DOE/NNSA container is dropped or otherwise
         damaged during handling and the shipping container ruptures, coordinate emergency
         actions with security forces and fire department. Notify tower or ground control
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       25


       requesting them to notify the local support United States EOD team immediately and
       declare a ground emergency. Evacuate nonessential persons upwind, if possible, a
       minimum of 2,500 feet or as briefed.
   4.6.2. Security Emergencies. Resist any attempt by a hostile force to capture DoD nuclear-
   related or other DOE/NNSA cargo IAW AFI 31-117.
4.7. Engine Running Onload and Offload (ERO) Procedures.
   4.7.1. ERO procedures may only be used to load or offload LLCs and Group X kits on
   missions transporting DoD nuclear-related cargo. Do not ERO bolstered DoD nuclear-
   related trainers.
   4.7.2. General procedures for EROs are in applicable MDS Vol 3. The following additional
   information applies:
       4.7.2.1. No more than 50 floor loaded LLCs will be loaded or offloaded during an ERO.
       4.7.2.2. C-17, C-5, and C-130 aircraft are approved to ERO palletized LLCs.
       4.7.2.3. Troop doors and crew entrance door will not be used for ERO.
       4.7.2.4. Transfer all paperwork inside the aircraft.
       4.7.2.5. If there is any question regarding the overall safety of the ERO, shutdown all
       engines before onload or offload operations.
4.8. Procedures for Crossload Transfer of DoD Nuclear-Related and Other DOE/NNSA
Cargo. An aircraft change may be necessary during a DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA
airlift mission due to maintenance or other unforeseen problems. This could occur at home
station, en route, or at an emergency divert location. Aircraft change may require a crossload of
the cargo to keep it moving to its final destination. In the event such a transfer must occur, the
following procedures will help ensure a safe, secure transfer of DoD nuclear-related cargo from
one aircraft to another.
   4.8.1. Do not begin crossload of DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo until the
   replacement aircraft has been fully configured, fueled, preflighted, and appropriate security
   requirements are in place.
   4.8.2. One Courier will maintain custody of the cargo throughout the crossload.           Any
   transfer of custody will occur before or after the crossload.
   4.8.3. Aircrew will ensure the safest and most secure environment for any DoD nuclear-
   related or other DOE/NNSA cargo involved in the crossload.
   4.8.4. Aircrew will be responsible for the transfer operation. They will work closely with
   the shipper or receiver, munitions, security, intelligence, and transportation personnel.
   4.8.5. The Aircraft Commander and Courier will conduct briefings with all personnel
   participating in aircraft crossload. The briefings will include an overview of the crossload
   operation and each participant will be briefed on individual duties. The primary Loadmaster
   will brief loading/offloading duties as required during the operation.
   4.8.6. Aircrew will coordinate with security forces to ensure security requirements are
   understood and security is adequate before commencing the crossload operation.
 26                                                              AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


   4.8.7. If the cargo is transferred to a new aircraft and crew, the original aircrew is
   responsible for offloading, and the new crew is responsible for loading the new aircraft. The
   accepting aircrew will have custody of DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo at
   the time of transfer in writing.
4.9. Departure Procedures.
   4.9.1. Destination Support Confirmation. Aircraft with any DoD nuclear-related or other
   DOE/NNSA cargo aboard must not take off until all destinations and pre-coordinated
   emergency divert locations acknowledge that they are capable of meeting security
   requirements. Before beginning each day's operation, check with the MAJCOM CCC and/or
   the DOE/NNSA Field Operations Officer or designee from the Office of Secure
   Transportation (OST) for the status of stations to be transited that day. CCC will review the
   mission folder to ensure all stations on the day's itinerary have confirmed security and
   support requirements. CCC will use all other sources available, e.g., airfield threat security
   evaluations file, etc., to evaluate the security status of en route stations. CCC must be
   prepared to rapidly appraise security for a DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA mission
   and provide any changes to the crew immediately. If security is questionable or an
   acknowledgment message has not been received, CCC will immediately attempt to confirm
   security, holding departure to the suspect station until security is confirmed. If the 24-hour
   confirmation of support message is not available, call the destination base or the DOE/NNSA
   Field Operations Officer or designee from the Office of Secure Transportation (OST)
   directly. The AOC can help provide base contacts and telephone numbers.
   4.9.2. Departure Message:
      4.9.2.1. Once airborne, the aircrew will contact the CCC directly via aircraft radio or
      phone patch with their departure time and estimated time of arrival (ETA).
          4.9.2.1.1. DoD nuclear-related missions. CCC will notify destination point of
          contact (identified in their acknowledgment message) by the most expeditious means
          available and pass aircraft type, mission number, tail number, and ETA. Insist
          security forces be notified. If CCC is unable to contact destination, they will advise
          the Aircraft Commander. The Aircraft Commander will make the final decision to
          land or divert to a pre-coordinated emergency divert location. Note: OPSEC
          procedures are extremely important during this process. Make every effort to avoid
          "signatures" of a classified mission. Avoid discussions that could reveal the purpose
          of the mission.
          4.9.2.1.2. For missions with short en route times or several quick stops that would
          make departure calls to destinations impractical, CCC may phone destinations before
          aircraft is airborne.
          4.9.2.1.3. Other DOE/NNSA missions. If the mission will not arrive on time at the
          offload station as a result of a late departure, contact the applicable AOC mission
          planners and have them contact one of the following: Senior Aviation Official for
          DOE/NNSA, Office: (202) 586-6177, Cell: (301) 602-3139; The Office of Secure
          Transportation (OST) Transportation and Emergency Control Center (TECC): 1-800-
          428-0496 (For CONUS arrivals, the OST TECC will contact the convoy personnel so
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      27


          they are ready to provide security and receive the cargo upon arrival); or other
          installation/agency POCs as necessary.
4.10. CCC Coordination.
   4.10.1. The aircrew must keep the appropriate AOC advised of mission progress. If ETA
   changes by more than 15 minutes, the arrival destination must be informed as soon as
   possible.
   4.10.2. Releasing Pre-coordinated Emergency Divert Locations.
      4.10.2.1. AOC mission planners will develop Mission Setup Message support
      requirements for applicable pre-coordinated emergency divert locations. Bases will be
      tasked to support the unlikely event of an emergency divert for any reason (ex: Weather,
      A/R, maintenance, etc.). AOC mission planners will coordinate with the operating unit
      during mission planning to establish standby posture requirements and key time
      points/related mission milestones (completion of A/R, ETP passage, etc.).
      4.10.2.2. The Aircraft Commander will contact the appropriate AOC when passed the
      key time points/related mission milestones. Upon concurrence with the Aircraft
      Commander, the appropriate AOC will contact the pre-coordinated emergency divert
      location command post to release the installation’s standby requirements.
   4.10.3. Aircraft Divert. The Aircraft Commander will inform the appropriate AOC as soon
   as possible after coordinating any divert with air traffic control agencies. The AOC will
   notify the pre-coordinated emergency divert location, appropriate en route agencies, host
   nation authorities, and the original destination to advise them the aircraft is diverting.
4.11. Arrival Procedures.
   4.11.1. DoD nuclear-related cargo.
      4.11.1.1. In-Flight Notification:
          4.11.1.1.1. At least 30-minutes before ETA, contact one of the following in this
          order: (1) command post, (2) base operations, or (3) control tower. If required, pass
          the SAAM number and verify the base is prepared for the aircraft arrival. Request the
          ETA be passed to appropriate support agencies, including the agency specified as
          single point-of-contact in the security acknowledgment message.
          4.11.1.1.2. If the arrival base does not have hazardous cargo information, request the
          following be relayed immediately to the crash-fire protection agency and other
          support agencies as appropriate:
             4.11.1.1.2.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
             4.11.1.1.2.2. ETA.
             4.11.1.1.2.3. DoD explosives hazard class and division.
             4.11.1.1.2.4. Request for special handling (isolated parking, security, etc.).
          4.11.1.1.3. On legs with no hazardous cargo aboard, pass the call sign, mission
          number, and any special requests to the appropriate agency at least 30-minutes before
          ETA.
 28                                                                 AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


      4.11.2. Other DOE/NNSA cargo.
         4.11.2.1. If there is a U.S. presence, contact the destination with ETA when 30-minutes
         from the airfield.
   4.11.3. Taxi and Parking. It is the Aircraft Commander's responsibility to make host airfield
   operations aware of the need for isolated parking. It is a host base responsibility to ensure
   the taxi route and parking spot meet the quantity-distance separation requirements of
   AFMAN 91201, Explosives Safety Standards, and T.O. 11N­45­51A.
   4.11.4. Arrival Message. Contact CCC with unclassified arrival information as soon as
   possible after landing. CCC will dispatch arrival message.
4.12. Divert to Alternate Airfield.
   4.12.1. Refer to the SWOG for additional guidance on divert locations, unscheduled landing,
   and inadvertent overflight procedures when carrying DoD nuclear-related cargo.
   4.12.2. If pre-coordinated emergency divert locations cannot be used or as listed in the
   SWOG, alternate emergency sites may be considered according to the SWOG priority and
   the following:
         4.12.2.1. Be under US military control.
         4.12.2.2. Have adequate security. DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 and the SWOG
         contain additional information on security guidance for emergency diverts.
         4.12.2.3. Should have a nuclear storage capability. Every attempt should be made to
         store DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo on the aircraft while at non-
         nuclear emergency divert location or at a location without nuclear storage capacity during
         entire ground time. This might be unacceptable from a security, maintenance, or host
         base or theater point of view.
   4.12.3. Ensure the route to be flown to the divert location is compatible with the SWOG.
   4.12.4. If aircraft maintenance is a problem, consider maintenance capability at the alternate
   location.
   4.12.5. If the divert location is in CONUS or a US military base in a foreign country, use
   procedures in the SWOG as well as the following additional guidance:
         4.12.5.1. Have controlling CCC relay hazardous cargo information and coordinate
         arrangements for security, storage, etc. Give 30­minute in-flight notification.
         4.12.5.2. If unable to contact CCC or if CCC cannot contact alternate base, request
         security forces meet the aircraft in the 30-minute notification call.
   4.12.6. If the airfield is in a foreign country, but not under US military control, contact
   controlling CCC and relay the aircraft call sign, mission number, aircraft type, airport of
   intended landing, ETA, and reason for the emergency divert. Request assistance from
   nearest Air Force base, American Embassy, or consulate. Landing in any foreign country is
   extremely sensitive and will be handled as quietly as possible with the agency controlling the
   field. Keep mission as inconspicuous as possible while still protecting DoD nuclear-related
   cargo. Use procedures in the DoD FCG to protect the sensitivity, which states, "US military
   aircraft are sovereign instrumentalities.” When cleared to overfly or land in foreign territory,
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        29


   it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to privileges and immunities which
   customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities include, in the absence
   of stipulations to the contrary: exemption from duties and taxation; immunity from search,
   seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections); or other exercise of
   jurisdiction by the host nation over aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo aboard.
      4.12.6.1. Air Force Aircraft Commanders will not authorize search, seizure, inspection,
      or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by
      direction of Air Force headquarters or the American Embassy in the country concerned.
      Diplomatically, but firmly, deny any access to aircraft by foreign officials and attempt to
      have US officials in the country resolve the problem.
4.13. Emergency Procedures. During any emergency, aircrew must take every precaution to
protect lives and property. The following emergency procedures apply:
   4.13.1. Pass the following information to appropriate ATC agency and request it be passed
   to the divert location:
      4.13.1.1. Aircraft call sign, nature of the emergency and landing intentions.
      4.13.1.2. Aircraft position and ETA to destination.
      4.13.1.3. Number of personnel aboard.
      4.13.1.4. Fuel aboard.
      4.13.1.5. Hazardous cargo is aboard.
   4.13.2. Make a 30-minute prior-to-arrival radio call to the destination base to include:
      4.13.2.1. Location of the cargo.
      4.13.2.2. A statement that "negative hazardous cargo is aboard" when aircraft carries
      inert devices only.
      4.13.2.3. A description of the physical appearance and location in the aircraft of inert
      devices when mixed loads of hazardous material and inert devices are aboard.
   4.13.3. If an emergency requires an immediate landing and the Aircraft Commander must
   choose between communication security and flight safety, then safety will take precedence.
   Classified information may be disclosed to the extent necessary for safety of flight.
   4.13.4. In an emergency, the Aircraft Commander bears moral obligation to jettison cargo or
   crash-land where the least amount of damage will result. Record coordinates of each
   jettisoned item. Observe jettison restrictions in the SWOG.
4.14. Border Clearance Procedures.
   4.14.1. Purpose. To give aircrews border clearance procedures when carrying LLCs and
   classified nuclear support materiel.
   4.14.2. Policy and Procedures.      Border clearance is the responsibility of the Aircraft
   Commander.
      4.14.2.1. Use general border clearance procedures in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3.
 30                                                                 AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


         4.14.2.2. Prepare cargo manifests (DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest) for customs officials
         on all cargo. The shipper will supply manifests for unclassified non-nuclear cargo.
         Loadmasters will prepare manifests for DoD nuclear-related cargo and other classified
         cargo. List this cargo as classified material, classified cargo, hazardous material,
         classified test equipment, or similar wording which best describes it. Descriptions must
         not associate cargo with nuclear material. These manifests must include number of units,
         weight, and cubic displacement in feet.
         4.14.2.3. Waivers of Customs and Quarantine Boarding. A letter will be prepared and
         reproduced in the format depicted in Attachment 4.2. with appropriate organizational
         letterhead.
      4.14.3. The Aircraft Commander will tactfully request US customs and agriculture
      quarantine inspectors accept a waiver for boarding and examination of aircraft because of the
      classified cargo aboard.
         4.14.3.1. If waiver is denied and the aircraft is at an enroute location, the Aircraft
         Commander will request a "permit to proceed" to the final destination.
      4.14.4. When filing a flight plan into a base that does not have customs or agriculture
      quarantine inspectors readily available, request customs and/or agriculture inspectors meet
      the aircraft by contacting the arrival base command post/AMCC. Determine hours of
      operations of customs facilities and comply with any requirements for advance notification.
      In a divert situation, give as much lead-time as possible to arrange for customs and
      agriculture inspectors.
4.15. Crew Rest Procedures. Before entering crew rest at an en route station, the Aircraft
Commander will ensure the aircraft is sealed (as required). Provide command post and AOC
contact information during crew rest in the case of an emergency.
4.16. Itinerary Deviation.
      4.16.1. As soon as it is apparent a mission will deviate from published itinerary, notify the
      appropriate CCC of ETA for remaining en route stations on that day's itinerary. CCC will
      immediately notify destination or DOE/NNSA points of contact and appropriate diplomatic
      clearance authorities by telephone. Passing timely and accurate information to destination is
      extremely important.
      4.16.2. If a mission deviates by two or more hours from last published itinerary, the CCC
      will coordinate with the Aircraft Commander and AOC mission planning to send a mission
      change message (Attachment 3). Points of contact at bases scheduled to be transited, the pre-
      coordinated emergency divert location, and tanker unit (if applicable), and appropriate en
      route agencies will also be advised by secure means of new times. Do not launch until CCC
      and/or DOE/NNSA has determined subsequent stations for that day can accept the mission in
      accordance with the revised plan. If the aircrew coordinates directly with the shipper or
      receiver, advise CCC.
      4.16.3. Mission Change Message:
         4.16.3.1. The mission planning section will coordinate mission change message with the
         Aircraft Commander. Attempt to return mission to its original itinerary by adjusting
         ground times if possible. Do not sacrifice proper crew rest to return to the original
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      31


     schedule; however, do not perpetuate small delays by using originally planned ground
     times if less time will provide adequate crew rest.
     4.16.3.2. The Aircraft Commander will relay revised information to CCC. CCC is
     responsible for checking times for conflicts with other missions, notifying the pre-
     coordinated divert location, tanker unit (if applicable), appropriate en route agencies, and
     remaining bases. The mission planning section will draft and send any message traffic
     required. Take care to ensure classified information is not compromised.
     4.16.3.3. Use Attachment 3, format, and classify the mission change message the same
     as original Mission Setup Message or in accordance with the SWOG. Include hazardous
     cargo information if changed from the Setup Message. Changes to overflight information
     messages required by the SWOG will normally be made as directed in the SWOG or
     Letters-of-Agreement (LOA).
     4.16.3.4. Include all addressees in the Mission Setup Message including the aircrew’s
     current location, divert locations, and remaining bases. Omit stations already transited.
  4.16.4. Unscheduled Hot RON. Mission delays may force the aircrew into an unscheduled
  Hot RON. If it becomes apparent to an Aircraft Commander the crew will not be able to
  proceed to the next destination and complete the offload within remaining CDT, he or she
  will immediately contact AMC CCC and request authority for either:
     4.16.4.1. An extension to crew duty day.
     4.16.4.2. Permission to offload cargo and attempt the mission at a later time.
     4.16.4.3. Permission to Hot RON at current location, emergency divert location, or
     destination airfield. Do not proceed to destination if the mission will arrive without
     sufficient time to complete offload (if one is planned) unless destination base has
     confirmed through CCC they can support the Hot RON.               At USAFE bases,
     USAFE/A3/10 approval is required for a Hot RON. CCC will coordinate Hot RON
     requests through USAFE/A3/10NM.

                                            SECURITY

5.1. General. Security standards for DoD nuclear-related cargo, aircraft sanitization, EALs, and
emergency security actions are listed in DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. Security standards
for PL 1, 2, and 3 area entry control, marking, and security requirements are located in AFI 31-
101.
5.2. Types of Security. The degree of security protection will vary according to the cargo.
DoD security requirements are broken into two categories, Type I security and Type II security.
Refer to DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 for a full description of Type I and Type II
security. Refer to AFI 31-101 for a full description of PL 1, 2, and 3 security. Note: When
discussing security requirements with another service, a detailed description may be necessary.
5.3. Protection Standards. Provide security IAW Attachment 2. Aircrew will ensure security
meets DoD and Air Force standards. As a minimum, all DOE/NNSA cargo requires Type II
security.
5.4. Sanitization. Sanitized aircraft are not required for DoD nuclear-related and other
DOE/NNSA cargo.
5.5. Type II Restricted Area Procedures. Use Type II security to protect DoD nuclear-related
cargo while in logistic transport status IAW Attachment 2. Aircrew will provide Type II security
while it is in aircrew custody. Request an acknowledgement from the RON base to ensure they
can support Type II security requirements.
   5.5.1. Searches and inspections of hand-carried items are not required during Protection
   Level 3 (PL3) or Type II security operations, but may be directed by the local security forces.
   5.5.2. Type II Entry Authority. Authenticate and give the guard a list of persons authorized
   to grant entry and serve as escort while the crew is gone (EAL or aircrew orders). When
   classified, DoD nuclear-related, or DOE/NNSA cargo is aboard, only the aircrew can grant
   entry and serve as escorts. The Courier may designate any responsible person as entry and
   escort authority when the aircraft is empty. The escort must stay with anyone who requires
   access to the aircraft and is not on a list validated by aircrew Courier officer.
5.6. RON with DoD Nuclear-Related Cargo. Every attempt should be made to store cargo on
the aircraft while at a location without nuclear storage capacity or at non-nuclear emergency
divert locations. Transfer custody only to persons according to paragraph 6.3. When DoD
nuclear-related cargo remains aboard overnight the following applies:
      5.6.1. The aircraft will be sealed.
      5.6.2. Type II security will be maintained according DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108, as
      supplemented when required (not required if aircraft is parked in a designated "PL1"
      restricted area, e.g., an AFGSC alert area).
      5.6.3. Only the aircrew (not including the crew chief or MEPs) are authorized unescorted
      access to the aircraft.
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                33


  5.6.4. Security personnel are informed that Type II security material is aboard. Note: Do
  not request security support merely to guard aircrew’s classified mission material.
 34                                                              AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


                                          Chapter 6

                          CUSTODY TRANSFER PROCEDURES

6.1. General. This Chapter expands on Courier requirements and DoD nuclear-related cargo
custody procedures in T.O. 11N-45-51. The Courier is final authority for cargo security, except
during airborne emergencies when the Aircraft Commander rules that safety-of-flight is
paramount. The Courier retains the ultimate authority to accept or deny DoD nuclear-related or
other DOE/NNSA cargo.
6.2. Courier Designation and Certification. Identify Couriers to shippers in writing.
Identification will include the Courier's name, rank, and security clearance. Normally, this
identification is in the Mission Setup Message; however, it may be a separate message sent by
AOC mission planners via email after they validate the information. This may occur when
Couriers are replaced during mission execution. Verify the Courier’s identification by using the
Common Access Card (CAC). Note: "Identification of an Official Courier Letter" (Attachment
4.1.) is for use during border clearance and does not satisfy any of the above requirements.
6.3. Persons Authorized to Sign for Cargo.
   6.3.1. DoD nuclear-related cargo. Each organization that ships or receives DoD nuclear-
   related material is required to publish a list of those persons authorized to sign for cargo
   according to T.O. 11N-45-51 and AFI 21-203. The Courier will have the appropriate
   Certification of Personnel to Receipt for Classified Material letter NLT ten days prior to
   mission execution. If letter changes are required while the mission is en route, the
   organization making the change will fax or email the corrected copy to AOC mission
   planners who will in turn forward to the Courier. Couriers will only release DoD nuclear-
   related cargo to authorized persons.
       6.3.1.1. Identify shipper/receivers by cross-referencing data IAW T.O. 11N-45-51.
   6.3.2. Other DOE/NNSA cargo. The DOE/NNSA publishes a list of people who are
   qualified to sign for DOE/NNSA cargo, called the “DOE/NNSA Authorized
   Recipient/Certification List.” This list of federal agents will be used to authenticate the
   DOE/NNSA convoy personnel. The Courier will have the list NLT ten days prior to mission
   execution. Note: The Field Operations Officer or designee from the Office of Secure
   Transportation (OST) will provide a listing with individual information. For questions
   contact: Office: (505) 845-4180/4448/5071 or STE: (505) 845-4180/6262/4867.
       6.3.2.1. The custody transfer of all other DOE/NNSA cargo will be as follows:
           6.3.2.1.1. CONUS departure with U.S. delivering material to foreign nation:
DOE/NNSA Federal Agent/Representative → Aircrew → DOE/NNSA Federal
Agent/Representative → Receiving Agency
           6.3.2.1.2. OCONUS departure with U.S. recovering material from foreign nation:
Shipping Agency → DOE/NNSA Federal Agent/Representative → Aircrew → DOE/NNSA
Federal Agent/Representative
   6.3.3. The DD Form 1911 will be used for all custody transfers.
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      35


6.4. Courier Responsibilities. The Courier is responsible for receipt, custody, security, safety,
and delivery of DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo to authorized receivers.
Specific responsibilities include:
   6.4.1. Have written instructions that specify DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo
   to be shipped (Mission Setup Message/Airlift Request/Economy Act).
   6.4.2. Have a list of authorized receivers.
   6.4.3. Receive the shipper's briefing.
       6.4.3.1. For DoD nuclear-related cargo missions, the Courier will use applicable portions
       of the AF Form 527B for briefing requirements. DoD shippers may use the AF Form
       527C or a locally developed brief provided all briefing requirements IAW T.O. 11N-45-
       51 are met. If needed, the Courier will contact the shipper via email or phone to clarify
       details.
       6.4.3.2. The Courier and shipper will brief applicable items IAW T.O. 11N-45-51. Any
       questions about forms or cargo will be resolved before accepting cargo.
       6.4.3.3. The Courier will verify that CDS has not been activated on training items that do
       not have sealed command disable panels. If a command disable indicator shows, ensure
       shipper is aware of this condition and the DD Form 1911 is properly annotated.
       6.4.3.4. If the Aircraft Commander and primary mission Loadmaster were not present for
       the shipper and Courier briefing, the Courier will brief them on hazards or nature and
       special handling instructions before loading.
   6.4.4. Before accepting and loading DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo, the
   Courier, shipper, and primary Loadmaster will inspect cargo.
       6.4.4.1. Inspect cargo for general conditions. Check the following as applicable:
       training weapon(s) securely attached to bolster; pressure relief valves; tie-down and
       winching attachments; number and integrity of seals; condition of bolster tires/wheels;
       and condition of casters, wheels, and carrier brakes. Deficiencies affecting safety must
       be corrected before accepting cargo.
       6.4.4.2. Document minor damage, e.g. scratches, scrapes, small dents, etc., in the
       remarks section of the DD Form 1911. Have the shipper initial entry.
       6.4.4.3. Inspect all containers to verify condition of seals. Request the shipper replace
       any broken or missing seals. Have the shipper verify the condition of the seals for
       palletized LLCs. If broken or missing seals cannot be replaced and the integrity of the
       container is suspect, reject the container. If the container is accepted with broken or
       missing seals and the integrity is not suspect, annotate the exact condition on DD Form
       1911.
       6.4.4.4. DoD nuclear-related cargo presented for shipment must be exactly as described
       by the Mission Setup Message and Airlift Request. If cargo differs from the Mission
       Setup Message and Airlift Request, follow procedures IAW paragraph 2.7.3. Serial
       numbers must also agree with those listed on DD Form 1911 and the cargo diplomatic
       clearance approval message, if required.
 36                                                                AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


      6.4.5. Accept custody of nuclear cargo by signing DD Form 1911 and release custody only
      on signature of positively identified authorized receivers or a replacement Courier. Do not
      sign for cargo that the Courier cannot maintain custody of and/or inspect.
6.5. Documentation. Shippers are required to provide properly completed DD Forms 1911.
Instructions for the forms are in T.O. 11N-45-51. On mission termination at home station, return
completed DD Forms 1911 to the squadron/unit and maintain on file for 6 months. DD Forms
1387, Military Shipment Label, are required on LLCs by T.O. 11N-45-51. DD Form 1387-2,
Special Handling Data/Certification, is required on all hazardous cargo not identifiable by a T.O.
11N-20-11 line number.
6.6. Replacement Courier.
   6.6.1. If the Courier must be replaced while a mission is in progress, custody must be
   transferred to either a replacement Courier or a qualified Courier on the crew. The rest of the
   stations to be transited must be notified of the Courier change by message from the
   appropriate CCC or parent wing if the Courier was not previously included in the Mission
   Setup Message.
   6.6.2. If a replacement Courier is not available, duties may be assumed in the following
   order of precedence:
         6.6.2.1. Courier Qualified Extra Pilot. In this case, the mission may proceed to where a
         replacement Courier is available or complete the mission if the additional pilot workload
         will not detract from Courier duties.
         6.6.2.2. Aircraft Commander. As a last resort, use the Aircraft Commander as the
         Courier when it is more important from a security standpoint to move the mission than to
         wait for a replacement Courier. The primary consideration is always cargo security.
   6.6.3. In an aircraft mishap, when the Courier and/or another Courier-qualified crewmember
   cannot perform duties, the highest ranking surviving crewmember automatically will assume
   Courier duties.
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       37


                                           Chapter 7

DOD NUCLEAR-RELATED AND OTHER DOE/NNSA AIRLIFT MISSION SUPPORT

7.1. General. Airlift priority of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) given to DoD nuclear-related and
other DOE/NNSA cargo missions is 1A3 (CJCSI 4120.02C, Assignment of Movement and
Mobility Priority), which is preceded only by presidential support, presidential-approved, and
combat troop support missions. Priorities are used to fill Airlift Requests. All mobility agencies
will support the missions according to the JCS priority. Support will involve all aspects of the
mission, to include security, EOD, maintenance, fuel, aircrew transport, and billeting. Bases that
belong to other MAJCOMs or services fall under AFJI 11-204. It requires base commanders to
establish a written plan or directive to ensure priority support.
7.2. Airlift Support. Bases that support DoD nuclear-related missions will have a written plan
or instruction to support these missions. In addition, plans at bases that regularly receive
requirements to support DoD nuclear-related cargo aircraft will also comply with AFJI 11-204.
7.3. Responsibilities.
   7.3.1. Bases requiring a written instruction or plan to support DoD nuclear-related missions
   will ensure the following is specified:
       7.3.1.1. A single focal point to handle information on the mission.
       7.3.1.2. The base communications procedures to notify the appropriate agencies of an
       inbound aircraft. Bases must be able to respond to a short-notice emergency divert.
       7.3.1.3. Taxi routes and parking spots.
       7.3.1.4. Security force procedures (equipment, response times, etc.).
       7.3.1.5. Priority maintenance and aerial port support.
       7.3.1.6. Priority crew transportation, billeting, and messing.
       7.3.1.7. Fire-fighting support requirements in T.O. 11N-20-11.
       7.3.1.8. EOD procedures (notification, response, equipment).
   7.3.2. The shipper/receiver will be present for shipments and receipts of DoD nuclear-related
   cargo to personally ensure priority support.
   7.3.3. In addition to the support plan, installation commanders will ensure all support
   requirements are coordinated with appropriate base support agencies.
   7.3.4. Commanders of USAFE units in tenant status will arrange priority support with their
   hosts.
7.4. Command and Control. DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo airlift missions
place demands on the command and control system over and above normal operations. AOC
mission planners will ensure a "Y" is in the CLOSE WATCH block. AOC will monitor the
exact status of each mission. Missions executed by an AOC besides 618 AOC (TACC) and/or a
MAJCOM besides AMC should use the equivalent offices of responsibility listed below.
Specific responsibilities are:
 38                                                               AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013


      7.4.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners will maintain ready access to the
      SWOG and the DoD FCG, understand overflight procedures and restrictions, and in
      coordination with tanker planning section, coordinate tanker support, and obtain altitude
      reservation (ALTRV) approvals. Flight planning branch will validate computer flight plans
      (CFP) for compliance with the SWOG and DoD FCG restrictions, EURO Control Route
      availability Document (RAD), ALTRV routings, and avoid heavily populated areas then
      transmit to the current C2 system. Mission planning section confirms diplomatic clearances
      and ensures alternates on CFPs are capable of supporting DoD nuclear-related and other
      DOE/NNSA cargo missions.
   7.4.2. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will mission planners will assist Aircraft Commanders in
   determining the best divert location for a DoD nuclear-related mission. In accordance with
   the Mission Setup Message and this instruction, notify the selected divert location of all
   required support needed to meet the aircraft when it lands. When the Aircraft Commander
   informs the AOC that he or she has selected a different divert location from the one pre-
   coordinated via the Mission Setup Message, the duty controller must then coordinate with the
   new divert location and advise the pre-coordinated divert location it is no longer under
   consideration as a divert option. When time permits, use guidance for mission change
   message IAW paragraph 2.6.
   7.4.3. AMC/A7S and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will actively monitor security status of
   bases that nuclear airlift missions are scheduled to transit. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will
   be prepared to confirm each day's itinerary with Aircraft Commanders when they check in.
   Mission Setup Message will request a support confirmation message be sent from each base
   on the itinerary to appropriate CCC 24-hours before arrival at each base. Use this message to
   confirm security before allowing aircraft to proceed. Only attempt contact with the
   destination base to confirm support via non-secure means if the 24-hour confirmation of
   support message has not been received.
   7.4.4. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planning section will prepare and send mission
   change messages IAW paragraph 2.6. and 4.16.3 after coordination with the Aircraft
   Commander. Check for conflicts with other missions and include hazardous cargo
   information if load is changed.
   7.4.5. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will act as the point of contact between shippers or
   receivers and aircrew during the mission. Pass updates to down line bases as requested by
   the Aircraft Commander.
   7.4.6. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will ensure DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA
   cargo airlift missions delayed for maintenance problems get immediate and priority support.
   7.4.7. AMC Command Center will prepare and submit Operational Report 3 (OPREP-3)
   covering nuclear mission incidents according to paragraph 10.1 and JCS Pub 6.
7.5. Intelligence Support. Intelligence support is an essential element of the mission. It
requires constant attention and adherence to procedures to successfully ensure cargo safety and
security. To ensure DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo missions and aircrews
receive timely threat intelligence information, these procedures will be followed. Missions
executed by an AOC besides 618 AOC (TACC) and/or a MAJCOM besides AMC should use the
equivalent offices of responsibility listed below.
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                   39


  7.5.1. Home Station OSS/IN will:
     7.5.1.1. Monitor planned DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo missions for
     pre-mission intelligence briefing requirements and remain aware of off-station missions
     that could require en route Intelligence support.
     7.5.1.2. Provide pre-mission intelligence briefings to aircrews IAW AFI 14-2(MDS) Vol
     3, MDS-Specific Unit Intelligence Procedures.
         7.5.1.2.1. Intelligence pre-mission briefings will be IAW AFI 14-2C-17, Vol 3, and
         must include the following:
         7.5.1.2.2. Airborne threat from potential hostile countries.
         7.5.1.2.3. Terrorist and sabotage threats.
         7.5.1.2.4. Other activity along route that might impact mission.
         7.5.1.2.5. All source Foreign intelligence collection and criminal threats.
     7.5.1.3. Debrief aircrews on their return as required and report mission results IAW the
     Mobility Intelligence Reporting Directive (MIRD).
  7.5.2. AMC/A2 will provide support IAW AFI 14-2(MDS)Vol 3 and DoD S-5210.41-
  M_AFMAN 31-108. AMC/A2 will:
     7.5.2.1. In coordination with AFOSI 3 FIR, disseminate a DoD nuclear-related or other
     DOE/NNSA cargo mission threat summary message for each DoD nuclear-related or
     other DOE/NNSA cargo mission using the Mission Setup Message addressee list. This
     message will assess the threat levels for each scheduled stop. This message will be
     disseminated no later than 24-hours prior to scheduled mission departure. Lead for
     Intelligence support (OSI or A2) will vary depending on mission itinerary.
     7.5.2.2. Monitor DoD nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo missions worldwide
     and provide intelligence updates and threat warnings to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOZ as
     necessary.

                                  LOGISTICS SUPPORT

8.1. General. This guidance outlines maintenance procedures for aircraft used to carry DoD
nuclear-related and other DOE/NNSA cargo. It applies to all maintenance and operations
personnel who support or conduct DoD nuclear-related cargo airlift missions.
8.2. Aircraft Selection and Preparation. DoD nuclear-related cargo airlift missions are
assigned JCS priority 1A3. Aircraft selected to fly these missions should and be the most
reliable to preclude potential mission delays while the aircraft is in the mobility system.
8.3. General Maintenance and Servicing.
   8.3.1. Fuel servicing guidance for explosive loaded aircraft is contained in T.O. 00-25-172,
   Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. Aircraft should be refueled
   before being loaded with DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo to reduce the
   severity of a mishap. Cargo aircraft loaded with transportation-configured explosives may be
   refueled at aircraft explosive cargo parking areas, commonly called hot cargo pads. (See AFI
   91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, for additional aircraft
   refueling information)
   8.3.2. Aircrew will oversee all maintenance activities on aircraft with DoD nuclear-related
   cargo aboard.
8.4. En route Maintenance.
   8.4.1. Close coordination between MAJCOM CCC, USAFE AMOCC, AOC, maintenance,
   and Aircraft Commander is required at all times.
   8.4.2. The Aircraft Commander's decision is final.
   8.4.3. Use weapon system Minimum Essential Subsystem Listing (MESL) to determine
   status of aircraft. A Maintenance Operations Control (MOC) senior controller will
   personally monitor maintenance support for missions while on their station.
   8.4.4. Maintenance support of JCS 1A3 airlift missions will take precedence over missions
   with lesser priorities.
   8.4.5. When a replacement aircraft is required en route, every effort must be made to select
   an aircraft to meet the criteria in paragraph 8.2.
      8.4.5.1. The aircraft may be selected from the nearest location consistent with mission
      requirements.
      8.4.5.2. Spare aircraft selected from other locations will only be selected after
      coordination with the applicable AOC.
      8.4.5.3. Open discrepancies must not adversely affect or delay a mission.
8.5. Safety Precautions and Personnel Requirements.
   8.5.1. If DoD nuclear-related or other DOE/NNSA cargo is aboard, perform maintenance
   only in the presence of the aircrew, who will ensure proper safety precautions are used. Take
   the following safety precautions, as well as any others deemed necessary:
AFI13-526V3 14 JUNE 2013                                                                    41


     8.5.1.1. Ground aircraft in accordance with MDS specific technical orders and T.O. 00-
     25-172.
     8.5.1.2. Aircraft parking areas must satisfy explosive quantity-distance criteria. Consult
     the local explosive safety officer when in doubt.
