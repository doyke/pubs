Items/Duties.
1. General.
     1.1. Higher headquarters guidance regarding orientation flights is primarily located in AFI
     11-401_USAFESUP_1. This instruction provides additional guidance that is specific to
     orientation flights conducted in 52 FW aircraft at home station and at deployed locations.
     The 52d Operations Group Commander (52 OG/CC) has the primary responsibility for
     overseeing the program. 52d Operations Support Squadron Current Operations Scheduling
     (52 OSS/OSOS) will track and manage the 52 FW Orientation Flight Program. Commanders
     must keep the official United States Air Force (USAF) intent of the Orientation Flight
     Program clearly in mind. These flights are not a right, and the privilege of providing them
     must be protected. It is imperative this program be managed and executed IAW all
     applicable directives and this instruction.
     1.2. The USAF conducts orientation flights to reward and motivate individuals (incentive
     orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding of a particular weapon system and its
     role, or when the flight is determined to be in the best interest of the USAF.
     1.3. 52 OSS/OSOS will track all orientation flights and maintain current listings of personnel
     who have flown and personnel who remain to be flown. 52 OSS/OSOS will maintain annual
     orientation flight records to ensure equitable distribution between all participating units.
     Records that are older than 5 five years are no longer required to be kept.
     1.4. AFI 11-401 defines the four types of orientation flights applicable to the 52 FW:
        1.4.1. Incentive Orientation Flights. Provide a visible reward to military personnel for
        outstanding service and to motivate others to similar performance levels.
        1.4.2. Familiarization Orientation Flights. Familiarize individuals who normally have
        aviation-related responsibilities with aircraft and missions.
        1.4.3. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Flights. Display USAF weapons systems to
        individuals so they can gain a better understanding of the particular aircraft and mission.
        1.4.4. Spouse Orientation Flights. Familiarize military spouses with the unit aircraft and
        mission so as to enhance their understanding of the military member’s role and
        contribution to the USAF mission.
     1.5. Flight surgeons and aerospace physiologists hold aeronautical orders and are not
     covered under this regulation.
2. Incentive Orientation Flight Program.
     2.1. Incentive orientation flights may be flown at home station or at approved deployed
     locations. Incentive orientation sorties executed at deployed locations must be accomplished
     IAW 11-401, USAFESUP_1.
     2.1.1. Names of the intended fliers will be included in the pre-deployment brief. If names
     were not submitted during the pre-deployment brief, then written or electronic coordination
SPANGDAHLEMABI11-401 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              3


   is required to gain 52d FW Commander (52 FW/CC) approval. Reference paragraph 7 for
   request guidance.
   2.2. Annual incentive sorties are dedicated to assigned 52 FW personnel that receive wing
   level annual and quarterly awards and 52 FW/CC approved USAFE level (or higher) annual
   and quarterly award winners who are nominated by their Group CC.
      2.2.1. Annual and quarterly awards that are eligible to receive an incentive orientation
      sortie are the following: 52 FW, USAFE, and USAF annual and quarterly categories:
      Airman, Non-commissioned Officer (NCO), Senior Non-commissioned Officer (SNCO),
      Company Grade Officer (CGO) and First Sergeant (annual only). These members are the
      primary pool of incentive orientation flight candidates.
   2.3. Incentive orientation flights in fighter aircraft will consist of a dedicated, non-tactical
   sortie. Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-specific series for definitions covering air
   combat or surface attack missions.
   2.4. When an incentive orientation sortie is scheduled it takes priority over squadron training
   on the day of execution. The Fighter Squadron (FS) must gain 52 OG/CC approval to cancel
   any incentive sortie.
   2.5. 52 OSS/OSOS is responsible for the equitable distribution of incentive orientation
   flights.
   2.6. Incentive orientation candidates will be required to complete all training outlined in
   paragraph 6.5 of this regulation.
3. Familiarization Orientation Flight Program.
   3.1. Familiarization orientation flights may be flown at home station or at approved
   deployed locations. Familiarization orientation sorties executed at deployed locations must
   be accomplished IAW 11-401_USAFESUP_1.
      3.1.1. Names of the intended fliers will be included in the pre-deployment brief. If
      names were not submitted during the pre-deployment brief, then written or electronic
      coordination is required to gain 52 FW/CC approval. Reference paragraph 7 for request
      guidance.
   3.2. Familiarization orientation flights can occur at anytime during the week as long as it
   does not degrade overall FS training.
   3.3. Fighter familiarization orientation flights should provide the best training opportunity
   possible, while keeping the intent of the familiarization ride in mind. Familiarization
   orientation flights may be performed as a tactical sortie, but the sortie type and G-loading
   encountered should be commensurate with the training goals of the familiarization flier. 480
   FS/CC and the Pilot in Command (PIC) should consider passenger experience and training
   when determining which mission profiles are applicable and appropriate. Consequently,
   Operational Risk Management (ORM) considerations may limit Basic Fighter Maneuvers
   (BFM), Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM), or Aerial Combat Tactics (ACT) familiarization
   flight opportunities. Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-specific series for definitions
   covering air combat or surface attack missions.

        5.2.3. Discretion to allow or not allow 52 FW spouse orientation flights on their aircraft
        relies upon the WG/CC who owns the aircraft.
6. Operating Procedures.
     6.1. Following the announcement of the current annual/quarterly award winners, 52
     OSS/OSOS will create a prioritized list of the 52 FW incentive and familiarization
     orientation fliers. Priority will be given to those individuals with the earliest Date Eligible
     for Return from Overseas (DEROS). 52 OSS/OSOS will notify individuals in order
     beginning with the earliest DEROS. This will be accomplished No Later Than (NLT) the
     week prior to the incentive flight. If an individual is unavailable for the incentive flight, the
     next person on the list will be offered the flight until the slot is filled.
     6.2. Incentive and familiarization orientation fliers’ names for the current week, the
     following week, and the most recent flights accomplished will be reported at the weekly
     scheduling meeting between the OG/CC and the Maintenance Group Commander
     (MXG/CC).
     6.3. No later than Friday of the week prior to the flight, 52 OSS/OSOS will contact the
     orientation flier and the orientation flier’s supervisor via email. This e-mail will provide a
SPANGDAHLEMABI11-401 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           7


  schedule of required events to be accomplished, a map to the locations where the training
  will take place, and Spangdahlem Forms 14, 15, 16, and 17. These four forms must be
  completed in their entirety by the incentive flier prior to the flight.
  6.4. Incentive orientation flights will normally occur on Thursday or on the last fly day of
  the week if Thursday is a no-fly day. Incentive flights can occur on other days at the
  discretion of 52 OG/CC. Operations and maintenance should make every effort to maximize
  D-model aircraft availability on applicable days.
  6.5. Incentive and Familiarization Orientation Flight Training
     6.5.1. All orientation fliers will be required to report to the 52d Medical Group
     Aerospace Medicine Squadron Flight Surgeon’s office in Building 161 at 0700L or
     1300L (during sick call hours) on Monday the week of their incentive flight to
     accomplish a passenger physical. This physical is good for 14 days. Reference Figure 1
     for the training timeline.
     6.5.1.1. Orientation fliers will arrive at Wing Life Support (52 OSS/OSL) in Building
     187 no later than 1400L for Life Support (LS) Equipment Familiarization Training (LL01
     and LL06), Egress Training (LL02), and Emergency Parachute Training (EPT) (SS06).
     This training is only valid for 72 hours. This training will occur weekly and is
     mandatory for individuals to remain eligible to receive their flight.
     6.5.1.2. NLT one day prior to the flight, individuals are to report to the 480 FS Aircrew
     Flight Equipment (480 FS/AFE) for flight equipment fitting. Reference Figure 1 for the
     training timeline.
     6.5.1.3. Incentive and familiarization orientation candidates, if participating in a flight
     that will remain below Flight Level (FL) 180, will receive one-time physiological
     training discussing G-forces, hypoxia, motion sickness and trapped gas issues. This
     training lasts one hour and is to be conducted by either an 52d FW Aerospace
     Physiologist (52 AMDS/SGPT) or Flight Surgeon. Normally, this will be accomplished
     in conjunction with the flighy physical by the Flight Surgeon. If participating in a flight
     that will go above FL180, member must accomplish training IAW paragraph 6.5.1.4 of
     this regulation.
     6.5.1.4. IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, in order to be
     eligible to participate in flights above FL180, all incentive and one-time familiarization
     orientation fliers will be required to be given instruction specific to risks inherent with
     high altitude flight. This training will be instructed by the 52 FW Aerospace Physiology
     Flight. If an Aerospace Physiologist is unavailable at a deployed location, a 52d FW
     Flight Surgeon can serve as a replacement briefer. This training lasts 6 hours and is good
     for 90 days.
     6.5.1.5. IAW AFI 11-403, recurring familiarization candidates require altitude training to
     remain eligible for multiple flights. This requires an actual altitude chamber profile be
     accomplished prior to the second sortie.
     6.5.2. As long as pilots assigned to the 81 FS are current in their annual LS
     Familiarization and Equipment Training (LL01/LL06) and EPT (SS06) they only require
 8                                             SPANGDAHLEMABI11-401 18 AUGUST 2011

        duty desk prior to stepping for the incentive flight.
           6.5.7.1. Operations Supervisors (Top 3) will be the final authorizing individual for
           the orientation flier to accomplish their flight.
           6.5.7.2. 480 FS 1C0(s) will then forward the packet to 52 OSS/OSOS for record
           keeping purposes.
        6.5.8. Orientation pilots will comply with 480 FS security procedures specific to
        orientation passengers.
        6.5.9. 52 OSS/OSOS will monitor each individual’s status until incentive orientation
        flight completion by annotating dates of appointments and scheduled flight. If a
        scheduled incentive flier is unable to complete his/her flight due to maintenance, weather,
        or any other unforeseen factors, the 480 FS will notify 52 OSS/OSOS.
        6.5.10. 52 OSS/OSOS is responsible for notifying all agencies supporting the incentive
        sortie of training dates, times, and locations. This is normally accomplished via the e-
        mail sent to the incentive flight candidate. These agencies include: orientation flier’s
        supervisor, FS Director of Operations (DO), FS Chief of Scheduling, pilot instructor for
        egress training, 52 OSL Superintendent, and the Non Commissioned Officer in Charge
        (NCOIC) of Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) operations.

      6.5.11. If an individual declines to fly without extenuating circumstances (i.e. temporary
      duty, leave, emergency leave, pregnancy), the individual will not be rescheduled. If the
      individual is prevented from participating due to any of the above-listed reasons or the
      FW/CC and/or the OG/CC directs, that individual will be rescheduled for the next
      available incentive sortie.
