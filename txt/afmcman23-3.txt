                                           Chapter 1

                 CATALOGING AND STANDARDIZATION MISSIONS

1.1. Missions. The cataloging and standardization missions are essential elements of the overall
Air Force (AF) logistics system. While satisfying AF requirements, these missions are
conducted in compliance with various Congressional mandates and Department of Defense
(DOD) manuals, e.g., the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Procedures Manual,
DOD 4100.39-M; the Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures Manual, DOD
4120.24-M; the Defense Integrated Materiel Management Manual for Consumable Items, DOD
4140.26-M, and DOD 4140.1-R DOD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation, aimed at
providing for and operating an efficient military supply system.
1.2. Cataloging. AF cataloging operations are conducted within the framework of the Federal
Catalog Program (FCP). Under this program AF, together with the other military services and
civilian agencies of the United States (US) Government, is required to maintain and use a single
uniform cataloging system. For the DOD, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is the
administrator of the FCP and ensures required participation. The Defense Logistics Information
Service (DLIS) is the central operating point for the FCP. DLIS is responsible for releasing FCP
publications and for the processing of item identifications with the related management data.
This includes assignment of all National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and maintenance of a complete
central cataloging file (data bank). This file is identified as part of the Federal Logistics
Information System or the FLIS database, which is resident at the Defense Supply Center
(DSCC) in Columbus, OH. The computerized Federal Catalog System (FCS) is referred to as
―FLIS,‖ and includes item identification and supply information on items repetitively procured
by the Federal Government. DLIS-K is the cataloging agent for the AF and is located in Battle
Creek MI.
   1.2.1. Cataloging Processes. Cataloging of new items and maintenance transactions
   undertaken by Services and Agencies (S/A) result in the comprehensive logistics data Total
   Item Record (TIR) required to identify, requisition, ship, store, dispose, or make other
   logistics decisions related to an item of supply during its lifecycle. This document represents
   internal AF processes that prepare an item for maintenance or initial cataloging. The
   transactional processes listed below were transferred to DLA. While DLA is responsible for
   these processes, the AF is responsible for the technical accuracy of the assignment and to
   challenge erroneously coded or items named incorrectly.
   1.2.2. The Air Logistics Centers (ALC) , the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC),
   and the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC) are responsible for the
   following cataloging processes:
       1.2.2.1. Item Entry Control (IEC). Item entry control is a process where the cataloging
       agent examines potential items for inclusion in the FCP. A determination is made by
       screening the part number (PN) of the candidate item with existing items to see if a
       previously existing item can used in its place. The previously existing item will be
       coordinated with the AF Equipment Specialist (ES) for acceptance.
       1.2.2.2. Technical Data Validation. The process by which the quality of the available
       technical data is confirmed for purposes of Item Name assignment, Federal Supply
 12                                                   AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


       Classification (FSC) determination, Item Entry Control (IEC), special characteristics, and
       the item identification (II).
       1.2.2.3. Provisioning Screening Review and Support. Those actions taken to facilitate
       the best selection, procurement, and cataloging of items of supply required to sustain
       weapons systems and other government requirements (e.g., technical data validation, data
       calls, provisioning, guidance conferences, Logistics Support Analysis conferences, etc.).
       1.2.2.4. Data Entry and Maintenance Transactions. Those actions necessary to ensure
       complete, accurate and current logistics data records (excluding item characteristics data)
       for an item of supply. Cataloging changes may be required because of an item manager
       (IM) or equipment specialist decision/need to establish interchangeability and
       substitutability (I&S) relationships, Item Reduction Study (IRS) decisions, major item
       maintenance, Service catalog management data (CMD) updates, logistics reassignments,
       Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) actions, Defense Inactive Item
       Program             (DIIP),           see          DOD             4140.32-M             at
       http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/414032m.pdf; or disposal actions.
       1.2.2.5. Cataloging Tools. The process of initiating and enhancing documents and
       procedures required to research, record, and organize logistics information.
       1.2.2.6. Item Management Coding (IMC). The process of determining whether items of
       supply qualify for management by the military Services, rather than by DLA or General
       Services Administration (GSA), according to DOD 4140.26-M, Defense Integrated
       Material       Management       Manual        for      Consumable        Items     at
       http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/414026m.htm.
       1.2.2.7. Supply Support Request (SSR) processing. A request by a S/A making them a
       user of a consumable/field repairable item managed by another S/A. These actions are
       outlined in the AFMAN 23-110, USAF Base Supply Manual, at http://www.e-
       publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/afman23-110.pdf.
       1.2.2.8. Data Dissemination. Various products and events provide logistics information
       to customers at every level of the supply system.
       1.2.2.9. Item Name Assignment. Designation of a noun or noun phrase to an item of
       supply that answers the question ―what is it?‖ Based upon subsequently available
       technical data and ongoing tool development, an item name may be refined after stock
       list action. DLIS is ultimately responsible for ensuring the FSC and item name is
       assigned in accordance with DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 3.
1.3. Standardization. AF standardization operations are conducted primarily within the
framework of the Defense Standardization Program (DSP) and in accordance with DOD
4120.24-M, DOD Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures Manual. The
main objectives are to achieve and maintain the highest practicable degree of standardization for
items, materiel, practices, procedures, and terminology by preparing standardization documents.
In addition to participating in the DSP, the AF standardization mission entails the conduct of,
and participation in, various other related programs and projects, including International
Standardization Programs, Non-Government Standards (NGS) Bodies, Parts Control Programs,
and Overpricing Programs.

                         FEDERAL CATALOGING PROGRAM (FCP)

                                            Chapter 3
                     BASIC PRINCIPLES, METHODS, AND TOOLS

3.1. Introduction. The FCP was established in 1952 by Public Law 82-436 (Title 10, US Code,
Chapter 145) to provide complete, accurate, and current item of supply information to support
DOD operational readiness. This chapter provides information on the applicable FCP principles
and concepts, the data system that supports the FCP, and the availability of FCP information.
   3.1.1. The FCP:
       3.1.1.1. Provides a uniform system of II.
       3.1.1.2. Improves the operational effectiveness of DOD components.
       3.1.1.3. Provides a means for monitoring the minimum number of items essential to
       support military operations.
       3.1.1.4. Assembles and maintains a central catalog file.
       3.1.1.5. Prevents duplication of items of supply.
       3.1.1.6. Supports standardization.
       3.1.1.7. Records I&S decisions.
       3.1.1.8. Furnishes supply catalog publications to logistics users.
       3.1.1.9. Promotes optimum interchange of FCP data.
       3.1.1.10. Assists in assuring the highest practical level of systems capability, interface,
       and integration.
   3.1.2. The FCP expanded, from the basic function of establishing II, to include other
   logistics data that supports the disciplines of supply chain management, FSC, and DOD
   logistics management. The AF is a full participant in the FCP and subscribes to its principles
   and concepts.
3.2. Basic Principles.
   3.2.1. Item Identifications (II). Under the FCP, the concept of each item of supply is
   described by an II. The II is made up of data sufficient to establish the essential
   characteristics of the item, which gives it its unique character, makes it what it is, and
   differentiates it from every other item of supply used by the Federal Government.
   3.2.2. Principles of Item Identification. Each II is applicable to one, and only one, item of
   supply. Each item of supply is applicable to one, and only one, II.
   3.2.3. Item of Production and Item of Supply. An item of production consists of one or more
   pieces or objects produced by a manufacturer, which must conform to the same engineering
   drawing or specification. The item of production is assigned a PN by the manufacturer and is
   sold by the manufacturer. On the other hand, the item of supply is purchased by the
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                     15


   government, cataloged by the government, assigned an NSN by the government and supplied
   to government users. An item of supply may be:
       3.2.3.1. A single item of production.
       3.2.3.2. Two or more items of production that are identical in terms of form, fit, and
       function.
       3.2.3.3. A more precise quality-controlled item than a normal item of production.
       3.2.3.4. A modification of a normal item of production.
   3.2.4. The FCP is based upon an item of supply concept, which is government controlled as
   opposed to an item of production concept, which is manufacturer controlled.
3.3. Federal Supply Classification (FSC) System. The FSC System is sufficiently
comprehensive in scope to permit the classification of all items of personal property. In order to
accomplish this, groups and classes have been established for the universe of commodities, with
emphasis on the items known to be in the supply system of the federal government. This
classification system, with its present structure of groups and classes, represents those groupings
and relationships that are based on current, as well as anticipated future, management needs. The
FSC structure of groups and classes is defined in the Cataloging Handbook H2-1, Federal Supply
Classification, Groups and Classes, and H6, Federal Item Name Directory. The H6 includes
Approved Item Names (AIN), colloquial names, FSCs, Condition Codes, Federal Item
Identification Guides (FIIGs), and definitions.
3.4. Procedures.
   3.4.1. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS is the OPR for processing and reviewing all AF initiated
   DD Forms 180, Item Name Collaboration Action Request, and other military S/A initiated
   DD Forms 180 received from the DLIS for coordination.
   3.4.2. Initiating activities will submit a letter requesting the establishment or revision of
   cataloging tools to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS. Supporting data, such as drawings,
   specifications, manufacturer‘s catalogs, etc., will be attached to the letter to assist in the
   revision or development of the cataloging tools. The letter will specify whether the request is
   required for identifying new items of supply or for the revision of existing IIs and provide
   justification for the proposal.
       3.4.2.1. If applicable, the DD Forms 180 will be forwarded to the appropriate AF center
       for their review and input.
       3.4.2.2. Comments and recommendations received from the ALC/AFGLSC will be
       consolidated by the AFGLSC‘s OPR in the 401 SCMS and forwarded to DLIS.
   3.4.3. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS functional OPRs will review each request for new or
   revised cataloging tools, forward copies of the proposed cataloging tools to DLIS, or return
   them to the initiating activity with full justification and what action to take in identifying the
   item of supply involved.

          3.5.2.1.3. Serve as the USAF POC for System Change Requests received from the
          DLIS in support of the FLIS.
   3.5.3. Procedures: DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 3 Development and Maintenance of Item
   Logistics Data Tools, and Volume 4 Item Identification, prescribe specific detailed
   procedures for implementing the FIIG program. DOD and AF manuals and instructions are
   supplemented by detailed operating instructions at each ALC, and the cataloging agent for
   the AF depending upon individual requirements.
3.6. Special Rules Applicable to the Compilation and Publication of the Subsistence
Electronic Catalogs (Foodnet (C8900-SL), NAPA, SPVIA, LSN, and Market Ready

                               PART 3
      PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF ITEM IDENTIFICATIONS (IIS) AND
                           RELATED DATA

                                          Chapter 5
             PREPARATION OF FEDERAL CATALOGING SUBMITTALS

5.1. General. Cataloging actions are processed by the Federal FLIS as a result of inputs
prepared via the D143C or special project and released by the AF cataloging agent, Contractor
ICP‘s, or AFMC data systems. The DOD 4100.39-M, FLIS Procedures Manual, contains
specific formats for each input transaction. FCP transactions fall into two categories:
   5.1.1. Requests to FLIS for NSN assignment on new items of supply entering the inventory.
   5.1.2. Revisions to update data elements and item identifications within FLIS for existing
   NSNs.
5.2. Guidelines for Preparing and Submitting Item Identifications (II) and Revisions.
   5.2.1. The procedures outlined in DOD 4100.39-M, FLIS Procedures Manual are used for
   preparing all new item entries, revisions, and Item Identification Improvements (III), a
   revision to upgrade management data and characteristics information.
   5.2.2. All weapon system and technology group related items will be identified with a
   Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC); a two-position alphabetic code (AA to
   ZZ) authorized to identify specific systems, programs, aggregations of equipment, or an
   activity providing engineering support authority (ESA). See https://d086.wpafb.af.mil/ for
   more information.
   5.2.3. Forward requests for suggested changes to DOD 4100.39-M, special processing of
   data, and other actions not covered by existing procedures to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS.
   Forward requests for revisions to, or establishment of, a new FIIG, a change in FSC,
   reference drawing groups, and item names to the AFGLSC. (See also Chapter 3 of this
   manual.)
5.3. Forms. The following forms apply to various cataloging actions by AF activities:
   5.3.1. AF Forms 86, Requests for Cataloging Data/Action. A hard copy form is used, for a
   small number of AF cataloging requests, when the requested cataloging actions cannot yet
   adequately be identified by submission of a request using the D143C System. While hard
   copy AF Forms 86 are allowed, they are highly discouraged because after they are input into
   the D143C system, the initiator will not get system generated notifications of status (i.e.
   concurrence, non-concurrence, etc.). The preferred electronic method of submitting AF
   Forms 86 into the D143C System will provide automated status of the request to the initiator.
   Special projects may be initiated for mass changes by contacting the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS
   through your local cataloging focal point.
   5.3.2. DD Form 1685, Data Exchange and/or Proposed Revision of Catalog Data. This
   form provides a mechanism for requesting cataloging actions between all S/As. S/A‘s
   cataloging agent may use this form to initiate a NSN item identification or CMD data review
   of an item managed by another S/A. This form is not used by, or to collaborate between the
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 21


   ALCs, Contractor ICPs, or any forward Operating Location (OL) within the AF which is
   detached from the submitter geographically.
5.4. Preparation of Cataloging Actions for Transmittal to the FLIS.
   5.4.1. Federal cataloging submittals are prepared by the responsible cataloging activities, as
   applicable, based on DOD 4100.39-M, FLIS Procedures Manual requirements. D143C is
   programmed to format submittals in the manner prescribed by the FLIS manual.
   5.4.2. Transactions may be input to FLIS by the AF‘s Cataloging Agent through the D143C
   on –line process.
5.5. Obtaining Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Codes. Parts 204, 212, and
252 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) have been amended to
require contractor registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior
to award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket ordering agreement or blanket purchasing
agreement. Just having a CAGE Code alone no longer suffices to qualify a contractor to do
business with DOD.
5.6. Request for Special Processing of Federal Cataloging Submittals. In the event a
significant volume of similar cataloging actions are required, the nature of which warrants
control, group identification, or both, a request submitted to the attention of the AFGLSC‘s 401
SCMS special projects monitor will ensure efficient, timely processing of those cataloging
actions through the D143C data system.
 22                                                  AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


                                          Chapter 6

           NON-DEFINITIVE (ND) NUMBER AND KITS ―K‖ PROCESSING

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance and direction for the assignment of ND numbers
and kits. It defines what ND numbers and kits are and when they are to be used. It defines when
ND numbers must be deleted or stock list action initiated for NSN assignment. The IMCS
D043A/D143C, are the only official, sanctioned sources of entry and storage for AF ND and K
numbers. This chapter assigns responsibilities to the ALCs, AFGLSC, Contractor Supported
Weapon System (CSWS) Programs, 401 SCMS and D143C.
6.2. Definition and Use of Non-Definitive (ND) Control Numbers.
   6.2.1. ND control numbers are assigned by the D143C as the result of an ALC, AFGLSC or
   CSWS activity IM or ES action to:
       6.2.1.1. Identify     items     considered      to       be      non-logical     spares
       (Expendability/Recoverability/ Reparability/Category Code (ERRC Code) ―N‖ only).
       These items are procured on a one-time basis for shipment of assets to support a part
       number requisition (PNR), manufacture, cannibalization, or to show custody in support of
       an operational requirement.
       6.2.1.2. Establish controls within AF systems for one-time buys.
       6.2.1.3. Support special projects authorized by the Non-Definitive Waiver Authority
       (NDWA).
       6.2.1.4. Support non-standard one-time buys in support of a Foreign Military Sales
       (FMS) requirement.
   6.2.2. ND numbers are temporary control numbers, not to exceed one year, and are used for
   asset accountability and visibility. They do not replace NSNs.
   6.2.3. ND numbers cannot be assigned to existing stock listed items.
   6.2.4. ND numbers cannot be included in an Interchangeability and Substitutability Group
   (I&SG) nor can a group be created using ND numbers.
   6.2.5. ND numbers cannot be stocked and stored at the wholesale level, except for local
   manufactured items to support depot maintenance or parts cannibalized from a condemned or
   over-assembled next higher assembly (NHA).
       6.2.5.1. Retail can temporarily stock, store and issue ND numbered items as bench stock
       to support depot maintenance.
       6.2.5.2. If a requirement changes, and an ND numbered item needs to be stocked, stored,
       and issued from supply on a regular basis, the ND one-time buy status will be deleted and
       the appropriate action taken to obtain an NSN for the item.
   6.2.6. An ND number requiring follow-on support will be assigned a NSN, including FMS
   non-standard ND items.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  23


   6.2.7. The ERRC code "N" is the only authorized ERRC code allowed on ND numbers. If
   an ND transitions to an NSN, the ERRC code will be assessed and applied at the time of the
   request for NSN assignment.
   6.2.8. Budget Code ―9‖ is not authorized for use on an ND number. The Budget Code should
   be assigned in accordance with the D043A Data Element Edit Table (DEETS). CSWS will
   continue to assign Budget Code S.
   6.2.9. ND numbers cannot be assigned to Support Equipment (SE). SE must be identified by
   NSNs. Exception: An Air Staff or HQ AFMC downward directed program to procure
   unique SE.
   6.2.10. Retail excess ND-number-identified materiel will be disposed of at the local level
   unless the AF ND Item Manager (NDIM) authorizes shipment to a depot or another location
   with a requirement meeting one of the conditions of paragraph 6.2.1.1
6.3. HQ AFMC ND Policy. HQ AFMC/A4R will establish and maintain ND Number policy
and the ND Unit Check Inspection (UCI).
6.4. Air Logistics Centers (ALCs)/AF Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC) and
Contractor Supported Weapon Systems (CSWS) Programs will:
   6.4.1. Assign ND focal points NDFP/NDWA to approve and fully justify assignment of all
   ND numbers resident in the D143C footprint with release authority, as well as act as the
   NDWA. Note: The NDFP may also act as the NDWA, but the NDIM will never act as the
   NDFP or NDWA.
   6.4.2. Use D143C to establish and control all ND Numbers.
   6.4.3. Authorize assignment of ND numbers to all special projects
   6.4.4. Exercise waiver authority, i.e., respond to a request for a single, longer period - more
   than two 180 day periods – before ND termination or transition to NSN.
   6.4.5. Receive all waiver requests consisting of a written statement documenting the need for
   a waiver to be assigned to an ND number or related group of ND numbers in support of a
   special project. The request must be in writing to the NDWA. The waiver request will
   contain:
       6.4.5.1. All nouns (approved and non-approved item names), CAGE codes, PNs
       associated with the ND number.
       6.4.5.2. A sound justification for requesting the waiver.
       6.4.5.3. The date for completion of the special project and/or expiration date of the
       waiver.
Note: A request without a completion date or stating an ―indeterminate time‖ will be returned to
the requestor and the ND number will be deleted unless the requestor can provide a definitive
date.
   6.4.6. Implement internal control procedures to assure only qualified ND items are assigned
   and retained.
 24                                                  AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


   6.4.7. The assigned NDIM will review all ND numbers present on their D143C workbench,
   on or about the 165-day point and identify, prior to the end of the 180-day cycle, those items
   for:
      6.4.7.1. Possible NSN assignment and the deletion of the ND number.
      6.4.7.2. Extension for an additional 180-day cycle.
   6.4.8. At the time of the first 180 and second 180-day review, NDIM will check D035A for
   open procurement, which is a backorder, asset or requisition. If D035A reflects an open
   procurement during the first 180-day review, the NDIM will direct the users to maintain or
   wavier the ND number. If during the second 180-day review D035A reflects an open
   procurement, the NDIM will proceed with either a request for NSN assignment or an
   extension to the ND by requesting a waiver.
   6.4.9. If a second 180-day cycle is requested, the NDIM will receive notification by the
   D143C to review ND numbers for stock list action. Once notified, the NDIM is required to
   extend, delete or request an NSN for the ND number. This decision is required prior to the
   end of the second 180-day cycle. Failure will result in the deletion of the ND number.
6.5. ND Item Manager will:
   6.5.1. Authorize shipment of retail excess ND number-identified materiel to a depot or
   another location with a requirement meeting one of the conditions of paragraph 6.2.1.1 in
   lieu of disposal at local level. Request NSN assignment using D143C to all ND numbers
   having follow-on support conditions including FMS nonstandard ND items or when the
   requirement for the item is such that it will remain though the failure/demand rate is
   infrequent.
   6.5.2. Review CMD for correct ERRC code while providing NC screen mandatory data.
   6.5.3. Apply corresponding IMC. ERRC codes N and P in this situation may carry IMC L.
   CSWS will continue to apply IMC B.
Note: The NDIM may request NSN assignment or ND termination at any time during the ND
process.
6.6. D143C Process and Control of NDs. D143C is the ―gatekeeper‖ for ND process.
   6.6.1. Prior to ND number assignment, D143C will screen the CAGE/PN to ensure the item
   is not stock listed (NSL) or an ND/NC was not previously assigned.
      6.6.1.1. If the CAGE code and PN is not identified to another ND, NC, or NSN, D143C
      will continue with the ND process.
      6.6.1.2. If the CAGE code and PN is identified to an ND, the D143C will move/forward
      the NDIM to the NC screen to request NSN assignment (based on two different needs
      being made known).
      6.6.1.3. If the CAGE code and PN is identified to an existing NC or NSN, do not assign
      ND.
   6.6.2. D143C will track the ND number and place it on the NDIM's workbench at the 165-
   day mark, prior to first 180 days expiration for review and decision (see paragraph 6.4.7).
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 25


      6.6.2.1. D143C will respond to the NDIM's decision by:
          6.6.2.1.1. Canceling the ND number and notifying the NDFP.
          6.6.2.1.2. Directing the NDIM to the NC processing screens.
          6.6.2.1.3. Forwarding the request to extend the ND for a second and final 180-day
          period to NDFP.
      6.6.2.2. If the NDIM fails to respond to a D143C notification requesting an ND review,
      the D143C will automatically cancel the ND Number notifying D043 and the NDIM.
   6.6.3. If the NDIM requests a second 180-day cycle, D143C will track the ND number and
   place it on the NDIM's workbench before the second and final 180-day period or waiver
   period for the decision to convert to an NSN or cancel the ND. D143C will automatically
   cancel the ND if no response is received. The ND number justification codes are as follows:
      6.6.3.1. A – for shipment of assets to support a mission capable (MICAP)/priority PNR.
      6.6.3.2. B- to support depot manufacture of non-permanent support equipment (jigs,
      etc.).
      6.6.3.3. C- to support depot manufacture/maintenance with special, one-time use
      materiel consumed in the m/m process.
      6.6.3.4. D- for shipment of assets to support a PNR through cannibalization.
      6.6.3.5. E – to show custody in support of an operational requirement and FMS
      (temporary, not to exceed one year).
      6.6.3.6. F – waiver request to show requirements of above situations that require longer
      time frames or special exceptions.
6.7. The ND Waiver Process.
   6.7.1. The ND Waiver Authority (NDWA) will be located in the Provisioning/CATM
   function at each AFGLSC location.
   6.7.2. The NDIM may request a one-time waiver of the one-year time limit of an ND
   number (see paragraph 6.4.4). The NDIM sends the request by most expeditious means to
   the ALC/AFGLSC ND focal point or CSWS NDWA who will review and decide to approve
   or disapprove.
   6.7.3. Within 30 days, the NDWA will approve or disapprove the request on-line and
   coordinate back to the NDFP.
      6.7.3.1. If approved the data fields will be filled in with the Wavier Number (alpha-
      numeric format: NDWyymm0000) and Expiration Date (alphanumeric format:
      dd/mm/yyyy). The NDWA will coordinate the decision back to the NDFP. Reference
      table below for your location assigned control numbers.
      6.7.3.2. If disapproved the NDWA comments will be in the remarks area and will be
      coordinated back to the NDFP, who will coordinate the decision back to the NDIM to
      change the justification code to other than F or take appropriate action based upon the age
      of the ND Number.

Note: At any time in the process, the NDIM may request a waiver of the one-year lifecycle of an
ND Number. The requirement for an item is such that it would be needed longer than the one
year cycle, but not if stocked, stored, and issued policies would require NSN assignment.

HQ AFMC, and D143C. AF policy is defined in AFMAN 23-110, V3, P1, C11.
6.9. Definition and Use of ―K‖ Stock Numbers.
   6.9.1. ―K‖ or kit stock numbers are assigned by the D143C System as the result of an
   ALC/AFGLSC and/CSWS action to:
   6.9.2. Identify items considered kits and used to perform a one-time modification.
   6.9.3. Establish controls within the AF systems, on a temporary basis, for kits that do not
   initially qualify for an NSN, but do require proper control and visibility during their lifecycle.
   6.9.4. ERRC code "T" is the only authorized ERRC code allowed on ―K‖ stock numbers,
   regardless of its true expendability-recoverability-reparability--to emphasize the transient
   nature of a ―K‖ stock number.
   6.9.5. ―K‖ stock numbers are assigned to comply with Time Compliance Technical Orders
   (TCTO) and are given to a group of NSNs within the TCTO kit.
       6.9.5.1. NSNs or part numbered items within that kit are required items to complete the
       TCTO requirements. Note: These items may or may not be cataloged with an NSN, but

     they must have a valid CAGE/Part Number assigned for traceability and configuration
     control.
     6.9.5.2. ―K‖ stock numbers are strictly AF-managed.
     6.9.5.3. Creation and maintenance of the ―K‖ stock number is done through the D143C
     System.
     6.9.5.4. ―K‖ stock numbers are stored in the D043 Family of Systems (FOS) and passed
     downstream to other AF systems.
     6.9.5.5. ―K‖ stock numbers are not recorded into FLIS.
  6.9.6. Kit stock numbers have the following structure:

Figure 6.1. ―K‖ Stock Number Format.




6.10. Responsibilities Concerning Kit or ―K‖ Stock Numbers.
   6.10.1. HQ AFMC/A4R will establish and maintain K (kit) stock number policy.
   6.10.2. ALCs/AFGLSC/CSWS will establish a Kit Manager to control the kit packages.
      6.10.2.1. Once installation of the modification is complete, the Kit Manager will ensure
      the ―K‖ stock number is deleted from D043.
   6.10.2.2. The Kit Manager will implement a control procedure to assure only qualified ―K‖
   stock numbers are assigned and retained.

     6.10.2.3. The Kit Manager will ensure the CMD (specifically the price) is maintained
     and updated as required.
  6.10.3. The D143C System will allow:
     6.10.3.1. Entry of ―K‖ stock numbers with proper structure.
     6.10.3.2. CMD changes through the revision screens.
     6.10.3.3. Logistics transfers of kits from one ALC/AFGLSC unit to another
     ALC/AFGLSC unit. The process is similar to transferring an NSN via the revision
     process in Chapter 9.
     6.10.3.4. Additions to the ―K‖ stock number.

          BASE INITIATED REQUEST FOR CATALOGING DATA/ACTION

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides personnel with instructions for processing the Base
initiated Requests for Cataloging Data/Action (commonly referred to as Base 86 requests). Key
players in the Base 86 process are the cataloging agent for the AF, the ALCs, the AFGLSC,
CSWS, the AFGLSC‘s Provisioning Support Office/Cataloging Managers (PSO/CATM),
Equipment Specialists (ESs), Item Managers, (IMs); special cataloging activities; and individual
Product Directorate monitors. Base activities preparing Requests for Cataloging Data/Action
will follow the instructions provided in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Standard Base
Supply      Customers       Procedures,     V1,    P1,      C     7      (at      http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010107/010107.pdf) and V2,
P2,                         C27                      (at                          http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020227/020227.pdf).
7.2. Definition and Use. Base initiated Requests for Cataloging Data/Action are those requests
prepared and initiated by any AF base, ALC depot supply organization or AF support activity
located jointly at another S/A site. The Request for Cataloging Data/Action, AF Form 86 (or
Base 86) is initiated for the purpose of requesting cataloging action to an existing NSN, or to
request a NSN assignment to an item of supply for which there is a reoccurring demand.
Established Reason Codes and their definitions for Base 86 submittals can be located on Table
7.1 The Request for Cataloging Data/Action is for internal AF use only and is not forwarded to
any other S/A.
   7.2.1. Logistics Readiness Squadrons (LRS) have several methods available for submitting
   Base 86 requests to the cataloging agent for the AF. They are as follows in order of
   preference:
       7.2.1.1. D143C, FLIS Receipt, Edit, and Routing System (FERS). An activity must have
       access to the D043A, Master Item Identification Database, in order to use this method.
       Requests submitted directly to D143C, by the base activity, will reflect the initiator‘s
       name and phone number on the initiator line in the Coordination (COOR) Section of the
       request. Since the initiators of these requests are able to monitor their progress on-line,
       reviewers may use a combination of Remarks (RMKS) and two-digit Message (MSSG)
       and/or Completion Codes to convey information to initiators.
       7.2.1.2. Standard Base Supply System (SBSS)/Mechanical. An activity which doesn‘t
       have D043A/D143C access may use the Standard Base Supply System
       (SBSS)/mechanical method. Requests submitted using this method will be sent to D143C
       via the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN). The initiator line for these requests will
       reflect ―BATCH INITIATED.‖ Reviewers of these requests should take care to provide
       understandable clear text replies using the two-digit MSSG and/or completion codes (
       reference AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, C27, Table 27T-6 at http://www.e-
       publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020227/020227.pdf)rat
       her than RMKS. RMKS can only be viewed on-line, and therefore cannot be viewed by
       these initiators. However, the two-digit MSSG and/or Completion Codes will be sent, via
       AUTODIN, to the originating activity in the form of a BBS reply.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 31


       7.2.1.3. Hardcopy AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action. An activity
       without D043A/D143C access may use the AF Form 86 (long form) to submit a Request
       for Cataloging Data/Action. This form is mailed to the responsible cataloging activity by
       the initiator. When received by the cataloging agent the information from the AF Form
       86 will be loaded manually into the D143C System. The initiator line for these requests
       will reflect activity code ―TU‖ and the name and telephone number of the person who
       entered the information into D143C. As with SBSS/mechanized requests, reviewers
       should take care to provide understandable clear text replies using the two-digit MSSG
       and/or Completion Codes rather than RMKS, since RMKS can only be viewed on-line.
       The two-digit MSSG and/or Completion Codes will be sent, via Defense Switched
       Network (DSN), in the form of a BBS reply, to the originating activity.
   7.2.2. Base-initiated Requests for Cataloging Data/Action are requests only. Final authority
   for approval rests with the responsible ALC/AFGLSC/CSWS, the cataloging agent for AF or
   other AF cataloging activity, depending upon the type of action requested. Requests
   forwarded for ALC review may be approved or disapproved by ALC/AFGLSC personnel.
   The cataloging agent for the AF will submit a DD Form 1685, Data Exchange and/or
   Proposed         Revision       of       Catalog       Data        (see     website       at
   http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd1685.pdf) to the PICA, when
   AF does not have responsibility for the data elements in question.
Note: Only when the item is unique to a CSWS platform will the request be forwarded to the
CSWS activity for review.

                                                    used to question whether or not an item
                                                    should be managed as equipment.
7.3. Determination of Responsible ALC. The cataloging agent for AF will forward base-
initiated Requests for Cataloging Data/Action to the applicable ALC/AFGLSC for processing
based upon the following order of decision.
   7.3.1. For Reason Codes 1, 2, and 6:
          7.3.1.1. ALC/AFGLSC with Technical Order (TO) management responsibility.
          7.3.1.2. ES/SM at an ALC/AFGLSC.
          7.3.1.3. FSC ALC. (Common items or non-weapon system items.)
             7.3.1.3.1. Assignments are located in the D086 website https://d086.wpafb.af.mil/.
             7.3.1.3.2. Includes common items used on more than one weapon system
             7.3.1.3.3. Includes non-weapon system items.
   7.3.2. For Reason Codes 3, 4, 5, and 9: ALC/AFGLSC with management responsibility
   based on the AF Source of Supply (SOS) or Major Organizational Entity (MOE) rule or
   MMAC.
   7.3.3. For Reason Code 8: ALC/AFGLSC with management responsibility based on the AF
   SOS or MOE rule of the valid AF used NSN.
   7.3.4. Items from the AF Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA/SGAL) will be forwarded to
   the ALC/AFGLSC having FSC responsibility (reference D086).
          7.3.4.1. The ALC/AFGLSC will review the request to ascertain whether cataloging
          action is required. If cataloging action is required, the FSC ALC/AFGLSC will initiate
          the applicable action via the D143C or SSR process.
          7.3.4.2. Each ALC/AFGLSC has been assigned a MMAC to support the Air Force
          Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA/SGAL). Assignment to OC-ALC is OM, OO-
          ALC is HM, and WR-ALC is RM.
          7.3.4.3. AFMOA/SGALC will research and review the technical data for the
          ALC/AFGLSC and identify requirements for their Unit Type Code (UTC) /Allowance
          Standard (AS) as requested.
          7.3.4.4. If engineering support is required and the ALC/AFGLSC receives a DLA Form
          339, Request for Engineering Support, AFMOA will work with the ALC to identify a
          suitable substitute or resolve the DLA Form 339 inquiry.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                     33


7.4. Control of Request for Cataloging Data/Action:
   7.4.1. All activities involved in Base 86 processing are permitted 60 days to respond to the
   initiator and are responsible for the control of a timely notification to the initiator, follow-up
   requests, and return of the completed action.
   7.4.2. The ALCs/AFGLSC, the cataloging agent for the AF and those special cataloging
   activities using the D143C system, will manage the Base 86 workload at their organization
   by using the various options available in the D143C System.
       7.4.2.1. The D143C Report Option is used to identify all requests which have had no
       action within the specified timeframe (15, 30, etc., days). Using this option, focal points
       and supervisors will view all Position Codes on a monthly basis.
       7.4.2.2. The D143C Pending/History Files. These files contain records of all requests as
       well as all actions taken against those requests. Open requests may be found by
       searching the D143C Pending file. History files contain all requests closed within the last
       two years. Standardized reply codes, used during Base 86 processing, will be reflected in
       the applicable Pending/History files with the name and phone number of person who
       applied each code. For a complete list of standardized reply codes, reference AFMAN
       23-110,      V2,     P2,     C27,      Table      27T-6            (at     http://www.e-
       publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020227/020227.pdf).
       7.4.2.3. D143C Workbench. The AF cataloging agent in DLIS, the ALC/AFGLSC, and
       special cataloging activities with D143C capability are responsible for monitoring the
       Base 86 workload by accessing/reviewing workbenches located at their activity. All
       workbenches can be viewed by those authorized to do so (focal points, program
       managers, supervisors, etc.) in the D143C System.
7.5. Groups/Squadrons Responsibilities. The Engineering Activity/System                    Manager
(EA/SM) or FSC group/squadron will ensure the following actions are accomplished:
   7.5.1. Receive and assign responsibilities for Base 86 review and subsequent processing to
   the IM and ES. A complete review of all display screens and RMKS in D143C is necessary
   for accurate assignment of IM/ES. These screens may contain additional information added
   by or obtained from the base initiator. Examples of information included on additional
   screens are: end item (E/I), NHA, justification/reason for requested action, additional base
   level POC, item descriptions, and possible substitutable items.
   7.5.2. Determine if an item qualifies as a logical spare. Ensure each logical spare is source
   coded, IMC, and MMAC, as required.
   7.5.3. If the item does not have an NSN, and will be managed by the reviewing
   ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC, ensure a non-cataloged (NC) request is initiated in accordance with
   Chapter 8 of this manual. If the item is retained for AF management, but will be managed
   by another ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC, annotate SMR Code and recommendations and forward
   the Base 86 request to the PSO/CATM at the applicable center. The managing
   ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC will review the request and generate the NC request, reactivation, etc.
   (see paragraph 7.7.3.4). Note: Only when the item is unique to a CSWS platform will the
   request be forwarded to the CSWS activity for review.
 34                                                 AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


   7.5.4. If the item is or will be managed by another S/A, initiate a SSR/Nonconsumable Item
   Materiel Support Request (NIMSR, JLC 17), as required to obtain support for the AF.
   7.5.5. Ensure related AF Form 1000, USAF Suggestion, and Base 86 requests are processed
   simultaneously.
7.6. ES/IM Responsibilities. Review the Base 86 request and approve/disapprove the requested
action. This review consists of one or more of the following steps:
   7.6.1. For Reason Codes 1, 2, 6 and 8: Determine if the item will be managed by
   DLA/GSA, or by the reviewing ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC or another ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC.
   7.6.2. On a Reason Code 1 request, if necessary, recommend FSC review by the AF
   cataloging agent. Note: For Reason Codes 2 through 9, FSC recommendations should be a
   separate decision from the Base 86 request decision. This is because the item is already
   stock listed in the current FSC and the decision to change (or not change) the FSC is often
   dependent upon the decision made on the Base 86 request. An example of this would be a
   request to add AF as a user to an existing NSN. If AF chooses not to become a user of this
   item, FSC assignment is no longer a concern.
   7.6.3. Determine and furnish data, as necessary, for recommended action to be taken. This
   data can consist of information such as: Acquisition Advice Code (AAC), unit price; budget
   code; Quantity Unit Pack (QUP); ERRC code; supply status; fund code; and/or IMC, to make
   an item sufficient for cataloging action. Note: The cataloging agent for the AF is authorized
   to approve and change ERRC code ―N‖ to ERRC code ―U‖ (or vice-versa) on non-weapon
   related items in accordance with paragraph 9.8
   7.6.4. If a request for adoption/reactivation of an existing NSN is approved, process as
   follows:
       7.6.4.1. When an existing AF MOE rule is present, indicating AF is the Primary
       Inventory Control Activity (PICA), without AF CMD, submit an ―XR‖ MSSG Code and
       initiate the appropriate revision request via D143C to add CMD.
       7.6.4.2. When there is another S/A recorded as the Integrated Materiel Manager (IMM)
       and there is an AF Secondary Inventory Control Activity (SICA) MOE rule recorded, but
       no AF CMD, submit an ―XR‖ MSSG Code and initiate the appropriate revision request
       via D143C to add AF CMD.
       7.6.4.3. When there is no MOE rule or active CMD, perform one of the following:
          7.6.4.3.1. If the item is to be AF-managed, submit an ―XR‖ MSSG Code and initiate
          the appropriate revision via D143C.
          7.6.4.3.2. If the item is nonconsumable, to be managed by another service, the
          ALC/AFGLSC will submit an ―XJ‖ MSSG Code and prepare a JLC Form 17,
          Nonconsumable Item Materiel Support Request, and suspend the AF peculiar data in
          D143C.
          7.6.4.3.3. If the item is consumable and will be managed by another S/A, the
          ALC/AFGLSC will prepare AFMC Form 918, Non-Provisioning Item Supply Support
          Request (SSR) Data, if the request is Condition Coded ―1‖ or ―2‖, to initiate a Supply
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                35


         Support Request (SSR) in accordance with DOD 4140.26-M, Chapter 4, Defense
         Integrated Materiel Management Manual for Consumable Items.
         7.6.4.3.4. The ALC/AFGLSC initiating an AFMC Form 918 will annotate the
         D143C control number for reference and tracking by PSO/CATM. Note: The
         AFMC Form 918 is a hardcopy form and the D143C annotation is in an automated
         system; generally they are not received by the PSO/CATM at the same time.
  7.6.5. If a request for NSN assignment is approved (i.e., the item is a logical spare), and
  there is no known NSN, process as follows:
     7.6.5.1. If the item is to be AF-managed, submit an ―XN‖ MSSG Code and submit an
     NC request via D143C (see Chapter 8 of this manual) to initiate NSN assignment. After
     coordination in D143C, forward request and supporting technical data to the
     PSO/CATM. Upon receipt of Notification of Approval (KNA) and NSN, D143C will
     automatically notify the base of the NSN assigned and close the Base 86 request.
     7.6.5.2. If the item is coded IMC ―Z,‖ for DLA or GSA management, the approving
     ALC/AFGLSC or Program Office (PO) should prepare an AFMC Form 918 to initiate an
     SSR. Suspend the AF peculiar data in D143C (ERRC code will be ―N,‖ "U," or "P" per
     paragraph 9.2.2), and forward AFMC Form 918 and the Base 86 to the SSR focal point.
  7.6.6. If a request for NSN assignment indicates the classification is questionable, annotate
  the recommended FSC, MMAC, and justification, as applicable, in RMKS and forward to the
  PSO/CATM for return to the AF cataloging agent in DLIS.
  7.6.7. If a request for NSN assignment is disapproved (item determined not to be a logical
  spare), submit the appropriate two-digit completion code, using the Close (CLOS) option,
  and add a clear text response with reason for disapproval. The disapproving official must
  annotate a clear justification for disapproval.
  7.6.8. If a request for revision to data on an existing NSN is approved (e.g., Change AAC to
  ―D,‖ correct price, etc.), submit an ―XR‖ MSSG Code and submit the appropriate revision
  via D143C.
  7.6.9. When processing actions cannot be accomplished within the allotted time, submit a
  ―PP‖ MSSG Code to provide the base with a new estimated completion date (ECD). Note:
  This does not remove the delinquency status of a Base 86 request; however, it will inform the
  base customer of a delay in processing.
  7.6.10. If a request for NSN assignment is approved, and the interrogation results indicate an
  existing NSN, follow processing instructions in paragraph 7.6.4
  7.6.11. Receive and responds to NIMSRs and SSRs received from the PSO/CATM or
  designated OPR, as applicable.
  7.6.12. If cataloging action is not warranted, use procedures outlined in Chapter 24
  regarding the appropriate response to the initiating activity, using a two-digit Completion
  Code in D143C.
  7.6.13. Once a request has been closed, the AF cataloging agent or the
  ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC focal point may restore it to the Pending file in D143C and request
  further ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC review.
 36                                                   AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


   7.6.14. If D143C reflects a remark indicating that the Request for Cataloging Data/Action
   was submitted as a result of an AF Form 1000, both documents should be processed together.
   The AF cataloging agent will forward the suggestion to the AF Suggestion Office of the
   same ALC that receives the Base 86 for review. An AF Form 1000-1, IDEA Evaluation and
   Transmittal, will be prepared to clear the suggestion, in addition to following established
   Request for Cataloging Data/Action procedures.
   7.6.15. ALC/AFGLSC ESs are required to review and support the AF relative to technical
   decisions for all items that they are assigned responsibilities, whether AF, DLA or other
   service-managed.
       7.6.15.1. Each coordination foot print has 15 days to review the request and approve or
       disapprove. If a review cannot be completed within the 15 day timeframe, valid
       substantiating remarks will be annotated to hold the request on their workbench.
       7.6.15.2. It is the responsibility of the initiator to monitor requests placed in D143C. The
       initiator of a request is responsible for releasing the action to the next reviewer. A
       request placed in the D143C with no action for 15 days will be considered delinquent.
       These delinquencies will be elevated through the ALC/AFGLSC chain of command until
       resolved.
7.7. The     Provisioning      Support      Office/Cataloging  Manager       (PSO/CATM)
Responsibilities. The AFGLSC PSO/CATM serves as the focal point for Base 86 requests
coming from any activity to the ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC. They will also be responsible for
returning requests to the AF cataloging agent. The PSO/CATM is responsible for the following
actions:
   7.7.1. Routing Base 86 requests received from the AF cataloging agent, to the responsible
   group/squadron. If requests indicate technical data is being forwarded the requests should be
   held on the PSO/CATM workbench until data is received. Requests, with RMKS referencing
   a suggestion control number, should be forwarded to the same group/squadron which
   receives the suggestion.
   7.7.2. Converting Base 86 Requests to SSRs using the ―XS‖ MSSG Code and the D169
   System, Supply Support Request Advice System.
   7.7.3. Receiving the Request for Cataloging Data/Action from the group/squadron for
   further processing, as required.
       7.7.3.1. If the requested action is approved, process as follows:
          7.7.3.1.1. Route the new item or revision Request for Cataloging Data/Action to the
          appropriate activity.
          7.7.3.1.2. If another S/A is responsible for the action process as follows:
              7.7.3.1.2.1. For consumable items, input a SSR from the receipt of an AFMC 918
              into the D169 System and submit an ―XS‖ MSSG Code. Follow-up, as required
              and hold requests on the workbench until a response is received from the
              managing activity. Upon receipt of the managing activity's response, take the
              following actions, as applicable:
                  7.7.3.1.2.1.1. If a Positive Action Taken Code (ATC) is received, submit a
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                   37


                 two-digit completion code of ―M_,‖ that corresponds with DLA‘s assigned
                 AAC, using the CLOS option, explaining what action was taken in clear text.
                 Notify the initiating IM/ES of the results, as appropriate. Note: ATCs should
                 not be included as part of the response to the initiator. If clear/precise
                 response cannot be made, submit further explanation to initiator under
                 separate cover.
                 7.7.3.1.2.1.2. If an ATC is not received, submit a two-digit completion code
                 of ―C_‖ (lack of sufficient data) or ―L_‖ (non-concurrence), using the CLOS
                 option, and provide the reason for reject provided by the managing activity.
                 Notify the IM/ES of the results, as appropriate.
             7.7.3.1.2.2. For nonconsumable items, a JLC Form 17 will be completed by the
             approving ES and submitted in accordance with group/squadron procedures.
             Follow-up, as required, and hold prepositioned CMD on workbench until a
             response is received from the managing activity. Upon receipt of the managing
             activity's response:
                 7.7.3.1.2.2.1. If a positive response is received, ensure AF peculiar data has
                 been added to the NSN. Notify the initiating IM/ES of the results.
                 7.7.3.1.2.2.2. If a positive response is not received, notify the IM/ES of
                 reason for non-concurrence.
      7.7.3.2. If the requested action is disapproved, ensure the initiator is advised using a two-
      digit Completion Code and the CLOS option in D143C.
      7.7.3.3. If the IM/ES is recommending reclassification action (Reason Code 1 only),
      return the request to the appropriate cataloging activity with justification and supporting
      technical data.
      7.7.3.4. If the IM/ES is requesting EA/IM review of the item to determine if it is a
      logical spare, forward the request in D143C to the appropriate ALC/AFGLSC. Submit
      RMKS in D143C explaining the reasons another ALC review is required (e.g., end item
      or NHA is managed at different ALC or vice versa).
      7.7.3.5. When there is hardcopy data to go with a Base 86 request, and the request is
      forwarded to another activity, ensure the data is labeled with the corresponding Base 86
      control number and remarks indicating data was sent and how (e.g., Facsimile {FAX},
      mail, E-mail, etc.).
7.8. AF Cataloging Agent Responsibilities.
   7.8.1. The AF cataloging agent will receive all Base 86 requests submitted by assigned FSCs
   (see Standard FSC Table in DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 13, Chapter 2; and Chapter 10 at
   http://www.dlis.dla.mil/flis_procedures.asp for mission unique exceptions). Requests will
   be received on-line in D143C separate from the ALC/AFGLSC for special/mission-unique
   cataloging Activities SH, SJ, SK and SP. For other special/mission-unique cataloging
   activities without D143C access, a hardcopy AF Form 86 may be submitted.
   7.8.2. The AF cataloging agent will suspend hardcopy AF Forms 86 in D143C and include
   all information, including the name and DSN of the initiator, on the input screens.
38                                                   AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


  7.8.3. Review AF Forms 86 for mandatory data elements and attempt to obtain additional
  data from the initiator, as required, and close requests, based on a lack of data. Note: All
  attempts to obtain additional data from the initiator will be documented in the D143C
  system‘s ―RMKS.‖ If telephone contact cannot be made, use the ―XA‖ MSSG Code,
  indicate the type of data required and include cataloging agent‘s DSN phone number in clear
  text. Don‘t use ―RMKS‖ to relay information to the initiator if the request is BATCH or TU
  initiated.
  7.8.4. Verify the accuracy of the FSC/MMAC assigned by the initiator.
  7.8.5. Perform Item Entry Control (IEC).
     7.8.5.1. Determine if an existing NSN and/or suitable substitute NSNs can fulfill the
     requirement.
     7.8.5.2. Determine the impact to existing I&S decisions recorded in the I&S Decision
     Record (ISDR) and D043B, I&S Edit and Suspense System.
  7.8.6. Verify technical and management data.
  7.8.7. Annotate the recommended actions in D143C RMKS.
  7.8.8. If ALC/AFGLSC review/action is warranted, forward request, via D143C, to the
  appropriate ALC/AFGLSC using the Coordination (COOR) option (see paragraph 7.3 for
  order of decision used to determine appropriate (ALC/AFGLSC). Mail, FAX, E-mail, or scan
  hardcopy technical data to the same ALC, enter, in RMKS, how the data was sent, and
  request ALC hold request until technical data is received.
  7.8.9. If ALC/AFGLSC review/action is not warranted, notify the initiator of action taken
  using a two-digit completion (―M_,‖ ―L_,‖ or ―C_‖) or interim (―X_‖) code. Note: The AF
  cataloging agent is authorized to approve and change ERRC code ―N‖ to ERRC code ―U‖ (or
  vice-versa) on non-weapon related items according to paragraph 9.6
  7.8.10. Ensure all clear text messages provided on responses are clear, concise, and self-
  explanatory.
  7.8.11. For requests requiring DD Forms 1685 submittals, submit ―X6‖ Interim MSSG Code
  and hold request on workbench until a response is received from the managing activity.
     7.8.11.1. If the AF cataloging agent agrees with the request, the agent should submit a
     two-digit completion code of ―M_,‖ using the ―CLOS‖ option, explaining what action
     was taken in clear text.
     7.8.11.2. If the AF cataloging agent disagrees with the requested action, the agent should
     submit a two-digit Completion Code of ―C_‖ (lack of sufficient data) or ―L_‖ (non-
     concurrence), using the ―CLOS‖ option, and provide the reason for reject provided by the
     managing activity.
     7.8.11.3. Process and complete all Base 86 requests within the established 60-day
     timeframe (20 days for requests forwarded for ALC/CSWS/AFGLSC review).
     7.8.11.4. If requests are held on an AF cataloging agent‘s workbench longer than 60
     days, due to delays in processing, the initiating activity will be notified of the delay with
     a ―PP‖ MSSG Code and a new expected completion date. Note: This does not remove
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 39


       the delinquency status of a Base 86 request; however, it does inform the base customer of
       a delay in processing.
7.9. Base Responsibilities.
   7.9.1. Prepare and submit Request for Cataloging Data/Action for items that meet the
   following criteria:
       7.9.1.1. There is no known active NSN, base level demands have been established, and
       the item qualifies for inclusion in the FCP in accordance with AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C
       7, Section A.
       7.9.1.2. The NSN is stock listed, but             requires   adoption, reinstatement, or
       correction/addition to data elements.
       7.9.1.3. The ERRC code is in question and the following conditions exist:
          7.9.1.3.1. The existing ERRC code is in conflict with the fourth position of the SMR
          code reflected in the T.O. Note: Equipment Management Code (EMC) is not a
          cataloging data element and cannot be changed by the cataloging activity. Changes to
          EMCs are initiated through the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS)
          in accordance with AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, C27.
          7.9.1.3.2. The Base requests a change from repairable to consumable or consumable
          to repairable.
          7.9.1.3.3. The item is included in a TO, but no SMR code is assigned to the item.
          7.9.1.3.4. The item is not included in a TO.
          7.9.1.3.5. For nuclear ordnance items and other sensitive or security classified items,
          reference       DoD        4100.39-M,        V4,        para        4.12.3.1.       (at
          http://www.dlis.dla.mil/PDFs/Procedures/vol04.pdf).
   7.9.2. Ensure all mandatory data elements are provided on the request (TO, E/I, system,
   demand data, justification, etc.).
   7.9.3. Review "BBS" responses. A "BBS" is a response received by the initiating activity as
   a result of a hardcopy or D143C submittal on a Request for Cataloging Data/Action and
   provides the status of a request. The Completion/Status Codes and the error message output
   on the "BBS" responses are contained in AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, C27, Table 27T-6 (at
   http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020227/020227.pdf).
   7.9.4. Ensure NSL AF assets are reported on a Request for Cataloging Data/Action if not
   reported in any other AF asset (i.e., L and P numbers) reporting system. Random checks will
   be made at frequent intervals by appropriate commands to determine how well this objective
   is being met. Stock control inspection, property audit, or administrative inspection of an
   activity will include a determination of performance against this objective.
7.10. Follow-up for Base Requests. There are three types of Base 86 follow-ups a base can
initiate.
   7.10.1. A mechanized follow-up capability (BZH) is available for use by the bases via
   SBSS. Bases may exercise the follow-up capability if the initial response is not received as
40                                                AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


  early as 30 days from submission date of the request. If an Unmatched (UNMAT) response is
  received from the interrogation and catalog action is still desired, the base must initiate
  another transaction with a new control number.
  7.10.2. Bases may also follow-up by accessing the request in the D143C PENDING
  ACTIONS/HISTORY File where the latest status of the request, all RMKS entered, and the
  name and DSN of each individual involved in the coordination cycle of the request are
  available. On-line follow-ups may be documented by entering information under ―RMKS‖
  indicating that a follow-up was done. If applicable, document the cataloging agent‘s /ALC
  person spoken with, if contacted by phone.
  7.10.3. Bases may also follow-up by sending a message, FAX, or E-mail to the cataloging
  agent or by calling the DLIS HELPLINE (DSN: 661-7766; Commercial 269-961-7766).
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  41


                                           Chapter 8

                                   NEW ITEM REQUESTS

8.1. Purpose. This chapter applies to activities within AFMC, ALCs and AFGLSC. It provides
specific instructions for the preparation, control, and processing of new item requests. Reference
Chapter 10 for additional instructions.
8.2. Control Number Structure.
   8.2.1. New item requests, also referred to as NC numbers, are assigned a Control Number by
   the D143C system. The Control Number consists of the FSC, NC alpha designator, the
   ALC/AFGLSC/CSWS Standard Interservice Agency Serial Control Number (SIASCN),
   which is a six digit serial number) and the MMAC (optional).
   8.2.2. Items of supply that require NSN assignment are initially assigned a SIASCN by
   D143C. The SIASCN is the item control number and considered the NSN until a permanent
   NSN is assigned. All potential AF-managed items of supply which require an NSN will be
   recorded in the D143C. Items selected for NSN assignment come from various source
   documents (e.g., provisioning documentation, Purchase Request/Military Interdepartmental
   Purchase Request (PR/MIPR), Base AF Form 86 Request, Inventory Adjustment Voucher,
   and the like). The IM ensures the required records are established in D143C and submitted
   through the AFGLSC PSO/CATM to the AF cataloging agent (DLIS) within 10 workdays of
   the preparation of AFMC Form 326, Provisioned Item Order (PIO). D143C handles the
   distribution to the individuals pre-identified in the system.
   8.2.3. The activity initiating the NC number is identified by the D143C with a specific alpha
   SIASCN code (see Table 8.1.). The MMAC identifies the IM and ES organization
   responsible for management of the item or weapon system to which the item is peculiar.
8.3. IM and/or ES Responsibilities. Data accuracy is an IM/ES responsibility. When a
requirement for a new item has been determined, the IM or ES at the ALC/AFGLSC will:
   8.3.1. Begin the NC process by inputting the required information into the D143C. D143C‘s
   mandatory fill/blank and compatibility edits ensure data is available to the AF cataloging
   agent and will format the transaction to FLIS.
       8.3.1.1. Identify the Depot Source of Repair (DSOR), the result of the Joint Depot
       Maintenance Program process for all reparable items. See DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 10,
       Table 117, http://www.dlis.dla.mil/flis_procedures.asp.
       8.3.1.2. Identify, if applicable, the MMAC with which the new item is associated. All
       weapon system and technology group related items, for both AF-managed and DLA-
       managed NSNs, may be identified with a MMAC, the activity/office providing
       engineering support authority. Items submitted for GSA management will not contain a
       MMAC.
       8.3.1.3. IMs will ensure provisioned items are coded and reviewed for shelf-life
       considerations. Emphasis should be on identifying and using non-hazardous items and
       longer shelf items, where possible.
 42                                                  AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


      8.3.1.4. IMs will ensure the engineer/equipment specialist performs a criticality
      determination for each new item. Aviation items found to have critical safety
      characteristics and/or processes will be coded as such.
      8.3.1.5. Edit for completeness and accuracy, and release the D143C transaction after all
      information has been validated. The D143C will help in editing for mandatory
      fills/blanks and completeness; however, data accuracy is an IM/ES responsibility.
   8.3.2. Requests for NSN assignment can also be initiated from the D220 facsimile 86 (also
   known as D143C Skeletal Provisioning- D220), or directly from the Provisioning Parts List
   (PPL). The D220 facsimile 86 is received, verified, and annotated by the responsible IM or
   ES prior to being forwarded to the AFGLSC PSO/CATM, and is processed as a Request for
   Cataloging Data/Action. The AFGLSC PSO/CATM, as directed by the group/squadron, can
   generate mechanized Requests for Cataloging Data/Action requesting NSN assignment (NC
   package) directly from the provisioning documents.
   8.3.3. When the source document reflects more than one manufacturer and reference number
   for the same item of supply, the IM or ES will ensure the required information is recorded for
   each PN. If the source document reflects more than five manufacturers and reference
   numbers, the IM or ES will suspend those numbers not included in the original package,
   pending notification of NSN assignment. Upon receipt of the NSN, the IM or ES will
   prepare a D143C input to request the additional reference numbers be added to the assigned
   NSN.
      8.3.3.1. When the source document is a locally prepared purchase description (PD), the
      PD identifying number must be structured as shown in Table 33.1 Also, use Cataloging
      Return Code RT (Table 8.3).
   8.3.4. The IM or ES will forward the request to the PSO/CATM for further processing. A
   technical data package (drawings, manufacturer‘s catalogs, PD, etc.) will be submitted to the
   PSO/CATM office within three days of forwarding the request in support of the cataloging
   request.
8.4. AFGLSC Provisioning Support Office (PSO/CATM) Responsibilities. When an NC
number is received on the D143C workbench, the AFGLSC CATM will:
   8.4.1. Ensure all mandatory data elements are present and correct on the Request for
   Cataloging Data/Action, making ES/IM corrections, as necessary.
      8.4.1.1. Hold NC number request in suspense until technical data is received.
      8.4.1.2. Review technical data for valid PN and CAGE code and ensure all vendor PNs
      on source control and specification control drawings are entered on NC number.
      8.4.1.3. Ensure each vendor on a source control drawing is assigned a separate NC
      number for repairable items, if required.
   8.4.2. Release NC number Request for Cataloging Data/Action to the cataloging agent.
   8.4.3. Prepare receipt letters, by FSC office, attach copy of technical data, and mail to DLIS.
   Retain copy of receipt letter in file.
      8.4.3.1. Receive signed receipt letters from DLIS.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                43


      8.4.3.2. Forward technical data package to DLIS via E-mail to DLISPSO@dla.mil.
   8.4.4. In the case of Accelerated Provisioning Conferences and Resident Integrated Logistics
   Support Activities (RILSA), Provisioners/IM/ES will:
      8.4.4.1. Provide AFGLSC PSO/CATM with technical data for input to D143C System.
      8.4.4.2. Failure to provide documentation will result in either no request for cataloging
      action to the cataloging agent or a J041 error notice.
      8.4.4.3. Adequate technical data (Supplemental Data for Provisioning {SDFP}) was
      previously included in a provisioning package worked and retained by the cataloging
      agent (DLIS will retain SDFP after the provisioning event, awaiting a list of Provisioning
      Line Item Sequence Numbers {PLISNs} identified for AF management.).
      8.4.4.4. The technical data has not been revised since the cataloging agent‘s initial
      review. In addition, all non-provisioning new items require submittal of a technical data
      package.
   8.4.5. If an item managed by a contractor is identified during the provisioning or non-
   provisioning process, the Provisioning Office will immediately contact their local Logistics
   Reassignment (LR) monitor to start the process to reassign the NSN to the AF or DLA.
      8.4.5.1. Local LR monitor will notify the SSM/PO, AFGLSC LR Focal Point and the
      CSWS asset manager IAW AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C2, Section 2C for management
      reassignment.
      8.4.5.2. Coordinate retention of the item with the FSC AFGLSC or begin the
      coordination process to transfer the item to the FSC AFGLSC. Note: If the decision is to
      retain the NSN at the provisioning AFGLSC, the MMAC will be either removed or a new
      MMAC assigned.
8.5. When the provisioning office identifies a requirement for an item assigned to FSG 83,
84, FSCs 9420 or 9430 process as follows. Note: These items will appear on provisioning and
non-provisioning SSRs in the D169. The D169 will compute the requirements. The record will
be retained in the D169 to allow for tracking of the SSR.
      8.5.1. Reference the D043A Bulletin Board for the AFC&TO point of contact. Initiate
      an E-mail to one of the persons listed.
      8.5.2. The E-mail should include CAGE code, PN, FSC, NIIN, technical data, end item
      or next higher assembly, demand data, and CMD.
8.6. Cataloging Agents in DLIS
   8.6.1. Receive the 8A_ inputs on D143C workbench.
   8.6.2. Interrogate the FLIS by CAGEC-PN to determine if an NSN exists prior to processing
   the NC package.

   8.6.3. Ensure all mandatory data elements are present and correct. If not, return to the
   originator with the appropriate 2-position code (see Table 8.3) and remarks, as applicable.
   8.6.4. Check mail code for [M]ailed, [F]axed, [N]one available, [O] for Other.
      8.6.4.1. If required data package is not received/available (by mail, fax, electronically):
          8.6.4.1.1. Contact the AFGLSC PSO/CATM to obtain data packages or additional
          technical documentation required to describe the NC item if not received in 10
          working days.
          8.6.4.1.2. Ensure that an AFMC Form 784, Provisioning Technical Data
          Requirement, has been sent to the manufacturer by the AFGLSC PSO/CATM.
          8.6.4.1.3. If technical data is insufficient for cataloging and a copy of AFMC Form
          784 is not attached to the package (or referenced in D143C‘s RMKS), the DLIS
          cataloging agent will prepare and forward one to the initiating AFGLSC PSO/CATM.
      8.6.4.2. Ensure the PNs on the Request for Cataloging Data/Action/D143C and the
      technical data are compatible and properly screened.
   8.6.5. When an FSC change is required, return to the AFGLSC CATM with verified item
   name, correct FSC, and message added for the IM/ES to update the FSC. When action is
   complete at the ALC/AFGLSC, the request is returned to the cataloging activity.
   8.6.6. Ensure the item management responsibility remains at the ALC/AFGLSC originally
   assigning the NC number. Retention is accomplished by retaining the assigned MMAC.
   8.6.7. Keep appropriate records of actions involving NC numbers.
8.7. Canceling an NC Number.
   8.7.1. Only the responsible IM or ES can cancel an NC number in D143C. This may be the
   result of a DLIS cataloging agent‘s recommendation.
   8.7.2. The DLIS cataloging agent can recommend cancellation by selecting the appropriate
   return code (see Table 8.3) in D143C and returning NC number request to the initiating
   AFGLSC PSO/CATM.
      8.7.2.1. AFGLSC PSO/CATM will review and select appropriate instructions (see Table
      8.4) in D143C for ES concurrence/non-concurrence.
      8.7.2.2. The ES, in concurring, will select appropriate message (see Table 8.5) in D143C
      and coordinate through IM, PROV, and CATM.
      8.7.2.3. The ES, in non-concurring, will select message (see Table 8.5) in D143C and
      provide justification in D143C. The AFGLSC CATM will return NC number to the
      DLIS cataloging agent for continued processing of NSN assignment.
8.8. Substitute NSNs for New Item Requests.
   8.8.1. Responsible cataloging activities may offer a substitute or an interchangeable item for
   a new item request. Whenever a substitute or interchangeable item is offered, the DLIS
   cataloging agent will contact the responsible ES at the initiating ALC/AFGLSC for
   preliminary concurrence.
   8.8.2. The cataloging activity will:

      8.8.2.1. Return the NC request via the D143C System with the appropriate 2-position
      return code (see Table 8.3) to the initiating AFGLSC PSO/CATM.
      8.8.2.2. Add any required PNs to the substitute or interchangeable NSN after the NC
      number is canceled or consolidated.
   8.8.3. PSO/CATM at the initiating ALC/AFGLSC will:
      8.8.3.1. Review NSN recommended by DLIS cataloging agent and select appropriate
      instruction (see Table 8.4) in D143C for action by ES.
      8.8.3.2. Receive action from ES and close NC request for concurrence of substitute
      NSN.
      8.8.3.3. Return NC request to DLIS cataloging agent, with justification from ES, for non-
      concurrence of substitute NSN.
      8.8.3.4. Notify the provisioner of action taken by ES if NC request was a result of a
      provisioning document.
   8.8.4. The ES at the initiating ALC/AFGLSC will:
      8.8.4.1. Review the NSN recommended by the DLIS cataloging agent on the NC request
      in D143C System.
      8.8.4.2. Select the appropriate message (see Table 8.5) in D143C for concurrence of
      substitute NSN.
      8.8.4.3. Initiate an SSR, Nonconsumable Item Materiel Support Request (NIMSR), or
      adoption/ reactivation/reinstatement, as required, to obtain support on substitute NSNs
      which are not AF used.

FA      The FSC on this item was changed. There was a MMAC present on the NC
        number which will be retained with the new FSC. As reflected in the Mission
        Workload Assignment System (D086), the new FSC/MMAC combination is
        valid and no further action is required on your part.

FB      The FSC on this item was changed. There was a MMAC present on the NC
        number which will be retained with the new FSC. D086, the new FSC/MMAC
        combination is not valid and one of the following actions needs to be
        accomplished (1) Delete the MMAC, after coordination with the gaining
        ALC/AFGLSC and transfer the item and its management to the prime FSC
        /AFGLSC; or (2) Submit a request to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS after
        FSC/ALC/AFGLSC coordination to have the FSC/MMAC combination
        approved. This will be sent to the releasing agent at the
        ALC/AFGLSC/AFGLSC for further coordination.

FC      The FSC on this item was changed. There was no MMAC present on the NC
        number and the FSC change will cause an ALC/AFGLSC transfer; therefore, the
        residual MMAC of the original FSC has been added. Per D086, the new
        FSC/MMAC combination is valid and no further action is required on your part.
        Note: Allows residual MMAC to be entered and added to RMKS.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          47


FD   The FSC on this item was changed. There was no MMAC present on the NC
     number and the FSC change will cause an ALC/AFGLSC transfer; therefore, the
     residual MMAC of the original FSC has been added. Per D086, the new
     FSC/MMAC combination is not valid and one of the following actions needs to
     be accomplished (1) Delete the MMAC, after coordination with the gaining

                                            Chapter 9

                           CATALOGING REVISION REQUESTS

9.1. Introduction. This chapter pertains to the processing of additions, changes, and deletions,
which are called maintenance transactions or revisions, to update the IMCS System Suite, i.e.,
D043, D043A, D043B, D046, D071, D155, D169 and FLIS via the D143C. NSN maintenance
requests or ―revisions‖ are primarily initiated by the ALC/AFGLSC IM or ES, an AF base,
another S/A, or CSWS via the D143C System (see Chapter 24). Revisions include, but are not
limited to changes in the following data elements: FSC, Item Name, MOE rule, CAGE code or
PNs, standardization codes, all CMD elements, and characteristics data. If the D143C System is
not available to the initiator, a hardcopy AF Form 86 may be submitted through the AFGLSC
cataloging focal point (CATM). In the event a significant number of revisions requests are
proposed on AF-managed NSNs, the revisions may be handled more efficiently as a special
project through the D143C data system. The initiator should contact the D043 Special Projects
Control Monitor in the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS.
9.2. Director/Materiel Management (DMM) Responsibilities.
   9.2.1. Ensure that Supply Support Requests (SSR) or Nonconsumable Item Materiel Support
   Requests (NIMSR) are prepared and submitted, as required. See DOD 4140.26-M, Defense
   Integrated Materiel Management Manual for Consumable Items, AFMCR 400-21,
   Wholesale Inventory Management and Logistics Support of Multi-Service Used
   Nonconsumable Items (at http://www.dla.mil/j-6/dlmso/elibrary/manuals/joint.asp),
   AFMCI 23-101, Air Force Provisioning Instruction, and AFMCI 23-201, Logistics Materiel
   Control        Activity       Operating        Instruction     (at      http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMCI23-101.pdf).
   9.2.2. When the AF is to be supported by another S/A for consumable items, the following
   CMD elements are automatically suspended in D143C as Preposition Catalog Management
   Data (PPCMD): Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC), ERRC code, fund code,
   budget code, price and Price Validation Code (PVC).
   9.2.3. Reference Chapter 12 for item management coordination and changes.
9.3. IM and ES Responsibilities. It is mandatory for all additions, revisions and deletions to
AF-managed NSNs be routed through the D143C for cataloging actions. It is also mandatory to
use the D143C to route requests on AF ―used‖ (i.e. DLA or other S/A) NSN via the D143C.
Equipment Specialists at the TO or managing (FSC/MMAC) ALC/AFGLSC (SICA) will review
and concur or non-concur on all AF-managed and AF ―used‖ (i.e. DLA or other S/A) NSNs to
determine if a requested action should be accomplished. These requests may be initiated by
another ALC/AFGLSC or CSWS manager and may include but are not limited to CAGE/Part
Number additions, registration of AF on other S/A NSNs, etc. An ALC/AFGLSC IM or ES
initiates or approves the initiation of a revision request when it is determined that some change is
required to the information recorded on the NSN. These changes may consist of additions,
deletions, or changes to existing data. Changes include, but are not limited to, the following data
elements: FSC, item name, MOE rules, CAGE Codes, CMD element(s), I&S, and characteristics
data. The initiator inputs the request into the D143C which is routed the base focal point, (see
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  53


Table 13.1) for release to a cataloger‘s workbench. Supporting technical data or drawing is
required for CAGE, P/N, FSC or nomenclature revisions.
   9.3.1. Initiate revisions in D143C by accessing Option 1 of the main menu. There are
   currently 15 revision categories available in D143C with 18 file maintenance actions
   imbedded in them. Following the on-screen prerequisite information ensures completing the
   requested action with essential coordination. The requested revision will be forwarded to the
   AF cataloging agent.
       9.3.1.1. Control Numbers and a predetermined workbench are automatically assigned
       within the D143C. This allows for process flow to those who "add value" to the
       transaction by immediate electronic transfer once a person completes the required tasks
       within the revision process (see Tables 9.2 through 9.4 for D143C message codes.)
       Continued monitoring of an IM/ES's D143C workbench will allow for quick response in
       case problems arise. The focal point will be responsible for all maintenance in the
       workbench cycle and or assignment.
   9.3.1.2. As an aid to communication, D143C provides Option 7. The IM comment screen is
   available at all times to attach a comment to a NSN, managed or used by the AF.
       9.3.1.3. IMs and ESs should provide supporting data to the CATM immediately after
       D143C initiation of a revision requiring such information. (reference paragraph 9.3.)
       9.3.1.4. The AF cataloging agent has been authorized to approve and submit AF ERRC
       code changes on AF-used items, when the ERRC code is changing from ―N‖ to ―U‖ (or
       vice-versa) on non-weapons related DLA or GSA-managed items (see paragraph 9.6).
       9.3.1.5. Each coordination foot print has 15 days to review the request and approve or
       disapprove. If a review cannot be completed within the 15 day timeframe, valid
       substantiating remarks will be annotated to hold the request on their workbench. It is the
       responsibility of the initiator to monitor requests placed in D143C. The initiator of a
       request is responsible for releasing the action to the next reviewer. A request placed in
       the D143C with no action for 30 days will be considered delinquent. These
       delinquencies will be elevated through the ALC/AFGLSC chain of command until
       resolved.
       9.3.1.6. If a systemic error precludes the submittal of a request through D143C, contact
       your cataloging focal point for assistance.
   9.3.2. Disposal Actions:
       9.3.2.1. The Defense Inactive Item Program (DIIP) will automatically screen and provide
       to the IM a candidate listing for deletion after five (5) years of inactivity. The disposal
       process may be started automatically for those DIIP items coded as delete.
       9.3.2.2. Disposal action is initiated by the IM when the item is no longer required by the
       AF.
       9.3.2.3. A NSN must be in AAC ―V‖ (semi-terminal) status prior to initiating a ―deletion
       of NSN‖ in D143C. The IM and ES will work together to clear all users, SICA, levels,
       financial records, and assets in AF systems prior to changing the AAC to ―Y.‖ Note: It is
       ultimately the IM‘s responsibility to ensure there are no assets and any assets found are
54                                                  AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


     turned-in prior to the AAC change to ―Y.‖ At no time will the AAC be changed to a ―Y‖
     on an NWRM NSN. Reference paragraph 10.4 for procedures specific to NWRM.
         9.3.2.3.1. An IM‘s request to dispose of an item, and change the AAC to ―Y‖ and
         phrase code to ―N‖ in the D143C will trigger a clock in the D043. The D043 will
         retain the item with the AAC ―Y‖ for 52 weeks. On week 52, the SOS will change to
         JCD, D043 outputs a SLC (DIC BMD), deletes the item from D043, and sends a
         delete management to the FLIS. An IM‘s request to make an item disposal will
         remove the AF as a recorded user, unless the item is freeze-coded in the AFEMS, also
         called the ―C001.‖ In this case, the D043 will change the AAC to an "X.‖ Other
         actions (i.e., disposing of assets being reported in AFEMS) must be taken before an
         AAC "X" can be removed and the deletion process continued. For an NSN which is
         freeze-coded, send a letter requesting deletion to 585 CBSS/GBND, 380 Richard Ray
         Blvd, Warner Robins AFB, GA 31098-1683 (FAX DSN 468-2207). Before a
         disposal action can be accomplished, freeze-code removal must be processed through
         AFEMS. The 585 CBSS/GBND personnel will review AFEMS to determine whether
         assets are still being reported.
         9.3.2.3.2. If the item is in an I&S relationship, the PICA will review the I&S group,
         remove the item from the group, and change the relationships within the group (See
         Chapter 36).
         9.3.2.3.3. Disposal actions when AF is PICA. If the item is in support of another S/A
         (S/A), the AFGLSC/ALC will coordinate the delete action or a logistics reassignment
         with all SICAs (see Chapter 12).
  9.3.3. Actions Which Cannot Be Accomplished Using the D143C system.
     9.3.3.1. Changes to prices/costs related to Materiel Support Division (MSD) items
     (identified by Budget Code ―8,‖ Fund Code ―SF‖) cannot be changed using D143C.
     These must be done in D200N, Recoverable Item Stratification. However, other-funded
     items may have their price changed using D143C. The ALC/AFGLSC focal point should
     contact the 401 SCMS/GUMB for transactions the D143C does not allow. This includes,
     but is not limited to cancel-dup, cancel-use, cancel-invalid, LRs when NSNs are included
     in an I&S group, I&S group Master NSN replacement, and when an LMX transaction is
     required to change other data elements within an I&S group.
     9.3.3.2. The Acquisition Method Code (AMC) and Acquisition Method Suffix Code
     (AMSC) can be changed using the Purchase Request Process System (PRPS) D203.
     Note: D143C cannot be used for changes to these elements.
     9.3.3.3. FLIS back-outs of any effective-dated transactions will be forwarded to the
     AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS.
  9.3.4. ALC/AFGLSC IMs are required to review the Catalog Management Notifications for
  the items that they are assigned management responsibilities.
  9.3.5. ALC/AFGLSC ESs are required to review and support the AF relative to technical
  decisions for the items that they are assigned responsibilities, to include, but not limited to
  AF, other service or DLA-managed items.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                55


   9.3.6. Batch requests of 25 NSNs or more may be initiated by contacting your local
   AFGLSC Cataloging focal point. The Cataloging Focal Point will request a special project
   through the 401 SCMS.
9.4. Provisioning Support Office (PSO/CATM (Cataloging Manager)) Responsibilities.
   9.4.1. Review or prepare Requests for Cataloging Data/Action, as required.
   9.4.2. Interrogate D143C to ascertain the status of Requests for Cataloging Data/Actions (see
   Table 9.3 for D143C message codes.)
   9.4.3. Forward supporting/technical data, provided by the IM/ES, to the responsible
   cataloging activity immediately after release of a revision.
9.5. DEMIL Challenges.
   9.5.1. The ES will assign the applicable DEMIL code to each item that they are responsible.
   9.5.2. The ES will respond to all DEMIL challenges received from the DEMIL Coding
   Management Office (DCMO) within 90 days in accordance with AFMAN 23-110, V6, C7.
   Failure to respond to the DCMO challenge within the 90 days may result in the assignment of
   a FLIS DEMIL Integrity Code (DIC) 1, 3, 6, or 7 which will ―lock out‖ any attempts to
   change the DEMIL Code. Per DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Table 216 states:
      9.5.2.1. DIC 1 - DEMIL code reviewed; recommended DIC adopted by ICP, or no DIC
      change recommended.
      9.5.2.2. DIC 3 - Critical FSC/FSG MIL or sensitive CCLI; requires mutilation
      worldwide.
      9.5.2.3. DIC 6 - Non-critical FSC/FSG MIL or non-Sensitive CCLI; requires mutilation
      worldwide.
      9.5.2.4. DIC 7 - Forced concurrence; DCMO has forced a DIC change due to an ICP
      non-response over 90 days old.
   9.5.3. To enable a change to the DEMIL, when a FLIS DIC 1, 3, 6, or 7 has been assigned
   the ES will:
      9.5.3.1. Initiate a revision request in the D143C requesting the DEMIL code change. In
      the ―RMKS‖ of D143C, include the justification and the tech data for the change in
      accordance with the DOD 4160.21-M-1. Note: Care should be taken when assigning the
      DEMIL ensuring it is compatible with the Controlled Item Inventory Code, (CIIC).
      9.5.3.2. The DCMO will review the ES justification and either agree or not agree with
      the change. If the DCMO agrees with the change, their office will lift the FLIS DIC and
      process the DEMIL change. If the DCMO disagrees, they will contact the requestor for
      resolution.
9.6. Catalog Actions for DLA-Managed Items.
   9.6.1. This policy applies to all individuals in AFMC (ALC/AFGLSC) whenever a catalog
   change, to include P/N and CAGEC, is required on a DLA-managed item. The ES will be
   responsible for making changes via the D143C as a result of the DLA Form 339 review.
   When DLA routes a DLA Form 339 to the recorded SICA ES and the SICA ES finds that the
 56                                                   AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


   engineering responsibilities should be reassigned to another location and the gaining SICA
   ES has concurred, the following actions are required.
       9.6.1.1. The gaining ESA engineer is responsible for requesting all cataloging actions
       through their ES.
       9.6.1.2. The gaining ESA will coordinate via the D143C and assign the appropriate
       SICA ES coding (MOE rule, MMAC, etc.).
       9.6.1.3. The gaining SICA ES will include the applicable division designator and ensure
       the applicable ES code is assigned and identified in the D143C request in accordance
       with AFMAN 23-110.
       9.6.1.4. The gaining SICA ES will initiate the ―SICA‖ logistics reassignment action in
       the D143C.
       9.6.1.5. The losing SICA ES will coordinate and return the request to the LOGR focal
       point. When no ES is assigned, the LOGR focal point will research and attempt to locate
       an ES manager to evaluate and coordinate on the D143C SICA logistics reassignment,
       making the coordination complete.
   9.6.2. When the assigned SICA ESA or the ES determines a change is necessary, the ES will
   initiate the D143C action.
9.7. Cataloging Activity Responsibilities.
   9.7.1. Access D143C to obtain cataloging revision requests.
       9.7.1.1. The AF cataloging agent, as a result of IM/ES instructions, may perform the
       necessary actions to complete the requested revision within the policy and procedural
       guidelines and systems' edits of the AF systems and FLIS. This should include, but may
       not be limited to, a total item review to verify that the change being requested will result
       in the most complete, accurate, and current cataloging data available (See Table 9.2 and
       Table 9.4 for NIIN message codes.)
       9.7.1.2. Use any forms of communication available, including the Remarks option
       (RMKS) in D143C, to verify the intent of the request if any questions arise or a potential
       conflict with policy and procedure would occur.
   9.7.2. Receive hardcopy AF Form 86 revisions, with supporting data, from the CATM at the
   ALCs. Perform necessary actions to complete the requested revision within the policy and
   procedural guidelines and the systems' edits of the catalog. This should include, but may not
   be limited to, a total item review to verify that the change being requested will result in the
   most complete, accurate, and current cataloging data available.
   9.7.3. Receive and respond to all challenges to alleged invalid or non-collaborated logistics
   actions affecting the catalog (e.g., FSC changes, CIIC, reassignments, and the like).
9.8. HQ AFMC ERRC Code Policy for Non-Weapon Related DLA or GSA-Managed
NSNs.
   9.8.1. The AF ERRC code is an AF peculiar data element and must be determined by the AF
   regardless of which Service, Agency or CSWS is recorded as the PICA. Only the AF
   cataloging agent has the authority to change an ERRC code ―N‖ to a ERRC code ―U‖ (or
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             57


   vice-versa) on a non-weapon NSN. This policy applies only to DLA or GSA-managed
   NSNs, which are not components of service-managed (AF or other service)
   equipment/systems which currently reflect ERRC codes ―N‖ or ―U.‖ All other ERRC code
   decisions will be directed to the appropriate ALC/AFGLSC focal point. This policy does not
   include changes to or from any other ERRC code. Prior to assigning a ERRC code ―C‖ to an
   NSN, the ES will review AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C19 (at http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010119/010119.pdf)             to
   ensure the ERRC code ―C‖ is appropriate for Serialized Control and Reporting System
   (SCARS).
   9.8.2. The AF cataloging agent will:
       9.8.2.1. Assign an ERRC code monitor to approve/disapprove all base-initiated ERRC
       code reviews for NSNs falling within the parameters outlined above in paragraph 9.7.1
       9.8.2.2. Work with the AF‘s Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), to resolve and clarify
       unprecedented decisions.
       9.8.2.3. Notify the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS of problems that arise as a result of or
       concerning this policy.
   9.8.3. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will:
       9.8.3.1. Have the final say on all unprecedented decisions.
       9.8.3.2. Reserve the right to reverse decisions at any time.
   9.8.4. The ALC/AFGLSC technical community will determine the ERRC code on all AF-
   used NSNs in addition to all weapon system items managed by another S/A.

*Cataloging transactions are processed by the AF cataloging agent using the D143C.
   10.2.2. The AF cataloging agent receives requests for stock list actions or cataloging
   management data from the ALC/AFGLSC as well as mission-unique or special cataloging
   activities as indicated by the ―*‖ in Table 10.1 and Table 10.2 Requests are processed by
   designated cataloging technicians using the D143C or are submitted directly from personnel
   assigned the FSGs/FSCs listed for each activity.
   10.2.3. These activities are responsible for submitting transactions for the following:
        10.2.3.1. Item Identification data.
        10.2.3.2. MOE rule data.
           10.2.3.2.1. When submitting MOE rule actions, these activities will be recorded as
           either the PICA or SICA. When the AF is to be supported by another S/A, requests
           will be processed according to Chapter 9 and Chapter 12 of this manual.
           10.2.3.2.2. If another AF activity is currently recorded on the item, support will be
           obtained from the AF activity recorded as the PICA or SICA.
        10.2.3.3. Reference number data. Activity Code SJ manages all AF items with a CAGE
        Code of 98230.
        10.2.3.4. Standardization decision. Input by the activity recorded in the SD-1,
        Standardization Directory, with Item Reduction Study (IRS) program responsibility for
        the FSC.
        10.2.3.5. Cataloging Management Data (CMD).
           10.2.3.5.1. FSG 89 will have no AF management data. Data on the Integrated
           Materiel Management (IMM) line will apply.
           10.2.3.5.2. Activity TT cataloging management data is automatically-generated by
           FLIS as outlined in DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 6, Supply Management, Appendix 6-2-
           D Part 3 and will not be displayed in the D043. Note: Special activities cannot
           submit FLIS Segment G, freight data.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               63


10.3. D143C Processing Procedures.
   10.3.1. Assignment and control of non-cataloged NC, ND, and kit (K) numbers.
      10.3.1.1. Activities SH, SJ, and SP may establish NC requests for stock list actions, ND
      one-time buys, and K kit numbers in D143C System (see Chapter 6 and Chapter 8).
          10.3.1.1.1. All actions are routed through D143C for editing and forwarding to the
          IMCS, D043. Activity ST will file and maintain AF SICA NSNs in D143C.
          10.3.1.1.2. Actions failing to pass the D143C edits are returned to the initiator for
          correction and re-submittal.
          10.3.1.1.3. Once an NC number is established, revision to the CMD recorded in
          Master Item Identification Data Base (MIIDB), D043A System, is not authorized
          until the NSN is assigned.
   10.3.2. Other Processing.
      10.3.2.1. Activities SK, SR, and TT do not have D143C capability.
      10.3.2.2. Mission unique and special activities will establish the controls necessary to
      ensure the timely processing of the request.
      10.3.2.3. If review of the Request for Cataloging Data/Action reveals the items are
      improperly routed, the activity will determine the correct FSC and forward the request to
      the responsible activity.
   10.3.3. Cataloging Management Data (CMD).
      10.3.3.1. In addition to the responsibility for the initial recording of CMD and other
      information, activities are also responsible for file maintenance of AF data on all items
      that are managed by them and for the management data on all items they may be the
      SICA.
      10.3.3.2. Upon processing the initial recording or change to established CMD by the
      IMM or lead service, FLIS will notify these activities by DIC ―KIM.‖ These activities,
      upon receipt of the ―KIM,‖ will record or change the AF CMD, as required.
   10.3.4. Each activity will perform the following:
      10.3.4.1. Standardization I&S review.
      10.3.4.2. Review and resubmit returns or rejects from FLIS, IMM, or Lead Service, if
      required.
      10.3.4.3. Submit recommended cataloging changes, by letter or Data Exchange and/or
      Proposed Revision of Catalog Data, DD Form 1685, to other AF activities.
10.4. Nuclear Cataloging Requests. Reference AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C19.
   10.4.1. Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Activity SK, MMAC WK NSNs or
   classified NSNs with MMACs MW, NB or NP are managed as AF MILSPARES in the
   Nuclear Item Management And Cataloging System (NIMACS) and visible in the D043. All
   others will be cataloged in the D043 and the FLIS.

     10.4.1.1. IMs responsible for management data will submit their request via the D143C
     for documentation and control.
         10.4.1.1.1. The Recoverable Item Movement Coding (RIMC)/‖Ship to‖ address will
         be reviewed whenever a change to the CIIC is requested. Reference AFMAN 23-
         110, V3, P3, C28 for RIMC policy.
         10.4.1.1.2. For NSNs managed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA),
         IMs     will    submit  an     E-mail     to    afnwc.lg@kirtland.af.mil and
         dtra.noco@abq.dtra.mil indicating a required change.
         10.4.1.1.3. IMs will monitor D043 until the change is visible. Once visible, the
         requested action in D143C may be finalized and sent to history.
  10.4.2. It is forbidden to change the AAC on a NWRM NSN from a stocked/non-stocked
  condition to a ―Y.‖
     10.4.2.1. For obsolete NSNs, the IM will change the AAC to ―V.‖
     10.4.2.2. The IM will perform an annual review of all items with AAC ―V‖ identifying
     asset position, to include installs.
     10.4.2.3. If the IM determines the AAC ―Y‖ is warranted, the request to change the AAC
     to ―Y‖ must be coordinated through and approved by the AFNWC/LG.
  10.4.3. The CIIC for unclassified NWRM NSNs will be coded the letter ―O‖ and, in most
  instances, with a DEMIL ―F.‖
  10.4.4. If the NSN is visible on the list of NSNs designated NWRM, the item name will
  reflect NWRM in the first four positions of the item name. The remaining positions will
  reflect the manufacturer‘s name.
  10.4.5. All NSN-numbered nuclear ordnance items will be recorded in the FLIS data base.
  The FLIS data base maintained at DLIS for each such item will be limited to a single
  reference number and a single CAGE Code which must be 57991, 67991, 77991, or 87991.
  The CAGE code will be used for all AF special design items, end items, assemblies,
  components, and parts (including testing and handling equipment) designed or manufactured
  by the AF, or designed controlled by the AF, for use specifically in the nuclear ordnance
  field. They may be security classified or non-security classified (reference Chapter 11),
  classified in FSG 11 or both.
  10.4.6. The IM will ensure the correct Serialized Report Code (SRC) is maintained via the
  D143C (reference Table 10.3 for appropriate code).
  10.4.7. A NWRM indicator code will be assigned by DOD to all NSNs on the NWRM list
  approved by HAF. The information can be viewed in the A increment of D043A (reference
  Table 10.4).
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           65

        SECURITY CLASSIFIED CATALOG DATA/CRYPTOLOGICAL ITEMS

11.1. Methods of Physical Security Classification. Three methods of Physical Security
Classification are used in the USAF supply system. These methods do not represent the security
classification of the catalog entry but refer to the physical item and are used, as appropriate,
when submitting catalog data for items which require safeguarding.
    11.1.1. Method 1. DOD CIICs, authorized by the FLIS Procedures Manual, DOD 4100.39-
    M, Volume 10, Chapter 4, Table 61, are as listed below:

Table 11.1. DOD Controlled Inventory Item Codes (CIIC)

    11.1.2. Method 2. CIICs, authorized by DOD 4100.39-M, FLIS Procedures Manual and
    assigned by the Department of Energy (DOE) or its contractors are used on all forms and in
    publications specifically related to nuclear ordnance items, regardless of the degree of
    security, as listed in Table 11.2 The DTRA classification codes appear in the C1100-ML/IL-
    AF (WK) USAF Federal Supply Catalog covering nuclear ordnance.
    11.1.3. Method 3. CIICs authorized by DOD 4100.39-M, FLIS Procedures Manual and
    assigned to USAF/ESC, are used on all forms and publications specifically related to
    cryptologic items, regardless of the degree of security. Cryptologic item data for the
    Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG) items with MMACs of CI, CS, CA, CE, KC, SM, XU,
    or ZG appear in the D043.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 67

Codes, refer to DOD 4100.39-M, FLIS Procedures Manual, Volume10, Chapter 4, Table 61.
11.2. Procedures. To ensure uniform submittal and processing of security classification data,
including direct submittal of such data to DLIS for NSN assignment, the following procedures
supplement normal operating procedures are:
   11.2.1. Appropriate AFMC supply catalog data transmittal forms, transmitting IIs containing
   security classified information, and data to be published in C1100-ML/IL-AF(WK), are
   prepared and submitted as prescribed for other catalog data, except that all activities must
   comply with AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, other security
   directives, and the DOD 4100.39-M, FLIS Procedures Manual.
   11.2.2. In other than the nuclear area, IIs containing security classified information will be
   prepared using the reference method (Type 2) or the partial descriptive method (Type 4, 4A,
   or 4B II format). All security-classified data is omitted from these IIs. When necessary,
   changes to the name of the item are made to preclude compromise of security classified
   information.
   11.2.3. When the item identification (II), described by using the reference method or Types
   4, 4A, or 4B II format, becomes declassified, the responsible activity will initiate action to
   change the type of II to Type 1, 1A, or 1B, as applicable.

 DD FORM 1685 AND JLC FORMS 17 AND 19 COLLABORATION/COORDINATION

12.1. General. This chapter contains procedures for processing DD Forms 1685, Data
Exchange and/or Proposed Revision of Catalog Data, guidance for processing letters, messages,
and telephone requests when collaboration is required, and the cataloging and standardization
impact of JLC Form 17, Nonconsumable Item Materiel Support Request (NIMSR); and JLC
Form 19, PICA/SICA Management Level Change and/or Reassignment Request.
12.2. Processing DD Forms 1685.
   12.2.1. The DLIS uses the DD Form 1685 to coordinate additions, changes, or deletions of
   data elements, characteristics data, reference numbers, FSCs, etc. Collaboration is
   accomplished according to DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 2, Chapter 2 of the FLIS Procedures
   Manual. The DD Form 1685 will never be used for logistics reassignments.
   12.2.2. The AF cataloging agent in DLIS uses the DD Form 1685 when requesting
   collaboration under circumstances referenced in paragraph 12.1 with other Service/DLA.
   DLIS will suspense, control, and process all DD Forms 1685 initiated by them and any
   another S/A. (The ALCs/AFGLSC will not use or respond to this form.) Communication
   concerning collaboration issues between the ALCs and the AF cataloging agent will be by
   letter, message, E-mail, and/or D143C. When an ALC needs to communicate its needs for
   nonconsumable item materiel support, logistics reassignment, or PICA/SICA management
   level changes to another S/A (e.g., FAA and NWS), refer to the instructions below.
12.3. Processing JLC Forms 17 and 19.
   12.3.1. ALC/AFGLSC Responsibility.
       12.3.1.1. The Interservice Focal points at each ALC/AFGLSC will process and control
       all NIMSRs, PICA/SICA Management Level Changes (i.e., NIMSC), and/or Logistics
       Reassignment Requests via JLC Forms 17 and 19 submitted by other S/As (e.g., FAA
       and NWS). Note: Only the ALC/AFGLSC has authorization to process or initiate these
       forms within the AF. Though the result may be a cataloging action, the AF cataloging
       agent in DLIS is not involved in the control, coordination, or processing of these forms.
       12.3.1.2. The AF IM will position (suspend) the CMD in D143C (main menu option 1,
       secondary menu option 8) when the JLC Form 17 is sent through the JLC Form 17/19
       focal point to the PICA.
       12.3.1.3. ALC/AFGLSC will use the JLC Form 17 for nonconsumable items when:
          12.3.1.3.1. Collaborating, coordinating, or requesting a MOE rule addition between
          services. Note: Once the addition is recorded, the NIMSR will not be used to obtain
          follow-on support.
       12.3.1.4. ALC/AFGLSC will use the JLC Form 19 for items of supply when:
          12.3.1.4.1. Recommending the transfer of PICA responsibilities between S/As and or
          any changes to management level data (logistics reassignments). Note: If the AF is to
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              69


          become the PICA, process according to Chapter 9 of this manual after collaboration
          with all SICAs and system managers.
          12.3.1.4.2. Requesting a change to an item from consumable to nonconsumable or
          nonconsumable to consumable.
          12.3.1.4.3. Collaborating or requesting the deletion of MOE rule data between
          Services. With ALC/AFGLSC approval, the AF cataloging agent may submit a MOE
          rule delete action for an AF SICA MOE rule when the PICA activity does not
          respond to the JLC Form 19 by changing the AAC to ―Y‖ in D143C.
          12.3.1.4.4. Requesting or proposing management level changes.
12.4. The AF Cataloging Agent Responsibilities.
   12.4.1. When collaboration or coordination of JLC Forms 17 and 19 are complete,
   cataloging actions are processed according to DOD 4100.39-M, FLIS Procedures Manual
   and Chapter 6-Chapter 10 of this manual.
   12.4.2. Other service-initiated JLC Forms 17 and 19 received by the AF cataloging agent
   will be forwarded to the applicable ALC/AFGLSC Interservice focal point for processing.
12.5. Intra-Air Force Logistics Reassignment for Air Force SICA NSNs.
   12.5.1. If another S/A is the PICA and an intra-AF logistics transfer is required between
   ALCs, the losing ALC will collaborate with the gaining ALC via E-mail, letter, or the like.
   12.5.2. Upon concurrence from the gaining ALC, the losing ALC will position (suspend) the
   CMD in D143C.

                                          Chapter 13

 PRIORITY SYSTEM FOR OBTAINING NATIONAL STOCK NUMBERS (NSN) AND
     PRIORITY STOCKLIST CHANGES (PSLC) OF AF-MANAGED ITEMS.

13.1. Priority FLIS Processing. Priority indicator codes are used by the FLIS to expedite NSN
assignment. DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 10, Chapter 4, Table 24, FLIS Procedures Manual,
contains these codes, which define how fast FLIS reacts to a cataloging request.
13.2. Priority System for Obtaining NSNs. Note that there is a small or limited time
differential in the actual FLIS processing time between the various priority codes. When an
NSN is needed in an emergency, particular attention will be given to the handling of Requests
for Cataloging Data/Action. In expediting priority NSN assignments between the IM/ALC focal
point, the responsible AF cataloging agent focal point, and cataloging office, the transmittal of
the Request for Cataloging Data/Action data can be accomplished by priority message, E-mail,
or facsimile depending on the urgency of the required NSN. The AF cataloging agent will use
the D143C data system to accomplish this requirement; hence, maintaining record management
and control. No other data system or procedure will be used.
13.3. PSLC of AF-Managed Items.
   13.3.1. When an IM determines that logistical support is being seriously jeopardized due to
   erroneous catalog data, an expeditious revision, using the PSLC method, may be submitted
   through the ALC focal point assigned in the PSO/CATM. The ALC/AFGLSC focal point for
   PSLCs will notify the 401 SCMS if there are changes to the PSLC POC.
   13.3.2. Any request requiring an immediate change can be submitted as a PSLC through the
   D143C system only, unless the NSN has an ERRC code N‖ or ―P ―and the request is
   submitted in Oct or Nov during the annual surcharge pricing update blackout. Data elements
   in FLIS segments A, B, C, E, H, or V may be updated including Unit of Issue (U/I), but
   excluding the item pricing structure for the MSD items and changing the AAC to ―Y‖ of an
   item of supply. An 8C1-T transaction must be submitted through D143C by the Materiel
   Management Team.
   13.3.3. The ALC focal point will submit these requests to the 401 SCMS, identifying the
   NSN, specific data element change(s) required, and the assigned control number. If the
   number of NSNs requiring stock list changes exceeds 25, submit requests by E-mail or
   facsimile to the 401 SCMS special project monitor. Major revisions may require more (and
   specific) information. For example, when the change request is for an ERRC code change or
   reactivation, the related SOS, AAC, Fund Code, U/I, Budget Code, Unit Price, MMAC,
   PVC, and MOE rule must also be submitted.
13.4. PSLC for Other S/A-Managed Items.
   13.4.1. The CMD on NSNs managed by another S/A will be forwarded to the AFGLSC
   PSLC monitor for review.
   13.4.2. The AFGLSC monitor will forward emergencies to the DLIS focal as indicated on
   Table 13.1.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                       71


   13.4.3. Request for DLA emergency NSN assignments or reinstatement actions will be
   processed through the PSO.

  NSN ASSIGNMENT BEFORE ACCEPTING DELIVERY & SHIPMENT WITHOUT
                              NSN

14.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes responsibilities for identifying items of supply in the
FCP before delivery to USAF activities.
14.2. Policy. NSN assignment will be completed prior to shipment by a contractor. AF policy
for identifying and cataloging items of supply entering the AF inventory is contained in AFMAN
23-110, V1, P1, C 7, Section A. If in the interest of effective supply support, an item(s) needs to
be shipped prior to receiving an NSN the item(s) may be shipped under the assigned NC number.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               73


                                        Chapter 15

                          FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS)

15.1. Purpose.
   15.1.1. The requirement to perform cataloging functions for the FMS program is driven by
   the USAF‘s obligation to provide logistics support for all items and configurations which
   have been sold through USAF FMS programs as directed by AFMAN 16-101, International
   Affairs and Security Assistance Management. The following items are exceptions as USAF
   follow-on support obligations:
      15.1.1.1. Items which have been altered or re-engineered by an FMS purchaser.
      15.1.1.2. Items or systems may be specifically excluded from USAF follow-on support
      by the original sales agreement which is called the ―Letter of Offer and Acceptance.‖
      Note: Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the director, Defense Security
      Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
   15.1.2. The execution of the above requires the USAF to continuously provide many items
   of supply to foreign countries which are not supplied to USAF operating bases. Some of
   these items may have other S/A users and managers. The purpose of this chapter is to
   mandate and describe the creation of cataloging records which facilitate the efficient
   automated processing and control of USAF FMS requisitions, procurements, billings, and
   case management.
   15.1.3. This chapter introduces the concept of FMS sponsorship. USAF FMS sponsorship of
   a foreign country on an NSN is indicated by the recording of a unique MOE rule in Segment
   B of FLIS per DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 13, Materiel Management Decision Rule Tables.
   There are two general categories of FMS sponsorship. These categories are FMS PICA
   sponsorship and SICA sponsorship, each of which assigns specific responsibilities to the
   USAF.
      15.1.3.1. FMS PICA Sponsorship.
          15.1.3.1.1. The recording of a USAF FMS PICA MOE rule on an NSN establishes
          USAF as the responsible procuring service for FMS requirements. Inherent in this
          responsibility is USAF‘s obligation to receive and process FMS requisitions received
          directly from foreign countries.
          15.1.3.1.2. The recording of a USAF FMS PICA MOE rule on an NSN indicates that
          an inventory of that NSN is not established and is not replenished if a residual
          inventory already exists because of previous AF use.
             15.1.3.1.2.1. If an item is initially procured and cataloged because of an FMS
             requirement, an ALC inventory is not established.
             15.1.3.1.2.2. If a AF-managed standard item (i.e., DOD used) becomes obsolete
             to DOD, but continues as an FMS requirement, USAF FMS PICA sponsorship is
             assigned. Inventories of such items are not disposed of, nor are they replenished.
             Requisitions for such items will be satisfied from existing stock until exhausted.
             Subsequent requisitions will be satisfied by new procurements, repair of
 74                                                   AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


              reparables, or reclamation.
       15.1.3.2. FMS SICA Sponsorship.
          15.1.3.2.1. The recording of a USAF FMS SICA MOE rule on an NSN establishes
          the USAF as having an FMS interest in the item; that is, the USAF receives FMS
          requisitions for the item. It also indicates that another DOD activity is responsible for
          supporting USAF FMS requirements. The USAF is responsible for passing foreign
          country requisitions to the IMM or lead service, and for recording such transactions.
          15.1.3.2.2. The recording of a USAF FMS SICA MOE rule on an NSN indicates that
          the USAF does not establish an inventory of that item.
15.2. Applicability. These policies and procedures are applicable to those organizations
participating in the normal cycle of processing items and systems under an FMS program, which
include, but are not limited to the ALC, HQ AFMC, AFGLSC, DLIS – AF Cataloging Agent
(AFCA) and Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC).
15.3. Impacted Data Systems. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS and the 754 ELSG perform
modifications, as required, to the following logistics data systems to accommodate the concept
and support the required data interface between DLIS, AFMC, contractors, and FMS country
participants:
   15.3.1. Acquisition and Due-In System (ADIS) (J041).
   15.3.2. FLIS Edit and Routing System (FERS) (D143C).
   15.3.3. Automated Intersite Gateway (AISG) (M024B).
   15.3.4. Base Account Screening Exercise System (BASES) (D046).
   15.3.5. Item Management Control System (IMCS) (D043).
   15.3.6. Master Item Identification Data Base System (MIIDB) (D043A).
   15.3.7. Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS) (W001).
   15.3.8. Item Manager Wholesale Requisition Process (IMWRP) (D035A).
   15.3.9. Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) (D071).
   15.3.10. Suspense and Control System (SACS) (D036).
15.4. Policy and Procedures. The FCP identifies items, which are of interest to the AF because
of FMS commitments. These items may be standard or nonstandard.
   15.4.1. Standard Item. In the FMS environment, ―standard‖ identifies an item that is
   managed and used by DOD.
       15.4.1.1. AF-Managed NSNs (Consumable/Nonconsumable). If a recurring FMS
       requirement exists, the recording of appropriate foreign country MOE rules is required.
       This will be accomplished centrally by AFSAC based on requisitions recorded in the
       SAMIS. Although the ALC does not have the responsibility to record these foreign
       country MOE rules on established NSNs, as a contingency capability only, the Document
       Identifier Code 8C2-G or 8C1-C/8C2-C transaction may be used to record them on AF-
       managed NSNs only. FMS countries are not required to obtain MOE rule registration
       prior to requisitioning items from the USAF inventory. The SAMIS edits against FMS
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            75


     requisitions prior to passing them to the D035A System for support. To preclude an
     excessive drain of USAF assets by FMS countries, SAMIS codes requisitions as
     programmed or non-programmed based on an Eligible to be Programmed Quantity
     (EPQ). Programmed requisitions contain a ―D‖ in record position 30 with a ―1‖ in record
     position 72, while non-programmed requisitions contain a ―D‖ in record position 30 with
     an alpha, 2, or a blank in record position 72.
     15.4.1.2. Other S/A-Managed NSNs (Consumable/Nonconsumable), AF-Used. When an
     FMS requirement exists, the recording of foreign country MOE rules is required. This
     will be accomplished centrally at AFSAC based on requisitions recorded on SAMIS.
     Note: FMS requisitions, originating from other Services, will be processed according to
     AFMCR 400-21, (also published as AFLCR 400-21) paragraph 5-9.c.(2), Wholesale
     Inventory Management and Logistics Support of Multi-Service Used Nonconsumable
     Items.
     15.4.1.3. Other S/A-managed NSNs, Excluding Coast Guard and Federal Aviation
     Administration (FAA) (Consumable/Nonconsumable), Not AF Used. When an FMS
     requirement exists, the System Program Manager (SPM) ALC will first determine the
     subsystem in which the item is contained. The ALC that manages or would manage that
     subsystem is responsible for submitting the appropriate AF FMS SICA sponsor MOE
     rule (i.e., F2KZ, FCL2, FHD2). The FMS SICA sponsor MOE rule selected will reflect
     the level of authority (LOA) compatible with the managing S/A LOA. A review of
     Segment B of the FLIS TIR is required to make this determination. AF FMS SICA
     sponsor MOE rules will be submitted by the appropriate subsystem manager ALC, to
     DLIS, using the 8A1-B transaction. CMD will reflect that which is recorded in Segment
     H of the TIR by the IMM or lead service with the exception of AAC and AF peculiar data
     ERRC code, fund, and budget codes). AF peculiar data does not necessarily have to align
     with the PICA‘s data; however, the data will be consistent with standard AF coding.
     Unless the PICA‘s AACs are ―F‖ or ―L,‖ AF will apply AAC ―P‖ to its FMS items (LOA
     ―99‖). If the PICA AAC is ―F‖ or ―L,‖ AF will use the same code. For FMS requisitions,
     originating from other services, see paragraph 15.4.1.2 Note.
     15.4.1.4. Coast Guard or FAA-managed NSNs (Consumable/Nonconsumable), Not AF
     Used. Neither the Coast Guard nor the FAA supports AF FMS sponsorship requirements.
     The registration of an FMS requirement on a Coast Guard or FAA NSN requires an ALC
     generated 8A1-B transaction using the applicable LOA 99 USAF FMS PICA MOE rule
     (i.e., FMSG). The recording of foreign country MOE rules will be accomplished
     centrally by AFSAC based upon data recorded in SAMIS. For FMS requisitions,
     originating from other services, see paragraph 15.4.1.2 Note.
  15.4.2. Nonstandard Items. In the FMS environment, ―nonstandard‖ describes an item that
  is not stocked in the DOD inventory nor procured for regular use by the DOD.
     15.4.2.1. Non-cataloged (NC) Numbers:
        15.4.2.1.1. NC numbers will be assigned to nonstandard items when an NSN
        assignment is required. The ALC and AFSAC use its unique FMS PICA MOE rule,
        SOS, and MMAC as shown in Table 15.1
76                                                AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


        15.4.2.1.2. NC numbers are processed in the same manner as standard items with the
        exception that once the stock number is assigned, DLIS will forward the item to the
        appropriate cataloging agent for registration of the foreign country MOE rules. DLIS
        will prepare the item identification (II), and register the AF FMS MOE rule.
        15.4.2.1.3. Standard NC data, input into the D143C System, will be used; i.e., 8A1,
        8A2, 8A3, 8A4, and 8A5. See Chapter 8 of this manual. It is mandatory that the
        ALCs indicate, on the 8A5 format, the foreign country MOE rules and complete FMS
        case designators (Master Case Designator Code and Sub Case/Line Item Code). Both
        the ALC and AFSAC will require application data and an indication of availability or
        non-availability of technical data.
        15.4.2.1.4. When several foreign country MOE rules are submitted for user
        registration on an NC package, DLIS prorates cataloging costs among the supported
        countries to ensure equitable cost sharing. DLIS will forward the cataloging cost
        information to its billing agent, Defense Reutilization Marketing Services (DRMS),
        for preparation of SF Form 1080, Voucher for Transfers Between Appropriations
        and/or Funds. When a foreign country is recorded as a user, subsequent to NSN
        assignment, it is required to pay only the cost of the addition of its MOE rule.
        15.4.2.1.5. Substitute Items. Refer to Chapter 8, paragraph 8.7
     15.4.2.2. Non-definitive (ND) Numbers. The use of ND numbers on nonstandard items
     (PNs) for one time procurement is authorized; however, if a follow-on support
     requirement through FMS is known or anticipated, the country is required to establish an
     FMS case for NSN assignment and MOE rule registration. The ALC will request ND
     waivers and will delete these ND numbers as soon as all actions are completed (i.e.,
     shipment, delivery, billing, etc). See Chapter 8 of this manual for completion actions.
     15.4.2.3. Initial Spares Part Number Listing. Periodically, the ALCs will receive
     contractor listings for initial spares that contain only the CAGE code and PN. Review of
     these items may reveal items that are used in subsystems managed by other ALCs. The
     ALC in possession of the listing will collaborate, in writing, with the ALC that manages
     the subsystem and furnish the listing and available technical data. This will enable the
     ALC IM for the subsystem to initiate cataloging action.
     15.4.2.4. NSNs - Foreign Registration only. If an ALC is aware of an FMS requirement
     for a nonstandard item, that ALC is responsible for determining subsystem application.
     If the subsystem is managed by the determining ALC, that ALC will establish their LOA
     99 FMS PICA sponsor MOE rule (i.e., FMSG) and appropriate CMD via an 8A1-B
     transaction into D143C. If the determination is made that the item is applicable to a
     subsystem that is managed, or would be managed, by another ALC, the transferring
     ALC/Directorate of Materiel Management (DMM) will notify the receiving ALC/DMM,
     in writing, of the NSN, PN, and TO figure and index numbers. The receiving ALC will
     validate subsystem application and assume management responsibility by recording their
     LOA 99 FMS PICA sponsor MOE rule (i.e., FMSG) and establishing appropriate CMD
     records.
     15.4.2.5. NSNs - CMD. Establishment and maintenance of CMD on NSNs with FMS
     sponsor MOE rules is required. Normal file maintenance for CMD changes, as reflected
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           77


     in Chapter 9, applies (i.e., 8C1 for NSNs and ND numbers). All CMD establishment
     and maintenance in FLIS, for items citing LOA 99, are for AF service line of CMD only
     (Maintenance Action Code ―SS‖), with a 0-60 day future effective date. See Chapter 9
     for format.
  15.4.3. Conversion of FMS Items. Prompt MOE rule and CMD changes will be made to
  items as their status changes, i.e., FMS nonstandard (no DOD requirement) to standard
  (DOD requirement) and from standard to FMS nonstandard.
     15.4.3.1. In either situation, the ALC will submit an 8A1/8C1 transaction requesting
     MOE rule change and CMD realignment.
     15.4.3.2. When an item, which was originally cataloged with the FMS PICA sponsor
     MOE rule (i.e., FMSX), becomes required for use by the AF, the MOE rule will be
     converted to a standard AF PICA MOE rule (LOA 06 or 22, i.e., FXX5, FXX4). The AF
     management data will be added to the NSN, as well as the appropriate foreign country
     MOE rule(s) (i.e., YS01, ZK01).
     15.4.3.3. When an item, which was originally cataloged with the FMS PICA sponsor
     MOE rule (i.e., FMSG) becomes required for AF use, and is subsequently item
     management coded to Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the ALC will submit a
     ―Condition 2‖ Supply Support Request (SSR) to the appropriate DLA center. The
     ―Condition 2‖ SSR indicates the NSN is not presently active. The ALC will provide the
     new MOE rule, indicating the residual Federal Supply Class (FSC) ALC, DLA center
     (i.e., FSC 6110 = FXGG), and anticipated requirements. When an ALC is recorded as
     FMS SICA sponsor, and the item becomes required for AF use, an SSR will be submitted
     to the managing S/A reflecting the MOE rule of the residual FSC ALC along with
     projected requirements.
     15.4.3.4. The USAF will not support another service requirement if the USAF is
     recorded as FMS PICA sponsor (i.e., FMSG) only. The AF is procuring the item to
     satisfy FMS requirements and will not adopt and manage an item to support another
     service.
     15.4.3.5. When another service (with exception of the Coast Guard and FAA) requires an
     item of which AF is the FMS PICA sponsor, the AF IM will notify the other service IM
     to assume management of the item and support the AF FMS requirement. The USAF will
     supply the appropriate FMS SICA sponsor MOE rule to the supporting service. Note:
     When the AF is recorded as an FMS PICA sponsor (LOA 99), Coast Guard is recorded
     with an LOA 26 MOE rule.
     15.4.3.6. When the other service has only an FMS requirement for an item for which the
     AF is recorded as the FMS PICA only, the other service will apply its own FMS PICA
     sponsorship (LOA 99) to that item. Each service is authorized to manage its own FMS
     requirement with a LOA 99 MOE rule. No centralized DOD Manager is assigned for an
     NSN when only FMS requirements are involved.
     15.4.3.7. When the AF has a requirement for an item on which another service is
     recorded as FMS PICA sponsor only, the AF will assume management responsibility and
     support the other service‘s FMS requirement.
78                                                  AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


     15.4.3.8. When the AF has an FMS only requirement for an item that another service is
     recorded as the FMS PICA sponsor, then the AF will establish its own FMS PICA
     sponsorship (LOA 99).
     15.4.3.9. AF Requisitions for FMS NSNs.
         15.4.3.9.1. If an AF base, after thorough research, determines that an FMS
         nonstandard item may be a logical spare for AF use, that base may submit a request
         for ALC support by:
            15.4.3.9.1.1. Off-line PNRs. This request is submitted to the sponsoring ALC by
            FAX in Military Standard Requisition and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) format.
            Because the Defense Automated Addressing System (DAAS) has an edit to reject
            requisitions to NSNs which are identified with AAC ―P‖ (FMS), these requests
            must be forwarded off-line. The guidance in AFMAN 23-110, V1, P2, C2; V3,
            P3, C16 ; and P4, C2, applies to the preparation of these requests. The bases will
            provide full justification, which includes TO figure and index, to support their
            request.
            15.4.3.9.1.2. DD Form 1348-6 (Non-NSN Requisition). Submit DD Form 1348-
            6, DOD Single Line Item Requisition System Document, prepared per USAF
            Supply Manual, AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C25 and P2, C2, to the sponsoring
            ALC. This form will be fully completed before forwarding.
         15.4.3.9.2. Concurrent with their off-line PNR or DD Form 1348-6 submittal, AF
         bases are encouraged to submit a Request for Cataloging Data/Action, prepared per
         AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C7 and V2, P2, C27, to: DLIS, 74 Washington Avenue N.,
         Suite 7, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084, requesting AF adoption of the NSNs. Full
         justification will be provided. This justification includes TO figure and index. If
         none exists as on some non-aircraft type items, cite type of item, application, and the
         impact on the mission if the items are not adopted for AF use. DLIS will process and
         forward these requests to the applicable ALCs for technical review.
  15.4.4. Funding. Cataloging and standardization tasks, initiated by the ALC and performed
  by DLIS, are to be accomplished by manpower (personnel equivalents) funded by the FMS
  administrative surcharge budget as opposed to FMS case funds. No special billing procedure
  is required as this is considered normal FMS support. Cataloging actions which do not
  involve NSN assignment or MOE rule registration (by DLIS-SBA) are not case funded.
  Routine DLIS actions include updating CMD or transferring item management responsibility
  from one ALC to another. DLIS is reimbursed for its services by FMS case funds.
  15.4.5. Logistics Reassignments. When it is determined that a logistics management transfer
  must be made between ALCs, the losing ALC will officially notify the gaining ALC by
  letter. The losing ALC will cite all available data, and obtain branch level approval. The
  gaining ALC will validate and submit the request for MOE rule change and CMD
  realignment through D143C. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C7. Disagreements on item
  management will be referred to HQ AFMC/A8.
  15.4.6. Directorate of Nuclear Weapons Management (Activity SC). Special FMS
  sponsorship MOE rules have not been established due to their limited involvement in FMS.
  ND numbers will be assigned to items anticipated as ―a-one-time-buy.‖ If recurring demands
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             79


   are anticipated, NSNs will be assigned utilizing standard coding with the exception of the

      REQUEST FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (HAZMAT) IDENTIFICATION

16.1. Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Identification. Identification is in accordance with
DLAD 4145.41, DoD 4100.39-M, Vol 10, Table 179 and AFI 24-210(IP), Package of Hazardous
Materiels.
16.2. Publication of Hazard Classification Data. Hazard classification data is not included in
the FEDLOG or SNUD, D071 System, stock list changes. Therefore, users, handlers, and
transportation components must consult the Hazardous Materials Information Resource System
(HMIRS) for hazard classification and/or other related information pertaining to hazardous
materials.
16.3. Hazardous Materials Indicator Code (HMIC), which is based upon the Materiel
Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is derived from the (HMIRS). DLA owns this information and the
HMIC is a systematically entered value based on the availability of information (the MSDS) in
HMIRS.
16.4. Responsibility. The Program Office and the Chief Engineer are responsible for
identifying hazardous materials. Brooks AFB is the POC for any item that may be hazardous.
Contact Brooks Safety and Health, USAFSAM/OEHT, DSN 240-5447, E-mail
hmirsaf@dla.mil or http://www.dlis.dla.mil/hmirs/. If Brooks verifies an item is hazardous,
they will enter information in HMIRS, which will systematically drive the HMIC change.

                                          Chapter 17

 USAF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL SUPPLY CLASSIFICATION (FSC)
AND USAF MATERIEL MANAGEMENT AGGREGATION CODIFICATION (MMAC)

17.1. Purpose and Scope of the FSC and MMAC.
   17.1.1. The FSC is designed to serve multiple functions of logistics management and permit
   a uniform classification of all items of supply used by military departments, civilian agencies
   of the government, and participating North American Treaty Organization (NATO)
   countries. Basic principles and federal rules as they apply to designating the FSC of an item
   of supply are in Federal Supply Classification, Groups and Classes, Cataloging Handbook
   H2-1; FSC Numeric Index of Classes, Cataloging Handbook H2-2; Federal Item Name
   Directory, Cataloging Handbook H6; and DOD 4100.39-M, Volume 4, Chapter 2.
   17.1.2. The USAF MMAC System is an auxiliary classification tool, which permits a
   broader commodity classification detail than provided under the rules of the FCP, but it must
   be restricted to intradepartmental usage and transactions. Use of MMAC is authorized by
   and must be used in accordance with the D086 Mission Workload Assignment System
   database at https://d086.wpafb.af.mil/.
17.2. Responsibilities.
   17.2.1. HQ AFMC‘s AFGLSC/401 SCMS will:
       17.2.1.1. Manage the FSC program within the AF.
       17.2.1.2. Provide a USAF representative to the FCC.
       17.2.1.3. Submit to DLIS all recommendations for changes in FSC principles, rules, and
       structure, which are considered essential for efficient logistical operations.
       17.2.1.4. Resolve all FSC conflicts between two or more interested USAF activities.
       17.2.1.5. Input necessary changes/corrections to D086 System (Mission Workload
       Assignment).
   17.2.2. ALC/AFGLSC will:
       17.2.2.1. Determine the FSC assignment for new items entering the USAF Supply
       System.
       17.2.2.2. Ensure all new items are properly classified according to rules of the FSC
       Program.
       17.2.2.3. Review, in conjunction with the FSC Item Manager, all MMAC assignments
       (except the reclassifications by DLIS as specified in paragraph 17.4.2) to ensure
       compliance with requirements.
       17.2.2.4. Review the FSC structure for the purpose of proposing changes.
       17.2.2.5. Submit FSC structure proposals following procedures in Chapter 3 of this
       manual.
 82                                                  AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


17.3. Procedures Applicable to New Items Requiring NSN Assignment.
   17.3.1. The initial FSC/MMAC assigned to a new item entering the USAF Supply System,
   via the provisioning process, is reviewed by the AF cataloging agent prior to cataloging
   action.
      17.3.1.1. If the initial FSC/MMAC assigned to the item is correct, the item is processed
      to DLIS for NSN assignment.
      17.3.1.2. If it has been determined the initial FSC/MMAC assigned to the item is
      incorrect and requires an FSC change, the gaining FSC technician will:
          17.3.1.2.1. Annotate the changes FSC/MMAC in the D143C System by accessing the
          message (MSSG) screen and assigning one of the five response codes (FA through
          FE) for FSC/MMAC changes on new non-cataloged (NC) item requests.
          17.3.1.2.2. Notify the responsible ALC/AFGLSC or Contractor ICP when the item
          cannot be processed using D143C (for security reasons) because of the FSC.
      17.3.1.3. When the FSC change does not change management responsibility, the item is
      processed to the AF cataloging agent for NSN assignment.
      17.3.1.4. If changing the FSC changes management responsibility:
          17.3.1.4.1. The ALC/AFGLSC may request a management transfer at the time of the
          FSC change. The gaining ALC/AFGLSC will furnish a written request to justify
          management to the losing ALC/AFGLSC for concurrence.
          17.3.1.4.2. When the AF cataloging agent initiates an FSC change, item management
          responsibility will be retained at the originating ALC/AFGLSC by application of the
          following rules:
              17.3.1.4.2.1. If a MMAC has been assigned and an FSC change is required, the
              AF cataloging agent will assign the new FSC and retain the assigned MMAC
              submitted with the old FSC.
              17.3.1.4.2.2. If a MMAC has not been assigned, the AF cataloging agent will
              assign the FSC and return the request via the D143C or E-mail to ALC/AFGLSC
              for a MMAC assignment (reference Table 13.1.)
      17.3.1.5. When an FSC change creates an incompatibility between the FSC and MMAC,
      the losing AF cataloging agent will coordinate the necessary changes to the Functional
      OPR for the Mission Workload Assignment System, D086 System in the AFGLSC‘s 401
      SCMS. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will update D086 System to reflect the new
      FSC/MMAC compatibility.
17.4. Procedures Applicable to New Items Submitted for NSN Assignment Which Match
Existing NSNs in an FSC Other Than the Requested FSC.
   17.4.1. When a new item, submitted for NSN assignment, matches an existing NSN in an
   FSC other than the one signified by the submitted FSC, the cataloging activity will notify the
   initiator through the D143C System of the matching NSN.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  83


       17.4.1.1. The IM at the initiating ALC or Contractor ICP will attempt to cancel the
       procurement action on the item. If this cannot be accomplished, the IM of the matching
       NSN will be notified in writing.
       17.4.1.2. An NSN will be assigned to the new item; however, the NSN will be canceled
       as a duplicate to the existing NSN after delivery of initial procurement.
   17.4.2. Regardless of the MMAC assigned to the new item, the MMAC assigned to the
   matching NSN will be retained.
17.5. Undelivered Contract Balances. When an item is reclassified and additional quantities
of the item remain undelivered on the active contract, the contractor is notified of the change in
NSN resulting from the reclassification. The following actions are taken:
   17.5.1. The losing activity will notify the contractor of the NSN change through the contract
   administration office as soon as the verification of the change is received from the AF
   cataloging agent.
   17.5.2. If the losing manager is not within the activity having responsibility for the contract
   involved, the losing manager will advise the responsible activity at the same time the
   contractor is notified of the NSN change in order to revise all pertinent records.
   17.5.3. The losing manager will furnish complete information, by letter, to the servicing or
   responsible contract administration activity.
17.6. FSC and MMAC Changes to Existing NSNs. The following conditions may require
FSC or MMAC changes:
   17.6.1. A published structural change has changed the classification of an item to another
   FSC or a change in the item of supply concept necessitates a change in classification of the
   item.
   17.6.2. An item is improperly classified in one FSC and should be transferred and classified
   in another FSC.
   17.6.3. An item is improperly described and the revised II requires an FSC change.
   17.6.4. The transfer of an item from one weapon system commodity grouping or other
   management aggregation grouping to another aggregation.
   17.6.5. An item is canceled as a duplicate or replaced by another NSN.
17.7. Processing of FSC Change. Notification of an FSC change to an AF-managed item is
sent by the AF cataloging agent to the 754 ELSG, which will generate a transaction code 118.
The item is established without a change to the AF IM-ALC. This is accomplished by assigning,
when appropriate, the losing FSC/MMAC to the item manager in the gaining FSC, regardless of
the valid FSC and MMAC combinations in the Mission Workload Assignment System, D086
System. One exception is when the gaining FSC is a total MMAC class and the assignment of
the losing FSC MMAC or residual MMAC would be an invalid MMAC for the gaining FSC, for
example: FSG 18 or FSC 4960.

      UNITED STATES AIR FORCE (USAF) MATERIEL IDENTIFICATION AND
                      PROVISIONING RELATIONSHIP

18.1. Relationship. Provisioning of spare parts for future support of USAF weapons systems,
equipment, or end articles provides the bulk of new NSN assignments. Materiel identification
(cataloging) and item standardization processes form a crucial relationship with provisioning and
acquisition logistics. An effective provisioning effort ensures accurate data. Obtaining technical
documentation permits complete II, IEC, NSN assignment, and logistics management data
determination. The goal of our acquisition process is to obtain state of the art, cost effective
equipment items, which meet our materiel management needs. Only those new items reliable,
maintainable, available, and cost effective should be permitted to enter the USAF Supply
System. The determination, identification, and dissemination of supply data provide the basis for
assuring efficient system, equipment, and end article logistics to support the entire operational
life of the system. The governing regulation is DODI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense
Acquisition System.
18.2. Responsibilities.
   18.2.1. HQ AFMC/A4R will:
       18.2.1.1. Plan, develop, and provide policies and criteria necessary to assure
       accomplishment of support for the provisioning function.
       18.2.1.2. Direct and guide implementation of policies and criteria in support of
       provisioning and acquisition logistics.
   18.2.2. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will:
       18.2.2.1. Ensure the quality, timeliness, and compatibility of materiel identification and
       IEC policies properly relate to provisioning and acquisition logistics policies and
       requirements.
       18.2.2.2. Maintain policies and criteria necessary to assure accomplishment of support
       for the provisioning function through IEC, materiel identification, and NSN assignment
       on initially provisioned items entering the USAF Supply System.
       18.2.2.3. Direct and guide implementation of policies and criteria in support of
       provisioning and acquisition logistics.
       18.2.2.4. Oversight of the cataloging activity‘s participation in pre-proposal, guidance,
       and provisioning source coding conferences ensuring that contractual requirements for
       technical documentation, IEC, materiel identification, and NSN assignment are met.
       18.2.2.5. Oversee the cataloging activity‘s performance of pre-provisioning review
       functions relative to Provisioning Technical Documentation (PTD), related Supplemental
       Data for Provisioning (SDFP), and Provisioning Screening Results (PSR) in advance of,
       during, or in lieu of attending provisioning conferences or depot committee meetings
       chaired by the provisioning activity ALC/AFGLSC or other services.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                85


      18.2.2.6. Establish and maintain liaison with the ALC/AFGLSC‘s Provisioning Offices,
      other S/A, POs, and contractors, as necessary, to accomplish the mission.
   18.2.3. Single Program Director (SPD) Prime Provisioning ALC/AFGLSC Provisioning
   Office will:
      18.2.3.1. Process PTD, SDFP, and PSR of documents not containing initial spares that
      are not submitted to the designated AF cataloging activity.
      18.2.3.2. Participate in pre-proposal, guidance, provisioning/depot committee meetings.
      18.2.3.3. Ensure HQ AFMC policies and criteria concerning preliminary IEC, materiel
      identification, and technical documentation are accomplished.
   18.2.4. If an item managed by a contractor is identified during the provisioning process, the
   Provisioning Office will immediately start the process to reassign the NSN to the AF or DLA
   as directed by AFMAN 23-110, V1, P2, C2, Section C.
      18.2.4.1. The Provisioning Office will notify the SSM/PO, ALC/AFGLSC LR Focal
      Point and the CSWS asset manager.
      18.2.4.2. The ALC/AFGLSC LR Focal Point will work with the Product Directorate to
      assign an ES and IM, if applicable, within 10 working days of receipt.
18.3. Pre-proposal and Provisioning Guidance Conferences.
   18.3.1. Pre-proposal and guidance conferences are crucial to achieve an effective
   provisioning and materiel identification effort. Contractors and USAF personnel come to a
   mutual understanding of contractual data requirements necessary to accomplish the objective
   and problems inherent in the process, which cause delay of initial system, equipment, or end
   article support, are minimized or eliminated.
   18.3.2. Presentation and discussion of concise instructions by the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS
   and/or the AF cataloging activity or ALC/AFGLSC provisioning personnel is crucial to
   ensure proper contractor orientation and performance. Topics include, but are not limited to,
   use of military or government standard or specification items, PN construction; PN
   precedence; CAGE codes; AINs; proposed FSC; screening of the FLIS; adequacy of SDFP;
   identification of items which are nuclear hardened, hazardous, electrostatic discharge (ESD),
   automatic data processing equipment (ADPE), contain precious metals, etc.; item
   standardization objectives, materiel identification objectives, and NSN assignment
   notification.
18.4. PTD/SDFP/PSR Processing by the Air Force Provisioning Agent in DLIS:
   18.4.1. Provisioning agent‘s processing of PTD, SDFP, or PSR may be performed in
   advance of, during, or in lieu of attending, the provisioning conference or depot committee
   meeting.
   18.4.2. Initial determinations are made by the ALC/AFGLSC provisioning personnel and are
   posted on the PTD for subsequent action on each item coded for procurement.
   18.4.3. Tasks to be accomplished by the provisioning agent in DLIS will include FSC
   assignment, assistance in assignment of IMC or MMACs; SDFP review, to ensure accuracy,
   adequacy, and acceptability of all data relating to physical, electrical, mechanical,
86                                                   AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010

  validation; CAGE code verification; PSR interpretation and providing existing NSNs and
  related data, as applicable; providing NSNs and related data of substitute, interchangeable, or
  preferred items; making every effort to obtain all SDFP necessary to accomplish subsequent
  actions; initiating resolution of problems encountered during processing; MOE rule
  determination; providing PICA codes; identification of items which are nuclear hardened,
  ESD, ADPE, or contain precious metals or hazardous materials; challenging suspected
  erroneous prices by comparing and documenting similar item prices and providing the data to
  the conference chairperson or provisioning office for subsequent price reduction negotiations
  by contract administrators; the assurance that cataloging actions, on already stock listed items
  (i.e., addition or change of reference numbers), are accomplished at the time the cataloging
  activity reviews the item, if adequate drawing, technical data, and PN information are
  available; performance of special program requirements, as applicable; formulation of
  comments and signing of official minutes to document problems and resolution efforts;
  completion of subsequent actions to ensure resolution of PTD processing problems; and
  reporting accomplished actions, as required.

           PRELIMINARY ITEM ENTRY CONTROL (IEC) SYSTEM (D155)

19.1. Purpose and Scope. The D155 System is the AF‘s preliminary IEC System. Through the
use of the FLIS screening and PN history files, or manually created inputs by DLIS technicians,
D155 ensures that only the best and most preferred parts are used in support of weapon systems.
The purpose of the D155 System is to automate the flow of logistics data to achieve improved
data integrity and provide on-line query capability. The system implements the concept of
distributive processing and allows technicians the capability to perform provisioning
responsibilities interactively. Decisions and annotations become part of the electronic record,
which are the source coding documents produced by the AFGLSC Provisioning System (D220),
used at Provisioning Conferences.
19.2. General. The D155 System processes the PPL data via FLIS screening results, history file
records, and technician on-line processing. The system allows on-line data entry by the
technicians reviewing the individual line items, in addition to the batch programming which
reviews and validates FLIS screening data and historical records for items previously processed.
FLIS screening data is obtained from batch generation of Logistics Screening Requests (LSR)
and technician on-line queries of pass-through screening results. D155 assigns and balances
workloads, generates reports, and edits all data that passes through the system. The system
improves productivity by simultaneously dispersing individual records to the responsible FSC
technicians. Technician accountability is reinforced with permanent identification of the
responsible technician on each record reviewed. In addition, the records to be reviewed are
minimized by D155 selecting for review only those records that contain NSL items and those
records that have stock listed items that could not be automatically processed by the system.
With the system being able to electronically transfer logistics data from the PSR to the PTD,
minimizing manual transcription of data enhances accuracy.
19.3. Responsibilities.
   19.3.1. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will:
       19.3.1.1. Determine system requirements and criteria in relation to the maintenance and
       distribution of input and output products flowing through the system.
       19.3.1.2. Generate and submit system change requests (SCR) in the form of Computer
       System Requirements Definition (CSRD) Program and system deficiencies in the form of
       Deficiency Reports (DR).
       19.3.1.3. Monitor system records and products to ensure timeliness and compliance with
       mission requirements and objectives.
       19.3.1.4. Exercise overall monitoring and programming of the data automation
       requirements of the D155 system.
       19.3.1.5. Implement and support the policies, procedures, and objectives of the D155
       system.
       19.3.1.6. Work directly with the DLIS provisioning focal points to correct identified
       deficiencies which would affect system use by the cataloging activity.

   19.3.2. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS/754 ELSG, Data System Support Manager, Development
   Activity, and Database Administrator, is responsible for system maintenance.
19.4. Interfaces. The D155 System interfaces with the following:
   19.4.1. D220, which operates at each of the four centers.
   19.4.2. FLIS, maintained by DLIS, the DLA cataloging activity located in Battle Creek, MI.
   19.4.3. Specialized product centers, located throughout the US.
19.5. Edits. There are 37 tables in the D155 Edit/Validation Database, which are used in both
the batch and on-line environment. In addition, there are a number of additional edits performed
in batch programs that validate the data before it is stored in the database.

               D043 ITEM MANAGEMENT CONTROL SYSTEM (IMCS)

22.1. Purpose and Scope. The IMCS was implemented in 1974 to provide for AF participation
in the FCP, as set forth by DOD 4100.39-M. D043 further supports AF cataloging policy
outlined in USAF Supply Manual, AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C7. Interfacing with FLIS and
numerous other databases, IMCS is a central repository of Federal and AF logistics data for over
two million AF-used items of supply. IMCS receives, validates, records, maintains, and
distributes CMD, II data, supply management data, and other information vital to AF logistics
support. The system facilitates AF involvement in numerous DOD-directed programs, such as:
DOD 4140.32-M, Defense Inactive Item Program (DIIP); the Item Management Coding (IMC)
Program (see Defense Integrated Materiel Management Manual for Consumable Items, DOD
4140.26-M); and the DOD Interchangeability and Substitution (I&S) Program. D043 regularly
provides data to nearly 50 downstream AF systems, including the D035 Stock Control and
Distribution (SC&D) System, D200 Secondary Item Requirements System (SIRS), and, via the
D071 SNUD, the D002A SBSS. A list of IMCS interfaces, each documented by Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA) or Interface Control Document (ICD), resides in the Q111A Corporate
Data Repository System (CDRS).
22.2. Responsibilities.
   22.2.1. HQ AFMC/A4R is responsible for IMCS data system policy.

Y                       P/N Data
22.5. Data Validation and Compatibility Edits.
   22.5.1. To maintain the integrity of its data, IMCS routinely performs edits on its master file.
   This process normally occurs when input transactions are received from FLIS, and again
   before stock list changes are sent downstream. Data elements are validated using a set of
   internal master file edits called the A6LS Tables. Data element compatibility is verified
   using a set of ―if-then‖ tables called the Data Element Edit Tables (DEETs). A6LS and
   DEETs edits are also used by the D143C FLIS Edit and Routing System (FERS) to edit
   cataloging requests. The DEETs may be viewed on-line via the ―Help‖ option in D043A.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                   93


     22.5.2. Erroneous data in the master file can impede the stock list change process and must
     be corrected promptly. Input transactions unacceptable for master file maintenance due to
     invalid or incompatible data are rejected to the AF cataloging agent on error listings. The AF
     cataloging agents in DLIS perform research and submit corrective transactions, as necessary,
     to resolve errors in the master file. If ALC/AFGLSC coordination is required to correct an
     error, the AF cataloging agent will forward applicable documentation to the ALC/AFGLSC
     with a 30 calendar day return suspense. The ALC/AFGLSC IM will ensure all data
     requested by the AF cataloging agent is returned within the suspensed time frame. Upon
     receipt of the requested data, the AF cataloging agent technician will review the response,
     complete additional coordination as required, and submit the applicable transactions to
     correct the master file. Reference Table 22.2 for D043 error conditions and definitions.

  22.6.1. IMCS data is a useful tool in making a variety of logistical decisions throughout the
  AF and DOD. It can be used for performing research and technical reviews, validating and
  updating local records, and providing statistical counts. While item-by-item interrogation of
  IMCS data can be performed on-line via the D043A MIIDB, tailored data extracts from the
  IMCS master files are also available by special request. By specifying various extract
  parameters, users can obtain information for items based on a specific range or category (e.g.,
  FSC, SOS, and/or numerous other data elements).
  22.6.2. For guidance in obtaining IMCS data extracts and related statistical information,
  ALC/AFGLSC personnel should contact their local cataloging POC, who will facilitate
  submittal of the request to the IMCS Functional OPR. Others should contact the D043
  Functional OPR at the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS directly.

                 FLIS EDIT AND ROUTING SYSTEM (FERS OR D143C)

24.1. Purpose and Scope. The D143C System is designed to suspend AF Requests for
Cataloging Data/Action from the ALCs, Contractor ICPs, and Logistics Readiness Squadron
(LRS) personnel on-line. It forwards some of these requests to the AF cataloging agent, to other
special or mission-unique cataloging activities, IMCS, or directly to the FLIS System for further
processing. It also receives data from these systems. Rejects received from FLIS are returned to
either the AF cataloging agent or directly to the initiating activity for appropriate action. The
new items, revisions, and base initiated requests are suspended pending notification of
completion. Upon a receipt of notification of approval (KNA) from FLIS, a request is cleared
and notification is automatically forwarded to the AF cataloging agent and the activity which
initiated the request.
24.2. General. The on-line D143C System, located at WPAFB, OH, is accessible by personal
computer seven days a week. The system displays formatted screens to which the users respond
to initiate, modify, or research logistics data requests. The batch processing functions are
necessary for the support of the on-line D143C. It allows for interfacing with the other AF and
DOD systems, suspense file maintenance, and report generation. The batch processing runs for a
half hour every workday at 1900 hrs Eastern Standard Time.

       objectives.
       24.3.2.3. Generate and request system changes in the form of CSRDs. The CSRDs are
       documented and monitored in the Information System Management Tool (ISMT).
       24.3.2.4. Identify and report problems in the form of DRs to correct system errors.
       These are documented and monitored in the ISMT.
       24.3.2.5. Analyze and develop system logic for implementing new capability, changes,
       or corrections to the system.
       24.3.2.6. Maintain surveillance over all system records and products to ensure timeliness
       and compliance with mission requirements and objectives.
   24.3.3. 754 ELSG, as the program manager, is responsible for monitoring overall data
   automation requirements of this system.
24.4. Edits. User cataloging requests, along with CMD, are edited and validated for
compatibility. These edits and validations help ensure that all AF activities receive accurate,
compatible, and current data. The criteria used in performing these edits are contained in the

         GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY DATA EXCHANGE PROGRAM (GIDEP)

26.1. GIDEP Background. GIDEP is a program of cooperative data exchange between
government and industry. It is a central mechanism to identify and purge defective parts,
components, materiels, and processes during all phases of systems and equipment life cycle from
existing system inventories and prevent their re-entry into AF inventories or designs. GIDEP
provides an AF communication system for transmitting information on defective parts to all
activities and agencies concerned with the management, contracting, or use of the parts and
controls to ensure effective corrective action. This data exchange supports the Diminishing
Manufacturing Sources and Materiel Shortages (DMSMS) Program outlined in AFMCI 23-103.
The related website is http://www.gidep.org.
26.2. Participating Activities. Includes US Government acquisition and support activities,
contractors and subcontractors, manufacturers, consulting firms, educational institutions, public
and private utilities, the Canadian Department of National Defense, and members of Canadian
industry. Any activity, which generates these types of data GIDEP exchanges, may be
considered for membership. Classified and proprietary information is not included in GIDEP.
26.3. GIDEP Data Interchanges.
   26.3.1. The Engineering Data Interchange (EDI) contains readily available engineering and
   quality data covering a large number of technical areas. It includes engineering reports,
   management reports, non-standard parts, process specifications, test reports, and a soldering
   technology library.
   26.3.2. Metrology Data Interchange (MDI) contains a broad range of measurement related
   subjects; the major emphasis is on calibration procedures and technical manuals.
   26.3.3. Reliability-Maintainability Data Interchange (RMDI) documents and reports on the
   Reliability and Maintainability of parts, components, equipment, systems, and materiel based
   on field performance and/or reliability demonstration tests. It also contains reports on
   theories, methods, techniques, and procedures related to reliability and maintainability
   practices.
   26.3.4. Failure Experience Data Interchange (FEDI) contains objective failure information as
   a result of ALERTs, SAFE-ALERTs, Problem Advisories, Action Agency Notices, and
   Urgent Data Requests which notify users of non-conforming parts, components, chemicals,
   processes, materiels, and safety and hazardous conditions.
   26.3.5. Product Information Data contains information on manufacturer‘s Product Change
   Notices and DMSMS Notices.
26.4. Products. The five GIDEP data interchanges provide the following information and are
available to GIDEP member organizations on a database, managed by the OSD.

   been unable to find. All available sources and the GIDEP data banks will be researched
   before issuing a UDR.
   26.4.3. GIDEP Form 97-1, ALERT Data Form. The ALERT System is part of FEDI and
   provides early notification of actual or potential problems and failure trends on items,
   materiels, manufacturing processes, test equipment, or significant safety problems. ALERTs
   are issued against a specific product, not against all items produced by that manufacturer.
   The initiator of an ALERT will coordinate it with the manufacturer, and then send it to the
   GIDEP Operations Center for distribution to all FEDI participants. This is also true for
   SAFE-ALERTs, which address problems that could affect the safety of personnel or cause
   damage to facilities or equipment.
   26.4.4. GIDEP Form 97-2, Problem Advisory Data Form. This form is used to provide the
   earliest possible notification of a potential problem. It allows information to be exchanged
   when a potential problem is first identified.
   26.4.5. GIDEP Form 97-4, DMSMS Notice. This form isssued to all GIDEP participants to
   give notice of manufacturer discontinuance of a product. The manufacturer may provide a
   recommended replacement or request a one-time ―life-of-type‖ buy to support the user‘s
   lifetime requirement.
   26.4.6. GIDEP Form 97-5, Product Change Notice. This form is issued to GIDEP
   participants for notification of a product change. The change could involve qualification data
   or a manufacturing process change. Most product change notices are issued on

   MIL-HDBK-300/STANDARDIZED TECHNICAL INFORMATION FILE (TIF) OF
                      SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (SE)

28.1. Background. MIL-HDBK-300 contains information on SE items used within all branches
of the DOD and contractor design activities, such as characteristics, functional description, line
drawing, and other logistics information and has its own WEB site at https://www.afmc-
mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/LG/lgi-page/lgis/MIL300/Milindex.htm. The data found within
MIL-HDBK-300 is obtained from SE Illustrations (SEIs), AF Form 601, Support Equipment
Recommendation Data (SERDs), and contractor provided data, which is normally obtained as
part of the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs) or equivalent documents prepared
organically.
28.2. General. The purpose of MIL-HDBK-300 is to allow contractor and government
personnel a quick and easy method to determine preferred and in-inventory SE. It provides a
listing of stock listed SE used on missile or aircraft weapon systems, which may be considered
for application in lieu of developing and testing new items. The primary users of MIL-HDBK-
300, within the AF, are the AFMC POs, ALCs, CSWS, and AF cataloging agent personnel.
28.3. Definition of SE. MIL-HDBK-300 SE is defined as any equipment required to make a
weapon system, command and control system, support system, subsystem, or item operational in
its intended environment. This includes equipment required to install, launch, arrest (except
Navy shipboard and shore-based launching and arresting equipment), guide, control, direct,
inspect, test, adjust, calibrate, appraise, gauge, measure, assemble, disassemble, handle,
transport, safeguard, store, actuate, service, repair, overhaul, maintain, operate, arm, or rearm the
system, subsystem, end item, or component. This definition applies regardless of the method of
development, funding, or procurement.
28.4. Guidelines. MIL-HDBK-300 will contain only procurable existing SE items. The

   29.1.2. Primary objectives are to minimize the introduction of unnecessary SE into the AF
   inventory and to consider proposed changes to the AF AS.
       29.1.2.1. A SERD is used for technical service evaluation, maintenance function
       proposals, and cataloging and standardization actions.
       29.1.2.2. A SERD is also used to determine whether the item is to be contractor-
       furnished equipment (CFE) or government-furnished equipment (GFE).
       29.1.2.3. SERDs will identify the requirements for spare parts, technical orders (TO),
       reprocurement data, or SEI.
29.2. Background. After a contract has been awarded, the contractor prepares a SERD on each
item of SE required. A SERD is created and submitted prior to the availability of detailed
drawings and technical information.
   29.2.1. SE is all equipment required to maintain a weapon system, support system, or item of
   SE in operational condition in its intended environment.

AFMC PARTICIPATION IN THE DEFENSE STANDARDIZATION PROGRAM (DSP)

30.1. Responsibilities. The directives governing the preparation of standardization documents
are identified in Table 30.1 The responsibilities for the DSP are delegated to various DOD
activities. DSP policy originates from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD).
S/A implementation of the DSP is directed by the Departmental Standardization Office (DepSO).
DSP implementation is further developed within the AF through a Command Standardization
Office (ComSO). The responsibilities have been divided into functional areas for performance
of specific tasks. These functional areas are the Lead Standardization Activity (LSA),
participating activity, custodian, preparing activity (PA), review activity, and item reduction
activity. The responsibilities for these functional areas are identified in the Federal
Standardization Manual and the DOD 4120.24-M, Defense Standardization Program Policies
and Procedures Manual. Many standardization actions require a coordinated effort among the
standardization, engineering, item management, ES, and cataloging communities. These
interactions are identified in Chapters 30 through 34.
30.2. AFMC Organization for Standardization. The HQ AFMC/EN, Directorate of
Engineering and Technical Management, Standardization Division, is designated the ComSO
(Code 10) for the AF. The AFMC ComSo is responsible for administration and supervision of
AFMC participation in the DSP. The ComSO provides general policy guidance to responsible
organizations within the command. The remaining centers, organizations, and offices, which
participate in the DSP, are designated as Standardization Management Activities (SMAs).

                   PROCESSING STANDARDIZATION DOCUMENTS

31.1. Initial Actions.
   31.1.1. Sequence of Actions. The preparation of standardization documents normally
   proceeds through the following sequence of actions:
       31.1.1.1. Establish a requirement for an item.
           31.1.1.1.1. Search for Existing Standardization Documents. The name of the item
           determines the applicable Federal Supply Class (FSC) and is determined using the
           Cataloging Handbook,H-6 and the Cataloging Handbook H2-1 for Federal Supply
           Classification, Groups and Classes. The item and name are used to search the
           ASSIST for the most recent existing document. An existing document will be revised
           to include a new requirement in preference to preparing a new duplicator overlapping
           document. Note: If a revision cannot be completed in a timely manner, an interim
           document will be prepared. Refer to the DSP Policies and Procedures Manual, DOD
           4120.24-M; Preparation of Military Specifications.
              31.1.1.1.1.1. The SD-4, Status of Standardization Projects, or the project portion
              of the ASSIST database, http://ASSIST.daps.dla.mil is reviewed to determine if a
              new document is in preparation by another DOD activity.
              31.1.1.1.1.2. Industry sources are reviewed to determine the availability of a
              NGS.
       31.1.1.2. Document Preparation:
           31.1.1.2.1. If a new standardization document must be prepared, the following order
           of preference will be followed according to the Defense Federal Acquisition
           Regulation (DFAR), part 11, paragraph 11.101:
              31.1.1.2.1.1. Documents mandated for use by law.
              31.1.1.2.1.2. Performance-oriented documents.
              31.1.1.2.1.3. Detailed design-oriented documents.
              31.1.1.2.1.4. Standards, specifications, and related publications, issued by the
              government outside the defense or federal series, for the non-repetitive acquisition
              of items.
       31.1.1.3. Determining the Proper Type of Acquisition Document. The type of document
       to be prepared is determined by the type of item or services to be procured. An item
       unique to a military application is described in a MILSPEC. A commercial off-the-shelf
       (COTS) or modified COTS item is described in a federal series document, such as a
       FED-SPEC or CID, depending on the complexity of the requirements. An NGS may be
       adopted in lieu of a FED-SPEC or CID, if available or if a Non-Government Standards
       body (NGSB) is willing to prepare one. (NGSs are documents, issued by private sector
       organizations, which describe goods, services, and engineering practices commonly
       available to the general public.)
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               121


     31.1.1.4. Request ComSO Approval to Develop a New Standardization Document. PAs
     are responsible for preparation of the proper type of standardization documents in their
     assigned FSC. Preparation of a new document, in an FSC or area other than those listed
     in the SD-1 for a PA, requires ComSO approval. The approval process is required to
     minimize the quantity of standardization document transfers between AFGLSC/ALC.
        31.1.1.4.1. The SD-1 identifies FSC and area assignments under administrative
        control of the Defense Standardization Program (DSP). The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS
        is identified in the SD-1 as Standardization Code 99 with FSC and area assignments.
        Any document prepared in these FSCs/areas also requires ComSO approval prior to
        preparation.
        31.1.1.4.2. Requests for approval are by letter and provide the following information:
            31.1.1.4.2.1. Proposed FSC/area.
            31.1.1.4.2.2. Proposed title.
            31.1.1.4.2.3. Proposed type of document.
            31.1.1.4.2.4. Scope of the document.
            31.1.1.4.2.5. Basis for the requirement.
            31.1.1.4.2.6. E/I application, as applicable.
            31.1.1.4.2.7. General physical and functional description of the item, as
            applicable.
     31.1.1.5. Standardization Projects. To develop a new standardization document or make
     changes to an existing one, the PA will contact the LSA and request authorization to
     begin a standardization project. The establishment of a standardization project is a
     cooperative effort between the PA and the LSA to ensure that standardization projects are
     needed and will achieve the objectives of the DSP in a timely and cost-effective manner.
     The LSA must ensure compliance with DOD standardization policies, but must also be
     sensitive to each DOD activity's acquisition and technical needs. The LSA's management
     involvement will continue throughout the life of a standardization project. As the
     standardization manager for a FSG, a FSC, or a standardization area, the LSA should
     assist, if necessary, the Preparing or Adopting Activity (PAA) in determining custodians,
     resolving standardization problems, raising standardization issues to higher authority, and
     promoting the timely completion of standardization projects.
        31.1.1.5.1. Standardization Documents Requiring Project Numbers. All DOD PA
        must get standardization project numbers to revise, amend, change, reinstate,
        inactivate for new design, cancel, or develop a new standardization document. The
        adopting activity must get a standardization project number for the adoption or
        withdrawal of adoption of a NGS. Item reduction studies and engineering practice
        studies also require standardization project numbers.          The only type of
        standardization document that does not require a project number is a validation
        notice.
        31.1.1.5.2. Standardization Project Number Structure. The standardization project
        number shall consist of two parts. The first part is the applicable FSG, the FSC, or the
 122                                                  AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


          standardization area. The second part shall be a non-significant four-digit number
          serially assigned in each FSG, FSC, or standardization area, e.g., 2620-0023, 15GP-
          1590, or CMAN-0934. Once all non-significant four-digit numbers have been
          assigned in a FSG/ FSC, or a standardization area, the numbering sequence shall start
          again with "-0001)." Closely related projects initiated in the same timeframe may be
          identified by a project number followed by a dash and sequentially assigned
          subproject numbers, e.g., 5960-0001-001, 5960-0001-002, and 5960-0001-003.
          31.1.1.5.3. Standardization Project Submission. All new standardization projects are
          submitted through the ASSIST Project portion of the ASSIST database.
31.2. Document Research.
   31.2.1. Market Research and Analysis (MR&A).
       31.2.1.1. MR&A is the collection and evaluation of data necessary to determine:
          31.2.1.1.1. Salient characteristics, which a product must possess to meet a particular
          government user‘s need.
          31.2.1.1.2. Availability of products possessing the salient characteristics.
          31.2.1.1.3. Alternative acquisition strategies available for acquiring such products
          (i.e., locally purchased, off the GSA schedule, interservice or interagency SSRs, etc.).
   31.2.2. FSC and Item Name of the Item (Title).
       31.2.3.1. The FSC for a standardization document is determined according to the
       Cataloging Handbook H2-1, Federal Supply Classification (FSC).
       31.2.3.2. Standardization documents will be titled according to the Cataloging
       Handbook H-6, Federal Item Name Directory.
       31.2.3.3. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will forward all AF prepared standardization
       documents to the AF cataloging agent, for their review to determine the proper FSC and
       Item Name of the item (title of the document).
   31.2.3.4. Acquisition Management System Control (AMSC) number.
       31.2.3.5. An AMSC number is required on all standardization documents that reference a
       DID. Refer to DOD Manual 4120.24-M. Defense Standardization Program.
       31.2.3.6. Standardization documents that do not originate or include data requirements
       will reflect "AMSC N/A."
       31.2.3.7. Military handbooks and bulletins, CIDs, and NGSs shall not be source
       documents for DIDs; therefore, are annotated "AMSC N/A."
   31.2.4. Part or Identifying Number (PIN) Structure.
       31.2.4.1. When a specification covers more than one part, item, or materiel that is subject
       to assignment of an NSN and an identification problem in the federal supply system may
       result, a specification-based PIN, to identify the parts, items or materiels, will be
       included.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 123


      31.2.4.2. A market analysis should be conducted prior to development of a PIN, to
      determine standard lengths, sizes, colors, etc. of the product being described by the
      specification.
      31.2.4.3. PINs developed for products covered by the same specification shall be
      uniform in structure. Uniformity is also desired for all PINs within the same group of
      closely related items.
      31.2.4.4. PIN development is the responsibility of the document PA; but requesting a
      PIN be included in the document may be submitted as an essential comment during
      document coordination. When submitting such a comment, the submitter will provide a
      proposed PIN structure.
   31.2.5. Concluding Materiel. The last data located in a standardization document, prior to
   the DD Form 1426, Standardization Document Improvement Proposal.
      31.2.5.1. The concluding materiel will contain information on the PA, project number,
      interested government review activities, and interested industry organizations. The SD-1
      contains codes used to identify interested activities. The SD-4 contains project number
      information, which can also be found in the Project portion of the ASSIST database.
31.3. Acquisition of Commercial Products.
   31.3.1. Policy.
      31.3.1.1. Established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
      31.3.1.2. The OASD states "The US Government will purchase COTS products, when
      such products will adequately serve the US Government's requirements."
      31.3.1.3. Designed to reduce research, engineering acquisition, and support costs by:
          31.3.1.3.1. Maximizing the acquisition and use of items regularly manufactured and
          sold off-the-shelf, in the public marketplace, with minimal or no required
          modification.
          31.3.1.3.2. Encouraging, recognizing, and evaluating technological innovations in
          commercial items that are applicable to DOD needs.
   31.3.2. Procedures. When it is determined that a FED-SPEC or CID is required for a
   commercial type product, the following procedures will be followed:
      31.3.2.1. Perform market analysis to determine whether one or more commercial items
      are available which can meet or approximate the established need.
      31.3.2.2. Ensure the specification or CID contains only the minimum requirements,
      stated in performance terms that will enable purchase of the acceptable commercial
      products "off-the-shelf."
      31.3.2.3. Quality assurance requirements will be included in a CID when they are
      determined to be essential. They will not exceed what a non-government buyer might
      prudently request.
 124                                                  AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


       31.3.2.4. Ensure that the specification or CID supports the acquisition strategy for the
       product. The PA must consider the method of acquisition, storage, distribution, logistic
       support, and maintenance intended for the product while preparing the document.
       31.3.2.5. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS reviews all AFGLSC/ALC prepared CIDs.
   31.3.3. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS provides final approval for AFGLSC/ALC-prepared
   CIDs and provides a document identifier and approval date.
31.4. Coordination of Standardization Documents.
   31.4.1. Full or Limited Coordination Determination is accomplished by the PA according to
   DOD 4120.24-M.
       31.4.1.1. All AF prepared documents will be reviewed by the center safety office during
       the draft coordination cycle. If, during the preparation of the final document, changes are
       made which may affect safety, the document will be coordinated a second time with the
       center safety office.
       31.4.1.2. Federal series documents are coordinated with appropriate GSA commodity
       centers, as indicated in the SD-1.
       31.4.1.3. Drafts of new standardization documents are coordinated locally, with DOD
       and industry for comments and to determine interest for a fully coordinated document.
       31.4.1.4. If immediate acquisition is required, coordination is limited to local activities
       that are essential to ensure an acceptable document is prepared for the initial acquisition.
       Full coordination is initiated immediately after the initial limited coordinated document is
       approved.
       31.4.1.5. Comments are incorporated or resolved according to DOD 4120.24-M.
           31.4.1.5.1. Essential Comments. Comments covering requirements or provisions of
           such importance to the mission of the commenting activity that it must be accepted or
           reconciled. Essential comments without clear and valid justification will be
           considered suggested comments.
           31.4.1.5.2. Suggested Comments. Comments covering changes considered desirable
           but not essential. Comments on format, grammar, and punctuation are usually
           suggested comments (refer to DOD 4120.24-M). Non-critical technical comments
           may also be suggested comments.
Note: The best-stated and/or most comprehensive reasons do not convert a suggested comment
into an essential comment. A comment is either essential or suggested because of its effect on
the usability of the document. Ensure essential comments have a proper basis as well as a sound
justification.
31.5. Quality Control Review.
   31.5.1. General Procedures. All draft documents prepared by the ALCs will be forwarded
   through their standardization focal point, as identified in the SD-1, to the AFGLSC‘s 401
   SCMS during the draft coordination cycle. Draft documents will be sent to 401 SCMS via E-
   mail prepared in Microsoft Word. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will make minor corrections
   to the document, as necessary. Corrections to format, grammar, and punctuation need not be
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             125


  coordinated with the PA. Any corrections in regards to the technical content of the document
  must be coordinated with the engineer who has responsibility for the document. Once the
  AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS has completed its review, the draft document will be returned to the
  ALC standardization focal point. The responsible engineering office will incorporate any
  approved technical comments made by industry or other DOD activities during the draft
  coordination.
  31.5.2. Final Approval and Processing.
     31.5.2.1. The ALCs standardization focal point will send finalized documents to the
     AFGLSC‘s 401SCMS via E-mail in Microsoft Word format. After their review the
     AFGLSC will either contact the submitting AFGLSC/ALC if changes are necessary or
     forward the document to the Department of Defense Single Stock Point (DODSSP) for
     publication and distribution. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will convert the document to
     Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) before sending to the DODSSP. This is to meet
     the requirements established in DOD 4120.24-M, Defense Standardization Program.
     31.5.2.2. DOD policy requires that each new performance based document (MIL-PRF)
     or detailed document (MIL-DTL) be certified by the Center Standardization Executive
     (CSE). A copy of the certification letter must be sent to the DODSSP along with the
     document when requesting publication and distribution. For performance based
     documents the letter must certify that the document is written in performance terms. For
     detailed documents, the letter must state that requirements are such that a detailed
     document must be used in lieu of a performance based document. Note: Proof of
     certification can also be provided via E-mail. The E-mail from the PA must show a clear
     audit trail from the CSE and must identify document being certified.
  31.5.3. Dating and Numbering.
     31.5.3.1. All finalized documents are sent to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS without a
     document date. The date is assigned by the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS, as printing by the
     DODSSP is time sensitive. This allows time if corrections must be made to the document
     after the final review by the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will
     provide a dated copy of the document to the AFGLSC/ALC concurrent with the copy
     forwarded for publication and distribution.
     31.5.3.2. When a new document is developed by the ALC, the ALC standardization
     focal point will send the finalized document to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS without a
     document identifying number. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will contact the DODSSP and
     request a document identifying number immediately prior to sending it for publication
     and distribution. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will provide a copy of the document with
     the new identifying number to the ALC concurrent with the copy forwarded for
     publication and distribution.
  31.5.4. Document Distribution.
     31.5.4.1. The DODSSP maintains an automatic distribution list for standardization
     documents based on FSC and standardization areas. The public and private sector
     organizations and individuals that subscribe to a FSC or a standardization area shall
     receive all new documents and changes to documents as they are published, except those
126                                                 AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


      documents that have restricted distribution. This distribution list is updated annually to
      determine need and subscription quantities.
      31.5.4.2. The DODSSP shall send one copy of all DOD-prepared Federal specifications,
      standards, CIDs to the GSA at the time of their initial publication
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 127

               STANDARDIZATION DOCUMENT RELATED ACTIONS

32.1. Safety Review of Standardization Documents.
   32.1.1. Responsibilities. All standardization documents, including purchase descriptions
   (PDs), used in acquisition of equipment/parts, require a safety review to ensure they meet
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. Standardization
   documents, prepared by the ALCs, are reviewed and approved by the AFGLSC/ALC/Product
   Centers Safety Office.
   32.1.2. Documentation. The coordination response from the lead engineering ESA will
   include a statement certifying an OSHA review has been performed. A copy of this response
   will be kept in the standardization document's engineering file.
   32.1.3. Processing.
      32.1.3.1. PA that has a designated agent (other than an AF activity) for a document will
      ensure an OSHA review is accomplished.
      32.1.3.2. The AF custodian activity will perform OSHA reviews for standardization
      documents prepared by other than AF activities. When the AF custodian is the
      AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS, the safety office of the AFGLSC/ALC assigned engineering
      responsibility for the document performs the OSHA review.
      32.1.3.3. The PA will provide certification of OSHA review, for retention in the
      document files of the standardization activity responsible for final review and dating of
      the standardization document. A certification of OSHA review will be provided to
      standardization activities for PDs at the time a request for stock list action is initiated.
32.2. Standardization Document Identifier Numbers.
   32.2.1. Assignment of standardization document identifier numbers is the responsibility of
   the DoDSSP. AF PA will contact the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS, code (99), for assignment of a
   document identifier number when preparing new military specifications, standards, or CIDs.
   32.2.2. Application. Document identifier numbers are affixed during final approval. Refer to
   DOD 4120.24-M.
   32.2.3. New draft documents are identified by three XXXs (i.e., MIL-DTL-XXX, MIL-PRF-
   XXX, MIL-STD-XXX, A-A-XXXXX) during coordination and in the SD-4.
32.3. PA Listings.
   32.3.1. Responsibilities. Each AFMC PA will maintain an accurate listing of all
   standardization documents for which they are the assigned PA.
      32.3.1.1. The listing will contain the basic document identifier number for each
      document revision, or amendment indicators are not required.
   32.3.1.2. . Transfers and cancellations will be annotated on the listing, as they occur, to
   maintain currency.
 128                                                AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


32.4. Transfer of Standardization Documents.
   32.4.1. Transfers are initiated to the ALCs through the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS. The
   AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will assist the ALCs in determining AF requirements for the
   document prior to accepting transfer.
   32.4.2. Intra Service Transfers.
       32.4.2.1. Standardization documents for design stable items are eligible for transfer to
       AFMC for maintenance for the duration of the need for the item.
       32.4.2.2. Standardization documents prepared by ASC remain with ASC until transition
       to AFMC.
          32.4.2.2.1. Transfers from ASC to AFMC may be refused for two reasons:
              32.4.2.2.1.1. The design is deemed unstable and engineering required is beyond
              AFMC capability and responsibility.
              32.4.2.2.1.2. There is no known AF requirement for the item/materiel/process
              covered by the document.
       32.4.2.3. ASC will propose cancellation of the standardization document if there are no
       know AF requirement.
   32.4.3. Inter Service Transfers.
       32.4.3.1. At times the AF has an engineering interest in a document that is prepared by
       another S/A that has proposed cancellation. When this occurs it may be necessary for the
       AF to take over as the preparing/engineering activity. The following actions must be
       taken to affect the transfer. Note: During the coordination of the proposed cancellation
       action, the AF engineering activity will indicate a willingness to accept PA
       responsibilities in their comments to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS.
       32.4.3.2. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will notify the current PA and arrange for the
       document standardization and engineering files to be transferred to the appropriate AF
       activity. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will also ensure that the DODSSP and responsible
       LSA are notified of the change.
32.5. Overage Document Review.
   32.5.1. Annual Overage Listing.
       32.5.1.1. Active ASSIST documents that have not been revised, amended, or validated in
       the past 5 years or do not have active project numbers in the SD-4 are identified as
       overage documents.
       32.5.1.2. The DODSSP will distribute a listing of overage documents annually to PAs,
       the Departmental Standardization Office and DSP Office.
       32.5.1.3. The AFGLSC/ALC standardization focal point will forward one copy to the
       AFGLSC.
       32.5.1.4. The AFGLSC will review the listing and return recommended actions.
       32.5.1.5. All listed documents must be updated during the following year.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               129


      32.5.1.6. Each PA will annotate a copy of the listing, as to action to be taken or already
      accomplished, and return it to the AFGLSC.
          32.5.1.6.1. The IM will work with the appropriate engineering office to determine the
          essentiality of an overage specification for future procurement.
          32.5.1.6.2. Written coordination and concurrence, by both the IM and responsible
          engineer, will be submitted with the listing for all documents identified for
          cancellation. This written coordination will be maintained in the standardization
          activity's document file. Note: This is required only for specifications that are
          identified on the overage document list.
      32.5.1.7. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will review the annotated listing and take action, as
      directed, by the AFGLSC/ALCs. Actions within the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS‘s authority
      to take without further coordination with the ALC engineering office are cancellation,
      inactivation for new design, and validation. For all other actions, the AFGLSC‘s 401
      SCMS must become the agent for the ALC and coordinate with the responsible
      engineering office.
   32.5.2. Prioritizing Overage Documents. Overage documents will be prioritized to ensure
   they are updated and to minimize backlogging documents into the next annual review cycle.
      32.5.2.1. Documents not updated by the end of the annual cycle will receive priority over
      documents in the next cycle. Documents with the oldest date will receive the highest
      priority. This must be tempered with the fact that a document that is also overage but not
      as old may actually get a higher priority due to a more important procurement need.
      32.5.2.2. The LSA will initiate cancellation action on documents over six years old
      according to DOD 4120.24-M.
      32.5.2.3. Standardization Policy. Specifications are maintained only as long as they are
      needed for procurement purposes. This policy will be strictly enforced by the ALC
      standardization focal point and the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS.
      32.5.2.4. Overage specifications supported by agent activities will also be verified by
      their IM activity.
      32.5.2.5. The validation process for overage documents includes an OSHA review.
32.6. Canceled Standardization Documents.
   32.6.1. Retention of Copies.
      32.6.1.1. PA will maintain a reproducible quality copy for canceled or superseded
      documents, if available, until assured the document will not be reinstated.
      32.6.1.2. Canceled and superseded documents may be disposed of after considering the
      above requirement.

                 OTHER STANDARDIZATION DOCUMENT SUBJECTS

33.1. Data Item Descriptions (DIDs). A DID is used when the government requires data to be
supplied under the terms of a contract. A DID specifically defines the data content, preparation
instructions, format, and its intended use. A list of approved DIDs and their source documents
can be found in the ASSIST.
   33.1.1. Policy and Procedures.
       33.1.1.1. Prepared according to DOD-STD-963, Department of Defense Standard
       Practice, Data Item Descriptions (DIDs).
       33.1.1.2. The AFMC data manager is located at HQ AFMC/EN; Systems Engineering
       Policy Division is the sole approving authority for new DIDs within the AF. All requests
       for new DIDs must be submitted through this office before being put on contract. DIDs
       shall be structured to facilitate the tailoring (deletion) of requirements not applicable to a
       specific acquisition.
       33.1.1.3. Any document that references a DID is required to have an AMSC number. If
       one has not already been assigned to the document, the preparing activity should access
       ASSIST and request assignment of a new AMSC number from AFMC/EN, Directorate of
       Engineering.
33.2. Qualified Products List (QPLs). PAs responsible for preparation, format, justification,
retention, authorization, and use of QPLs, will refer to the Federal Standardization Manual; SD-
6, Provisions Governing Qualification; SD-20 the DOD Qualification Program (How to use it);
and DOD 4120.24-M for instructions and responsibilities in the use and maintenance of QPLs.
33.3. Non-Government Standards (NGSs).
   33.3.1. Policy and procedures for NGSs are addressed in DOD 4120.24-M. Additional
   information can be found in the SD-9, DOD Guidance on Participating in the Development
   and Use of Non-Government Standards.
   33.3.2. Adoption and use is preferred in lieu of preparation of other types of ASSIST
   documents.
   33.3.3. Participation in Development.
       33.3.3.1. OMB Circular A- 119, Federal Participation in the Development and Use of
       Voluntary Consensus Standards and in the Conformity Assessment Activities, requires
       federal government participation in the activities of NGSBs.
       33.3.3.2. DOD components will provide representatives to industry standard bodies
       during development effort, as required.
           33.3.3.2.1. Participants are listed in the NGS Technical Committee Participation
           (TCP) Database at http://www.standards.gov or from the DSP home page link at
           https://www.dsp.dla.mil.
33.4. Non-ASSIST Documents. The FAR, Part 11, paragraph 11.102 states that requirements
documents will be developed according to guidance contained in the Federal Standardization
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             131


Manual FSM-2000 and, for DOD components, DOD 4120.24-M. There are situations when
development of a NGS, Federal or Military standard/specification is not warranted. These
include one-time purchases, small purchases, or when development of a standardization
document is not cost effective.
   33.4.1. PDs.
      33.4.1.1. PDs may be used when no satisfactory standardization document exists to buy
      products. Use of purchase descriptions shall be limited to one-time buys, small
      purchases, or when development of a standardization document is not considered cost
      effective. PDs are not intended for repetitive procurements.
      33.4.1.2. Disadvantages of using PDs:
          33.4.1.2.1. No ASSIST visibility, as PDs are not listed in the ASSIST. ASSIST
          documents are easily obtained by manufacturers who are considering bidding on
          DOD acquisitions. If a manufacturer misses the Government Business Opportunities
          advertisement for a PD item, they have no way to know the recurring requirement
          exists.
          33.4.1.2.2. Lack of visibility results in DOD PA developing similar PD to buy the
          same kind of item.
             33.4.1.2.2.1. Multiple NSNs may be assigned to an item of supply when
             descriptive data is unavailable, different PD numbers are assigned, and different
             manufacturers reference numbers make the item unrecognizable as the same item
             of supply.
             33.4.1.2.2.2. Central stock, store, and issue determinations are not evaluated
             because multiple requirements are only visible locally.
          33.4.1.2.3. PDs have no standardized format. Specific areas, such as requirements,
          quality assurance, etc., are difficult to locate.
          33.4.1.2.4. Coordination bypass of the standardization community and lack of cross-
          reference documentation jeopardizes proper standardization I&SGs, catalog phrase
          coding, etc.
          33.4.1.2.5. Items procured are not authorized for generic NSN relationships.
             33.4.1.2.5.1. DOD policy restricts generic NSN relationships to items procured
             under military, federal, or industry specifications.      Note:    A common
             misconception is that PDs are "quicker out the door" than ASSIST type
             documents because they don't require coordination with other DOD activities.
             However, the coordination cycle for a new CID is limited to 45 days, and, if an
             interim document to an existing ASSIST document is used, coordination is
             delayed for a period of up to two years. This permits the immediate use of the
             interim document to meet urgent needs.
             33.4.1.2.5.2. Safety Review. Items procured by PD require OSHA review during
             the local coordination cycle.

       33.4.1.3. PD identifiers, for one time buys and those that may lead to multiple buys, will
       be constructed as shown in Table 33.1 This standard format will facilitate inspections
       and audits for adherence to PD policy.

Table 33.1. Document Identifiers for Purchase Descriptions.

Notes:

1. A PD is a one-time buy and does not require a project number; however, it will require a buy
item CAGE code and PN to be added to the NSN.

2. The "Project Number" column refers to a DOD Standardization Project number. Information
on how to obtain standardization project number can be found in DOD 4120.24-M., Chapter 4,
paragraph C4.2. and SD-4, The Status of Standardization Projects.

3. ** indicate like information, as applicable.
       33.4.1.4. A copy of all AFGLSC/ALC prepared PDs will be forwarded to the AFGLSC‘s
       401 SCMS concurrent with the request for stock list action sent to the AF cataloging
       agent.
33.5. ASSIST.
   33.5.1. The DOD ASSIST contains information on all DOD prepared specifications,
   standards, and handbooks. In addition, ASSIST also contains federal documents and non-
   government documents adopted for DOD use.
   33.5.2. The ASSIST is a complete listing of all unclassified federal, military, and
   departmental specifications, standards, related standardization documents, and industry
   documents which have been adopted for DOD use. Use of the ASSIST is mandatory for all
   DOD activities. It is published in hardcopy and CD. ASSIST is comprised of three parts:
       33.5.2.1. Part I is an alphabetic listing of all active documents, listed by nomenclature,
       cross-referenced to document number, date, PA, and custodian.
       33.5.2.2. Part II is a numeric listing which reflects all active documents, in document
       number sequence, by document type. MIL SPECs, MIL STD, FED SPEC, FED STD,
       CID, QPLs, and industry documents, in that order. Part II also contains an appendix,
       which is a cumulative listing of all documents that have been canceled.
       33.5.2.3. Part III is a cumulative listing of documents in FSC sequence, indexed
       alphabetically.
   33.5.3. The hardcopy ASSIST is published annually in July and updated bimonthly by use of
   cumulative supplements. The Part II Appendix (listing of canceled documents) is the
   exception; it is published three times a year.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                  133


      33.5.3.1. Each section is updated with its own supplement. The CD-ROM version is
      published bimonthly with each bimonthly edition completely replacing the previous
      edition.
   33.5.4. Changes to ASSIST.
      33.5.4.1. Changes or corrections to existing ASSIST data are accomplished by
      submitting DD Form 1865, DOD Index of Specifications and Standards (DODISS)
      Change/Correction Request.
      33.5.4.2. PA submits DD Forms 1865 to their standardization activities for processing.
   33.5.5. Listing AF Interest Activities.
      33.5.5.1. The program for maintaining the ASSIST allows a maximum of five activity
      codes for each military service. PA and custodians are not designated as interest
      activities.
      33.5.5.2. Concluding materiel, of new and revised standardization documents, will
      indicate the interest activities in the order desired, especially when the total exceeds five
      activities.
33.6. Acquisition Streamlining and Standardization Information System (ASSIST).
   33.6.1. Introduction.
      33.6.1.1. The ASSIST is used by the DOD community in the management of the DSP.
      ASSIST is a tool used to provide timely information about specifications and standards
      imposed in the acquisition process and to attain visibility over the interrelationships
      between standardization documents. The ASSIST database presently consists of four
      major DOD standardization and acquisition databases. These databases include the
      ASSIST, SD-1, SD-4, and the AMSDL. These databases are accessed and the
      information is integrated to supply a variety of standardization document report
      capabilities, to support DSP initiatives and track/maintain current status of
      standardization projects.
      33.6.1.2. ASSIST is available in CD-ROM format, which is updated bimonthly or on-
      line. The ASSIST database is in operation at DODSSP, Philadelphia PA. Reports can be
      selected from the "MAIN MENU" to give hierarchical relationships between documents
      through their existing references. Reports may be accessed from the "MAIN MENU" to
      provide keyword searches and ad hoc queries as defined by the user. On-screen prompts
      identify information provided by individual reports and function keys are standardized to
      allow users to adapt easily to the software.
      33.6.1.3. This network environment allows users to generate and view current
      standardization reports and to download information to your personal computer. The
      download capabilities are available for interactive and batch reports. The ASSIST data is
      updated weekly with the latest information; however, it does not maintain a complete
      history file on document revisions. ASSIST provides information on active and canceled
      documents in the following categories: MILSPECs, MILSs, Military Sheet Form
      Standards (MS), AF-Navy Aeronautical Standards (AN), AF-Navy Aeronautical Design
      Standards (AND) drawings, military bulletins and handbooks, CIDs, adopted NGSs,
 134                                                   AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


       FIPS, QPLs, DIDs, International Standardization Agreements, DOD SDs, and Military
       Guide Specifications.
   33.6.2. System      Access.        ASSIST         may      be       accessed      via
   http://DODssp.daps.dla.mil/aDODssp.htm. A password is required prior to ASSIST
   access. Passwords may be obtained by calling the ASSIST Help Desk at Commercial (215)
   697-6257 or DSN 442-6257.
   33.6.3. Required changes to the ASSIST Database may be initiated via DD Form 1865. The
   phrase, "These changes are required to correct information in the ASSIST Database," will be
   included in the remarks block.
33.7. SD-1. Standardization Directory.
Note: The SD-1 although still available in hardcopy at this time, has become a sub database of
the ASSIST and is available to all ASSIST users. POC information available in ASSIST is apt to
be more current.
   33.7.1. Introduction. The SD-1 identifies the activities and responsibilities for those
   activities having an interest in the DSP.
   33.7.2. Description. The SD-1 is comprised of three parts: Part 1, known as the SMA List,
   identifies DOD SMAs and other interested organizations having responsibility for activities
   in the DSP. The inside front cover identifies the activities responsible for the various
   sections of the directory and explains how to submit changes. The forward and definitions
   sections give general information, a listing of standardization codes and descriptions, a listing
   of standardization documents and their Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) technical
   review offices, and a listing of prohibited references in standardization documents.
       33.7.2.1. Part 1 is made up of two segments.
           33.7.2.1.1. The first segment lists SMAs, sectioned off by military activities, defense
           agencies, and other elements of the Federal Government.
           33.7.2.1.2. Segment two lists SMAs in alphanumeric sequence by the designated
           activity codes for the SMAs.
       33.7.2.2. Part 2 is a list of standardization assignments, i.e. LSA, Participating Activity,
       Item Reduction Activity, etc. This is broken out by standardization area, FSG, and FSC.
       33.7.2.3. Part 3 provides standardization points of contact, including names, addresses,
       and telephone numbers for the DOD and civilian agencies. It also identifies
       standardization areas and FSCs in which DOD SMAs and civilian agencies have an
       interest and should review standardization documents and item reduction studies.
33.8. SD-4. Status of Standardization Projects.
Note: The SD-4 although still available in hardcopy at this time, has become a sub database of
the ASSIST and is available to all ASSIST users. Project information available in ASSIST is apt
to be more current.
   33.8.1. Introduction. The SD-4 indicates the status of standardization projects for the
   development, revision, and amendment of specifications, standards, handbooks, and studies.
   The SD-4 is compiled and published by Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS), from
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 135


  data submitted by standardization activities throughout DOD. Printing and distribution is
  accomplished on a quarterly basis.
  33.8.2. Description. The SD-4 is comprised of four parts.
     33.8.2.1. The first part lists standardization projects in FSC sequence.
     33.8.2.2. The second part is in PA sequence.
     33.8.2.3. The third part is the canceled projects section, also in FSC sequence.
     33.8.2.4. The fourth part cross-references document title to project in FSC sequence.
     33.8.2.5. Each listing contains an individual line for each project as well as a total of all
     projects within that FSC. All information is common to all sections. The purpose of
     having four listings is to allow users to search by PA, FSC, or to identify canceled
     documents.
     33.8.2.6. Inputs are made to DAPS via DD Form 1585, Standardization Project
     Transmittal Sheet. This form allows for input of a new submission or additional
     information at a later date.

                             ITEM REDUCTION PROGRAM

34.1. Item Reduction Studies (IRS) Responsibilities.
   34.1.1. Standardization activities ES will develop, administer, and coordinate programs for
   conducting IRS projects and preparing proposed IRS lists (PIRSL) in agreement with
   interdepartmental assignments, as designated in the SD-1.
   34.1.2. IRSs prepared in all FSCs/FSGs, whether prepared by an AF activity, an authorized
   agent for AF, by another S/A, will be coordinated with the appropriate ALC Engineering
   Support organization except in those cases as outlined in paragraph 34.3.2
   34.1.3. The AFGLSC is responsible for preparing IRSs in all FSCs, which have been
   assigned to AF with the exception of FSCs 1510, 1520, 1540, and 1550; the items stock
   listed in these four FSCs are the responsibility of ASC.
34.2. Procedures and Study Format. Procedures, data requirements, catalog data actions, and
format for IRSs and item standardization coding are according to DOD 4120.24-M, the Defense
Standardization Program (DSP) Policies and Procedures Manual.
34.3. 401 SCMS and the AFGLSC/ALC Coordination.
   34.3.1. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS or an agent so designated by them, will perform
   simultaneous review of all IRSs in which one or more of the ALCs have user interest
   recorded on at least one of the NSNs included in the study.
       34.3.1.1. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will review items with an Item Standardization
       Code (ISC) 1, related to items with an ISC 3, which indicate present AF use. See Table
       34.1 for ISCs.
       34.3.1.2. ALC engineering offices will review ISC 1 items for which they are the
       manager and/or user of the ISC 3 item.
   34.3.2. Coordination between the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS and the AFGLSC/ALC is not
   required for related items that are in an AF I&S Suspense System, D043B, I&SG and the ISC
   1 item is the group master.
   34.3.3. The ALCs will forward their comments to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS with sufficient
   lead time to allow 10 working days from the due date, to consolidate AF comments and
   prepare a reply to the PA. ALC comments will indicate total concurrence or identify, by
   index number, ISC 1/3 relationships that are not acceptable. Note: If the ALC review cannot
   be completed by the scheduled due date, it is the AFGLSC/ALC‘s responsibility to inform
   the AFLGSC‘s 401 SCMS. Following receipt of the request, the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will
   obtain an extension from the IRS PA prior to granting an extension to the ALC.
       34.3.3.1. When responding with a non-concurrence to a relationship, the engineer will
       include technical justification to support his/her decision.
       34.3.3.2. Comments will include the name, office symbol, and DSN number of the
       reviewer or responsible point of contact at the ALC.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                137


       34.3.3.3. The ALC will retain the IRS until they receive the summary of the completed
       study from the PA.
    34.3.4. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will contact the AF reviewers when comments differ as
    to acceptability of replacing ISC 1 items. If resolution cannot be reached between reviewers,
    the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will reply to the PA with a non-concurrence to the subject
    relationship.
    34.3.5. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will forward a listing to the AFGLSC/ALC
    standardization program focal point as indicated in the SD-1 after the IRS review is
    complete. This listing will identify the index number and corresponding NSN of each ISC 1
    item to be adopted for AF use.
    34.3.6. The appropriate AFGLSC/ALC ES, in conjunction with the IM, will initiate a
    Request for Cataloging Data/Action or SSR, as appropriate, to adopt replacing ISC 1 items,
    identified in the DLIS listing, for AF use.
    34.3.7. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will ensure NSNs on the adoption listing are adopted for
    AF use within 180 days. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will follow-up to the ALCs, as
    required, until all actions are complete.

Table 34.1. Item Standardization Codes (ISC)
ISC   Explanation
0     Items under the specification control of the DTRA or National Security Agency
      (NSA).
1     An item authorized for acquisition initially identified as a result of a formal IRS
      and accepted as a replacement for one or more items not authorized for acquisition
      (ISC 3). In generic relationships, a code 1 item is related to a code 2 item.
2     An item authorized for acquisition that has been included in an IRS, and which has
      no replacement item identified. Additionally, for generic relationships, an ISC 2
      shall be replaced by an ISC 1.
3     An item which, as a result of a formal IRS, is accepted as ―not authorized for
      acquisition‖ and must have a replacement (ISC 1 or B) NSN identified.
5     An item authorized for acquisition that has not yet been subject to item
      standardization.
6     An item authorized for acquisition that is in a specific FSC or AIN grouping,
      consisting primarily of items which are one-of-a-kind; therefore, little or no
      potential exists for elimination of items through a formal IRS.
7     NATO use only.
8     NATO use only.
B     A new item authorized for acquisition, contained in a new or revised superseding
      specification or standard that replaces prior items.
C     An item authorized for acquisition, which has been included in an IRS but an
      intelligent decision could not be made due to lack of sufficient technical data.
E     An item no longer authorized for acquisition, which has been replaced by an item

                                          Chapter 35

         INTERNATIONAL MILITARY STANDARDIZATION AGREEMENTS

35.1. Responsibility for Participation. Policies and responsibilities for compliance with
international military standardization agreements are subscribed to, and ratified by, the US and
USAF and delineated in AFPD 60-1, Air Force Standardization Program, AFI 60-101, Materiel
Standardization and implemented by AFI 60-106, The United States Air Force International
Military Standardization Program. Procedures for implementing International Military
Standardization Agreements can be found in DOD 4120.24-M, Defense Standardization
Program (DSP) Policies and Procedures Manual.
35.2. Standardization Agreements and Publications.
   35.2.1. NATO Standardization Agreements (STANAG) represent the record of an agreement
   amount, several, or all of the member NATO nations, will agree to adopt like or similar
   military equipment; operational, logistics and administrative procedures; and design criteria
   and techniques.
   35.2.2. A NATO Allied Publication (AP) is an informative or procedural publication issued
   by the NATO. They normally cover tactical, administrative, procedural, and logistical
   subjects.
   35.2.3. Air and Space Interoperability Council (ASIC) has air standards and standardization
   agreements, similar to NATO STANAGs. Each air standard is numbered according to the
   responsible working part and is coordinated with other S/As that may have an interest in the
   agreement. All participating Air Forces (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom,
   and the US) must ratify a proposed air standard before it can be enacted as a completed
   agreement; however, this ratification may include certain national reservations on specific
   details of the agreement. Procedures for the development and publication of air standards are
   found in ASIC instructions. National ratification of an ASCC air standard implies an
   obligation to implement the air standard, as modified by any reservations, in national orders
   and instructions.
   35.2.4. ASIC Advisory Publications are used to compile and exchange information, which
   the working parties determine is of value to the member services, but cannot be agreed on in
   an air standard. All nations must agree to issue an advisory publication, but need not be in
   full agreement as to its content. Implementation of national actions is not required. The
   ASIC Reference Catalog of Air Standard and Advisory Publications list the advisory
   publications; procedures for their development are found in the ASIC instructions. National
   ratification of an ASIC Advisory Publication does not obligate a nation to the
   implementation of the Advisory Publication nor to keep the national content current.
   35.2.5. American, British, Canadian, Australian Armies (ABCA) agreements, also known as
   Quadripartite Standardization Agreements (QSTAG), are agreements promulgated by an
   international military standardization organization of the armies of the same five English-
   speaking nations as in the ASIC. Note: New Zealand does not hold full membership and is
   represented by Australia.
   35.2.6. A list of approved agreements and air standards is included in the ASSIST.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               139


   35.2.7. The publications that implement these agreements are military and federal
   specifications and standards, drawings, or other technical publications. Some STANAGs are
   implemented by TOs.
35.3. Program Implementation.
   35.3.1. Procedures.
      35.3.1.1. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS is responsible for monitoring. When a STANAG
      (or any change to it) is implemented, the AF International Standardization Office
      (AF/ISO) is notified of the method and date of implementation. New international
      standardization agreements and changes to existing agreements, with AFMC interest, are
      forwarded, by the ISO to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS for monitoring action. The ISO
      identifies the implementing documents for new agreements.
      35.3.1.2. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will forward the international agreement and
      indicate applicable implementing documents to the appropriate standardization activity
      (AF code 11, 16, 68, 70, 71, or 84). The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will maintain a copy of
      all international agreements that have AFMC interest.
      35.3.1.3. The standardization activity focal point will maintain a copy of all applicable
      international agreements and forward the agreement, indicating applicable implementing
      documents, to the engineering action office. The engineering action office is suspended,
      by the standardization activity, to initiate a project for implementation of the agreement
      within 30 days. Additional copies of international agreements, which may be required,
      can be obtained from the Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS), Bldg. 4D, 700
      Robins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111- 5094 by written request on letterhead
      stationery. Copies may also be obtained online from the Acquisition Streamlining and
      Standardization Information System (ASSIST) database.
      35.3.1.4. Implementation of an agreement is signified by the standardization activity's
      receipt of an amendment, revision, etc., which incorporates the agreement within the
      implementing document. Standardization activities (AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS) will ensure
      the provisions of this manual are complied with prior to forwarding the document to
      DAPS for action.
      35.3.1.5. Standardization activities will ensure subsequent changes to the implementing
      document do not affect that portion containing the international STANAG.
      35.3.1.6. AFMC standardization activities will notify the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS of the
      implementation date and the documents affected.
      35.3.1.7. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS will notify the ISO of the method and date of
      implementation.
      35.3.1.8. International agreements, relating to DOD Standard Drawing Practices
      (DRPR), DOD Engineering Data Reproduction Systems (EDRS), Engineering Data
      Systems (EDS), and Technical Manual Specifications and Standards (TMSS), are
      implemented by the AF Product Data Systems Modernization Office (Code 16).
35.4. Publication Annotation Procedures. Each publication, which implements a STANAG,
is annotated to clearly indicate the agreement it implements. According to the USAF
International Military Standardization Programs, AFI 60-101 instructions apply:
 140                                                 AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


   35.4.1. PAs are responsible for implementing international standardization agreements as
   they relate to their responsibilities. Note: Implementation of international standardization
   agreements extends beyond a statement of international interest before the concluding
   materiel. The requirements of the agreements must be incorporated to the point of exclusion
   of portions of the implementing document that may be in conflict with the agreement. If this
   implementation cannot be accomplished, the working party chairperson, for the particular
   agreement, must be notified so a reservation concerning the sections of the implementing
   document in conflict can be filed for the USAF.
   35.4.2. When military documents (e.g., specifications, standard, MS sheets, or handbooks)
   reference international standardization agreements as part of their requirements, the
   following statement will be added before the concluding materiel activity symbols: "Certain
   provisions of this document (identified by paragraph number or similar manner, if
   appropriate) are subject to international standardization agreement (insert the ABCA or ASIC
   standard number, the STANAG number, or other appropriate documentary reference). When
   amendment, revision, or cancellation of this document is proposed, which will modify the
   international agreement concerned, the preparing activity takes appropriate action through
   international standardization channels, including the DepSO, to change the agreement or
   make other appropriate accommodations."
   35.4.3. If a specification or a standard includes drawings, the drawings will contain the
   following statement: "International Interest-See specification or standard (insert document
   identifier). Consult the PA before any revision."
   35.4.4. When a non-government document is identified as being a part of an international
   agreement, the following paragraph will be included in the acceptance notice before the
   concluding materiel activity symbols: "NOTICE: Certain provisions of this document are the
   subject of an International Standardization Agreement (identify fully). When validation,
   amendment, revision, or cancellation of this document is proposed, the military coordinating
   activity takes the appropriate action through military international standardization channels,
   including the DepSO, as required."
35.5. Agreement Deviations. Deviations will not be made from a standardization agreement or
any implementing documents without prior consultation with (or, in an emergency, notification
of) the signatory nations. If an AFMC organization must deviate from a USAF-ratified
agreement, it will send a deviation request to the AF/ISO. The AFMC PA will forward requests
for deviation, through their standardization activity to the AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS.

        INTERCHANGEABILITY AND SUBSTITUTABILITY (I&S) PROGRAM

36.1. Purpose. The I&S Program documents and distributes item relationship data, approved
for all applications, within the AF. By identifying related items of supply and providing an
orderly attrition process, the I&S data is utilized in the procurement, management, and disposal
of items in the AF and DOD inventories. The AF I&S Program interfaces with the DOD I&S
Program. The DOD program establishes a standardized process for the collaboration,
establishment, recordation, interpretation, distribution, and interservice support of items within
the I&S Program. The AF I&S Program also provides visibility of item relationships that, for
various reasons, cannot be established as DOD relationships.
   36.1.1. I&S relationships recorded in FLIS have been coordinated with all applicable DOD
   users. The PICA ES has responsibility to coordinate and establish the I&S family, but each
   I&S activity has the ability to record their own Order of Use (OOU). AF I&S activities will
   record their OOU within the guidelines of this chapter. When this information is recorded in
   FLIS, it is also recorded in the AF Master Item Identification Control System (MIICS/D043),
   J Increment. DOD I&S information is visible through FLIS, D043, FEDLOG, at
   https://www.dlis.dla.mil/webflis/sec/niin_search.aspx and the Management Data (MD)
   I&S CD-ROM. The DOD and AF I&S information is also distributed from D043 to
   interfacing AF logistics systems.
   36.1.2. The AF maintains I&S relationships on items that cannot be established as DOD
   relationships in FLIS. These relationships are recorded in D043, visible in D043A, and
   distributed to interfacing AF logistics data systems. These relationships include P-, S-, X-,
   and R-Files.
   36.1.3. Visibility of I&S Data in D043A.
       36.1.3.1. D043A Selected Data Screen. The D043A Selected Data Screen includes a
       field labeled ―I/S IND.‖ This element indicates if the screened item is included in an I&S
       relationship. Values for this field are shown in Figure 36.4
       36.1.3.2. D043A J Increment. The ―J‖ Increment for the master item indicates the type
       of group established (J, P, or S) and lists all group members and their associated OOU
       and Jump-To-Codes (JTCs). If a related item has a Numeric Parts Preference Code
       (NPPC) recorded, it will be displayed as the last position of the OOU field (see AFMAN
       23-110, V2, P2, C27). If the item being screened is AF-managed, the ―J‖ Increment will
       also display the I&S data for the other military services that are supported by the AF. If
       the item being screened is a related item, the ―J‖ increment will display the master item
       followed by ―MST‖ in the OOU field.
       36.1.3.3. D043A X File Screen. The ―X‖ File Screen shows established relationships
       that cannot be recorded in a group because of a data incompatibility. There are fields that
       show the relationship and incompatibility codes. Values for these codes are shown in
       Figure 36.1. and Figure 36.2. The ―X‖ File can include NSNs, and Kit (K) numbers.
       36.1.3.4. The D043A ―R ―File. The ―R‖ File shows research results that were submitted
       as base inquiries. The Reply Code and Explanation fields provide detailed information of

36.2. Policy. It is the responsibility of the ES to develop, maintain current, and use, to the
maximum extent practical the AF functions of I&S data. This policy applies to all items of
supply in which the AF has an interest regardless of PICA assignment.
   36.2.1. Item relationships are determined and applied according to the criteria and
   procedures provided herein. When established, such relationships constitute AF approved
   I&S data.
   36.2.2. Interchangeable items should be consolidated under a single NSN when:
       36.2.2.1. Items don‘t require stocking of peculiar components or parts.
       36.2.2.2. Items are piece parts and not subject to further disassembly (e.g., resistor, bolt,
       washer).
       36.2.2.3. Items, properly identified as Source Control Drawings according to ASME
       Y14.100, Engineering Drawing Practices, will not be grouped with other items of supply
       unless the manufacturer issues a drawing change to add the alternate item as approved for
       this application.
36.3. Responsibility.
   36.3.1. The AFGLSC‘s 401 SCMS is assigned primary responsibility for I&S Program
   accomplishment and, as the OPR, will:
       36.3.1.1. Prepare and distribute guidance, technical criteria, and procedures necessary for
       the development and maintenance of item I&S relationship and records determination.
       36.3.1.2. Program and schedule I&S programs and workloads.
       36.3.1.3. Maintain staff surveillance over the implementation of these procedures to
       include:
          36.3.1.3.1. Compliance, adequacy, and quality of determinations, coverage, and
          distribution media.
          36.3.1.3.2. Maximum use of I&S data in controlling the entry of new items into the
          inventory and by identifying unneeded or less desirable items in a like manner that
          will assist in their orderly attrition from the inventory.
          36.3.1.3.3. Compatibility of the program and its products in relation to DOD, AF,
          and AFMC materiel management programs and objectives.
       36.3.1.4. Provide procedural guidance and maintain administrative control over those
       matters of a mission nature which relate to the I&S Program. Such guidance and control
       is provided consistent with related DOD, AF, and AFMC materiel management programs
       and objectives. This includes:
          36.3.1.4.1. Exercising control over changes and additions to the system specifications
          and requirements.
          36.3.1.4.2. Ensuring the system and its products are adequate, compatible, and
          responsive in relation to other materiel management system programs and objectives.
          36.3.1.4.3. Preparing and submitting CSRDs, is accomplished using ISMT, to affect
          changes and additions to the system specification.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               145


           36.3.1.4.4. The AF I&S activities will implement and support the policies,
           procedures, and objectives of the I&S program as they apply to their commodity areas
           and mission assignments as defined in Table 36.4 Organizational components,
           responsible for acquiring, computing, requisitioning, issuing, and authorizing items,
           will ensure program support through the maximum use of I&S data. Program
           implementation and maintenance responsibilities are as outlined in Table 36.4.

         accomplished using JLC Form 47, DOD I&S Family Collaboration Request.
         36.3.2.2.3. Items that have an established Item Standardization relationship require
         no further collaboration to establish an I&S family.
      36.3.2.3. Establish and maintain, on a current basis, item relationship records and files as
      prescribed herein. Ensure their quality and compatibility, both technically and
      administratively.

      21-1, AFMC Technical Order System Procedures and TO 00-5-15-WA-1, AF Time
      Compliance      Technical     Order     Process    (at   https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
      af61/ETIMS/ETIMS/menu/index.jsp).
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                   147


      36.3.3.2. Make maximum use of I&S resources and information in the accomplishment
      of assigned materiel management functions (e.g., stock control and distribution,
      determination of new and/or follow on materiel requirements, etc.).
      36.3.3.3. Collaborate, as required, in the development, determination, and/or
      implementation of I&S relationship decisions to ensure that maintenance, engineering,
      and supply support are not adversely affected. Where such support functions would be
      adversely impacted, advise other I&S activity and/or submit alternatives. Refer inquiries
      and/or matters of an I&S nature to the I&S activity responsible for the commodity or
      subject involved.
      36.3.3.4. Initiate supply catalog change requests to implement I&S determinations and/or

   36.3.4. The ALC Engineering Activity will:
      36.3.4.1. Provide engineering support, when requested, in the development and/or use of
      I&S data in logistic operations. Such support includes developing and providing I&S
      criteria for use in making I&S determinations within assigned commodity areas and the
      review and evaluation of I&S decisions involving items considered to be ―engineering
      critical‖ because of safety, reliability, performance, integrity of design, and/or system
      compatibility factors.
      36.3.4.2. Advise the appropriate I&S activity of new or anticipated TCTOs and their
      effective and rescission dates within 10 working days of publication or rescission.
36.4. Research and Determinations.
   36.4.1. Research technical studies and decisions for I&S encompass the research and
   evaluation of the physical, functional, qualitative, and/or operational capabilities of the items
   involved. For I&S purposes, these capabilities are expressed and evaluated in terms of the
   technical characteristics of an item. Technicians, as required, obtain test data, make physical
   comparisons and coordinate with other organizations or activities. Such actions are effected
   through oral or written communication or through personal visits to government, contractor,
   or vendor facilities to obtain the necessary installation, demonstration, and/or test data not
   otherwise available. Research of source documents for I&S purposes include, but are not
   necessarily limited to, bills of materiel, TOs and manuals, federal cataloging records, parts
   catalogs, government and/or manufacturers‘ standards, specifications, and engineering
   drawings, procurement documents, engineering change proposals and orders, supply
   catalogs, provisioning documentation, and the use and application of data contained in
   engineering and design handbooks.
   36.4.2. Determinations are the result of an I&S analytical comparisons of the technical
   characteristics inherent in the item involved. These determinations may be positive or
   negative. Positive determinations are expressed in terms, which indicate the degree, or
   conditions under which the items may be interchanged one for the other. Technical
   characteristics, for the purpose of I&S determinations, are those features that an item must
   possess to be capable of being interchanged. Included are characteristics pertinent to
 148                                                 AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


   materiel, form, fit, function, operational speeds or frequencies, environmental conditions,
   reliability compatibility, motivation, inputs, and other commodity peculiarities that would
   preclude or limit the interchange of items. I&S determinations resulting from such
   comparisons are within accepted engineering practices, authorized tolerances, and/or
   maintainability requirements as established by the contractual requirements of the procuring
   document.
36.5. Records and Files. The responsible I&S activity ES will establish and maintain item
relationship records for assigned commodities. These records reflect findings resulting from I&S
research and constitute an approved source of I&S data. Such records are established and
maintained to fully document the I&S findings and pertinent data. Documentation includes I&S
findings resulting from research, evaluation, and comparisons of the technical characteristics of
the item involved and the purpose for which the items were designed. The following type
records are established and maintained according to the conditions prescribed:
   36.5.1. I&S Records (D043B). I&S relationships that meet the criteria for inclusion in the
   mechanized system are recorded by this media when all known relationships can be fully
   depicted. In the event such relationships cannot be fully depicted and/or a more detailed
   record is necessary, a supplemental record in the form of the D043 ISDR is prepared.
   36.5.2. D043 ISDR. This record is used to document and maintain I&S findings and/or data
   that cannot be fully and/or properly reflected in the D043B I&S Records. The record is
   stored in the D043 and can be interrogated from the D043A Main Menu. In general, these
   records are used when:
       36.5.2.1. An NSL item is subject to a technical research and evaluation on an item-to-
       item basis (e.g. a NSL item is researched and technical characteristics are compared with
       a similar NSL or NSN item).
       36.5.2.2. An item is deleted from the mechanized I&S System when it is no longer AF
       used. Records prepared on these type items reflect the NSN of the active item, which
       supersedes or replaces the inactive item.
       36.5.2.3. A backup record is necessary to retain data relative to origin or source data,
       coordination obtained, inquiries or challenges requiring revalidation, notations of major
       differences found, item application, etc.
36.6. Processing of Inquiries and Resolution of Controversies. The processing of inquiries
and/or the resolution of controversies is a continuing function of each I&S activity in their
assigned commodity areas. Requests from field units, management sources, contractors, etc.,
relative to I&S data published and/or furnished for use in automated programs, are an important
factor in achieving optimum and valid relationships. Inquiries received are processed in a timely
manner and the findings coordinated with responsible components when maintenance,
engineering, and/or management considerations exist. Such coordination is important in the
resolution of controversies and/or in the establishment of an AFMC USAF position with respect
to the acceptability of other S/As‘ offerings of substitute items.
36.7. Generic NSN Management.
   36.7.1. Purpose.
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 149


       36.7.1.1. Generic standardization relationships are established to provide supply
       management control of repairable items. Internal configuration differences, requiring
       different repair parts during depot or contractor repair, require separate NSNs to identify
       each repairable item.
       36.7.1.2. The generic master NSN is used to consolidate requirements. It is for
       acquisition purposes only and not a designated location where DOD assets are stored
       under the generic master NSN.
   36.7.2. Generic Relationships.
       36.7.2.1. The generic master NSN will have an AAC of ―W‖ and an ISC of ―1‖
       (procurable).
       36.7.2.2. Repairable items of supply, related to a generic master NSN, will:
           36.7.2.2.1. Be fully interchangeable.
           36.7.2.2.2. Be the requisitioned items and have recorded assets.
           36.7.2.2.3. Be linked to the generic master with a phrase code ―S‖ (on master
           indicating related) and interlinked, between the related, with phrase code ―J.‖
           36.7.2.2.4. Have an ISC of 2 and indicate the generic master NSN with a phrase code
           3.
Note: ISC 2 items may replace ISC 3 items of older configuration or having less capabilities that
are no longer procured.
   36.7.3. Application.
       36.7.3.1. Use of generic standardization relationships is restricted to repairable items
       acquired under military/federal specifications, including CIDs.
       36.7.3.2. I&S Activities will ensure generic relationships are restricted according to DSP
       Policies and Procedures, DOD Manual 4120.24-M and FLIS Procedures Manual, DOD
       4100.39-M, during IEC review.
36.8. Establishing an I&S Relationship. The establishment of the I&S relationship in D043 is
necessary to implement the mechanical substitution and distribution processes with the AF
logistics systems. The ―J‖ Record is the preferred type of I&S relationship, followed by the ―P‖
and ―S‖ Records, and finally, the ―X‖ File. Any positive ―R‖ File relationships should be
recorded in the appropriate file above.
   36.8.1. Establishing an I&SG. The following edits must be executed to record items in an
   I&SG.
       36.8.1.1. A group may not exceed 50 items.
       36.8.1.2. All members of a group must have the same FSC.
       36.8.1.3. If the master item is AF-managed and has a CIIC (formerly Security/Pilferage
       Code), all related items must have the same CIIC, except for CIICs ―7‖ and ―U‖ which
       may be commingled in the same I&SG.
150                                                AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010


      36.8.1.4. If a member of an I&SG has a MMAC, all group members must have the same
      MMAC. The only exceptions are MMACs ―VG,‖ ―VH,‖ and ―VL,‖ which can be mixed
      with other MMACs that are managed at the same ALC.
      36.8.1.5. If the master item has an AAC of ―N,‖ ―V,‖ or ―Y,‖ all related items must have
      AAC of ―N,‖ ―V,‖ or ―Y.‖
      36.8.1.6. The master item cannot have AAC ―T.‖
      36.8.1.7. If a group member has AAC ―F‖ or ―L,‖ all group members must have the
      same AAC with the following exceptions: AAC ―F‖ or‖ L‖ may be used with AAC of‖
      V‖ or ―Y.‖ If master item is AAC ―W,‖ then the related item may be ―F‖ or ―L‖.
      36.8.1.8. Related items may not have AAC ―W.‖
      36.8.1.9. FMS items are not allowed in I&SGs.
      36.8.1.10. All MOE rules on related NSNs must also be recorded on the master NSN.
      This applies only if the recorded MOE rule LOA is 02, 06, or 22 and the MOE rule
      begins with A, F, M, or N.
      36.8.1.11. If the master item has a pilferable code, all group members must have a
      pilferable code.
  36.8.1.12. The master item cannot have an ISC of ―3‖ or ―E‖.
      36.8.1.13. If the master item is AF-managed, all group members must have the same
      ERRC code, except for ERRC codes ―S‖ and ―U.‖ These ERRC code can be mixed in the
      same I&S family.
      36.8.1.14. If the master item is AF-managed, all group members must have the same U/I.
      36.8.1.15. All members of a group must have the same SOS.
  36.8.2. Selection of Master Items. A master item is selected for each I&S group based upon
  the criteria established. Items assigned an AAC of ―W‖ are selected as master items when
  they represent the item of supply which best satisfies the AF requirement as represented by
  the I&SG. A master item of an I&SG must be at least a suitable substitute for all other
  members of the group.
  36.8.3. Selection of Subgroups. Subgroups are comprised of one or more items. The
  quantity and/or selection of items for inclusion in a given subgroup, the number of subgroups
  required, and the arrangement of each subgroup within an I&SG depends on the number of
  items involved and their capability to be interchanged. Subgroups must conform to the
  following conditions:
      36.8.3.1. When two or more items are selected for inclusion in the same subgroup they
      must be interchangeable.
      36.8.3.2. AF-managed items are assigned a NPPC when a TCTO is established against
      that item. These codes and their meanings are as follows:
         36.8.3.2.1. Code ―4.‖ A code assigned to an active item of supply requiring
         modification and re-identification according to an active TO/TCTO. Modified items
         are not retained in the same subgroup with the unmodified items since the
AFMCMAN23-3 14 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                 151


          interchangeability relationship has been changed by the modification. When an
          NPPC ―4‖ is applied to an NSN, a phrase code ―R‖ is input concurrently to the CMD
          record reflecting the prescribing TO/TCTO. The ―R‖ phrase code will begin with
          ―4TO‖ as the first four positions, immediately followed by the TCTO number.
          Additional lines will also begin with ―4TO,‖ if required.
          36.8.3.2.2. Code ―9.‖ A code assigned to an item of supply found to be unacceptable
          for AF use.
       36.8.3.3. Subgroups comprised solely of unsuitable items always precede all other
       subgroups in an I&SG.
       36.8.3.4. Subgroups are arranged in alphabetical sequence based on the desirability of
       retention of the items within the I&SG. The first subgroup contains those items least
       desired for retention in stock. Subsequent subgroups are arranged in descending order as
       the retention desirability increases. The subgroup containing the master item is always
       the last subgroup in the I&SG.
       36.8.3.5. Subgroups are identified by a two-position alphabetic code, sequentially
       assigned in descending order (AA, AB, AC, etc.), starting with the subgroup least desired
       for retention.
   36.8.4. Establishment of Order or Preference. An order of preference is established for
   items within each subgroup to accommodate management decisions and to provide a means
   of establishing an OOU code capable of both manual and computer computation.
       36.8.4.1. Subgroup order of preference is established by selecting the item least desired
       for stock retention as the first item in the subgroup. Any remaining items are assigned in
       descending sequence as the desirability for retention increases; that is, from the least to
       the most desired (primary) item in the subgroup. Within the master item subgroup the
       master item will always have the highest OOU listed.
       36.8.4.2. Based on the order of preference established, each suitable item within the
       subgroup is assigned a one-position alphabetic parts preference (PP) code. This code is
       assigned sequentially and in descending order beginning with the least preferred item in
       the subgroup, i.e. A, B, C, D, through Z.
       36.8.4.3. OOU Codes. The OOU code consists of a three-position alphanumeric code
       constructed from the two-position subgroup (SG) code and the one-position PP code. On
       items assigned a NPPC, that code is converted to ‗A‘ in FLIS (i.e., AA9 in D043 will be
       AAA in FLIS).
36.9. Examples of I&S Relationships. Figures 36.1. through 36.9. represent notional data and
may or may not be in an I&S relationship
   36.9.1. Figure 36.1. interprets the D043A J increment. It identifies where to locate the type
   of I&SG, other S/A I&S data, what NIIN is being interrogated, Master Item OOU and Least
   Preferred Item OOU.

    36.9.3. The NSNs shown in Figure 36.3. are recorded in different subgroups (AA_, AB_,
    and AC_) and are, therefore substitutable. The item with OOU ABA can be used in all
    applications that call for the item with OOU AAA, and the master item (ACA), can be used
    for all applications for either AAA or ABA. AAA cannot be used in place of ABA or ACA,
    and ABA cannot be used in place of ACA.

   AC) and are, therefore, substitutable. Because of the JTC recorded on the AAA item, AAA
   cannot be replaced by ABA, but it can be replaced by ACA. ABA can be replaced by ACA
   but not AAA. ACA cannot be replaced by either AAA or ABA.

     Substitutable
   36.9.5. Items shown in Figure 36.5. show an example of a NPPC 4. The NPPC shows up in
   the last position of the OOU for the item. This example shows a substitutable relationship.
   Item AA4 is being modified and will no longer be issued in its present configuration. The
   modified item will contain the NIIN associated with the ADA JTC. Item AA4 can be
   replaced only by item ADA. Item ABA can only be replaced by ADA. ACA is also replaced
   by ADA. None of the items (AA4, ABA, ACA) can be used in applications that specify
   ADA.

   36.9.7. Figure 36.7. represents a generic family. The master item, (AAE), represents a
   performance requirement, not an actual item of supply. The items with orders of use AAA-
   AAD are the items supplied to the specifications identified with the generic master. All items
   in the group are completely interchangeable. To differentiate an interchangeable relationship
   from a generic relationship, you must examine the AAC of the master item. A generic
   master will always have an AAC of ―W.‖

   36.9.8. Figure 36.8. shows two different degrees of relationships with one master. Item AAA
   can be replaced by either ABA or ABB. It cannot be used in applications specifying ABA or
   ABB. Items ABA and ABB are completely interchangeable and can be used in place of each
   other as well as item AAA.

   36.9.9. Figure 36.9. shows a master item (ABA) that is a substitute for the related
   items(AAA-AAF). It can be used in all applications that specify any of the related items, but
   the related items cannot be used in applications that specify the master. The related items are
   all interchangeable with each other.

and administration of QPLs and QML. The PA retains responsibility and approval authority for
the work accomplished.
Bachelor Item— Item of supply which is not recorded in an I&S relationship.
Command Standardization Office (ComSO)— Office in HQ AFMC that is responsible for all
command standardization activities in support of the DSP and the DepSO, as identified in 60-
101.
Custodian— The activity responsible for resolving and consolidating coordination comments
for standardization documents or studies in its department or agency, and submitting those
comments to the PA.
Departmental Standardization Office (DepSO)— Top level office in each military department
or defense agency responsible for managing the DSP and ensuring that its LSAs and SMAs

properly implement the policies, procedures, and goals of the DSP. The DepSO develops
departmental policies and procedures to implement standardization.
Generic Item— NSN which applies to a Military, Federal, or adopted industry specification or
standard which is used to procure actual items of supply that meet the specification or standard.
Assets are not stocked under the generic NSN. The generic item does not represent an actual
item of supply, but defines the performance of the items procured under the specification or
standard. NSN are coded with an AAC ―W.‖
Generic Specific Item— Actual item of supply that has been procured under a specification or
standard that defines performance criteria. These items are grouped as interchangeable with the
generic master.
I&S Decision Record (ISDR)— Clear text record, accessible through the D043 System, which
records information to support I&S decisions.
I&S Family— Represents an entity of items that possess physical and functional characteristics
to provide comparable performance for a given requirement under given conditions. Also, the
full range of items, determined by the managing or using services and agencies (S/A), to have
unconditional interchangeable or substitutable relationships with each other and for which a
common master item is a suitable replacement.
I&S Group— Grouping of items possessing such physical and functional characteristics to
provide comparable functional performance for any given application. Such items are identified
as interchangeable or substitutable and are arranged in descending order to the item preferred
most for retention in the inventory. Note: For I&S purposes, the terms I&S family and I&S
group have the same meaning.
I&S Phrase Codes— Phrase Codes used in FLIS and the D043 System that accompany an
OOU. Phrase Codes are E, F, G, J, S, U, 3, 7 and <blank>.
Inherent Characteristics— Physical and functional qualities that describe the intended use,
operating conditions, tolerances and range, purpose, and capability of an item. Such factors serve
as the basis for determining which items may be treated as interchangeable or substitutable.
Interchangeable Relationship— Two or more items of supply that can be used in place of each
other in all applications, without modification, other than adjustment. The form, fit, and function
of these items are identical. These items will be recorded in the same subgroup. Requisitions
against any item in the subgroup can be filled by any item in the subgroup.
Item Identifier— Identity of a cataloged or non-cataloged item for which a relationship is
reflected in an X-Record relationship. It is normally the non-preferred item in an X-Record
relationship.
J—Record – Fully coordinated and approved DOD I&S relationship. I&S Phrase Codes and
OOU will be recorded in both FLIS and D043. I&S information is also visible in FEDLOG and
on the MD I&S CD-ROM product.
Jump—To-Code (JTC) – Three position code used to denote an exception to the normal,
progressive I&S relationships which pertain to an I&S family. The presence and value of a JTC
identifies items which have no I&S relationship with each other, but do have a common
substitutable item in the family.

Lead Service Activity— Military department or agency delegated responsibility for the
development, preparation, and implementation of the DSP in an assigned area. Area
assignments are listed in the SD—1. Major responsibilities are to prepare the area program
plan, assign project numbers, and decide unresolved comments elevated by PAs/custodians. This
term was replaced by lead standardization activity (LSA).
Lead Standardization Activity (LSA)— Former terms ―assignee activity‖ and ―lead service
activity‖ were combined under the new term ―lead standardization activity.‖ A management
activity in a military department or defense agency that guides DOD standardization efforts, for
an FSG, an FSC, or a standardization area, through the development of standardization program
plans, authorization of standardization projects, and identification and resolution of
standardization issues.
Master Item— Item in an I&S family which is commonly regarded, by the managing and using
S/A, as a suitable replacement for all other items in the family and as the preferred item for
acquisition purposes. Note: Within a family headed by a generic master, the generic NSN is
always designated as the master.
Military Coordinating Activity (MCA)— Military activity responsible for DOD coordinating,
reconciling, and consolidating military comments for the DOD on a Federal Standardization
document prepared by a civilian agency.
Order of Use (OOU)— Three-position code that is assigned to I&S items in order to array the
items in ascending order of preference.
P-Record— I&S relationship which is valid for all Air Force applications, but which has not
been approved by other services for their applications. The Air Force is the manager of all group
members. The D043 will reflect an OOU, but no I&S Phrase Codes. The relationship is visible in
FEDLOG, but not in FLIS.
Participating Activity— Activity responsible for resolving and consolidating coordination
comments on standardization program plans in its military DOD agency, and submitting those
comments to the LSA.
Parts Preference Code— Third position of the OOU Code. This code shows the Order of
Preference of items recorded in the same subgroup.
Preparing Activity (PA)— DOD activity or the civilian agency responsible for the preparation,
coordination, issuance, and maintenance of standardization documents.
Provisioning Support Office/Cataloging Manager (PSO/CATM)— AFGLSC function,
located at each of the ALCs, responsible for managing and validating cataloging actions and
ensures supporting documents/technical data is provided to cataloging activities.
R-Record— I&S record which is built in response to an inquiry generated when a requisition is
filled by an item other than what was ordered.
Related Item— Item of supply which has functional or physical characteristics which render it a
lower order of preference for use than that accorded to the master item of an I&S family.
The identifying NSN of the item for which a relationship is reflected in an X—Record
relationship. Normally the preferred item in an X-Record relationship.

Review Activity— SMA having a technical or procurement interest in a standardization
document, thus requiring a review of all proposed actions affecting it.
S—Record – I&S relationship which is valid for all Air Force applications, but which has not
been recorded in FLIS by the manager. The Air Force is not the manager of the master item. The
D043 will reflect an OOU, but no I&S Phrase Codes. The relationship is visible in FEDLOG, but
not in FLIS.
Standardization Management Activity (SMA)— Generic term to describe any DOD activity
listed in the SD-1 that functions as an LSA, PA, participating activity, MCA, custodian, review
activity, adopting activity, or item reduction activity.
Subgroup Code— First two positions of the OOU Code. All items recorded in the same
subgroup are interchangeable. Items assigned different subgroups have some form of
substitutability.
Substitutable Relationship— Two or more items of supply that are similar, but one of the items
has inherent characteristics that make it preferred over the other item. The preferred item can
replace the non-preferred item for all applications, but the non-preferred item is not authorized
for use in applications that designate the preferred item. These items will be recorded in different
subgroups, with the preferred item being in the highest subgroup. Requisitions submitted against
the non-preferred item can be filled by the preferred item, but the non-preferred item cannot be
used to fill requisitions against the preferred item.
X—Record – I&S relationship which is valid for all Air Force applications, but some
incompatibility exists that prevents the relationship from being recorded in an I&S family (J-, P-,
or S Record).
