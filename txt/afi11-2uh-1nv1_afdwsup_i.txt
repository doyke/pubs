SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change corrects conflicts between this AFI and other governing AFIs, removes
flight surgeon and medical technician currency requirements and pilots’ aerial gunnery
requirements from Table 9, removes conflicting flight surgeon ARMS identifiers from Table 10,
and adds an FCF certification for Flight Engineers and non-aircraft commander pilots. It also
incorporates Administrative Change 1 reflecting AFGSC as the new L-MAJCOM for UH-1Ns
and OPR for this AFI

(AFDW) This document deletes the Mission Capabilities table, realigns and deletes erroneous
data on the Aircrew Training Requirements Summary table and changes the Mission
Qualification Flying Currency/Events Requirements in table to mirror the new guidance.

1. General Information. This instruction outlines ground and flying training requirements for
pilots (P), flight engineers (FE), aerial gunners (AG), aerial photographers (AP), flight surgeons
(FS), and operational support flyers (OSF) assigned/attached to UH-1N helicopter units. It
establishes minimum requirements/authorizations for the certification, qualification and training
of those crewmembers. This instruction does not authorize deviations from the flight manual or
other 11-series instructions. Throughout this AFI references are made to MAJCOM and NAF
levels of responsibilities. Due to the diverse nature of the structure of UH-1N units all references
to MAJCOM, NAF or a particular MAJCOM or NAF office are intended to mean that office or
equivalent. MAJCOM supplements to this AFI will indicate if there is a different office of
responsibility.
   1.1. Waiver Authority. The MAJCOM/A3 (including AFDW/A3) is the waiver authority
   for provisions of this instruction unless otherwise indicated. Request waivers to this
   instruction through applicable training channels to MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent level.
   MAJCOM/A3s (including AFDW/A3) will forward a courtesy copy of any waivers to HQ
   AFGSC/A3TO. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be handled by the MAJCOM
   (including AFDW) agency that generated the supplement.
   1.1. (AFDW) Process waivers for the basic AFI through stan/eval channels to HQ
   AFDW/A3/5/9. Waiver authority for this supplement is HQ AFDW/A3OV unless otherwise
   stated.

    1.2. Responsibilities:
       1.2.1. HQ USAF/A3O. See AFI 11-202V1.
       1.2.2. MAJCOMs.
           1.2.2.1. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). AFGSC is the lead command
           MAJCOM for UH-1N helicopters IAW AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and
           Responsibilities for
           1.2.2.2. Air Education and Training Command (AETC). AETC functions as the
           Training Command with duties IAW AFI 11-202V1.
           1.2.2.3. All MAJCOMs.
              1.2.2.3.1. Determine training requirements for day-to-day, contingency and
              wartime operations.
              1.2.2.3.2. Supplement/waive this instruction as applicable.
              1.2.2.3.3. Develop supplements as required.      MAJCOM/A3T will review
              supplements prior to publication. All MAJCOM supplements will be forwarded
              through HQ AFGSC/A3TO to AF/A3O-AT for approval. Provide notification of
              final AF/A3O-AT-approved supplements to HQ AFGSC/A3TO upon posting on
              the e-publishing website. If not posted on e-publishing provide final copies of
              AF/A3O-AT-approved supplements to HQ AFGSC/A3TO.
              1.2.2.3.3. (AFDW) AFDW/A3OV functions as the MAJCOM/A3T.
       1.2.3. Units:
           1.2.3.1. Ensure that flight safety considerations take precedence over the
           requirements and guidance in this instruction.
           1.2.3.2. Develop and administer training programs.
              1.2.3.2.1. Complete ground and flight training with minimum interruption and in
              the prescribed sequence.
              1.2.3.2.2. Use applicable formal school courseware for in-unit training. Units are
              not required to use courseware material requiring resources not available in the
              unit. When formal school courseware does not exist, the MAJCOM or NAF must
              ensure courseware is developed and standardized. Courseware should parallel
              formal school courseware in format and content.
                  1.2.3.2.2.1. Units will fly the formal course syllabus individual sortie flying
                  time as closely as possible. This does not preclude a student from receiving
                  less total syllabus time due to proficiency advancement. Time allotted per
                  sortie in formal courseware is designed for the (average) student to achieve
                  the Required Proficiency Level (RPL) for each maneuver during that sortie.
                  RPLs need to be met within allotted time as defined by the formal syllabus. If
                  RPLs are not met during allotted time, the student will be graded in
                  accordance with syllabus guidelines. Once RPLs are met, if additional time is
                  available other training may be accomplished beyond that programmed for the
                  sortie.

             1.2.3.2.3. For active duty service commitments (ADSC) refer to AFI 36-2107,
             Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC).
         1.2.3.3. Identify training shortfalls through MAJCOM channels.
         1.2.3.3. (AFDW) Forward training shortfall reports through the 811 OG/OGV to
         HQ AFDW/A3OV.
     1.2.4. Chief of Training:
         1.2.4.1. Implement the provisions of this instruction.
         1.2.4.2. Inform commanders of factors adversely affecting aircrew training and
         currency requirements.
         1.2.4.3. Coordinate with Safety and Stan/Eval offices to improve training and correct
         deficiencies.
         1.2.4.3. (AFDW) 1 HS/DOT will review quarterly trend information provided by 1
         HS/DOV.
         1.2.4.4. Identify areas requiring additional training and direct training accordingly.
         1.2.4.5. Ensure training objectives are prebriefed, debriefed and evaluated to
         determine successful accomplishment.
  1.3. Definitions, Abbreviations and Acronyms. Terms used in this instruction are
  explained in Attachment 1.
  1.4. Training Records and Reports. Establish and maintain aircrew member training records
  IAW AFI 11-202 volumes, 37 series instructions, this instruction, and appropriate MAJCOM
  directives.
  1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
     1.5.1. Safety/Operational Risk Management (ORM). Training programs/missions
     will be designed to achieve the highest degree of mission readiness/capability consistent
     with flight safety and resource availability. Units must fully engage the tenants of ORM
     to ensure that training risks do not outweigh benefits, but that realistic training is
     achieved whenever possible. Lessons learned from recent like-MDS mishaps should be
     integrated where possible in training plans/programs.
     1.5.2. Mission Scenarios. Units will develop and maintain mission scenarios that
     emphasize procedures and operations based on the unit’s mission.
  1.6. In-flight Supervision. Aircrew members/OSFs that are noncurrent, unqualified, or in
  any training program (upgrade, certification, corrective action, duty familiarization, etc.)
  must fly under the supervision of an instructor in their crew position who is current and
  qualified/certified in those events. For the purposes of this paragraph flight engineers and
  aerial gunners are considered the same crew position for mission events. Instructor pilots
  must be at a set of controls while instructing other pilots flying in the front seat. Any
  instructor-qualified crewmember may instruct flight surgeons and OSFs. However the
  preferred method of instruction is by an instructor-qualified flight engineer or aerial gunner.
  In any case, all instruction will be done one-on-one in the crew cabin. Instructors must be
  current and qualified/certified in a specific event before instructing in that event.
6                                      AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012


    1.6. (AFDW) In - Flight Supervision. Instructors will be contingency mission certified a
    minimum of three months prior to instructing the contingency mission events. AFDW
    A3/5/9 waives the requirement for flight surgeon instruction to be done one-on-one in the
    crew cabin.
    1.7. Crew Member Utilization Policy:
       1.7.1. Unit Aircrew Capability. OG/CC will determine unit aircrew capabilities based on
       the unit’s mission [i.e. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ), Basic Mission Capable
       (BMC), or Mission Ready/Combat Mission Ready (MR/CMR)].
       1.7.2. Commanders and Key Staff Course. If a senior officer does not maintain BAQ,
       BMC, or MR/CMR status, then completion of a helicopter Commander and Key Staff
       Course is required before the senior officer is authorized to perform pilot duties
       (including indoctrination flight program). The primary method of completion is at the
       formal school. The alternate method of training is in-unit (if primary method is not
       available) using formal school courseware adapted to local training resources. The
       alternate method of training requires MAJCOM/A3 waiver. Units are not required to use
       courseware material and examinations requiring resources available only at the formal
       school or material unique to the formal school flying area. Completion of this course does
       not assign a qualification or currency requirement, since the course is merely an
       orientation to USAF helicopter operations and capabilities. Senior officers will not be
       designated in command and will fly with an instructor pilot at a set of controls.
       Passengers are not authorized when senior officers are in control of the aircraft.
       1.7.3. Flight Surgeons. Flight Surgeons will comply with AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew
       Training; AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; AFI 16-130,
       Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape (SERE) Program; and AFI 11-401, Aviation
       Management training and currency requirements. Units will use the ARMS identifier
       AC06 for the flight surgeon exam and it will be considered a grounding item.
       Additionally, flight surgeons are required to maintain currency in LL01, LL03, LL06, and
       T002. All ground training must be completed before the first duty familiarization flight.
    1.8. Supervisory Aircrew Personnel Training:
       1.8.1. Colonels and above. See paragraph 1.7.2
       1.8.2. Lt Col and below, below MAJCOM level. Individuals must be trained to the
       appropriate status as determined by the unit commander. The NAF functional manager
       for H-1 operations will determine the qualification for crewmembers assigned at NAF
       level. Individuals must meet or exceed all initial and recurring training requirements for
       the unit to which the individual is assigned.
       1.8.2. (AFDW) Crewmembers assigned to wing level and below positions with API
       Codes 6 or B will maintain MR/CMR status. HQ AFDW crewmembers assigned to API
       codes 8 or D positions will maintain MR/CMR status.
       1.8.3. Lt Col and below at the MAJCOM level. Incumbents to Aircrew Position
       Identifier (API) 8 positions must comply with AFI 11-202V1 and MAJCOM guidance.
       Individuals in the indoctrination-flying program have no qualification or currency
       requirements.
AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012                                                        7


  1.9. Intra/Intercommand Transfer of Aircrews. The unit commander or operations
  officer will review the training and evaluation records of newly assigned personnel to
  determine what training, if any, is required for them to achieve BMC or MR/CMR status.
  Previous assignments, formal training experience, and demonstrated performance should be
  taken into consideration.
  1.10. Intra/Intercommand Aircrew Training. Aircrew members may perform flying
  duties at H-1 units outside their assigned command. Local area orientation training must be
  accomplished IAW paragraph 1.11 The visiting aircrew member’s mission qualifications
  must be equivalent to the qualification requirements for the planned mission at the TDY
  location in order to perform aircrew duties on operational missions. Unit commanders or
  operations officers may identify additional requirements before TDY aircrew members act as
  primary crewmembers on operational or training missions. This provision allows instructors
  to perform aircrew training or students to receive flying training at units outside their
  assigned MAJCOM. Follow guidance for in-unit training programs as directed in this
  instruction to include waiver requests if applicable. See AFI 11-401, Aviation Management,
  paragraph 1.11 for guidance on authorization to perform inflight duties in non-US Air Force

     required by this instruction and/or AFI 36-2201 Volume 1, Training Development,
     Delivery, and Evaluation, the ETCA and the unit commander.
     5.2.2. Commanders must ensure that flight-training programs consider local conditions
     and individual capabilities to maximize training continuity. Effective training is founded
     on crewmembers’ confidence in basic skills such as navigation, systems operation, Night
     Vision Goggles (NVGs), formation, instruments, and low level. Training programs must
     include regular, recurring exposure to the fundamentals of the unit mission.
     5.2.3. MAJCOM supplements may allow provisions for the OG/CC to waive ground and
     flying continuation training.
     5.2.3. (AFDW) Waiver authority for ground and flying continuation training is the
     OG/CC.

     events/subevents in Table 1 through Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11 through
     Table 17 to credit currency for that item/sortie. Flight currency may be credited in the
     following two manners:
         5.2.4.1. Current and Qualified/Certified. Aircrew members and OSFs that are current
         and qualified/certified may credit currency if they perform the required
         events/subevents for that item/sortie.
            5.2.4.1.1. Mission pilots, aircraft commanders and instructor pilots may credit
            events/sorties accomplished in either seat.
            5.2.4.1.2. Pilots in any upgrade already current and qualified in a specific event
            may credit events/sorties accomplished in the upgrade towards continuation
            training at the discretion of the instructor.
            5.2.4.1.2. (AFDW) Any crewmember in any upgrade may credit events/sorties
            accomplished towards continuation training, if they are qualified in that event.
            5.2.4.1.3. Current and qualified pilots fulfilling ETCA prerequisites in the other
            pilot seat may credit events/sorties accomplished toward currency requirements at
            the instructor’s discretion.
            5.2.4.1.4. Events accomplished on satisfactory evaluations/certifications may be
            credited toward currency requirements.
            5.2.4.1.5. (Added-AFDW) Aircrew members qualified in the Mi-17 may credit
            the following events flown in the Mi-17 for Table 9 currencies and semiannual
            requirements:

         5.2.4.2. Non-Current. Aircrew members and OSFs delinquent in currency
         requirements must fly under the supervision of an instructor IAW paragraph 1.6 and
         perform sufficient repetitions of each delinquent item to demonstrate proficiency in
         all non-current events. Events performed to clear delinquent requirements may be
         credited to satisfy current training requirements at the instructor’s discretion.
  5.3. Training Cycle. The crewmember training cycle is 12 months, January through
  December, and the ground training cycle is IAW paragraph 5.4 Units will complete training
  requirements during the appropriate training cycle unless specifically noted otherwise.
  5.4. Ground Training. Table 1 through Table 8 list flight related ground training.
  MAJCOM supplements will identify those events not required.
     5.4.1. Training Currency and Due Date.

            prior to the end of the reference month will be used.
         5.4.1.2. Reference dates for each subject should remain fixed and will be established
         in writing and on file in the unit training office. Do not exceed a period of 17 months
         (to the end of the month) when converting from one method to another, or after initial
         qualification/certification, requalification, or recertification.
  5.5. BAQ Continuation Training Requirements:
     5.5.1. Pilots, Flight Engineers, Aerial Gunners, and Flight Surgeons. Crewmembers must
     comply with the requirements listed in Table 9 and Table 10 Currency requirements are
     minimums. If a crewmember goes non-current for a BAQ flying event, refer to paragraph
     5.10
AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012                                                  17

     directives.
  5.6. BMC Continuation Training Requirements:
     5.6.1. Pilots, Flight Engineers and Aerial Gunners. Pilots, flight engineers and aerial
     gunners will comply with the applicable currency requirements listed in Table 9 and
     Tables 11. through Table 17 required for BMC status as determined by the unit
     commander. Aircrew members who are current in BAQ events, but not in MQT events
     are considered BAQ and will not be authorized to perform the applicable mission
     event(s).
  5.7. MR/CMR Continuation Training Requirements:
     5.7.1. Pilots, Flight Engineers and Aerial Gunners. Pilots, flight engineers and aerial
     gunners will comply with the currency requirements listed in Table 9 and Tables 11.

     (MT) will accomplish the requirements in Table 9 and Table 11 through Table 17 Other
     OSFs will comply with MAJCOM directives.
  5.8. Multiple Qualification/Currency Requirements. Crewmembers authorized by their
  MAJCOM to maintain currency in multiple aircraft (to include series) must perform an
  equitable distribution of events in each aircraft. As a minimum, at least one emergency
  procedure sortie will be flown in their primary aircraft each quarter; MAJCOMs will
  determine currency requirements for secondary aircraft.
  5.9. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in special tactics or events as
  directed by MAJCOM. This training may be conducted in conjunction with IQT, MQT, or
  CT.
  5.10. Recurrency Training:
     5.10.1. Non-current. Currency expires at the end of the time period in which the event
     was not accomplished. Events are delinquent on the first day after the allotted time
     period, for example forty-five and 60-day requirements are non-current on the 46th and
     61st days following the last accomplished event, respectively.
         5.10.1.1. Non-currency status in any BAQ requirement prohibits unsupervised flight
         in all areas.
         5.10.1.2. Non-currency status in any BMC or MR/CMR requirement prohibits
         unsupervised flight for the specific mission.
         5.10.1.3. Crewmembers non-current in any event for up to 6 months are
         unqualified/decertified in that event. Comply with requirements of paragraph 5.11.
         for requalification and paragraph 5.12 for recertification.
     5.10.2. Recurrency Training. Aircrew members and OSFs non-current in any event for
     up to 6 months must fly under the supervision of an instructor IAW paragraph 1.6 and
     perform sufficient repetitions of each delinquent item to demonstrate proficiency in all
     non-current events. Events performed to clear delinquent requirements may be credited to
     satisfy current training requirements at the instructor’s discretion.

  5.11. Requalification Training:
     5.11.1. Requalification Training. Requalification training is required for loss of
     qualification due to loss of currency exceeding 6 months or expiration of a flight
     evaluation. Complete requalification training IAW this AFI. For loss of qualification due
     to a Q-3 evaluation, comply with AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2UH-1NV2. Requalification
     training may include proficiency advancement, tailoring the training to the individual
     based upon their experience, documented performance and formal training requirements
     as determined by the unit commander or operations officer.
     5.11.2. Use formal school courseware (if applicable). Units are not required to use
     courseware material and examinations requiring resources available only at the formal
     school or material unique to the formal school flying area. MAJCOMs may approve an
     alternate syllabus flow for in-unit requalification to compensate for the lack of
     simulators.
     5.11.2. (AFDW) Crewmembers who complete in-unit re-qualification will log
     Simulator (AC10), Crew Resource Management (AC05) and Brown-Out/White-Out
     Training (AC20) using the same date as the re-qualification training completion date.
     5.11.3. All requalification ground/flight requisites in the appropriate SOI, this AFI, and
     AFI 11-2UH-1NV2, will be completed before the requalification flight evaluation.
     Waiver authority is OG/CC.
         5.11.3.1. Instructor Requalification. Aircrew members previously instructor-qualified
         in the MDS may be directly requalified to the instructor level. The amount of time
         unqualified as an instructor determines the appropriate formal school courseware to
         use. See AFI 11-202V1, for requalification training time requirements. Regardless of
         courseware utilized, accomplish the flight evaluation(s) to the instructor level.
         5.11.3.2. Pilot, flight engineer, aerial gunner, and aerial photographer requalification.
         Aircrew members previously qualified in the MDS may be requalified to their
         previous crew position dependent upon the amount of time unqualified IAW AFI 11-
         202V1, requalification training time requirements.
     5.11.4. (Added-AFDW) For all aircrew members (except flight surgeons) to regain
     qualification, they must complete requalification training as specified below. The
     duration of "unqualified time" extends from the date the aircrew member became
     unqualified until the specific requalification training start date.
         5.11.4.1. (Added-AFDW) Unqualified up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying
         assignment, or up to 51 months at the end of an active flying assignment. Training as
         directed by the squadron commander. An AETC requalification training course
         satisfies this requirement.
         5.11.4.2. (Added-AFDW) Unqualified 39 or more months at the end of a non-flying
         assignment, or 51 or more months at the end of any active flying assignment, up to 8
         years. Complete an appropriate AETC approved requalification course.
         5.11.4.3. (Added-AFDW) Unqualified over 8 years. Complete the appropriate
         AETC initial qualification training course.
  5.12. Recertification Training:
AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012                                                       19


     5.12.1. Recertification Training. Recertification training is required in each of the
     following situations:
     5.12.1. (AFDW) 4 (Added) When a crewmember is non-current for over 6 months in
     contingency events.
         5.12.1.1. When a crewmember loses a qualification associated with a certification as
         defined in Table 1 through Table 8
         5.12.1.2. When a flight surgeon or medical technician is non-current for more than 6
         months in FS/MT flying currency events.
         5.12.1.3. When a crewmember is non-current for more than 6 months in fast rope,
         rope ladder, rappel, cargo sling, fire bucket, day water, defensive suppressive fire, or
         hot refueling continuation training events.
         5.12.1.4. (Added-AFDW) When a crewmember is non-current for over 6 months in
         contingency events.
     5.12.2. For loss of certification due to a failed flight evaluation, the unit commander has
     authority to immediately recertify the individual after the flight evaluation is successfully
     completed. For all other situations, regain certification by completing the MAJCOM
     approved courseware for that certification. All certification ground/flight requisites in the
     appropriate SOI, this AFI, and AFI 11-2UH-1NV2, will be completed before the
     recertification. Waiver authority is OG/CC.
     5.12.3. (Added-AFDW) For all aircrew members (except flight surgeons) to regain
     certification, they must complete recertification training as specified below. The duration
     of ―unqualified time‖ extends from the date the aircrew member became non-current until
     the specific recertification training start date.
         5.12.3.1. (Added-AFDW) Non-Current up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying
         assignment, or up to 51 months at the end of an active flying assignment. Training as
         directed by the squadron commander. An OG recertification training course satisfies
         this requirement.
         5.12.3.2. (Added-AFDW) Non-Current 39 or more months at the end of a non-
         flying assignment, or 51 or more months at the end of any active flying assignment,
         up to 8 years. Complete an appropriate OG approved recertification course.
         5.12.3.3. (Added-AFDW) Non-Current in the event over 8 years. Complete the
         appropriate certification training course.
  5.13. Prorated Training Requirements. Units may reduce volume requirements for
  aircrew members who are not available for flying duties in their primary aircraft for more
  than 15 days in a training period (PCS, non-flying TDY, Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF),
  medical/emergency leave, etc.). Use Table 18 to calculate the number of quarterly and
  semiannual sortie/event requirements. Do not prorate training requirements to less than one
  event. Proration will be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability,
  not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
 20                                     AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012


      5.13.1. Units will ensure aircrew members who enter continuation training after the start
      of a training period accomplish a prorated share of required events based on the number
      of full calendar months in the training period.
   5.14. Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS). All applicable ground and flight
   standard event-training identifiers found in 11-series instructions will be used in ARMS for
   all aircrew members and OSFs. MAJCOMs must approve all unit-generated X __ identifiers.
   X __ identifiers are used to specify additional training requirements for all aircrew members
   and OSFs based on local requirements. Use the following identifiers based on unit level:
   XM__ MAJCOM level identifier, XN__NAF level identifier, XS__ Squadron level
   identifier, or XF__ Flight level identifier.
6. Upgrade Training:
   6.1. General. This section outlines the requirements for aircraft commander certification
   and upgrade to any aircrew instructor position. MAJCOMs may delegate the waiver authority
   for flying hour requirements for upgrades to the OG/CC. In-unit upgrades require
   MAJCOM/A3 waiver IAW paragraph 1.12. A waiver is not required if a formal school quota
   is not available (inform MAJCOM/A3 prior to initiating in-unit upgrades). When formal
   school quotas are not available, use formal school courseware for upgrade training (if formal
   school courseware is not available use NAF-approved courseware). Upgrades are normally
   conducted after a crewmember achieves MR status.
   6.1.(AFDW)General. Waiver authority for flying hour requirements for upgrades is
   delegated to the OG/CC.
   6.2. Aircraft Commander Certification. The purpose of this certification is to assess the
   pilot’s ability perform pilot-in-command duties and responsibilities and be assigned the pilot-
   in-command code on the flight authorization as outlined in AFI 11-401. Unit commanders
   will select only highly qualified, motivated and responsible pilots for this program. A
   minimum of 200 MDS-specific primary flying hours (and a minimum of 300 MDS-specific
   flying hours total) as a mission pilot is required prior to being authorized to act as an aircraft
   commander. If a pilot has more than 700 hours total time, a minimum of 50 MDS-specific
   primary flying hours as a mission pilot is required prior to being authorized to act as an
   aircraft commander. After completing initial qualification training, inter-service transfer
   pilots may be certified as an aircraft commander. Flying time does not include UPT-H and
   UPT student time or simulator time.
   6.3. Instructor Upgrade. Units will select instructors from experienced aircrew members
   who are thoroughly qualified and skilled in the duties of their respective crew positions. All
   candidates must meet the ETCA and MAJCOM (if applicable) listed pre-requisites. These
   pre-requisites may differ for first time instructors. Unit commanders will review each
   instructor candidate's qualifications for the following minimum prerequisites:
   6.3. (AFDW ) Instructor Upgrade. The Flight Instructor Preparatory Course is not required
   if the individual has been previously instructor qualified in any MDS.
      6.3.1. Instructional Ability. All initial instructor upgrade candidates will complete
      training on the principles of instruction during the appropriate formal school upgrade
      course.
AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012                                                      21


      6.3.2. Judgment. The individual must possess judgment necessary to meet unexpected or
      induced emergencies and the ability to exercise sound judgment through mature
      realization of their own, their student's, and the aircraft's limitations.
      6.3.3. Personal Qualities. The individual must have patience, tact, understanding, and a
      desire to instruct others. Instructors must have a personality that inspires and wins the
      respect of each student.
      6.3.4. Technical Knowledge. The individual must be thoroughly familiar with aircraft
      systems and equipment, normal and emergency operating procedures, prohibited
      maneuvers, aircraft performance, and regulatory guidance.
      6.3.5. Flying Experience. Initial UH-1N instructor pilots require 100 hours
      primary/secondary time in the UH-1N aircraft after certification to aircraft commander,
      of which 50 hours must be primary. Other initial UH-1N instructor aircrew members
      require a minimum of 1 year flight experience in H-1 helicopters or 300 hours total
      helicopter time. First time Flight Engineer (FE) instructors must attend the formal school
      course. To possess the desired standards of knowledge, judgment, and proficiency the
      individual must possess a reasonable background of flying experience. Normally, these
      qualities progress together, however flying hours alone cannot be accepted as criteria for
      any one or all qualities.

Remote Notes:
1. NVG events may satisfy night unaided requirements: i.e. NVG Remote Ops (S620)
accomplishes Night (Unaided) Remote Ops (T120).
2. Aircrew members who are non-current/unqualified for NVG events remain mission qualified,
but cannot perform the specified event(s) until current/qualified.
3. Sortie/event accomplishments at night may be credited toward similar day requirements.
4. NVG qualified pilots will only log NVG sorties while at a set of controls.
5. Units will not practice unaided night search patterns. A night sortie consists of a basic sortie
and requires 1 hour of night time of which ½ hour must be primary.
6. An NVG sortie consists of a basic sortie and requires 1 hour of NVG time of which ½ hour
must be primary.

Formation Sortie Notes:
1. Each pilot must fly each required sub-event as both lead and wing to log a formation sortie.
2. NVG events may satisfy day requirements: i.e. NVG Formation Sortie (T141) accomplishes
Formation Sortie (T140).
3. Aircrew members who are non-current/unqualified for NVG events remain mission qualified,
but cannot perform the specified event(s) until current/qualified.
4. An NVG sortie consists of a basic sortie and requires 1 hour of NVG time of which ½ hour
must be primary.

NVG Sortie Notes:
1. NVG events may satisfy night unaided requirements: i.e. NVG sortie (S610) accomplishes
Night (Unaided) Sortie (B410).
2. Sortie/event accomplishments at night may be credited toward similar day requirements.
3. NVG qualified pilots will only log NVG sorties while at a set of controls.
4. An NVG sortie consists of a basic sortie and requires 1 hour of NVG time of which ½ hour
must be primary.
5. Aircrew members who are non-current/unqualified for NVG events remain mission qualified,
but cannot perform the specified event(s) until current/qualified. Non-current NVG
crewmembers are required to maintain unaided currency (i.e. B410).

Terms
Academic Training— A course of instruction that includes but is not limited to classroom
instruction related to aircraft systems and operation, flight characteristics and techniques,
performance, normal procedures, abnormal and emergency procedures. Academic courses are
designed to prepare to students for simulator/flight training and normally completed prior to
commencing that training.
Actual Airdrop— Aerial delivery of personnel, supplies, or equipment from an aircraft inflight.
Aircraft Commander (AC)— A pilot who has been certified to perform duties in command.
Aircrew Training Device (ATD)— Hands on training aids that include cockpit procedure
trainers (CPT), part task trainers (PTT), weapons systems trainers (WST), operational flight
trainers (OFT), or simulators.
Aircrew Training System (ATS)— An integrated qualification, upgrade, and continuation
training program for aircrew. Civilian contractors conduct most academic and ATD training: Air
Force conducts all flight training.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)— Aircraft above primary mission inventory to permit
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, modifications, inspections and repair without reduction
of aircraft available for operational missions.
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)— A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The
member must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and
flight standards set for the weapons system. BAQ will only be carried by aircrew until the
completion of MQT. BAQ is not a permanent qualification except for General Officers above the
wing level, and any other crewmembers specifically authorized by MAJCOM DO.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)— The status of an aircrew who has satisfactorily completed
training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions but
does not maintain CMR status. Aircrew accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in
all, and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions of their weapon system
and unit. These aircrew members may also maintain special capabilities.
Certification— The process of certifying aircrew tactical employment and special weapons
capabilities, procedures, and rules.
AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012                                                        59


Combat Mission Ready (CMR)— The status of an aircrew who has satisfactorily completed
training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions,
and maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions. All active duty API-1/2’s,
Squadron Commander, Operations Officers, and OG/CC designated API-6 manning positions are
required to maintain this qualification level. Exception: If a unit is over-manned, they may elect
to train the front line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated as BMC. At least 50%
of the aircrew selected for CMR must be inexperienced, if available.
Continuation Training (CT)— Training to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew
capabilities to perform unit missions and aircrew proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus
missions, tests, or evaluations. Applicable to CMR and BMC aircrew members.
Crew Resource Management (CRM)— Training concept that emphasizes team effectiveness
by enhancing individual and aircrew performance in communication, situational awareness,
effective leadership and management, and crew coordination. (IAW AFI 11-290).
Currency— The minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely.
Direct Supervision— An aircrew member is considered under direct supervision when flying
with an instructor in the same crew position. For pilots the IP must occupy one of the pilot seats
and for other aircrew the instructor must be readily available to assume the primary duties if
required.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)— An evaluation of aircrew knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and non-critical EPs conducted by an evaluator. A simulator, weapon
system trainer, or aircrew training device may be used to administer an EPE. If none of these
aids are available, administer the EPE verbally.

100 hours of primary time in their MDS after aircraft commander certification. After completion
of IQT, pilots must achieve 200 hours in their current primary aircraft or 100 hours in current
primary aircraft if previously qualified in another helicopter, to be considered experienced. After
completion of IQT, flight engineers must achieve 200 hours in their current primary aircraft
or100 hours in current primary aircraft if previously qualified in another helicopter, to be
considered experienced. NVG qualified aircrews require > 100 hours total NVG hours to be
considered NVG experienced. Aircraft commanders are considered NVG experienced after
accumulating 100 total NVG hours, of which 20 hours are as an Aircraft Commander (primary or
secondary time) after NVG aircraft commander certification.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)— A flight or flights performed to determine whether an
aircraft and or its various components are functioning according to predetermined specifications
while subjected to the flight environment. FCFs are conducted when it is not feasible to
determine safe or required operation (aerodynamic reaction, air loading, signal propagation etc.)
by means of ground or shop tests. Conditions requiring FCFs are specified in the –6 technical
order for each type of aircraft. FCF checks or maneuvers can only be accomplished by current
and qualified crewmembers.

mission support forces in order to attain specified mission objectives during operations and
exercises. The MC is the designating commander's representative and is responsible for taking
care of the details and the people involved in the mission.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)— Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in the unit’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR or
BMC status.
Night Sortie— For helicopters, to credit a night sortie or NVG sortie, aircrew must log a
minimum of 1 hour of night time, and for pilots ½ hour must be primary.
Night Time— Night time is defined as that portion of flight time between the end of evening
civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air
Almanac.
Operational Mission— Any mission not designated as a unilateral training mission.
Operational Support Flyer (OSF)— An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not
require flying; however, the Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an infrequent or
irregular basis in order to perform a specific, essential in-flight duty which a regularly assigned
primary or mission crewmember cannot perform. Helicopter OSFs normally include, but are not
limited to, medical technician and security force personnel.
Primary Aircraft Assigned (PAA)— Aircraft authorized for performance of the operational
mission. The PAA forms the basis for allocation of operating resources to include manpower,
support equipment, and flying-hour funds. The operating command determines the PAA required
to meet their assigned missions (See AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
Distribution, Accounting, and Termination). Includes PMAA and PTAA.

     make an entry for anything that interrupts training for 10 duty days or more and an
     explanation as to why the training was stopped (i.e. DNIF, emergency leave, TDY). Enter
     the dates on which the training was stopped and restarted. Other remarks may be made as
     appropriate.
         A2.1.6.1.1. Any change to the training sequence requires a waiver by the OG/CC (or
         as directed by MAJCOM guidance). Accomplish a SOTW to document waiver
         approval. A SOTW is defined as any change in the sequence of scheduled training to
         better match unit scheduling, maintenance, operational and weather needs. An SOTW
         does not allow training after the flight evaluation. Training altered by the SOTW will
         be accomplished prior to the evaluation for that phase. SOTWs will be annotated on
         the AETC Form 73 and will include as a minimum: affected training,
         rationale/justification for changing the training sequence, and a consideration of the
         effects on RPLs due to out of sequence training as a result of the change.
         A2.1.6.1.2. Notify MAJCOM through NAF of all upgrades that are placed on ―Hold‖
         or ―Termination‖. Possible reasons for placing an individual on ―Hold‖ might be due
         to DNIFs, TDYs, personal problems, etc. while a cause for ―Termination‖ would be
         due to medical disqualification, or flying/academic deficiencies as per Figure A2.1.,
         Commander’s Review Process.
         A2.1.6.1.3. Upon completion of all certifications and upgrades, a final DOT review
         will be accomplished ensuring all of the training has been completed. This entry also
         serves to close out the training folder.
     A2.1.6.2. Instructors or flight examiners will make comments for all certification,
     training, and evaluation flights. The following are considered major topic areas of the
     narrative description and will be annotated for every entry on the AETC Form 73. The
     student’s rank, last name, type of aircraft, and crew position will be hand-written/typed
     on the AETC Form 73. All other entries will be hand written.

          scenario/profile to accurately document each event; i.e. TAC, NVG, type/number of
          approaches, sites/LZs flown to, etc. Comments in this section should include an entry
          pertaining to general weather conditions (i.e. sky condition, visibility, winds, temp)
          and other pertinent weather information. Comments should also elaborate on student
          strengths and weaknesses, identify problem areas, record unusual circumstances and
          indicate student progress. Ensure weaknesses, applicable restrictions, and additional
          training required to clear the weaknesses/restrictions are clearly annotated and
          explained. Generalized comments, such as ―Student made several minor errors on
          preflight that were corrected by the instructor,‖ are not acceptable. Specific errors
          must be documented. A comment will be entered whenever the achieved performance
          level is below the printed RPL. Enter the authorization of progression on proficiency
          advancements. For evaluations completed Q-1 enter ―Profile: See AF Form 8 for

         evaluation. The operations officer or his designated representative will review the
         applicable phase of training to ensure that all flight and ground training requisites
         have been accomplished to the appropriate RPL. The reviewer initials in the
         "Operations Review" block of the AETC Form 75 to denote completion. The
         reviewer will also make an entry of "OPS Review" in the "SORTIE ID" block of the
         AETC Form 73 with accompanying comments in the profile/strengths/weaknesses/
         recommendations block. The "Ops Review" entry will only be used for flight
         evaluation recommendation entries.
  A2.1.7. AETC Form 74, Aircrew Training Sortie Maneuver Grades. This form provides
  training profiles, task listings, scheduled training, and RPLs for each ground/flight-training
  task IAW the respective SOI. This form reflects RPLs required for training sortie completion
  and is also used to document the student’s demonstrated task/sub-task performance and
  knowledge levels. An end of task RPL is annotated on the right side. This RPL must be
  maintained prior to the respective flight evaluation. Maintain AETC Form 74 with the
  applicable training syllabus it was designed for in Section 4 of the training folder.
     A2.1.7.1. Trainee Name. Enter the student’s rank and last name.

     A2.1.7.7. Date (DD / MMM). Annotate day and month (i.e. 06 Mar, 29 Sep, etc.) training
     was accomplished.
     A2.1.7.8. Grade. Instructors or evaluators will compute an overall grade for each ride
     (instructional or evaluation). Flight evaluation results will be annotated as Q-1, Q-2, or
     Q-3. Reference paragraphs A2.1.9.3 through A2.1.9.3.8 for a description and an
     explanation of the various instructional grades authorized for use.
         A2.1.7.8.1. Deleted.
     A2.1.7.9. Task/Topic Listing. Used to indicate the (P) performance or (K) knowledge
     level of the maneuver item tasks or sub-tasks that must be attained by the student on that
     particular flight. Use the left column to identify a general area (i.e., Flight Preparation,
     Normal Operations, Emergency Procedures, etc.). The formal school or MAJCOM will
     develop these listings from the appropriate task/objective documents and master task
     listings.
     A2.1.7.10. Minimum Events. This column reflects the minimum number of times a
     student must perform, or be exposed to an event/task on any given mission, series of
     missions, or phase of training (i.e. UH1N-MP-UQ MIF item # 136, AIE Procedures 2).
     These events cannot be proficiency advanced and are minimum requirements.
     A2.1.7.11. Performance and Knowledge Grades. For AETC Form 74s with preprinted
     RPL grades, make a diagonal (/) slash through the grade if the student meets the RPL. If a
     higher or lower RPL grade is met, write the new grade over the preprinted one. If the job
     element contains an RPL of "R" (review) and the student satisfactorily completes the
     reviewed item, then slash (/) through the "R". An RPL of "I" indicates a requirement for
     introduction of the maneuver. An instructor will demonstrate the task and place an "I" for
     introduction in the block. If the AETC Form 74 doesn’t have preprinted RPL grades, the
     instructor will indicate the grade attained by the student on each accomplished job
     element by writing the grade in the appropriate column and row.
         A2.1.7.11.1. For certain in-unit upgrades not all aspects of the SOI will be used. If
         this situation arises, line through the unused portions (P/K RPL columns) of the
         AETC Form 74 when these events are not required for the upgrade [i.e. AC mission
         requal upgrade (contact portion not applicable), (hoist operations not applicable),
         etc.]. Units are not authorized to change RPLs. RPLs on the AETC Form 74 can be

       line, but will be entered on two separate lines with the training times divided
       appropriately.
A2.1.9.2.1. Extra (X) Sorties. Flying performed without accomplishing job elements, for
example, an upgrading pilot returns from a TDY, DNIF, or leave etc. and the unit CC or DO
recommends an extra (X) sortie to regain proficiency (i.e. DT-2/X-1, C-1/X-1). X-sorties are not
to be used to complete deficient items or to avoid an unsatisfactory grade after receiving a "T"
grade on a previous sortie. Enter "X" in the "Grade" column of AETC Form 75 for all X-sorties
that are ungraded.
           A2.1.9.2.2. Remedial (R) Sorties. Remedial training required to improve a student's
           performance following an Unsatisfactory (U) grade, to include ground training, flight
           training, or flight evaluations. If two flights are prescribed, the first remedial training
           flight will not be graded, but an entry is required on AETC Form 73. If both remedial
           training flights are utilized, enter "X" in the training folder on the AETC Form 75 for
           the first flight and continue with the second remedial flight. An overall grade will be
           assigned for the second flight on the AETC Form 75. As a minimum, all
           unsatisfactory job elements must be graded satisfactorily to complete the remedial
           sortie .
       A2.1.9.3. Grade. Instructors or evaluators will compute an overall grade for each ride
       (instructional or evaluation). Flight evaluation results will be annotated as Q-1, Q-2, or
       Q-3.
           A2.1.9.3.1. Satisfactory (S). If the student’s achieved performance/knowledge level
           meets or exceeds the listed RPL, for all tasks, the overall grade will be satisfactory
           (S). The student advances to the next programmed lesson or training period.
           A2.1.9.3.2. Training Required (T). If the student falls below the listed RPL for one or
           more job elements, the overall grade will be training required (T). If the job element
           was not graded below standards the last time it was graded and additional training
           periods remain in this phase of training that include this job element, then the student
           advances to the next programmed lesson or training period. If there are no additional
           training periods remaining that include this job element, then the grade will be
           unsatisfactory (U).
           A2.1.9.3.3. Unsatisfactory (U). If the student falls below the listed RPL on the same
           job element/ task for two consecutive training periods, or falls below the listed RPL
           on any job element and no training periods remain prior to an evaluation, or if
           dangerous tendencies are noted, the overall grade will be unsatisfactory (U). The
           student requires a progress review from the unit commander or operations officer
           before scheduling any additional training. Refer to Section A2D for progress review
           guidance.
NOTES:
Instructors will notify the unit commander or operations officer of all ―T‖ and ―U‖ grades.
Instructors will annotate notification of the commander/operations officer in their comments on
AETC Form 73. The unit commander or operations officer will review all T and U grades
carefully and identify students who need special assistance or additional training. The unit
commander or operations officer will determine whether a student receiving an unsatisfactory
AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012                                                          71


grade will be scheduled for additional academic training before another instructional ride. The
unit commander or operations officer will annotate their actions with an entry on the AETC
Form 73.
           A2.1.9.3.4. Incomplete (I). The overall grade will be an incomplete (I) if any of the
           following conditions are met: (1) The student is not graded on all lesson job elements.
           (2) The student has not previously attained the RPL of the missed job element(s) and
           the RPL changes to a higher level on the next training period. (3) The student was
           graded ―I‖ on the previous training period and the missed job element(s) could not be
           accomplished during the current training period.
           A2.1.9.3.5. If the incomplete sortie is a prerequisite for the subsequent flight period,
           the incomplete job element(s) must be completed prior to starting the subsequent
           flight period. To clear an incomplete sortie, the missing job elements will be made up
           on subsequent flight periods, if possible; otherwise, the lesson will be reflown
           covering the item(s) not previously graded. The training period remains incomplete
           until accomplishment of the job element(s) on a subsequent flight period.
NOTES:
The sortie may be graded complete if the RPL was previously achieved or if the RPL can be
achieved on a subsequent sortie where the RPL has not increased. The missed job element must
be accomplished prior to its RPL increase. If ―I‖ is used, it will be followed by the reason: ―I-
MX‖ for a maintenance abort or delay, ―I-OPS‖ for an operations abort or delay, ―I-SYM‖ for a
sympathetic abort or delay, ―I-WX‖ for weather abort or delay, ―I-IN‖ for student requirements
being incompatible with the sortie being flown, or ―I-OTH‖ for other reasons that the instructor
will explain in his comments. All incomplete entries will be fully explained on the AETC Form
73.
           A2.1.9.3.6. Proficiency Advancement (P). Students may be advanced on a
           proficiency basis if the end of phase RPL is attained early in that phase, upon
           recommendation of the instructor, and with the concurrence of the unit commander or
           operations officer. The student advances to a later programmed lesson or training
           period at the discretion of the CC/DO. Document proficiency advancement as
           follows:
               A2.1.9.3.6.1. Instructor makes recommendation on the AETC Form 73.

Section A2B—GRADING STANDARDS AND CODES
A2.2. Course Training Standards. This section explains course grading standards and training
codes. Course training standards describe the minimum overall performance levels required to
progress and graduate from a course. Each syllabus lists the course training standards and RPLs
that students must achieve for each sortie before progressing to subsequent training.
   A2.2.1. Grading Criteria. Instructors will determine both individual mission element
   grades and the overall mission grade by assessing the student’s performance against the
   RPLs.
   A2.2.2. Task Performance.
   A2.2.3. Task Knowledge. Section A2C—GENERAL REMEDIAL PROCEDURES
A2.3. This section outlines progress review and remedial training procedures.
   A2.3.1. Instructor Requirements. When a crewmember/OSF in training receives a "U"
   grade on any ground/flight training, receives a Q-3 on a flight evaluation, fails a required
   examination, or fails to satisfactorily clear a Q-2 flight evaluation, they will receive a
   Progress Review. The instructor or flight examiner will document the deficiency on the
   AETC Form 73 using the Profile/Strengths/Weaknesses/Recommendations format. The
   instructor or flight examiner will recommend that the student receives remedial training
   sessions/flights as needed to improve deficient areas IAW the Commander’s Review Process,
   Figure A2.1 and also recommends that the student is entered into "Marginal Status." The
   instructor or flight examiner will immediately notify the unit commander and/or operations
   officer of their recommendation s.
   A2.3.2. Progress Review. The unit operations officer will conduct the Progress Review. A
   Progress Review is a detailed assessment of an aircrew member/OSF’s training progress. It is
   used to determine the effectiveness of training and the individual’s ability and desire to attain
   the RPLs prior to being entered into "Marginal Training Status" or a second-level progress
   review. The operations officer will meet with the student and instructor to review the
   student’s progress. The operations officer will brief the student on their status using Figure
   A2.1 The operations officer will counsel the individual and document counseling on AETC
   Form 73. The operations officer will annotate the following remarks: Profile: Incomplete.
   Marginal Training Status, followed by appropriate comments and recommendations or
   concurrence/non-concurrence         with    instructor’s    recommendations        using      the
   profile/strengths/weaknesses/recommendations format. The entry will include a statement of
   failure (include relevant conditions), associated problems, and additional training
   recommendations. "Progress Review" will be annotated in the "SORTIE ID" block of the
   AETC Form 73. The operations officer will advise the unit commander of his/her
   recommendations. For individuals attached to the flying unit, the operations officer will
   inform the student’s supervisor of the student’s placement on marginal training status. The
   operations officer will direct all follow-on actions and document them on the AETC Form
   73.
 74                                      AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012


       A2.3.2.1. Unit commanders or operations officers may document formal counseling of
       students for other than academic or flying deficiency on AF Form 174, Record of
       Individual Counseling. The counselor should maintain a copy of the completed AF Form
       174. A copy will also be given to the individual and the unit commander.
A2.3.3. Remedial Training. This is additional training given after a student fails a
measurement or does not attain an RPL. The instructor recommends type and amount of training
IAW Figure A2.1 The unit commander or operations officer, as appropriate, must approve
recommendations. This remedial training will be completed and the student removed from
―Marginal Training Status‖ prior to changing phases or proceeding in the course. If the student is
placed in ―Marginal Training Status‖ due to failure of an evaluation flight, he/she will not be
removed from ―Marginal Training Status‖ until the evaluation flight is completed in a
satisfactory manner. The unit commander or operations officer will remove the student from
―Marginal Training Status‖. The unit commander or operations officer will make an entry on the
AETC Form 73 indicating that the individual has been removed from ―Marginal Training Status‖
along with further recommended actions (if applicable).
A2.3.3.1. Academic. Additional training required to help the student attain an RPL will be
documented on the AETC Form 73 to include the amount of time involved. The operations
officer will determine maximum remedial academic training. If the student fails to meet the
required RPL after receiving and completing remedial training, a Second Level Progress Review
will be conducted.
A2.3.3.2. Flying. Remedial training required to improve a student's performance following an
Unsatisfactory (U) grade, to include ground training, will be documented on the AETC Form 73.
Academic training will be accomplished prior to remedial training flights. The following
procedures apply to remedial training flights:
A2.3.3.2.1. The unit commander or operations officer will coordinate with the unit scheduler
and unit instructors to give the student the highest priority possible commensurate with other unit
mission requirements.
A2.3.3.2.2. Unit commanders may authorize up to a maximum of two remedial training flights
for any specific student deficiency.
A2.3.3.2.3. Remedial training flights will satisfy the original training requirement if the student's
performance is satisfactory. All remedial training flights will be annotated (AI-3/R-1, AI-3/R-2,
NC-4/R-1, NC-4/R-2, etc.) at the top of the first unnumbered column on the AETC Form 74
along with the appropriate flight time and RPLs. If two flights are prescribed, the first remedial
training flight will not be graded and an entry is required on the AETC Form 73. Enter the date
of the remedial training flight, the remedial training flight designation, and the grade of "X",
instructor’s name, training time, and mission time on the AETC Form 75 and continue with the
second remedial flight. The second remedial flight is graded using the following procedures: All
documentation is the same as the first remedial training flight except that an actual grade of E, S,
I, or U will be entered on the AETC Form 75. All maneuvers accomplished on a remedial
training flight will be graded on the AETC Form 74 with an appropriate RPL .
A2.3.3.2.4. Consider using the same instructor for both remedial training flights.
A2.3.4. Second-Level Progress Review (SLPR). A Second-Level Progress Review (Section
A2D) is a detailed assessment by the unit commander of a student's training progress to ensure
that training provided has been effective and that the student has the desire and ability to attain
the RPLs. A second-level progress review may result in the recommendation for Aircrew
Evaluation Board (AEB) action for CEAs or a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) for officers.
AFI11-2UH-1NV1_AFDWSUP_I 31 OCTOBER 2012                                                        75


Document results or actions of SLPR on the AETC Form 73. "Second Level Progress Review"
will be annotated in the "SORTIE ID" block of the AETC Form 73.
A2.3.5. Student Disenrollment or Elimination. Student disenrollment or elimination from a
flying course will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service,
Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, and this instruction. The unit commander is responsible for
ensuring that all training, evaluation, and counseling records have been properly prepared. The
unit commander is responsible for disenrollment or elimination proceedings. Notify the
appropriate MAJCOM through the appropriate numbered Air Force prior to any student being
disenrolled or eliminated.
A2.3.5.1. Rated officers recommended for elimination by a Second-Level Progress Review for a
training deficiency will be called before an FEB IAW AFI 11-402 and this instruction.

                                 AFDW SYLLABUS GUIDE

A3.1. (AFDW) A syllabus is an approved directive for executing training courses. Syllabuses
are directive and must be followed precisely, unless a waiver request is approved. Prerequisite
waiver, waiver approval authority, and deviation instructions are defined in each syllabus. If a
conflict with an AFI 11-2MDS-specific publication is discovered, the AFI 11-2MDS-specific
publication takes precedence. Notify the syllabus OPR of the conflict.
A3.2. (AFDW) A syllabus prescribes the overall program of instruction for a course, gives
special instructions, and lists the title and duration of training events in the curriculum. The
syllabus POC is the focal point for all suggestions and develops draft revisions and page-insert
changes to coordinate when necessary. A syllabus or training review is not mandatory but
should be scheduled if necessary, or if it can’t be accomplished electronically.
A3.3. (AFDW) Graduates must meet each syllabus-directed course training standard (CTS) at
the required proficiency level. CTSs prescribe the performance, conditions, and standards
required of flying training course graduates. Use evaluation criteria from AFI 11-2UH-1N,
Volumes 2 as a default standard if not otherwise specifically defined in the syllabus.
A3.4. (AFDW) All course syllabuses must contain the following items:
   A3.4.1. (AFDW) Well-defined phases, categories, and units to accurately determine
   triggers for progress review.
   A3.4.2. (AFDW) Criteria to define incomplete training sorties.
   A3.4.3. (AFDW) Complete training outline to meet the standards of proficiency specified in
   the CTSs.
   A3.4.4. (AFDW) Academic subjects and lessons required during the course.
   A3.4.5. (AFDW) All ground, simulator and aircraft training required.
A3.5. (AFDW) An example syllabus is available as a template from the AFDW Helicopter
Operations SharePoint site at https://afdw.afncr.af.mil/org/AFDW_A3_5/A3OV/default.aspx.
Units will use the template to create a new syllabus or copy the styles into an existing document
to ensure standard formatting.
