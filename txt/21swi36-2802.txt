                        21ST SPACE WING AWARDS PROGRAM

1.1. All personnel assigned to 21st Space Wing (SW) units, to include local nationals, who meet
the eligibility requirements may compete for the quarterly and annual awards program. All
nominations forwarded to the 21 SW will be in accordance with (IAW) this instruction. The
Awards Program is designed to recognize the superior performance and outstanding achievement
of personnel. Nominees are representative of a quality force and therefore must be able to stand
the test of “whole person/whole life/whole career” scrutiny. Award recipients selected in 21 SW
programs are eligible for higher headquarters awards programs as applicable.
1.2. Eligibility.
   1.2.1. All members assigned to 21 SW units are eligible for wing quarterly and/or annual
   awards. Nominees must be submitted by their respective Group.
   1.2.2. Military members who are subject to nonjudicial punishment, or who have an
   unfavorable information file, control roster action, referral EPR, applied for the
   commissioning program, or similar actions during the award period are not eligible for
   nomination. Personnel are not eligible for consideration if they fail to pass the fitness
   assessment.        Members        can        reference     http://www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/
   affitnessprogram/index.asp for the fitness requirements. The Fitness AFI is currently under
   revision and will become effective January 1, 2010.
   1.2.3. Civilian nominees cannot have had disciplinary action taken during any portion of the
   nomination period.
   1.2.4. Military members must be at home station for 75% of the award period to be eligible
   for nomination. This includes, but not limited to, individuals that have deployed/or TDY for
   up to six months. Units must provide documentation showing when member departed for
   deployment/or TDY. Members who are deployed and/or TDY for six months are eligible for
   the Annual Awards Program. Personnel deployed for 365 days are not eligible. If a member
   is on man days and serving in an active status they may compete for either the annual or
   quarterly awards.
   1.2.5. Civilians must be assigned to the nominating unit for the entire award period for
   quarterly awards and at least six months of the award period for annual awards. Exception:
   Civilians assigned to a short tour area for at least three months are eligible for annual award
   consideration.
   1.2.6. Members will be nominated for the grade or pay band category in which they served
   during the majority of the period. For example, if a member was a Senior Airman for two
   months and then promoted to Staff Sergeant, the member will compete in the Airman of the
   Quarter category. A member promoted at the mid-point of the award cycle will normally be
   nominated in the higher category but may be nominated in either category at the supervisor's
   discretion. If a civilian was in Pay Band One for two months and then promoted to Pay Band
   Two, the member will compete in Pay Band One.

    1.2.7. Captains selected or promoted to the rank of Major and SMSgts selected or promoted
    to the rank of CMSgt during any award period are ineligible for consideration. (Exception:
    If a member has already been selected as the Wing nominee before the promotion release).
    1.2.8. First Sergeant nominees must serve in the First Sergeant AFSC and have held the
    8F000 Special Duty Identifier (SDI) for a minimum of 6 months during the award period in
    order to be eligible for nomination. (AFI 36-2805, para 3.3.1)
    1.2.9. Individuals who won any category the previous quarter are ineligible for submission
    the next quarter, i.e. if an individual won for the first quarter of 2008, they are not eligible for
    further quarterly award competitions until the third quarter of 2008. This does not apply to
    wing-level annual awards.
    1.2.10. Annual Award nominees do not have to be quarterly award winners. Annual award
    winners will automatically be representing the 21 SW as a nominee for the Twelve
    Outstanding Airman of the Year Award (12 OAY) and Team Pete Annual Awards. In

    1.6.4. Scoring Procedures.
       1.6.4.1. 21 SW/CCA prepares award packages and score sheets for board president and
       members in every category (Atch 3 and 4). Each board member will receive the award
       packages via e-mail no later than 2 days prior to the board meeting.
       1.6.4.2. Board members will evaluate and score each nomination package.
       1.6.4.3. Members must be fair and impartial. Set aside any bias (positive or negative)
       and evaluate the packages based on the substance of the write-ups (AF IMT 1206).
       Quality and impact of the accomplishments are important, not the quantity. However,
       please keep in mind it is not the "importance" of one's job you're rating, but what the
       individual did within their job.
       1.6.4.4. Scoring category guidelines.
           1.6.4.4.1. Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty. The member's
           leadership and job performance in their primary duty, including the development of
           new techniques, must have significantly contributed to increase mission effectiveness
           during the quarter/year. You should be looking for individual accomplishments--not
           unit accomplishments.
21SWI36-2802 1 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   9


          1.6.4.4.2. Significant Self-Improvement. The member must have shown this
          improvement through off-duty education, achievements in professional or cultural
          societies or associations, development of creative abilities, et ceteria, during the
          award period. This includes military and civilian classes, professional development,
          self-development, et ceteria. In general, self-improvement that is voluntary carries
          more weight than just attending a mandatory class.
          1.6.4.4.3. Base or Community Involvement. The member must have contributed to
          the military or civilian community's welfare, morale or status during the reporting
          period. This includes base/squadron/community involvement such as Top-3, booster
          club, coach of a youth athletic team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a member
          of an organization is not as strong as being in a leadership position (president,
          secretary, coach, etc.).
      1.6.4.5. Compare the accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly. Pay
      careful attention to the category criteria. Filler and fluff do not count for anything. Do
      not score each category independently. Using the whole-person concept, grade the
      packages on a scale of 6-10 point systems, using half point increments, you must
      differentiate between nominees. (Table 1.1.)
      1.6.4.6. Rank the packages 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. Do not submit a tie to the board president.
      In the event of equal scores, review packages and decide which to rate higher.
      Remember this is a "whole person" program and you are selecting the individual who you
      think will best represent the wing.
      1.6.4.7. Rankings of board members will be added and the package with the highest
      overall ranking (lowest total number) will be the winner for that category. All significant
      differences as determined by the board during discussion.

section of career fields. There are three categories of competition: AMN, NCO and SNCO. All
guidance and verbiage are from Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).

   Force Space Command.

   based upon achievements that occurred only during the calendar year.
   3.2.3. Nominees are representatives of the Air Force Enlisted Force, they must also stand the
   test of a "whole life/whole career" scrutiny. The "whole life/whole career" screening will be

   majority of the award period. For example, if a member has held the grade of TSgt for seven
   months of the award period and is then promoted to MSgt, nominate the member in the NCO
   category, not the SNCO category. If the member is promoted at the six-month point of the
   award cycle, the Command determines in which category to nominate the member.

        the accomplishments are important, not the quantity. However, please keep in mind it is

   4.5.10. Scoring Category Guidelines.
      4.5.10.1. Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty. The member's
      leadership and job performance in their primary duty, including the development of new
      techniques, must have contributed significantly to increase mission effectiveness during
      the quarter/year. You should be looking for individual accomplishments--not unit
      accomplishments.
      4.5.10.2. Other. The member must have shown improvement through off-duty
      education (military and civilian classes, professional development, self-development),
      achievement in professional, cultural societies or associations, development of creative
      abilities, et cetera during the award period. In general, self-improvement that is voluntary
      carries more weight than just attending a mandatory class. The member must have
      contributed to the military or civilian community's welfare, morale or status during the
      reporting period. This includes base/squadron/community involvement such as Top-3,
      booster club, coach of a youth athletic team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a
      member of an organization is not as strong as being in a leadership position (president,
      secretary, coach, etc.).
      4.5.10.3. Compare the accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly.
      Pay careful attention to the category criteria. Filler and fluff do not count for anything.
      Do not score each category independently. Using the whole-person concept, grade the
      packages on a scale of 6-10 point system, using half point increments, you must
      differentiate between nominees. (Table 1.1.)
4.6. Quarterly Awards.
   4.6.1. “Team Pete” quarterly award is specifically designed to recognize members from the
   Colorado Springs area. Nominations suspense date will be published to all applicable units.

     and how well the member performed assigned primary and additional duties. Define the
     scope and level of responsibilities and the impact on the mission and unit. Consider
     development of quality management principles, new techniques, and contributions to
     increased mission effectiveness, and acceptance of responsibility. In addition, consider scope
     and level of responsibility and cost saving initiatives.
     4.6.4. Other: (2 lines maximum for quarterly nominations, 4 lines maximum for annual
     nominations). The member must have shown improvement through off-duty education

     include, etc during the award period. In general, self-improvement that is voluntary carries
     more weight than just attending a mandatory class. The member must have contributed to
     the military or civilian community's welfare, morale or status during the reporting period.
     This includes base/squadron/community involvement such as Top-3, booster club, coach of a
     youth athletic team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a member of an organization is not
     as strong as being in a leadership position (president, secretary, coach, etc.). May contain
     any additional accomplishments the nominating official deems significant.
