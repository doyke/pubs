17. Responsibilities for Support of Non-tactical Radio Procedures and Communication-
Out Procedures:
   17.1. NRP is: The continuation of operations without the use of the non-tactical radios,
   whether it is for security reasons or the frequencies are being jammed. The code words for
   this procedure are “Silent ops.”
   17.2. COP is: The continuation of operations without the use of non-tactical radios, LAN
   and telephone, whether it is for security reasons or the frequencies are being jammed. The
   code words for this procedure are “Comm-out.”
   17.3. MOC will:
      17.3.1. Act as Point of Contact (POC) for implementing start action and canceling
      NRP/COP within the 56 Mx Group complex.
      17.3.2. Send one controller to each squadron to work alongside the production super and
      track all information. USAF assets will be manned first, then FMS if personal available.
      17.3.3. Send a runner to Petroleum Oil Lubricant (POL) and Fire Department to inform
      them of Comm-out conditions.

     17.3.4. Announce all call: “Attention all radio’s this net, this is the MOC, Implement
     (Comm-out/Silent Ops Procedures), I repeat Implement (Comm-out/Silent Ops
     Procedures).” Runners will be utilized in the event radio communication is not possible.
     17.3.5. At anytime if the radio’s are used for non-emergency purposes the MOC will
     interrupt the transmission and repeat the phrase “Implement (Comm-out/Silent Ops
     Procedures).”
     17.3.6. Send a runner to the AMU’s to get updates on Aircraft Status.
  17.4. 56 MOS End-of-Runway (EOR) will utilize runners in the event maintenance support
  is required at either North or South EOR.
  17.5. 56 AMXS, 756 AMXS, 56 CMS and 56 EMS will:
     17.5.1. Act as initial and subsequent contact for the implementation and cancellation of
     NRP/COP within their squadrons.
     17.5.2. Ensure all radio operators are familiar with the appropriate response to the call
     for implementation and cancellation of NRP/COP.
     17.5.3. Devise standardized notification cues and procedures (once NRP/COP has been
     implemented) on all known requirements for response in support of the launch (e.g., red-
     balls, refuel, reload, etc.). Cues and procedures will be forwarded to applicable AMU
     OPR.
     17.5.4. Provide a central location from which launch trucks will dispatch specialists.
     17.5.5. Ensure all maintenance vehicles that are required to support a NRP/COP be
     clearly marked to aid in identification from a distance.
     17.5.6. During NRP, ensure information is passed to the MOC by phone.
     17.5.7. During COP, ensure runners return to the MOC hourly with all required
     information.
     17.5.8. During NRP, tow clearance and engine run clearance will be received from the
