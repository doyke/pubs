SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates references.
1. Setting Up Bulletin Boards.
   1.1. Commanders, directors, chiefs of staff offices, and division chiefs will.
       1.1.1. Set up within their organizations the minimum number of official bulletin boards
       located where the majority of the employees will have reasonable access; such as, rest
       areas, building entrances, or strategic places which will display information to the
       greatest number of individuals.
 2                                                               HILLAFBI33-302 17 June 2010


        1.1.2. Appoint a monitor and alternate to maintain each official bulletin board within
        their organization and post their names and phone numbers in an appropriate corner of
        each board.
     1.2. A list of bulletin boards, location of each, and name of monitor and alternate will be
     kept by each organization.
     1.3. The appropriate office of responsibility in the OO-ALC Headquarters Building
     (Building 1102) and in the 75 ABW Headquarters Building (Building 180) will appoint a
     building manager to ensure an official bulletin board is maintained in both of these buildings.
     NOTE: This does not prevent other organizations in Buildings 180 and 1102 from having an
     official bulletin board.
2. Bulletin Board Monitor Responsibilities.
     2.1. Divide each bulletin board into three clearly marked sections: “Official”, “Unofficial”,
     and “Union”. According to the local supplement to the Master Labor Agreement, space
     allotted for union use will be not less than 48 inches by 36 inches, or one-third of the total
     space of the bulletin board. A union section is not required in organizations that have no
     civilian employees.
     2.2. Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) activities will provide the union with bulletin board
     space for union posting at each activity level where official bulletin boards are provided. If
     there is more than one activity level in a building only one board may be needed.
     2.3. Monitors will ensure that documents listed in Attachment 2, paragraph A2.1., are posted
     and will comply with higher headquarters’ needs.
     2.4. Monitors will consolidate all multiple-page documents in one book. Personnel will
     keep the books in publication libraries for easier access. The books will include an index
     with all documents tabbed corresponding with the index. Monitors will make sure books are
     current and readily accessible.
     2.5. When organizational directives, other than this instruction, require specific documents
     be posted to official bulletin boards, the documents will be posted by the bulletin board
     monitor.
     2.6. Post all unofficial material according to the policy of the organization and ensure
     employee “For Sale” notices do not reference duty phone or office. This will prevent
     unauthorized use of government time and resources. Restricted unofficial material (such as
     political announcements, advertising of a commercial nature, and for sale items where a
     monetary gain will be made by a private company, organization, or group) is prohibited from
     being displayed.
     2.7. Remove outdated material at least weekly. Each temporary notice will have a removal
     date marked in the upper right-hand corner.
     2.8. Maintain all bulletin boards to present a neat appearance.
     2.9. No visual aids (VA) are to be posted unless they are numbered and controlled as
     specified in AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.          The Publishing
     Management office (75 ABW/SCXSS) assigns VA numbers.

3. Union Responsibilities.
   3.1. Posted information will be accomplished at union expense and will not contain material
   that is libelous, scurrilous, defamatory, or related to partisan politics.
   3.2. Union stewards will maintain the union portion of bulletin boards, ensuring that only
   authorized and approved materials are posted. (Reference Attachment 2 paragraph A2.2.)
   Stewards will also ensure that union bulletin boards conform to the same maintenance
   control requirements as prescribed for the official employee bulletin boards.
4. Prescribed and Adopted Forms.
   4.1. Prescribed forms.
        No forms prescribed.
   4.2. Adopted Forms.
        AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication
