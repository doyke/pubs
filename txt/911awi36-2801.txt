MEMORANDUM FOR 911 AW/SE

FROM: 911 LGS/LGSF (474-1234)

SUBJECT: Quarterly Ground Safety Mishap Prevention Award

       1. (Full Name) Helpe, Will I
          (Grade/ Rank) E-5/SSgt
          (Job Series/AFSC) 12X34
          (Unit or Organization) 123 AREFW

2. I nominate SSgt Helpe of the Hydrants Fuels Management Branch for the Ground Safety
Mishap Prevention Quarterly Award for the period of 1 Jan through 30 Mar 05.SSgt Helpe
identified a problem, which impacted the refueling support capability for the 123 AREFWand
the safety of all assigned C-130 aircraft. Fuel was trickling into a hydrant fueling outlet pit from
where the pipe enters the bottom of the pit. This indicated that the below ground fuel pipeline
was ruptured. With the system under pressure, the flow of fuel entering the pit increased,
confirming the underground leak. The hazard created by the leak had potential for a catastrophic
incident as well as serious environmental impact. The fuel pit is located next to the C-130
parking ramp. During routine inspection/maintenance the leak was detected. The ruptured fuel
pipeline was isolated and drained of remaining fuel. The isolation valve was tested to prevent re-
pressurization of the ruptured fuel line and found to be defective. The entire fuel system was
removed from operation, the defective valve was also removed and the piping was flanged with
no impact on flying operations. The prompt detection of the fuel leak and reaction to the valve
malfunction enabled actions to be immediately taken, which minimized hazards, eliminated
environmental pollution, and fuel lost. Due to his efforts, the dangers and environmental damage
associated with serious fuel leaks was eliminated with no impact on safety or the ecosystem.
